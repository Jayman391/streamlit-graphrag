    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether the routine use of intraoperative surface aortic ultrasonography decreases the stroke rate in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\nOne hundred ninety-five consecutive patients undergoing CABG between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1993 (study group), were evaluated by intraoperative surface aortic ultrasonography. Based on information obtained, changes in the operative technique were made in an effort to decrease the incidence of embolic stroke from unsuspected atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta. The outcome of these patients was compared with that of 164 consecutive patients who underwent CABG between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992 (control group), in whom the ascending aorta was assessed by inspection and palpation only.\nSignificant disease was detected in three (2.0%) of 164 patients in the control group. Modifications in their operative technique consisted of hypothermic fibrillatory arrest with no cross-clamping of the aorta and left ventricular venting in two patients and single cross-clamping in one patient. There were five strokes overall in this group (3.0%), and six patients died (3.6%), one in whom the stroke contributed directly to the cause of death. In the study group the ultrasonic findings were normal to mild in 168 patients, moderate in 20 patients, and severe in seven patients. These results led to a modification of the technique in 19 patients, (10%): hypothermic fibrillatory arrest with no cross-clamping of the aorta and left ventricular venting in 14 patients, modification in the aortic cannulation site or single cross-clamping in three patients, and modification in placement of proximal anastomoses or all arterial grafts in two patients. No strokes occurred in this group (p < 0.02, Fisher's exact test). Five patients died, for an operative mortality rate of 2.6%.\nThese data indicate that intraoperative ultrasonography of the ascending aorta with simple modifications in operative technique reduces the stroke rate in CABG.",

    "abstract": "Carotid duplex imaging has become the standard diagnostic evaluation for patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography expands the noninvasive diagnostic capabilities to the intracranial circulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of routine transcranial Doppler studies on patients referred for noninvasive cerebrovascular evaluation.\nA total of 670 patients had routine transcranial Doppler examinations as part of their noninvasive cerebrovascular evaluation. Patients were categorized clinically and according to their severity of extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis (< 50%, 50% to 79%, 80% to 99%, occlusion). Transcranial Doppler examinations were classified as normal or abnormal (intracranial stenosis, collateral pathway, > 30% velocity difference normal or abnormal (intracranial stenosis, collateral pathway, > 30% velocity difference between sides, flow reversal, and velocities +/- SD from normal).\nForty-eight percent of the patients were women, and 52% were men. The average age was 65.5 years. Fifty-four percent of the patients were white, 42% were black, 3% were Hispanic, and 1% were other. Forty-eight percent presented with hemispheric symptoms, 34% had no symptoms, and 18% had nonhemispheric symptoms. Forty-five percent (304 of 670) had an interpretable transcranial Doppler examination. The ability to insonate the basal cerebral arteries through the temporal bone was significantly reduced in women (p < 0.0001), black patients (p < 0.0001), and older patients (p < 0.0001). The results of forty-four percent of interpretable examinations were normal, 19% demonstrated side-to-side velocity differences, 13% showed collateral pathways, 11% showed velocities +/- 2 SD, 10% showed an intracranial stenosis, and 4% showed reversed flow pattern. Although 56% of the patients had notable findings, no patient had their diagnostic or therapeutic plan altered by the transcranial Doppler results.\nLess than 50% of the patients referred for first-time cerebrovascular examination had access for an interpretable transcranial Doppler examination. Though the number of positive findings is reasonably high, no material impact on diagnostic or treatment plans was seen in the patients in this series.

    "abstract": "Several studies have investigated the correlation between Doppler ultrasonography (DUS), angiography (CA), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the evaluation of stenosis of the carotid bifurcation. However, these studies suffer from the lack of a true control-the lesion itself-and therefore conclusions about the diagnostic accuracy of each method remain relative. To determine the absolute accuracy of these modalities, we have prospectively studied lesion size with DUS, MRA, and CA in 28 patients undergoing 31 elective carotid endarterectomies and compared the percent of carotid stenosis determined by each technique to the carotid atheroma resected en bloc.\nAll patients were evaluated by each modality within 1 month before the thromboendarterectomy. With DUS, stenosis size was determined by standard flow criteria. For angiography and MRA, stenosis was defined as residual lumenal diameter/estimated normal arterial diameter (European Carotid Surgery Trial criteria). At surgery the carotid atheroma was removed en bloc in all patients. Patients in whom the lesion could not be removed successfully without damage were excluded from the study. Stenosis of the atheroma was determined ex vivo with high-resolution (0.03 mm3) magnetic resonance and confirmed by acrylic injection of the specimen under pressure and measurement of the atheroma wall and lumen.\nThe measurements of the ex vivo stenosis by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging correlated closely with the size of stenosis determined by the acrylic specimen casts (r = 0.92). By ex vivo measurement, the lesions were placed in the following size categories: 40% to 59% stenosis (n = 2), 60% to 79% stenosis (n = 6), 80% to 89% stenosis (n = 7), and 90% to 99% stenosis (n = 16).\nIn general, the correlation of measurements of ex vivo stenosis with all modalities was good in these severely diseased arteries, although it was better for DUS (r = 0.80; p < 0.001) and MRA (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) than for CA (r = 0.56; p < 0.05).",

Special emphasis is placed on the influence of athletic or work activities on the axillary-subclavian artery system and the mechanism by which the humeral head compresses the axillary artery and the circumflex humeral arterial branches.\nRetrospective review identified 34 patients (age range 13 to 67 years) treated for upper extremity symptoms or ischemic complications of thoracic outlet syndrome from 1983 to 1993. Evaluation included assessment of occupational and recreational activities plus duplex ultrasonography and contrast arteriography with positional maneuvers.\nTwenty-two patients (27 arms) had subclavian artery injury, which was most commonly caused by compression by a bony abnormality (cervical rib, 16; anomalous first rib, two; cervical rib and anomalous first rib, two). Fourteen of the 27 arms had distal embolization. All 27 had surgical decompression of the subclavian artery; 15 required concomitant arterial reconstruction. Twelve additional patients (nine athletes) had axillary artery involvement, all from arterial compression by the head of the humerus during abduction maneuvers; all had concomitant compression of the posterior circumflex humeral artery. Axillary arterial injury included thrombosis (one), aneurysm (two), and symptomatic extrinsic compression only (nine). Five patients with axillary artery involvement were treated without a surgical procedure; of the remainder, three underwent decompression procedures only, and four had direct arterial repair. In both groups all subclavian and axillary artery reconstructions were patent at last follow-up examination (mean 31 months).\nMost patients with thoracic outlet syndrome who have arterial involvement have a bony anomaly causing subclavian artery compression. This study demonstrates that humeral head compression of the axillary artery and its circumflex branches is a surprisingly common pathologic mechanism. Awareness of this condition affords a better therapeutic approach to arterial injuries caused by thoracic outlet syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Many issues surrounding the management and outcome of carotid artery injuries remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to review a large contemporary experience with such injuries in the setting of designated trauma centers.\nA statewide computerized trauma registry was used to identify all patients with injuries to the common or internal carotid arteries from October 1987 to June 1993. The records of 82 such patients were retrieved and analyzed.\nOverall mortality and stroke rates were 17% and 28%, respectively. Patients presenting with coma or shock had a particularly bad prognosis (50% and 41% mortality, respectively). Internal carotid injuries resulted in mortality and stroke rates of 21% and 41%, respectively, compared with 11% each for common carotid injuries. Patients with blunt injuries had a much higher stroke rate (56% vs 15%) but had lower mortality (7% vs 22%) than did patients with penetrating injuries. Airway compromise and associated injuries did not affect prognosis. Operative repair and percutaneous balloon occlusion had the best survival and functional outcomes.\nOperative repair offers the best chances for recovery in all categories of patients regardless of injury mechanism. Ligation is useful only as a last-resort lifesaving effort. Shock and neurologic impairment are poor prognostic factors but should not negate repair.",

The groups were matched with regard to sex, diabetes, indication for surgical procedure, surgical procedure, and graft material. Intensive surveillance was clinical examination, ankle/brachial index measurements, and duplex scans 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 36 months after operation. Routine surveillance was clinical examination and ankle/brachial index measurements without duplex scanning 1, 12, 24, and 36 months after operation. Grafts with a decrease in ankle/brachial index of more than 0.15 compared with the initial postoperative ankle/brachial index or a duplex scan showing a graft or anastomotic stenosis of more than 50% underwent angiography and if necessary, a revision or repeat procedure. Occluded grafts were reopened with thrombectomy or thrombolysis or were replaced with a new graft.\nAssisted primary cumulative vein graft patency in the intensive group (n = 56) compared with that in the routine surveillance group (n = 50) after 3 years was 78% versus 53% (chi square analysis, 4.51; one degree of freedom; p < 0.05). Secondary patency was 82% versus 56% (chi square analysis, 5.62; one degree of freedom; p < 0.05). Assisted primary cumulative e-polytetrafluoroethylene and composite graft patency after 1 year in the intensive group (n = 23) compared with that of the routine surveillance group (n = 20) was 57% vs 50% (chi square analysis, 2.17; one degree of freedom; p > 0.1). Secondary patency was 67% vs 54% (chi square analysis, 1.85; one degree of freedom; p > 0.1). Revisions were made on 14 patent and 10 thrombosed grafts in the intensive group and on four patent and 15 thrombosed grafts in the routine surveillance group. All except eight were made during the first postoperative year.\nIntensive surveillance identified failing vein grafts leading to a significantly higher cumulative assisted primary and secondary patency compared with cumulative assisted primary and secondary patency after routine follow-up examination. The patency of e-polytetrafluoroethylene and composite grafts was not influenced by intensive surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the origin of vein graft lesions and their propensity for progression based on prospective duplex surveillance of 135 infrainguinal vein bypasses.\nOne hundred sixteen greater saphenous, 13 spliced, five cephalic, and one superficial femoral vein grafts were evaluated by color duplex imaging at surgical procedure, 1 and 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Duplex-identified lesions were graded by peak systolic velocity and velocity ratio criteria and were either followed or subjected to revision.\nEarly postoperative duplex surveillance allowed stratification of infrainguinal grafts into two subsets. Of 91 (67%) grafts with normal early scans (at 3 months), only two (2.2%) developed de novo stenoses (at 6 and 8 months) that required revision. Forty-four grafts with abnormal duplex scans had a focal flow abnormality (peak systolic velocity > 150 cm/sec, velocity ratio > 1.5) in the graft body (n = 24) or anastomotic region (n = 20). In 14 grafts the flow abnormality (mean peak systolic velocity = 217 cm/sec, velocity ratio = 2.3) normalized. Ten additional grafts exhibited a moderate, persistent graft stenosis (mean peak systolic velocity 248 cm/sec, velocity ratio = 3.3) that was not repaired. All 20 grafts with lesions that progressed to high-grade stenosis (mean peak systolic velocity = 362 cm/sec, velocity ratio = 7.2) and were revised had a residual flow abnormality confirmed at operation, or it appeared by 6 weeks. In the entire series six (4.4%) grafts failed during the mean 12-month follow-up interval (range 3 to 30 months), 4 with unrepaired defects and two after revision.\nProspective duplex surveillance verified that de novo graft stenosis was uncommon (< 2.2%) after reversed and in situ saphenous vein bypass grafting. Graft stenoses developed at sites of unrepaired defects or early appearing conduit abnormalities. An early appearing duplex focal flow abnormality warranted careful surveillance, because one half of such sites progressed to a high-grade stenosis. Grafts with normal early duplex scans exhibited a low incidence of stenosis development or occlusion, and thus less intense postoperative surveillance can be recommended.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify high-risk populations for severe carotid artery disease (SCD) and neurologic events (NE) after nonemergency isolated coronary artery bypass graft procedures (CABG).\nBetween February 1989 and July 1992, 387 patients underwent preoperative carotid artery duplex scanning as part of a preoperative assessment for nonemergency cardiac procedures. Of these patients, 376 had isolated CABG, and 11 had combined carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and CABG. Patient demographics, risk factors, and preoperative neurologic symptoms were recorded and analyzed. Severe carotid artery disease was defined as a 80% or greater stenosis of either internal carotid artery by carotid artery duplex scanning. Patients were evaluated for neurologic events (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, or reversible ischemic neurologic deficits) during the in-hospital postoperative period.\nThe prevalence of SCD was 8.5% (33 patients). The 33 patients with SCD were significantly older (65.6 +/- 6.5 years vs 62.5 +/- 10.4 years, p = 0.02), had previous CEA (27.3% vs 2.0%, p = 0.00001), had preoperative neurologic symptoms (21.2% vs 5.9%, p = 0.002), and had peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (63.6% vs 16.9%, p = 0.00001). The sensitivity of PVD for SCD is 63.6% (n = 21/33) (specificity 83.1%, positive predictive value 25.9%, negative predictive value 96.1%). In patients undergoing CABG alone, those who had postoperative NE were older (69.6 +/- 6.7 years vs 62.5 +/- 10.3 years, p = 0.036) and more likely to have PVD (50% vs 19.7%, p = 0.034), SCD (40% vs 4.9%, p = 0.001) and previous CEA (40% vs 2.7%, p = 0.0002). The incidence of postoperative NE in patients with SCD was 18.2% vs 1.7% in patients without SCD (p = 0.001). The sensitivity of SCD for NE was 40% (n = 4/10) (specificity 95.1%, positive predictive value 18.2%, negative predictive value 98.3%).\nPVD may be helpful to identify patients at high risk for severe carotid artery stenosis. Postoperative NE in patients with CABG are associated with increasing age, carotid artery stenosis greater than 80%, previous CEA, and PVD.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to assess the natural history of carotid artery stenosis in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at a Veterans Administration Medical Center.\nBetween January 1989 and August 1993, all patients undergoing CPB were offered preoperative carotid artery ultrasound screening as part of an investigative protocol. Patients were monitored in-hospital for the occurrence of perioperative neurologic deficit.\nA total of 582 patients underwent carotid artery ultrasound screening. Greater than 50% stenosis or occlusion of one or both internal carotid arteries was present in 130 patients (22%), with 80% or greater stenosis or occlusion of one or both arteries present in 70 patients (12%). In-hospital stroke or death occurred in 12 (2.1%) and 36 (6.2%) patients, respectively. Of the 12 strokes, five were global and seven were hemispheric in distribution. Of the five patients who had global events, none had evidence of carotid artery stenosis. However, of the seven patients who had hemispheric events, five had significant 50% or greater stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery ipsilateral to the hemispheric stroke. Therefore the presence of carotid artery stenosis or occlusion was significantly associated with hemispheric stroke (no stenosis 0.34% vs stenosis 3.8%; p = 0.0072). Furthermore, the risk of hemispheric stroke in patients with unilateral 80% to 99% stenosis, bilateral 50% to 99% stenosis, or unilateral occlusion with contralateral 50% or greater stenosis was 5.3% (4 of 75). No strokes occurred in patients with unilateral 50% to 79% stenosis (n = 52).\nIt is concluded that carotid atherosclerosis is a risk factor for hemispheric stroke in patients undergoing CPB.",

    "abstract": "The effect of near-wall blood flow velocity and plasma filtration velocity across the arterial wall on luminal surface concentration of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and the uptake of tritium-cholesterol were investigated.\nA numeric analysis of LDL transport in steady flow, over the range of physiologically relevant flow rates, predicted a surface concentration of LDL of 4% to 16% greater than that in the bulk flow. The LDL surface concentration increased linearly with filtration velocity and inversely with wall shear rate.\nThese were validated experimentally in canine carotid arteries. When the transmural pressure was increased from 100 to 200 mm Hg, the filtration velocity increased from 5.13 x 10(-6) cm/sec to 8.41 x 10(-6) cm/sec, whereas the normalized uptake rate of tritium-cholesterol increased from 3.58 x 10(-4) cm/hour to 7.36 x 10(-4) cm/hour.\nThese results indicate that lipids accumulate at the luminal surface in areas where blood flow velocity and wall shear stress are low and where the permeability of the endothelial layer is enhanced. Moreover, the rate of lipid infiltration into the blood vessel walls is affected by the luminal surface concentration.

The carotid artery duplex ultrasound surveillance program at the University of Washington Department of Vascular Surgery has serially evaluated patients with carotid artery disease for more than a decade and provides data on the progress and management of this disease.\nPatients with asymptomatic carotid artery bruits who had carotid artery disease causing less than 80% lumen diameter narrowing at their initial visit were identified. At each return visit (6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter) a clinical questionnaire was completed, and bilateral carotid artery duplex sonography was performed.\nTwo hundred thirty-two patients (136 men and 96 women) were monitored for up to 10 years with sufficient data for a 7-year life-table analysis. Progression in the degree of stenosis was noted in 23% of patients during follow-up, and nearly half of these progressed to severe stenosis (80% to 99%) or occlusion. The risk of progression to severe stenosis and occlusion was significantly greater for those patients with moderate initial stenosis than mild initial stenosis (p < 0.01). The cumulative stroke risk for patients with mild initial stenosis (6%) was half of that for patients with moderate initial stenosis (11%) after 7 years. Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 27 patients during follow-up; in 13 the indication was an event ipsilateral to the stenosis, and in 14 there was asymptomatic progression to high-grade stenosis.\nRegular monitoring of mild to moderate carotid artery stenosis shows how these lesions progress over time, permitting a realistic appraisal of their potential for producing an ischemic cerebrovascular event.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for stroke in patients undergoing heart surgery.\nA retrospective chart review of patients who underwent cardiac surgery in three hospitals of the State University of New York at Buffalo system over a 36-month period was completed. Demographics and risk factors were recorded, and stroke and death were determined by chart review. Carotid artery stenosis was determined by duplex examination. Data were analyzed by chi-squared and multiple logistic regression.\nOne thousand one hundred seventy-nine cases were analyzed, with a mortality rate of 2.3%, stroke rate of 1.6%, and combined stroke/death rate of 3.1%. Four variables were found to be associated with an increased risk of stroke: carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%, redo heart surgery, valve surgery, and prior stroke. Five variables were associated with increased mortality rates:; carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%, redo surgery, peripheral vascular disease, longer pump time, and hypercholesterolemia. Carotid artery stenosis greater than 50% was present in 14.7% of cases. Carotid artery stenosis greater than 75% was not itself associated with increased stroke risk. Most strokes occurred more than 24 hours after surgery. Stroke distribution did not correlate with site of carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%.\nMost neurologic events after heart surgery occur in a subset of patients who can be defined before operation. Whereas carotid artery stenosis greater than 50% is a strong risk factor, the role of prophylactic endarterectomy is unclear. Future studies should focus on this high-risk subgroup. A prospective study of prophylactic carotid endarterectomy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting is needed.",

Five variables were associated with increased mortality rates:; carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%, redo surgery, peripheral vascular disease, longer pump time, and hypercholesterolemia. Carotid artery stenosis greater than 50% was present in 14.7% of cases. Carotid artery stenosis greater than 75% was not itself associated with increased stroke risk. Most strokes occurred more than 24 hours after surgery. Stroke distribution did not correlate with site of carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of disease progression of moderate (50% to 79%) internal carotid artery stenosis in patients with symptoms, patients with nonhemispheric symptoms, and symptom-free patients and to define the risk of development of new neurologic events in each group.\nOver a 6-year period, 272 patients with moderate internal carotid artery stenoses were monitored for a mean of 44 months with color-flow duplex scanning (CFS). At the time of the initial scan, 142 patients were symptom free, 87 had experienced transient ischemic attacks, amaurosis fugax, or mild strokes, and 43 had ill-defined nonhemispheric symptoms. The average number of follow-up scans was 2.4 per patient (range 1 to 11).\nDuring follow-up, 23 (26%) of the patients with symptoms, 17 (40%) of the patients with nonhemispheric symptoms, and 30 (21%) of the symptom-free patients had development of additional neurologic symptoms. Life-table comparison of ipsilateral ischemic events showed a significantly (p = 0.03) higher cumulative rate in the symptomatic group (20%) than in the asymptomatic group (7%) at 2 years. Mean annual stroke rates were 6% and 2% in patients in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, respectively. None of the patients in the nonhemispheric group had a stroke within 4 years of the initial study. Disease progression occurred in 16% of the patients. In the asymptomatic group, ipsilateral stroke occurred more frequently (p = 0.0001) in patients with disease progression (25%) than in patients with stable lesions (1%). CFS detected disease progression in 19 (79%) of 24 patients before the artery occluded or stroke occurred. In patients with symptoms, stroke was more frequent (p = 0.02) in patients with six or more risk factors (29%) than in those with five or fewer risk factors (7%).\nAlthough the risk of stroke is less in patients with moderate stenosis than it is in patients with severely stenotic lesions, symptom-free patients with advancing disease and patients with symptoms and multiple risk factors are at increased risk for development of neurologic events. These findings support the use of CFS to monitor patients with carotid artery disease and suggest that a more aggressive surgical approach may be indicated in selected patients with moderate carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Few articles have dealt specifically with surgical management of innominate artery (IA) atherosclerotic occlusive disease. We herein present our early and long-term results in a large series of patients.\nDuring a 20-year period (1974 to 1993) we operated on 148 patients with IA atherosclerotic occlusive disease. The mean age was 55.8 +/- 9.4 years. Approach was through a median sternotomy in 135 (91%) patients. Endarterectomy was performed in 32 (22%) patients, whereas 116 (78%) patients underwent bypass.\nEight (5.4%) patients died in the perioperative period (four of heart-related causes, two of hemorrhage, one each of pulmonary infection and multiorgan failure). There were five (3.4%) perioperative strokes (three ipsilateral, two contralateral) and three (2.0%) ipsilateral perioperative transient ischemic attacks. Ten (7%) patients were lost to follow-up. Mean follow-up was 77 (2 to 193) months. Thirty-three (24%) patients were monitored 10 or more years. There were 45 (35%) late deaths (19 from cardiovascular-related causes, 15 from cancer, 7 from other known causes, and 4 from unknown causes). Although 11 (8.5%) patients had late neurologic events, only one late stroke occurred in the contralateral hemisphere and no ipsilateral late strokes occurred. Sixteen (11%) patients had late myocardial infarctions, nine of which were lethal. Life-table analysis and perioperative events were used to calculate the probability of survival, which was 77.5% +/- 9.5% and 51.9% +/- 20.8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, with a 4.4% annual mortality rate. The overall probability of freedom from any neurologic/ocular event was 88.8% +/- 6.2% and 80.4% +/- 11.9% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, with a 1.6% annual occurrence rate. The probability of freedom from ipsilateral neurologic/ocular event was 92.7% +/- 4.8% and 84.0% +/- 11.2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, with a 1.4% annual occurrence rate. The probability of freedom from ipsilateral stroke was 98.6% +/- 1.9% at 5 and 10 years. The primary patency rate was 98.4% +/- 2.1% and 96.3% +/- 4.7% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The probability of freedom from reoperation was 95.6% +/- 3.9% and 93.5% +/- 5.9% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.\nSurgical reconstruction of IA atherosclerotic occlusive disease yields acceptable rates of perioperative complications and late mortality and excellent long-term patency and freedom from neurologic events and reoperation.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated changes in the deep venous system and the development of the postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after an episode of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nSeventy-eight patients (41 male patients, 37 female patients) with acute DVT in 83 legs (31 right, 42 left, five bilateral) underwent annual follow-up examinations for 1 to 6 years (median, 3 years) for symptoms and signs of the PTS. A venous duplex scan was performed at each visit to detect obstruction and reflux in the veins, both of which may contribute to the development of the PTS. DVT was primary in 69 limbs and recurrent in 14 limbs.\nWhen last examined 49 limbs were free of symptoms, and 34 had the PTS (23 edema only, 11 hyperpigmentation). Only two patients had ulcers during the follow-up period; both patients had the ulcers in areas of hyperpigmentation in limbs with recurrent DVT. The extent of disease was similar in limbs with the PTS (79% multisegment, 18% single segment) and those without the PTS (69% multisegment, 12% single segment). In limbs with the PTS the deep veins were normal in only one (3%), six (18%) showed reflux only, five (15%) obstruction only, and 22 had features of both obstruction and reflux (65%). In limbs without the PTS the deep veins showed no abnormality in nine (18%), reflux only in 17 (35%), obstruction only in six (12%), and reflux with obstruction in 17 (35%). In the 11 limbs with hyperpigmentation nine had obstruction and reflux noted, one had obstruction only, and one had reflux alone.\nAfter an episode of acute DVT 12% of the limbs returned to normal by duplex criteria. Although only 13% developed skin complications, 41% had features of the PTS. Limbs with the PTS had more than three times the odds of having combined reflux and obstruction than did limbs without the PTS (odds ratio = 3.5, 0.95 confidence intervals = 1.4, 8.6). Continued study of these patients will determine the course of those limbs with venous abnormalities that have not yet developed symptoms and signs of the PTS.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether aortic size influences late patency of aortofemoral reconstructions in men and women with premature atherosclerosis.\nWe studied 37 consecutive young women (mean age +/- SEM, 44 +/- .7 years) and 36 young men (mean age 44 +/- .8 years) who underwent elective operations for aortoiliac occlusive disease during the past 15 years. Clinical data from patients with occluded versus patent grafts were studied, and angiographic findings in patients with occluded versus patent grafts and in young adult patients in a control group (n = 50) who had nonatherosclerotic conditions were compared.\nTwenty (54%) women and 17 (47%) men had limb occlusions within a mean of 31 +/- 6 months. These occlusions resulted in major amputations in 17 (23%) patients. When patients with occluded versus patent grafts were compared no differences were found in age, sex, symptoms, type or number of atherosclerotic risk factors, or operative details. As a whole, patients in the study group had smaller infrarenal aortas than did patients in the control group (p = 0.009). Women with limb occlusions had smaller infrarenal aortas than did women with patent grafts (p = 0.03) or healthy female patients in the control group (p = 0.002). Men with limb occlusions had smaller infrarenal aortas than did men with patent grafts (p = 0.017) or male patients in the control group (p < 0.001). Angiographic outflow scores were not different in men or women with occluded versus patent grafts. Among all variables studied proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that only mean infrarenal aortic diameter was predictive of graft patency.\nThese data suggest that late graft failure after aortofemoral reconstruction is common in young adults. Patients with premature atherosclerosis have smaller infrarenal aortas compared with young adults in a control group, making them more vulnerable to symptoms from atherosclerotic lesions. Size of the infrarenal aortic segment is a critical determinant of late graft patency regardless of sex.",

Men with limb occlusions had smaller infrarenal aortas than did men with patent grafts (p = 0.017) or male patients in the control group (p < 0.001). Angiographic outflow scores were not different in men or women with occluded versus patent grafts.

    "abstract": "To determine the optimal surgical strategies in reoperative infrainguinal bypass, we reviewed our results in 300 consecutive secondary bypasses in 251 patients operated on between Jan. 1, 1975, and Nov. 1, 1993.\nThere were 168 men (67%) and 83 women (33%), with a mean age of 64.8 years and a typical distribution of risk factors including smoking (76.4%), diabetes (33.7%), and coronary artery disease (47.1%). The indications for surgery were limb-threatening ischemia in 83.5% and severe claudication in 16.5% of patients. The majority of conduits (n = 213) were autogenous vein and were composed of a single segment of greater saphenous vein in 121 bypasses (57%) and various alternative veins including composite, arm, and lesser saphenous vein in 92 bypasses (43%). Prosthetic conduits included 69 polytetrafluoroethylene, 16 umbilical vein, and two Dacron grafts.\nThere was one perioperative death (0.3%) and a 25% total morbidity rate including a 1.7% myocardial infarction rate. There was a 28.6% early (< 30 days) graft failure and 10.7% early amputation rate for prosthetic bypass grafts compared with 13.6% early graft failure and 5.6% early amputation rates for vein grafts. Autogenous vein bypasses had higher 5-year secondary patency rates than had prosthetic grafts (51.5% +/- 4.6% vs 27.4% +/- 6.1%, p < 0.001). Results with autogenous vein bypass improved significantly from the 1975 to 1984 to the 1985 to 1993 interval with 5-year secondary patency rates increasing from 38.3% +/- 6.9% to 59.1% +/- 5.8% (p = 0.017) and 5-year limb-salvage rates increasing from 40.4% +/- 7.6% to 72.4% +/- 6.6% (p < 0.001). Vein grafts to the popliteal and tibial outflow levels had equivalent long-term results. Vein grafts completed for claudication demonstrated results superior to those for limb salvage, with a 5-year secondary patency rate of 75.8% +/- 8.1% versus 52.3% +/- 7.9% (p = 0.048). Secondary autogenous vein bypass grafting performed after early primary graft failure (< 3 months) did particularly poorly, with only a 27.2% +/- 7.7% 4-year secondary patency rate. Greater saphenous veins tended to perform better than alternative vein bypasses, with a 5-year secondary patency rate of 68.5% +/- 6.0% compared with 48.3% +/- 10.5% (p = 0.09) and a 5-year limb-salvage rate of 77.8% +/- 7.4% versus 54.2% +/- 11.8% (p = 0.046).\nWhen patients suffer a recurrence of limb-threatening ischemia at the time of infrainguinal graft failure, aggressive attempts at secondary revascularization with autogenous vein are warranted based on the low surgical morbidity and mortality rates and the improved patency and limb salvage rates that are currently attainable.",

    "abstract": "The role of arterial stenting in the treatment of femoral and popliteal arterial disease is controversial and has been hampered by recommendations for patients to be given anticoagulants (oral warfarin) for several months or more. This study was undertaken to evaluate the immediate and midterm outcomes of vascular stents implanted percutaneously in the femoral and popliteal arteries, without long-term anticoagulation.\nOver a 3-year period, 32 patients admitted to a vascular surgery service had arterial stents implanted in the femoral (n = 22) or popliteal (n = 10) artery for the following indications: recurrent stenosis after angioplasty (n = 13), suboptimal result after angioplasty of occluded (n = 12) or calcified stenotic arteries (n = 2), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty-induced thrombosis or dissection (n = 5). Access to the artery was gained by percutaneous insertion of a hemostatic sheath into the ipsilateral common femoral artery. Systemic heparin was given at the time of stent insertion, and patients were prescribed daily low-dose aspirin.\nSuccessful stent implantation was achieved in 31 of the 32 patients. Acute thrombosis (< 30 days) occurred in two patients. There was no incidence of false aneurysm formation, acute leg ischemia, or vessel perforation. All patients were monitored by Doppler scanning index and duplex scanning within 24 hours, and thereafter at 3- to 6-month intervals. The mean ankle-brachial systolic pressure index improved from 0.60 (before treatment) to 0.88 (3 to 6 months after stenting). Stent occlusion has occurred in six patients; two stents were successfully salvaged with urokinase infusion. In follow-up to date (range 3 to 33 months) the primary patency rate by life-table analysis was 75% at 18 months, whereas the secondary patency rate was 89% at the same interval. Restenosis (> 50% lumen diameter) was detected by duplex ultrasonography in seven of 25 patent stents (28%) at a mean interval of 9.5 months (range 4 to 15 months); of these, four patients remained clinically symptom-free despite the ultrasound findings.\nWe conclude that vascular stents can be implanted into the femoropopliteal arteries with few complications and with acceptable early and intermediate patency rates, without the need for long-term anticoagulation. Restenosis is not prevented by stents, and the main value of stenting at this site appears to be in salvaging acute complications of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or to correct suboptimal results after recanalization of occluded arteries.",

    "abstract": "Directional atherectomy is an endovascular interventional technique for excision and removal of obstructive arterial lesions. To evaluate whether atherectomy would provide better results than conventional balloon angioplasty (BA) in symptomatic femoropopliteal disease, a prospective randomized study comparing the early and late outcomes of these techniques was conducted. The rate of restenosis or occlusion was assessed by use of color-flow duplex scanning during the follow-up period.\nSeventy-three patients were randomized between atherectomy (38 patients) and BA (35 patients). All patients had segmental lesions of the femoropopliteal arteries amenable to either technique. The median follow-up duration was 13 months (range 1 to 39). Follow-up comprised regular clinical and hemodynamic assessment and color-flow duplex examinations. Restenosis was defined on the basis of a peak systolic velocity ratio of 2.5 or greater, and occlusion of the treated segment was diagnosed if flow signals were absent, that is, loss of patency.\nResidual stenoses (> or = 30% diameter reduction) resulted in five patients (13%) undergoing atherectomy and three patients (9%) undergoing BA. At 1 month clinical and hemodynamic improvement by Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery criteria for lower limb ischemia was observed in 34 patients (89%) treated with atherectomy and in 34 (97%) treated with BA. By life-table analysis the cumulative rate of clinical and hemodynamic success at 2 years was 52% in patients treated with atherectomy and 87% in patients treated with BA (p = 0.06). The patency rate at 2 years of treated segments was 34% in the atherectomy group and 56% in patients treated with BA (p = 0.07). In patients with lesions greater than 2 cm, the 1-year patency rate of AT was significantly lower than BA (p = 0.03).\nAtherectomy does not result in an improved clinical and hemodynamic outcome. Furthermore atherectomy of segmental atherosclerotic femoropopliteal disease does not result in a better patency rate than BA, and, in lesions with greater length than 2 cm, the atherectomy results are significantly worse.",

    "abstract": "A variety of vena caval filters (VCFs) are available for usage. The choice of filter type depends on physician preference and certain patient variables. An evaluation of the different VCFs used in our institution was done to compare their efficacy and complication rates.\nThe medical records of all patients who underwent insertion of a VCF from January 1987 to June 1993 at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics and the affiliated Veterans Administration Medical Center were reviewed. One hundred ninety-nine VCFs were placed in 196 patients (123 males, 73 females), with a mean age of 61 years (range 13 to 87 years). Thirty-five (18%) VCFs (30 stainless steel Greenfield filters [SGFs] and five titanium Greenfield filters with modified hook [TGF-MHs]) were inserted in the operating room via an open technique. The remaining 164 VCFs (82%) were inserted in the radiology suite by a percutaneous technique (38 SGF, 23 TGF-MH, 51 Vena Tech filters [VTFs], 48 Bird's nest filters [BNFs] and 4 Simon Nitinol filters). Thromboembolic risk factors in these 196 patients included malignancy (99), trauma (21), recent surgery (27), cerebrovascular accident with paralysis (6), and miscellaneous conditions (43). Indications for VCF placement included a contraindication to anticoagulation (92), complication of anticoagulation (44), failure of anticoagulation (26), prophylaxis (31), adjunct to pulmonary embolectomy (1), noncompliance (1), hemodynamically unstable patient (1), and prior VCF complication (3). Mean follow-up of the patients was 12 months (range 0 to 87 months). Because there were only four Simon Nitinol filters inserted during the study period, they were excluded from further analysis.\nA comparative analysis revealed that there was a significantly higher incidence of symptomatic IVC thrombosis with the use of the BNF (n = 7) (14.6%) versus the SGF (n = 0) (0%), TGF-MH (n = 1) (3.6%), or VTF (n = 2) (4%) (p < 0.05 by chi-squared testing). The VCF-related mortality rate was also higher with the BNF (n = 5) (10.9%) versus the SGF (n = 1) (1.5%), TGF-MH (n = 1) (3.6%), or VTF (n = 0) (0%) (p < 0.05 by chi-squared testing). However there was no significant difference in the occurrence of clinically apparent recurrent pulmonary embolism during follow-up between the four different filter types (2 [4.2%] BNF, 3 [4.4%] SGF, 1 [3.6%] TGF-MH, and 1 [2%] VTF).\nThese data indicate that the use of the BNF was associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates compared with the use of the SGF, TGF-MH, and VTF filters.",

    "abstract": "Downstream anastomotic intimal hyperplasia in prosthetic arterial grafts remains a major cause of delayed graft failure. The new method of messenger RNA (mRNA) differential display was used to screen numerous genes to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of intimal hyperplasia.\nFifty-centimeter-long 8 mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were placed in four mongrel dogs from the carotid artery to the distal abdominal aorta. At 3 months the distal anastomoses and adjacent normal aortas were harvested; a portion was taken for histologic examination, and total RNA was isolated from the remainder. Differential mRNA display was used to identify candidate cDNA clones whose expression differed in anastomotic intimal hyperplasia as compared with adjacent unaffected aorta. The clones were sequenced, and national gene databases were searched. Northern blot analysis confirmed alteration of gene expression.\nApproximately 5000 mRNA species were screened, and 11 candidate clones were obtained. DNA sequence revealed homology of five clones to known gene sequences. Homologous genes included an interferon-gamma-induced human gene, (IGUP I-5111), alpha-1 protease inhibitor gene, human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, and human creatine kinase gene (two clones). Northern blot analysis revealed altered gene expression in 4 of 11, nonregulation in 1 of 11, and undetectable signals in 6 of 11. Expression of the clone representing IGUP I-5111 in the segment of intimal hyperplasia was found to be decreased over threefold to only 31% +/- 16.4% SE of the level seen in normal aorta.\nThe technique of mRNA differential display has identified differences in gene expression in an in vivo model of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. Expression of RNA with homology to an interferon-gamma-induced human gene was consistently decreased within the hyperplastic region at the downstream polytetrafluoroethylene arterial anastomosis.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to characterize the changing operative treatment of pediatric renovascular hypertension and subsequent outcomes in a 30-year experience at a single institution.\nClinical data were analyzed on 57 pediatric patients, 24 girls and 33 boys, ranging in age from 10 months to 17 years, who underwent operations for renovascular hypertension from 1963 to 1993 at the University of Michigan. Renal artery disease included atypical medial-perimedial dysplasia, often with secondary intimal fibroplasia (88%), and inflammatory mural fibrosis (12%). Abdominal aortic narrowings affected 15 patients. Data were categorized into three chronologic eras (I:1963-1972, II:1973-1980, and III:1981-1993) to allow identification of therapeutic trends.\nPrimary surgical procedures were undertaken 74 times. Ex vivo reconstruction was necessary once. Primary operations included aortorenal bypass with autogenous vein grafts (n = 26) or internal iliac artery grafts (n = 7); iliorenal bypass with vein grafts (n = 2); renal artery resection beyond the stenosis and reimplantation into the aorta (n = 10), the main renal artery (n = 2), an adjacent segmental renal artery (n = 3), or the superior mesenteric artery (n = 3); renal artery resection and reanastomosis (n = 3); focal renal arterioplasty (n = 2); operative dilation (n = 7); splenorenal bypass (n = 2); and primary nephrectomy (n = 7). Among 23 primary operations performed in era I, 56.5% were aortorenal bypasses with vein grafts, but in era III this form of revascularization represented only 3% of 33 primary operations. No reimplantations were performed in era I, whereas reimplantations accounted for 51.5% of era III procedures. Thirteen patients underwent staged or concomitant aortic reconstructions with thoracoabdominal aortoaortic bypass grafts (n = 5) or patch aortoplasty (n = 8). Fourteen patients underwent a total of 20 secondary operations, including seven secondary nephrectomies. Operative therapy benefited 98% of these children: hypertension was cured in 45 (79%), improved in 11 (19%), and unchanged in one (2%). There were no operative deaths.\nContemporary surgical management emphasizes direct reimplantation of main renal arteries into the aorta, reimplantation of segmental arteries into adjacent renal arteries, patch aortoplasty for associated abdominal aortic coarctations, and single-stage revascularizations. Pediatric patients with renovascular hypertension clearly benefit from carefully executed operative therapy.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective review describes surgical management of dialysis-dependent ischemic nephropathy.\nFrom February 1987 through September 1993, 340 patients underwent operative renal artery (RA) reconstruction at our center. A subgroup of 20 patients (6 women; 14 men; mean age 66 years) dependent on hemodialysis immediately before RA repair form the basis of this report. Glomerular filtration rates (EGFR) were estimated from at least three serum creatinine measurements obtained 26 weeks before and after operation. A linear regression model was used to estimate the mean rate of change of EGFR before and after RA repair. Comparative analysis of kidney status and change in EGFR were performed. The influence of function response on follow-up survival was determined by the product-limit method.\nHemodialysis was discontinued in 16 of 20 patients (80%). For these 16 patients, postoperative EGFR ranged from 9.0 to 56.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 (mean 32.4 ml/min/1.73 m2). Two of 16 patients resumed hemodialysis 4 and 6 months after surgery. Discontinuation of dialysis was more likely after bilateral or complete RA repair (15 of 16 patients) versus unilateral repair (one of four patients; p = 0.01). Permanent discontinuation of dialysis was associated with a rapid preoperative rate of decline in EGFR (mean slope log(e) EGFR: -0.1393 +/- 0.0340 without dialysis; -0.0188 +/- 0.0464 with dialysis; p = 0.04, but NS after controlling for multiple comparisons). Immediate increase in EGFR after operation was inversely correlated with the severity of nephrosclerosis (rank correlation: -0.57; 95% confidence interval [-0.83, -0.10]). Follow-up death was associated with dialysis dependence; two deaths occurred among 14 patients not receiving dialysis, whereas five of six patients dependent on dialysis died (p < 0.01).\nSurgical correction of ischemic nephropathy can retrieve renal function in selected patients dependent on dialysis characterized by a rapid decline in preoperative EGFR in combination with global renal ischemia treated by complete or bilateral renal revascularization. After RA repair, discontinuation of dialysis may be associated with improved survival rates when compared with continued dialysis dependence.",

    "abstract": "The standard treatment for secondary aortoenteric fistula (SAEF) has been infected graft removal (IGR) and extraanatomic bypass (EAB), an approach criticized for its high rate of death, amputation, and disruption of aortic closure. Recently, graft excision and in situ graft replacement has been proposed as a safer treatment alternative. Because the current outcome that can be achieved by use of the standard treatment of SAEF has really not been established, we reviewed the records of 33 patients treated for SAEF at our institution during a contemporary time interval (1980 to 1992).\nThirteen patients (39.4%) were admitted with evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and infection, whereas nine (27.3%) only had bleeding, 10 (30.3%) only had signs of infection, and one SAEF was entirely occult (graft thrombosis). Four patients required emergency operation. The fistula type was anastomotic in 13 (39.4%) patients, paraprosthetic in 15 (45.5%), and not specified in 4 cases. Thirty-two patients underwent EAB followed immediately by IGR (n = 16, 48.5%) or followed by IGR after a short interval, averaging 3.9 days (n = 16, 48.5%). The final patient underwent IGR, followed by EAB.\nFollow-up on 31 patients (93.9%) averaged 4.4 +/- 3.7 years. There were nine deaths (27.3%) resulting from the SAEF, six perioperative and three late. Three patients (9.1%) had disrupted aortic closure. There were four amputations in three patients (9.1%), two perioperative and two late. Late EAB infection occurred in five patients (15.2%), leading to one death and one amputation. EAB failure occurred in six patients, two during operation and four late, leading to one amputation. The cumulative cure rate for this SAEF group was 70% at 3 years and thereafter. Compared with our earlier SAEF experience, this is a decline of 21% in the mortality rate, 19% in aortic disruption, and 27% in limb loss.\nWe conclude that outcome reports based on SAEF series extending over long time intervals do not accurately represent the results that are currently achieved with standard SAEF treatment with use of EAB plus IGR. This improved outcome is attributed to wide debridement of infected tissue beds, reduced intervals of lower body ischemia, and advances in perioperative management. To determine whether any new treatment approach actually offers improved outcome in the management of SAEF, comparison with EAB plus IGR should be limited to patients treated within the last decade at most.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to perform a randomized, prospective trial that compares the transabdominal with the retroperitoneal approach to the aorta for routine infrarenal aortic reconstruction.\nFrom August 1990 through November 1993, patients undergoing surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease or aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) were asked to participate in a randomized trial comparing the transabdominal incision (TAI) to the retroperitoneal incision (RPI) for aortic surgery. One hundred forty-five patients were randomized, with 75 (41 with AAA and 34 with AIOD) in the TAI group and 70 (40 with AAA and 30 with AIOD) in the RPI group. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, sex, postoperative pain control (epidural vs patient-controlled analgesia), or comorbid conditions, except for a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the TAI group (21 vs 8 patients).\nThe incidence of intraoperative complications was similar for both groups. After surgery, the incidence of prolonged ileus (p = 0.013) and small bowel obstruction (p = 0.05) was higher in the TAI group. Overall, the RPI group had significantly fewer complications (p < 0.0001). The overall postoperative mortality rate (two deaths) was 1.4%, with both occurring in the TAI group (p = 0.507). The RPI group also had significantly shorter stays in the intensive care unit (p = 0.006), a trend toward shorter hospitalization (p = 0.10), lower total hospital charges (p = 0.019), and lower total hospital costs (p = 0.017). There was no difference in pulmonary complications (p = 0.71). In long-term follow-up (mean 23 months), the RPI group reported more incisional pain (p = 0.056), but no difference was found in incisional hernias or bulges (p = 0.297).\nWe conclude that the RPI approach for abdominal aortic surgery is associated with fewer postoperative complications, shorter stays in the hospital and intensive care unit, and lower cost. There is, however, an increase in long-term incisional pain. Current methods of postoperative pain control seem to decrease the incidence of pulmonary complications.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons know vascular disease and its treatment, yet uncertainties about the future of their specialty require an examination of its two basic components: knowledge and know-how. Knowledge, or understanding, flows from research efforts, and expands the scientific basis of our medical knowledge. It is imperative that new knowledge through funded research continues so that vascular surgical science progresses. Know-how, or skill, is a crucial component of the vascular surgeon's armamentarium and has been recognized through our history as a criterion of a surgeon's proficiency. The vascular fellowship program provides the vascular surgical trainee with the knowledge and know-how necessary to become accomplished and qualified for certification in this specialty. Future progress in vascular surgery depends on new knowledge and know-how and their innovative application to human vascular disease. This may involve a formal cooperative relationship between the two national vascular societies and our colleagues in interventional radiology to develop a comprehensive vascular health care program. The societies together must continually evaluate the forces for change that are prevalent in the health care environment to expand this program. This will ensure a healthy forecast for our dynamic specialty in the twenty-first century.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental studies have established the feasibility of therapeutic angiogenesis; in all cases, this has been achieved with local administration of angiogenic growth factors. This study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that systemic administration of an angiogenic growth factor specifically mitogenic for endothelial cells--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)--could augment collateral vessel development in a rabbit ischemic hindlimb model.\nTen days after the ligation of the external iliac artery and excision of the common and superficial femoral arteries in one limb of New Zealand white rabbits, heparin (800 IU, n = 13), VEGF (1 mg, n = 3; 5 mg, n = 5), heparin (800 IU) + VEGF (1 mg, n = 5; 5 mg, n = 7), or saline solution (n = 8) was injected as a single bolus in a marginal ear vein. Collateral vessel formation and limb perfusion were assessed 10 and 30 days after treatment.\nAnimals in both VEGF-treated groups had a significantly higher (p < 0.01) increase in calf blood pressure ratio at day 10 (control, 0.44 +/- 0.02; heparin, 0.47 +/- 0.02; VEGF, 0.60 +/- 0.01; heparin+VEGF, 0.61 +/- 0.02) and day 30 (control, 0.49 +/- 0.05; heparin, 0.48 +/- 0.02; VEGF, 0.70 +/- 0.03; heparin+VEGF, 0.73 +/- 0.03). Both VEGF-treated groups had a significantly higher (p < 0.05) angiographic score at day 30 (control, 0.28 +/- 0.01; heparin, 0.28 +/- 0.01; VEGF, 0.37 +/- 0.01; heparin+VEGF, 0.38 +/- 0.02). Maximum flow reserve at day 30 in the ischemic limb was higher (p < 0.05) in VEGF-treated rabbits (control, 1.87 +/- 0.07; heparin, 1.92 +/- 0.08; VEGF, 2.42 +/- 0.16; heparin+VEGF, 2.33 +/- 0.12). Capillary density was higher (p < 0.01) in the ischemic muscles of VEGF-treated rabbits (control, 156 +/- 10/mm2; heparin, 178 +/- 8/mm2; VEGF, 230 +/- 10/mm2; heparin+VEGF, 233 +/- 8/mm2).\nThis series of in vivo experiments demonstrates that intravenous administration of VEGF, with or without heparin, results in both anatomic and physiologic evidence of enhanced collateral vessel formation in the rabbit ischemic hindlimb. Single-bolus systemic administration of VEGF may be a feasible therapeutic strategy in patients with lower-extremity ischemia.",

The aneurysm was repaired through a thoracoabdominal approach with a Dacron aortic graft sewn end to end to the thoracic aorta and end to side to the infrarenal aorta. Perfusion was restored after oversewing the abdominal aorta above the superior mesenteric artery and oversewing the celiac trunk. After reperfusion the foregut remained critically ischemic despite a patent superior mesenteric artery. Foregut reperfusion was achieved by removing the spleen and anastomosing the distal splenic artery to the aortic graft. Recovery was complicated by infarction of the body of the pancreas because of cholesterol emboli, resulting in a large pleural effusion. After undergoing a subtotal pancreatectomy that preserved the splenic artery, the patient recovered without additional complications. During 8 years of follow-up, the patient has normoglycemia and has had no further infections complications. The distal splenic artery offers an excellent inflow for foregut revascularization; however, the pancreas is intolerant of atheromatous emboli.",

    "abstract": "True aneurysm of the subclavian artery is extremely rare. Excluding the more common aneurysms of an aberrant right subclavian artery, those associated with thoracic outlet syndrome, and posttraumatic \"aneurysms,\" atherosclerosis is the most common cause. Syphilis, tuberculosis, and cystic medial necrosis are less often the cause. These aneurysms can rupture, thrombose, embolize, or cause symptoms by local compression. Surgical treatment is generally indicated, and has evolved from ligation procedures to extirpation or endoaneurysmorrhaphy to the present practice of resection with revascularization. A case of a surgically treated, asymptomatic, atherosclerotic aneurysm of the intrathoracic left subclavian artery is presented, with a review of the English-language literature on the subject.",

In this study, the effect of hirulog on reducing deposition of indium 111-labeled platelets was assessed in a surgical model of aspirin-treated rats undergoing carotid endarterectomy.\nAnimals were randomly assigned to one of five groups: control (no aspirin or hirulog); aspirin alone (10 mg/kg); aspirin plus low-dose hirulog (0.2 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hr); aspirin plus medium-dose hirulog (0.4 mg/kg bolus followed by 1.0 mg/kg/hr); or aspirin plus high-dose hirulog (0.6 mg/kg bolus followed by 1.5 mg/kg/hr). Hirulog was infused before surgery and continued until termination of the experiment 30 minutes after endarterectomy.\nPlatelet deposition in rats receiving aspirin alone was reduced by 19% +/- 23% SE (p = 0.26) compared with controls. Deposition in aspirin-treated groups receiving low-, medium-, and high-dose hirulog decreased in a dose-dependent manner by 37% +/- 20% (p = 0.048), 44% +/- 19% (p = 0.061), and 56% +/- 13% (p = 0.022), respectively. As the dose of hirulog was increased, the plasma hirulog levels and activated partial thromboplastin time ratios (final:initial) also increased in a dose-dependent manner. The mean plasma hirulog levels ranged from 0.74 +/- 0.08 micrograms/ml in the low-dose hirulog group to 2.55 +/- 0.08 micrograms/ml in the high-dose hirulog group, and the corresponding activated partial thromboplastin time ratios were 1.5 +/- 0.12 (p = 0.001) and 3.3 +/- 0.63 (p = 0.001). Bleeding was easily controlled by local hemostatic measures for all experimental groups.\nHirulog causes significant decrease in 111In-labeled platelet deposition in aspirin-treated rats subjected to microsurgical endarterectomy at doses that allow surgical hemostasis to be easily established.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between admission and postoperative platelet count (PC) and mortality and morbidity rates after emergency surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nWe performed a case record review of 65 consecutive patients admitted with ruptured AAA.\nFive patients did not undergo operation because of poor clinical condition, 12 patients died at operation, 13 patients died after operation, and 35 patients survived (operative mortality rate of 58%). Fifteen patients had an admission PC of less than 150 x 10(9)/L, of whom 14 (93%) died; 27 patients had an admission PC of 150 to 250 x 10(9)/L, of whom 8 (30%) died; and 18 patients had an admission PC of greater than 250 x 10(9)/L of whom 3 (17%) died. At the end of operation 29 patients had a PC of less than 100 x 10(9)/L, of whom 13 (45%) died, 20 (69%) had development of multiorgan failure (MOF), and 6 (21%) required relaparotomy for bleeding complications. By contrast, all 19 patients having a PC of 100 x 10(9)/L or greater at the end of the operation survived, three (16%) had development of MOF, and none required further surgery for bleeding. There was a significant inverse correlation between PC at the end of the operation and the number of postoperative days spent on a ventilator, in the intensive therapy unit, and in hospital. After operation, 15 patients had development of thrombocytosis (PC > 400 x 10(9)/L), of whom 10 had development of deep venous thrombosis and 8 had development of pulmonary embolism. There were no deep venous thromboses or pulmonary embolisms in patients who did not have development of a postoperative thrombocytosis.\nThere is a direct correlation between PC on admission to the hospital and death after emergency repair of ruptured AAA. Thrombocytopenia at the end of the operation is associated with a high risk of morbidity from continuing hemorrhage or MOF. The development of postoperative thrombocytosis is associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications. PC provides a simple marker of outcome in patients diagnosed with and undergoing operation for ruptured AAA.",

By contrast, all 19 patients having a PC of 100 x 10(9)/L or greater at the end of the operation survived, three (16%) had development of MOF, and none required further surgery for bleeding. There was a significant inverse correlation between PC at the end of the operation and the number of postoperative days spent on a ventilator, in the intensive therapy unit, and in hospital. After operation, 15 patients had development of thrombocytosis (PC > 400 x 10(9)/L), of whom 10 had development of deep venous thrombosis and 8 had development of pulmonary embolism. There were no deep venous thromboses or pulmonary embolisms in patients who did not have development of a postoperative thrombocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Although standard heparin has been demonstrated to reduce endothelial cell dysfunction in acute ischemia-reperfusion injury, its mechanism of action remains unknown. We hypothesized that heparin's salutary endothelial effects are independent of its conventional anticoagulant activity and are not caused by nonspecific polyanion effects.\nIsolated rat hindlimbs were perfused at constant pressure with an albumin-enriched crystalloid buffer. After 60 minutes of normothermic ischemia, endothelial function was assessed by measurement of endothelial-dependent vasodilation by log increment infusion of acetylcholine. Endothelial-independent vasodilation was measured by exposure to nitroprusside. Some groups were pretreated with heparinoids possessing minimal or intermediate anticoagulant activity.\nTreatment with heparinoids with low anticoagulant activity significantly increased endothelial-dependent vasodilation when compared with the nontreated ischemic group and were statistically indistinguishable from the nonischemic control. Treatment with dextran sulfate, a randomly sulfated polymer with size and charge characteristics similar to heparin, did not change postischemic vasodilation. Endothelial-independent vasodilation was largely unaffected by ischemia-reperfusion or drug treatment.\nA heparinoid with negligible antithrombin-binding activity (Astenose) attenuated postischemic endothelial dysfunction, suggesting that its mechanism of action was independent of anticoagulant activity. Failure of dextran sulfate to be protective implied that the effect was not caused by nonspecific polyanion action.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rate of resolution of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the leg, by means of duplex imaging, in patients with symptoms during a 6-month period after initial diagnosis.\nSeventy-three limbs in 69 patients with acute DVT diagnosed by duplex imaging received conventional heparin and warfarin treatment and underwent subsequent duplex studies 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the initial diagnosis. The objectives of the study were to document (1) the rate or complete resolution of DVT, (2) the proportion of unstable, floating thrombi, and (3) the development of chronic damage as a result of vessel wall scarring.\nThe rate of normalization of DVT 6 months after diagnosis was 78% in the common femoral vein, 70% in the superficial femoral vein, 75% in the popliteal vein, and 70% in the calf veins examined at the scheduled intervals. Twenty-six percent of thrombi were considered unstable on the baseline examination. The average number of days necessary for these thrombi to become stable was 10.7 days. Damage to the vessel wall or valves was documented in 44% of the patients.\nRates of resolution of DVT were similar for the different veins of the leg studied. There was a high proportion of unstable thrombi, which present a high potential risk of embolization. Serial duplex scanning after DVT renders important information with regard to thrombus resolution, propagation, and attachment to the vein wall.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to study the influence of the anastomosis angle on the flow fields at end-to-side anastomoses in vivo.\nPolyurethane grafts of similar internal diameter to that of the abdominal aorta (8 mm) were implanted from the suprarenal to the infrarenal level in 10 pigs. Three angles of standardized distal end-to-side anastomoses (90 degrees, 45 degrees, and 15 degrees) were studied. The anatomic position of the anastomoses was constant, the proximal outflow segment was occluded, and the flow rate through the graft was controlled. Flow visualization was accomplished by a color-flow Doppler ultrasound system.\nThe angulation was reproduced within 10%. Gross hemodynamic parameters were stable, and the similarity parameters were typical for peripheral bypasses (mean Reynold's number is 424 and Womersley's parameter is 5.9). The flow fields were clearly dependent on the anastomosis angle. A zone of recirculation (approximately 5% of the flow area), extending from the toe to one diameter downstream, was found in the 45-degree and 90-degree anastomoses. No flow disturbances were detected at the toe and one diameter downstream with an anastomosis angle of 15 degrees. At the heel different recirculating flow patterns were found in the different anastomoses.\nThe anastomosis angle does change the flow fields at vascular end-to-side anastomoses in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, has been shown to have a salutary effect on ischemia and reperfusion injury in skeletal muscle, skin, and intestines. Because L-arginine also increases renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and urine flow in experimental animals with normal renal function, we postulated that L-arginine may also improve renal function after renal ischemic injury.\nEighteen adult New Zealand white rabbits weighing 3 to 3.5 kg were subjected to bilateral normothermic renal ischemia by clamping both renal pedicles for 1 hour followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. The animals were randomized into three groups: group I (control, n = 6) received no additional treatment; group II (pretreatment, n = 6) received systemic intravenous L-arginine at 150 mg/kg over 20 minutes before induction of ischemia; group III (posttreatment, n = 6) received systemic intravenous L-arginine at 150 mg/kg over 20 minutes from the onset of reperfusion. Urine flow, creatinine clearance (CCR), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and renal failure index (RFI) were calculated before ischemia and 2 hours after reperfusion, by use of standard formulas. The changes of the various renal parameters were compared among the three groups.\nBilateral normothermic renal ischemia for 1 hour produced a significant deterioration of glomerular filtration as evidenced by a CCR decrease from 11.1 +/- 1.8 to 2.49 +/- 0.9 ml/min (p < 0.01), FENa increase from 2.9% +/- 1.0% to 20.8% +/- 1.5% (p < 0.01) and RFI increase from 4.0 +/- 1.3 to 28.8 +/- 2.6 (p < 0.01). Pretreatment with L-arginine (group II) minimized the deleterious effects caused by ischemia on glomerular filtration (CCR of 2.49 +/- 0.9 ml/min in group I vs 4.95 +/- 2.5 ml/min in group II, p < 0.05) and tubular function (FENa of 20.8% +/- 1.5% in group I vs 13.0% +/- 5.6% in group II and RFI of 28.8 +/- 2.6 in group I vs 18.6 +/- 8.0 in group II, p < 0.05). Infusion of L-arginine at the onset of reperfusion (group III) produced a significant diuretic effect (urine flow from 32.6 +/- 13.4 ml/hr in group I to 63.3 +/- 18.8 ml/hr in group III, p < 0.05) and also minimized glomerular damage (CCR from 2.49 +/- 0.9 ml/min in group I to 4.80 +/- 1.2 ml/min in group III, p < 0.05); however, no beneficial effect was observed on tubular function.\nInduction of nitric oxide production by systemic L-arginine infusion can best preserve glomerular and tubular function in the ischemic/reperfused kidney when given before the ischemic insult.",

Data reflecting patient characteristics, severity of heart disease, comorbidity, and in-hospital mortality rates were collected prospectively; the presence of clinical and subclinical indicators of PVD was determined retrospectively.\nObserved in-hospital mortality rates with CABG were 2.4-fold higher in the 796 patients with indicators of PVD (7.7%) than in the 2207 patients without PVD (3.2%) (crude odds ratio [OR] 2.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73-3.37]). After adjusting for their higher comorbidity scores, more advanced heart disease, and age, patients with PVD remained 73% more likely to die in hospital after CABG (adjusted OR 1.73 [CI 1.19-2.51]). The excess risk of in-hospital death associated with PVD was attributable largely to lower extremity occlusive disease (adjusted OR 2.03 [CI 1.34-3.07]). Subclinical lower extremity occlusive disease (asymptomatic absence of pedal pulses) had the same effect as clinically overt disease. Cerebrovascular disease had a small and statistically nonsignificant effect on CABG-related deaths (adjusted OR 1.13 [CI 0.73-1.74]). Excess mortality rates in patients with PVD were primarily due to increased risk of death from heart failure and dysrhythmias, but not to cerebrovascular accidents or peripheral arterial complications.\nThe presence of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease is an important, independent predictor of in-hospital mortality rates for patients undergoing CABG. Controlled studies of the long-term effects of CABG in patients with PVD are needed to determine the optimal role of myocardial revascularization in this population.",

    "abstract": "This study reviews the contemporary surgical outcome of 69 patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent one or more aortic operations between July 18, 1989, and April 14, 1994.\nDuring this 5-year period, 79 operations were performed including composite valve graft replacement (n = 28) and graft replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta (n = 29). Fifty-seven additional operations had been performed before referral, for a total of 136 aortic operations in this group. Forty-two patients (60.9%) required multiple operations; 16 patients (23.2%) underwent three or more procedures.\nFollow-up was complete on all patients. The 30-day and long-term survival rates were 98.7% and 96.2%, respectively. Distal aortic replacement resulted in paraparesis in only one (2.6%) of 38 patients; no patient had development of paraplegia. No patient had a stroke after the use of profound hypothermic circulatory arrest.\nAortic surgery prolongs survival in patients with Marfan syndrome and currently has low associated morbidity and mortality rates. Treatment often requires multiple staged operations. The variety and multiplicity of aortic manifestations in these patients demonstrate the necessity for lifelong cardiovascular surveillance to detect new or recurrent disease.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic disease appears to be more severe in black patients than in white patients, but abdominal aortic aneurysms, which have traditionally been believed to have an atherosclerotic cause, are reported to be less common in black patients than in white patients. Our goals were to compare and contrast factors associated with the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms and clinically significant atherosclerotic occlusive disease (1) to determine whether these diseases share a common cause and (2) to explore their association with race.\nDual case-control studies were conducted with multivariate analysis to compare cases (patients undergoing aneurysmectomy or patients undergoing femoral bypass) with a comparison group consisting of patients who had undergone appendectomy. Two data sources were used: (1) hospital discharge data for Massachusetts from 1984 through 1988 and (2) medical records at University Hospital of Boston and Boston City Hospital. For both the Massachusetts database and the hospital chart review, records were obtained for all patients discharged between January 1984 and December 1988 with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure code for abdominal aortic aneurysm resection (38.44) or aneurysmorrhaphy (38.34) or with a procedure code for femoral artery bypass/reconstruction (39.29). To conduct a nested case-control study, records were also obtained for a control group consisting of patients between the ages of 50 and 84 years who had undergone appendectomy during the same 5-year period.\nBlack patients had higher rates of femoral bypass than did white patients after adjustment for age and sex (odds ratio = 1.97; 95% confidence interval: 1.49, 2.61; p < 0.0001). However, femoral bypass was also associated with hypertension, diabetes, and low household income. After adjusting for these additional factors in the statewide data set, the black/white odds ratio for femoral bypass was only 1.44 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.92). The parallel case-control study at University Hospital and Boston City Hospital, which provided information about smoking status and more accurate ascertainment of coexisting hypertension and diabetes, indicated that there was no racial difference in rates of femoral bypass after correcting for these additional risk factors (odds ratio = 0.94; 95% confidence interval: 0.40, 2.22; p = 0.90). In contrast, abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy occurred predominantly in white men. Aneurysmectomy was also associated with smoking and hypertension, but aneurysmectomy was not significantly associated with diabetes mellitus or family income. The black/white odds ratio for aneurysm was 0.29; (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 1.23; p = 0.09 after adjustment for other variables).\nHypertension, smoking, and male sex are risk factors for the development of femoral atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. However, abdominal aortic aneurysms occur predominantly in white men and do not appear to be associated with diabetes mellitus or income. In contrast, the higher rate of femoral artery bypass in black patients is probably the result of greater prevalence among black patients of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and perhaps by other ill-defined factors associated with socioeconomic status.",

    "abstract": "Restenosis of arteries or bypass grafts after vascular reconstruction is a common clinical entity that significantly limits long-term patency. This process, termed intimal hyperplasia (IH), is characterized by smooth muscle cell proliferation in the intima and subsequent accumulation of intercellular matrix. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that endothelial cell (EC) seeding of acutely injured arteries accelerates reendothelialization of the flow surface and limits the development of IH.\nECs were harvested from jugular veins of New Zealand white rabbits (n = 13) and were amplified in tissue culture. Each animal subsequently underwent bilateral balloon catheter injury of the iliofemoral arteries; one side was immediately seeded with cultured autologous ECs at supraconfluent density, whereas the contralateral vessel served as a nonseeded control. Animals were killed 33 +/- 5 days after balloon injury. Intimal thickening was quantitated on histologic sections of vessels (three sections per vessel, total of 60 sections) and percent endothelialization was assessed by SEM; measurements were obtained by use of computer-aided morphometry performed by a blinded observer. Data were analyzed by use of a paired t test for comparison between seeded and control vessels.\nSeeded vessels exhibited a greater degree of reendothelialization (93.9% +/- 7.6% of the surface) than their unseeded counterparts (65.1% +/- 22.5%, p < 0.01). Intimal cross-sectional area and the ratio of intimal area to medial area were not significantly different between seeded and control vessels (intima: 0.32 +/- 0.19 vs 0.37 +/- 0.11 mm2, p = 0.28; intimal area to medial area ratio: 0.84 +/- 0.35 vs 1.02 +/- 0.2, p = 0.24).\nWe conclude that seeding with autologous venous ECs accelerated restoration of the endothelial monolayer but failed to attenuate IH in balloon-injured rabbit arteries. Further studies are necessary to determine the functional properties of seeded endothelium and to examine the effect of EC seeding on intimal thickening in other clinically relevant models.",

    "abstract": "The use of autogenous vein, whether in situ or excised, for arterial bypass procedures is well accepted. However, this usually requires the presence of a length of good-quality vein of adequate diameter. In patients lacking sufficient length of vein, two or more pieces of vein may be spliced together to complete the reconstruction. The effect of vein splicing on vein bypass patency is not well studied.\nOver a 14-year period, 1956 lower extremity revascularizations were performed with a single autogenous vein, 1806 in situ and 150 excised veins. During the same time, 184 bypasses required splicing vein segments together, of which 111 were in situ bypass procedures, which required splicing of one or more pieces of excised vein to complete the reconstruction (partial in situ bypass). Seventy-three bypasses were completed with multiple pieces of spliced excised vein. The source for the excised, spliced vein segments was the distal ipsilateral greater saphenous vein (GSV) in 40%, accessory ipsilateral GSV in 8%, contralateral GSV in 13%, lesser saphenous vein in 28%, and arm vein in 11%.\nThe 1- and 4-year primary patency rates for the entire spliced vein group were 72% and 45%, with secondary patency rates of 79% and 61%. The 1- and 4-year secondary patency rates of partial in situ bypasses were 80% and 70%, compared with 91% and 83% for in situ bypasses completed without a spliced segment (p < 0.0001). The 1- and 4-year secondary patency rates were 78% and 67% in the spliced excised vein group and 85% and 75% in the single excised vein group (p = not significant). The 4-year limb salvage rates were as follows: in situ (96%), partial in situ (85%), single excised vein (95%), and spliced excised vein (90%).\nWe conclude that the use of excised vein segments to complete partial in situ bypasses may be associated with a decrement of bypass patency. Use of spliced excised vein segments of good quality for arterial bypass can produce acceptable patency rates. Such spliced autogenous conduits are clearly preferable to prosthetic bypasses for infrageniculate arterial reconstructions. Meticulous technique is a prerequisite for the successful performance of vein-to-vein anastomoses.",

    "abstract": "Adverse outcomes apparently associated with hypothermia led us to examine patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs to test the hypothesis that hypothermia (temperature less than 34.5 degrees C) is associated with increased morbidity and excess mortality rates.\nTwo hundred sixty-two elective AAA repairs were retrospectively reviewed for preoperative and intraoperative risk factors. Core temperature, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and APACHE III scores (raw and temperature-adjusted), fluid resuscitation, and perioperative organ dysfunction were recorded prospectively. Outcome measures included lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, and hospital mortality rates.\nExcept for a higher risk of hypothermia in women (p < 0.05), by univariate analysis, preoperative risk factors were similar in patients in the hypothermic and normothermic groups. After operation, patients with hypothermia had significantly greater APACHE scores (p < 0.0001), and patients in the hypothermic nonsurvivor group took significantly longer to rewarm (p < 0.05), suggesting marked hypoperfusion. Patients with hypothermia had significantly greater fluid (p < 0.05), transfusion (p < 0.01), vasopressor (p < 0.05), and inotrope (p < 0.05) requirements, resulting in significantly higher incidences of organ dysfunction (53.0% vs 28.7%, p < 0.01) and death (12.1% vs 1.5%, p < 0.01) and markedly prolonged lengths of stay in the unit (9.2 +/- 2.0 vs 5.3 +/- 0.6, p < 0.05) and in the hospital (24.3 +/- 2.9 vs 15.0 +/- 0.08, p < 0.01). By multivariate analysis, female gender (p = 0.004) was the only predictor of intraoperative hypothermia, whereas initial hypothermia was significantly predictive of both prolonged hypothermia and development of organ failure (p < 0.05). Organ failure (p < 0.05) and acute myocardial infarction (p < 0.01) were independent predictors of death.\nAfter AAA repair, patients with hypothermia have multiple physiologic derangements associated with adverse outcomes. Although multiple etiologic factors are interacting, body temperature is one variable that should be controlled during aortic surgery.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to present a 20-year experience with a single method of passive distal perfusion during descending thoracic aortic aneurysm resection.\nAortic repair with a Dacron graft interposition was performed for 366 consecutive aneurysms located between the left subclavian artery and the crux of the diaphragm. The extent of aorta resected in 335 patients (91.5%) represented one third or less of the aortic length. A 9 mm Gott shunt was cannulated proximally into the ascending aorta (235 cases), the aortic arch (60 cases), the descending aorta (68 cases), or the left ventricle (3 cases) and inserted distally into the descending aorta (232 cases), the femoral artery (127 cases), or the abdominal aorta (7 cases). Shunt flows were recorded in 91 cases and varied from 1100 ml to 4900 ml/min, (mean 2526 ml/min). Distal pressure during shunting was measured in 62 patients. It varied from 15 to 120 mm Hg (mean 64.5 mm Hg). The aortic cross-clamp time varied from 8 to 124 minutes (mean 30 minutes).\nThe hospital death rate was 12% overall and 9.9% (35/351) if ruptured aneurysms are excluded. Among 359 operating room survivors, neither immediate nor delayed ischemic spinal cord deficit occurred. Transient renal dysfunction occurred in nine patients (2.4%) and kidney failure in one (0.2%). Five deaths (1.3%) were shunt related.\nDistal perfusion with the 9 mm Gott shunt has proven to be an effective method to preserve spinal cord function. The limited extent of aorta resected and the brief aortic cross-clamp time may also be interactive factors of protection.",

    "abstract": "Although the technical feasibility of pedal artery bypass for limb salvage is now well established, questions remain about its most appropriate use and its long-term durability.\nWe reviewed our experience over an 8-year period in 367 consecutive patients undergoing 384 vein bypass grafts to the dorsalis pedis for limb salvage.\nNinety-five percent of the patients had diabetes mellitus. Infection complicated ischemia at initial presentation in 55.2% of patients. The preoperative arteriogram demonstrated a patent dorsalis pedis in 362 extremities (92.8%). Four hundred two patients underwent exploration for bypass, including 29 patients without demonstrated arteries on the arteriogram but audible pedal Doppler signals. Successful bypasses were carried out in 357 of 362 cases, where preoperative arteriography demonstrated a patent dorsalis pedis artery (98.6%), 16 of 28 cases explored on the basis of a Doppler signal alone (57%), and 11 of 12 patients where angiographic status was unknown. All procedures were performed with vein: in situ 38.5%, reversed 29%, nonreversed 18%, arm vein 7%, and composite vein 8%. Inflow was taken from the common femoral artery in 34%, superficial femoral or popliteal arteries in 60%, a previously placed graft in 5%, and a tibial artery in 1%. There were seven perioperative deaths (1.8%) and 21 myocardial infarctions (5.4%). Twenty-nine grafts failed within 30 days (7.5%), but 19 were successfully revised. Eight of the 10 failed grafts resulted in major amputation (80%). Over the remaining study period, there were 39 additional graft failures, of which 17 were successfully revised, and 17 additional major amputations. Actuarial primary and secondary patency and limb salvage rates were 68%, 82%, and 87%, respectively, at 5 years' followup. The actuarial patients survival rate was 57% at 5 years. Patency rates were similar for in situ and translocated saphenous vein grafts.\nDorsalis pedis arterial bypass is an effective limb salvage procedure with long-term durability comparable to distal vein grafts placed into more proximal arteries.",

    "abstract": "This study compares the utility of cineangiography and real-time intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) in achieving successful deployment of endovascular prostheses.\nFive types of 5 cm long, 8 mm internal diameter polyester vascular grafts were secured in the infrarenal aorta of mongrel dogs by 18 mm long Palmaz balloon expandable vascular stents sutured to each end of the prostheses. The endovascular prostheses were delivered by crimping the stents at the ends of the grafts onto a 10 mm outside diameter, 8 cm long polyethylene balloon-dilation catheter. Real-time IVUS of the procedure was provided by a 0.035-inch, 20 MHz imaging element passed through the guide wire lumen in the balloon catheter. Two prostheses of each type were implanted, with one removed at 30 days and the other at 60 days for analysis.\nAt implantation, both angiography and IVUS provided information regarding the choice of site for placement of the device and sizing of the aortic lumen. Real-time IVUS enhanced the information obtained by cineangiography by displaying tomographic views of the vessel anatomy, enabling determination of cross-sectional areas, assessing full stent expansion, and providing information regarding surface topography along the length of the prostheses. Several critical observations were apparent only on IVUS, including incomplete initial stent expansion during two procedures evidenced by pulsation of the aortic wall independent of the stent and movement of unstented segments of thin-walled grafts. Some of these observations led to further interventions at the time of deployment. At death, a comparison of cineangiography, IVUS, and ultrafast computed tomography outlined lumenal continuity and areas of irregularity, thrombus, or narrowing, with IVUS being more sensitive than cineangiography or computed tomography for determining most parameters.\nWe conclude that IVUS is a promising alternative method for precise placement of intravascular grafts.",

    "abstract": "A 32-year-old man with progressive dyspnea and congenital lymphedema was transferred to our hospital for evaluation as a lung transplant candidate with the suspected diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension. Evaluation revealed the additional history of previous limb-shortening procedures for the left leg, the presence of syndactyly, long-standing bilateral (left to right) lower extremity varices, as well as soft tissue asymmetry with the left leg and arm larger than the right-sided counterparts. A diagnosis of Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome was made on the basis of these findings. Because of the deep venous malformations known to occur in this syndrome, we sought evidence of recurrent pulmonary emboli as an explanation for the patient's progressive dyspnea, despite negative pulmonary arteriography and ventilation-perfusion scanning results at another institution. Repeat pulmonary arteriography demonstrated evidence of chronic and subacute pulmonary emboli. The patient is presently being treated with warfarin anticoagulation, with plans for placement of a caval filter if anticoagulation alone is insufficient to prevent further embolism. Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome is a rare cause of chronic pulmonary emboli, and this entity should be considered when the characteristic historical and physical findings are present. A case report and review of the syndrome, with particular focus on the aspects relevant to the vascular surgeon, are presented.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of gadolinum-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for defining anatomic features relevant to performing aortic surgery for aneurysmal disease.\nAnatomic data defined by MRA, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) size and character, as well as the status of the celiac, mesenteric, renal, and iliac arteries, were correlated with angiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or operative data in 43 patients. Five MRA sequences were obtained in an hour-long examination optimized for aortoiliac, splanchnic, and renal artery imaging at 1.5 T in a body coil. Four of the sequences were performed during or after infusion of gadolinium to improve image quality.\nMRA correctly defined the maximum aneurysm diameter, as well as its proximal and distal extent in all patients. MRA detected 33 of 35 significant stenoses among 153 splanchnic, renal, or iliac branches examined (sensitivity = 94% and specificity = 98%). MRA did not resolve the degree of aortic branch stenotic disease sufficiently to precisely grade its severity. MRA did not reliably define the status of the inferior mesenteric artery, lumbar arteries or internal iliac arteries. One ruptured AAA and one inflammatory AAA were correctly diagnosed by MRA. No patient had a contrast reaction or contrast-induced renal toxicity related to administration of gadolinium.\nGadolinium-enhanced MRA of AAA provides appropriate, essential anatomic information for aortic reconstructive surgery in a 1-hour examination devoid of contrast-related renal toxicity or catheterization-related complications attending conventional arteriography.",

As in the initial document, reporting standards for publications dealing with (1) acute lower extremity venous thrombosis, (2) chronic lower extremity venous insufficiency, (3) upper extremity venous thrombosis, and (4) pulmonary embolism are presented. Numeric grading schemes for disease severity, risk factors, and outcome criteria present in the original document have been updated to reflect increased knowledge of venous disease and advances in diagnostic techniques. Certain recommendations of necessity remain arbitrary. These standards are offered as guidelines whose observance will in our opinion improve the clarity and precision of communications in the field of venous disorders.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to prospectively study analyses outcome after staple exclusion of abdominal aneurysms with specific follow-up of the excluded aneurysm. Whether these data may predict behavior of aneurysms excluded from the circulation by transluminal grafting procedures is also addressed.\nStaple exclusion of abdominal aneurysms with bypass via retroperitoneal incisions was performed in 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective procedures. Risk factors, clamp time, operative time, transfusions, length of stay, complications, platelets, fibrinogen, and fibrin split products were documented. Duplex imaging was performed quarterly for 1 year after exclusion and at least annually thereafter. Serial measurements of aneurysm size and evaluation for thrombosis was obtained.\nAneurysm size averaged 5.5 cm. Risk factors included history of smoking (54%), history of heart disease (51%), hypertension (41%), hyperlipidemia (34%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). Clamp time averaged 51 minutes. Forty-eight required no intraoperative transfusion, and 19 needed only autologous blood; the average 24-hour transfusion was 313 cc. Length of stay averaged 11 days, with a median of 8 days, and correlated with age, aneurysm size, and risk factors. The 30-day mortality rate was 4%. Death was associated with longer operative and anesthesia times and with age and risk factors. As calculated by life-table analysis to 5 years, 96.8% of aneurysms thrombosed. No aneurysm expanded, became symptomatic, nor ruptured. Perioperative platelet, fibrinogen, and fibrin split product assays show no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation or consumptive coagulopathy.\nStaple exclusion and bypass of abdominal aneurysms as described in this study is safe and effective. There has been neither aneurysm expansion nor rupture, and the technique reliably leads to thrombosis of aneurysms without coagulopathy.",

    "abstract": "Most reports regarding infrainguinal bypass surgical procedures demonstrate benefits well but pay less attention to adverse outcomes and consequences of failure for the patient. For a wider scope of infrainguinal bypass surgical procedures, we evaluated patient-oriented outcomes of limb loss occurring after failed infrainguinal bypass operations.\nEighty-one patients with vascular amputations were identified in a retrospective study. Follow-up was complete with a mean of 3.6 years. Life-table and multivariate analyses were used to assess factors influencing the desired outcome goals of rehabilitation. Mortality rates, social function, risk of contralateral amputation, and the ability to walk were used to measure the late outcome.\nThe long-term survival rate was poor (72% at 1 year; 53% at 3 years) and was not related to traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Moreover the risk for contralateral amputation was 10% per year. One year after amputation 81% (47 of 58) of the surviving amputees were walking independently, and 73% (42 of 58) were living at home, 32 with their spouse. At 3 years these results were 73% (27 of 37) and 78% (29 of 37), respectively. In addition, the level of self-care changed significantly (p < 0.001) after amputation. Advanced age (older than 65 years), self-care performance, and living with someone were important predictors of late outcome.\nIt is possible for a high percentage of patients with vascular amputations to return home successfully, either walking or in a wheelchair. Moreover this result can be predicted based on preoperative clinical variables. These data may be helpful to guide fitting of prosthetic devices, planning of discharge home, and use of health care resources.",

This study compares results in 776 limbs with primary uncomplicated varicose veins with those in 166 limbs with the complications of lipodermatosclerosis or past venous ulceration.\nDuplex scanning determined whether superficial and deep veins were occluded or showed reflux and whether outward flow occurred in medial calf perforators with calf muscle contraction.\nTwo proximal deep veins were occluded. When limbs with primary uncomplicated varicose veins, lipodermatosclerosis, or past ulceration were compared, superficial reflux alone was seen in 55%, 39%, and 38%, deep reflux alone was seen in 2%, 7%, and 8%, and combined superficial and deep reflux was seen in 18%, 34%, and 48%, respectively. Superficial reflux affected the long saphenous system alone in 58%, 57%, and 40%, the short saphenous system alone in 18%, 18%, and 26%, and both the long and short saphenous systems in 24%, 25%, and 34%, respectively. Limbs with ulceration more frequently showed superficial reflux (p < 0.05), and all limbs with complications more frequently showed short saphenous reflux (p < 0.05) and deep reflux (p < 0.01) specifically in the posterior tibial veins (p < 0.01). Outward flow was seen in medial calf perforators in 57%, 67%, and 66%, respectively; it occurred more frequently in all limbs with complications (p < 0.05). Isolated outward flow in perforators without superficial or deep reflux was seen in 10%, 10%, and 2%, respectively.\nMost limbs with complications had superficial reflux either alone or combined with deep reflux, and few had deep reflux alone. Reflux was more frequent in posterior tibial veins for limbs with complications compared with those with uncomplicated primary varicose veins. Outward flow in perforators was common in limbs with complications and with uncomplicated primary varicose veins, but isolated outward flow in perforators was uncommon. Treatment directed to the superficial veins alone may be sufficient for most patients with complications.",

    "abstract": "The performance of a graft created from the upper arm basilic and cephalic veins in continuity was investigated.\nRetrospective analysis of 50 patients, who underwent 54 distal reconstructions with an upper arm vein loop graft between February 1989 and October 1993 (male-to-female ratio of 30/20; mean age of 69.2 years, range 39 to 87; 74% had diabetes) was undertaken. Vein grafts were harvested through a near continuous incision, leaving a skin bridge in the cubita. Intraoperative angioscopy was used to exclude endoluminal disease and to directly observe valvulotomy of the nonreversed part of the graft.\nOperations were performed for limb salvage in 98.2% of 17 primary and 37 reoperative procedures. Eleven femoropopliteal, 33 femorotibial-pedal, seven popliteal-distal, and two outflow jump grafts were performed. The ipsilateral saphenous vein was unavailable because of previous infrainguinal bypass in 35, coronary artery bypass grafting in 14, and unsuitable quality in 5 cases. Thirty-eight grafts were used in continuity, and 16 grafts required repair or splicing with additional vein segments. Primary 30-day patency rate was 92.6% (n = 4 occlusions). No operative deaths occurred. The cumulative patency rate at 1 year was 74.4%, the limb salvage rate 90.7%.\nThe upper arm vein loop is a durable graft with excellent short-term and midterm patency rates. Sufficient vein length can be obtained to reach the below-knee and midtibial levels. Angioscopic quality assessment is a valuable adjunct to exclude endoluminal disease most commonly occurring in the median cubital vein. Straightening the curve of the median cubital vein and valvulotomy do not influence patency rates. This is a valuable technique for vascular surgeons that enables rescue of ischemic limbs under otherwise difficult circumstances.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the results of vascular interventions for impotence in men with this complaint.\nBetween September 1983 and March 1993, 1094 men with the chief complaint of impotence (average age 54.5 years) were screened by use of penile plethysmography and penile brachial indexes: 635 were considered to have normal flow, and 459 were considered to have abnormal arterial flow, 12.2% of whom were found to have aortoiliac disease. Based on negative neural screening results, absence of erectile responses on increasing doses of intracavernously injected papaverine or prostaglandin E1 (ICI), surgical candidates for microvascular procedures were referred for dynamic infusion cavernosography (DICC) and pudendal arteriography. Operations for men discovered to have aortoiliac disease were based on conventional indications including aneurysm size or limb ischemia. None of the subjects had diabetes. Only those patients without diabetes and those not requiring blood pressure medications were selected for microvascular procedures. We report our experience and surgical outcomes at average follow-ups of 33 to 48 months. Four types of operations were performed on 67 men (age 18 to 79 years). These included 17 aortoiliac reconstructions, 11 dorsal penile artery bypasses, 12 dorsal vein arterializations, and 27 venous interruptions. Follow-up data were obtained by direct examination and noninvasive Doppler examinations; repeat arteriography (4 of 11); repeat DICC after venous ablation procedures (18 of 27) and postoperative ICI response. Mail questionnaires completed postoperative surveillance.\nAmong 17 men undergoing aortoiliac intervention for aneurysms in eight and occlusive disease in nine, 58% functioned spontaneously after operation and 18% used ICI or vacuum constrictor devices at an average follow-up time of 38 months. Among 11 men with dorsal penile artery bypasses, 27% functioned spontaneously and 45% used ICI at an average follow-up time of 34.5 months. Among 12 men with dorsal vein arterialization, 33% functioned spontaneously, and 47% used ICI at an average follow-up time of 48 months. Among 27 with venous interruption, 33% functioned spontaneously and 44% used ICI. In seven of eight aneurysms of 4.5 to 6.0 cm in size, impotence workup led to discovery; probable embolic mechanisms existed in three. Venous interruption efficacy correlated with postoperative DICC results when flow to maintain erection was 40 ml or less. Apart from two cases of glans hyperemia, no surgical complications occurred in the microvascular procedures. There was one episode of bleeding caused by DICC after aortic reconstruction. There were no deaths.\nWith prospective screening criteria, 6% to 7% of impotent men became candidates for vascular intervention. Including those functioning with ICI or vacuum constriction devices, about 70% of these men were functional after operation. Men undergoing aortoiliac reconstruction has a significantly higher rate (58%) of spontaneous function as compared with those undergoing microvascular procedures.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report our experience in the management of acute aortic occlusion and to analyze factors that influenced the outcome.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of 48 patients with acute aortic occlusion treated over a 19-year period. Presentation included limb ischemia in 34, acute abdomen in four, spinal cord compression-like symptoms in eight, and sudden onset of hypertension in two patients. Thrombosis was the cause of acute aortic occlusion in 44, and embolus in four patients. Acute thrombosis was associated with underlying atherosclerotic occlusive disease in 36 patients. In these, thrombosis was due to low-flow state caused by cardiac dysfunction or severe volume depletion. Thrombosed aneurysms caused aortic occlusion in two patients. Hypercoagulable state caused thrombosis of relatively normal aorta in six patients. Angiography in 39 patients revealed occlusion to be juxtarenal or infrarenal in 37 and suprarenal in two. Left ventricular function (LVF) was assessed in 42 patients. Circulation was restored in 45 (aortofemoral bypass in 22, axillofemoral bypass in 12, and thromboembolectomy in 11). This was not feasible in three patients. Additional surgical procedures were required in 29 patients (64%).\nThe overall mortality rate was 52% (25 of 48). Of the 20 patients with severely compromised LVF, 17 died (85%). In contrast, only five (23%) deaths occurred among 22 with good LVF. Among 29 patients who required additional operations, 18 died (62%). All four patients with embolic occlusion survived. Patients with normal LVF but hypercoagulable state had dismal outcome--only one of the six survived.\nAcute aortic occlusion is infrequent. Presentation may be varied, thus delaying diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is a proliferative process of vascular smooth muscle cells that occurs after an arterial injury, particularly at outflow anastomoses of prosthetic bypass grafts. IH causes stenosis that leads ultimately to graft flow reduction and thrombosis. We have demonstrated previously that vein cuff interposition between an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) graft and artery at distal anastomoses diminished IH formation in the arterial outflow as compared with noncuffed anastomoses. Improved long-term patency rates associated with the placement of an interposition vein cuff at the distal anastomosis of e-PTFE grafts to infrageniculate arteries have also been demonstrated clinically. This study examined the mechanical factors that may contribute to the protective effect of cuffed anastomoses. These factors include the expansibility of the vein cuff as compared with e-PTFE, as well as the angle of the cuffed anastomosis.\nCompatible animals were selected by use of platelet aggregation studies. Nine dogs, group A, received a 4 mm e-PTFE graft plus a 1 cm long interposition vein cuff at the distal anastomosis in the left carotid artery. The same procedure was done on the right side, and in addition the vein cuff was encircled by an e-PTFE jacket incorporated into the anastomosis to prevent the expansion of the vein cuff with arterial pulsation. To study the effect of distal anastomotic angle and geometry on the formation of IH, five dogs, group B, received a 4 mm e-PTFE graft in both sides. On the left, the distal anastomosis was performed between the graft and the artery at an acute angle as it is commonly done when a bypass graft is placed. On the right side a 1 cm long, 6 mm diameter e-PTFE segment was interposed between the artery and the graft at a perpendicular angle. This geometry mimicked the right angle of a vein cuff-to-artery anastomosis. After 10 weeks the grafts were harvested, and the thickness of IH was measured with an ocular micrometer under light microscopy.\nIn group A, one dog had bilateral graft thrombosis (12%), and these grafts were discarded. In the remaining eight dogs there was no statistically significant difference in the thickness of IH between the right (jacketed group) and the left side (nonjacketed/control group), showing that vein cuff expansibility did not play a role in protecting against the formation of IH. In group B, bilateral graft thrombosis occurred in four of five dogs (80%), suggesting that the perpendicular anastomotic angle was not protective.\nThese results suggested that the protective effect of the vein cuff is not mechanical in origin.",

The devices consist of either a Dacron or an autogenous vein graft sutured to a balloon-expandable stent. The stented grafts are placed through remote arteriotomies, advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to their predetermined sites, and secured into position.\nForty of the 50 endovascular stented graft procedures used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms or iliac aneurysms were considered successful, even though some secondary treatment was required in six patients (two open operations; four secondary endovascular procedures). The 10 failures include four early procedural deaths, one late procedural death, and five leaks. All five arteriovenous fistulas and the two false aneurysms were successfully treated with endovascular stented grafts.\nAlthough our experience with endovascular stented grafts has been promising, remaining problems require resolution, and further follow-up is needed.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to perform a preliminary histopathologic analysis of explanted human endovascular stented grafts from patients treated for occlusive disease.\nOver a 16-month period, 26 endovascular stented grafts were placed in 21 patients with limb-threatening ischemia caused by aortoiliac or femoral artery occlusive disease. All grafts were inserted through open arteriotomies remote from the region of primary disease. During the follow-up period, two patients died of preexisting heart disease 2 weeks and 7 months after grafting, and a portion of their endovascular grafts were the surrounding artery was explanted. Specimens from five other endovascular grafts were obtained during surgical revision for graft stenosis after 3 and 6 weeks and for outflow artery stenosis after 3, 5, and 6 months. All specimens were formalin fixed and studied with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome staining and immunohistochemically for factor VIII-related antigen, alpha actin smooth muscle, macrophage antigen (MAC-387) and PC-10 (a mouse monoclonal antibody which specifically recognizes proliferating cell nuclear antigen in paraffin sections).\nThree weeks after placement of the stented grafts, organizing thrombus was present on both surfaces of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. At 6 weeks, evidence of a neointima with overlying endothelium was seen in the perianastomotic region, and 3 months after grafting it was seen 1 to 3 cm from the anastomosis. The specimen explanted at 5 months demonstrated factor VIII-positive cells 8 cm from the anastomosis. The histopathologic condition of the external capsule appeared to vary, depending on the presence or absence of an external wrap on the PTFE graft and on which layer in the arterial wall the graft was inserted. A foreign body reaction characterized by multinucleated giant cells was seen adjacent to wrapped grafts or around those placed in an intraadventitial plane. Grafts inserted within the media were surrounded by orderly, arranged, smooth muscle cells and few mononuclear cells. Extensive smooth muscle cell proliferation (PC-10 activity) was not seen within native artery atherosclerotic plaques peripherally displaced and external to prosthetic endovascular grafts.\nThese preliminary observations on the healing of PTFE endovascular stented grafts in human beings demonstrate limited plaque hyperplasia and the presence of endothelial cells on the luminal surface remote from the graft-artery anastomosis. It is unclear whether this is a unique manifestation of healing in prosthetic grafts inserted within the walls of arteries.",

Tissue blocks were taken from representative areas along the entire length of the graft surface and evaluated by light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and immunocytochemical staining. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with smooth muscle cell alpha-actin, which demonstrated smooth muscle cells in the pseudointima, and Ham 56 stain to identify macrophages. Endothelial factor VIII/von Willebrand factor and Ulex europaeus agglutinin identified human endothelial cells on the flow surface, in areas far removed from the anastomoses to the native vessels. This is the first definitive proof in a human of endothelialization of a synthetic arterial graft beyond the pannus ingrowth zone.",

    "abstract": "A case of absence of the right common carotid artery with origin of the external carotid artery from the innominate artery and origin of the internal carotid artery from the right subclavian artery proximal to the right vertebral artery is presented. Atherosclerotic occlusion at the origin of the right subclavian artery and occlusion of the left internal carotid artery resulted in a vertebrobasilar syndrome. Blood flow from the right external carotid reconstituted the right vertebral artery via muscular collateral vessels, moving first retrograde to the subclavian artery and then antegrade through the right internal carotid artery. Symptoms were successfully relieved by transposition of the internal carotid to the external carotid artery. This is the second reported case in the literature and the first to be observed in a clinical setting. The anomaly can easily be explained by embryonic persistence of the right ductus caroticus associated with involution of the right third aortic arch.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms of the gluteal arteries are rare and mostly are caused by pelvic fractures or penetrating injuries. As such these aneurysms are pseudoaneurysms. As an absolute rarity we report the case of a 43-year-old man with a histologically verified 5 cm-diameter, true saccular aneurysm of the left superior gluteal artery. The patient was admitted with 6-weeks ongoing sciatic pain without previous trauma. He was scheduled for surgery because an initial attempt of transcatheter embolization failed. By dividing the origin of the gluteus maximus muscle from the iliac crest, the aneurysm was exposed at the pelvic outlet by an extrapelvic approach and was excluded by endoaneurysmorrhaphy. Uncontrolled bleeding was prevented by temporary occlusion of the left iliac artery by a percutaneously inserted balloon catheter, thus avoiding an additional retroperitoneal approach. The postoperative course was uneventful, and sciatic pain had resolved completely. The chosen strategy provides safe and successful surgical management of gluteal artery aneurysms.",

The rate of administration of the new [+18BE] variant protamine on efficacy and toxicity in comparison to that of [+21] standard protamine and [+18B] was also studied.\nAcetyl-EAA(K2A2K2A)4K2-Amide [+18BE] was administered intravenously in a 1:1 dose to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)-anticoagulated (intravenous 150 IU antifactor Xa/kg) dogs over 10 seconds or 3 minutes (n = 7, each group). Reversal efficacy was documented by measuring activated clotting time, thrombin clotting time, antifactor Xa, and antifactor IIa. Toxicity was defined by measuring systemic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, and oxygen consumption. Measurements were made at baseline, after administration of LMWH, before its reversal, and for 30 minutes thereafter. Results were compared with those after LMWH reversal with [+21] standard protamine and the [+18B] variant. A total toxicity score (TTS) was calculated for each compound from maximal declines in blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen consumption.\nLMWH anticoagulation reversal was significantly (p < 0.01) less toxic over 10 seconds and 3 minutes with the [+18BE] designer variant (TTS -2.3, -2.2) compared with the [+21] standard protamine (TTS -6.4, -7.2). Percent LMWH reversal at 3 minutes revealed [+18BE] to have antifactor Xa activity as high as 91%, compared with 68% for protamine [+21], when given over 3 minutes (p < 0.05).\nThis investigation documents that a new designer variant of protamine [+18BE] has superior efficacy compared with [+21] standard protamine for reversal of LMWH anticoagulation and that this occurs with a highly favorable toxicity profile.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the mortality and morbidity rates associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in octogenarians and to identify factors that may influence survival in this age group.\nOne hundred fourteen patients (mean age 83 years) were admitted consecutively with 106 infrarenal and eight juxtarenal AAAs from 1984 through 1993. Ninety-four AAAs were asymptomatic, whereas 20 patients with symptoms had 11 intact and nine ruptured AAAs. The mean AAA diameter was 6.7 cm. Repair consisted of aortic bifurcation grafts in 77 patients (67%), tube grafts in 35 (31%), and extraanatomic procedures in 2 (2%). A total of 29 patients (25%) had undergone previous coronary artery bypass (24 patients) or transluminal coronary angioplasty (five patients) either incidentally or as a preliminary procedure before resection of their AAAs.\nThe 30-day mortality rate for the entire series was 14%, but it declined from 23% (11/48) during the first 5 years to 8% (5/66) during the second 5 years of the study period (p = 0.028). Fatal complications occurred in nine (9.6%) of the 94 patients with asymptomatic AAAs and in seven (35%) of the 20 patients who had symptomatic AAAs (p = 0.008). Considering only patients with asymptomatic AAAs, the early mortality rate in the second 5 years (4%) improved significantly (p = 0.038) in comparison to that (17%) for the first 5 years of the study period. The cumulative 5-year survival rate of 48% for 97 available operative survivors was not quite so good as that (59%) for the normal male population of the United States at the age of 80 years (p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the 5-year survival rate was 80% for 27 operative survivors who received previous myocardial revascularization compared with 38% for 70 others who did not (p = 0.0077). Multiple Cox-regression analysis identified the perioperative homologous blood requirement (p = 0.03) and a history of previous myocardial revascularization (p = 0.03) as significant independent factors influencing late survival.\nRepair of AAAs in properly selected octogenarians is safe and durable. When otherwise indicated, it should not be withheld on the basis of advanced age alone. Prior treatment of severe coronary artery disease is associated with enhanced late survival, but patient selection probably is an important consideration in this respect.",

An LD-SPP value of less than 30 mm Hg at the amputation site had a positive predictive value (healing failure) of 75%, (p < 0.001, chi square analysis). For major amputations, negative predictive value was 100%, and positive predictive value was 83%, (p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop an angioscopic technique to visualize the endoluminal surface of the aorta and to guide vascular stent placement.\nA fiberoptic angioscope, fitted with a balloon at its tip, was passed via a carotid arteriotomy into the abdominal aorta of seven anesthetized pigs. Saline solution inflation of the balloon allowed for blood displacement and clear visualization of the endoluminal anatomy. After the left renal artery orifice had been identified with angioscopy, a catheter was inserted via a left femoral sheath to cannulate the orifice under direct visualization. The position of the catheter was verified angiographically. A vascular stent was loaded onto an angioplasty balloon, inserted through a right femoral arteriotomy, positioned by use of angioscopic visualization, and deployed immediately below the left renal artery orifice.\nThe aortic trifurcation and the lumbar and renal artery orifices were clearly visualized in every animal. Vascular stents were placed in seven animals within an average of 3.14 +/- 1.14 mm (mean +/- SEM, range 0 to 8 mm) below the inferior rim of the left renal artery orifice. No stents were positioned above a renal artery orifice or obstructed blood flow.\nThis angioscopic technique permitted detailed evaluation of aortic endoluminal anatomy and precise implantation of vascular stents. Direct endovascular visualization may facilitate other endovascular procedures, including endovascular grafting.",

Fascia specimens were evaluated for thickness, stress failure, structural stiffness, and total collagen content and prevalence of collagen cross-linkage.\nPressures were significantly elevated in patients with CACS versus control subjects (23.8 mm Hg vs 6 mm Hg). No significant difference in tibial arterial flow could be detected in either group (43 cm/sec mean vs 41.9 cm/sec mean). Venous drainage was severely impaired in patients with CACS but not in control subjects. CACS fascia was thicker and stiffer than control fascia specimens (0.35 mm +/- 0.12 mm, 109 +/- 65 MN/mm; versus 0.22 mm +/- 0.06 mm; 60.3 +/- 22 MN/mm). Fasciectomy normalized postoperative compartment pressures and improved venous drainage. Collagen content per unit mass was similar for both CACS and control fascia specimens, although collagen cross-linking was significantly lower in the CACS fascia than in the controls.\nTibial venous drainage is impaired, but arterial flow is not in patients with CACS. Fascia thickness and structural stiffness can account for increased pressure in CACS compartments. Collagen content and cross-linkage are unrelated to fascia stiffness or thickness. Postoperative improvement in vascular hemodynamics and reduction in compartment pressure is caused by increased capacitance in the compartment after fasciectomy.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to define the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on aortic lysyl oxidase (LO), an enzyme responsible for elastin and collagen cross-linking, and aneurysm formation in the blotchy mouse. It was hypothesized that beta-blockade would inhibit the development of aneurysms because of its hemodynamic effect rather than a direct effect on LO activity.\nThree groups of mice were studied: group I--normal littermates of blotchy mice; group II--untreated blotchy mice; group III--blotchy mice given either propranolol, atenolol, or nadolol. Data from the three different beta blocker-treated animals, group III, were statistically identical and were combined for analysis. The study was concluded when the mice were 4 months of age. At that time systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and aortic diameters were measured, and the entire aorta from each mouse was subjected to a bioassay for LO activity.\nGroup I normal mice had an aortic arch diameter of 0.10 +/- 0.02 cm. Group II blotchy mice developed aortic arch aneurysms with a diameter of 0.21 +/- 0.03 cm. In Group III, beta blockade reduced the aortic arch diameter in blotchy mice to 0.11 +/- 0.03 cm. Mean heart rate in group III beta-blocked mice was reduced 25% compared with group I normal mice, and 18% compared with group II untreated blotchy mice. Blood pressures were similar in all three groups. Group II blotchy mice exhibited approximately half of the aortic LO activity (2.43 +/- 0.57 cpm/micrograms protein) noted in group I normal mice (5.82 +/- 1.06 cpm/micrograms protein). Aortic LO activity in group III blotchy mice remained low (2.09 +/- 0.85 cpm/micrograms protein) despite administration of beta-blockers.\nThis is the first study to document an actual decrease in the level of aortic LO activity in blotchy mouse. beta-Blockade inhibits development of aortic aneurysms in blotchy mice. This is associated with a reduction in heart rate, but not by alterations in LO activity.",

    "abstract": "The purpose was to determine the early and late mortality and morbidity rates associated with infrainguinal arterial prosthetic graft infection (IAPGI) and to identify optimal methods of management.\nThe study included 53 men and 14 women (mean age, 61 years) in whom a total of 68 IAPGIs developed in the years 1959 to 1993. IAPGI involved 58 femoropopliteal grafts (85%), six femorodistal grafts (9%), and four other grafts or synthetic patches (6%). Graft material was dacron in 36 (53%), polytetrafluoroethylene in 28 (41%), and human umbilical vein in four (6%). Sixteen IAPGIs (24%) involved limbs that had required amputations before IAPGI was diagnosed. Twenty-six (38%) of the 68 grafts were thrombosed, and 14 (88%) of the 16 amputees had occluded grafts.\nStaphylococcal organisms were isolated from 34 (58%) of the 59 IAPGIs for which culture data were available. The median intervals until IAPGI was diagnosed were 3 months after implantation and 1 month after the last procedure involving the original graft. Initial management consisted of local measures only in 13 (19%), partial removal or in situ graft replacement in 15 (22%), and total graft excision in 40 (59%). Total excision was performed in 15 (94%) of the 16 patients with prior amputations and in only 25 (48%) of the 52 intact limbs. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 18%; seven (58%) of the 12 early deaths were related to sepsis, and all 12 occurred within the group of 51 patients (24%) for whom limb salvage was still being attempted (p = 0.056). IAPGI ultimately led to amputations in 21 (40%) of 52 intact limbs within the first year. Twenty-three (82%) of the 28 IAPGIs managed with incomplete graft removal required subsequent operations for continued sepsis, compared with five (13%) of the 40 treated with complete excision (p < 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rate (77%) for 53 patients who survived operation was less than that (89%) for the normal, age-matched U.S. male population.\nIAPGI is associated with substantial early mortality and amputation rates. Complete excision of infected graft material results in a significant reduction in the incidence of recurrent sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Atheroembolization may cause limb loss or organ failure. Surgical outcome data are limited. We report the largest series of atheroembolization focusing on patterns of disease, surgical treatment and outcome.\nOne hundred patients (70 men), mean age 62 +/- 11 years, operated on for lower extremity, visceral, or nonthoracic outlet upper extremity atheroemboli were identified prospectively and monitored over a 12-year period. The atheroembolic source was localized by use of a combination of computed tomography scanning (n = 55), arteriography (n = 93), duplex scanning (n = 25), transesophageal echocardiography (n = 6), and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 4). Occlusive aortoiliac disease (47 patients) and small aortic aneurysms (20 patients; mean aneurysm size 3.5 +/- 0.8 cm) were the most common source of atheroemboli. Imaging studies revealed 12 patients with extensive suprarenal aortic thrombus. Correction of the embolic source was achieved with aortic bypass (n = 52), aortoiliac endarterectomy and patch (n = 11), femoral or popliteal endarterectomy and patch (n = 11), infrainguinal bypass (n = 3), extraanatomic reconstruction (n = 6), graft revision (n = 3), upper extremity bypass (n = 11), or upper extremity endarterectomy and patch (n = 3).\nAll four deaths within 30 days and all seven deaths within the first 6 months after operation were among the 12 patients with suprarenal aortic thrombus. The cumulative survival probabilities for all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 89%, 83%, and 73%, respectively. After operation, nine patients required major leg amputations and 10 required toe amputations. Renal atheroemboli led to hemodialysis in 10 patients. Recurrent embolic events occurred in five of 97 patients monitored for a mean of 32 months. All five recurrences occurred in the first 8 months after operation. Three patients with recurrent emboli had suprarenal aortic disease, one of whom had undergone axillofemorofemoral bypass. Four of 15 patients receiving postoperative warfarin anticoagulation had development of recurrent embolism. Only one patient not receiving postoperative warfarin had a recurrent event (p < 0.05 by Fisher exact test).\nThe atheroembolic source is the aorta or iliac arteries in two thirds of patients who underwent operation. Computed tomography scanning of the aorta is a useful diagnostic technique. The source of the emboli can be eliminated surgically with low mortality or limb loss rates except when the suprarenal aorta is involved.",

    "abstract": "The primary aims of this study were to delineate trends in medical comorbidity and surgical approach in patients with renal atherosclerosis and azotemia.\nWe reviewed 1643 patients undergoing renovascular surgery between 1970 and 1993. We focused on those with the most advanced kidney disease (serum creatinine > 2 mg/dl) (n = 402). Attention was focused specifically on trends in sex, age, medical risk factors, surgical technique (bypass vs endarterectomy), and outcome including eventual need for long-term dialysis.\nFrom 1970 to 1980, 652 patients underwent renovascular surgery, with 98 (15%) having a serum creatinine > 2 mg/dl. From 1980 to 1993, the percentage of patients with renal insufficiency increased to 31% (304 of 991) (p < 0.001). Gender distribution did not change, but median age rose from 63.5 years in the first decade to 68.0 in the past 13 years. A remarkable increase in all serious medical risk factors also occurred (first vs second decade). Another significant trend was a shift toward bilateral simultaneous transaortic endarterectomy (18% from 1980 to 1985 vs 53% from 1986 to 1993; p < 0.01), which simplified and achieved complete renal revascularization, especially in patients having multiple renal artery stenoses and those needing aortic grafting for occlusive or aneurysmal disease (56% from 1970 to 1980 vs 75% from 1980 to 1993). Patients at low risk (0 to 1 comorbid medical conditions) had a 30-day mortality rate of 5.6% compared with patients at high risk (2 to 3 comorbid conditions) (15.5%) (p = 0.016). The eventual need for long-term dialysis remained low (9%) for patients with a preoperative serum creatinine of 2 to 2.9 mg/dl compared with those with a serum creatinine greater than 3 mg/dl (35%, p < 0.01).\nIn the past 20 years, there has been a remarkable increase in the medical comorbidity and extent of aortic disease in patients undergoing surgical revascularization for advanced renovascular hypertension and renal insufficiency. However, the surgical approach can be simplified and expedited by bilateral transaortic endarterectomy, and the risk of late dialysis can be reduced significantly by operating before the serum creatinine exceeds 3 mg/dl.",

Group 1 muscles were subjected to 5 hours of ischemia and 20 hours of reperfusion (n = 10); group 2 muscles received pentoxifylline, 15 mg/kg, systemic infusion 10 minutes before reperfusion (n = 6); group 3 muscles received pentoxifylline, 25 mg/kg, systemic infusion 10 minutes before reperfusion (n = 6). PAF was measured from muscle venous effluent by the scintillation proximity assay method. Muscle injury was assessed by vital staining and planimetry.\nPAF levels in group 2 were decreased at 10, 15, and 30 minutes of reperfusion compared with group 1 but did not reach significance. PAF levels in group 3 were decreased at all times of reperfusion compared with group 1 but attained significance only at 10 minutes of reperfusion (p < 0.05). No significant differences in muscle weight were noted among the three groups. No differences in the extent of muscle necrosis was observed between group 1 (77.26% +/- 20.38%) and group 2 (60.49% +/- 23.97%) (p = 0.08); there was a significant reduction in the extent of muscle necrosis in group 3 (44.55% +/- 21.47%) compared with group 1 (p < 0.05).\nThe administration of pentoxifylline at 25 mg/kg before reperfusion of ischemic skeletal muscle decreased significantly the extent of muscle necrosis and PAF levels in the venous effluents at all times of reperfusion (significantly at 10 minutes). These results suggest that pentoxifylline may decrease tissue injury of ischemia-reperfusion by inhibiting the production of PAF during critical periods of reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "Many authors have reported extended relief of intestinal ischemia by use of a variety of reconstructive techniques, but all have relied on symptomatic follow-up. None have objectively measured patency rates. The purpose of this study was to determine the primary patency rates of bypass grafts placed for acute and chronic splanchnic atherosclerotic occlusive disease with use of objective follow-up with mesenteric duplex ultrasound scanning or arteriography.\nTwenty-five consecutive patients (mean age 61, female/male ratio of 2.7:1) who underwent placement of 38 splanchnic bypass grafts (29 saphenous vein grafts, 9 polytetrafluoroethylene) (22 retrograde, 16 antegrade) for ischemic symptoms (9 acute ischemia: 16 chronic ischemia) between 1984 and 1994 were monitored with either duplex scanning (30 grafts) or arteriography. Life-table and log rank analysis were used to determine and compare graft patency.\nThree patients (12%, 2 acute ischemia and 1 chronic ischemia) died after operation. Six patients (30%) had significant morbidity (4 acute ischemia and 2 chronic ischemia). During follow-up from 1 to 136 months (mean 35 months), no patient died of bowel infarction or required revision for recurrent symptoms. Objective testing revealed three graft occlusions. Symptomatic follow-up had a sensitivity of only 33% for graft occlusion when compared with objective measurement. The life-table primary patency rate was 89% at 72 months. Life-table survival for the same patients was 75% at 36 months. Patency rates for antegrade (93% at 36 months) versus retrograde (95% at 36 months) bypass and saphenous vein grafts (95% at 36 months) versus polytetrafluoroethylene (89% at 36 months) were not significantly different (p = 0.47 and 0.43, respectively). Late patency rates of grafts placed for acute ischemia (92% at 36 months) versus chronic ischemia (89% at 36 months) were not significantly different (p = 0.77).\nSplanchnic bypass for mesenteric ischemia, with a primary patency rate of 89% at 72 months, is an extremely durable form of revascularization. Long-term patency of grafts placed for acute ischemia does not differ significantly from that of bypasses for chronic occlusion. Duplex scanning allows standardized objective periodic follow-up of splanchnic reconstruction. Objective assessment is critical to accurately measure visceral revascularization patency rates.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate and update the results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in two community hospitals over a 17-year period and to determine whether there had been any reduction in the unacceptably high incidence of complications previously reported from these same two hospitals.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records of 1981 patients who underwent 2243 CEAs from July 1976 to November 1993.\nThere were 36 operative deaths (1.6%) and 120 operative strokes (5.3%), for a combined stroke-mortality rate of 6.3%. The mortality, stroke, and combined stroke-mortality rates all decreased significantly (p < 10(-5)) compared with the rates reported in the original study (6.6%, 14.5%, and 21.1%, respectively). Nonfatal stroke rates decreased significantly for patients diagnosed with asymptomatic carotid artery disease, 18.2% to 2.9% (p = 0.04); transient ischemic attacks, 17.8% to 3.9% (p < 10(-6)); and prior stroke, 15.2% to 8.0% (p = 0.04). Improvement in combined stroke-mortality rates occurred for all operative indications, but was significant only in the transient ischemic (p < 10(-8)) and prior stroke groups (p = 0.00002). Surgical experience varied, with 31 surgeons performing one to 236 CEAs. Although results were not significantly correlated with individual operative activity, 10 surgeons who performed more than 12 CEAs per year had a statistically lower incidence of operative stroke (4.1%) compared with 21 surgeons who performed fewer procedures (7.2%) (p = 0.009). The incidence of stroke (2.7%) and the combined stroke-mortality rate (3.7%) of surgeons with additional vascular training was superior to the stroke rate (6.8%) and combined stroke-mortality rate (7.9%) of surgeons who did not (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0006); but several surgeons in the latter group had results that were comparable to those of the vascular group.\nAlthough overall operative complication rates in these two community hospitals have declined dramatically compared with previously reported results, they are still not optimal and probably will remain high as long as individual surgeons with high complication rates continue to perform CEAs.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the distribution of aortic wall microvessels in normal aorta, atheroocclusive disease (AOD), and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and to evaluate whether medial neovascularization (MNV) is a reliable histopathologic marker of aneurysmal degeneration.\nAortic tissue specimens (9 normal, 10 AOD, and 10 AAA) were examined for elastin with Verhoeff-van Gieson stain and for Ulex europaeus type I lectin, an endothelial-specific antigen, and laminin, a marker of basement membranes, by immunohistochemistry. The density of MNV was determined by morphometry of aortic sections stained for endothelium. The spatial distribution of aortic microvessels was compared with that of elastin destruction and chronic inflammation.\nEvidence of medial neovascularization was generally not observed in normal aorta or AOD, whereas AAAs showed strong spatial correlations between MNV, disruption and degradation of elastin, and chronic inflammation in the outer aortic wall. Several specimens of AOD had focal areas of MNV associated with localized elastin fragmentation and monocytic infiltration located at the interface between the atherosclerotic plaque and the inner media. The density of MNV was about fifteenfold higher in AAA compared with normal aorta and about threefold higher compared with AOD (microvessels per high-power field): normal aorta, 0.77 +/- 0.28; AOD, 3.40 +/- 0.51; AAA, 11.32 +/- 1.58 (ANOVA, p < 0.001).\nThe presence and density of MNV in the abdominal aorta is a consistent histopathologic marker of aneurysmal degeneration that is spatially correlated with the destruction of elastin and chronic inflammation. The observation of focal MNV in some specimens of AOD, associated with partial elastin disruption, raises the possibility that early changes of aneurysm disease might develop by an extension of angiogenic/inflammatory processes from the atherosclerotic plaque into the aortic media.",

    "abstract": "The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) showed that carotid endarterectomy reduces stroke risk in symptom-free patients with 60% or greater internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. This will surely lead to the performance of an increased number of screening duplex examinations. Assuming that positive study results will lead to arteriography or endarterectomy and keeping in mind the modest benefit for prophylactic endarterectomy demonstrated by ACAS (absolute risk reduction for ipsilateral stroke of 5.8% at 5 years), duplex criteria for 60% or greater ICA stenosis must have high positive predictive values (PPV). Determining criteria for 60% or greater stenosis, which emphasized high accuracy and PPV, forms the basis for this study.\nStenoses detected by angiography in 352 ICAs were blindly compared with those detected by duplex scanning. Duplex criteria were determined for highest overall accuracy in detection of 60% or greater ICA stenosis and for 95% or greater PPV.\nMaximal accuracy for detection of 60% or greater stenosis was 90%. This was achieved by the combination of a peak systolic velocity of 260 cm/sec or greater and an end diastolic velocity of 70 cm/sec or greater (sensitivity 84%, specificity 94%, PPV 92%). The 95% PPV for 60% or greater stenosis results from combining peak systolic velocity of 290 cm/sec or greater and end diastolic velocity of 80 cm/sec or greater.\nWith use of these criteria duplex scanning accurately detects with high PPVs the threshold level of ICA stenosis defined in ACAS as receiving stroke reduction benefit from prophylactic carotid endarterectomy. These criteria should be useful for carotid artery screening and minimizing unneeded intervention.",

    "abstract": "The intent of the study was to determine whether ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) could indicate acuteness and stability of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities.\nThrombi presenting as filling defects on color Doppler imaging in the common or superficial femoral or popliteal veins in 50 extremities in 45 patients with DVT were studied. Acute DVT was less than 4 days duration, and chronic DVT was greater than 21 days duration. UTC analysis of parameters from the normalized power spectrum of backscattered ultrasound signals from venous filling defects was performed. This spectrum approaches a straight line, and its basic parameters, slope, and Y-intercept are related to scatterer size, concentration, and the square of the scatterer-to-medium acoustic impedances. Ten of the DVT extremities were reexamined at 1 week to assess UTC changes that would indicate thrombus instability.\nAcute DVT (19 of the 50 extremities) could be distinguished from chronic DVT, mainly on the basis of significantly higher intercept values for the acute group, which were 11.6 relative decibels (dBr) higher than those of the chronic DVT group. Discriminant linear analysis of the two parameters indicated a sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 90.3% in correctly diagnosing acute DVT. In a small sample of 10 extremities reexamined at 1 week, acute DVT extremities showed a mean 9.4 dBr decrease in intercept values with no significant change in slope.\nUTC distinguished clinically defined acute from chronic DVT. In a small series of extremities, UTC revealed significant instability of acute thrombi in a selected patient population.",

Ten patients had postdissection aneurysms. Operative techniques consisted of evoked spinal cord potential (ESP-dsc) monitoring and femorofemoral bypass in all cases, segmental resection in 12, and mild systemic hypothermia in eight. Arteries critical for cord blood flow were selectively reconstructed; if ESP-dsc showed change after resection of an aortic segment, arteries originating from this segment were reconstructed.\nESP-dsc change was observed in 12 patients. Arteries found to be critical were at the T8-L1 level in all but three cases. Selective reconstruction was performed in 10 of these 12 patients. ESP-dsc change could be reversed before reconstruction in four cases, three by control of back-bleeding critical arteries. Selective reconstruction resulted in return of ESP-dsc in seven other patients. Spinal cord injury occurred in five patients, two of whom did not undergo selective reconstruction.\nThese results suggest that our current technique allows determination of critical arteries but does not completely prevent injury.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed with continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring provides a unique opportunity to determine the number of cerebral microemboli and to relate their occurrence to the surgical technique. The purpose of this study was to assess in CEA the impact of cerebral microembolism on clinical outcome and brain architecture. We also evaluated the influence of the audible transcranial Doppler signal on the surgeon and his or her technique.\nIn a prospective series of 301 patients, CEA was monitored with electroencephalography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors were entered in a logistic regression analysis program to assess their correlation with cerebral outcome. To evaluate the impact of cerebral microembolism on brain architecture, we compared preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance images of the brain in two subgroups of 58 and 40 patients, respectively.\nSeven (2.3%) patients had intraoperative transient ischemic symptoms, three (1%) had intraoperative strokes, 1 (0.3%) had transient ischemic symptoms after operation, and 10 (3.3%) had postoperative strokes. Four (1.3%) patients died. Microemboli (> 10) noticed during dissection were related to both intraoperative (p < 0.002) and postoperative (p < 0.02) cerebral complications. Microemboli that occurred during shunting were also related to intraoperative complications (p < 0.007). Microembolism never resulted in new morphologic changes on postoperative computed tomography scans. On the contrary, the phenomenon of more than 10 microemboli during dissection was significantly (p < 0.005) related to new hyperintense lesions on postoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance images.\nDuring CEA the presence of microembolism (> 10 microemboli) during dissection shows a statistically significant relationship with perioperative cerebral complications and with new ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance images of the brain. Moreover, microembolism during shunting is also related to intraoperative complications. Surgeons can be guided by the audio Doppler and emboli signals by changing their technique. This change may result in a decrease of microembolism and consequently in a decline of the intraoperative stroke rate.",

    "abstract": "Enhancement of the fibrinolytic activity of vascular cells by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) gene transfer has considerable clinical potential. However, it is unknown whether greater constitutive expression of the tPA gene might increase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) secretion, which could negate expected increases in fibrinolytic activity that accompany greater tPA protein production. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether transduction of human endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) with a retroviral vector containing the human tPA gene would increase tPA production and what effect this would have on endogenous PAI-1 secretion and subsequent fibrinolytic activity.\nCultivated human EC and SMC either were transduced with a murine leukemia retroviral vector (MFG) containing the human tPA gene and, in the case of controls, the lacZ gene, or they were exposed to media alone. On days 14 and 28 after transduction, supernatent tPA antigen and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured by ELISA, and supernatent tPA activity was quantitated with a spectrolyse tPA/PAI assay.\nSouthern and Northern blot analyses documented integration and transcription of the tPA gene in both EC and SMC. Greater tPA antigen production occurred in MFG-tPA-transduced EC and SMC compared with nontransduced or MFG-lac Z-transduced cells (p < 0.05). The tPA activity increased in transduced human saphenous vein EC (up to 5.1-fold) and human iliac artery EC (up to 4.7-fold), but no increased tPA activity occurred in transduced SMC, compared with nontransduced or MFG-lac Z-transduced cells (p < 0.05). PAI-1 antigen was unchanged in transduced SMC but decreased in MFG-tPA-transduced EC (p < 0.05). PAI-1 mRNA was unchanged in the transduced EC and SMC compared with nontransduced cells, suggesting that posttranslational events may have caused the changes in EC PAI-1.\nThis investigation demonstrated that MFG-mediated tPA gene transfer into human EC resulted in a significant increase in tPA activity. Enhancement of adult human EC fibrinolytic activity by transfer of the human tPA gene has not been previously reported and represents a necessary finding in the development of this gene therapy technology for the prevention of thrombotic complications of vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report interobserver and intraobserver variability of computed tomography (CT) measurements of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter and agreement between CT and ultrasonography observed in the course of a large, multicenter, randomized trial on the management of small AAAs.\nCT measurements of AAA diameter from participating centers were compared with measurements made from the same scan by a central laboratory. Blinded central remeasurement of a randomly selected subset of these CT scans was used to assess intraobserver variability. Agreement between AAA measurements by CT and ultrasonography done within 30 days of each other was also assessed.\nFor interobserver pairs of local and central CT measurements of AAA diameter (n = 806), the difference was 0.2 cm or less in 65% of pairs, but 17% differed by at least 0.5 cm. For intraobserver pairs of central CT remeasurements (n = 70), 90% differed by 0.2 cm or less, 70% were within 0.1 cm, and only one differed by 0.5 cm. Of 258 ultrasound-measured and central CT pairs, the difference was 0.2 cm or less in 44% and at least 0.5 cm in 33%. Ultrasound measurements were smaller than central CT measurements by an average of 0.27 cm (p < 0.0001). Local CT and ultrasound measurements showed a marked preference for recording by half centimeter.\nA high degree of precision is possible in CT measurement of AAA diameter, but this precision may not be obtained in practice because of differences in measurement techniques. Differences between imaging modalities increase variability further. Variations in AAA measurement of 0.5 cm or more are not uncommon, and this should be taken into account in management decisions. Efforts to reduce variation in measurement are warranted and might include (1) seeking agreement between surgeons and radiologists on a precise definition of AAA diameter, (2) limiting the number of radiologists who measure AAAs, and (3) use of calipers and magnifying glass for CT measurements.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients undergoing vascular surgery can provide information with respect to perioperative and long-term risk for CAD-related events. However, the extent to which the required surgical procedure itself imparts additional risk beyond that dictated by the presence of CAD determinants remains in question. The purpose of this study was to quantify the relative contributions of specific vascular procedures and CAD markers on perioperative and long-term cardiac risk.\nThe study cohort comprised 547 patients undergoing vascular surgery from two medical centers who underwent clinical evaluation, dipyridamole thallium testing, and either aortic (n = 321), infrainguinal (n = 177), or carotid (n = 49) vascular surgery between 1984 and 1991. Perioperative and late cardiac risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) was compared for the three procedures before and after adjustment for the influence of comorbid factors. These adjusted estimates may be regarded as the component of risk because of type of surgery.\nPerioperative MI occurred in 6% of patients undergoing aortic and carotid artery surgery, and in 13% of patients undergoing infrainguinal procedures (p = 0.019). Significant (p < 0.05) predictors of MI were history of angina, fixed and reversible dipyridamole thallium defects, and ischemic ST depression during testing. Although patients undergoing infrainguinal procedures exhibited more than twice the risk for perioperative MI compared with patients undergoing aortic surgery (relative risk: 2.4[1.2 to 4.5, p = 0.008]), this value was reduced to insignificant levels (1.6[0.8 to 3.2, p = 0.189]) after adjustment for comorbid factors. There was little change in comparative risk between carotid artery and aortic procedures before (1.0[0.3 to 3.6, p = 0.95]) or after (0.6[0.2 to 2.3, p = 0.4]) covariate adjustment. The 4-year cumulative event-free survival rate was 90% +/- 2% for aortic, 74% +/- 5% for infrainguinal, and 78% +/- 7% for carotid artery procedures (p = 0.0001). Predictors of late MI included history of angina, congestive heart failure, diabetes, fixed dipyridamole thallium defects, and perioperative MI. Patients undergoing infrainguinal procedures exhibited a threefold greater risk for late events compared with patients undergoing aortic procedures (relative risk: 3.0[1.8 to 5.1, p = 0.005]), but this value was reduced to 1.3(0.8 to 2.3, p = 0.32) after adjustment. Long-term risk among patients undergoing carotid artery surgery was less dramatically altered by risk factor adjustment.\nIn current practice, among patients referred for dipyridamole testing before operation, observed differences in cardiac risk of vascular surgery procedures may be primarily attributable to readily identifiable CAD risk factors rather than to the specific type of vascular surgery. Thus the cardiac and diabetic status of patients should be given careful consideration whenever possible, regardless of surgical procedure to be performed.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed an 18-year experience with combined abdominal aortic and renal artery reconstruction (AOR) with a particular focus on patients' clinical risk profile and surgical results in contemporary practice as compared with earlier experience.\nOne hundred seventy patients underwent AOR during the interval January 1, 1976 to June 30, 1994. To examine parameters representative of current practice, the cohort was divided into group I patients (n = 110) treated before 1990 and group II (n = 60) treated between 1990 and 1994. Median follow-up duration for the entire cohort was 8.4 +/- 0.6 years. Renal artery reconstruction patency and patient survival rates were calculated by life-table methods. Logistic and Cox regression analysis were used to determine predictors of perioperative and long-term morbidity/mortality rates.\nAlthough demographic features changed little over the review period, the detection (56% vs 73%, p = 0.03) and treatment with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/coronary artery bypass grafting (11% vs 40%, p = 0.0001) of associated coronary artery disease were more frequent in group I patients. The operative mortality rate for the entire cohort was 6.5% (group I = 9% vs group II = 2%, p = 0.06). Changing trends of surgical techniques over the review period included (group I vs II, respectively) increased use of bilateral simultaneous renal artery repair (12% vs 25%, p < 0.005) and transaortic endarterectomy as the renal artery reconstruction technique (3% vs 25%, p < 0.0001). Favorable response in blood pressure control was noted in 68% of group II patients. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for all patients was 75% with an initial serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or greater being the only negative predictor of late survival after regression analysis.\nThe current operative mortality rate for AOR is in the range anticipated for aortic surgery alone, and this appears to be related to improved detection and treatment of associated coronary artery disease and intervention before major deterioration in renal function. These findings coupled with currently available natural history data relative to renovascular disease justify an aggressive approach with AOR when significant renal artery stenosis is detected during evaluation of aortic disease.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that intravenous glucagon significantly improves rat survival if given after release of superior mesenteric artery occlusion. The purpose of this study was to isolate the effects of glucagon on the intestine by creating a rat model of segmental mesenteric ischemia that avoids the systemic shock associated with total superior mesenteric artery occlusion and reperfusion.\nIn 18 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, an 8 cm segment of midileum was made totally ischemic for 110 minutes by occluding its vascular arcades and the bowel ends with microvascular clamps. Control animals (n = 8) received normal saline solution (10 ml/kg/hr intravenously) during ischemia and for 2 hours after declamping. Ten animals also received glucagon (1 microgram/kg/min intravenously) during 2 hours after declamping. After a 24-hour recovery, the ischemic bowel segment, plus nonischemic proximal ileum, was examined histologically by computerized planimetry to measure wall thickness (muscularis, mucosa, and transmural), percent epithelial coverage, and villar surface ratio (villar surface length/bowel circumference). All observations were blinded. Comparisons were made by Student's t test.\nCompared with nonischemic ileum, the ischemic segment in control animals showed severe mucosal injury with a reduction in mucosal thickness to 25%, epithelial coverage to 23%, and villar surface ratio to 33% of that seen in nonischemic ileum (p < 0.01). Substantial preservation of ileal mucosal viability was seen in glucagon-treated animals. Mucosal thickness and epithelial coverage were twice as well preserved in glucagon-treated rats compared with control rats (p < 0.05), and villar surface ratio was also increased significantly (p < 0.05). The muscularis was not significantly injured in this model.\nBy use of quantitative histologic measurements, we found that intravenous glucagon significantly improved ileal mucosal viability when given early during reperfusion after segmental ischemia. The mechanism of this effect and its potential clinical application merit further study.",

    "abstract": "Contrast arteriography (CA) is a useful but invasive technique for the preoperative evaluation of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). To evaluate the use of magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) as a preoperative study we prospectively studied 38 patients undergoing AAA repair.\nAll patients underwent biplane CA and MRA with use of a gadolinium-enhanced technique. Radiographic studies were then independently evaluated by blinded radiologists for anatomic findings with CA used as the standard. Studies were then independently evaluated by blinded vascular surgeons, and a surgical plan was made.\nWith CA and intraoperative findings as the standards, MRA proved highly accurate in the determination of multiple key anatomic elements. The proximal extent of aneurysmal disease was correctly predicted in 87% (33/38) patients. Significant iliofemoral occlusive disease was identified with a sensitivity of 83% (5/6). Iliac or femoral aneurysms were detected with a sensitivity of 79% (22/28) and specificity of 86% (41/48). Significant renal artery stenosis was detected with a sensitivity of 71% (12/17) and a specificity of 99% (72/73). Accessory renal arteries were correctly identified in 71% (12/17). Surgeon evaluators correctly predicted the proximal cross-clamp site in 87% (33/38) of patients with use of MRA as compared with the actual operative conduct. Proximal anastomotic sites were correctly predicted in 95% (36/38) with MRA and 97% (37/38) with CA. Renal revascularization was predicted by MRA with a sensitivity of 91% (10/11) and specificity of 100% (65/65). The use of bifurcated aortic prostheses was correctly predicted by MRA in 75% (12/16), which was similar to that predicted by CA (81%, 13/16).\nMRA can provide preoperative anatomic information that is equivalent to CA for surgical planning. Because of favorable cost and patient safety considerations MRA will assume increasing importance in the preoperative evaluation of AAA.",

    "abstract": "There is no clinically useful therapy for the suppression of vein bypass graft intimal hyperplasia (IH). Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a technique that uses light to activate otherwise biologically inert photosensitizers to produce cytotoxic effects, has been demonstrated to successfully inhibit experimental IH in balloon-injured arteries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of PDT as a method to reduce vein graft IH.\nReversed external jugular vein bypass grafts of the common carotid artery were performed in 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals received either chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (2.5 mg/kg intravenously) 24 hours before the ex vivo irradiation of the vein grafts (VG) with 100 joule/cm2 at 675 nm (PDT VG) or saline solution as control (CON VG). Preharvest bromodeoxyuridine was administered to label proliferating cells. All vein grafts were perfusion fixed within 96 hours for a pilot study or at 2 and 4 weeks for the main study. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and morphometric analysis were performed.\nThere was no acute thrombus formation in the hypocellular PDT VG with occasional platelets but no leukocytes adherent to the luminal surface. Intimal areas of the PDT VG were 18% at 2 weeks and 53% at 4 weeks of the CON VGs (p < 0.05). Medial areas and percent of stenoses were also significantly less in PDT than in CON VG. However, intimal hyperplasia noted in the longitudinal sections within 2 mm of the anastomoses did not demonstrate a difference between PDT and CON VG. Intimal hyperplasia of both PDT and CON VG consisted of smooth muscle cells, verified by immunohistochemistry. Bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells were more abundant in 2-week than in 4-week specimens, were found most frequently in the intimal areas of the CON VG body, and were equivalent in the anastomoses of PDT VG and CON VG.\nThese data suggest that PDT of vein grafts suppresses the development of IH in the body of the vein graft but does not affect IH adjacent to the anastomoses. The artery may be the source of proliferating smooth muscle cells that contribute to the anastomotic vein graft IH.",

    "abstract": "The role of infrainguinal arterial reconstructive surgery for claudication is controversial. We reviewed the results of femorotibial bypass procedures performed in a select group of patients with disabling claudication in an attempt to define a role for this aggressive approach.\nData were retrieved from the vascular registry, and hospital records were obtained for all patients undergoing femorotibial reconstruction for disabling claudication during the past 16 years at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Follow-up interviews were obtained to assess overall health, walking impairment, functional status, and patient satisfaction.\nDuring a 16-year period a total of 57 tibial reconstructions were performed in 53 patients for claudication (5% of all infrainguinal vein reconstructions). Autogenous vein conduit was used in all cases, most of which (70%) involved the greater saphenous vein in situ. Distal anastamoses were to the tibioperoneal trunk (12%), anterior tibial (18%), posterior tibial (47%), and peroneal (23%) arteries. Major complications occurred in 9%, and no perioperative deaths occurred. Overall 5-year survival was 54% +/- 15%, and no major amputations were performed. Cumulative primary and secondary graft patency at 5 years were 81% +/- 6% and 86% +/- 5%, respectively. Patency rates were significantly better than those achieved in a concurrent series of tibial bypasses for limb salvage and were equivalent to those achieved with femoropopliteal bypass for claudication. Interviewed patients reported improved walking distance, reduced claudication, and a high degree of overall satisfaction with their operation.\nResults obtained with femorotibial bypass performed for claudication were superior to those obtained for limb salvage and were equivalent to those obtained with femoropopliteal bypass for claudication. The results obtained in this highly selected cohort suggest that patients at low risk with significant functional impairment from claudication, available autogenous vein, and suitable tibial outflow to the ischemic muscular bed can be offered revascularization with the expectation of durable long-term results.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether noninvasive evaluation with duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography of patients with carotid artery stenosis can replace contrast angiography at our institution.\nThis study consisted of a retrospective chart review of 40 patients (74 carotid arteries) in combination with a blinded reanalysis of original data. Contrast angiography was compared with duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography. The overall diagnostic accuracy of duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography was determined individually and concordantly in patients being evaluated for carotid artery stenosis.\nThe overall sensitivity of duplex ultrasonography was 88.5%, and the specificity was 91.7% (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.8456; p < 0.001). For magnetic resonance angiography the sensitivity was 92.3%, and the specificity was 97.9% (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.9086; p < 0.001). In the presence of concordance, the noninvasive studies exhibited a sensitivity of 100%, (correlation coefficient = 0.9661; kappa value = 0.9655). No occlusions or severe lesions were missed by both studies. In only one vessel (1.52%) was a false-positive concordance noted.\nCarotid endarterectomy may be undertaken with a high degree of confidence that the operation will be appropriate if the noninvasive evaluations are concordant. In the absence of concordance of the noninvasive studies, contrast angiography should be considered.",

    "abstract": "We report four cases of laparoscopic vascular procedures (two iliofemoral bypasses, one aortobifemoral bypass, and one aortoiliac endarterectomy) performed with a technique that does not require insufflation of the peritoneal cavity with gas.\nInitially in the porcine model and later in patients, we developed a laparoscopic technique with a mechanical arm used to mechanically elevate the abdominal wall, creating a working cavity. Conventional vascular instruments were used in combination with laparoscopic devices. Five to seven ports were needed for the procedures (four to six ports of 0.5 to 1.5 cm and one incision of 4.0 cm). Exposure was maintained by use of roticulating fan retractors and laparotomy sponges. End-to-side technique was used for all graft anastamoses (cross-clamp time of 40 to 70 minutes). Distal anastamoses were performed through an open femoral incision. Operative time was 5 hours (iliac procedure) and 7 hours (aortic procedure).\nAll patients were ambulating and tolerating a regular diet within 24 hours (iliac procedures) or 48 hours (aortic procedures) after operation. They were discharged home on the second (iliac procedures) or third (aortic procedures) postoperative day. Within 1 week they had resumed normal daily activities. No complications occurred, and no blood bank products were transfused. When compared with the standard surgical approach, gasless laparoscopic technique gave a faster postoperative recovery with less pain and decreased the risk of wound herniation, dehiscence, and infection. From a laparoscopic standpoint, the use of disposable instruments was minimized and the theoretical risk of CO2 embolism eliminated.\nThese four cases demonstrate that laparoscopic vascular bypass procedures are feasible and that the accepted advantages of laparoscopy can be extended to patients undergoing vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported that 3% to 8% of patients who have had resection of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm will subsequently have development of a new aortic aneurysm proximal to the repair. The actual incidence, pathogenesis, and natural history of these aneurysms are unclear. The purpose of this study is to better characterize subsequent proximal aortic aneurysms and to evaluate the outcome of their operative repair.\nWe retrospectively reviewed our recent experience with surgery for new proximal aortic aneurysms in 123 patients who had had a prior abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Seventy-two patients (58.5%) were admitted with chest or abdominal pain, six (4.9%) were admitted with ruptured aneurysms, and 41 (33.3%) were symptom free. Most subsequent aneurysms involved the thoracoabdominal aorta (n = 94; 76.4%); others involved the juxtarenal abdominal aorta, descending thoracic aorta, or transverse aortic arch. The new aneurysm was in continuity with the existing prosthetic graft in 101 cases (82.1%). Resection and graft replacement of the aneurysmal segment was performed on an emergency basis in patients with evidence of impending rupture and electively when aneurysmal diameter exceeded 5.5 cm. The average time interval between the two operations was 8.2 +/- 5.4 years. Mean aortic clamp and visceral ischemic times were 39.7 +/- 14.7 and 33.5 +/- 12.8 minutes, respectively.\nThe in-hospital mortality rate was 12.2%. Complications included oliguric kidney failure in 11.4% and paraplegia in 4.1%. These results compare favorably with previous studies.\nOn the basis of the significant prevalence of subsequent proximal aortic aneurysms and the high mortality rate associated with their rupture, we recommend resection of the entire infrarenal aorta during abdominal aortic aneurysm replacement, followed by long-term surveillance with biannual computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the chest and abdomen. Early diagnosis is facilitated by a high index of suspicion and allows surgical intervention to occur before life-threatening rupture. Both emergency and elective proximal aortic surgery in these patients can be performed with acceptable levels of morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia is a common cause of obstructive stenosis after arterial reconstructive procedures. It has been postulated that growth factors elaborated by vascular wall cells regulate fibroproliferative changes that can cause graft failure. This study characterizes transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) and platelet-derived growth factor-A chain (PDGF-A) mRNA transcript profiles and their temporal relationship to the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.\nEpigastric vein-to-common femoral artery interposition grafts were performed in male Lewis rats (350 to 450 gm) with standard microsurgical techniques. Grafts were harvested at 1 and 4 hours, 1 and 4 days, and 1 and 2 weeks (n = 5/time). Graft RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction with sense/antisense primers for TGF-beta 1 and PDGF-A (30 cycles). Polymerase chain reaction fragments were confirmed by Southern hybridization.\nVariable induction of TFG-beta 1 gene transcription was evident in vein grafts at 1 and 4 hours, with prominent mRNA expression from 1 day to 2 weeks. PDGF-A mRNA was detected in ungrafted control veins but was downregulated at 1 hour and absent at 4 hours after grafting. PDGF-A transcription was upregulated by 1 day, with prominent expression from 4 days to 1 week. Early loss of PDGF-A mRNA correlated with the early denudation of the endothelium, whereas upregulation by 4 days was preceded by TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression.\nUpregulation of TGF-beta 1 and PDGF-A mRNA expression is detected in vein grafts before the development of a quantifiable neointima, which occurs by 2 weeks in our model. This suggests a role for these growth factors in the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the distribution of reflux in the veins adjacent to or within the venous ulcer (local) and to correlate it with the pattern of disease of the axial veins (all veins away from the ulcer area) of the affected limb.\nForty-three ulcers in 34 legs of 33 patients were examined with color-flow duplex imaging. The veins in the area of the ulcer were scanned with a sterile technique.\nIn 17 legs (50%) there was documented past deep venous thrombosis. All of the 34 limbs had reflux in the superficial or deep axial veins either alone or in combination. Fifteen of these limbs (44%) also had perforating vein incompetence, but none had perforator incompetence alone. Six ulcers showed no evidence of reflux in the local veins when scanned through the ulcer bed despite the presence of reflux in the axial veins of the limb. In 13 limbs with 17 ulcers, either the superficial axial veins alone or the deep axial veins alone were affected (with or without associated perforator incompetence). Examination of the local veins associated with these 17 ulcers revealed a similar pattern of reflux to that seen in the axial veins in 13 cases, with the remaining 4 ulcers showing no local venous abnormality. The pattern of reflux was less predictable at the local ulcer level in limbs where both superficial and deep venous incompetence coexisted in the axial veins. Only 7 of the 26 ulcers (27%) in these limbs had similar evidence of combined superficial and deep reflux in the local ulcer veins, whereas 10 ulcers (39%) were associated with local reflux in the superficial or deep veins alone.\nThese data show that 86% (37/43) of the ulcers has some degree of reflux in the local area, the pattern of which may differ from the axial vein disease. Treatment of the local hemodynamic abnormalities may be an important factor in the healing of the ulcers and in the prevention of their recurrence.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular signalling mechanisms that modulate the sustained vascular smooth muscle contractions that occur with vasospasm are not well understood. The purpose of this investigation was to examine cell signalling mechanisms that account for sustained vascular smooth muscle contraction, independent of increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i).\nFresh bovine carotid artery smooth muscles contractile responses were examined in a muscle bath. [Ca2+]i was depleted by use of the extracellular Ca2+ chelator, ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and the intracellular chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid.\nIn Ca(2+)-free conditions, depolarizing the membrane with high extracellular KCI failed to elicit a contraction. In addition, in Ca(2+)-free conditions the ([Ca2+]i) was less than 10 nmol/L as determined with the Ca(2+)-indicator, Fura 2. The protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu), induced slowly developing sustained contractions in bovine carotid artery smooth muscle, and the magnitude of the contractile response to PDBu (10 nmol/L to 10 mumol/L) was the same in the presence and absence of Ca2+. PDBu induced contractions in Ca(2+)-free conditions were not inhibited by the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, ML-9 (50 mumol/L), but were inhibited by the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (50 nmol/L).\nThese data suggest that vascular smooth muscle contractions can occur under conditions where the [Ca2+]i is low and fixed and that these contractions may be mediated by PKC.",

Eighteen high carotid endarterectomy flaps in 16 patients have been subsequently secured with the laser welding technique.\nLaser repairs (125 +/- 19 joule) of the canine arteries were completed more quickly than suture repairs (mean 25 seconds vs 135 seconds, respectively; p < 0.04). Duplex ultrasonography revealed no discernable differences between the two groups of arteries. Arteries studied at 7 days revealed three microscopic flaps (two suture, one laser), more subintimal fibroblastic proliferation in suture than laser-repaired carotid arteries (3: 1, p = 0.0530), and similar amounts of inflammation in suture- and laser-repaired arteries. Arteries studied at 28 days revealed one microscopic intimal flap (suture-repaired); equal fibroblastic and inflammatory responses in suture- and laser-repaired vessels; and no evidence of laser thermal injury. Eighteen carotid endarterectomy flaps have been successfully fused with no immediate or long-term complications in 16 patients (follow-up of 0 to 24 months).\nLaser fusion appears to be a safe and effective method for securing distal carotid endarterectomy flaps.",

    "abstract": "We sought to determine whether low-dose radiation can inhibit neointimal hyperplasia immediately after balloon injury to the common carotid artery and to assess the extent of endothelial regeneration after treatment.\nSprague-Dawley rats were subjected to balloon injury to the common carotid artery. Immediately after injury rats were treated with a single dose of iridium 192 radiation at 5 gy, 10 gy, and 15 gy or received no radiation (control). Three weeks after injury and treatment, vessels were harvested and compartment areas were measured on fixed specimens. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, along with Evans blue dye uptake into injured vessels, was used to assess the effect radiation had on endothelial regeneration.\nRats receiving radiation at all three doses demonstrated no intimal thickening when compared with rats that were not treated (at 5 Gy 0.01 +/- 0.01 mm2; at 10 Gy 0.02 +/- 0.01 mm2; at 15 Gy 0.05 +/- 0.02 mm2; with balloon injury/no radiation 0.12 +/- 0.02 mm2; p < 0.01). In addition, the groups that were irradiated had no medial thickening when compared with control rats (at 5 Gy 0.22 +/- 0.02 mm2; at 10 Gy 0.21 +/- 0.02 mm2; at 15 Gy 0.22 +/- 0.07 mm2; with balloon injury/no radiation 0.37 +/- 0.03 mm2; p < 0.01). Endothelial regeneration, evaluated by transmission and scanning electron micrographs along with uptake of Evans blue dye, was significantly greater in animals that received radiation compared with controls.\nLow-dose radiation prevents the occurrence of neointimal hyperplasia after balloon injury and may have a future role in vascular grafting.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the combined insults of hemorrhagic shock and aortic clamping simulating ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair had a synergistic effect on the production of pulmonary injury, indicating remote organ injury.\nAnimals were randomized to one of three groups, infrarenal clamp plus 1 hour of shock, infrarenal clamp plus 2 hours of shock, and supramesenteric clamp plus 1 hour of shock. Each of these groups had four subgroups; sham, shock (mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg), clamp, or combined [shock plus clamp]). All animals had a laparotomy with aortic clamping in only the clamp and combined groups. Five hours after clamp removal lung permeability index and neutrophil sequestration were quantified.\nLung permeability index (6.60 +/- 0.63, p < 0.05 vs all other groups) and neutrophil sequestration (3.72 +/- 0.45 vs sham and clamp, p < 0.05) were significantly increased when shock and supramesenteric clamp were combined. After 1 or 2 hours of shock and infrarenal clamping, no increase in lung permeability index was noted, although neutrophil sequestration was increased in the 2-hour shock group.\nThese results demonstrate the additive effect of shock and supramesenteric clamping, which initiated a cascade of injurious events that resulted in a rapid pulmonary injury. The high mortality rate related to remote organ failure in ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm may be related to the synergy of these two injurious processes.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of a 67-year-old woman who was admitted for surgical removal of a Greenfield filter that had been inserted 7 years before because of recurrent deep vein thrombosis associated with pulmonary embolism. This complication appeared on a plain abdominal radiogram that showed a 7 cm distal migration of the filter, a 30-degree angulation, and rupture of a strut at the level of the hub. Computed tomography, aortography, and ascending cavography demonstrated that the inferior vena cava was perforated by the struts and that the ruptured strut had penetrated the infrarenal aorta. As demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, the fracture was due to a structural defect of the strut at its insertion point within the hub, with no sign of corrosion. Energy-dispersive radiography analysis failed to demonstrate impurity in the metal composition.",

    "abstract": "We report a series of four acute external iliac artery dissections occurring in three patients within days of completion of ultraendurance athletic events. Acute dissection of the external iliac artery in highly trained athletes after competition has not been previously documented. A retrospective review of three cases was performed with subsequent follow-up, including imaging and hemodynamic measurements. Dissection was suspected on the basis of duplex imaging results in one case, and arteriography confirmed dissection in all cases. All patients were endurance athletes over the age of 40 years. One patient was found to have bilateral lesions. Treatment in two cases was initiated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, one with a successful result and subsequent Plamaz stent placement. In the other case percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was unsuccessful, and operative repair was required with the placement of a graft. The final patient who had bilateral involvement was treated conservatively. At a mean follow-up of 32 months, there have been no complications, and all patients have normal resting hemodynamics. Follow-up duplex imaging shows healing of the dissections in the untreated patient. Histopathologic study in the patient treated with operation disclosed dissection in an otherwise normal arterial wall. Highly trained athletes over the age of 40 are susceptible to external iliac artery dissection, and successful treatment has been achieved by surgical, endovascular, and conservative therapies.",

Investigation revealed that the thoracic dissection probably had arisen retrogradely in the posterior wall of the AAA and extended superiorly to the left subclavian artery as a blind sac. Implantation of an endoluminal graft device below the renal arteries enabled simultaneous treatment of the AAA and the thoracic aortic dissection. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. Postoperative aortography and computed tomography demonstrated normal flow through the aorta and endograft without leak of contrast into the AAA sac or the false lumen of the dissection. Contrast computed tomography 6 months after operation demonstrated that the false lumen was no longer evident.",

    "abstract": "A case of true pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysm is reported. A calcified lesion was initially detected by plain x-ray films, and an essential diagnosis was made before operation by intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA). Surgical resection of the aneurysm was performed successfully. Additionally, we reviewed a total of 82 cases with PDA aneurysm out of the 88 cases that had been reported in the English-language literature up to 1993. Fifty-three cases were accompanied by aneurysmal rupture (rupture group), and 29, including our case, were without rupture (nonrupture group). Because of the high mortality rate (49.1%) in the rupture group, a precise diagnosis and adequate treatment of PDA aneurysm before rupture is important. In the nonrupture group, a calcification on radiography appeared in 61.6% of the cases in which aneurysms were not found incidentally; this seems to be a significant indication for angiography. Moreover, intravenous digital subtraction angiography is quite useful for the screening of PDA aneurysm because it is an easy and noninvasive examination.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) involves many factors; elastin degradation is believed to lead to initial dilation, whereas changes in the collagen structure predispose the aneurysm to rupture. The major collagens in the aortic wall are types I and III. We set out here to determine whether changes in serum propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), a biologically relevant marker of type III collagen turnover, could be associated with the characteristics of AAA.\nThe aminoterminal PIIINP and the carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen were measured by radioimmunoassay in 87 patients with AAA and 90 control subjects with aortodistal arteriosclerosis. The samples were taken from the peripheral blood and from the abdominal aorta at the levels of the diaphragm and the common iliac artery.\nMean PIIINP concentrations were higher in patients with AAA than in control subjects (3.47 micrograms/L vs 2.73 micrograms/L, p < 0.0001), correlating positively with aneurysm diameter in the former (r = 0.27, p = 0.04) and with the maximum thickness of the intraluminal thrombus (r = 0.39, p = 0.003). The gradient in PIIINP between the upper and lower end of the abdominal aorta was significant in the AAA group (-0.30 microgram/L, range -0.20 to -0.50 vs -0.10 micrograms/L, range -0.20 to 0.30, p = 0.002).\nThese studies indicate that the turnover of type III collagen is increased in patients with AAA.",

    "abstract": "Work posture and occupation are among the most controversial predisposing factors associated with venous disease. We examined the distribution and extent of venous reflux in the lower extremities of symptom-free vascular surgeons, who were typically classified as leading a life of prolonged standing, in comparison to a group of symptom-free volunteers.\nIn this prospective study (January 1991 to April 1994), the venous system in the lower limb veins of 28 vascular surgeons (56 limbs) and 25 normal volunteers (50 limbs) was examined by color-flow duplex imaging. The two groups were matched for age (29 to 45 years) and sex (all men). Subjects with clinical signs and symptoms of venous disease, history of deep or superficial vein thrombosis, or previous venous operation or injection sclerotherapy were not included in the study (12 vascular surgeons).\nVenous reflux was detected in 29 limbs of vascular surgeons (52%) and in 16 limbs of the control group (32%) (chi-squared test = 4.232, p = 0.039). In the latter, superficial venous incompetence was detected in 9 of 50 limbs (18%), deep venous or perforator incompetence in 3 of 50 limbs (6%), and venous incompetence involving both the superficial and deep systems in 4 of 50 limbs (8%). In the group of vascular surgeons, reflux in the superficial veins was seen in 22 of 56 limbs (39%), in the deep and or perforating veins in 4 of 56 limbs (7%), and in both the superficial and deep veins in 3 of 56 limbs (5%). Superficial venous reflux was more frequently encountered in the limbs of 45% of vascular surgeons (25 of 56) than in the limbs of the control subjects 26% (13 of 50) (chi-squared test = 3.99, p = 0.047). Distal long saphenous vein reflux alone accounted for 39% (5 of 13) of any superficial venous incompetence in the limbs of the control subjects, and was higher, at 48% (12/25), in the vascular surgeons. Reflux in the gastrocnemial veins was equally distributed between the limbs of the control subjects (10%) and the vascular surgeons (11%).\nVenous reflux was more frequently seen among symptom-free vascular surgeons than normal individuals of a nonmedical vocation. The superficial system was by far the most common site of venous incompetence in both groups. Below-knee-long saphenous vein reflux in any combination was present in more than 75% of the limbs with superficial venous incompetence.",

In the latter, superficial venous incompetence was detected in 9 of 50 limbs (18%), deep venous or perforator incompetence in 3 of 50 limbs (6%), and venous incompetence involving both the superficial and deep systems in 4 of 50 limbs (8%). In the group of vascular surgeons, reflux in the superficial veins was seen in 22 of 56 limbs (39%), in the deep and or perforating veins in 4 of 56 limbs (7%), and in both the superficial and deep veins in 3 of 56 limbs (5%). Superficial venous reflux was more frequently encountered in the limbs of 45% of vascular surgeons (25 of 56) than in the limbs of the control subjects 26% (13 of 50) (chi-squared test = 3.99, p = 0.047). Distal long saphenous vein reflux alone accounted for 39% (5 of 13) of any superficial venous incompetence in the limbs of the control subjects, and was higher, at 48% (12/25), in the vascular surgeons. Reflux in the gastrocnemial veins was equally distributed between the limbs of the control subjects (10%) and the vascular surgeons (11%).",

    "abstract": "Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia is characterized by smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, but its final form is predominantly extracellular matrix. The purpose of this study was to compare collagen synthesis from graft SMC to that from adjacent native arterial SMC.\nThoracoabdominal bypass grafts were excised 20 weeks after implantation into canine models. SMC harvested from six anastomotic graft segments and adjacent native aorta were passaged twice, grown to near-confluence, and then assayed for collagen synthesis and total protein synthesis. In four of these sites type I alpha-1 procollagen mRNA levels were measured and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. To control for increases in collagen synthesis associated with proliferation, SMC were plated at equal densities and tritium-thymidine incorporation and DNA concentration were determined. Data (mean +/- SE) were analyzed with two-factor ANOVA for repeated measures and paired Student t test and were considered significant if p < 0.05.\nThere was no difference in thymidine incorporation and total protein synthesis between groups, but collagen synthesis (graft: 52.9 +/- 1.6 disintegrations per minute/ng DNA versus native: 42.6 +/- 1.9 dpm/ng DNA; p = 0.03) and collagen synthesis as a percentage of total protein synthesis (graft: 7.16% +/- 0.11% versus native: 5.8% +/- 0.14%; p = 0.001) increased significantly in graft SMC as compared to native SMC. Type I alpha-1 procollagen mRNA levels were higher in graft SMC, but this difference was not significant.\nGraft SMC specifically produce more collagen than SMC from adjacent native artery. This change does not simply reflect increases in either total protein synthesis or proliferation and may, in part, be due to increased collagen gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial norepinephrine release has been associated with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension in human beings. To study this phenomenon under more controlled conditions, we studied the relationship of cerebral catecholamines and blood pressure in gerbils, whose cerebral circulation is similar to that in human beings.\nTwelve anesthetized gerbils underwent iliac artery blood pressure monitoring and in vivo electrochemistry catecholamine monitoring with use of catecholamine-specific electrodes placed stereotactically into the cerebral striatum. Six gerbils underwent 10 minutes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion (ischemic), whereas six underwent carotid artery dissection without occlusion (control).\nThe control group demonstrated a continuous gradual decline in blood pressure and striatal catecholamine during the 150-minute observation period. In contrast the ischemic gerbils demonstrated a sharp catecholamine rise during ischemia, a marked catecholamine drop shortly after carotid artery unclamping, and then a secondary larger catecholamine release that peaks in 60 minutes and gradually returns to baseline in 120 minutes. The blood pressure closely followed the catecholamine levels, with a sharp 20 mm Hg rise in blood pressure above baseline during carotid artery occlusion, followed by a dramatic 10 mm Hg drop below baseline after carotid artery unclamping and then a gradual rise of the blood pressure 25 mm Hg above baseline, which peaks in 80 minutes, with a gradual decline to the same blood pressure as in the control subjects 120 minutes after ischemia.\nWe conclude that striatal catecholamine release correlates with peripheral blood pressure during transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. This phenomenon may explain the mechanism of post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension in human beings, and this gerbil model can be used to study its prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "This report evaluates the efficiency of use of the lower extremity deep vein as arterial conduits in the autogenous repair of prosthetic infection after reconstructive aortoiliac surgery.\nWe reviewed our records for the period 1990 to 1994 of all patients with prosthetic infection after reconstruction for aortoiliac disease, and we selected for this study all those patients who underwent autograft repair with the lower extremity deep veins.\nIncluded were 15 patients: 12 had previously undergone direct aorto(ilio)femoral reconstruction, and three had an extraanatomic prosthetic graft. Thirteen patients were admitted with primary graft infection, and two were admitted with secondary graft-enteric erosion. Treatment consisted of prosthetic excision and aorto(ilio)femoral reconstruction with the superficial femoral vein. In situ reconstruction was performed in 12 cases. The operative mortality rate was 7%. There were no early graft occlusions. One patient underwent an above-knee amputation because of concomitant femoropopliteal occlusion in the presence of a patent deep venous aortofemoral graft. Early postoperative limb swelling was common and was controlled with bed rest, elastic stockings, or intermittent pneumatic compression. The mean follow-up of this series was 17 months (range 4 to 33 months). Two patients died of unrelated causes. One graft occluded after 16 months. There were no reinfections, and all but one patient resumed normal daily activities. Disability from removal of the deep veins was minimal: only one patient continues to wear elastic stockings for limb swelling and shows signs of venous hypertension more than 2 years after surgery.\nHarvesting of the lower extremity deep veins is well tolerated. Autogenous reconstruction with these veins provides good potential for salvage of life and limbs in case of prosthetic infection. A longer period of follow-up is required to study the long-term behavior of these grafts and to allow definite comparison with more conventional approaches.",

    "abstract": "Stainless steel endovascular stents are inherently thrombogenic so that thrombus accumulates on these devices, leading to acute vessel occlusion. A potential solution to this problem is stent surface modification with hydrophilic polymers, which might limit platelet adhesion and reactivity.\nN-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) and potassium sulfopropyl acrylate (KSPA) hydrophilic monomers were gamma graft polymerized onto 1 cm2 stainless steel slabs and 4 mm Palmaz stainless steel stents. Surface characteristics of modified and plain stainless steel stents were then investigated with contact angle and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and in vitro and in vivo platelet reactivity was assessed as 111Indium platelet accumulation expressed as counts/min/cm2.\nSurface modification of stainless steel slabs and stents with both NVP and KSPA hydrophilic polymers significantly reduced in vitro platelet adhesion (plain = 2249 +/- 723 counts/min/cm2, NVP = 428 +/- 156 counts/min/cm2, KSPA = 958 +/- 223 counts/min/cm2) and in vivo platelet accumulation after 1 hour of blood flow exposure (plain = 1407 +/- 796 counts/min/cm2, NVP = 426 +/- 175 counts/min/cm2, KSPA = 399 +/- 124 counts/min/cm2. In addition, platelet accumulation on modified stents indexed to plain stents was lowest in KSPA-modified stents (NVP = 79.3% +/- 31.7% of plain, KSPA = 51.2% +/- 36.2% of plain).

    "abstract": "Occlusive disease of the aortoiliac segment may lead to limb-threatening ischemia, if coexisting disease is present in the femoral, popliteal, or tibial arteries. The combined treatment of severe aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease with standard techniques may be hazardous or contraindicated in patients with multiple previous reconstructions, severe comorbid medical illnesses, or both. This report summarizes the technical feasibility and early results of aortoiliac endovascular stented grafts (ESGs) in combination with conventional surgical reconstructions for the treatment of multilevel arterial occlusive disease.\nSeventeen patients with multilevel aortoiliofemoral limb-threatening occlusive disease had an ESG inserted to treat long-segment occlusive disease followed by a conventional surgical bypass. ESGs originated from the aortoiliac junction (seven) or the common iliac artery (10) and were inserted into the common femoral (nine), superficial femoral (four), or deep femoral (four) artery. ESG lengths ranged from 16 to 30 cm (mean, 21 cm). Conventional surgical bypasses were constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene (15) or saphenous vein (two) and extended to the popliteal (12), tibial (two), or contralateral femoral (three) arteries.\nTechnical success in graft insertion was achieved in 17 (94%) of 18 attempted ESG procedures. The 1-year primary and secondary cumulative patency rates for ESGs were 94% +/- 10% and 100%, respectively, whereas the 1- and 2-year patency rates for the extravascular grafts were 92% +/- 10% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had minor postprocedure complications (23%), and no deaths occurred. One patient lost his limb at 16 months because of severe pedal sepsis.\nTransluminally placed stented grafts in combination with conventional surgical infrainguinal bypasses are a technically feasible and potentially safe option for the treatment of limb-threatening aortoiliofemoral occlusive disease and have demonstrated encouraging early patency. Long-term follow-up will be necessary before widespread application of this technique is advocated.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop an aortic aneurysm (AA) model with a predictable tendency for rupture for the evaluation of the efficacy of endovascular prostheses in preventing rupture and their long-term outcome after implantation.\nAn infrarenal AA measuring two to three times the diameter of the proximal aorta was created in 18 dogs with a full-thickness patch of jejunum. Seven dogs were allowed to survive without aneurysm exclusion. In 11 dogs the aneurysm was immediately excluded with a stented 8 mm Dacron graft mounted in a 14F delivery system introduced through the femoral artery with aortographic guidance. The pressure differential between the aorta and the excluded aneurysm was measured, and angiography, necropsy, and histologic examination were performed at 3- and 6-month survival.\nAll animals survived aneurysm implantation. Without aneurysm exclusion, six dogs died of rupture within 1 to 6 days of surgery. In three dogs the exclusion failed because of graft-to-aorta size mismatch or misplacement demonstrated on angiography and by a low pressure differential between the aorta and the aneurysm (< 5 mm Hg); all three dogs died of rupture within 4 days. In eight dogs the aneurysm was successfully excluded on the basis of angiography results, with a mean aorta-to-aneurysm pressure differential of 51 mm Hg. Two dogs were killed at 1 and 6 days after surgery because of paraplegia produced by graft thrombosis because of kinking but without evidence of aneurysm rupture. Six dogs survived on a long-term basis, and angiography and necropsy performed at 3 and 6 months revealed patent grafts without migration, reduction in aneurysm size, no flow in the excluded lumbar arteries in five of six animals, and complete incorporation of Dacron graft and stents. No evidence of graft infection was found in any animal. The survival rate was significantly better (p < 0.023) in dogs with successfully excluded aneurysms (n = 6) compared with that in dogs without exclusion or with failed aneurysm exclusion (n = 7).\nThis aneurysm model demonstrates that without effective aneurysm exclusion all animals die of rupture and that successfully placed endovascular prostheses can prevent AA rupture with long-term graft patency and stability. Endovascular aortic Dacron grafts in dogs undergo complete incorporation at 3 months from implantation. This aneurysm model is useful for the evaluation of endovascular devices designed for the treatment of AAs.",

Alteration in expression of MMP-2 or its inhibitor, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases type two (TIMP-2), could increase extracellular matrix degradation and lead to aneurysm formation. The purpose of this study is (1) to measure relative tissue levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNA in aneurysmal, occlusive, and normal human infrarenal aorta; (2) to test for expression by cultured aneurysmal and normal vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); and (3) to identify, in situ, the cells responsible for mRNA production within aneurysmal, occlusive, and normal aortic wall.\nTotal RNA extracted from aneurysmal (n = 8), occlusive (n = 9), and normal (n = 7) tissue was subjected to Northern analysis. Signals for MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were normalized to alpha-tubulin. Mean values +/- SE were compared by use of analysis of variance. Aneurysmal and normal VSMCs were cultured, passaged, and grown to confluence before RNA extraction and Northern analysis. In situ hybridization with digoxigenin RNA probes localized cells responsible for MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNA production in histologic sections of aneurysmal (n = 7), occlusive (n = 4), and normal (n = 3) aorta.\nTissue MMP-2 mRNA levels were significantly greater in aneurysmal aorta (1.032 +/- 0.164, n = 5) than in either occlusive (0.553 +/- 0.027, n = 4, p < 0.02) or normal aorta (0.230 +/- 0.038, n = 3, p < 0.002). Differences in TIMP-2 mRNA levels were not significant (aneurysmal aorta 0.207 +/- 0.042, n = 3; occlusive aorta 0.413 +/- 0.164, n = 3; normal aorta 0.260 +/- 0.079, n = 4; p = 0.34), although numbers were small. Cultured aneurysmal and normal VSMCs constitutively expressed both MMP-2 and TIMP-2. In situ studies colocalized tissue MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expression to VSMCs and macrophages surrounding inflammation in aneurysmal adventita, but to atherosclerotic plaque in occlusive aorta.\nMMP-2 and TIMP-2 are expressed in aneurysmal, occlusive, and normal aorta. MMP-2 expression is significantly greater in aneurysmal than in either occlusive or normal aorta. Cultured aneurysmal VSMCs constitutively express both MMP-2 and TIMP-2. Differential patterns of expression seen in situ and elevated tissue MMP-2 mRNA levels in aneurysmal versus occlusive aorta suggest that MMP-2 may be responsible for localized plaque remodeling in occlusive disease and for diffuse adventitial collagen and elastin destruction in aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that cardiac complications (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, fatal arrhythmias) are no longer the leading cause of death after elective aortic reconstructions.\nThe medical records of all elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions performed between January 1982 and June 1994 were retrospectively reviewed. All perioperative deaths were analyzed to determine the cause of death and were compared with a subset of 266 survivors to identify any associated preoperative or intraoperative factors.\nSeven hundred twenty-two aortic reconstructions were performed for aneurysmal or occlusive disease, and there were 44 deaths (overall mortality rate of 6.1%). The mortality rate after aortic reconstruction alone was 4.9% and increased with the addition of renal (8.9%, p = 0.16) or lower extremity vascular procedures (15.8%, p = 0.01). Multisystem organ failure (MSOF) was the cause of death in 56.8%, of the patients (3.5% overall mortality rate) followed by cardiac events in 25% (1.5% overall mortality rate). Visceral organ dysfunction was the most common cause of MSOF leading to death in 14 patients (56.0%), and postoperative pneumonia was responsible for the fatal MSOF in nine patients (36.0%). Patient age, history of myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure, ejection fraction less than 50%, duration of operative time, and performance of additional procedures were associated with increased operative mortality rates by multivariate analysis.\nMSOF, predominantly from visceral organ dysfunction, was the leading cause of death after elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction. The risk of MSOF and operative death increases with the complexity of the procedure and the number of comorbid conditions.",

Multisystem organ failure (MSOF) was the cause of death in 56.8%, of the patients (3.5% overall mortality rate) followed by cardiac events in 25% (1.5% overall mortality rate). Visceral organ dysfunction was the most common cause of MSOF leading to death in 14 patients (56.0%), and postoperative pneumonia was responsible for the fatal MSOF in nine patients (36.0%). Patient age, history of myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure, ejection fraction less than 50%, duration of operative time, and performance of additional procedures were associated with increased operative mortality rates by multivariate analysis.",

    "abstract": "This report ascertained factors responsible for for failure of foot salvage in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after undergoing infrainguinal bypass for critical ischemia.\nA retrospective review of 69 distal arterial reconstructions performed in 53 patients with ESRD (hemodialysis [n = 37], kidney transplantation [n = 10], peritoneal dialysis [n = 6]) for foot gangrene (n = 28), nonhealing ulcer (n = 25), or ischemic rest pain (n = 16) was conducted. Endpoints of surgical morbidity, limb loss, and graft patency were correlated with extent of preoperative tissue loss and presence of diabetes mellitus.\nThe 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the patient survival rate at 2 years was 38%. The primary graft patency rate was 96% at 30 days, 72% at 1 year, and 68% at 2 years. Eleven of 22 foot amputations performed during the mean follow-up period of 14 months (range 3 to 96 months) occurred within 2 months of revascularization. Mechanisms responsible for limb loss included graft failure (n = 9), foot ischemia despite a patent bypass (n = 8), and uncontrolled infection (n = 5). Overall, 59% of amputations were performed in limbs with a patent bypass to popliteal or tibial arteries. Healing of forefoot amputations was prolonged, but all limb loss beyond 9 months of revascularization was due to graft failure. The limb salvage rate at 1 year decreased (p = 0.13) from 74% to 51% in patients admitted with gangrene. Only two of seven patients admitted with forefoot gangrene experienced foot salvage.\nFailure of foot salvage in patients with ESRD and critical ischemia was due to wound healing problems rather than graft thrombosis. Earlier referral for revascularization, before development of extensive tissue ischemia and infection, is recommended. Primary amputation should be considered in patients admitted with forefoot gangrene, particularly if it is complicated by infection.",

    "abstract": "No single method has been identified that accurately and reliably detects patients with impending bowel infarction during aortic reconstruction. Serial sampling of blood gas from the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) for detecting colonic ischemia was compared with two previously described techniques: laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and photoplethysmography.\nNine dogs underwent induced partial colonic ischemia followed by complete ischemia. Serial IMV blood gas measurements were obtained at four intervals: baseline, partial ischemia, complete ischemia, and reperfusion. Simultaneous direct colon wall LDF and PPG measurements also were obtained.\nChanges in pH, Po2, O2 saturation, and Pco2 demonstrated progressive acidosis, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia in association with progressive arterial occlusion and a reversal of these trends toward baseline after restoration of flow. The absence of a pulsatile photoplethysmography tracing and oxygen saturation less than 90% were predictive of altered perfusion but could not differentiate partial from complete ischemia. Although the differences in mean LDF values were statistically different during ischemia and reperfusion, there was considerable variability between each measurement.\nAnalysis of blood gas from the IMV and pulse oximetry are useful techniques for detecting colonic ischemia, but only the former can distinguish partial from complete ischemia. The variability in colonic measurements with LDF limits its usefulness for detecting levels of colonic perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative neurologic injury remains a significant risk of carotid endarterectomy. Mechanisms include embolization of debris and formation of thrombus on the newly endarterectomized surface. We hypothesized that the risk of postoperative neurologic injury would be lower in those patients who did not receive protamine for reversal of heparin anticoagulation.\nWe reviewed 348 consecutive primary carotid endarterectomies performed since January 1, 1986, to determine the relationship between surgical outcomes and reversal of heparin anticoagulation. Patients undergoing additional simultaneous cardiovascular procedures were excluded. One hundred ninety-three patients received protamine after completion of the endarterectomy. The remaining 155 patients did not receive any protamine.\nAll patients in both groups survived to discharge. There were no strokes in those patients who did not receive any protamine; however, the stroke rate in the protamine group was 2.6% (5 of 193), p < 0.045. The incidence of hematoma requiring reexploration was 1.0% (2 of 193) and 1.9% (3 of 155) in the protamine and no-protamine groups, respectively (p = NS). Intraoperative shunting was used more frequently in the no-protamine group (84% vs 67%, p < 0.001), and patch angioplasty was performed more frequently in the protamine group (35% vs 15%, p < 0.001). However, neither shunting nor patching significantly influenced stroke rates.\nWe conclude that carotid endarterectomy without reversal of heparin anticoagulation is associated with a reduced postoperative stroke rate without a significant increase in morbidity rates.",

    "abstract": "Kinks and coils of the extracranial carotid artery system have been described in conjunction with atherosclerotic disease of the internal carotid artery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether adding a carotid artery shortening procedure to carotid endarterectomy affected perioperative mortality and stroke-morbidity rates or late restenosis.\nA retrospective chart review of all patients who concurrently underwent carotid endarterectomy and ipsilateral carotid artery shortening between 1983 and 1992 was performed. Long-term follow-up was obtained by contacting the primary physician or patient, and carotid artery duplex scans were obtained.\nOne hundred seven patients were found to have undergone concurrent carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery shortening. The age range was 47 to 89 years, with 53 female and 54 male patients. Indications for surgery in this group were transient ischemic attacks in 28%, stroke in 18%, amaurosis fugax in 7%, and high-grade asymptomatic stenosis in 47%. Shortening procedures were performed by use of a variety of techniques at the completion of endarterectomy. The combined 30-day mortality and stroke morbidity rate was 2.7%, with two postoperative deaths and one stroke. In this same period, a total of 1072 carotid endarterectomies were performed, and the combined 30-day mortality and stroke morbidity rate was 4.0%. During late follow-up there were no ipsilateral strokes, recurrent symptoms, or significant restenoses.\nThis experience suggests that the addition of a shortening procedure to carotid endarterectomy can be performed without increased morbidity and mortality rates and, when deemed appropriate, is a procedure with which the vascular surgeon should be familiar.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we designed and characterized a novel polytetrafluoroethylene-based local drug delivery device that selectively concentrates infused pharmacologic agents specifically within those blood layers adjacent to the graft wall and at downstream anastomotic sites. In this study we locally administered heparin with this approach and evaluated its effect on graft patency and neointimal hyperplasia formation in a rabbit model of inferior vena cava replacement.\nTwelve animals were evenly assigned either to a control group infused with saline solution or to a treatment group infused with heparin for 14 days. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling was used to assess vascular cell proliferation.\nAll grafts in the control group were occluded at 14 days. All grafts in the heparin-treated group remained patent, although there was no significant difference in systemic activated partial thromboplastin time measurements taken before and during the infusion of heparin (p > 0.5). In the treatment group, heparin reduced neointimal thickness, neointimal area, and the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index by 88%, 95%, and 72%, respectively (p < 0.01), at the locally treated downstream anastomosis as compared with the untreated upstream anastomosis.\nThese data demonstrate that the local boundary layer infusion of heparin significantly increases overall inferior vena cava graft patency (p = 0.014) and markedly reduces downstream anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation. This approach may represent an attractive strategy for antithrombotic therapy in venous replacement with synthetic graft materials.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolus (PE) remains a major factor in morbidity and death in severely injured patients, especially those in specific high-risk groups. PEs have been documented to occur despite routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic Greenfield filter (PGF) placement in patients who have multiple trauma with known high-risk injuries for PE.\nFrom January 1992 to June 1994, PGF were prospectively placed in 108 patients who had an injury severity score greater than 9 and met one of the following criteria: (1) severe head injury with prolonged ventilator dependence, (2) severe head injury with multiple lower extremity fractures, (3) spinal cord injury with or without paralysis, (4) major abdominal or pelvic penetrating venous injury, (5) pelvic fracture with lower extremity fractures. These patients were compared with 216 patients, historically matched for age, sex, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, and days in the intensive care unit. Data analysis was done with chi-squared and Student's t testing.\nThere were no statistical differences between the PGF and control group with regard to age (35.9 +/- 1.5 vs 38.3 +/- 1.4), sex (male 76% vs 75.5%), days in the intensive care unit (21.2 +/- 1.4 vs 18.1 +/- 1.5), ISS (28.0 +/- 1.0 vs 25.4 +/- 0.8) and mechanism of injury (blunt 85% vs 81%). None of the patients in the PGF group had a PE. In the control group, however, 13 patients had a PE, nine of which were fatal. These differences were statistically significant for both PE (p < 0.009) and PE-related death (p < 0.03). The overall mortality rate was reduced in the PGF group (18 of 108, 16%) versus the control group (47 of 216, 22%); however, this did not achieve statistical significance.\nPGF insertion in selected patients at high risk who had trauma effectively prevented both fatal and nonfatal PE. The lower incidence of fatal PE in the PGF group may have contributed to a reduction in the overall mortality rate. Patients who have trauma with high risk for PE should be considered for PGF placement.",

SCA stenosis (n = 27) was associated with upper extremity claudication (55%), vertebrobasilar insufficiency (15%), or both (30%). CCA stenosis (n = 14) was accompanied by hemispheric symptoms in 86% and global ischemia in 14%, whereas INA stenosis (n = 3) was associated with transient ischemic attacks (67%) and right arm ischemia (33%).\nSCA revascularization included carotid-subclavian or carotid-axillary bypass (n = 19), axilloaxillary bypass (n = 8), and subclavian-carotid transposition (n = 3). CCA reconstructions included subclavian-carotid (SC) bypass (n = 13) and carotid-carotid bypass (n = 1). INA procedures included three axilloaxillary bypasses. Six patients had an associated carotid endarterectomy, and three underwent concomitant vertebral artery transpositions. Intraluminal shunts were not routinely used. Vein was used as a conduit in five procedures, and a prosthetic graft (23 Dacron, 16 polytetrafluoroethlyene) was used in the remainder. The average postoperative intensive care unit and hospital and hospital stay were 1 and 5 days, respectively. Follow-up was available in 43 of 44 patients (mean = 26.2 months).

From histologic and angiographic appearance, FMD was classified with regard to specific type, noting the presence of RA dissections, RA macroaneurysms and branch RA involvement. Associations between blood pressure response to operation and patient age, duration of hypertension, presence of extrarenal atherosclerosis, presence of branch renal artery disease, and primary or secondary procedure were examined. Clinical characteristics and blood pressure response in these contemporary patients were compared with the results reported from an earlier surgical series.\nUnilateral RA repair was performed in 34 patients, and bilateral procedures were required in six patients. Branch renal artery repair was performed in 28 instances, including ex vivo RA repair in 11 patients. There were no perioperative or follow-up deaths; however, three RA grafts (7%) failed within 30 days of operation. Initial blood pressure response was considered cured in 33%, improved in 57%, and failed in 10%. Analysis demonstrated that patients older than 45 years of age had a significantly decreased rate of hypertension cure compared with younger patients; among patients younger than 45 years of age, duration of hypertension was inversely related to cure. Compared with earlier surgical series, our current group of patients was significantly older, with more frequent branch renal artery involvement and extrarenal atherosclerosis, and demonstrated decreased rate of hypertension cure.\nA beneficial blood pressure response is currently observed in most selected patients after surgical correction of RA-FMD.

Initial axillobifemoral bypass was followed by removal of the patient's aortic graft and retroperitoneal drainage. After 3 years the patient is without evidence of recurrent infection or tumor. This case report consists of a known instance of C. septicum infection of an aortic graft.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that lower extremity transcutaneous oxygen (TcPO2) measurements can accurately predict severity of foot ischemia and can be used to select appropriate treatment (conservative versus operative) for patients with diabetes and tissue necrosis or ischemic rest pain.\nFifty-five patients with 66 limbs were prospectively treated from June 1993 to July 1994. Noninvasive hemodynamic arterial assessment and TcPO2 mapping of the involved limb were obtained before treatment was selected. If the transmetatarsal TcPO2 level was 30 mm Hg or greater, the patient's foot problem was managed conservatively with local wound care, debridement, or a minor foot amputation. If the transmetatarsal TcPO2 level was less than 30 mm Hg, arteriography was performed with the anticipated need for vascular reconstruction. The endpoints for determining treatment success or failure were complete wound healing or relief of ischemic rest pain.\nThirty-one of 36 (86%) limbs with an initial transmetatarsal TcPO2 level of 30 mm Hg or greater were treated successfully with conservative care, including 73% (11 of 15 feet) of limbs without a palpable pedal pulse. After either bypass or angioplasty, 20 of 24 (83%) limbs achieved a transmetatarsal TcPO2 level greater than 30 mm Hg and had complete resolution of their presenting foot problem. An initial or postintervention transmetatarsal TcPO2 level of 30 mm Hg or greater was more accurate (90%, p = 0.001) than a palpable pedal pulse (65%, p = 0.009), in predicting ultimate wound healing or resolution of rest pain.\nTcPO2 mapping is a useful noninvasive modality that can prospectively determine severity of foot ischemia, aid in selecting appropriate treatment for patients with diabetes and foot salvage problems, and decrease the total cost of such care.",

    "abstract": "Optimal duration of postoperative duplex surveillance of infrainguinal vein grafts is not known. Previous reports have suggested nearly all vein graft stenoses are present within the first postoperative year, and normal duplex examination results during this time eliminate the need for ongoing graft surveillance. To determine whether surveillance may be safely discontinued in patients with normal early postoperative surveillance studies, we reviewed the color-flow surveillance examinations in our patients who underwent infrainguinal reverse vein graft revisions during a 4 1/2 year period.\nClinical and vascular laboratory records were reviewed of all patients who underwent infrainguinal reverse vein bypass grafting followed by subsequent graft revision for a duplex scanning-detected abnormality at our institution between January 1990 and July 1994.\nOf 447 infrainguinal reverse vein bypasses performed, 36 (8.1%) underwent surgical revision as a result of an abnormal finding during routine duplex surveillance. The initial postoperative duplex examination was obtained within 2 weeks of graft implantation in 23 (64%) patients, between 2 weeks and 3 months in 10 (28%) patients, and between 3 and 6 months in three (8%) patients. Duplex abnormalities prompting revision included 11 (31%) grafts with a mid-graft peak systolic velocity (PSV) < or = 45 cm/sec, 23 (64%) grafts with a focal PSV > or = 200 cm/sec, one graft with a PSV > or = 150 cm/sec but < 200 cm/sec, and one thought to be occluded by duplex but found to be patent by angiography. Abnormal duplex findings were initially detected within 2 weeks of graft implantation in five (14%) patients, between 2 weeks and 3 months in eight (22%) patients, from 3 to 6 months in 12 (33%) patients, from 6 to 12 months in six (17%) patients, and > 1 year in five (14%) patients. In only 25% of cases were mid-graft PSVs < or = 45 cm/sec or focal velocities > or = 200 cm/sec identified on the initial examination; 75% were found during subsequent surveillance.\nAlthough most reverse vein graft abnormalities detected by duplex surveillance and prompting graft revision appear within the first postoperative year, many are not detected on the initial examination. In our recent experience 31% of duplex abnormalities leading to vein graft revision were first detected more than 6 months after operation. Discontinuation of graft surveillance based on normal early findings will result in thrombosis of some vein grafts that may otherwise be salvaged.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to determine the time of onset, location, severity, rate of progression, and subsequent fate of infrainguinal vein graft lesions.\nSixty-one infrainguinal vein grafts were studied serially with duplex ultrasonography to document the location and severity of each lesion. Grafts were studied at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months and then annually.\nThe cumulative secondary graft patency rate at 3 years (life-table analysis) was 93.2%. A total of 158 lesions were detected in 55 of the 61 grafts studied. The degree of diameter reduction at the time of initial detection was as follows: 1% to 19% (29.6%), 20% to 49% (51.0%), 50% to 75% (17.3%), and greater than 75% (3.1%). Forty-eight percent were detected at the first examination, 59.2% within 2 months, and 85.7% within 6 months. Progression was detected in 31.2% of the lesions by 6 and in 39.1% of the lesions by 18 months (life-table analysis). Thrombosis, in the absence of significant changes in ankle-brachial index (> or = 0.15) or return of symptoms, was not observed in grafts that had lesions with less than 75% diameter reduction.\nThe data support the performance of a duplex scan either during surgery or before discharge from the hospital in addition to frequent surveillance for the first 6 months. Frequent surveillance is appropriate for lesions with less than 75% diameter reduction as long as they remain asymptomatic and without a significant reduction in the ankle-brachial index.",

Duplex scanning or angiography were used to determine progression in 150 patients after they underwent revascularization for AOD.\nFollow-up studies were compared with presurgical arteriograms. Superficial femoral (SFA) and popliteal arteries were graded as less than 50% stenosis, 50% to 99% stenosis, or occluded. Tibial arteries were graded with regard to whether they were continuously patent from the popliteal trifurcation to the ankle. Progression was defined as an increase in one stenosis category.\nAt a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 18% of native arteries, 39% of extremities, and 52% of patients demonstrated progression of AOD. Overall, 21% of arteries in patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass and 14% of arteries in patients undergoing suprainguinal bypass demonstrated progression (p = 0.004). Progression was more frequently detected in examinations performed more than 4 years after baseline arteriography (66%) than in examinations performed 6 months to 2 years (45%, p = 0.032) or 2 to 4 years (44%, p = 0.029) after baseline arteriography. Thirty percent of SFAs demonstrated progression, and 32% with 50% stenosis or greater at baseline became occluded. There was no difference in SFA, popliteal, or tibial artery progression in revascularized versus nonrevascularized extremities after suprainguinal bypass. There was no difference in tibial artery progression in operated and nonoperated limbs after femoropopliteal artery bypass.\nAOD progression occurs frequently in patients requiring revascularization and is more prevalent in patients requiring femoropopliteal than in patients requiring suprainguinal bypass.

Two were known to have ET; in three others ET was diagnosed after operation when platelet counts persistently in excess of 500,000/mm3 were noted. The diagnosis of ET was established in each case by ruling out causes of reactive thrombocytosis and (in the three new cases) by evidence for megakaryocyte hyperplasia on bone marrow biopsy. Platelet counts in all five patients were reduced to normal levels by cytoreductive therapy, and no further thrombotic episodes have occurred during 18 months (mean) of follow-up. During this 2-year period ET accounted for more large-vessel thrombotic complications in our institutions than all other more frequently described hypercoagulable states combined.\nET is an underemphasized cause of large-vessel thrombosis.",

The diagnosis of ET was established in each case by ruling out causes of reactive thrombocytosis and (in the three new cases) by evidence for megakaryocyte hyperplasia on bone marrow biopsy. Platelet counts in all five patients were reduced to normal levels by cytoreductive therapy, and no further thrombotic episodes have occurred during 18 months (mean) of follow-up. During this 2-year period ET accounted for more large-vessel thrombotic complications in our institutions than all other more frequently described hypercoagulable states combined.",

    "abstract": "Retrospective reviews suggest that the progression of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) may be accelerated in heart transplant recipients. This study was undertaken to determine the incidence and to identify those risk factors that may be associated with the development or progression of PVD in these patients.\nBetween January 1990 and December 1993 a prospective vascular screening protocol including abdominal ultrasonography, Doppler-derived ankel-brachial pressure indexes (ABI), and carotid artery duplex imaging was added to the routine preoperative and annual postoperative evaluation of 239 heart transplant recipients.\nThirty-one significant vascular lesions were detected in 10% (24 of 239) of patients 52 +/- 9 years of age at a mean of 3.2 years after transplant. The distribution of lesions included carotid artery stenosis (11), femoropopliteal occlusive disease (10), aortoiliac occlusive disease (five), aortic aneurysm (four), and renal artery stenosis in one patient. Revascularization procedures were performed in 12 (50%) patients (carotid endarterectomy (four), aortobifemoral bypass grafting (three), abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (two), transluminal angioplasty (two), splenorenal bypass (one), and femorotibial bypass grafting (one)). One patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) was found to have noncompressible vessels during pretransplant evaluation. An additional 26 patients (11%), seven with DM, had noncompressible vessels in the lower extremities during the follow-up period. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the development of posttransplant PVD was associated with smoking (p < 0.05) and ischemic cardiomyopathy as an indication for transplantation (p < 0.05). The development of noncompressible vessels was associated with younger age (p < 0.05) and the presence of diabetes (p < 0.05).\nPosttransplant peripheral vascular disease occurred in 10% of heart transplant recipients and is associated with pretransplant ischemic cardiomyopathy and smoking. A previously unrecognized subgroup of patients who have noncompressible vessels after operation is described. If the long-term survival of the heart transplant recipient is to be improved, routine follow-up to identify and treat those patients at greater risk appears justified.",

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic femoral pseudoaneurysms (IFP) have traditionally been treated surgically. Recently, this common problem has been successfully treated without operation by use of ultrasound-guided compression (UGC) to induce thrombosis of the false aneurysm cavity, but the risk factors for failure and the long-term outcome have not been defined.\nAll patients referred to the vascular laboratory from June 1992 to November 1994 whose femoral pseudoaneurysms were treated by UGC were included in the study. Data were collected prospectively during the last 18 months of the study. Data regarding the location and morphologic characteristics of the pseudoaneurysms and anticoagulation status were documented. Patients who had successful UGC underwent follow-up duplex scanning and ankle-brachial arterial pressure evaluations.\nFifty-seven patients with IFP were treated with UGC over a 30-month period; the last 34 were evaluated prospectively. UGC was successful at obliterating the false aneurysm cavity with the initial attempt in 47 (83%). Thrombosis of seven additional pseudoaneurysms was achieved on subsequent UGC attempts for an overall success rate of 95%. Recurrent false aneurysms were noted in two patients 2 and 10 days after initially successful UGC. Both were treated successfully with repeat UGC. Multivariate analysis of 14 variables revealed heparin anticoagulation (chi-square 9.025, p = 0.001) as the only significant risk factor for failure of UGC. There were no episodes of arterial thrombosis, embolization, or femoral nerve injury associated with UGC. Temporary occlusion of femoral artery during UGC and compression intervals of 20 minutes were well tolerated. Long-term follow-up from 30 to 400 days after UGC was available in 36 patients. There was no late recurrence or significant change in ankle-brachial pressures (p > 0.05).\nUGC is a safe and effective treatment for most catheter-induced femoral pseudoaneurysms with a low complication rate and excellent long-term results at a cost substantially lower than operative treatment. Because the natural history of IFP is unpredictable, UGC appears to be the preferred treatment for all IFPs persisting after cessation of heparin anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) during noninvasive lower extremity arterial examination in the vascular laboratory.\nOver 30 months we screened 531 patients who underwent lower extremity arterial evaluations in the vascular laboratory. The patients had fasted overnight, and, after the regular noninvasive lower extremity arterial examination, the abdominal aorta was screened with B-mode ultrasonography.\nThe aorta was adequately visualized in 475 patients (89%). Mean aortic diameter was 19.6 +/- 4.1 mm at the juxtarenal level and 18.8 +/- 7.2 mm in the lower infrarenal aorta. The aortic diameter was larger in men (p < 0.001) and in smokers (p < 0.001). AAA (diameter greater than 3.0 cm) were identified in 32 patients (6.0% of the 531 patients screened), and 15 of the aneurysms were equal to or larger than 4.0 cm. The best predictors for AAA by logistic regression analysis were male sex (p < 0.005), advanced age (greater than 65 years, p < 0.01), and a history of smoking (p < 0.01). The prevalence of AAA was 6.7% (32/475) in the population in whom the aorta was visualized and 15.2% (19/125) in male smokers over 65 years of age. Aneurysms of 4.0 cm or greater were identified in 3.2% of the entire population screened and 8.8% of male smokers over age 65. Limited aortic scanning prolonged the vascular laboratory examination by an average of 5 minutes. Thus detection of one aneurysm required 83 minutes of scanning time for the whole population studied and 36 minutes of scanning of male smokers over age 65, at a cost of $240 to $553 per aneurysm identified.\nScreening for AAA during lower extremity arterial evaluation in the vascular laboratory addresses a high-risk population, is cost-effective, and should be considered an appropriate and valuable addition to the examination protocol.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have attempted to determine the incidence and mortality rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms in a variety of populations; however, the incidence of iliac, femoral, and popliteal artery aneurysms have not been established. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of lower extremity aneurysms in hospitalized patients in the state of Utah, which has a population at low risk for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and smoking, and to compare the results with the incidence in the United States.\nIncidences of iliac, femoral, and popliteal artery aneurysm in Utah were determined over a 6-year period, with data obtained via diagnostic codes from the Utah Hospital Association. The incidence of iliac, femoral, and popliteal artery aneurysms in the United States hospital population was calculated by use of National Hospital Discharge Summary 1990 data, a complex sample of nonfederal short-stay hospitals in the United States, which provides the most comprehensive database of health statistics in the United States.\nThe incidence of iliac femoral/popliteal artery aneurysms in hospitalized Utah men is 3.76 and 4.85 per 100,000 population, respectively. In American men, iliac and femoral/popliteal artery aneurysm incidences are 6.58 and 7.39 per 100,000 population, respectively. Incidences among hospitalized women in Utah are 0.24 and 1.07 per 100,000; incidences in women in the United States are 0.26 and 1.00 per 100,000, respectively. The incidence of nonaortic peripheral aneurysms among hospitalized patients in Utah is lower than in the United States. The rate ratios (Utah/United States) for incidences of iliac, femoral, and popliteal artery aneurysms in men are 0.57 and 0.66, respectively (p < 0.05). No statistical difference is seen between incidences in women in Utah and the United States (p > 0.05)-ratios of 0.93 and 1.06, respectively.\nThis study validates the traditional belief that iliac, femoral, and popliteal artery aneurysms are much less frequent, at least in hospitalized patients, than previously published incidences of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Revascularization for the treatment of aortic graft infection is usually accomplished by remote prosthetic axillofemoral bypass combined with cross-femoral bypass. When infection at the femoral level precludes placement of a prosthetic cross-femoral graft, we have used a variety of autogenous tissue conduits to restore circulation to the contralateral leg. To determine which of these conduits offers the most durable reconstruction, we have reviewed 78 patients treated for aortic graft infection.\nBetween 1980 and 1991 we used either autogenous saphenous vein (ASV, n = 34), endarterectomized superficial femoral artery (SFA, n = 14), or direct ilioiliac anastomosis (iliac, n = 10) to provide cross-femoral flow. We compared the performance of these tissue conduits with a concurrent patient group with aortic graft infection in whom a prosthetic cross-femoral graft was used (prosthetic, n = 20).\nFollow-up was available for 98.7% of patients, average 3.8 +/- 2.9 years, and was not different between the four groups. Bleeding complications occurred exclusively in the ASV group (n = 3, 8.8%) and were all in the perioperative period. In addition one ASV and one iliac conduit developed multiple false aneurysms. Hemodynamic conduit failure (thrombosis or stenosis) occurred in nine (26.5%) ASV conduits, six (42.8%) SFA conduits, and one iliac conduit, but not in the prosthetic group. When all of these adverse events were combined for each conduit group, both ASV and SFA conduits had a higher rate of conduit failure when compared with the prosthetic conduits (p < 0.05, log-rank test). Limb loss resulting from cross-femoral conduit failure occurred in six (17.6%) patients in the ASV group, four (28.6%) patients in the SFA group, and one patient each in the iliac and prosthetic groups. These differences were not significant.\nWe conclude that ASV and SFA conduits do not provide stable long-term cross-femoral revascularization and should be regarded as bridge grains until femoral infection is eradicated. When femoral infection mandates their use, frequent postoperative conduit surveillance is required. If ASV or SFA caliber is marginal, consideration should be given to the use of a larger autogenous conduit, such as superficial femoral vein.",

Hemodynamic conduit failure (thrombosis or stenosis) occurred in nine (26.5%) ASV conduits, six (42.8%) SFA conduits, and one iliac conduit, but not in the prosthetic group. When all of these adverse events were combined for each conduit group, both ASV and SFA conduits had a higher rate of conduit failure when compared with the prosthetic conduits (p < 0.05, log-rank test). Limb loss resulting from cross-femoral conduit failure occurred in six (17.6%) patients in the ASV group, four (28.6%) patients in the SFA group, and one patient each in the iliac and prosthetic groups. These differences were not significant.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of increased shear stress on the aggregability of platelets as they traverse a long, small-caliber (6 mm) Dacron graft in the dog and on the surface thrombosis and endothelialization of such a graft.\nEach of nine dogs received bilateral carotid-femoral artery grafts, approximately 75 cm long, for 3 months; one graft of each pair had a distal femoral arteriovenous fistula to produce a higher shear rate than the contralateral graft. Platelet aggregation scores were determined on blood withdrawn from the external jugular vein and from the proximal and distal ends of the grafts in each animal. Graft flow rates, which were used in the computation of shear stress, and luminal pressure gradients through grafts were measured during surgery and specimen retrieval. Specimens were studied with light microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin and immunocytochemical staining and by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate the nature, composition, and thickness of the flow surface lining, as well as the transmural healing.\nTwo high-shear stress and two low-shear stress grafts occluded unilaterally; five dogs had bilaterally patent grafts, allowing comparative analyses. All subjects had low platelet aggregability with aspirin. Platelet aggregation scores taken from proximal and distal ends of the grafts were not significantly different. The high-shear stress grafts had significantly more endothelial-like cell coverage (p < 0.0371) than the low-shear stress grafts, less flow-surface thrombus (p < 0.0056), and a thinner surface lining (p < 0.0029), on both the neointima and pseudointima.\nIn subjects with low platelet aggregation scores, long Dacron grafts do not elevate platelet aggregability of blood flowing through them. High-shear stress grafts have less flow surface thrombus, more endothelialization, and a thinner surface lining than do low-shear stress grafts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a bifurcated endoluminal prosthesis for transfemoral placement in the aortoiliac position with a large-animal model that would simulate human implantation.\nFifteen calves (160 to 200 kg) underwent bilateral femoral artery exposure and transfemoral placement in the aortoiliac position of a bifurcated Dacron prosthesis, inserted through a 26F sheath with an over-the-bifurcation guide wire to retrieve the contralateral limb and secured proximally and distally with self-expanding attachment systems. The preferred location was determined before implantation and compared with final implant location by caliper measurements and angiography. Events during implantation, maneuvers used to accomplish accurate deployment, and final results, as judged by angiography and clinical evaluation, were recorded. Four animals survived and were used for chronic evaluation and healing by gross and microscopic studies.\nAll grafts (n = 15) were patent at the end of the procedure. All (n = 7) noncrimped grafts had minor kinks in areas of curvature, whereas eight of eight crimped grafts (device modification) had none. Torque control of the body and individual limbs was necessary to correct twists before deployment in 10 of 15 grafts, with two greater than 30-degree twists remaining, which did not appear to affect flow. One implant was entirely deployed in the aorta because of parallax error, subsequently avoided by use of a marker board placed dorsally. Three premature deployments occurred, corrected by attachment system lock modification. The mean final implant position was within 2.9 +/- 1.4 mm (aortic), 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm, and 1.5 +/- 0.8 mm (contralateral and ipsilateral iliac limbs, respectively) of the intended position. Three of four animals intended for long-term evaluation were killed prematurely because of clinically evident spinal cord ischemia. Histologic sections at 2 weeks showed early wall repair without inflammatory cells and pannus ingrowth across the anastomosis.\nWe conclude that implantation of a bifurcated endovascular prosthesis through the bilateral femoral approach is possible, provided the intended aortic implantation site (neck) is at least 12 mm in length (mean +/- 2 SD each direction). Torque control of each portion of the device will be needed in the majority of instances, with attention to parallax effect necessary for optimal placement. This animal model is not suitable for chronic graft evaluation because of its sensitivity for spinal cord ischemia. Healing data suggest graft incorporation similar to that of a surgically placed prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "The long-term clinical outcome of patients diagnosed with digital artery obstruction and symptomatic hand ischemia is largely unknown. Our long-term experience with the diagnosis of symptomatic digital artery obstruction and the long-term natural history of this condition forms the basis for this report.\nFrom 1971 to 1985, 44 patients with symptomatic hand ischemia and palmar or digital arterial obstruction underwent arteriography and digital photoplethysmography (PPG). Patients were grouped according to severity of hand ischemia symptoms, including ulceration and digital amputation and the presence of a connective tissue disease (CTD). Arteriography was compared with PPG by creating an objective severity scale (digital obstruction index [DOI]).\nAverage follow-up was 15.2 years (range 10 to 22 years). Initially 21 patients (48%) had moderate symptoms, and 23 patients (52%) had severe symptoms of hand ischemia. Follow-up symptoms in 28 patients improved (13 of 26 with CTD, 15 of 18 without CTD), in 15 patients (12 of 26 with CTD, 3 of 18 without CTD) remained unchanged, and in only 1 patient (1 of 26 with CTD) worsened. Seventeen (65%) patients with CTD (n = 26) had development of one or more ulcers, and six (24%) underwent one or more digital amputations. Four (22%) patients without CTD (n = 18) had finger ulceration (p < 0.012 compared with patients with CTD), and one patient (6%) underwent subsequent digital amputation (p = NS). The arteriography-DOI and PPG-DOI were equally accurate in determining severity of finger ischemia as manifested by severity of symptoms or ulcer development.\nThe favorable long-term prognosis of symptomatic finger artery occlusion described herein mandates the avoidance of premature finger amputation. Patients with CTD fare worse, but even in this group tissue loss is modest. Finger PPG is as accurate as arteriography for determining severity of hand ischemia.",

    "abstract": "We wanted to characterize the immediate effect of endarterectomy on flow of the arteries composing the extracranial carotid artery system.\nTransit time ultrasound probes were used to measure flow through the carotid bifurcation in 48 patients undergoing endarterectomy. Maximum single-diameter stenosis affecting the internal carotid artery (ICA) was determined by angiography. The significance of differences between means were determined by t tests and analysis of variance; linear and nonparametric correlation analyses were also applied to analyze the relation between stenosis and several flow-derived parameters.\nCommon carotid artery flow significantly increased (p = 0.0043) from a mean value of 264 +/- 99 ml/min to 314 +/- 98 ml/min, corresponding to an average percent increase of 34.3% +/- 71.3%. ICA flow increased from 128 +/- 69 ml/min to 173 +/- 66 ml/min (p < 0.0001), with an average percent increase of 74.9% +/- 114.9%. External carotid artery (ECA) flow decreased from 129 +/- 61 ml/min to 106 +/- 49 ml/min (p = 0.0098), representing an average percent decrease of -5.2% +/- 48.2%. The difference between ECA and ICA mean flow changes is highly significant (p < 0.001). The percent change in ECA flow did not correlate with preoperative stenosis. We noted, however, a positive correlation between stenosis and the ECA/ICA flow ratio before endarterectomy (Spearman r = 0.31, p = 0.032), indicating that more severe stenosis led to a greater distribution of blood into the ECA. The ECA/ICA flow ratio fell from an initial value (ECFbef/ICFbef) of 1.52 +/- 1.74 before endarterectomy to 0.69 +/- 0.37 (ECFaft/ICFaft) after endarterectomy (p = 0.0006).\nThe data are consistent, with the ECA being an important collateral path for cerebral perfusion when ICA stenosis exists. When endarterectomy relieves bifurcation stenosis, common carotid artery blood flow is redistributed preferentially to the ICA at the expense of ECA flow, consistent with a change in the relative resistances of the two vessels resulting from operative reconstruction.",

Demographic data, severity of venous insufficiency, ulcer characteristics, and patient compliance were studied. Outcome variables were time to complete ulcer healing and time to first recurrence.\nNinety-one percent of the ulcers healed completely at a median 3.4 months. There were 52 (57%) recurrences at a median 10.4 months. Ulcers on limbs with a venous refill time of 10 seconds or less demonstrated a significantly longer time to complete healing (p < or = 0.03); however, no effect on time to recurrence was observed. Patients who were in strict compliance with the treatment regimen (n = 32) had significantly faster healing (p < or = 0.02) and fewer recurrences (p < or = 0.004) compared with patients who were less compliant (n = 67).\nMost venous ulcers can be expected to heal when patients are enrolled in a nurse-managed/physician-supervised ambulatory ulcer clinic. Photoplethysmography-derived venous refill time of 10 seconds or less predicted delayed healing. Strict compliance with the treatment protocol significantly decreased the time to healing and prolonged the time to recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Most epidemiologic studies on chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are cross-sectional surveys that suggest potential risk factors by describing their population. However, these relationships could be due to the CVI population's older age. We performed a dual case-control study with multivariate analysis to address this issue.\nNinety-three patients with venous ulcers, 129 patients with varicose veins (VV), and 113 general population control patients from two hospitals were interviewed by use of a standardized questionnaire covering medical history, patient demographics, medications, and lifestyle questions. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the groups.\nUnivariate analyses showed CVI to be characterized by several factors, many of which were found to be age related after multivariate analysis. Age-adjusted relationships for CVI include male sex and obesity. Histories of serious leg injury or phlebitis were important associations resulting in a 2.4-fold and 25.7-fold increase in risk for CVI, respectively. After adjusting for age, subjects with VV tend to be younger and female, to more frequently have a history of phlebitis, and to report a family history of VV more frequently than control subjects.\nMany of the previously suggested associations found with CVI are in reality due to this population's greater age. Patients with CVI are older, male, obese, have a history of phlebitis, and have a history of serious leg injury. These results suggest that a prior deep vein thrombosis, either clinical or subclinical, may be a predisposing factor for CVI.",

    "abstract": "A prospective, nonrandomized study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a nonoperative approach of anticoagulation therapy to manage saphenofemoral junction thrombophlebitis (SFJT).\nOver a 2-year period between January 1993 and January 1995, 20 consecutive patients with SFJT were entered into the study. They were hospitalized and given a full course of heparin. Duplex ultrasonography was performed before admission, both to establish the diagnosis and to evaluate the deep venous system. Two to 4 days after admission a follow-up scan was obtained to assess resolution of SFJT and to reexamine the deep venous system. Patients with SFJT alone and resolution of SFJT by duplex scanning were maintained on warfarin (Coumadin) for 6 weeks. Those with SFJT and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were maintained on Coumadin for 6 months. Incidence of concurrent DVT and its location were noted. The efficacy of anticoagulation therapy was evaluated by measuring SFJT resolution, recurrent episodes of SFJT, and occurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE).\nThere was a 40% incidence (eight of 20 patients) of concurrent DVT with SFJT. Of the eight patients, four had unilateral DVT, two had bilateral DVT, and two had development of DVT with anticoagulation. DVT was contiguous with SFJT in five patients and noncontiguous in three patients. Of 13 duplex scans obtained at 2 to 8 months follow-up, seven demonstrated partial resolution of SFJT, five had complete resolution, and one did not demonstrate resolution. There were no episodes of PE, no recurrences, and no complications of anticoagulation at maximum follow-up of 14 months.\nAnticoagulation therapy to manage SFJT was effective in achieving resolution, preventing recurrence and preventing PE within our follow-up period. There is a high incidence of DVT associated with SFJT that merits careful evaluation of the deep venous system during the course of management.",

The purpose of this study is to prospectively document the incidence of DVT complicating lower extremity amputation.\nDuring a recent 28-month period, 72 patients (71 men, 1 woman; mean age 68 years) undergoing major lower extremity amputation (31 above-knee and 41 below-knee) were prospectively evaluated with perioperative duplex scanning for DVT.\nDVT was documented in nine (12.5%) patients (one bilateral, four ipsilateral, and four contralateral to amputation). Patients with a history of venous disease were at significantly higher risk for development of DVT (p = 0.02). Thrombi were located at or proximal to the popliteal vein in eight patients and were isolated to the tibial veins in one patient. DVT was identified before operation in six patients and after operation in three. Patients with DVT were treated with heparin anticoagulation, with no patient experiencing clinical symptoms compatible with pulmonary embolism.\nIn our recent experience, lower extremity amputation is associated with DVT at or proximal to the popliteal vein in 11% of patients. Documentation of DVT prevalence is essential to assist surgeons in planning a management strategy for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of DVT associated with lower extremity amputation.",

The underlying disease was pulmonary embolism in 15 (47%) and DVT in 17 (53%) patients. Of patients with pulmonary embolism, 11 had a documented DVT, and four were not evaluated for DVT. There were 14 men and 18 women, with a mean age of 63.5 years (range 24 to 93 years). Indications for vena caval interruption were recurrent pulmonary embolism with therapeutic anticoagulation (n = 2 [6%]), prophylactic insertion with documented pulmonary embolism and therapeutic anticoagulation (n = 8 [25%]), documented pulmonary embolism and absolute contraindication to anticoagulation (n = 5 [16%]), documented DVT and absolute contraindication to anticoagulation (n = 2 [6%]), prophylactic insertion with documented DVT and therapeutic anticoagulation (n = 5 [16%]), and documented DVT with relative contraindication to anticoagulation (n = 10 [31%]). Of the 32 patients with inferior vena cava filters, 17 were not given anticoagulants (7 absolute contraindications, 10 relative contraindications), and 15 were given anticoagulants. Insertion of a percutaneous inferior vena cava filter in patients who were not given anticoagulants was followed by the development of phlegmasia cerulea dolens in four patients (24%), which was bilateral in two patients; one patient eventually died. No patients treated with inferior vena cava filter and anticoagulation had development of phlegmasia.\nPercutaneous inferior vena caval interruption effectively prevents pulmonary embolism in patients with DVT but does not impact the underlying thrombotic process and in fact may contribute to progressive thrombosis in patients who are not given anticoagulants. Anticoagulation with intravenous heparin in safe and effective therapy for DVT in most patients. We believe that percutaneous insertion of vena cava filters should not replace anticoagulation in routine proximal DVT, and those patients who require an inferior vena cava filter for failure of anticoagulation should continue to receive heparin to treat the primary thrombotic process. We caution that relative contraindications to anticoagulation should be carefully scrutinized before recommending vena cava interruption as a primary therapy for DVT.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to measure the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression of the plantar venous plexus on popliteal vein (PV) and common femoral vein (CFV) velocities measured by duplex ultrasound scanning.\nThirty lower limbs in 15 healthy volunteers had venous duplex scanning measurement of PV and CFV velocities before and during foot pumping with an arteriovenous impulse foot pump system. Venous velocities were measured at two pump pressure settings (100 mm Hg, 200 mm Hg) and during two pump impulse durations (short = 1 second, normal = 3 seconds). All limbs were examined with the subjects in the supine position, and then measurements were repeated with subjects in the 15-degree reverse Trendelenburg position. The mean maximum venous velocity (MVV) produced by foot pumping was compared with resting venous velocity at each anatomic location and for each technologic variable.\nImpulse foot pumping produced a statistically significant increase in MVV in both the PV and the CFV compared with resting velocities. This significant increase was observed for both pressure settings and both impulse durations, and no differences produced by these two individual variables could be detected. The increase in MVV produced by foot pumping was similar for limbs in the supine position and those examined in the reverse Trendelenburg position. The percentage increase in MVV produced by foot pumping was significantly higher in the PV than in the CFV.\nIntermittent pneumatic compression of the plantar venous plexus produces measurable increases in venous outflow from the lower limbs of normal subjects. This study seems to justify further evaluation of the effectiveness of this technique for mechanical deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in selected high-risk patient groups.",

    "abstract": "Presumed differences in the thrombolytic activity and fibrinolytic specificity of the three commonly used thrombolytic agents, streptokinase, urokinase, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), are based on clinical study results, where variability renders meaningful comparisons difficult. An in vitro model of catheter-directed venous thrombolysis was used to compare the three agents.\nRetracted iodine 125-radiolabeled clots that simulate those observed in the venous system were infused with thrombolytic agents at doses analogous to those used clinically. Perfusion with heparinized, whole human blood was undertaken for 60 minutes, measuring the efficacy of thrombolysis through serial quantification of radio tracer released into the circuit. Fibrinolytic specificity was determined by following decrements in perfusate fibrinogen concentration.\nStreptokinase was the agent associated with the slowest rate of clot lysis (p = 0.01 vs urokinase and rt-PA). Urokinase was associated with an intermediate rate of lysis but appeared to be the agent with the greatest degree of fibrinolytic specificity (p = 0.02 vs streptokinase, p = 0.05 vs rt-PA). Although rt-PA was associated with improved efficacy early in the perfusions, the differences between rt-PA and urokinase dissipated after 30 minutes.\nThese laboratory observations suggest that urokinase may be the most appropriate agent for catheter-directed venous thrombolysis, offering an advantageous compromise between fibrinolytic specificity and thrombolytic speed.",

    "abstract": "With clinical progression of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), dermal infiltration of mononuclear cells increases. Because these cells regulate chronic inflammatory responses and modulate wound healing, cellular dysfunction could explain alterations in wound healing with CVI. The purpose of this study was to determine whether monocytes in patients with CVI are dysfunctional.\nMononuclear cell function was measured as the degree of proliferation in response to a mitogenic challenge. Fifty patients were separated into four groups: group 1, 14 patients with normal limbs; group 2, 10 patients with class 2 CVI; group 3, 15 patients with active venous ulcers; group 4, 11 patients with healed venous ulcers and current evidence of lipodermatosclerosis. Duplex scanning and air plethysmography correlated with the clinical classification of CVI. Systemically circulating monocytes and lymphocytes were obtained by antecubital venipuncture from groups 1 to 4. Cells were cultured in the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C1, D, and E (mitogens) at 1, 8, 31, and 125 micrograms/well on the basis of previous dose-response experiments. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), 5 micrograms/well, served as a control mitogen. The dose-response curves indicated that 8 micrograms/well elicited the greatest degree of cell proliferation. Proliferative responses at 8 micrograms/well were analyzed for statistical significance among groups 1 to 4. Comparisons among groups were performed by use of the nonparametric Mann Whitney U post tests and a one-tailed unpaired t test. Results were considered significant at p < or = 0.05.\nProliferative responses to PHA indicate that lymphocytes and monocytes from patients with CVI are not globally depressed. However, patients in group 2 did not exhibit the same degree of proliferation to PHA as did groups 1, 3 and 4. Proliferative responses between groups 2 and 1 (44.38 +/- 43.9 vs 118.87 +/- 27.1, p < or = 0.05) and groups 2 and 3 (44.38 +/- 43.9 vs 105.95 +/- 60.99, p < or = 0.05) were significant. Challenges with staphylococcal enterotoxin A and B reveal significant diminution of proliferative responses in groups 2 (42.73 +/- 11.55, p < or = 0.05) and 3 (45.57 +/- 9.1, p < or = 0.05) and groups 3 (36.81 +/- 6.9, p < or = 0.05) and 4 (35.04 +/- 7.5, p < or = 0.05), compared with staphylococcal enterotoxin A controls (68.68 +/- 9.9) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B controls (66.25 +/- 13.56), respectively. A trend of diminished mononuclear cell function with progression of CVI was observed with staphylococcal enterotoxins B, C1, D, and E, strongly suggesting biologic significance. Furthermore, patients with lipodermatosclerosis uniformly exhibited the poorest proliferative responses.\nDeterioration of mononuclear cell function is associated with CVI. A trend of diminishing proliferative responses with clinical disease progression is observed and suggests biologic significance. The decreased capacity for mononuclear cell proliferation in response to various challenges may manifest itself clinically as poor and prolonged wound healing.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to measure the distribution of endogenous plasminogen activators during thrombolysis with an endothelial-conserving model of laminated thrombosis.\nThrombi were raised in the inferior vena cava of rats with thrombin and flow reduction. The thrombi, adjacent vein wall, and distant veins (the superior vena cava) were removed at intervals from 1 hour to 21 days from formation and then cryohomogenized and assayed with specific bioimmunoassays for tissue-type (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (u-PA).\nThe measured t-PA activity of the vein wall around the thrombus was reduced compared with the control inferior vena cava at 4 days. Both the u-PA and t-PA content of the thrombus increased progressively during thrombolysis. The t-PA activity increased significantly in the distant vein walls in the animals with thrombi. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization localized the t-PA to a mononuclear cell infiltrate and showed up-regulation of mRNA for rat t-PA in these monocytes.\nThe local plasminogen activator response was predominantly within the thrombus itself. Increased t-PA activity was additionally found in distant veins but was reduced in the vessel wall adjacent to the thrombus. This is the first report to show that u-PA activity is increased within organizing thrombus in vivo and that most of the t-PA activity is localized to a monocyte infiltrate.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the passive 45-degree reverse Trendelenburg position and graduated compression stockings (GCS) on plasma tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and endothelin-1 levels in a group of volunteers.\nTen healthy subjects lay on an examining table for 30 minutes while baseline measurements were made. The table was then tilted to a 45-degree upright position for 60 minutes, and measurements were repeated. On a different day, subjects were tilted again, but on this occasion they wore thigh-length GCS. Blood was drawn before and 60 minutes after tilting during both sessions, and plasma TFPI and endothelin-1 were obtained. Cross-sectional areas of the calf medial gastrocnemius vein, before and after tilting, were measured by a duplex scanner.\nUpright tilting induced a significant dilation of the medial gastrocnemius veins that was partially corrected by the use of elastic stockings. Similarly, endothelin-1 levels significantly increased after tilting. The use of GCS did not modify these differences. On the other hand, although TFPI levels were not affected by tilting without stockings, they were significantly elevated after tilting when GCS were used.\nUpright passive tilting induces significant dilation of the deep calf veins and is associated with a significant increase in plasma levels of endothelin-1, whereas TFPI levels remain unchanged. The use of elastic stockings reduces the degree of calf distention but does not prevent an increase in endothelin-1. TFPI levels are significantly increased after tilting when GCS are used. This might represent a previously unknown mechanism of action of elastic stockings with interesting potential for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. More studies are warranted in a larger series to confirm these results.",

The development of reflux was significantly more common among all initially uninvolved segments to which thrombus extended and among mid and distal superficial femoral and popliteal artery segments with rethrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a limited B-mode compression technique (BMCT) with a complete color-flow duplex venous examination (CDVE) for the detection of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nWe prospectively studied 72 patients (20 men and 52 women) for DVT. Two technologists blinded to each other performed either BMCT or CDVE independently. The BMCT is an abbreviated technique compressing two sites per limb. One site was the saphenofemoral junction including the superficial femoral and deep femoral vein confluence; the other was the saphenopopliteal junction including tibial vein confluence. Total limbs studied were 144. CDVE was considered the gold standard for purposes of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.\nThe technical failure rate of BMCT was three of 144. In all technically satisfactory examinations, the BMCT result was positive in 15 of 14 limbs, and the CDVE result was positive in 13. Sensitivity of BMCT was 100%, specificity was 98%, and overall accuracy was 99%. There were two false-positive results with BMCT; both were cases of popliteal veins deep to the artery leading to difficulty in compression. The BMCT was able to detect chronic thrombus, floating thrombus, and small thrombus behind femoral vein valve cusps.\nThese data suggest that BMCT is a rapid, acceptable, alternative technique for detecting proximal DVT. In cases of equivocal or positive findings, the spectral and color-flow Doppler examination should be used to confirm the results.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral lower extremity venous duplex scanning for acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been advocated because of the high incidence of occult contralateral leg involvement. We investigated the clinical necessity of such a policy.\nThe results from 2996 venous duplex studies performed during the past 2 years were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 1694 of these scans were performed on patients with symptoms, of whom 248 (15%) were found to have an acute DVT. Symptoms were limited to one side in 198 patients, whereas bilateral complaints were noted in 50 patients.\nAmong the patients with symptoms of acute DVT, 72 (29%) had bilateral involvement. Bilaterality was more likely in patients with bilateral symptoms than in those with only unilateral symptoms (56% vs 22%; p < 0.005). Of the patients with unilateral symptoms and bilateral DVT, all of them had either acute (80%) or acute and chronic (20%) thrombosis in the symptomatic leg. The contralateral asymptomatic limb had fewer acute and more chronic DVT (41% and 55%, respectively). No patient from the entire group admitted with symptoms had an acute DVT in the asymptomatic limb without a concomitant acute DVT in the symptomatic leg. Unilateral scanning would decrease the examination time by 21% and potentially increase total reimbursement for symptomatic venous scans by 9% compared with routine bilateral duplex scanning.\nAlthough bilateral involvement is frequent in patients with symptoms of acute DVT, treatment in these patients is not altered by this finding. We conclude that contralateral venous scanning in patients with unilateral symptoms is not clinically indicated and that unilateral scanning would result in improved cost-efficiency for vascular laboratories.",

    "abstract": "We observed that ultrasound examinations for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were more frequently requested for women than for men in our vascular laboratory serving a general outpatient population and referral 774-bed hospital. Because existing literature presents conflicting information about sex differences in occurrence of DVT, we investigated correlation in our population with positive ultrasound study results and risk factors for DVT.\nIn 13 months, 2055 ultrasound examinations for DVT were requested. Of these, 300 patients (15%) were categorized in four subgroups: 75 ultrasonography-negative men, 75 ultrasonography-negative women, 75 ultrasonography (DVT)-positive men, and 75 ultrasonography (DVT)-positive women for risk factor analysis.\nWomen comprised 64% (1311 of 2055) and men 36% (744 of 2055) of ultrasound examinations requested, but men had significantly higher incidence of DVT-positive ultrasonography results (101 of 744 [14%]) compared with women (118 of 1311 [9%]) (p = 0.002 by chi-square testing). There were no significant sex differences in conventional DVT risk factors and no difference in aggregate number of risk factors. The anatomic distribution of DVT was the same in men as in women. Among those having negative ultrasonography results, significantly more outpatient examinations were performed in women (p = 0.018 by t testing).\nGender bias exists in use of ultrasonography for diagnosis of DVT. The greater incidence of women undergoing venous ultrasonography is not explained by higher prevalence of DVT risk factors or of higher occurrence of positive ultrasound examination results. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences indicate underuse of ultrasonography in men or overuse in women.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and predictive value of the VFI as a predictor of phlebographically demonstrated \"critical\" venous reflux.\nThirty-one limbs with suspected venous insufficiency underwent both descending phlebography and air plethysmography. Nine limbs had deep venous reflux ending above the knee on descending phlebography (group 1), and 22 limbs had \"critical\" deep reflux to the below-knee level (group 2). The VFI, ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction were calculated, and a tourniquet was used to distinguish superficial from deep venous reflux.\nThree of six group 2 limbs with a VFI less than 7 had obliteration of their iliac veins. Tourniquet application improved the VFI in 13 limbs, all of which showed either phlebographic or venous duplex evidence of greater saphenous incompetence.\nA VFI greater than 7 showed a 73% sensitivity and 100% positive predictive value of identifying \"critical venous reflux.\" The VFI may underestimate the degree of reflux in patients with proximal venous obstruction. Improvement of venous hemodynamics with tourniquet application suggests that venous reflux might be improved in some patients by correcting superficial venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Calf muscle pump dysfunction is a recognized factor in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). We investigated the hypothesis that limbs with CVI have a reduced ankle range of motion (ROM) that may be responsible for the poor calf pump function associated with venous ulceration.\nAnkle ROM and calf pump function were assessed in 32 limbs of 26 adult men. Limbs were selected on the basis of clinical presentation: normal (n = 6 limbs), class 1 or 2 CVI with no history of ulceration (n = 9 limbs), class 3 CVI with healed ulceration (n = 9 limbs), and class 3 CVI with active ulceration (n = 8 limbs). ROM was determined by goniometry during maximal plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle. Calf pump function was determined by air plethysmographic measurement of ejection fraction (EF) and residual volume fraction (RVF).\nAnkle ROM was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in each CVI group compared with age-matched control subjects, because of decreases in both plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. Calf pump function was significantly impaired (decreased EF and increased RVF) in ulcerated limbs. ROM was significantly correlated to EF and RVF. Impairment of ROM and calf pump function was associated with deterioration in the clinical classification of venous disease.\nLimbs with CVI have a limited ankle ROM that decreases with increasing severity of clinical symptoms. This decreased ROM is associated with, and may contribute to, poor calf pump function.",

    "abstract": "Congenital deficiency of antithrombin III (AT III) is the only inherited hypercoagulable disorder for which a concentrate of purified protein is available for replacement therapy during periods of increased thrombotic risk. This report describes how such concentrates have been used in a patient with congenital AT-III deficiency undergoing venous surgery. A 40-year-old woman with AT III deficiency was evaluated for bilateral grade 3 chronic venous insufficiency. Noninvasive venous assessment and ascending venography revealed incompetence of the lower leg perforators, a patent deep venous system, and competent greater and lesser saphenous veins. Staged subfascial ligations were performed. Pasteurized AT III was administered 1 hour before surgery and at 30 hours at a dose calculated to increase AT-III activity to at least 120%. Perioperative AT III activity levels were measured. Subcutaneous heparin and oral warfarin were initiated the evening of surgery. An infusion of AT III increased plasma AT III from the baseline activity of 51% to 180%; it was 87% 13 hours later. Two measurements of the initial half-life of AT III were 7 and 14 hours. No perioperative thrombotic complications occurred. The ulcers healed, and the patient remains symptom free. Pasteurized AT III concentrates are now commercially available, easily administered, and provide a useful adjunct to the anticoagulation regimen of patients with AT III deficiency undergoing vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Seeding prosthetic arterial grafts with genetically modified endothelial cells (ECs) has the potential to substantially improve graft function. However, preliminary applications suggest that grafts seeded with retrovirally transduced ECs yield a significantly lower percent surface coverage than those seeded with nontransduced ECs. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that canine ECs transduced with the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) gene would have a lower rate of adherence to pretreated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) both in vitro and in vivo and that they would proliferate at a slower rate on pretreated ePTFE in vitro.\nEarly passage ECs derived from canine external jugular vein were transduced with the retroviral MFG vector containing the gene for human tPA. ECs exposed to media alone served as controls. Iodine 125-labeled ECs were seeded in vitro onto ePTFE graft segments pretreated with canine whole blood, fibronectin (50 micrograms/ml), or media alone, and the percent of ECs adherent at 1 hour were determined (n = 3). Additional tPA-transduced and -nontransduced ECs were grown for 10 days on either fibronectin (50 micrograms/ml)-pretreated ePTFE wafers or tissue culture plastic pretreated with gelatin (1%) or fibronectin (50 micrograms/ml), and the EC proliferation rates were determined (n = 3). Furthermore, 125I-labeled ECs were seeded onto fibronectin (50 micrograms/ml)-pretreated ePTFE graft segments implanted as carotid and femoral artery interposition grafts (n = 3). The grafts were harvested after 1 hour, and the percent of ECs adherent was determined.\nHuman tPA was detected by immunohistochemical staining in 61% +/- 5% of the transduced ECs and was expressed at 35.4 +/- 12.9 ng/hr/10(6) cells. Fibronectin and whole blood pretreatment of the ePTFE grafts led to greater EC adherence in vitro than did media alone (90.9% +/- 5.3% vs 77.8% +/- 5.8% vs 4.7% +/- 1.1%, p < or = 0.05). No significant difference in the rates of adherence or proliferation was seen in vitro between the transduced and nontransduced ECs. No significant difference in proliferation was found for the transduced ECs on the three matrices tested in vitro. In contrast, adherence of the transduced ECs in vivo was significantly lower than that of nontransduced ECs (64.7% +/- 2.1% vs 73.7% +/- 4.1%, p < or = 0.05) 1 hour after implantation.\nLower rates of surface endothelialization by genetically modified ECs in vivo do not appear to be due to an impaired capacity to initially adhere or proliferate on the synthetic graft but may result from decreased adherence after exposure to in vivo hemodynamic forces.",

    "abstract": "The most quoted literature on arteriographic complications is based on self-reports collected during the mid 1970s. We sought to determine whether those results remain valid despite changes in arteriographic practice and whether patient subgroups at increased risk could be identified.\nFive hundred forty-nine consecutive patients were examined after arteriography and twice over 72 hours. Patients were telephoned at least 2 weeks later to identify delayed complications. The sample was divided into two groups to allow independent validation of suspected prognostic factors.\nThe rate of major complications was 2.9% (16/549), but varied from 0.7% to 9.1% among three strata of relative risk. Rates were highest in patients studied for suspected aortic dissection, mesenteric ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and lowest in patients with trauma or aneurysmal disease. Patients studied for claudication or limb-threatening ischemia had intermediate risk (2.0%). Within these strata, congestive heart failure and furosemide use were the only variables independently associated with a significantly increased complication rate.\nPrevious reports have overestimated the risk of arteriography for trauma or aneurysm but substantially underestimate the risk for patients with other common conditions. Such stratified complication rates are essential to understand relative costs and benefits of arteriography and other vascular imaging modalities in specific clinical situations.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine the influence of changes in intraoperative management on the outcome of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA).\nRetrospective review of our surgical experience of RAAA identified 61 patients and was separated into two periods: 1986 to 1988 (group 1 [n = 21 patients]) and 1989 to 1994 (group 2 [n = 40 patients]). Since 1989 operations have been conducted by two vascular surgeons without systemic administration of heparin and with control of suprarenal aorta if extensive hematoma is present, use of collagen-impregnated grafts, preferential repair with aortoaortic grafting, and routine use of intraoperative autotransfusion.\nFactors differing between the groups were use of intraoperative autotransfusion (4.76% in group 1 vs 80% in group 2, p < 0.00001), repair with tube grafting (42.8% in group 1 vs 80% in group 2, p = 0.003), number of packed homologous red blood cells (7.5 +/- 5.2 units in group 1 vs 3.1 +/- 3.6 units in group 2, p = 0.008), postoperative blood loss (365 +/- 705 ml in group 1 vs 133 +/- 351 ml in group 2, p = 0.01). The intraoperative mortality rate was significantly lower in group 2 (5% vs 28.6%, p = 0.016). The only predictive factor was the use of intraoperative autotransfusion with a lower mortality rate in patients undergoing autotransfusion (p = 0.029). The postoperative mortality rate was significantly lower in group 2 (20% vs 52.4%, p = 0.009). Predictive factors were use of intraoperative autotransfusion (p = 0.0009), age of the patients (p = 0.0039), and repair with tube graft (p = 0.039). The odds ratio of postoperative death was 25 times higher without intraoperative autotransfusion and seven times lower when a tube graft was used.\nContinuing efforts to achieve improvement in surgical technique and use of intraoperative autotransfusion were important determinants in lowering the postoperative mortality rate of RAAA to 20%.",

    "abstract": "A 47-year-old man was referred for evaluation and treatment of gastrointestinal variceal bleeding and possible transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunting. Intrahepatic manometry disclosed a normal portal pressure, but selective mesenteric arteriography revealed occlusion of the superior mesenteric, splenic, and inferior mesenteric veins. Duodenal and gastric varices were noted, but no esophageal varices were seen. The portal vein was clearly patent. At surgery, a 2 cm mass was found at the superior mesenteric vein-splenic vein juncture, and subsequent pathologic examination confirmed the presence of suture material within dense fibrous tissue as the probable cause for this rare condition. The surgical procedure performed was a superior mesenteric vein-to-portal vein bypass, employing ringed expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. Graft patency and function have been confirmed postoperatively by means of both venous-phase mesenteric arteriography and duplex imaging. The surgical procedure was novel, in that it was possible to decompress the hypertensive mesenteric circulation from the distal superior mesenteric vein directly into the portal vein with a prosthetic bypass. The physiologic benefit of this operation is clear: the avoidance of the encephalopathic syndrome and the facilitation of hepatopetal blood flow.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of iliofemoral endarterectomy performed through a single groin incision.\nThirty-two patients aged 34 to 75 years (mean age 63.4 years) with a male/female ratio of 20:12 underwent 36 lower extremity inflow reconstructions from July 1989 to September 1994. Surgical indications were for limb-threatening ischemia in 24 patients and for claudication in eight patients. The procedures were done for occlusive disease of the external iliac artery and common femoral artery with patients under either spinal (n = 24) or local (n = 12) anesthesia. Intraoperative balloon angioplasty with fluoroscopic guidance preceded open retrograde iliofemoral endarterectomy. Adjunctive procedures included 18 profundaplasties, eight femorofemoral, nine femoropopliteal, and one femorotibial bypasses.\nThirty-three of the 36 cases were initially successful. The three failures were in patients with extensive calcification. The mean follow-up has been 36.4 months, and the patency rate was 80.5% at 3 and 4 years. The four failures noted on follow-up were caused by three common iliac artery stenoses and one iliac system occlusion. The former group was successfully treated with balloon angioplasty/stent, and the latter patient required an aortofemoral bypass. No operative deaths or limb loss occurred in this series.\nRetrograde iliofemoral endarterectomy facilitated by balloon angioplasty is a safe, easy-to-perform, and viable option for patients with combined external iliac artery and common femoral artery occlusive disease. Midterm results (36.4 months) are favorable, and most hemodynamic failures are easy to correct with standard endovascular techniques.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid mediator of the microvascular dysfunction associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury. Because changes in cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration are essential in PAF cellular signaling, we formulated the hypothesis that blockade of Ca2+ entry may inhibit the PAF-induced microvascular dysfunction.\nTo investigate this hypothesis two L-type calcium channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine, were applied to the hamster cheek pouch before the topical PAF challenge was undertaken. Permeability was assessed by measurement of the plasma clearance of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran, 150,000 mol wt. The arteriolar diameter was measured simultaneously to evaluate the effects of L-type calcium channel blockers on PAF-induced vasoconstriction.\nBaseline clearance was 498.7 +/- 225.0 nl/60 min/gm (mean +/- SE). PAF at 10(-8) mol/L (n = 5) increased clearance to 3753.8 +/- 572.8 nl/60 min/gm (p < 0.01). Pretreatment with verapamil (2 mg/kg; n = 5) significantly reduced the increase in permeability caused by 10(-8) mol/L PAF (1909.1 +/- 620.2 nl/60 min/gm; p < 0.05). Nifedipine (5-10(-6) mol/L; n = 5) also significantly attenuated the impact of 10(-8) mol/L PAF (2037.2 +/- 427.5 nl/60 min/gm; p < 0.05). Neither verapamil nor nifedipine affected PAF-induced vasoconstriction.\nThe significant inhibition of the increase in permeability by the L-type calcium channel blockers suggests that these compounds may be useful in the management of PAF-induced hyperpermeability.",

The criterion for surgery was stenosis of 80% or greater. Follow-up by use of noninvasive methods was done by 6 months after operation the first year and annually thereafter. Recurrent stenosis was confirmed with angiography. Life-table analysis was used to estimate the risk of restenosis.\nEarly morbidity and mortality included six deaths (0.6%), seven nonfatal strokes (0.9%), and 19 hemorrhages. Two postoperative infections occurred. There were no important aneurysmal dilations and no late hemorrhages. With a mean follow-up of 41.4 months (range 0 to 197), recurrent stenosis necessitating reoperation developed in 28 patients (3.7%). There were two late strokes. Life-table analysis indicated a 89% probability of freedom from stenosis at 120 months.\nIn cases in which the decision to perform patch angioplasty is made at surgery, an ePTFE patch is an excellent alternative to autogenous saphenous vein, with a low rate of recurrences requiring operation and acceptable rates of perioperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality.",

The review focused on the indication for the operation, the surgical technique used, and the development of immediate and late postoperative complications. Long-term bypass graft patency and clinical success were determined on the basis of information gleaned from the office records of all patients. Only three patients were lost to follow-up at 12, 36, and 38 months.\nThere were no operative deaths. Two patients had small cervical wound hematomas, and two others experienced transient symptoms of brachial plexus irritation, which subsided spontaneously. Permanent nerve or lymphatic complications did not occur. In a mean follow-up of 47 months, carotid-axillary bypass graft patency was 96%, and 88% of the patients enjoyed symptom-free sustained clinical success.\nThis retrospective review demonstrates that a carotid-axillary bypass constructed with ringed synthetic graft material tunneled under the clavicle performs well and can be considered a reasonable alternative to the more standard carotid-subclavian bypass for the same indications.",

    "abstract": "Findings from the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) indicate that carotid endarterectomy can be beneficial in symptom-free patients with 60% to 99% carotid artery stenosis. However, patients in ACAS who underwent contrast angiography (CA) before carotid endarterectomy were exposed to an additional 1.2% risk of stroke.\nWe used the methods of decision analysis to assess whether the overall 5-year stroke risk in symptom-free patients with suspected carotid artery disease can be reduced by preoperative imaging with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or duplex ultrasonography (DU). We compared four strategies for the preoperative evaluation of carotid artery stenosis in symptom-free patients: 1) CA alone, 2) MRA alone, 3) DU alone, and 4) MRA and DU with CA when the results of these tests disagree. Accuracies of MRA and DU were estimated from 81 patients exposed to all three procedures; stroke risks for patients with 60% to 99% carotid artery stenosis were obtained from ACAS.\nFor predicting 60% to 99% carotid stenoses, sensitivity and specificity for noninvasive tests, optimized to reduce morbidity, were as follows: DU (0.96, 0.66), MRA (1.00, 0.76), DU/MRA (1.00, 0.86; 26% would require CA). The 5-year stroke risk of these four strategies in order of decreasing benefit was MRA, 6.17%; MRA/DU, 6.34%; DU, 6.35%; and CA, 7.12%. In sensitivity analyses, noninvasive tests were advantageous even if the stroke rate with CA diminished to 0.4%, or if the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive tests fell to 70%.\nThe preoperative use of noninvasive tests resulted in a lower 5-year stroke risk compared with CA in symptom-free patients with suspected carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study, demonstrating the benefit of carotid endarterectomy for symptom-free patients with 60% or greater carotid artery stenosis, has given rise to the need for development of screening parameters for detection of these lesions. Traditional duplex categories (50% to 79%, 80% to 99%) are not applicable. We sought to develop duplex criteria for determination of 60% or greater carotid artery stenosis by comparison with arteriography.\nThe duplex scans and arteriograms of 110 patients (210 carotid arteries), obtained within 1 month of each other, were reviewed by blinded readers. Arteriographic stenosis was determined by the method of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study. Duplex measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were recorded, and ratios of velocities in the internal and common carotid arteries (ICA, CCA) were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), and accuracy were determined, and receiver-operator characteristic curves were generated.\nInterobserver agreement for measurement of arteriographic stenosis was \"almost perfect\" (kappa = 0.86). The criteria determined for detection of 60% or greater stenosis were as follows: PSVICA > 170 cm/sec (sensitivity 98%, specificity 87%, PPV 88%, NPV 98%, accuracy 92%), EDVICA > 40 cm/sec (sensitivity 97%, specificity 52%, PPV 86%, NPV 86%, accuracy 86%), PSVICA/PSVCCA > 2.0 (sensitivity 97%, specificity 73%, PPV 78%, NPV 96%, accuracy 76%), EDVICA/EDVCCA > 2.4 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 80%, PPV 88%, NPV 100%, accuracy 88%). If all of the above criteria were met, 100% accuracy was achieved.\nIt is concluded that 60% or greater carotid artery stenosis can be reliably determined by duplex criteria. The use of receiver-operator characteristic curves allows the individualization of duplex criteria appropriate to specific clinical situations of patient screening for lesions (high sensitivity and NPV) or use as a sole preoperative imaging modality (high PPV). Individual vascular laboratories must validate their own results.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to define the clinical features of aortic aneurysms occurring in heart transplant recipients.\nAmong the 734 patients who have undergone heart transplantation at our institution over the last 14 years, we have identified 12 patients (1.6% incidence) with aortic aneurysms (9 infrarenal, 3 thoracoabdominal), making this the largest reported series of aortic aneurysms (AA) in heart transplant recipients.\nFor nine of the 12 patients with AA (75%), the indication for transplantation was ischemic cardiomyopathy. This indication accounted for only 42% of the overall transplantation group; our data therefore show that the risk of infrarenal AA disease was higher for patients who underwent transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy than for other indications (p = 0.02). In two of the patients with thoracoabdominal AA, chronic dissection was identified as the specific AA cause, whereas all of the other patients in the study had nonspecific \"atherosclerotic\" AAs. All 12 patients were symptom free at the time of initial discovery of the AAs. Two of the patients with infrarenal AA were diagnosed with AAs before transplantation; for the seven remaining patients with infrarenal AAs, the mean time between transplantation and AA discovery was 5.0 years (range 1.2 to 11.8 years). Serial radiologic studies allowed us to determine the AA expansion rate in seven of the 12 patients. This rate varied from 0 to 2.53 cm/yr (mean 1.20 cm/yr; 1.0 cm/yr for infrarenal AA alone). Five patients with infrarenal AA underwent AA repair as the initial treatment. Three others underwent repair after their AAs significantly expanded under observation. Mean AA diameter at the time of repair was 6.9 cm. All three patients with thoracoabdominal AAs died of acute AA rupture before resection could be done, despite their initial asymptomatic state. AA diameters at time of rupture were 3.5, 6.0, and 11 cm. All of the eight patients with AA treated with surgery are alive and well (median follow-up 18 months). The only complication was acute heart transplant rejection, which occurred 11 days after AA repair in one patient.\nOur data suggest that AA occurrence is more likely in patients who undergo heart transplantation for ischemic heart disease than for other indications. Careful serial radiologic surveillance is warranted in any heart transplant patient with an AA, because of the apparent potential for more rapid AA expansion in this patient population than in patients who do not undergo transplantation. We conclude that early repair of infrarenal AA is indicated because excellent operative results and low morbidity rates can be achieved. An aggressive approach to thoracoabdominal AAs in this group may also be appropriate because of the apparent propensity to lethal rupture, sometimes at relatively small AA size.",

    "abstract": "A variety of preoperative provocative tests have been used to define the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality after peripheral vascular procedures, including dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy and dobutamine stress echocardiography. Although highly sensitive, these tests are time-consuming and associated with significant expense. We investigated outpatient echocardiography as a less resource-intensive means of assessing cardiac risk with operation.\nOver a 2-year period 250 consecutive patients underwent outpatient transthoracic echocardiography before elective peripheral vascular operation was performed. The accuracy of the Goldman, Detsky, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status Classification clinical indexes of cardiac risk were assessed with regard to the development of cardiac complications such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, severe congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The accuracy of echocardiographically determined left ventricular ejection fraction was determined at threshold values between 20% and 60%.\nPerioperative cardiac events developed in 23 (9.2%) of the patients, and nine (3.6%) of the patients died as a result of these complications. Clinical indexes lacked sensitivity in the preoperative prediction of cardiac complications. Receiver operating curve analysis defined a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50% as an appropriate threshold for defining patients at high risk, with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 81% in the identification of patients who had cardiac morbidity. The positive predictive value was 27%, and the negative predictive value was 97%. The economic impact of outpatient echocardiography was well below that of dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy or dobutamine stress echocardiography.\nOutpatient echocardiography appears to offer a cost-efficient compromise between clinical criteria alone and provocative cardiac testing such as dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy and dobutamine stress echocardiography in the preoperative screening of patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "Changes in microvascular permeability play a critical role in the inflammatory sequence of tissue injury leading to leakage of proteins and subsequent edema. Primed responses induced by topical applications of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and histamine greatly increase microvascular permeability and mimic inflammation. We assessed the role of nitric oxide (NO) by use of 1-NG-monomethyl arginine (1-NMMA, a NO synthase inhibitor), on the primed microvascular permeability. We also explored the role of mast cells and a leukocyte adhesion complex by use of cromolyn sodium and 1B6 (a monoclonal antibody), respectively.\nForty anesthetized hamsters were separated into five groups: group 1 (n = 5) received no intervention; group 2 (n = 5) received topical 10(-9) mol/L PAF and 10(-6) mol/L histamine at a 5-minute interval; group 3 (n = 5 at each dose) received PAF/histamine and 1-NMMA (at 10(-5) mol/L or 10(-6) mol/L); group 4 (n = 5 at each dose) received cromolyn sodium plus PAF/histamine; group 5 (n = 5) received 1B6 plus PAF/histamine. We examined the cheek pouch with intravital videomicroscopy under fluorescent epiillumination. We quantified microvascular permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 150 with computer-assisted images analysis on the basis of integrated optical intensity (IOI) measurements.\nThe mean (+/- SEM) IOI of the control group was 8.7 +/- 5.2, whereas the group primed with PAF and histamine was 62.4 +/- 10.8. The 1-NMMA (10(-5) mol/L and 10(-6) mol/L) abolished the changes in microvascular permeability (p < 0.05) yielding IOI values of 8.0 +/- 1.6 and 10.9 +/- 2.8, respectively. Cromolyn sodium and 1B6 did not significantly attenuate the primed response to PAF and histamine.\nInhibition of NO synthase attenuates primed macromolecular extravasation in vivo. Our results indicate that NO is involved in the primed reaction of PAF and histamine, causing increases in microvascular permeability. Our study suggests a role for NO in the microcirculatory changes observed in ischemia-reperfusion injury and shock.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether major vascular surgery could be performed safely and with significant hospital cost savings by decreasing length of stay and implementation of vascular clinical pathways.\nMorbidity, mortality, readmission rates, same-day admissions, length of stay, and hospital costs were compared between patients who were electively admitted between September 1, 1992, and August 30, 1993 (group 1), and January 1 to December 31, 1994 (group 2), for extracranial, infrarenal abdominal aortic, and lower extremity arterial surgery. For group 2 patients, vascular critical pathways were instituted, a dedicated vascular ward was established, and outpatient preoperative arteriography and anesthesiology-cardiology evaluations were performed. Length-of-stay goals were 1 day for extracranial, 5 days for aortic, and 2 to 5 days for lower extremity surgery. Emergency admissions, inpatients referred for vascular surgery, patients transferred from other hospitals, and patients who required prolonged preoperative treatment were excluded.\nWith this strategy same-day admissions were significantly increased (80% [145/177] vs 6.2% [9/145]) (p < 0.0001), and average length of stay was significantly decreased (3.8 vs 8.8 days) (p < 0.0001) in group 2 versus group 1, respectively. There were no significant differences between group 1 and group 2 in terms of overall mortality rate (2.1% [3/145] vs 2.3% [4/177]), cardiac (3.4% [5/145] vs 4.0% [7/177]), pulmonary (4.1% [6/145] vs 1.7% [3/177]), or neurologic (1.4% [2/145] vs 0% [0/177]) complications, or readmission within 30 days (11.3% [16/142] vs 9.2% [16/173]) (p > 0.05). There were also no differences in morbidity or mortality rates when each type of surgery was compared. Annual hospital cost savings totalled $1,267,445.\nSame-day admission and early hospital discharge for patients undergoing elective major vascular surgery can result in significant hospital cost savings without apparent increase in morbidity or mortality rates.",
