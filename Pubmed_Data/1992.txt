    "abstract": "We explored the relationship between regression of diet-induced atherosclerosis and aneurysmal enlargement of the aorta in cynomolgus monkeys. Atherosclerotic plaques were induced in 17 monkeys by feeding them a diet containing 2% cholesterol and 25% peanut oil for 6 months (group I, n = 6; group III, n = 6) or 12 months (group II, n = 5). Regression was induced in group III by feeding a regression diet consisting of 0.25% cholesterol and 15% corn oil in a standard chow diet, for 6 months after the 6-month induction period. Serum cholesterol was 788 +/- 80 mg/dl after 6 months of induction, 508 +/- 53 mg/dl after the 12-month induction period, and 198 +/- 15 mg/dl in the regression group at 12 months. Aortas were fixed in situ under conditions of controlled pressure perfusion, and transverse sections of the unopened vessels were taken at standard levels in the midthoracic and abdominal aortic segments. The area encompassed by the internal elastic lamina was taken as a measure of artery size. Plaques were abundant in abdominal and thoracic sections after the 6- and 12-month induction periods, and no significant difference was observed in lumen area or artery size between the groups. The ratio of abdominal to thoracic aortic plaque area was markedly reduced in the regression group (0.3 +/- 0.2 for regression compared with 0.6 +/- 0.3 for 6-month induction and 1.3 +/- 0.2 for 12-month induction animals; p less than 0.05 for both). A twofold increase was observed in abdominal aortic lumen area in the regression group (10.0 +/- 1.5 mm2 for regression compared with 5.6 +/- 0.7 mm2 for the 6-month and 4.2 +/- 0.7 mm2 for the 12-month induction groups; p less than 0.05 for both) as well as a twofold increase in internal elastic lamina area (10.5 +/- 1.5 mm2 compared with 6.0 +/- 0.7 mm2 for the 6-month and 5.9 +/- 0.8 mm2 for the 12-month induction group; p less than 0.05 for both). Aortic enlargement in the regression group was accompanied by a reduction in media thickness in the abdominal aorta. No significant vessel enlargement or alteration in media thickness occurred in the thoracic aorta. One of six regression animals (17%) had a threefold enlargement of the abdominal aorta and was thought to have a manifest aneurysm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Recurrent pulmonary edema in patients with poorly controlled hypertension and renal insufficiency appears to be a marker of bilateral renal artery occlusive disease. The effectiveness of renal revascularization to prevent recurrent pulmonary edema in this distinct subgroup with renal artery occlusive disease was analyzed in 17 consecutive patients treated at the University of Michigan Hospital between 1984 and 1990. Their mean preoperative blood pressure was 207/110 mm Hg, and mean serum creatinine clearance was 3.8 mg/dl. Pulmonary edema occurred despite evidence of normal ventricular function in 65% of these patients. Bilateral renal artery occlusive disease affected 94% of the patients, and 54% had an occluded renal artery. Renal revascularization was accomplished by iliorenal bypass (41%), aortorenal bypass (29%), endarterectomy (24%), and transluminal angioplasty (6%). Contralateral nephrectomy (41%) and concomitant aortic reconstruction (24%) were also required frequently. No postoperative deaths occurred, and no patient had early postoperative pulmonary edema. Control of hypertension was improved in all patients, two of whom were discharged from the hospital on no antihypertensive medications. Two of the three patients requiring dialysis before operation were able to discontinue dialysis after operation. Late follow-up (mean, 2.4 years) revealed hypertension to be cured in one patient (6%), and improved in 16 patients (94%). Pulmonary edema occurred in one patient during late follow-up. Late follow-up showed renal function (mean creatinine, 1.7 mg/dl) to be improved in 77%, stable in 12%, and worse in two patients; one required dialysis. A single episode of pulmonary edema in a patient with poorly controlled hypertension and renal insufficiency should prompt consideration of this clinical syndrome and early diagnostic angiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We tested, in the dog, the hypothesis that selective deep hypothermia (19 degrees to 12 degrees C) of the spinal cord protects it from the ischemia that follows double aortic cross-clamping. The extracorporal perfusion system consisted of heat exchanger and a pump, infusing saline solution at 5 degrees C into the subarachnoid space (L-6) and draining it through the cisterna magna. After 30 minutes this system cools a normally perfused spinal cord to a stable temperature gradient of 13 degrees C (inflow) to 18 degrees C (outflow). Proximal and distal intrathecal, proximal and distal aortic, and central venous pressures were continuously recorded. Rectal temperature was maintained between 36.5 degrees C and 38.5 degrees C. Eight control dogs had cross-clamping of the aorta below the left subclavian artery and above the diaphragm without cord hypothermia. Nine experimental dogs had cord hypothermia initiated 50 minutes before systemic heparinization (100 U/kg) and double cross-clamping of the aorta. Cross-clamping was maintained for 45 minutes. The aorta was then unclamped, heparin was reversed, cord cooling was discontinued, and the dura was closed. Hindlimb function of animals was graded by use of Tarlov's scale at recovery and 24 hours later. The dogs were then killed, and the cords were removed and fixed for microscopy. All control animals were paraplegic and had histologic confirmation of spinal cord infarction. All experimental animals had intact hindlimb function and normal appearing cords on histologic examination. A two-tailed Fisher's exact test (chi square) shows this difference to be significant to p = 0.00004. In the dog selective deep hypothermia of the cord avoids the ischemic injury induced by aortic cross-clamping that results in paraplegia. The implications of these findings in thoracoabdominal aortic clamping in humans is discussed.",

    "abstract": "In a 1-year period all patients undergoing general vascular surgery (491 patients, 534 procedures) underwent monitoring by creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes and electrocardiograms (ECG) to detect perioperative myocardial infarction. Only those patients with severe symptomatic coronary artery disease (31 patients, 5.8%) characterized by unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled arrhythmia, or severe congestive heart failure had any testing for coronary artery disease beyond history, physical examination, and ECG. Only three patients (0.5%) had prophylactic coronary artery bypass performed before general vascular procedures. Twenty-one (3.9%) myocardial infarctions (five asymptomatic, detected by enzymes only, and 16 symptomatic, four of which were fatal) were associated with the 534 procedures (aorta 105, carotid 87, infrainguinal bypass 207, extraanatomic 51, other 84). Eight noncardiac perioperative deaths occurred. All operative deaths (12 of 534, 2.2%) including all four fatal myocardial infarctions occurred associated with surgery on an urgent or emergency basis (12 of 249 procedures, urgent/emergent operative mortality rate 4.8%). No operative deaths and no fatal myocardial infarctions associated with the 285 elective procedures occurred. Nine of the 17 nonfatal myocardial infarctions (53%) also occurred after urgent/emergent procedures. The rate of perioperative myocardial infarctions (eight of 285, 2.8%) after elective surgery in this patient series is no different from that reported by multiple recent authors advocating widespread screening for and prophylactic treatment of coronary artery disease before general vascular surgery. Our experience confirms the therapeutic approach that expensive and invasive coronary screening programs in patients to undergo vascular operations should be limited to carefully selected patients with severely symptomatic coronary disease.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative cardiac testing in patients undergoing vascular surgery remains controversial. We have advocated selective use of dipyridamole-thallium scans based on clinical markers of coronary artery disease before aortic surgery. The present study assessed both the efficacy of this policy and the role of surgical factors in the current morbidity of aortic reconstruction. Two hundred two elective aortic reconstructions (151 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 51 aortoiliac occlusive disease) performed in the period from January 1989 to June 1990 were reviewed. Preoperative dipyridamole-thallium scanning was performed in 29% of all patients, prompting coronary angiograms in 11% and coronary artery bypass grafting/percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 9% of patients before aortic reconstruction. The overall operative mortality rate was 2%, with one cardiac-related death. Major cardiac (nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina) and pulmonary complications occurred in an additional 4% and 6%, respectively, of patients. Coronary artery disease clinical markers and surgical factors were analyzed with stepwise logistic regression for the prediction of operative mortality rates and major cardiopulmonary complications. Variables retaining significance in predicting postoperative death or cardiopulmonary complications included prolonged (more than 5-hour) operative time (p less than 0.004), operation for aortoiliac occlusive disease (p less than 0.010), and a history of ventricular ectopy (p less than 0.002). Prolonged operative time (p less than 0.006) and the detection of intraoperative myocardial ischemia (p less than 0.030) were predictive of major cardiac complications after univariate analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Although cefazolin prophylaxis has proven efficacy in vascular surgery, Staphylococcus aureus wound infections are still an important postoperative complication. In cardiac surgery, cefazolin's susceptibility to hydrolysis by staphylococcal beta-lactamase has been proposed to account for some prophylaxis failures. To determine whether the incidence of vascular wound infections can be reduced by administering a more beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin, we undertook a prospective, randomized trial of cefuroxime versus cefazolin. Cefuroxime was administered as a 1.5 gm dose before operation and 750 mg every 3 hours during operation. Cefazolin was given as 1 gm before operation and 500 mg every 4 hours during operation. Both agents were continued every 6 hours after operation for 24 hours. Deep wound infections developed in seven of 272 (2.6%) cefuroxime and three of 287 (1.0%) cefazolin recipients (p = 0.2). Staphylococcus aureus wound infections occurred in five cefuroxime versus two cefazolin recipients. In vitro evaluation of six of the study isolates plus an additional eight S. aureus strains from vascular wound infections showed greater susceptibility of the strains to cefazolin than cefuroxime (median minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.5 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, p less than 0.05). Furthermore, despite its more frequent intraoperative redosing, cefuroxime exhibited lower trough serum concentrations than cefazolin. Among cefuroxime recipients, infection-associated procedures were significantly longer than infection-free procedures (p less than 0.05), suggesting that low tissue antibiotic concentrations may have contributed to the pathogenesis of these infections. In contrast, the length of the procedure was not a risk factor for infection among cefazolin recipients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Repeated complaints of postoperative wound pain prompted this review of 113 consecutive vascular operations involving a retroperitoneal approach to the aorta or iliac vessels or both. Flank muscle-splitting incisions (n = 53) had been used to approach the terminal aorta or iliac arteries. Two types of muscle-dividing incisions had also been used: incisions through the eleventh intercostal space (n = 41) to approach the infrarenal aorta; and incisions through the eighth, ninth, or tenth intercostal space with division of the diaphragm (n = 19) to approach the suprarenal aorta. Data on incisional pain, lumbosacral neuritic pain, incisional hernia, and deforming abdominal bulge were culled from the records of follow-up examinations conducted on all patients during periods ranging from 2 to 48 months. Both types of muscle-dividing incisions used to expose the aorta were associated with a 23% (14/60) incidence of abdominal bulge, a 7% (4/60) incidence of incisional hernia, and, more important, a 37% (22/60) incidence of prolonged disabling pain. Thus, although retroperitoneal exposure may be the preferred or the safest approach to certain aortic lesions, its routine use via muscle-dividing incisions is not recommended when the proposed operation can be carried out equally well by the conventional midline transperitoneal approach.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous arterial dissection may occur in a dramatic fashion and is often fatal if treatment is not instituted promptly. Diagnosis may be particularly difficult when cases of arterial dissection appear in unusual locations. We report a rare case of atraumatic dissection of the splenic artery that occurred in a 66-year-old male patient, who was admitted with acute severe epigastric and substernal pain, which worsened on inspiration. On admission, his physical examination was unremarkable, and he was hemodynamically stable. After excluding cardiopulmonary catastrophes and aortic dissection as a cause, a left retroperitoneal mass was found on arteriography to be a contained rupture of a splenic artery dissection. The patient underwent urgent resection of the splenic artery with preservation of the spleen. Splenic artery dissection is a rare condition. Only 11 cases have been previously published in the literature, and all of these cases were diagnosed after death. Successful management depends on consideration of the diagnosis, especially when other more common disease processes have been excluded.",

All patients referred with abdominal aortic aneurysms less than 5.0 cm maximum diameter were prospectively followed regardless of their fitness for operation. Two hundred sixty-eight patients had been entered into the study by December 31, 1988, and monitored until December 31, 1990, by at least two aneurysm sizings by ultrasonography, CT scanning, or both. The mean follow-up was 42 months. Operations were performed on 114 patients (if they were fit for operation) when the aneurysm reached 5.0 cm, expanded more than 0.5 cm in a 6-month period, or when the patient had significant occlusive disease requiring repair. In this group the mean annual increase in diameter was 0.9 cm. One hundred fifty-four patients were monitored without operation for a mean period of 42 months. One rupture occurred in this group. The average annual increase in diameter in the group not undergoing operation was 0.24 cm.

    "abstract": "This study examines the relative contributions of intraluminal pressure, blood flow, wall tension, and shear stress to the development of myointimal thickening in experimental vein grafts. To study these different hemodynamic parameters, several experimental models were created in 30 New Zealand White rabbits separated into six groups: common carotid interposition vein grafts harvested at 4 weeks (VG-4) or 12 weeks (VG-12), common carotid-linguofacial vein arteriovenous fistulas harvested at 4 weeks (AVF-4) or 12 weeks (AVF-12), AVFs with partial outflow obstruction harvested at 4 weeks (AVFobs), and combination VG-AVFs in series harvested at 4 weeks (VGAVF). Blood pressure and flow in the graft or vein were measured by use of a transducer-tipped pressure catheter and electromagnetic flow meter. At harvest, veins were perfusion-fixed and proximal, middle, and distal sections were subjected to computerized morphometric analysis. Vein grafts were characterized by a high mean pressure (VG-4, 51 +/- 4; VG-12, 62 +/- 3 mm Hg), low mean flow (VG-4, 17 +/- 1; VG-12, 16 +/- 4 ml/min), large luminal area (VG-4, 19.7 +/- 2.4; VG-12, 19.3 +/- 3.9 mm2), high wall tension (VG-4, 17.0 +/- 1.5; VG-12, 19.5 +/- 2.4 x 10(3) dyne/cm), low shear stress (VG-4, 0.75 +/- 0.13; VG-12, 0.96 +/- 0.38 dyne/cm2), and a high degree of myointimal thickening (VG-4, 5.89 +/- 0.90; VG-12, 4.72 +/- 0.83 mm2). Arteriovenous fistulas were characterized by a low mean pressure (AVF-4, 5 +/- 1, AVF-12, 6 +/- 2 mm Hg), elevated blood flow (AVF-4, 82 +/- 16; AVF-12, 82 +/- 17 ml/min), small luminal area (AVF-4, 2.43 +/- 0.58; AVF-12, 7.14 +/- 2.68), low wall tension (AVF-4, 0.62 +/- 0.19; AVF-12, 0.89 +/- 0.24 x 10(3) dyne/cm), elevated shear stress (AVF-4, 108 +/- 32; AVF-12, 71 +/- 50 dyne/cm2), and decreased myointimal area (AVF-4, 1.18 +/- 0.26; AVF-12, 1.90 +/- 0.55 mm2). The addition of outflow obstruction to AVFs (AVFobs) resulted in elevated pressure (48 +/- 2 mm Hg), decreased flow (17 +/- 4 ml/min), larger luminal area (8.71 +/- 2.31 mm2), elevated wall tension (10.3 +/- 1.7 x 10(3) dyne/cm), and a degree of myointimal thickening approaching that of vein grafts (3.79 +/- 0.66 mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "It is well established that primary arterial reconstruction, even to crural vessels, is cheaper than amputation. Reintervention increases expenditure and may produce mean costs exceeding those of primary amputation. Furthermore, secondary amputation may eventually become necessary. Femorocrural grafts have the highest average \"reconstruction policy\" cost (i.e., primary procedure and all further operations necessary during follow-up). We must therefore seek support for this potentially expensive form of treatment. In conjunction with health economists we have compared the average policy cost of 130 reconstructions with grafts exceeding 70 cm in length (89 vein grafts, 41 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts with a distal vein collar) with 67 vascular amputations, at mean follow-up of 3 years. One-month mortality rate after reconstruction was less than 1% but was 10% after amputation. At 3 years, however, 20% of both groups were dead. Overall 3-year patency is 65% (72% for vein grafts, 48% for polytetrafluoroethylene grafts). Ninety-seven percent of irreversible graft occlusions resulted in amputation in these patients. After autologous vein grafting reintervention, our follow-up showed increased mean costs from $6898 to $15,024 per patient. After prosthetic grafting, the higher reintervention rate increased from $6898 to $20,416. These mean costs remained less than amputation, reintervention, and additional mobility costs, which amounted to a mean of $21,726 per patient. Important differences in outcome were observed: 70% of patients undergoing amputation were confined to the home compared with only 9% of patients undergoing reconstruction; 30% of patients undergoing amputation were confined to bed or had to use a wheelchair compared with 1% of patients undergoing reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in 19 of 1078 patients treated between 1987 and 1991. All patients with antiphospholipid syndrome had either anticardiolipin antibody (16/19) or lupus anticoagulant (10/19); three patients had thrombocytopenia, eight patients had a prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and 10 patients had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The most common site of involvement was the cerebral circulation (nine patients), manifested by transient ischemic attacks or stroke. Eight patients had upper extremity disease, characterized by symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, with angiographic lesions involving the brachial, radial, ulnar, and/or digital arteries. Lower extremity disease occurred in seven patients, with clinical presentations similar to those of atherosclerosis and varying angiographic patterns. In comparison with the population having atherosclerosis, patients with arterial manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome were more likely to be women (13 of 19 versus 411 of 1078, p less than 0.02), were significantly younger (46.2 years versus 63.6 years, p less than 0.0001), did not smoke (1 of 19 patients versus 700 of 1078, p less than 0.0001), had a higher percentage of upper extremity involvement (8 of 18 versus 13 of 1078, p less than 0.0001), and had a higher incidence of early graft failure (9 of 12 grafts versus 13 of 371 grafts, p less than 0.0001). The syndrome is associated with the repetitive failure of vascular reconstructions and occlusion of native vessels. Antiphospholipid syndrome should therefore be suspected in young, female, nonsmokers with vascular disease, especially those with involvement of the upper extremity, cerebrovascular disease with normal findings on extracranial carotid angiography, and premature graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Use of the ipsilateral greater saphenous vein for arterial bypass procedures is frequently limited by previous stripping, bypass operations, or anatomic unsuitability. In such cases the contralateral greater saphenous vein or arm veins are often used. However, over the past 5 years we have used the lesser saphenous vein as a preferred alternative autogenous vein. Duplex scanning has been used in 311 cases for preoperative mapping and assessment with excellent correlation with actual anatomy found at operation. Harvest of the lesser saphenous vein has been facilitated by the use of a medial subfascial approach not requiring special positioning of the leg. A total of 91 lesser saphenous veins have been used for arterial bypass procedures; 66 of these were repeat cases. Vein use was 90.2%. In 40 of these cases the lesser saphenous vein was used as the entire conduit, including 10 in situ, 20 reversed vein (including 18 for coronary artery bypass), and 10 orthograde vein bypasses. In the remaining 33 cases the lesser saphenous vein was spliced to another vein to complete a bypass procedure. In the entire group, patency was 77% at 2 years. These data suggest that the lesser saphenous vein should be a principal alternative to ipsilateral greater saphenous vein for arterial bypass because of its ready availability, high use rate, ease of harvesting and preparation, and ideal handling characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The value of the popliteal-to-distal artery bypass in limb salvage is well documented. However, the influence of progression of disease in the superficial femoral artery or proximal popliteal artery, and the role of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of these vessels before bypass have not been adequately assessed. To evaluate these and other factors, we reviewed our experience with 153 nonsequential popliteal-to-distal artery bypasses performed over a 12-year period. Limb salvage was the indication for all procedures, and 87% of the patients were diabetic. The 5-year primary and secondary graft patency rates were 55% and 60%, respectively, and the limb salvage rate was 73%. Preoperative arteriograms were evaluated for stenosis in the superficial femoral artery or popliteal artery proximal to the graft. Fifty-six grafts with a proximal stenosis 20% or less were identified and had primary graft patency of 77% at 2 years, similar to the 70% patency for the 20 grafts placed distal to a 21% to 35% stenosis. The 18 grafts placed distal to a stenosis greater than 35% had 53% 2-year primary graft patency (p = 0.25). Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of a superficial femoral artery or popliteal artery stenosis (24% to 85% luminal narrowing) in 19 limbs resulted in 68% 2-year graft patency, not significantly lower than grafts with 35% or less proximal stenosis (75%, p = 0.25). Other factors associated with significant decreases in graft patency included a vein graft diameter less than 3.0 mm, a dorsalis pedis outflow site, and poor quality outflow. Thus the popliteal-to-distal bypass is a durable procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Angiography, angioscopy, and duplex scanning have each been advocated for intraoperative assessment of in situ saphenous vein grafts. We compared these three modalities during operation in a prospective, blinded study during the construction of 20 femoral-infragenicular in situ saphenous vein grafts. Each modality was used and interpreted by a surgeon blinded to the results of the other studies. Abnormalities requiring intervention were defined as (1) patent vein side branches, (2) residual valve cusps, and (3) anastomotic stenoses greater than 30%. Criteria, specific to the modality, corresponding to each category were prospectively defined. Fourteen residual valve cusps, 49 patent vein branches, and 6 anastomotic stenoses were suggested by at least one modality. Nine residual valve cusps, 32 patent vein branches, and no anastomotic stenoses were actually found (and corrected) by direct inspection. Sensitivity of detecting patent side branches for angiography, duplex scanning, and angioscopy was 44%, 12%, and 66%, respectively. Both angiography and angioscopy were significantly more sensitive than duplex scanning for detection of unligated side branches (p less than 0.01). Sensitivity of detecting residual valve cusps was 22% (angiography), 11% (duplex scanning), and 100% (angioscopy). Angioscopy was significantly more sensitive than either duplex scanning or angiography in detection of residual valve cusps (p less than 0.01). Since no anastomotic stenoses were confirmed, the false-positive rates for stenosis detection were 20% for angiography, 10% for duplex scanning, and 0% for angioscopy. Time requirement was 17 to 20 minutes and did not differ among the three modalities. No stenosis or arteriovenous fistula has been detected in any graft by postoperative duplex surveillance (mean, 10-month follow-up).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The diameter of aortic aneurysms were standardized to measures of patient size and normal aortic size in an effort to define indexes that might be more predictive of aneurysm rupture than raw aneurysm diameter alone. Normal aortic diameters were measured in 100 patients undergoing abdominal CT scans for other reasons, and an average infrarenal aortic diameter of 2.10 +/- 0.05 cm was observed. Normal aortic diameter was dependent on both age and sex, ranging from 1.71 +/- 0.06 cm in women below age 40 years to 2.85 +/- 0.04 cm in men above age 70 years. Overall, 11 (5.1%) of the ruptures occurred in aneurysms less than 5 cm in diameter, and four (1.9%) occurred in aneurysms less than 4.0 cm in diameter. When the CT scans of 100 patients undergoing elective aneurysm resection were compared with those of 36 patients with ruptured aneurysms, no threshold diameter value accurately discriminated between the two groups. However, standardization of the aneurysm diameter to the transverse diameter of the third lumbar vertebral body as an index of patient body size produced an accurate predictor of rupture when a threshold ratio of 1.0 was used. No aneurysm ruptured below this ratio, but 29% of elective aneurysms were smaller than the vertebral body diameter. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the superiority of the aneurysm to vertebral body diameter ratio as a discriminator of ruptured aneurysms. It appears that aneurysm diameter alone is not sufficiently predictive of rupture to be used as the sole indication for elective resection.",

Primary failure occurred in 92 grafts during follow-up, including 22 (4.8%) with nonocclusive stenosis and 70 (15.4%) with occlusion. The cause for failure could not be determined in seven grafts; 104 contributory causes were identified in the remaining 85 grafts. Among the 104 likely causes, 66 (63%) were intrinsic to the graft itself and contributed to failure of 55 (12.1%) of 455 grafts. These causes included perianastomotic stenosis (48), vein stricture (14), focal vein stenosis (10), valvulotome injury (9), kink (6), retained valve leaflet (4), intimal flap (3), and residual arteriovenous fistula (2). Among these intrinsic causes, 20 were directly related to the in situ technique, contributing to failure of 15 (3.3%) of 455 grafts. Thirty-eight (37%) of the 104 causes were extrinsic to the graft, including compromised inflow (2) or outflow (19), hypercoagulability (9), systemic hypotension (6), and graft sepsis (2). Hypothetically, improvements in technique, patient selection, and perioperative management might have eliminated 46 (44%) of 104 causes of primary graft failure. Delayed graft and anastomotic stenosis and late progression of outflow disease remain resistant to modern therapy.",

    "abstract": "Our prior anecdotal experience with unsuspected preexisting saphenous vein disease prompted us to study its incidence, its relation to graft failure, and to identify techniques for its detection. Thick-walled, postphlebitic sclerotic occluded, postphlebitic sclerotic recanalized, calcified, and varicose vein lesions were detected in 63 (12%) of 513 infrainguinal vein bypasses. In 13 (2% to 5%) cases, severe saphenous vein disease precluded use of the vein. In the remaining 50 cases, the entire vein or a portion thereof, with minimal or unsuspected disease, was used for bypass. Early graft failures occurred in 10 (20%) of the 50 cases. The cumulative primary patency rate at 30 months for bypasses performed with diseased veins was 32%. This was significantly less than the 73% cumulative primary patency rate for bypasses with veins without detectable disease (p less than or equal to 0.001). Retrospective evaluation of preoperative duplex ultrasonography (n = 21) originally used to evaluate saphenous vein length and diameter correctly identified thick-walled, occluded, calcified, and varicose veins in 62% of cases. Intraoperative methods of vein evaluation included inspection, palpation, irrigation, catheter or valvulotome insertion to identify obstruction, and intraoperative arteriography. Histologic examination of diseased veins demonstrated a spectrum of disease with thickening of the intima and media, vein wall calcification, and luminal recanalization. We conclude that (1) unsuspected preexisting saphenous vein disease occurs in approximately 12% of cases and results in both early and late graft failures; (2) detection, in some cases, is possible with duplex ultrasonography and intraoperative techniques; and (3) diseased veins that are recanalized, calcified, or thick-walled should not be used if an alternative vein is available.",

    "abstract": "Although the predominant location of symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease is the carotid bifurcation, proximal common carotid artery lesions cause similar symptoms. Common carotid artery lesions occur as isolated disease or in tandem with carotid bulb disease. Restoration of carotid artery inflow from subclavian based extraanatomic bypasses should provide adequate reconstruction of these lesions. To evaluate subclavian-carotid artery bypass, a retrospective review of all patients undergoing this procedure from Jan. 1, 1977, to Feb. 20, 1989, was performed. Twenty patients (14 men, 6 women) with a mean age of 60 years were treated. Fifteen patients (75%) were admitted with transient ischemic attacks. Five (25%) had nonfocal symptoms (e.g., dizziness, syncope). Arteriographic evaluation demonstrated severe proximal occlusive disease of the common carotid artery in all cases. Reconstruction bypasses were performed to the carotid bulb (45%), internal carotid artery (30%), and external carotid artery (25%). Four patients underwent endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery in conjunction with subclavian-carotid artery bypass. Bypass conduits included saphenous vein (75%) and prosthetic grafts (25%). Asymptomatic phrenic nerve neuropraxia was identified by postoperative chest radiography in four cases, with no resultant respiratory disease. No perioperative strokes occurred. One postoperative death (5%) resulted from a myocardial infarction. Long-term results were available for 18 patients (90%), with a mean follow-up of 50 months (range, 1 to 122 months). Four patients have died of causes unrelated to carotid vascular disease. Serial duplex scans have documented graft patency in all 18 patients. A single patient returned with focal neurologic symptoms as a result of a posterior circulation infarct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The geometry was visualized by use of a casting procedure. General hemodynamic and geometric parameters in the abdominal aorta were comparable to values found in humans. The porcine trifurcation differed somewhat from the human bifurcation. The velocity measurements in the abdominal aorta showed consistently skewed velocity profiles with the highest velocities at the anterior vessel wall. No signs of developed turbulence were found. Velocity measurements in the external iliac vessels showed high velocities at the flow divider, and low velocities with signs of retrograde flow during part of diastole at the lateral vessel wall.",

    "abstract": "To increase the efficacy of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in vascular surgery an experimental study including topical application of the gentamicin derivative EMD 46/217 and fibrin sealant as antibiotic carrier to Dacron prostheses was initiated. In vitro treatment of Dacron with gentamicin and fibrin was followed by constant antibiotic release for 3 weeks. In a subsequent animal study Dacron grafts were implanted in the aorta of 10 pigs after direct contamination with Staphylococcus aureus solution. One graft was pretreated with the antibiotic/fibrin compound, a second with the antibiotic alone. Grafts 3 (no pretreatment) and 4 (fibrin alone) served as controls. After 1 week the grafts and their corresponding implantation sites were excised for measurement of antibiotic content and for culture. The antibiotic content of grafts with the antibiotic/fibrin compound was 25.0 +/- 7.2 micrograms/gm wet weight, whereas Dacron pretreated with the antibiotic alone contained no measurable drug amounts except for one specimen (0.5 microgram/gm) (antibiotic/fibrin vs antibiotic, p less than .0005). The corresponding implantation sites to antibiotic/fibrin grafts contained 1.07 +/- 0.54 microgram/gm antibiotic, whereas in only 2/10 implantation sites of antibiotic grafts low antibiotic levels were found (0.05 and 0.2 microgram/gm) (antibiotic/fibrin vs antibiotic, p less than 0.005). All control grafts and 9/10 antibiotic grafts were infected. By contrast, only five were contaminated, and 5 of 10 remained sterile after culture (antibiotic/fibrin vs antibiotic, p less than 0.05). This finding correlates with the antibiotic content in the Dacron. It is concluded that pretreatment of prosthetic Dacron grafts with the antibiotic/fibrin compound results in binding of sufficient amounts of antibiotic for at least 1 week.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Conscientious surveillance of intrainguinal bypass grafts is mandatory to detect vein graft stenoses, which, if uncorrected, can lead to graft occlusion. It is now widely accepted that noninvasive vascular laboratory studies are the best way to detect these lesions. However, controversy still exists over treatment, specifically whether balloon angioplasty is an acceptable substitute for surgery (patch angioplasty or short jump grafts) in the treatment of these lesions. We have always favored balloon angioplasty as primary treatment and have summarized our experience with treating 72 stenotic reversed femoropopliteal and femorotibial vein grafts, which represent 12% of 521 bypass grafts performed at our institution. Prosthetic and in situ grafts are specifically excluded from this report, as well as occluded grafts, found to have stenotic lesions after lytic therapy. The most common stenotic lesion occurred within 4 cm of the proximal anastomosis (29/72 = 40%). The other sites were near the distal anastomosis (7/72 = 10%), and in the middle of the graft (15/72 = 12%). Eighty-one percent (58/72) of the lesions were treated initially by balloon angioplasty with a 31% recurrence. Twenty-nine percent of the 14 grafts treated surgically by vein patch angioplasty or short jump grafts experienced recurrence. Overall 61% (44/72) of the stenotic grafts were treated by balloon angioplasty alone. The 5-year life-table assisted primary patency after correction of the stenotic lesion was 61%. The patency of the grafts from the time of initial bypass surgery, however, was 80%. Location of the stenosis within the graft was a major determinant of patency. Lesions in the proximal graft, proximal anastomosis, and distal graft taken as a group had significantly better patency than the midgraft and distal anastomotic lesions (5-year patency, 65% vs 48%, p less than 0.001 log rank test). We continue to recommend balloon angioplasty as primary therapy for vein graft stenosis except for those occurring in the midgraft and distal anastomosis. Fortunately, this group accounts for only 36% of lesions seen with reversed veins. Recurrent stenosis after balloon angioplasty should be repaired surgically.",

    "abstract": "Seeding vascular prostheses with enzymatically harvested endothelial cells can create endothelial linings that improve small-caliber prosthetic patency. But crude bacterial collagenases used for endothelial harvest contain cytotoxic nonspecific proteases and clostridial cell wall debris which might limit their clinical usefulness. We therefore compared the endothelial cell harvest efficiency of crude bacterial collagenase with that of purified bacterial collagenase alone, purified trypsin alone, and combinations of purified bacterial collagenase and trypsin using concentrations of pure collagenase equal in collagenolytic activity to the crude bacterial collagenase material. The efficiency of harvest from human saphenous vein segments was measured by a microtiter well-growth curve assay of the number of living endothelial cells capable of attachment to fibronectin and subsequent growth obtained per unit area of saphenous vein lumen. Whereas pure collagenase and purified trypsin alone both harvested less than 5% of the baseline endothelial cell density on the veins, a combination of purified collagenase and 0.01% w/v purified trypsin was found to harvest 22% +/- 10% (SD) (n = 8 veins) of the approximately 1.3 x 10(5) endothelial cells/cm2 available on normal saphenous veins. This figure was not statistically different from the harvest efficiency of 19% +/- 10% (N = 4 veins) (p greater than 0.05) obtained by use of 0.1% w/v crude collagenase alone. This result suggests that endothelial harvesting can be done with a defined mixture of pure enzymes which would be clinically preferable to presently used crude extracts of clostridial cultures as a standardized preparation for graft seeding.",

Because of radiation-induced retroperitoneal fibrosis, midureteral obstruction, and prior pelvic and abdominal surgery, primary ureteral repair was not possible, and renal autotransplantation was performed.

The superior mesenteric artery was repaired by means of either a bypass graft in two cases or an endoaneurysmorraphy in the latter two cases. Complete symptomatic relief with no postoperative complications was achieved in every case. The arterial repairs remained patent, and the patients remained free of symptoms, with follow-up ranging from 6 to 47 months. The available literature on this unusual lesion is reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports have documented excellent results for inframalleolar reconstructions. We reviewed our outcomes for dorsalis pedis bypass and report a more modest rate of success. We analyzed reasons for failure. Sixty-nine patients underwent 73 dorsalis pedis bypass procedures between 1984 and 1991. Seventy-eight percent of the patients were diabetics. Inflow was from the external iliac in 1, femoral in 35, popliteal in 34, and tibial in 3. The operative indication was gangrene in 57%, ulcer in 22%, and rest pain in 21%. Forty-six percent of limbs had foot infection, with six requiring minor amputation before the bypass and 24 requiring minor amputation after bypass. There was one perioperative death. Twenty-nine grafts failed over the course of the series. The primary patency rate at 2 years was 59.2%. The limb salvage rate was 73.5%. Of the 10 perioperative failures, four were due to continued foot infection, four to marginal vein quality, and two to skin necrosis of the bypass incisions. Graft failure occurred at 3 to 30 months in 10 of 14 patients who had deficient anterior arches, with segmental occlusion of the dorsalis pedis or its branches. Six of the 14 patients with extensive infections of the forefoot or extensive heel ulcers required amputation with patent bypasses. In dorsalis pedis bypass, failure to achieve limb salvage was more likely in patients with marginal vein quality, deficient anterior pedal arches, and extensive foot infection. In patients where the chance of failure appears to be unacceptably high, primary amputation should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Long vein bypass from the femoral artery to the level of the ankle may be performed with good initial success despite extreme bypass length and limited outflow tracts. However, the long-term performance of these bypasses remains to be defined. During the last 10 years we have performed single greater saphenous vein in situ bypass to the ankle level in 270 patients. There were 187 male and 83 female patients, and 61% of the patients were diabetic. The operative mortality rate was 3.7%. Cumulative bypass patency was 79% at 3 years and 73% at 5 years. In a similar manner, limb salvage was 93% at 3 years and 89% at 5 years. The patency rate was similar for various inflow arteries (common femoral, 88 cases; proximal superficial femoral, 135 cases; and deep femoral, 41 cases) and outflow tracts (dorsal pedal, 72 cases; anterior tibial, 59 cases; posterior tibial, 72 cases, and peroneal, 67 cases). Short bypasses, composite bypasses, free-vein grafts, and bypasses proximal to 10 cm above the ankle were excluded from this analysis. These data show that a long bypass to the ankle level for limb salvage is a durable procedure. The basic concept of bypassing all occlusive disease to the distal open artery in patients undergoing limb salvage should be an acceptable dictum. Excellent long-term patency and limb salvage rates are achievable by following this principle.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to evaluate the results of peripheral vascular reconstruction for arterial occlusive disease in patients with juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus. The results of 67 bypass procedures performed on 60 patients with juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus between Jan. 1, 1984 and Dec. 31, 1989, were reviewed. These patients had a mean age of 44.4 years (range, 29 to 59 years), with an average age of onset of diabetes mellitus of 9.8 years (range, 1 to 19 years). These procedures comprised 5.5% (67 to 1214) of the bypasses performed on diabetic patients during the same time period at a single institution. Fifty-four of 67 (91%) procedures were performed for limb salvage. Fifty-four (81%) procedures were primary infrainguinal bypasses with saphenous vein (femoropopliteal 19, femorodistal or popliteal-distal 35). Six procedures (9%) were revision procedures, four (6%) were in-flow procedures, and three (4%) were infrainguinal procedures with polytetrafluoroethylene. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality rates were 31% and 0%, respectively. Actuarial patency and limb salvage rates of the primary vein graft group were 66.0% (+/- 10.7) and 83.4% (+/- 8.0%), respectively, at 24 months. Cumulative survival of the entire group at 2 years was 84.1%. Although follow-up in this study is relatively short (24 months), the results suggest that the outcome of vascular reconstruction in patients with juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus is acceptable when compared with procedures performed in adult-onset diabetic and nondiabetic populations. The presence of juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus should not diminish the vascular surgeon's expectations of a successful outcome when considering lower extremity revascularization in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Seventy-four patients (70 men [95%], 4 women [5%], mean age, 63 years) with severe, acute lower limb ischemia (acute clinical deterioration and absent pedal Doppler signals) caused by either arterial thrombosis (n = 68) or embolism (n = 6) underwent urgent surgical management consisting of operative revascularization with or without amputation in 67 patients (91%) and primary amputation alone in 7 patients (9%). Sixty-one patients (82%) had severely threatened limb viability, and 13 (18%) had major irreversible ischemic limb changes at presentation. Eighty-six percent of patients were initially anticoagulated with heparin. Seventy percent underwent preoperative angiography. Surgical revascularization included 42 inflow and 20 outflow arterial reconstructions and 9 thrombectomy or embolectomy procedures. Mean follow-up was 17 months (range, 0 to 64). Life-table primary patency at 36 months for arterial reconstructions was 81% for inflow and 78% for outflow procedures. Cumulative limb salvage was 70% at 1 month and 68% at 36 months. Patient survival was 85% at 1 month and 51% at 36 months. No death was directly attributable to complications related to limb reperfusion, and no patient required dialysis for myoglobinuria. We conclude that management of severe, acute lower limb ischemia with early amputation of nonviable limbs and heparinization, angiography, and prompt operative revascularization for threatened but viable extremities minimizes morbidity and mortality rates, while maximizing limb salvage. These results may be useful for comparison with comparable groups of patients treated with thrombolytic or endovascular modalities.",

    "abstract": "From December 1986 to December 1990, 268 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis were studied in our laboratory. From this group 107 patients (123 legs with deep vein thrombosis) were placed in our long-term follow-up program. The documentation of valvular reflux and its site was demonstrated by duplex scanning. The duplex studies were done at intervals of 1 and 7 days, 1 month, every 3 months for the first year, and then yearly thereafter. The mean follow-up time for these patients was 341 days. In addition, reflux was evaluated in 502 patients with negative duplex study results and no previous history of deep vein thrombosis or chronic venous insufficiency. In the patients with acute deep vein thrombosis, valvular incompetence was noted in 17 limbs (14%) at the time of the initial study. Reflux was absent in 106 limbs (86%). In this last group reflux developed in 17% of the limbs by day 7. By the end of the first month, 37% demonstrated reflux. By the end of the first year, more than two thirds of the involved limbs had developed valvular incompetence. The distribution of reflux at the end of the first year of follow-up was the following: (1) popliteal vein, 58%; (2) superficial femoral vein, 37%; (3) greater saphenous vein, 25%; and (4) posterior tibial vein, 18%. Reflux seems to be more frequent in the segments previously affected with deep vein thrombosis. Among cases where segments were initially affected with thrombi, after 1 year the incidence of reflux was 53%, 44%, 59%, and 33% for the common femoral vein, superficial femoral, popliteal vein, and posterior tibial vein, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Compared with conventional duplex imaging, color-flow scanning facilitates the identification of veins (especially below the knee), decreases the need to assess Doppler flow patterns and venous compressibility, and allows veins to be surveyed longitudinally. These advantages translate into a less demanding and time-consuming examination. This study was designed to determine the accuracy of color-flow scanning for detecting acute deep venous thrombosis in patients in whom the diagnosis is clinically suspected and in asymptomatic patients at high risk for developing postoperative deep venous thrombosis. The diagnostic group included 77 limbs of 75 patients, and the surveillance group included 190 limbs of 99 patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement. All patients were prospectively examined with color-flow scanning and phlebography. In the diagnostic group, the incidence of thrombi in below-knee veins (47%) was approximately equal to that in above-knee veins (43%); but in the surveillance group, the incidence of thrombi in below-knee veins (41%) far exceeded that in veins above the-knee (3%). Nonocclusive clots and clots isolated to a single venous segment were more common in the surveillance group. In symptomatic patients, color-flow scanning was 100% sensitive and 98% specific above the knee and 94% sensitive and 75% specific below the knee. In the surveillance group, color-flow scanning was significantly (p less than 0.001) less sensitive (55%) for detecting thrombi, 93% of which were confined to the tibioperoneal veins. Negative predictive values were 100% and 88% for the diagnostic and surveillance limbs, respectively. Positive predictive values were 80% for the diagnostic limbs and 89% for the surveillance limbs. Color-flow scanning effectively excludes above-knee deep venous thrombosis in symptomatic patients and asymptomatic high-risk patients and predicts the presence of above-knee thrombi in patients in the diagnostic group with reasonable accuracy (97%). We conclude that color-flow scanning is as accurate as conventional duplex imaging and, because of its advantages, is the noninvasive method of choice for evaluating patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. Its role in the surveillance of patients at high risk remains to be determined and awaits further clinical evaluation.",

    "abstract": "We prospectively compared the differences in perioperative cardiac ischemic events in 140 patients undergoing major abdominal (n = 53) versus infrainguinal (n = 87) vascular operations. Preoperative dipyridamole thallium cardiac scintigraphy was performed in a subset of 38 of these patients, with treating physicians blinded to the test results. Myocardial ischemia was measured during operation with use of continuous 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and transesophageal echocardiography. Continuous two-lead ambulatory ECG (Holter monitoring) was performed before, during, and after operation for 4 days. Outcome events were cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, ventricular tachycardia, and congestive heart failure. Results of the study indicated that most demographic variables, such as age, hypertension, cigarette smoking, serum cholesterol, were comparable between patients having aortic or infrainguinal arterial operations. However, in the infrainguinal group more patients had diabetes, second vascular operations, angina pectoris, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and used digitalis. Abnormalities in preoperative Holter monitoring, ECGs, and thallium scan abnormalities were equivalent between groups. During operation, whereas Holter and ECG abnormalities were comparable, more patients undergoing aortic procedures suffered ischemia as determined by transesophageal echocardiography (26% vs 10%, p = 0.019). After operation there were 21 (24%) outcome events in patients having infrainguinal bypasses compared with 15 (28%) patients having aortic procedures (p = NS). Ischemia by Holter monitoring (n = 133) occurred after operation in 46 (57%) patients having infrainguinal operations compared with 16 (31%) patients having aortic reconstructions (p = 0.005). Because preoperative cardiac disease and adverse cardiac outcomes occurred with similar or even greater frequency in both groups of patients, we conclude that the risk for postoperative cardiac ischemic events in lower extremity vascular operations is at least as great as for aortic operations.",

    "abstract": "Although the reported incidence of intraabdominal paraanastomotic aneurysms after abdominal aortic bypass grafting ranges from 1% to 15%, the true incidence is unknown because few studies have used routine, serial radiographic or sonographic imaging studies. Since July 1, 1988, we have used yearly abdominal sonography examinations to monitor our patients with aortic grafts. In the first 33 months we studied 138 patients. Medical records of 111 of these were available for review and form the basis of this report. Eleven patients (10%) were found to have intraabdominal paraanastomotic aneurysms ranging in overall size from 4.1 to 6.2 cm (mean, 5.0 +/- 0.7 cm). The mean time between operation and detection of an aneurysm was 144 +/- 101 months (range, 8 to 336 months). Three paraanastomotic aneurysms occurred within 3 years of operation, and the remaining eight occurred late (7 to 28 years). By life-table analysis, the incidence of paraanastomotic aneurysms was 27% at 15 years. Paraanastomotic aneurysms were classified as either pseudoaneurysms (presumed disruption of the anastomotic suture line, n = 7) or as true aneurysms (widening of the adjacent aorta, n = 4). True aneurysms occurred only after repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, whereas pseudoaneurysms were more frequent after bypass for occlusive disease. The finding of paraanastomotic aneurysms in 10% of our patients supports the use of yearly sonography for routine follow-up after aortic grafting.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in the operative management of acute traumatic thoracic aortic aneurysm have resulted in safe and expeditious repair. Nonetheless, multisystem injuries continue to inflict significant numbers of deaths. From 1970 to 1990, 108 patients with acute traumatic thoracic aortic aneurysm were evaluated. Mean injury severity score, excluding aortic injury, was 17.5. Ninety-three patients (86%) survived beyond initial resuscitation and came to operation. Median interval from injury to aortic repair was 8 hours (range, 2 hours to 19 days); there were five operative deaths. Lethal nonaortic injuries included 18 closed head injuries, four myocardial contusions, two intraabdominal vascular injuries, and one pulmonary contusion. The overall mortality rate was 39% of total admissions (42 of 108), and 29% of survivors of resuscitation (27 of 93). It is significant that only 11 of the 42 deaths (26%) were directly attributable to thoracic aortic aneurysm. Adjuncts to prevent spinal cord ischemia (shunt/bypass) were used in 76 patients, whereas 12 underwent clamp/repair. Postoperative paraplegia developed in 5 of 79 patients (6.8%, including 4 of 68 (5.9%) repaired with shunt/bypass and 1 of 11 (9.1%) repaired with clamp/repair (p = NS). Among those who developed paraplegia, the injury severity score was 27.0, and the median interval from injury to repair was 4.9 hours (range, 2 to 6.5). Intraoperative hypotension occurred in three of five patients with paraplegia. Death in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm is due primarily to associated injuries and has remained relatively constant over the 20-year period of review. Overall injury severity, intraoperative hypotension, and extensive aortic tissue destruction may correlate with the development of postoperative paraplegia; however, a larger population sample is required to confirm this conclusion. A plea is made for standardized reporting of all patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm.",

Twelve patients with invasion of the carotid artery by cancer had en bloc resection of the artery and tumor. Reconstruction after in-line carotid artery grafting with autogenous vein was completed with a myocutaneous flap. No neurologic events occurred perioperatively or during the follow-up period of 3 to 50 months. Computed tomography and arteriography were unreliable in predicting tumor involvement of the carotid artery. Three patients died during the study--two of unrelated causes, and one of metastases. None of the patients showed evidence of local recurrence from 3 to 50 months. In two of four wound infections the carotid artery graft was exposed. This was successfully treated by a myocutaneous flap. The mean survival for the group was 18 months. Resection and in-line bypass grafting of the carotid artery invaded by cancer can safely be performed in irradiated and potentially infected fields.",

    "abstract": "The role of preoperative screening for carotid artery disease in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures is not clearly established. This prospective study was designed to determine the prevalence of carotid disease in this population and to identify preoperative risk factors for carotid artery stenosis. During a 54-month interval, 1087 patients of a consecutive series of 1184 patients 65 years of age and older who underwent cardiac surgical procedures (91% had coronary artery disease) were evaluated before operation with carotid duplex ultrasonography. The prevalence of disease was 17.0% for 50% or greater stenosis and 5.9% for 80% or greater stenosis. With use of a stepwise, logistic regression model of 12 preoperative variables, five variables were found by multivariate analysis to be significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) predictors of 80% or greater stenosis: female sex, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, smoking history, and left main coronary artery disease. If all patients with at least one risk factor were screened, then this model predicts that 95% of patients with 80% or greater stenosis and 91% of patients with 50% or greater stenosis would be identified before operation. The probability of carotid disease in a given patient can also be estimated (range, 5% to 65%). Carotid endarterectomy combined with cardiac surgical procedures was performed on 46 patients who were either symptomatic (16) or had 80% or greater stenosis (30). The overall stroke rate for the 1087 patients was 2.0% (22 patients), and the 30-day mortality rate was 5.2% (56 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This pilot study was initiated to determine whether heparin-induced thrombocytopenia occurs in the newborn and whether thromboembolic complications in the newborn could be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Thirty-four infants in whom thrombocytopenia (less than 70,000/mm3) (n = 23), precipitous (30% to 50%) fall in platelet count (n = 5), or thromboses (n = 6) developed while they were receiving heparin were studied. Heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies were demonstrated in 14 infants by platelet aggregation testing. The average gestational age (29 +/- 6 weeks); birth weight (1300 +/- 945 gm); and platelet count at birth (234,000/mm3 +/- 111,000/mm3) of these 14 infants did not differ statistically from the 20 infants without heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies. An umbilical artery catheter was inserted in all infants except a single patient from each group. Aortic thrombosis was documented by abdominal ultrasonography in 11 of 13 (85%) infants with heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies. One patient died with a midgut volvulus before the aorta could be examined. Five aortic thromboses were detected in the 20 infants without heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies. Bleeding was not associated with the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. One patient with previously demonstrated thrombocytopenia and heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies had recurrent thrombocytopenia when reexposed to heparin; her platelet count recovered after heparin withdrawal. Thus heparin-induced thrombocytopenia does occur in preterm and term infants receiving heparin and is associated with arterial thromboses. Therefore infants receiving any form or amount of heparin must be carefully monitored for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.1+",

    "abstract": "Infected lower extremity bypass grafts have been associated with high rates of limb loss. Traditionally treatment has included graft excision. To compare aggressive local treatment, without graft removal, with more conventional graft excision, we reviewed 38 consecutive patients with 39 infected lower extremity bypasses treated during the last 10 years. The grafts used were prosthetic in 33 cases, vein in 4, and composite in 2. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Twenty-eight infected grafts were treated with either complete (14) or partial (14) graft removal. Nine new grafts were placed. Recurrent infection developed in five cases, and two patients died of complications of graft infection. Ten of 20 limbs at risk were lost. Eleven patients with patent bypasses (4 vein, 2 composite, 5 prosthetic) were treated without graft excision. Treatment of five patients in this group included muscle transposition. Five patients were treated with incision and drainage of abscesses, and one had excision of a persistent sinus tract. One patient underwent major amputation 6.3 years after treatment of graft infection. Limb salvage was significantly higher (p = 0.012, log-rank test) than in patients treated with graft excision. One patient died, and no recurrent infections developed; these were not significant differences compared with those having graft excision. We conclude that aggressive local treatment of infected lower extremity bypass grafts, including drainage, debridement, and muscle transposition may treat infection in selected patients without the need for graft removal and with rates of limb salvage superior to those obtained with excisional therapy.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent claudication may occur in well-conditioned athletes because of an unusual form of popliteal artery entrapment that results from overtraining. These patients complain of calf muscle cramping, rapid limb fatigue, and occasional paresthesias on the plantar surface of the foot when running on inclines or when repetitive jumping is performed. Results of plethysmographic screening tests for popliteal entrapment are positive in these patients. Magnetic resonance angiography and intravenous digital subtraction angiography studies, however, do not demonstrate findings typical of anatomic popliteal entrapment. No evidence exists of aberrant positioning of the popliteal artery in foot neutral positioning, but with forced plantar flexion, the neurovascular bundle is deviated and compressed laterally. Surgical exploration of the popliteal fossa demonstrates no obvious musculotendinous abnormality. Symptoms of claudication and arterial compression are relieved by surgical release of the soleus muscle from its tibial attachments, resection of its fascial band, and resection of the plantaris muscle.",

    "abstract": "We performed lower extremity arterial duplex mapping from the aortic bifurcation to the ankle in 150 consecutive patients evaluated for aortic and lower extremity arterial reconstruction and compared lower extremity arterial duplex mapping in a blinded fashion to angiography. On the basis of history, physical examination, and four-cuff segmental Doppler pressures individual lower extremities were classified as normal, isolated aortoiliac disease, infrainguinal disease, and multilevel inflow and outflow disease. For vessels proximal to the tibial arteries, lower extremity arterial duplex mapping was analyzed for its ability to insonate individual arterial segments, detect a 50% or greater stenosis, and distinguish stenosis from occlusion. In the tibial arteries lower extremity arterial duplex mapping was evaluated for its ability to visualize tibial vessels and to predict interruption of tibial artery patency from origin to ankle. Lower extremity arterial duplex mapping visualized 99% of arterial segments proximal to the tibial vessels, with overall sensitivities for detecting a 50% or greater lesion ranging from 89% in the iliac vessels to 67% at the popliteal artery. Stenosis was successfully distinguished from occlusion in 98% of cases. In the tibial vessels lower extremity arterial duplex mapping was better at visualizing anterior tibial and posterior tibial artery segments (94% and 96%) than peroneal artery segments (83%), (p less than 0.001). Overall sensitivities for predicting interruption of tibial artery patency were 90% for the anterior tibial, 90% for the posterior tibial, and 82% for the peroneal. Clinical disease category did not influence in a major way the accuracy of lower extremity arterial duplex mapping in either above-knee or below-knee vessels.",

Increased numbers of activated T cells were found in all three areas. After aneurysm repair, peripheral blood analysis demonstrated normalization of the T-cell subsets. These data suggest that inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with a measurable immune response in peripheral blood with elevation of the same subset of inflammatory cells (CD4) as detected in abdominal aortic aneurysm tissue, and the immune response regresses after aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "To allow and facilitate endoluminal vein preparation under angioscopic guidance for in situ bypass grafting, a Mill's valvulotome was equipped with a flushing channel. The advantages of the novel valvulotome are obvious: it allows perfect angioscopic view within a saphenous vein that still contained blood by adjusting the jet of lactated Ringer's solution directly to the lens of the angioscope; it permits the use of very small angioscopes without integrated flushing channels, preventing endothelial damage. The described technique was tested in 27 peripheral reconstructions in 26 patients. The secondary cumulative patency rate within a follow-up time of 4 to 30 months (mean, 14 months) was 89%. The described technique substantially facilitates in situ bypass grafting and minimizes early and late complications and further improves surgical outcome.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) measurements can be used to predict amputation site healing in lower limbs with arterial occlusive disease. We measured tcPO2 (supine and with limb elevation) in 90 limbs before amputation and reviewed their subsequent clinical course. Of these, 52 (57%) successfully healed, 21 (23%) failed, and 17 (18%) exhibited delayed healing. Limbs with delayed healing or failure had significantly lower tcPO2 values than values of those that healed. A tcPO2 greater than or equal to 40 torr was associated with primary or delayed healing in 51 of 52 limbs (98%), and a tcPO2 value of less than 20 torr was universally associated with failure. For patients with a tcPO2 between 20 and 40 torr, tcPO2 measurements obtained during limb elevation improved the predictability of outcome. We conclude that supine tcPO2 measurements can help predict amputation site healing, and that tcPO2 measurement during limb elevation improves predictability in limbs with borderline supine tcPO2 values.",

    "abstract": "During the last 3 decades subcutaneous extraanatomic bypass, despite its limited durability, has been the favored alternative to infrarenal aortofemoral bypass. Meanwhile, the descending thoracic aorta has been scarcely used as an inflow source for aortoiliac reconstruction. Over the past 8 years we performed 16 bypasses from the descending thoracic aorta to the iliofemoral vessels for occlusive disease. Our experience combined with that found in the English-language literature totaled 141 patients. In 79 patients (56%) the indication for surgery was failure or infection of an abdominal aortofemoral graft. Previous abdominal operations, sepsis, radiation therapy, the presence of abdominal stomas, or an unsuitable infrarenal aorta were the indications in the remaining cases. The combined operative mortality rate was 6.4%. The life-table primary graft patency was 98% at 1 year, 88% at 2 years, and 70.4% at 5 years. Bypass from the descending thoracic aorta to the iliofemoral artery uses an inflow source superior to other extraanatomic reconstructions, does not require aortic cross-clamping, avoids the abdominal cavity, and places the graft remote to the skin and intestine. The operative mortality and patency rates compare favorably to those of other extraanatomic or remedial aortic reconstructions. Descending thoracic aorta to iliofemoral artery bypass is a superb alternative to abdominal aortofemoral bypass, carries a low mortality rate, has an excellent short-term patency, and features unique characteristics for long-term durability.",

Surgical indications included ischemic rest pain or focal tissue necrosis in 25 limbs (71%), disabling claudication in six (17%), and popliteal aneurysms or prosthetic femoropopliteal graft infections each in two (6%). Preliminary arteriovenous fistulas were constructed in the arms of 23 patients (68%) to enhance the diameter of their cephalic veins, and 24 (69%) of the 35 infrainguinal procedures in this series were performed with use of cephalic vein alone. The distal popliteal artery was used for the outflow anastomosis in 10 limbs (29%), a tibial vessel was used in 12 (34%), and the peroneal artery was used in 13 (37%). Fourteen graft occlusions (40%) and six amputations (17%) have occurred during follow-up intervals of 1 to 107 months (mean, 28 months; median, 27 months). At 3 years the cumulative primary patency rate is 40%, the secondary patency rate is 46%, and the limb salvage rate is 82%. Despite their relative inconvenience, cephalic vein grafts appear to be preferable to prosthetic materials for infrainguinal revascularization below the knee.",

    "abstract": "To improve the chances for the amputee to become ambulatory the most distal level of amputation should be selected in patients with end-stage peripheral vascular disease. Physical examination alone provides insufficient information when amputation levels are closely related to areas with signs and symptoms of ischemia. In the present series of 85 lower extremity amputations the predictive values of clinical parameters and skin perfusion pressure measurements are assessed. The role of clinical judgment is clarified: the most distal level of amputation is to be selected by physical examination, but further information is required to assess the healing potential at the selected level. The presence of palpable pulses immediately above the selected level correlates well with primary wound healing (p less than 0.001, negative predictive value 100%). The absence of palpable pulses and angiographic patency scores are of no clinical value in amputation level selection. Skin perfusion pressure measurements were of excellent predictive value (p less than 0.001, positive predictive value 89%, negative predictive value 99%). According to these data a strategy is proposed for routine determination of the lowest level of amputation, where primary wound healing can be expected.",

Twenty-six patients (10 men and 16 women with a mean age of 68.4 years; range, 49 to 80 years) with end stage chronic peripheral vascular disease requiring reoperation were entered into the study. In 13 patients venous endothelial cells were harvested 4 to 7 weeks before operation, grown to confluency in culture flasks, and seeded onto the inner surface of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Thirteen patients received untreated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and served as a control. A scoring system with use of intraarterial angiography was used to assess disease severity. No statistically significant differences in angiographic score were seen between the two groups, indicating comparable severity of disease. Early secondary graft patency (0 to 30 days) was 92% for the in vitro endothelial cell lining group and 53% for control patients. The amputation rate after 18 months for the in vitro endothelial cell lining group was 15%, with a 31% rate in the control group. The functional performance of the in vitro endothelial cell lining bypasses was superior to that of untreated bypass grafts during the observed follow-up period. These early results suggest that in vitro endothelial cell lining is a method that can reduce the early occlusion rate now seen after repeat reconstruction of crural vessels.",

    "abstract": "Autologous saphenous veins are considered the best arterial substitute for lower extremity revascularization in infected fields. The search continues for a vascular conduit in instances when an autologous biologic grafting is not feasible. Herein we report our experience with eight patients in whom cryopreserved saphenous vein allogenic homografts were used in 10 lower extremity arterial reconstructions for limb salvage with coexisting infection. Six patients with eight prosthetic grafts including four femoropopliteal, two femorotibial, a femorofemoral, and a femoroperoneal graft required complete or partial graft excision as a result of overt infection. The two remaining patients included one with an infected femoral pseudoaneurysm and another with extensive chemical burns. All cryopreserved saphenous vein allogenic homografts were of identical match to the ABO/Rh blood groupings of the recipient patients. No immunosuppressive drugs were administered after operation. Mean follow-up was 9.5 months (range, 6.0 to 14.0 months). One patient died 5 weeks after operation with a patent graft. Two grafts occluded during follow-up; in one graft, patency was restored with thrombectomy alone. The remaining seven arterial reconstructions continue to be patent with no evidence of aneurysmal dilation with complete eradication of the primary infection. These preliminary findings suggest that cryopreserved saphenous vein allogenic homografts can serve as interim conduits for lower extremity arterial reconstruction to preserve limb viability when autogenous conduits are unsatisfactory or unavailable. Further definitive reconstruction may thereafter be necessary once sepsis is eradicated and sufficient wound healing is achieved.",

    "abstract": "The effect of increasing doses of dexamethasone on the development of myointimal hyperplasia in the rabbit carotid artery was studied by use of a balloon catheter injury model. Seventy New Zealand white rabbits underwent a standardized 2F balloon catheter stripping of the left carotid intima. The animals were randomly assigned to one of seven groups, each receiving daily injections of either saline (group I, N = 10) or graded doses of dexamethasone: 0.025 mg/kg (group II, N = 10); 0.050 mg/kg (group III, N = 10); 0.075 mg/kg (group IV, N = 10); 0.100 mg/kg (group V, N = 10); 0.125 mg/kg (group VI, N = 10); 0.150 mg/kg (group VII, N = 10). Injections were started 2 days before the intimal injury and continued daily, five times a week, for 8 weeks. The vessels were harvested 12 weeks after injury, and the ratio of the absolute area of intimal hyperplasia to the normalized area enclosed by the internal elastic lamina was measured as an index of myointimal hyperplasia. Also, at the time of harvest, blood flow (ml/min) was measured and the resistance delta P/flow (mm Hg/ml/min) calculated for each vessel in vivo. Twelve-week patency rates were 60% in the control group I, 90% in groups II and III, and 100% in groups IV, V, VI, and VII. The value for the intimal hyperplasia/internal elastic lamina index, expressed as a percent, was 22.2 +/- 3.7 for control group I, 17.7 +/- 2.1 group II, 14.8 +/- 3.0 group III, 12.8 +/- 2.4 group IV, 11.5 +/- 1.8 group V, 5.4 +/- 1.3 group VI, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 for group VII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From January 1983 to September 1990, 2731 carotid endarterectomies were performed at The Cleveland Clinic. Patch angioplasty with autogenous saphenous vein was used for arteriotomy closure during 1691 (62%) of these procedures and was associated with eight postoperative ruptures (0.5%) of the central portion of the patch in seven patients. This complication occurred in three men and in four women (mean age, 69 years), all of whom were hypertensive and all but one were smokers. Two patients (29%) had diabetes. In each case of patch rupture the vein had been harvested from the leg distal to the knee. Although the harvest site could not be determined retrospectively for every patient in this series, no patch ruptures were encountered among 370 procedures for which it could be documented that the saphenous veins had been obtained from the groin. All ruptures occurred within 5 days of the primary operations (including four during the first 24 hours) and were urgently corrected by primary closure of the original arteriotomy in two cases and by replacement of the ruptured patch in the remaining six. Two (29%) of the seven patients either died or sustained a permanent neurologic deficit. Central rupture of a saphenous vein patch is a rare but devastating complication after carotid endarterectomy. Since vein harvested from the lower leg or ankle may be marginally more likely to rupture than proximal vein from the thigh or groin, it should not be used indiscriminately for carotid patch angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Standard therapy for abdominal aortic graft infection involving resection of the graft and extraanatomic bypass carries significant morbidity and mortality rates. The present study evaluates the feasibility of combining in situ graft replacement with a highly vascular tissue flap as an alternative to this problem. In 52 pigs a segment of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft was interposed in the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Staphylococcus aureus was used to infect the graft. One week later the animals were divided into six treatment groups. Group 1 (control) had debridement of the retroperitoneum only; group 2 had debridement with replacement of the graft; group 3 consisted of animals with the infected graft left in place and the graft wrapped with a rectus abdominis flap; group 4 is similar to group 3 except the seromuscularis of the jejunum was used to wrap the infected graft; in group 5 the graft was changed, and a rectus abdominis island flap was wrapped around the graft; and finally, group 6 was similar to group 5 except that the flap was obtained from the seromuscularis of the jejunum. Two weeks later, graft patency and infection status were assessed at reoperation. The incidence of graft infection was significantly reduced in groups 5 (0 of 10; p less than 0.01) and 6 (1 of 10; p less than 0.02) compared with group 1 (7 of 10), and the incidence of graft thrombosis was also greatly reduced in groups 5 (2 of 10) and 6 (1 of 10) versus group 1 (10 of 10; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Leg ulcers caused by chronic venous insufficiency plague an estimated 500,000 Americans, but there have been few improvements in conservative treatment in this century, and Unna's boot continues to be a mainstay of therapy. A recent report suggests that Duoderm CGF dressing provides greater patient comfort and enhanced compliance, but Duoderm alone (without compression) resulted in slower healing compared with Unna's boot. We enrolled 30 patients (30 ulcers) in a clinical trial to compare Duoderm CGF plus compression (Coban wrap) to Unna's boot. No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to age, sex, initial ulcer area, ulcer duration, or extent of venous insufficiency by duplex scan. Eight of 16 ulcers (50%) in the Duoderm group healed completely versus 6 of 14 ulcers (43%) in the Unna's boot group (p = 0.18). Healing rates (square centimeters per week) correlated significantly with initial ulcer area and initial ulcer perimeter for both groups but best correlated with initial ulcer perimeter (r = 0.88 with Duoderm, p less than 0.0001; r = 0.80 with Unna's boot, p less than 0.002). After adjusting for differences in initial ulcer perimeter, healing rates were significantly faster for patients on Duoderm than patients on Unna's boot during the first 4 weeks of therapy (0.384 +/- 0.059 cm2/wk/cm perimeter for Duoderm versus 0.135 +/- 0.043 cm2/wk/cm perimeter for Unna's boot; p = 0.002). At 12 weeks patients on Duoderm again appeared to heal faster than those on Unna's boot, although the result did not reach statistical significance (0.049 +/- 0.007 cm2/wk/cm perimeter for Duoderm versus 0.020 +/- 0.017 for Unna's boot, p = 0.11).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Thrombin, a mediator of thrombosis, has been shown to directly alter the function of vascular cells. We studied the effect of thrombin on low-density lipoprotein permeability and uptake by an arterial endothelial cell-smooth muscle cell bilayer to determine its potential role in atherogenesis. Confluent cell bilayers were incubated in media containing thrombin (10 or 50 units/ml) for a period of 24 hours to 9 days. Iodine 125 (125I)-LDL (10 micrograms protein/ml) was then added to the media, and after a 3-hour incubation, 125I-LDL transit through the endothelial cell layer as well as membrane binding and uptake by each cell type were measured. The lower concentration of thrombin caused a delayed increase in both the permeability (p less than 0.0001) and uptake (p less than 0.05) of LDL, but had no effect on membrane binding of the lipoprotein. The higher thrombin concentration led to an immediate increase in endothelial cell permeability to LDL (p less than 10(-7)) and a significant reduction in both cellular uptake (p less than 10(-7)) and membrane binding (p less than 0.0005). In contrast, smooth muscle cell binding and uptake were unaffected at the lower concentration of thrombin. At the higher concentration, smooth muscle cell uptake of LDL was increased (p less than 10(-7)) disproportionately to a more limited increase in membrane binding (p less than 0.05). Endothelial DNA content, reflecting cell number, was increased at 10 units/ml thrombin (p less than 0.001) but markedly reduced at 50 units/ml thrombin (p less than 0.0005), whereas smooth muscle cell DNA content remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We investigated the localization of experimental anastomotic intimal thickening in relation to known biomechanical and hemodynamic factors. Bilateral iliofemoral saphenous vein and polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were implanted in 13 mongrel dogs. The distal end-to-side anastomotic geometry was standardized, and the flow parameters were measured. After 8 weeks, seven of 10 animals (group I) with patent grafts were killed and the anastomoses fixed by perfusion. Histologic sections from each anastomosis were studied with light microscopy, and regions of intimal thickening were identified and quantitated with use of oculomicrometry. To characterize the anastomotic flow patterns, transparent silicone models were constructed from castings of the distal anastomosis of three animals (group II), and flow was visualized with use of helium-neon laser-illuminated particles under conditions simulating the in vivo pulsatile flow parameters. Histologic sections revealed two separate and distinct regions of anastomotic intimal thickening. The first, suture line intimal thickening, was greater in polytetrafluoroethylene anastomoses (0.35 +/- 0.23 microns) than in vein anastomoses (0.15 +/- 0.03 microns, p less than 0.05). The second distinct type of intimal thickening developed on the arterial floor and was the same in polytetrafluoroethylene (0.11 +/- 0.11 microns) and vein anastomoses (0.12 +/- 0.03 microns). Model flow visualization studies revealed a flow stagnation point along the arterial floor resulting in a region of low and oscillating shear where the second type of intimal thickening developed. High shear and short particle residence time were observed along the hood of the graft, an area devoid of intimal thickening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The advantages of an endothelial cell surface on a prosthetic graft may be compromised by endothelial cell production of mitogens for smooth muscle cells. To study platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) production by cells lining prosthetic grafts, 15 beagles underwent placement of 20 to 22 cm long, 8 mm inner diameter, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene thoracoabdominal aortic grafts, of which seven were seeded with autologous jugular vein endothelial cells, and eight were unseeded control grafts. Grafts and adjacent arteries were explanted after 4 weeks, divided into segments, and studied in organ culture. Platelet-derived growth factor production during a 72-hour incubation period was measured by radioreceptor assay. Midgraft segments of seeded grafts produced significantly more PDGF than control grafts, 43 +/- 8 pg/cm2 and 22 +/- 5 pg/cm2, respectively (mean +/- SEM), p less than 0.05. Platelet-derived growth factor production correlated directly with endothelial cell coverage on graft segments as measured by scanning electron microscopy (r = 0.63, p = 0.01), and inversely with platelet deposition (r = -0.48, p = 0.07). For all dogs, PDGF production by the distal aorta was significantly greater than that by the proximal aorta, 89 +/- 6 and 17 +/- 4 pg/cm2, respectively (p less than 0.0001). These results suggest that endothelial cells on prosthetic vascular grafts are a significant source of PDGF. Furthermore, the higher PDGF production by the distal arteries may offer an explanation for the clinical finding of more severe intimal hyperplasia adjacent to the distal anastomosis.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence points toward local production of renin and angiotensinogen in the artery wall. Because angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to block intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury in the rat, it has been suggested that angiotensin II is an important mediator of the proliferative response to vascular injury. To prove that previous observations with use of ACE inhibitors are a result of effects on local angiotensin levels versus nonspecific drug effects, we tested the ability of an unrelated drug, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin, to similarly block intimal hyperplasia after aortic injury in the rat. Balloon catheter aortic denudation was performed in 28 rats pharmacologically treated for 14 days after surgery and split into four groups: group 1, saralasin 360 micrograms/kg/hr intravenously; group two, normal saline 0.5 mm3/hr intravenously; group 3, captopril 100 mg/kg/day orally; and group 4, heparin 50 U/kg/hr intravenously. Animals were killed and aortas were perfusion fixed at physiologic pressure 14 days after denudation. Cross-sectional intima-to-media ratios were calculated by computerized planimetry. Compared with saline controls, saralasin inhibited intimal hyperplasia 45% (p less than 0.001), captopril 59% (p less than 0.001), and heparin 68% (p less than 0.001). A reduction in total intimal area was also evident in animals treated with saralasin (p less than 0.01). Blood pressure in the group treated with captopril decreased from 107.4 +/- 3.9 to 96.3 +/- 4.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) after 6 days, whereas saralasin and heparin had no effect on blood pressure. Weight gain during the study was reduced in groups treated with captopril and heparin but not in the group treated with saralasin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Platelet adhesion and aggregation are mediated by fibrinogen via the receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, which recognizes the arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) amino-acid sequence. We investigated the ability of 8-guanidino-octanoyl-Asp-Phe (SC-49992), an intravenously infused, stable RGD analogue, to inhibit human platelet function in vitro and to reduce in vivo canine platelet deposition on prosthetic grafts. Human platelet aggregation induced by 10 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner with an ED50 of 1 microgram/ml of SC-49992. Adenosine diphosphate-induced secretion, which is dependent on fibrinogen occupancy of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, was reduced in a concentration dependent manner, also with an ED50 of 1 microgram/ml. Thrombin-induced secretion, which is independent of fibrinogen binding, was unaffected. Activation-dependent platelet adhesion to fibrinogen substrates was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by SC-49992. Platelet adhesion to fibronectin substrates was also reduced by the analogue, but to a lesser extent. SC-49992 effectively eluted glycoprotein IIb/IIIa bound to RGD derivatized sepharose. Eight thrombosis-prone dogs had polytetrafluoroethylene femoral artery grafts placed. Dogs received the RGD analogue or a normal saline infusion during their first graft procedure. One week later a second contralateral femoral graft with infusion of the other agent was performed. Aggregometry during RGD analogue infusion demonstrated inhibition of induced aggregation, whereas normal saline infusion had no effect. As measured by the adherence of platelets labeled with indium III 8-guanidino-octanoyl-Asp-Phe reduced platelet deposition on vascular grafts by more than 90% (p = 0.0006, log transformed data, paired t test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The feature that clearly distinguishes natural blood vessels from their artificial counterparts is the presence of endothelial cell lining that besides being nonthrombogenic is capable of repair and renewal. This study describes a method of coating vascular grafts with a uniform, naturally produced subendothelial extracellular matrix before implantation. This substrate provides a most suitable bilayer for endothelial cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation, as compared with grafts coated with fibronectin or basement membrane extracts. It contains both adhesive glycoproteins (fibronectin, laminin, collagen) and proteoglycans (heparan sulfate) as well as endothelial cell growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor) that support adhesion and normal growth of suboptimal concentrations of endothelial cells. We suggest that the presence in extracellular matrix of both adhesive macromolecules and potent endothelial cell-growth promoting factors will make the extracellular matrix a promising substrate for vascular grafts.",

    "abstract": "A plan for management of infected arterial pseudoaneurysm has evolved from our experience with 23 such aneurysms treated between 1981 and 1989 and followed for up to 66 months. Eighteen femoral artery aneurysms are the primary focus of this report. Because we were concerned about the high probability of amputation expected from acute interruption of the femoral artery, we were reluctant to limit initial management to ligation and debridement alone. However, significant complications developed in 12 patients who underwent revascularization, requiring 3 amputations and 13 secondary arterial operations in addition to debridements and skin grafts. In contrast, no amputations were required in six patients who underwent primary arterial ligation and debridement. We recommend primary ligation that controls the septic focus, removes the danger of hemorrhage, and is not accompanied by the threat of secondary arterial infection. After ligation, limb viability is assessed during surgery by presence of an audible Doppler signal at the ankle. Revascularization is considered only when absence of a Doppler signal indicates acute limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic colitis resulting in colonic infarction after aortic reconstruction is a highly lethal complication. Reimplantation of all patent inferior mesenteric arteries should improve this problem but can be justified only if the procedure is effective and safe. To investigate this, 337 aortic reconstructions done between July 1982 and May 1989 were reviewed. Patent inferior mesenteric arteries had been reimplanted when possible during 151 aortic reconstructions done between April 1986 and May 1989. Before this, patent inferior mesenteric arteries were selectively ligated on the basis of intraoperative bowel inspection, colonic mesenteric Doppler signals, and inferior mesenteric arteries stump pressures during 186 aortic procedures. No patient had colonic infarction as a result of ischemia during the period in which patent inferior mesenteric arteries were reimplanted if possible. In contrast, five patients (2.7%; p less than 0.05) had colonic infarction and perforation during the period of selective inferior mesenteric arteries ligation resulting in four deaths. The operative mortality rate was less during the period of inferior mesenteric arteries reimplantation (4.0% vs 14.5%; p less than 0.05), and transfusion requirements were unchanged. Thus routine reimplantation of patent inferior mesenteric arteries limits colonic infarction and operative deaths after aortic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Major elective peripheral vascular surgery has historically carried a significant risk of perioperative myocardial infarction; this risk has been quantified further by its association with proved reduction in cardiac reserve/presence of coronary artery disease by stress testing or invasive monitoring. Recognition of this risk logically should lead to protocols that delineate coronary artery disease/cardiac reserve before surgery and correct for observed abnormalities during surgery. This study sought to show that a coherent algorithm of preoperative cardiac assessment combined with aggressive perioperative management could indeed reduce perioperative myocardial infarction rates. Six hundred thirty consecutive elective vascular operations were performed by the author during 6 years. All patients were entered into a prospective protocol for preoperative cardiac risk assessment, which then determined the choice of operation, type of anesthesia, and level of hemodynamic monitoring. Sixty-eight percent of the patients demonstrated clinical coronary artery disease, 15% had previously undergone coronary catheterization or surgery, and 9% had ejection fractions less than 35%. All patients underwent baseline detailed cardiac histories, radionuclide cardioangiography, and electrocardiograms. Patients with significant historic coronary artery disease or ejection fraction less than 50% underwent stress thallium testing; patients with positive fixed or redistribution defects then underwent catheterization, constituting 7% of the series. Risk stratification by age and cardiac assessment then dictated the perioperative care. The overall perioperative myocardial infarction rate was 0.7% (5/628), ranging from 0% for 156 aortic operations and 114 carotid endarterectomies to 0.6% for 159 femoropopliteal and 3.3% for 90 femorotibial revascularizations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Aortic and renal vascular reconstruction often involve significant renal ischemia. Profound hypothermia during renal ischemia preserves renal tissue. However, in the clinical setting of vascular reconstruction specific attempts at cooling the kidney are often impractical, and renal ischemia frequently occurs at physiologic temperatures. This study demonstrates that minimal temperature changes during renal ischemia alter the functional and morphologic outcome. Rats anesthetized with halothane underwent a right nephrectomy and placement of a snare around the left renal pedicle for 45 minutes to produce renal ischemia. Seventy-five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 250 to 350 gm were divided into three groups based on the body temperature maintained during renal ischemia (35 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C). Body temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal thermistor and maintained by adjustment of a heating pad and lamp. Two postischemic protocols were followed including a creatinine assessment protocol with blood samples collected at 24, 48, and 72 hours and a histologic assessment protocol with biopsy of the kidney at 30 hours. At 24 hours after ischemia plasma creatinine concentrations were increased in rats with elevated body temperatures (35 degrees C vs 37 degrees C; [p = 0.001], 37 degrees C vs 39 degrees C; [p = 0.150]). The 30-hour histologic assessment indicated a difference in morphologic outcome (35 degrees C vs 37 degrees C; [p = 0.063], 37 degrees C vs 39 degrees C; [p = 0.016]), with proximal tubular morphology being better maintained at lower temperatures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Patients with lower limb ischemia who require reoperation for failed vascular reconstructive surgery can benefit from a surgical technique in which an artificial graft is used and an arteriovenous fistula is created at the site of the distal anastomosis, followed by ligation of the proximal vein. This technique was used in 30 patients who had undergone vascular reconstruction with bypasses from the femoral to the distal tibial, peroneal, or dorsal pedal arteries. Angiography showed occlusion of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries in all patients with reconstitution of only one small segment in the anterior tibial (n = 12), posterior tibial (n = 11), peroneal (n = 5), or dorsal pedal artery (n = 2). All patients had rest pain and necrosis. Artificial grafts were required because of the absence of autogenous vein. Immediate postoperative graft patency was achieved in all 30 patients. The mean ankle/arm pressure index increased from 0.30 +/- 0.24 to 0.79 +/- 0.31 (p less than 0.01). Graft patency computed by the life-table method was 71% at both 1- and 2-year follow-up. Foot salvage was achieved in 25 of 30 patients after surgery. The results of this study indicate that an aggressive vascular surgical approach in patients with severe ischemia and previous failed bypass procedures is justified. In the absence of autogenous vein, the combination of a prosthetic graft and a distal arteriovenous fistula with ligation of the proximal vein increases graft patency.",

To examine progress in diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcome, we retrospectively reviewed data of 13 patients, 12 women and one man (mean age, 55 years; range, 19 to 75 years), who in the last 35 years underwent surgical treatment for primary venous leiomyosarcoma at our institution. The tumor arose from the inferior vena cava in eight, iliac vein in two, ovarian vein in one, and greater saphenous vein in two patients. Primary venous leiomyosarcoma was detected by physical examination in nine patients, symptoms were present in six. The 13 patients underwent 16 surgical procedures to resect primary (12), recurrent (2), or metastatic (2) tumors. Local excision alone was performed in seven, and local excision with reconstruction of the inferior vena cava or iliac vein was performed in six patients. The tumor was greater than 10 cm in eight patients. The perioperative mortality rate was 15% (2 of 13). Median survival of the 11 early survivors was 3.5 years (range, 6 months to 17 years). Currently five patients are alive (four of them free of known tumor), with a median survival of 3 years (6 months to 17 years) after surgery. Of the eight deceased patients, primary venous leiomyosarcoma recurred after resection in six. Tumor recurrence was not affected by tumor grade, size, or adjuvant treatment. Although early detection with modern imaging techniques could potentially be of benefit, wide local excision with selective venous reconstruction affords the only hope for prolonged survival.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia is a well-known cause of hypertension whose presence is confirmed by its typical arteriographic appearance. The functional significance of these lesions is often difficult to determine, particularly when both renal arteries are involved. Duplex scanning has been shown to be accurate for the detection of renal artery stenosis and estimation of the degree of narrowing. To test whether duplex scanning results after intervention correlate with clinical outcome, we reviewed the studies on nine patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia who had been treated by either angioplasty or surgery. A total of 18 arteries were treated. Fourteen of the 18 treatments were successful as measured by a reduction in blood pressure and antihypertensive drugs. In four instances treatment was unsuccessful. For those patients who had clinical improvement, the hemodynamic parameters from the renal artery also improved. In the patients for whom treatment failed, the velocities recorded from the site of narrowing did not improve after intervention. Thus it appears that duplex scanning along with the clinical results may be used to document the basis for failing to improve after treatment be it angioplasty or operation.",

    "abstract": "The antithrombotic effects of standard heparin were compared with those of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and hirudin by use of an in vitro perfusion system. Fresh blood collected from human volunteers was treated with varying doses of these three agents and perfused in a recirculating system over everted porcine vein segments. A low shear rate (100/sec) was selected to simulate conditions in large arteries and veins. Platelet and fibrinogen deposition were evaluated with indium 111 and iodine 125 radiolabels, respectively. Anticoagulant activity was assessed by measuring the activated clotting time (ACT). Anti-Xa activity was assayed to determine the degree to which these agents used antithrombin III pathways. Low-molecular-weight heparin was the weakest anticoagulant, requiring 32 micrograms/ml blood to double the ACT. By contrast, the ACT doubled with only 0.75 and 1.10 micrograms/ml blood of heparin and hirudin, respectively. Heparin and hirudin inhibited platelet and fibrin deposition at equivalent doses. Low-molecular-weight heparin was a less potent inhibitor of fibrin than heparin or hirudin. Hirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, exhibited minimal anti-Xa activity, contrasted with 0.14 anti-Xa units/micrograms for LMWH and 0.13 anti-Xa units/mg for heparin. These data suggest that heparin and hirudin are more potent anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents than LMWH.",

    "abstract": "The records of 231 patients (189 men, 42 women) treated during the last decade for ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm were reviewed to evaluate complications and mortality rates and to determine if preoperative factors would preclude attempt at surgical repair. Mean age was 73.7 years (range, 50 to 95 years). Fifty-seven patients (24.7%) were greater than or equal to 80 years of age. Sixty-eight patients (29.4%) had known abdominal aortic aneurysm before rupture. Preoperative systolic blood pressure was less than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 155 patients (67.1%). Fifty-six patients (24.2%) had cardiac arrest before operation. The overall mortality rate from admission until the end of the hospital stay was 49.4% (114 of 231). Seventeen patients (7.4%) died in the emergency department, 40 (17.3%) in the operating room, 27 (11.7%) during the first 48 postoperative hours, and 30 (13.0%) died later but during the same hospitalization. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 41.6%. Mean age of those who died was higher (75.3 years) than of those who survived (72.2 years) (p less than 0.02). Of patients greater than or equal to 80 years, 43.9% survived. Survival was lower among women (35.7%) than men (54.0%; p less than 0.04). A high APACHE II score, a low initial hematocrit, preoperative hypotension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated multivariately with increased mortality rates (p less than 0.02). However, 59 of the 155 patients (38.1%) with preoperative hypotension survived. Deaths were high (80.4%) among patients with cardiac arrest (45 of 56); still, 28.2% of patients (11 of 39) survived repair after cardiac arrest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Wound complications after in situ saphenous vein bypass occur frequently, lengthen hospitalization, and threaten graft viability. From May 1981 to March 1991, 117 consecutive male patients underwent 126 in situ operations: 45 (36%) femoropopliteal, 75 (59%) femorotibial, and 6 (5%) grafts to the dorsal pedal artery for gangrene or ulcer (n = 69), rest pain (n = 54), or claudication (n = 3). Wound complications developed in 55 grafts (44%): erythema developed in 11, but they healed primarily, 19 had skin edge necrosis or localized lymph leaks, 12 had necrosis or infection into the subcutaneous tissue without danger to the graft, and invasive infections that threatened the graft developed in 13. Risk factors for a subsequent wound infection included the development of a lymph leak (p less than or equal to 0.05) and early postoperative graft revision for thrombosis, wound hematoma, retained valve or arteriovenous fistula (p less than or equal to 0.05). The mean time to appearance of a graft-threatening wound infection was 31 days, and 10 of 13 were located in the distal limb. Twelve of the 13 deep infections required operative debridement, and seven required a flap or split thickness skin graft for coverage. Gram-negative as well as gram-positive infections responded equally well. No grafts were lost, and no deaths occurred. Despite the high incidence of wound complications, an aggressive therapy regimen permitted universal graft salvage.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional echocardiography can detect regional wall motion abnormalities resulting from myocardial ischemia produced by dobutamine infusion. In 60 patients undergoing elective aortic surgery (27 with aneurysms, 33 with occlusive disease), we evaluated the ability of dobutamine stress echocardiography to predict perioperative cardiac events. Echo images were obtained at rest and during incremental dobutamine infusion to a peak dose of 50 micrograms/kg/min, unless another test end point was reached (angina, heart rate greater than or equal to 85% of age-predicted maximum, significant ST segment depression, or new stress-induced wall motion abnormalities). Dobutamine stress echocardiography results were stratified as follows: group I, no wall motion abnormalities; group II, resting wall motion abnormalities unchanged with stress; group III, stress-induced worsening of resting wall motion abnormalities; group IV, new-onset wall motion abnormalities with stress. Twelve cardiac events occurred within the first 30 postoperative days: three cardiac deaths (5%), six nonfatal myocardial infarctions (10%), two patients with unstable angina (3.3%), and one patient with asymptomatic elevation of creatine phosphokinase MB isoenzymes without electrocardiographic changes (1.7%). Eleven events occurred in the 38 patients with an abnormal dobutamine stress echocardiograph (groups II to IV); in contrast, only one of 22 patients with a normal dobutamine stress echocardiograph (group I) had a cardiac event. These event rates (29% vs 4.6%) differed significantly (p less than 0.025). Dobutamine stress echocardiography is a new, safe, rapid, relatively low cost, noninvasive, nonexercise cardiac stress test for risk stratification before major vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "The most accurate measurement of skin perfusion pressure is made with use of radioisotopic clearance techniques. We compared the skin perfusion pressure using radioisotope to the skin perfusion pressure measured simultaneously by placing laser Doppler and photoplethysmography probes within a transparent polyvinylchloride plastic blood pressure cuff in 13 subjects. A new device, which was created for this experiment, consisted of a plastic bladder into which light-emitting probes can be placed, so that the pressure applied to the skin was transmitted by the surface of the bladder, rather than by the surface of a rigid probe. The cuff was inflated to a supra-systolic pressure over the intradermal injection site of technetium Tc 99m, then deflated in 10 mm Hg decrements at 3-minute intervals. The pressures at which radioisotope clearance began, at which microcirculatory flow was detected by laser Doppler, and at which deflection of the photoplethysmography (DC mode) output occurred, were recorded as the skin perfusion pressure. The range of radioisotopic determined skin perfusion pressure was 0 to 100; skin perfusion pressure-laser Doppler was 0 to 100; and skin perfusion pressure-photoplethysmography was 60 to 100, with 7 of 13 limbs demonstrating no clear deflection point and thus an unobtainable skin perfusion pressure-photoplethysmography reading. Linear regression revealed a coefficient of correlation of 0.991 for skin perfusion pressure when the radioisotopic and laser Doppler methods were compared. Our study is not in agreement with previous reports of the successful determination of skin perfusion pressure with use of photoplethysmography. This may be due to differences in our technique when compared with previous reports of skin perfusion pressure-photoplethysmography determination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Forty-one axillopopliteal bypass grafts have been placed in 30 patients for limb salvage in the past 12 years. The mean patient age was 65.6 years; 8 were women; 19 smoked; and six had diabetes. Sixteen grafts were straight axillopopliteal bypass grafts, and 25 were sequential axillopopliteal bypass grafts. Cumulative life-table primary patency rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 70%, 56%, and 43%, respectively; secondary patency rates were 73%, 57%, and 50%, respectively. Corresponding limb salvage rates were 86%, 69%, and 69%, respectively. Ringed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft patency at 3 years was 61% versus 40% for unsupported PTFE grafts (p = 0.35). Ringed PTFE axillofemoral grafts with sequential femoropopliteal saphenous vein grafts had a 3-year patency of 67%. Graft patency was restored in 25% of occluded grafts by thrombectomy and in 80% of occluded grafts by thrombectomy with graft revision (p = 0.21). Cumulative 3-year patient survival was 48%. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 20%; patients operated on for graft infection had a 30-day operative mortality rate of 36%. The data support the use of axillopopliteal bypass for limb salvage when standard revascularization techniques are contraindicated. Long-term patency is enhanced by use of externally supported PTFE and sequential femoropopliteal saphenous vein.",

    "abstract": "An endothelial cell lining in a prosthetic vascular graft has been shown to decrease graft thrombogenicity. However, previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that grafts seeded with endothelial cells produced platelet-derived growth factor, a potent smooth muscle cell mitogen that may promote intimal hyperplasia. This study was undertaken to assess temporal changes in platelet-derived growth factor production by grafts seeded with endothelial cells and unseeded grafts and adjacent arteries. Adult beagles underwent placement of 20 to 22 cm long, 8 mm inner diameter, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene thoracoabdominal aortic grafts that were either seeded with autologous jugular vein endothelial cells or were unseeded controls. Grafts and adjacent arteries were removed at times up to 2 years after implantation. The tissue was studied in organ culture and platelet-derived growth factor production was measured after 72 hours with use of a radioreceptor assay. Platelet-derived growth factor production by endothelialized grafts increased significantly over the period studied, especially at the anastomoses, whereas that by arterial segments did not change significantly. The increase in platelet-derived growth factor production was greater in the distal than the proximal anastomotic segment suggesting a possible explanation for the clinical finding of more severe intimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomosis.",

    "abstract": "This report describes a computerized approach that allows the creation of realistic three-dimensional arterial images from two-dimensional contiguous slices derived from a conventional ultrasound scan. Furthermore, the study assesses the method's feasibility and accuracy by performing in vitro cadaver artery three-dimensional reconstructions. Images are digitized into a computer, with a resolution of 512 x 480 pixels, and a dynamic range of 8 bits/pixel (256 gray scale). After edge enhancement with convolution filters through the original binary data, the intraluminal and outer edges are traced and converted to a polygon vector within a defined three-dimensional space. Serial cuts, 2 mm apart, are then \"stacked\" into a three-dimensional model, with interpolation of polyhedra between slices. Sixteen normal and arteriosclerotic distal aortic and common iliac arteries were obtained from fresh cadavers. Three-dimensional reconstruction models were compared with gross examination of the original artery. Anatomically accurate reconstructions were obtained, all with detailed surface information. Data analyzed included diameter, area, residual lumen, and percent stenosis. Pearson's coefficients determined for the pairs of data indicated excellent correlation (greater than or equal to 0.90) between separate measurements. With use of the described technology it is feasible to perform arterial three-dimensional reconstructions on a personal computer, with detailed and accurate surface information. The three-dimensional reconstruction method used can reliably and consistently reproduce the anatomic specimens.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of combined methods of spinal cord protection during thoracoabdominal aortic reconstruction was evaluated because a recent clinical study failed to substantiate the value of cerebrospinal fluid drainage when used alone in the prevention of paraplegia. The effect of cerebrospinal fluid drainage and aortofemoral shunting were analyzed with regard to neurologic outcome and spinal cord blood flow in a model of thoracic aortic occlusion. In addition, we studied the use of motor-evoked potentials as compared with somatosensory-evoked potentials in monitoring cord perfusion. Thirty-two dogs underwent proximal and distal thoracic aortic occlusion for 60 minutes. The control group (n = 8) underwent thoracic aortic cross-clamping only. Spinal cord protection was used in three groups: cerebrospinal fluid drainage alone (n = 8), aortofemoral shunting alone (n = 8), and cerebrospinal fluid drainage and aortofemoral shunting (n = 8). Neurologic outcome improved in all treatment groups as compared with controls (p less than 0.001). The addition of cerebrospinal fluid drainage to aortofemoral shunting did not further improve neurologic outcome. Spinal cord blood flow measured with microspheres in the lumbar gray matter was significantly higher in the dogs with aortofemoral shunting (+/- cerebrospinal fluid drainage) as compared with those with cerebrospinal fluid drainage alone (p less than 0.05) or the controls (p less than 0.001). Aortofemoral shunting also prevented the development of acidosis and hyperglycemia. Loss or changes in amplitude and latency of motor-evoked potentials did not distinguish between the groups. Loss of somatosensory-evoked potentials had a high sensitivity (92%) but lower specificity (68%) in predicting neurologic injury, whereas loss of motor-evoked potentials had a high specificity (100%) but a very low sensitivity (16%). We conclude that cerebrospinal fluid drainage or aortofemoral shunting significantly improve spinal cord blood flow and neurologic outcome. The greatest increase in spinal cord blood flow was seen with aortofemoral shunting, which also prevented metabolic disturbances of reperfusion. Although the addition of cerebrospinal fluid drainage to aortofemoral shunting was the only group in which no neurologic injury occurred, this group did not have a significant improvement in outcome when compared with aortofemoral shunting alone. Spinal cord ischemia was more accurately detected with somatosensory-evoked potentials when aortofemoral shunting was used, whereas motor-evoked potentials recorded from the spinal cord were not sensitive enough to predict neurologic injury.",

    "abstract": "Between May 1966 and June 1991, 129 patients underwent surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, with an overall 30-day mortality rate of 35%. In 75 operations (58%) performed electively, 11 deaths (15%) occurred, and in 54 cases (42%) of either symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms 34 deaths (63%; p less than 0.001) occurred. No one survived among six patients with preoperative hypotension (less than 90 mm Hg) or cardiac arrest. In 16 patients (12%) the etiology of aneurysms was a result of chronic aortic dissection, and the mortality rate in this subgroup was 44%. In the remaining 113 patients (88%) where the etiology was atherosclerosis, 38 deaths occurred (34%; p = 0.433). Spinal cord ischemia occurred in 25 cases (21%) among 116 patients who survived operation. Partial ischemia occurred in six cases (25%), and complete paraplegia occurred in the remainder. Complete and partial paraplegia occurred in 16 of 42 cases (38%) when all of the thoracic aorta was replaced (Crawford groups I, II) and in 9 of 74 cases (12%) when only the abdominal or lower thoracic aorta was replaced (Crawford groups III, IV; p = 0.016). Other complications included myocardial infarction (14 cases, 11%), respiratory failure (46 cases, 36%), and renal failure (33 cases, 27%). The major prospect for improved early survival of patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms seems to be early detection and elective repair before the occurrence of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Over a 30-month period (May 1988 to November 1990) 143 acutely ischemic lower extremities (126 patients) were treated with an aggressive surgical approach that included ankle level tibial-peroneal artery thromboembolectomy. Twelve lower extremities in 10 patients that remained ischemic were further treated with adjuvant ankle level urokinase infusion. Sixteen ankle level arteries in 12 extremities were infused with an intraoperative bolus (1 to 2) of urokinase (50,000 to 100,000 units). Continuous postoperative urokinase (25,000 to 50,000 units per catheter per hour x 1 to 5 days) was infused through ankle level arteriotomies in 10 extremities (14 arteries) that did not improve with the initial intraoperative bolus. Concomitant bypass grafting was necessary in four extremities. With adequate inflow established, adjuvant ankle level urokinase salvaged all 12 extremities. The mean increase in ankle/brachial pressure index was 0.84. During continuous postoperative urokinase infusion, lower extremity bleeding requiring blood transfusion occurred in four patients (50%). No deaths occurred in the operative period. Although rhabdomyolysis occurred in 90% of patients, no patients had renal insufficiency. The addition of ankle level urokinase delivery increased the potential limb salvage from 90% of the entire 143 extremities treated during this period to an actual limb salvage of 98%. A mean follow up of 13 months (6 to 36 months) identified one late amputation. Despite the demanding postoperative management required in these patients and the frequent need for early reoperation, the limb salvage obtained justifies this aggressive adjuvant technique in the management of the acutely ischemic lower extremity.",

    "abstract": "When sufficient vein for a completely autogenous femorotibial artery bypass is not available, composite sequential grafting by using vein combined with polytetrafluoroethylene material is a surgical option. This study reviews what is currently the largest collection of these grafts and focuses on technical aspects and long-term patency characteristics. During a 7-year period 67 composite sequential bypasses were used to manage rest pain (38), ulcer (18), or gangrene (11) in 62 patients (mean age, 66 years). Fifty-two percent were men, and 51% had diabetes. This method was used as a primary reconstruction in 30, a second bypass in 16, and in 21 it was used after multiple other failed bypasses. Femoral to above-knee popliteal (44) and below-knee popliteal (23) 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were placed. Then extensions of greater saphenous (57) or lesser saphenous (10) vein were anastomosed to the anterior tibial (19), posterior tibial (26), or peroneal (22) arteries. Fifty-three percent were maintained on long-term warfarin (Coumadin) anticoagulation, and 33% were maintained on aspirin. No deaths occurred in the perioperative period. Bypass patency was ascertained by a Doppler pressure and waveform analysis, with mean follow-up of patency or to the time of graft failure of 33 months (1 to 91 months). Three-year patient survival was 72%. Cumulative life-table primary patency of 72% (1-year), 64% (2-year), and 48% (3-year) was calculated. Two grafts are functioning 7 years after placement. Limb salvage was 84% at 2 years and 70% at 4 years. At the time of failure, five grafts retained a patent venous bypass segment, which allowed prompt reconstruction of the proximal portion. In a comparison of grafts with early failure and those with long-term patency, the SVS/ISCVS runoff score, vein diameter, tibial artery diameter, and coagulation status were similar. However, patients with the popliteal anastomosis above the knee had 2-year patency of 72% compared with 46% for those with below-knee anastomoses. This technique, when possible, appears preferable to an all prosthetic tibial bypass.",

This retrospective study was done to define the risks and benefits of arterial reconstruction in a population of patients having popliteal-to-distal bypass procedures. Between 1986 and 1990, 32 surgical procedures were performed on 29 patients. The patient's ages ranged from 46 to 86 years, with a mean age of 68 years. Twenty-four of 29 (83%) were men and 19 of the 29 (66%) had diabetes. Most patients had multiple indications for surgical intervention, and these included rest pain (54%), nonhealing ulcers (64%), and gangrene (29%). Arterial bypass with use of the popliteal artery for the proximal anastomosis was performed with in situ saphenous vein (50%), reversed saphenous vein (41%), and orthograde autologous vein (9%). Distal anastomoses were to the posterior tibial artery in 11 bypasses (33%), the peroneal artery in 10 (30%), the anterior tibial artery in two (6%), and the dorsal pedal artery in 10 (30%). Two deaths occurred in the perioperative period for an operative mortality rate of 6.9%.

Twenty preoperative SPECT studies were asymmetric, revealing focal or diffuse decreased perfusion reserve, and 13 also demonstrated infarcts. Five patients had symmetric (normal) studies. After carotid endarterectomy, 22 cases had changed flow distribution patterns. Usually improvement of reactivity ipsilateral occurred to the area operated on. In four, contralateral improvement was also found. Three of the patients who had preoperative symmetrical scans had increased ipsilateral reactivity after surgery indicating previous global loss of reactivity. Acetazolamide SPECT scans demonstrate a decreased perfusion reserve in 20 patients with carotid artery stenosis, indicating reduced perfusion and poor collateral circulation. Postoperative studies confirm improvement by demonstrating recovery of vascular reactivity in 84% of the patients. Acetazolamide enhanced SPECT scans may be helpful in providing objective evidence for selection of patients for carotid endarterectomy, especially in those who have an 80% carotid artery stenosis, but are asymptomatic.",

    "abstract": "Duplex-derived velocity measurements were used to assess the hemodynamics of 64 femoropopliteal arterial sites in 59 patients after angiographically successful percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. With use of angiography as the gold standard, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty was judged to be successful if (1) evidence existed of a \"split\" caused by intimal dissection and splitting of atherosclerotic plaque; and (2) no significant diameter-reducing residual stenosis was observed at the percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty site. At 1 month, 55 limbs (86%) were hemodynamically and clinically improved by SVS/ISCVS clinical criteria for chronic limb ischemia. Of the 55 percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty sites, duplex scanning had identified 40 (63%) sites with a less than 50% diameter-reducing stenosis and 15 (27%) sites with a greater than 50% diameter-reducing stenosis within a week after percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. Independent review of the 55 angiograms taken after percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty identified 39 sites (71%) with a split and 16 sites (29%) without. By life-table analysis, a greater than 50% diameter-reducing stenosis predicted a worse clinical outcome (15% at 1 year) compared with the presence of a less than 50% diameter-reducing stenosis (84% at 1 year) (p less than 0.001; log rank test). The presence or absence of an angiographic split was not a predictive factor of percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty outcome (split, 61% at 1 year; no split, 62% at 1 year) (p = 0.832; log rank test). The detection of a functional residual stenosis by duplex scanning did not correlate with angiographic appearance, but was predictive of clinical failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Duplex scanning has recently been used to monitor the patency of infrainguinal vein grafts. Empirically derived criteria that have been used for identifying the failing graft have never accounted for the effect of vein graft diameter or varying outflow resistance, despite the fact that they are major determinants of flow. We prospectively examined the variation in graft peak systolic flow velocity with graft diameter and outflow level in a consecutive series of 68 patients with 72 normally functioning vein grafts returning for routine follow-up. Images were obtained of vein grafts with a duplex scanner throughout their lengths, and the distal peak systolic flow velocity and intraluminal diameters were recorded. There were 15 popliteal, 26 tibial, and 21 inframalleolar grafts. The mean ankle-brachial index of inframalleolar grafts was 1.01 +/- 0.04 and did not differ significantly from tibial (0.96 +/- 0.03) or popliteal (0.93 +/- 0.06) grafts (p = 0.32). Grafts to the three outflow levels differed significantly in diameter, with inframalleolar grafts measuring 3.95 +/- 0.17 mm, tibial grafts 4.78 +/- 0.21 mm, and popliteal grafts 5.65 +/- 0.38 mm (p = 0.0001). In a similar manner inframalleolar grafts had significantly lower peak systolic flow velocities (59.1 +/- 3.4 cm/sec) than tibial (77.2 +/- 5.6 cm/sec) or popliteal (71.0 +/- 7.6 cm/sec) grafts (p = 0.04). Inframalleolar grafts did not demonstrate a significant correlation (r = -0.21, p = 0.29) between peak systolic flow velocity and graft diameter. Conversely, both tibial (r = -0.49, p = 0.005) and popliteal (r = -0.73, p = 0.002) grafts demonstrated significant inverse correlations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The results of 56 vein bypasses to the dorsal pedal artery performed in 53 diabetic patients who were admitted with ischemic foot lesions complicated by infection were reviewed. All patients had one or more of the following: infected ulcers (73%), cellulitis (45%), osteomyelitis (29%), gangrene (20%), or abscess (2%). Organisms were cultured from 84% of patients (average 2.6, range 1 to 9 organisms per infection). Elevated temperature (greater than 37.7 degrees C) or leukocytosis (greater than 9.0 x 10(3)/ml) were seen in 13% and 50% of patients, respectively. All patients were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, local debridement, wound care, and bed rest. Operative debridement or open partial forefoot amputation were required to control sepsis in 11 patients (20%). Treatment of infection delayed revascularization by an average of 10.7 days. All patients underwent autogenous vein bypasses to the dorsal pedal artery. Two grafts failed within 30 days (3.6%), and one patient died (1.8%). Wound infections developed in seven patients (12.5). One wound infection resulted in graft disruption and patient death at 2 months. Average length of stay of the initial hospitalization was 29.8 days. Fifty-two patients were discharged with patent grafts and salvaged limbs; however, 31 subsequent foot procedures and 35 rehospitalizations were required to ultimately achieve foot healing. Actuarial graft patency and limb salvage were 92% and 98%, respectively at 36 months. Pedal bypass to the ischemic infected foot is efficacious and safe as long as infection is adequately controlled first. The complexity of these situations often requires multiple surgical procedures and extensive wound care, resulting in prolonged or multiple hospitalizations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy to predict perioperative and late cardiac events after peripheral vascular operations. A total of 262 patients had dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy before 87 infrainguinal reconstructions, 108 abdominal aortic aneurysm operations, and 67 aortobifemoral bypass grafts that were placed for occlusive disease. Follow-up extended to 5 years (mean, 31.1 months). Logistic regression analysis selected dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy redistribution as the best predictor of perioperative events. Fixed defects were not predictive. A Cox proportional hazards model for a variety of clinical risk factors and scan parameters identified fixed defects and a history of congestive heart failure as the strongest predictors of late cardiac events. The presence of greater than 1 or 2 fixed segments were the best predictors in patients with an abnormal scan; redistribution did not predict late events. The risk of combined perioperative or late cardiac events was 29% for infrainguinal, 19% for abdominal aortic aneurysm, and 7.5% for aortobifemoral operations. Life-table analysis showed that after a cluster of perioperative events that occurred primarily in patients with dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy redistribution, most of the late cardiac morbidity and deaths occurred in patients with fixed defects.",

All 146 patients undergoing asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm repair over a 5-year period (1986 to 1990) were retrospectively placed into one of the three following groups on the basis of a clinical evaluation. Group I: no history of myocardial infarction or angina, no congestive heart failure, and no ischemic changes on electrocardiogram (ECG). Group II: history of myocardial infarction or class I-II angina or ischemic changes on ECG. Group III: presence of congestive heart failure or class III-IV angina. Patients in group I had no further cardiac work-up; patients in group II with angina had left ventricular ejection fraction assessment by multiple gated acquisition (all greater than 37%) and were cleared for operation by a cardiologist; patients in group II without angina had no further cardiac work-up; patients in group III had coronary angiography and then coronary revascularization.

    "abstract": "Aortobifemoral bypass (AoFB) is the preferred method to provide lower extremity inflow. To determine whether axillofemoral bypass (AxFB) is an acceptable alternative for high-risk patients, we reviewed our results with these two operations. Between 1985 and 1990, 29 axillobifemoral and 5 axillounifemoral bypass procedures were performed preferentially because of severe associated medical illness in patients with severe aortoiliac occlusive disease. During the same interval, 107 patients received an AoFB for pure aortoiliac occlusive disease. Nearly all patients having AxFB and AoFB were heavy smokers, and the two groups had similar rates of hypertension and angina. However, other major risk factors were more frequently found in patients undergoing AxFB. Limb-threatening ischemia was more frequent and femoral artery occlusive disease was more severe in patients having AxFB. Anastomosis to the deep femoral arteries and concomitant infrainguinal bypass were more likely to be required in patients who had AxFB. Life-table patient survival at 3 years was 35% for AxFB versus 91% for AoFB (p less than 0.001). Primary patency at 3 years was 63% for AxFB versus 85% for AoFB (p = 0.032). Secondary patency was 74% for AxFB versus 94% for AoFB (p less than 0.001). However, all revised grafts in both groups were patent at 36 months, and only one revised AxFB graft was an ultimate failure. Limb salvage at 3 years was 76% for AxFB versus 97% for AoFB (p = 0.065). Nineteen of the 22 patients with AxFB who died during follow-up died with patent grafts. Hemodynamic performance of AxFB and AoFB were compared. Mean preoperative ankle-brachial index was higher in AoFB (0.50) than AxFB (0.38, p less than 0.001), but postoperative ankle-brachial index was much higher after AoFB (0.83) than AxFB (0.57, p less than 0.001). Even after adjustment for severity of outflow disease, postoperative ankle-brachial index was much better after AoFB than AxFB. Axillofemoral bypass was performed in older higher risk patients with more severe ischemia than those in the AoFB group. Hemodynamic performance was inferior and graft failure more common after AxFB. However, AxFB provided limb salvage in all but 2 of 22 patients who have died, and no survivor has had amputation because of graft failure. Axillofemoral bypass is an acceptable but hemodynamically inferior alternative to AoFB in properly selected high-risk patients with critical lower extremity ischemia who would likely not tolerate the more durable AoFB.",

    "abstract": "To determine if recent trends in evaluation and therapy have contributed to the successful surgical management of carotid body paragangliomas, we reviewed our experience over the past decade. Nineteen carotid body paragangliomas were identified in 17 patients. Eleven patients underwent complete, preoperative embolization of their afferent arteries with one complication. Calculated carotid body paragangliomas surface areas did not differ between the embolized 64.6 +/- 43.3 cm2 and nonembolized 63.0 +/- 57.9 cm2 lesions. Intraoperative blood loss was lower (p = 0.02) in the patients treated with embolization (372 +/- 213 ml) compared with their cohorts (609 +/- 564 ml). However, the operative times were equivalent 4.1 hours versus 4.5 hours in both groups. Intraoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring was used in 10 patients; in one patient the EEG indicated intraoperative thrombosis of the carotid artery, which was successfully treated by thrombectomy without complications. Two patients required carotid bifurcation resection and vascular reconstruction to remove the entire tumor; a late stroke manifested by contralateral hand weakness developed in one of these patients. The incidence of cranial nerve injury was low at 16%, with one transient ramus mandibularis paresis and two instances of vocal cord dysfunction. Two additional patients had a postoperative Horner's syndrome. We conclude that by diminishing intraoperative blood loss through complete and careful preoperative embolization and use of intraoperative EEG monitoring along with careful surgical technique, the complications associated with this challenging operation are facilitated and diminished.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative stroke after carotid endarterectomy has been well studied, although little information is available regarding later strokes. We determined the etiology of late stroke after carotid endarterectomy by examining the records of those patients in our carotid registry who had a stroke more than 30 days after surgery. Thirty-five (5.1%) of the 688 patients in our registry had a stroke more than 30 days after surgery (mean follow-up, 59.3 months; standard error, 1.8 months; range, 1 to 292 months). The cause of late stroke was established by input from consulting neurologists, CT scanning of the head, magnetic resonance imaging results, angiograms, noninvasive studies, and postmortem examinations. Eight of the 11 strokes of unknown origin were massive fatal events for which no further evaluation was undertaken. Restenosis or occlusion accounted for fewer strokes (3 of 20, 15%) in the 1- to 36-month postoperative interval than in the greater than 36-month interval (8 of 15, 53.7%) (p less than 0.02 by Fisher's Exact Test). These data support the hypothesis that the early pseudointimal hyperplastic lesion is less likely to result in stroke than is later recurrent stenosis, which is usually related to atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "A new 1.9 micron Raman-shifted neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for small vessel welding. Bursting pressures and stresses of sutured and laser-welded arteriotomies created in the rat femoral artery and aorta were measured. Sutured arteriotomies had a significantly higher burst stress than laser-welded arteriotomies. Although there were no significant differences in burst stress at the various laser powers tested, an optimal power was identified. The laser was also used to weld transected rat aortas. The average power delivered was 200 mW for 30 seconds per anastomosis. The average time for completing an anastomosis was 6 minutes compared with 18 minutes when sutures were used. In relation to proximal aortic diameter, there was a 7.9% decrease at the anastomosis immediately (n = 4), and a 6.6% and 4.9% increase occurred at 24 hours (n = 4) and 10 weeks (n = 5), respectively. Acute anastomotic compliance, and compliance at 24 hours and 10 weeks were decreased by 47.2%, 39.5%, and 47.8%, respectively, and were similar to sutured anastomoses. Histology showed little thermal denaturation of the aorta within 0.6 mm of the anastomosis, approximately 1 mm of medial cell death, and nearly normal elastic fiber alignment. One focal false aneurysm was noted at 10 weeks. Although the sutured and laser-welded anastomoses share similar compliance changes, the laser-welded anastomoses are more isodiametric. This preliminary experience with the 1.9 micron laser shows the distinct advantages of a handheld fiber, no requirement for cooling irrigation, speed, and no difference in compliance from sutured anastomoses.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of extracellular matrix proteins to precoat small-caliber vascular grafts before endothelial cell seeding has been shown to improve cell attachment, proliferation, and adherence, the effect of precoating on the thrombomodulatory properties of the seeded cells is unknown. The use of vascular prostheses lined with confluent endothelial cell monolayers expressing optimal thromboresistant properties may enhance patency rates. In this study human saphenous vein endothelial cells were seeded onto expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft material, both unmodified and precoated with fibronectin, type I collagen, or fibronectin and type I collagen (fibronectin/type I collagen). After 3 days of in vitro cultivation, endothelial cell production of prostacyclin, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor was evaluated under basal conditions and after stimulation with arachidonate or thrombin. Production of tissue plasminogen activator by endothelial cells cultured on fibronectin-ePTFE was significantly greater compared with production by endothelial cells grown on noncoated or fibronectin/type I collagen-ePTFE under basal conditions (p values less than 0.01 and less than 0.05, respectively) and in response to thrombin (p values less than 0.002 and less than 0.003, respectively). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 production was not detected in any of the four experimental groups. Endothelial cells cultured on fibronectin-ePTFE also synthesized significantly more prostacyclin than endothelial cells grown on type I collagen- or fibronectin/type I collagen-ePTFE, under basal conditions (p values less than 0.02 and less than 0.01, respectively) and in response to arachidonate (p values less than 0.03 and less than 0.002, respectively) and thrombin (p values less than 0.003 and less than 0.002, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We report 66 patients undergoing 69 operations for chronic renal artery occlusive diseases operated on at two institutions between January 1985 and June 1990. Etiology was atherosclerosis in 59 patients (90%); fibromuscular disease in four (6%), and three children with nonfibromuscular disease stenosis (4%). Atherosclerosis was local in 10 and generalized in 49 (83% of all patients). Fifty operations (72%) were for salvage of renal function. Average serum creatinine was 2.3 mg/dl and was elevated in 46 patients (70%). Donor arteries for reconstruction were aorta 20 (29%), aortic graft 16 (23%), and other abdominal arteries 33 (48%). Twenty-one patients had concomitant vascular procedures including 16 aortic replacements. The two operative deaths (3%) followed aortic replacements. Three grafts (4%) occluded before discharge from the hospital. Eighty-six percent of patients undergoing renal salvage avoided long-term dialysis. In past decades fibromuscular disease and localized atherosclerosis were the most frequent renal artery occlusive diseases undergoing surgery, hypertension was the predominant indication, and the most frequent operation was aortorenal bypass. As a result of improved pharmacologic management of hypertension and the development of percutaneous transluminal dilation, most patients in this series had far advanced generalized atherosclerosis, and renal salvage was the most frequent indication for operation. As a consequence of the severity of the atherosclerosis, 48% of operations avoided the aorta, 23% replaced the aorta, and aortorenal bypass was used in only 29%.",

    "abstract": "Platelet degranulation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of acute arterial thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia, and atherogenesis. Most previous studies that examined the effect of heparin on platelet function have used platelet aggregometry. These studies have resulted in contradictory data and, by the nature of the assay, reveal no information with regard to platelet degranulation. In contrast, flow cytometry allows accurate quantification of the extent of platelet degranulation by measurement of the platelet surface binding of a GMP-140 specific monoclonal antibody (S12). GMP-140 is only expressed on the platelet surface after platelet alpha granule release. In the present study increasing concentrations of heparin were added to whole blood anticoagulated with sodium citrate. Platelets were activated with a panel of agonists, and the extent of platelet degranulation was quantified by whole blood flow cytometry. Heparin concentrations as high as 100 units/ml were found to suppress platelet alpha granule release induced by either a thromboxane A2 analog (U46619) or a combination of adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine. Heparin suppressed alpha granule release induced by thrombin both in whole blood and in washed platelets. The addition of heparin after platelet activation had no effect on S12 binding. In summary, heparin in high concentrations is a potent inhibitor of platelet degranulation, an action that is unrelated to its effect on the coagulation cascade. Although the heparin concentrations used in this study exceed those used clinically by a factor of 10 or more, future studies of heparin fractions may allow the separation of the anticoagulant and antiplatelet properties of the molecule and allow the administration of an agent that selectively suppresses platelet degranulation without the humoral anticoagulant effect.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this cohort study was to assess the quality of life of patients with severe ischemia as a result of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease. Spitzer's QL-INDEX was selected to measure quality of life at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. On the basis of initial treatment, 61 patients were grouped as follows: IC (conservative, n = 31), IR (arterial reconstruction, n = 14), and IA (major amputation, n = 16). After 12 months of follow-up, 48 patients were similarly regrouped according to ultimate treatment as follows: UC (n = 19), UR (n = 9), and UA (n = 20). At 12 months the mean score was significantly higher than the baseline in IC (6.43 vs 3.84, p less than 0.0001) as well as IR (5.64 vs 3.57, p less than 0.01), but not in IA (4.43 vs 3.62). The QL-INDEX mean score was lower in UA than in UC (4.15 vs 6.58, p less than 0.01) or UR (4.15 vs 7.11, p less than 0.0001). The correlation between QL-INDEX and an arbitrary scale was also high (r = 0.726, p less than 0.001). In conclusion, quality of life of patients with limb ischemia can be confidently assessed, improves during the first year of follow-up if major amputation is avoided, and improves and is sustained by a functioning graft.",

    "abstract": "Protamine sulfate causes direct myocardial suppression when used to reverse heparin anticoagulation. Protamine's excessive positive charge accompanying its surface arginine groups appears to be responsible for this toxicity. This study was designed to assess the hypothesis that negatively charged heparin given after protamine exposure may enhance the recovery of protamine-induced myocardial dysfunction. Isolated rabbit hearts (n = 20) were perfused with physiologic saline solution at 80 to 90 mm Hg containing high dose protamine, 250 micrograms/ml, until heart contraction essentially ceased (baseline). Hearts were then randomly reperfused for 15 minutes with either physiologic saline solution (group I, n = 10) or heparin plus physiologic saline solution (group II, n = 10) at a dose of 0.1 IU/1.0 microgram of previously administered protamine. Developed left ventricular blood pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery PaO2, contractility (+dp/dt), oxygen extraction (AvO2), oxygen consumption (VO2), and rate x pressure product were assessed. A protective, beneficial response accompanied heparin administration (group II) in all functions assessed except blood pressure. Maximum changes, comparing group I with II, were heart rate (beats/min) -72 versus -1, p less than 0.001; +dp/dt -64% versus -51%, p less than 0.01; PaO2 +86% versus +9%, p less than 0.001; AvO2 -37% versus -4%, p less than 0.001; VO2 -50% versus -28%, p less than 0.008; and rate x pressure product -73% versus -51%, p less than 0.001. These data suggest a separation of protamine's hemodynamic effects (blood pressure) and metabolic effects (VO2). Furthermore, these data support the tenet that heparin is able to markedly lessen the toxic myocardial effects of protamine.",

    "abstract": "The role of medial calf perforators in the initiation or promotion of venous disease is incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to define the direction of blood flow in the perforating vein of the calf in normal limbs and in those limbs of patients with venous disease under defined laboratory conditions. Both lower limbs of 57 patients, (32 women and 25 men, median age, 56 years; range, 40 to 62 years) were examined by duplex ultrasonography. In 10 patients no clinical or duplex evidence existed of venous disease. In 60 legs we found evidence of superficial venous insufficiency, complicated by lipodermatosclerosis in 29. In 15 limbs we found deep venous insufficiency. Finally, in 19 limbs no evidence existed of venous disease, but venous reflux was present in the contralateral limb. The direction of blood flow in the medial calf perforators was assessed during compression of the foot and calf, by a cuff that inflated to 60 mm Hg. Blood flow was also assessed during deflation of the cuff. We found that the direction of blood flow within medial calf perforators can be both inward or outward, even in limbs without evidence of venous disease. Outward flow could be demonstrated in 21% of perforators in normal limbs. Flow on release of distal compression occurred in 33% to 44% of perforators in limbs with evidence of venous disease but in none of the perforators in limbs without evidence of venous disease. We found that flow, during the relaxation phase, within medial calf perforators was associated with venous disease elsewhere in the limb.",

    "abstract": "Aorta-common femoral artery bypass is the standard operation for relief of aortoiliac occlusive disease. When extensive superficial femoral artery disease coexists, the profunda femoris, even in its distal portion, may be used as the outflow vessel. To test this assumption we compared cumulative patency, limb salvage, and the need for distal bypass of 134 aorta-profunda femoris and 151 aorta-common femoral artery bypasses performed consecutively for aortoiliac occlusive disease over a 12-year period. We also analyzed results of proximal (n = 103) and distal (n = 31) aortoprofunda bypasses. Angiographic and noninvasive studies showed greater disease in limbs undergoing aorta-profunda femoris bypass. However, no difference was observed in cumulative patency (91% +/- 6% vs 96% +/- 3%) or limb salvage (90% +/- 6% vs 94% +/- 3%) at 5 years. Seventeen distal bypasses in the group undergoing profunda femoris bypass and 20 distal bypasses in the group undergoing common femoral artery bypass were required to maintain limb salvage. Proximal and distal aorta-profunda femoris bypasses showed no difference in cumulative patency (91% +/- 9% vs 95% +/- 6%) or limb salvage (94% in each group) at 3 years. Standard aorta-common femoral artery and aorta-profunda femoris bypass provide cumulative patency and limb salvage exceeding 90% at 5 years; concomitant or subsequent distal bypass was required in 12% or limbs undergoing aorta-profunda femoris bypasses. Both proximal and distal profunda femoris arteries provide a durable outflow tract when aortoiliac and femoropopliteal occlusive disease are combined.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a surgical emergency with a high mortality rate even when diagnosed and repaired immediately. We retrospectively reviewed 152 cases of ruptured abdominal aneurysms to identify the incidence of misdiagnosis leading to a delay in treatment, the most frequent misdiagnoses, and the outcome in this group of patients. Forty-six (30%) were initially misdiagnosed. The most common misdiagnoses were renal colic, diverticulitis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The most common initial physical findings in misdiagnosed patients were abdominal pain (70%), shock (57%), and back pain (50%). A pulsatile abdominal mass was found in only 26% of misdiagnosed patients versus 72% of patients correctly diagnosed (p less than 0.005). Misdiagnosed ruptured abdominal aneurysm had a 44% mortality rate, which was not significantly different from patients correctly diagnosed (58%, p = 0.34). The lack of difference in mortality rates is most likely due to preselection of those misdiagnosed patients who were able to withstand the delay in diagnosis and survive to surgical treatment. The 30% incidence of misdiagnosis in this series suggests that it is frequently a difficult diagnosis to make and must be considered in elderly patients, especially men, who are admitted with abdominal pain and/or back pain.",

    "abstract": "Congenital arteriovenous malformations confined to the soft tissues of the pelvis are rare and challenging lesions. Multitudinous embryonic macrocommunication and microcommunication between the arterial and venous systems, with resultant shunting of blood to the low-resistance veins, produce massive venous and tissue engorgement. No well-established guidelines exist concerning their management. Percutaneous arterial embolization and surgery are associated with high recurrence rates. Surgical excision is frequently not possible and can result in massive hemorrhage. Only 52 cases have been reported in the English-language literature, and only two patients were followed for longer than 6 years. This report presents two additional patients with massive pelvic arteriovenous malformations monitored for 9 and 17 years. One patient was initially treated with arterial percutaneous embolization and the other with attempted operative ablation. A review of the literature has allowed us to develop the following management guidelines: Asymptomatic, nonenlarging lesions require no intervention and can be safely followed by clinical and radiologic (ultrasonography, CT scanning) examinations every 6 months. Symptomatic or rapidly enlarging lesions should be treated with preoperative arterial embolization and surgical excision attempted only if the arteriovenous malformation is localized and does not involve adjacent organs. Arterial embolizations may be repeated to provide symptomatic relief of diffuse, large lesions that involve the bladder or bowel. This protocol will avoid unnecessary and frequently life-threatening surgery in the management of pelvic arteriovenous malformations.",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic assessment of aortoiliac occlusive disease is necessary for successful arterial reconstruction of the legs. Various methods have been proposed, and the \"pull through\" intraarterial pressure measurement method is accepted as the best standard. The pressure readings, however, seemed to depend on the intraluminal position of the catheter. To explain these observations and make a comparison between the Doppler method and the pull through method, we have studied centerline velocity changes at the stenosis throat by Doppler ultrasonography, and axial and lateral pressure gradients by use of pressure transducers mounted 10 mm and 40 mm downstream of short (4 mm) axisymmetric sharp-edged model stenoses having cross-sectional reduced areas of 64%, 84%, 91%, and 96%. Axial manometric pressures measured 10 mm beyond the throat of 84% stenosis were more than twice as high as the lateral pressures. No significant difference was observed between axial and lateral pressures measured 40 mm downstream from the throat. This pressure distribution has important clinical relevance. Mean and peak pressure gradients for both the Doppler method and manometric measurements were compared. Measurements with Doppler method and manometric measurements indicated that mean pressure gradients (r = 0.98; SEE = +/- 2.4 mm Hg) correlate better than peak pressure gradients (r = 0.90; SEE = +/- 16.5 mm Hg). Doppler gradients were higher than manometer gradients. Overestimation was 13% for mean pressure gradients and ranged from 10% to 150% for peak pressure gradients. Explanation for the difference between mean Doppler and catheter gradient may be the pressure recovery occurring in the relaminarized poststenotic regions.",

    "abstract": "Several recent reports have suggested that pressor hormones may be released during and after carotid endarterectomy and that release of these factors may be associated with postoperative hypertension and other postoperative morbidity. We measured vasopressin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol in jugular venous blood during carotid endarterectomy under general anesthesia in 43 patients with routine carotid shunting. Jugular venous vasopressin increased significantly after the second period of carotid occlusion for shunt removal and remained increased at closure. Vasopressin did not change during the initial carotid occlusion for shunt placement or during the endarterectomy itself, and neither ACTH nor cortisol changed at any sample time. Greater resting vasopressin and cortisol and larger responses of vasopressin were observed in patients receiving phenylephrine to correct intraoperative hypotension. There were no correlations between postoperative hypertension or postoperative complications and intraoperative hormone values. These results suggest (1) basal intraoperative vasopressin values reflect the blood volume of the patient, (2) increased vasopressin was not related to postoperative morbidity, and (3) intraoperative increases in pressor hormones are most likely physiologic responses to specific stimuli such as hypovolemia or hypotension rather than pathologic phenomena. We speculate that the increase of vasopressin after the second carotid occlusion and reperfusion of the brain may be due to the action of humoral factors released into the carotid circulation from the endarterectomy site.",

    "abstract": "No ideal prosthetic conduit exists for femoropopliteal reconstruction. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has gained much greater popularity than the less expensive Dacron, despite disappointing long-term patency for each material. Few direct comparisons of results with the two materials have been performed. The concurrent experience of a single surgeon with femoropopliteal reconstructions of PTFE (n = 85) or knitted, nonvelour Dacron (KNVD, n = 38) was reviewed. Risk factors were comparable in the two groups. Overall patency was significantly better for KNVD than for PTFE (p = 0.0096 by log rank; p = 0.039 by Cox proportional hazards; 48% vs 27% at 5 years). Since in this series the overall performance of KNVD was significantly better than PTFE, a reassessment of the prosthetic materials used in femoropopliteal reconstruction is necessary. These results justify a prospective comparison of PTFE and KNVD.",

    "abstract": "Reperfusion-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction may exacerbate skeletal muscle damage after an ischemic insult. Although concurrent endothelial and skeletal muscle injury has been documented after ischemia and reperfusion, their temporal relationship has not been well characterized. An isolated rat hindlimb model was used to measure the effect of progressive ischemia and reperfusion on both endothelial cell function and skeletal muscle damage. Endothelial cell dysfunction as reflected by changes in permeability was measured by protein clearance techniques with use of albumin labeled with iodine 125 (125I-albumin). Skeletal muscle damage was assessed by tissue uptake of technetium 99m pyrophosphate (99mTc-pyrophosphate). The soleus muscle was used for evaluation of endothelial and skeletal muscle damage throughout the study. Significant increases in vascular permeability preceded skeletal muscle damage. The protein leak index increased after 60 minutes of ischemia and reperfusion (7.5 +/- 1.2 vs 4.1 +/- 0.9 control), whereas the muscle injury index did not change until 120 minutes of ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion (10.5 +/- 0.6 vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 control). Significant graded increases in both indexes were noted with longer intervals of ischemia. Electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural evidence of endothelial and skeletal muscle damage after 120 minutes of ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion but not after 60 minutes of ischemia and reperfusion. These studies indicate that microvascular injury precedes skeletal muscle damage after ischemia and reperfusion. This temporal relationship may have important implications in designing strategies to minimize ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective study of transjugular intrahepatic shunts performed between June 1990 and June 1991 is reported. Twelve patients were actively bleeding at the time of the procedure; 12 other patients had had one to five bleeding episodes within the previous 2 weeks, and one patient had massive ascites from Budd-Chiari syndrome. Most patients had severe liver disease: 21 Child's class C, three Child's class B, and one Child's class A. Transjugular intrahepatic shunting was technically successful in all cases. Portal vein pressures were reduced on average from 36 +/- 7 cm H2O to 22 +/- 6 cm H2O. Variceal bleeding ceased after transjugular intrahepatic shunting in all patients who were actively bleeding. Five patients died (30-day mortality, 20%), and eight patients subsequently underwent elective liver transplantation. The transjugular intrahepatic shunts in the 12 other patients have remained patent an average of 5.5 months. Shunt occlusion occurred in three patients at 21, 24, and 102 days, respectively. All three occlusions were successfully reopened with percutaneous techniques, yielding a primary shunt patency of 88% and secondary shunt patency of 100%. Complications included new onset encephalopathy in one patient, which cleared with medical therapy and transient renal failure in one patient. These preliminary data suggest that transjugular intrahepatic shunting is a safe and effective therapy for the short-term treatment of patients with variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients with severe liver disease awaiting transplantation. The long-term benefit of transjugular intrahepatic shunting awaits further follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Chronic wounds such as venous stasis ulcers have become a socioeconomic problem. Even with successful initial management, the recurrence rate approaches 70%. With the advent of new wound healing agents, nonoperative attempts to heal these wounds appear indicated. This study reports a prospective randomized evaluator-blinded trial comparing two potential wound healing agents to an inert vehicle placebo. Eighty-six evaluable patients completed the trial. Silver sulfadiazine 1% in a cream proved to statistically reduce the ulcer size compared with a biologically active tripeptide copper complex 0.4% cream formulation or the placebo. There was no difference between the latter two treatments. Silver sulfadiazine has been shown to allow keratinocyte replication and to have antiinflammatory properties. In this trial its antibacterial action was not used since all ulcers had comparable bacterial levels (less than or equal to 10(5)/gm of tissue) before treatment. These results suggest that the silver sulfadiazine cream used in this study may facilitate healing in wounds healing largely by the process of epithelialization.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-two patients with intermittent claudication were prospectively enrolled in a 12-week program of supervised, graded treadmill exercise therapy. Severity and distribution of arterial occlusive disease were ascertained by noninvasive determination of segmental lower extremity blood pressures and waveforms. No attempt was made to modify risk factors for atherosclerotic occlusive disease. The exercise-induced reduction of the ankle pressure and its recovery were recorded over time, and the area under this curve, the \"ischemic window,\" represents the severity of the ischemic deficit. Absolute systolic ankle pressure, ankle-brachial index, maximum walking time, claudication pain time, and the ischemic window were measured before and after exercise training in all subjects. Maximum walking time and claudication pain time increased 659% and 846%, respectively, among the 19 patients completing the 12-week program (p = 0.001; p = 0.0002). These patients underwent a mean reduction of 58.7% in the ischemic window after a standardized workload (p less than 0.05), and this correlated with the degree of symptomatic improvement. Absolute ankle pressure and ankle-brachial index were unchanged after exercise training. This study confirms the utility of supervised exercise therapy in the treatment of intermittent claudication. The ischemic window is a useful method for quantifying the ischemic deficit produced by exercise and provides a reproducible means of documenting functional improvement in patients undergoing exercise training.",

    "abstract": "To minimize morbidity in carotid surgery we have adopted the practice of routine operative arteriography. In our total experience of 692 carotid artery reconstructions done since 1979 no arteriography was used for the first 157 procedures. The combined morbidity and mortality rate in this group was 4.5% (4 strokes and 3 deaths as a result of stroke). After 157 carotid operations we used intraoperative arteriography on all cases, and the neurologic morbidity and mortality rate for this part of the series was 1.3% (6 strokes and 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage). One death was due to myocardial infarction. The difference in ischemic neurologic sequellae between these two groups was statistically significant by chi-square analysis (p less than 0.01). Although the difference in these two cohorts could be related to the \"learning curve\" effect, it is unlikely that this is the only reason for the difference. Intraoperative arteriography has demonstrated unsuspected stenoses, occlusions, flaps, and kinks. There was also a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.01) in the number of reoperations for recurrent stenosis: 3.8% in the first group and 0.8% in the second group. No complications were thought to be directly associated with the arteriogram. Since the development of better digital imaging systems for the operating suite, this technique is much more easily used than when it was first described.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of prostaglandin I2 analogue (TRK-100) on the healing of arterial anastomoses. The infrarenal abdominal aorta was divided and reanastomosed immediately in rabbits. A control group of rabbits were fed commercial rabbit food (ORC 4); a cholesterol group of rabbits were fed a diet with 1% cholesterol added to ORC 4; and a TRK group of rabbits received the same diet as the cholesterol group, but TRK-100 was given subcutaneously at a dose of 0.3 mg (TRK-I group) or 1.0 mg (TRK-II group) every other day. After 3 months a blood sample was taken for biochemical analysis, and the abdominal aorta was harvested for histologic examination. The serum lipid and thromboxane B2 concentrations and the thromboxane B2/6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha ratio in the TRK groups were significantly lower than in the cholesterol group. The proliferative connective tissue did not cover the anastomotic suture line in either the control or the TRK groups. However, the suture line was covered completely by connective tissue in the cholesterol group. Intimal thickness in the cholesterol group was greater than in either the control or the TRK-II group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). These data suggest that TRK-100 may suppress intimal fibrous proliferation at anastomotic suture lines by a mechanism affecting the thromboxane B2/6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha ratio.",

    "abstract": "This is a prospective study of the relationship between graft preparation technique and the subsequent morphologic fate of vein grafts. Paired vein grafts (optimal vs injury prepared) were placed in a canine model and removed over time. Vein grafts intentionally injured by warm saline storage demonstrated endothelial and smooth muscle cell damage. In the acute postimplantation period, platelet adhesion and white cell infiltration of the graft were present. By 7 days, the endothelium had \"healed\", but the underlying smooth muscle cells had modulated and were of the transitional or synthetic phenotype. This persisted at 30 days, but by 60 days the graft wall had remodeled to a contractile smooth muscle cell phenotype. Changes in the extracellular matrix were greatest at 30 days corresponding to changes in the smooth muscle cell phenotype. None of these injurious responses were noted in optimally prepared, papaverine treated vein grafts. The combined intima and media (lumen to adventitial edge) was measured at baseline and at graft excision with use of digitized graphic techniques. The intimal/medial thickness of injured vein graft walls was always greater than that of pair-matched optimally treated vein grafts (p less than 0.01 analysis of variance). Optimal preparation of vein grafts is effective in minimizing endothelial and smooth muscle cell injury at the time of arterial reconstruction. This preservation of endothelial and smooth muscle cell integrity prevents subsequent morphologic changes associated with the \"arterialization response\".",

    "abstract": "Transcutaneous oximetry (tcPO2) performed during either oxygen inhalation or leg dependency was intra-individually compared in 64 patients suffering from a peripheral arterial occlusive disease, with and without critical limb ischemia. Among the 81 extremities investigated, 29 had a moderate peripheral arterial occlusive disease (6 in stage I, 23 in stage II) and 52 were initially affected by rest pain or ulceration (stage III/IV). Thirty-seven legs out of the latter improved under conservative treatment. In the remaining 15 limbs, vascular surgery or an amputation became necessary. The tcPO2 was measured at the forefoot with the patient in supine and sitting positions while breathing room air and in the supine position while inhaling 100% oxygen. In limbs with a tcPO2 below 15 mm Hg of patients in the supine position breathing room air, leg dependency generally provoked larger tcPO2 increases than oxygen inhalation. This difference between oxygen inhalation while supine and room air breathing leg dependency tcPO2 values exhibited an approximately linear correlation with the resting tcPO2. Responses of tcPO2 to leg dependency and oxygen inhalation seemed to reflect different mechanisms, that is, microvascular flow redistribution and supine perfusion reserve, respectively. The best discrimination of critical limb ischemia was observed for the tcPO2 of patients breathing room air while in the supine position, which was not surpassed by either the oxygen inhalation or the leg dependency test. Satisfactory results were achieved by combining limits for, first, supine (10 mm Hg) and sitting (45 mm Hg) tcPO2, as well as, second, ankle arterial pressure (60 mm Hg) and supine tcPO2 (10 mm Hg).",

    "abstract": "Two hundred fifty-eight patients underwent 322 infrainguinal revascularizations with use of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) between 1978 and 1988. The indication was limb salvage in 190 (59%) reconstructions. Two hundred nineteen (68%) were above-knee, and 75 (23%) were below-knee femoropopliteal bypasses. Twenty-eight (8.6%) were femoral-infrapopliteal bypasses, all done for limb salvage. Follow-up ranged from 24 to 144 months (mean, 66 months). The perioperative mortality rate (1 to 30 days) was 3.4% (9 patients), with no significant difference according to indication (2.9% vs 3.7%). Actuarial primary patency at 8 years for the entire series of femoropopliteal bypasses was 53% (above knee 53%; below knee 39%; p less than 0.05), and improved with additional procedures for a secondary patency of 72%. Femoropopliteal bypasses done for severe claudication had an 8-year actuarial primary patency of 63%, compared with 38% for limb salvage (p less than 0.02). Actuarial limb salvage in the latter group at 8 years was 66%. Femoral-infrapopliteal reconstructions with PTFE had a significantly lower primary patency at 3 years (22%, with a 37% limb salvage). Sixty-four percent of the failures for all reconstructions (N = 111) occurred within 12 months, with remarkable stabilization of patency curves beyond that interval. This experience represents the largest reported series of PTFE reconstruction with longest follow-up to date and may serve as a basis for comparison of other conduits. These results suggest an important role for PTFE in femoropopliteal revascularization and a limited role of this prosthetic conduit in femoral-infrapopliteal arterial reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "Extensive debates exist in the literature on the indications, effectiveness, and risks of carotid endarterectomy. However, no investigations analyze the procedure's epidemiology. Medicare paid for essentially all carotid endarterectomies on patients over 65 years old, more than two thirds of all such surgery. Accordingly, we identified all 1985 to 1989 Medicare bills for ICD-9-CM code 38.12. This report found an average annual decrease of 6.4% in the frequency of carotid endarterectomies. Higher proportions and incidence rates occurred among 65- to 79-year-old people, men, and whites. Larger, urban, and nonprofit hospitals performed the procedure more often. The number of hospitals performing this procedure has increased over time. Mortality rates within 30 days decreased from 3.0% of procedures in 1985 to 2.5% in 1989. Higher than average death rates occurred among older, male, and black patients, and in low volume hospitals. Clinical trials undertaken in large, urban, teaching, high-volume institutions reported only 1% deaths. The institutions actually performing carotid endarterectomies differ from the clinical trials in their demography and perioperative mortality rates. This difference in community practice may limit the applicability of the clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Although elastin depletion is thought to be an etiologic factor in abdominal aortic aneurysm, little is known about its transcription and posttranslational modification in normal and diseased human aorta. Our objectives were to quantify total elastin and elastin cross-links (desmosine/isodesmosine [DID]) and to determine if elastin mRNA was detectable in the disease-prone infrarenal aorta from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and a comparative group with no aneurysmal diseases. After preliminary extraction and thermolysin digestion, content of DID and the elastin tetrapeptide, valine-alanine-proline-glycine (VAPG), were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Tissue mRNA was studied by Northern blot analysis. Mean values (+/- SE) were compared by Student's t test. The proportion of insoluble elastin was markedly decreased in abdominal aortic aneurysm tissue (1.3% +/- 0.04% vs 12% +/- -2.8%; p less than 0.001). There was no difference in the small percentage of elastin solubilized during extraction in abdominal aortic aneurysm (5.3% +/- 1%) and no aneurysmal disease (6.0% +/- 1.2%; p = 0.71) tissues. The DID concentration of insoluble elastin was not different for abdominal aortic aneurysm and no aneurysmal disease tissue (0.18% +/- 0.07 vs 0.18 +/- 0.05 nm DID/nm VAPG; p = 0.97). On the basis of VAPG content, only 26% +/- 4% of the sodium hydroxide insoluble residue from abdominal aortic aneurysm was elastin; the predominate protein(s) was high in polar amino acids. Elastin mRNA was detectable in all tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In a previous study we have shown that perioperative monitoring for silent myocardial ischemia can noninvasively identify those patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery who are at significantly increased risk for perioperative myocardial infarction. In the present study a group of 385 patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery was studied long-term as well as short-term to determine whether perioperative monitoring for silent ischemia can identify those patients who are at significantly increased risk of late cardiac death or late cardiac complications as well as those patients at increased risk of perioperative myocardial infarction. All patients were monitored before, during, and after operation and were divided into two groups on the basis of results of monitoring: patients whose total duration of silent ischemia as a percentage of the total duration of perioperative monitoring was 1% or greater (group I, n = 120) and those for whom this value was less than 1% (group II, n = 265). Among patients in group I 13.3% (16 of 120) suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction in contrast to only 1.1% (3 of 265) patients in group II (p less than 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of preoperative and perioperative characteristics showed that the presence of a total perioperative percent time ischemic 1% or greater and age were the only significant predictors of perioperative myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the photoplethysmography findings in 152 patients admitted to the Middlesex Hospital Vascular Laboratory with suspected lower limb venous disease, and we compared the results obtained with patient grouping using clinical criteria and the presence of reflux on color duplex scanning. All photoplethysmography traces were normalized with use of computer software to enable direct comparison between the traces. The parameters investigated were the 95% and 50% refilling times and the initial gradient of the refilling curve. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine which parameter was the most useful predictor of disease and to identify which value within each observation gave the greatest sensitivity and specificity. We found a large overlap between interquartile values for all three parameters, with limbs grouped both clinically and by duplex scanning, making differentiation between normal and abnormal limbs difficult on the basis of photoplethysmography traces alone. We found that a 95% refilling time of less than 15 seconds indicated venous dysfunction with the greatest sensitivity and specificity and suggest that this value is most useful. Photoplethysmography readings are reproducible, noninvasive, and correlate well with the presence of clinical disease, and photoplethysmography remains useful in the assessment of venous dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Although changes in body temperature alter limb blood flow, little information exists on the effect of body heating and cooling on systolic pressures in limbs with arterial disease. Ten patients with stable claudication were studied. Mean ankle systolic pressure index during body cooling (0.79 +/- 0.04) exceeded (p less than 0.01) both the value during routine test (0.69 +/- 0.03) and during heating (0.65 +/- 0.04). The individual, paired difference in ankle systolic pressure index between cooling and heating exceeded 0.15 in seven limbs and between cooling and routine test in five. Mean toe systolic pressure index during heating, but not during cooling, was lower than during routine test (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in the mean toe systolic pressure index between heating and cooling. However, compared with heating, toe systolic pressure index increased with cooling in 12 limbs and decreased in eight, including three with loss of measurable pressure. The paired difference in toe systolic pressure index between cooling and heating exceeded 0.15 in 10 limbs and between cooling and routine test in eight; whereas between heating and routine test the paired difference was within 0.15 in all but three limbs. The results indicate that changes in body temperature have significant effects on distal pressures in arterial disease. Preliminary warming in routine tests should improve reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory cells often are seen in the walls of human aortic aneurysms, but their significance is uncertain. To investigate their actions an in vivo model of arterial aneurysms was developed in the rat. Fifteen units of hog pancreatic elastase were infused for 2 hours into the isolated abdominal aorta in 26 rats. The vessels were measured in vivo and were excised for conventional histologic and immunohistologic study at selected intervals. In untreated control rats the diameter of the aorta was 1.04 +/- 0.02 mm. Immediately after infusion with elastase the aorta dilated 26% to 1.31 +/- 0.02 mm (p = NS), with no histologically demonstrable remaining elastic lamellae. Two and one half days after infusion the aorta dilated nearly 300% to 3.09 +/- 0.08 mm (p less than 0.05). These vessels exhibited large numbers of activated macrophages and T cells in the media. Three and 4 days after infusion the vessels dilated 388% to 4.04 +/- 0.09 mm and 367% to 3.82 +/- 0.31 mm, respectively. These vessels also exhibited numerous inflammatory cells in the media. Six days after infusion the vessels enlarged 421% to 4.38 +/- 0.03 mm (p less than 0.05), and the infiltrate persisted staining immunohistologically for macrophages, polymorphic neutrophils, and T lymphocytes. Twelve days after infusion the aneurysms remained enlarged but stable at 4.23 +/- 0.14 mm (p = NS). At this time the number of inflammatory cells regressed to control levels. The temporal correlation between inflammatory infiltrate and aneurysmal enlargement suggests that inflammatory cells may participate in the destruction of the aneurysmal vessel wall thereby promoting progressive enlargement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The growth of endothelial cells from small segments of human great saphenous vein was investigated for possible functional studies of endothelial cell properties and endothelialization of cardiovascular prosthetic graft materials. Growth in medium containing fetal calf serum or human serum was compared, and the effects of adding compounds that increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, that is, cholera toxin and isobutylmethylxanthine, were also examined. It was shown that human serum was more efficient in stimulating cell growth than fetal calf serum at all concentrations tested. It was also shown that the addition of cholera toxin and isobutylmethylxanthine significantly potentiated growth. Minimal Essential Medium with the addition of 40% human serum and cholera toxin (1 nmol/L) and isobutylmethylxanthine (33 mumol/L) was shown to be optimal. From a single segment (3 to 5 cm), 20 x 10(6) human saphenous vein endothelial cells corresponding to 2000 cm2 or more could be achieved after 3 to 4 weeks in culture. The human saphenous vein endothelial cell cultures retained their cobblestone appearance, expression of von Willebrand Factor (vWF)-antigen, and capacity for prostacyclin production after six passages. We suggest that this provides a practically useful method for studies of cultured endothelium and possibly for pre-endothelialization of cardiovascular prosthetic materials.",

    "abstract": "Iloprost has been shown to minimize skeletal muscle necrosis when administered before the onset of ischemia in animal experiments, possibly by preventing neutrophil activation. Since patients with acute limb ischemia are seen after the process has begun, we investigated whether iloprost can be protective when given only during reperfusion. After anesthesia, 18 adult mongrel dogs underwent a standard isolated gracilis muscle preparation. In six control animals (group I) the gracilis muscle was subjected to 6 hours of ischemia followed by 48 hours of reperfusion. Group II animals (n = 6) received intravenous infusion of iloprost at a dose of 0.45 microgram/kg/hr beginning 1 hour before the onset of muscle ischemia and throughout the experiment (6 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion). In addition to the continuous infusion, they received 0.45 microgram/kg intravenous boluses of iloprost 10 minutes before the induction of ischemia and 10 minutes before reperfusion. Group III animals (n = 6) had a similar ischemic interval, but were given a bolus of iloprost of 0.45 microgram/kg at end ischemia followed by continuous infusion of 0.45 microgram/kg/hr for 48 hours during reperfusion. Muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 1 hour of reperfusion in all groups. Additional biopsies were obtained at 48 hours of reperfusion in groups I and III. Myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of neutrophil activation, was measured in all muscle biopsies. At the end of reperfusion, the gracilis muscle was harvested in all animals and weighed. Muscle necrosis was estimated by serial transection, nitroblue tetrazolium histochemical staining followed by computerized planimetry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of exogenous recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on angiogenesis in severely ischemic tissue beds. We used a two-stage procedure to produce severe ischemia of the hindlimb of 34 New Zealand rabbits. The ischemic hindlimb received intramuscular injection of saline (group A), 1 microgram bFGF (group B), or 3 micrograms bFGF (group C), daily for 2 weeks. Tissue perfusion, skeletal muscle infarction, angiogenesis, and collateral growth were assessed by angiography, transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2), quantitative spectrophotometric assay of triphenyltetrazolium chloride reduction in muscle, capillary density (capillaries per square millimeter), and capillary per muscle fiber ratio. There were no significant differences in baseline TcPO2 among the three groups for both thigh and calf measurements. Angiography revealed extensive perfusion of the left hindlimb in all the assessed bFGF treated animals. Both thigh and calf TcPO2 values showed a significant increase in all groups over the 14 days ischemia was induced (p less than 0.0001), but the two treatment groups exhibited a much more rapid rise in TcPO2 than the control group (p less than 0.0001). The capillaries per square millimeter and capillaries per muscle fiber ratios were significantly increased in all posttreatment measurements for all animals that received bFGF. The treatment groups with bFGF had a significant (p = 0.025) increase in thigh muscle viability compared with controls based on triphenyltetrazolium chloride reduction. Whereas there was evidence of muscle infarction in both the thighs of groups A and B, there was none in group C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To search for possible evidence of a relationship between human cytomegalovirus and aortic diseases, we examined 41 aortic lesions excised at surgery and 16 aortic tissues obtained at autopsy for the presence of cytomegalovirus DNA, by use of polymerase chain reaction. Cytomegalovirus DNA was present in seven (88%) of eight lesions of inflammatory aortic diseases with periaortic fibrosis, five of six inflammatory aneurysms, and all of two aortic occlusive lesions with inflammation. Cytomegalovirus DNA was detected in 20 (61%) of 33 atherosclerotic aneurysms, whereas it was detected in only five (31%) of 16 autopsy samples that showed neither inflammation nor atherosclerosis. Thus the possibility that cytomegalovirus may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory aortic diseases warrants further attention.",

    "abstract": "To determine the influence of unilateral internal carotid arterial occlusion (ICO) on Doppler frequency spectral analysis (DFSA) of the patent contralateral carotid artery, a retrospective review of 154 patients between July 1987 and December 1991 with angiographically confirmed ICO was performed, correlating duplex and arteriographic findings in a blinded fashion. Biplane arteriograms and bilateral carotid artery duplex studies that used a 5.0 MHz Doppler probe with a 1.5 mm3 sample volume at a 60 degree angle of insonation were performed on all patients. Each carotid artery was categorized by the severity of stenosis as quantified by arteriography: 1% to 15% (n = 41); 16% to 49% (n = 48), 50% to 79% (n = 21), 80% to 99% (n = 34), and bilateral occlusion (n = 10). DFSA peak systolic frequencies were commonly exaggerated in the presence of contralateral ICO and use of standard criteria for DFSA interpretation overestimated bifurcation stenoses in 43 of 89 lesions (48.3%) when determining nonhemodynamically significant lesions (less than 50% diameter reduction) with a sensitivity of only 57.3% and specificity of 96.9%. Conversely, prediction of hemodynamically significant lesions (greater than 50% diameter reduction) with standard criteria had 96.9% sensitivity but only 57.3% specificity. Modification of these criteria to account for the velocity increase or \"jet effect\" in the ipsilateral carotid artery system increased the sensitivity and specificity to 97.8% in predicting nonhemodynamically and hemodynamically significant stenoses respectively. A Doppler frequency spectrum with a peak systolic frequency (PSF) greater than 4.0 kHz and end-diastolic frequency (EDF) less than 5 kHz with an \"open window\" distinguished lesions with less than 50% diameter reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The ideal operative approach for infrainguinal in situ bypass grafting would render the saphenous vein (SV) valves incompetent while occluding venous tributaries from within the SV: an endovascular in situ SV bypass. Forty-six femoropopliteal-tibial in situ bypasses were performed in part by the endovascular occlusion technique. Valvulotomy was accomplished with a retrograde \"cutter\" valvulotome, and endoluminal cannulation of 84 SV tributaries was performed with a shape memory metal alloy (nickle-titanium), electronically steerable catheter under angioscopic surveillance. Sixty-nine SV tributaries (82%) were totally occluded and 15 (18%) were partially occluded with platinum occlusion coils. Twelve coils that \"recoiled\" into the SV lumen were retrieved uneventfully. The valvulotomes caused six SV perforations that were repaired without consequence. Intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed coil placement and verified venous tributary occlusion, as well as SV graft patency. During short-term follow-up (mean 9.2 months; range 1 to 15 months), all patients have undergone ultrasonography of the in situ bypasses. All 69 of the SV tributaries that occluded initially have remained occluded and 84% (39/46) of the in situ bypasses have remained patent. This study demonstrates that an electronically steerable nitinol catheter can be used safely to occlude venous tributaries from within the SV. Endovascular occlusion of SV tributaries may ultimately obviate the need for long incisions the length of the leg, thus reducing wound-related problems and shortening recuperation.",

    "abstract": "In patients with superficial femoral artery obstruction, iliac disease may be difficult to diagnose by commonly used noninvasive techniques. We studied common femoral artery acceleration time (onset of systole to peak systole), as measured from a Doppler spectral display and expressed in milliseconds. Previous work has suggested that an acceleration time of 144 msec or greater is abnormal and is associated with iliac stenosis (greater than or equal to 75% diameter reduction) or occlusion. During a 2-year period, in 139 limbs with superficial femoral artery obstruction, acceleration times were measured immediately before angiography. The overall test accuracy was 94.2% (131/139). In the 112 sides with normal angiograms, the acceleration time correctly identified no disease in 109 patients (97.3% specificity), and in the 27 iliac stenoses or occlusions the test detected disease in 22 patients (81.5% sensitivity). This appears to be a good test that can be done with equipment usually available in most vascular laboratories.",

    "abstract": "The case records of all infants under the age of 6 months who underwent surgery for acute arterial thrombosis between January 1980 and September 1991 were reviewed. Seven infants (nine ischemic limbs) were identified and ranged in age from 5 days to 5 1/2 months (mean 2.4 months); all weighed less than 5 kg (mean 3.9 kg). The cause in each case was iatrogenic. Diagnosis was based on the presence of a cool, mottled extremity associated with the absence of insonated peripheral arterial Doppler signals. Treatment included aortoiliac thrombectomy (n = 2), femoral artery thrombectomy with primary closure (n = 4), femoral artery thrombectomy with autogenous saphenous vein patch (n = 1), and axillary artery thrombectomy with end-to-end anastomosis (n = 1). Palpable pulses were restored in five (56%) of nine limbs and Doppler signals in the remaining limbs. There were no instances of limb loss. Excluding aortoiliac thrombectomy, palpable peripheral pulses were reestablished in only 40% of extremities. Thrombectomy is a safe and simple procedure in even the very youngest of patients with arterial insufficiency, but surgical optimism should be tempered by frequent inability to achieve full and durable success.",

    "abstract": "To further examine the use of arm vein for bypass to the popliteal or infrapopliteal arteries, we retrospectively reviewed 43 patients undergoing infrageniculate arterial bypass by use of an arm vein as a conduit. Nine grafts were done to the below-knee popliteal artery and 34 to the infrapopliteal arteries. Six grafts were done by use of a single segment of an arm vein, whereas 37 grafts were composites of either multiple segments of arm vein (n = 19) or segments of saphenous and arm vein (n = 18). Mean follow-up time was 15 1/2 months. Initial (30-day) graft patency and limb salvage were 95%. Primary graft patency by life-table analysis was 67% at 1 year and 49% at 3 years. Follow-up examination detected graft stenosis before occlusion in six patients (all of whom were given anticoagulant medication) and three failing grafts were salvaged. This increased overall 3-year secondary graft patency to 64% and 3-year secondary patency for infrapopliteal bypasses to 66%. Eleven of 12 graft occlusions resulted in major amputations (eight were above the knee, and three were below the knee) so that limb salvage paralleled secondary graft patency (63% at 3 years). Thus arm veins provide an excellent alternative venous conduit for infrageniculate arterial bypass, even when composite venous grafts must be used.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of anticoagulation on the incidence of thrombotic propagation and pulmonary embolism in patients with calf vein thrombosis after total hip or total knee arthroplasty. Patients undergoing arthroplasties had prospective surveillance for postoperative deep vein thrombosis by both bilateral contrast venography and venous duplex scanning. Calf vein thrombosis was documented by venography in 42 patients (50 limbs), including 29 of 253 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (11.4%) and 13 of 99 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (13%). Of patients on whom follow-up duplex scans were performed, heparin followed by warfarin anticoagulation was used in 11 (13 limbs) and withheld in 21 (25 limbs). Propagation of thrombosis to the popliteal or superficial femoral vein or both was detected by serial duplex scanning in 3 of 13 treated limbs (23%) and 2 of 25 untreated limbs (8%), (p = 0.43). All thrombus propagations were detected within 2 weeks of the operative procedure. There were no pulmonary emboli or deaths. Propagation of asymptomatic calf vein thrombosis after arthroplasty was not influenced by anticoagulation, suggesting that postoperative calf vein thrombosis need not be routinely treated. Serial venous duplex scanning is useful to identify the occasional patient in whom thrombotic propagation requiring anticoagulation develops.",

    "abstract": "Results of 21 external carotid endarterectomies (ECEAs) in 19 patients with symptoms were reviewed retrospectively. No patients died or had new strokes referable to ECEA within 30 days of surgery. Overall, six (32%) patients died during an average 41 months of follow-up (range 1 to 134 months). Persistent symptoms followed five (71%) of seven ECEAs performed for cerebrovascular insufficiency or transient ischemic attacks. One patient treated urgently for an evolving stroke failed to improve and died after hospital discharge. Another patient with crescendo transient ischemic attacks had a preoperative deficit that did not resolve for 6 months and had a second stroke 2 years later. Another patient had a stroke after a contralateral carotid reconstruction but recovered. In contrast, only two (14%) of 14 ECEAs performed for monocular amaurosis fugax had persistent symptoms after surgery. Durability of 16 ECEAs was evaluated by arteriography or duplex scanning. Of six ECEAs closed primarily, three (50%) occluded, one has 60% restenosis, and only two (33%) had no restenosis (mean follow-up 36 months). Of 10 ECEAs closed by patch angioplasty, none occluded, 2 had 20% restenosis, and eight (80%) had no restenosis (mean follow-up 47 months). Life-table analysis indicated improvement in ECEA patency and durability with patch angioplasty (p = 0.011). From these data, ECEA can be performed with relative safety but is more effective for treatment of monocular amaurosis fugax in patients with a microembolic source at the external carotid origin. Patients with any other indications for ECEA did not benefit consistently from this operation.",

    "abstract": "The clinical presentation of patients with elbow dislocations was reviewed to identify those factors indicating an increased risk for arterial injury. Sixty-two patients were treated for 63 elbow dislocations between January 1981 and July 1991. Eight patients (13%) sustained a concomitant arterial injury involving the brachial (7) and radial (1) arteries. Three clinical findings, absence of a radial pulse, open dislocation, and presence of systemic injuries, were correlated with arterial injury. A palpable radial pulse was absent in six (75%) patients with an arterial injury but in only two (4%) with normal vessels (p less than 0.0001, chi square). Five (33%) open dislocations had an associated arterial injury, whereas three (6%) arterial injuries occurred in closed dislocations (p less than 0.006, chi square). Systemic injury occurred in five dislocations (63%) with arterial injuries and 14 dislocations (25%) without arterial injury (p less than 0.04, chi square). Multivariate analysis showed that absence of a radial pulse was the only factor that significantly predicted arterial injury (p less than 0.0001). Although most elbow dislocations are not associated with arterial injury, absence of a radial pulse or presence of an open dislocation or both should alert the clinician to the increased possibility of an associated vascular injury.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation and management of potential arterial injuries in penetrating neck trauma are controversial. Routine surgical exploration or arteriography can be very expensive and time-consuming and can overburden available resources if used in all patients. We reviewed the records of 4035 patients seen in our trauma center during a 20-month period and identified a total of 110 patients (2.7%) with penetrating wounds to zone II of the neck; 50 were from gunshot wounds, 43 from stab wounds, 7 from shotgun injuries, and 10 from lacerations. In 42 (39%) patients there was no arteriogram or surgery based on location of the wounds or lack of any physical findings. None of these patients later had any evidence of an arterial injury. Forty-five patients (40%) had arteriograms based on proximity or a \"soft\" sign of vascular injury, which included evidence of significant bleeding or a stable hematoma. A total of 15 injuries to major arteries were identified: 3 common carotid, 5 internal carotid, and 7 vertebral. One patient died during initial resuscitation, and four patients went directly to surgery with no preoperative arteriogram for active bleeding and expanding hematoma (n = 1), an expanding hematoma (n = 2), and a large, stable hematoma (n = 1). Only one patient (of the 110) had a significant major arterial injury requiring surgery that was not predicted by physical findings. Nine arterial injuries were treated nonoperatively: six vertebral, two common carotid intimal flaps, and one small distal internal carotid pseudoaneurysm (diagnosed late). Three additional minor external carotid artery injuries were observed with no adverse sequelae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon but catastrophic event after cardiopulmonary bypass. From 1980 to 1990, 16,951 cardiac procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass were performed at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Ga. Eighteen patients (0.1%) had acute mesenteric ischemia that resulted in intestinal infarction. Emergency cardiac surgery had been performed in 16 of the 18 patients, and all 18 patients were vasopressor dependent for hemodynamic support after surgery. Diagnostic difficulties resulted in the diagnosis of intestinal infarction an average of 9 1/2 days after cardiopulmonary bypass. Nonocclusive mesenteric arterial ischemia was the determined cause in all cases. Statistically significant risk factors associated with acute mesenteric ischemia after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery included (1) emergency cardiac surgery (p less than 0.0001), (2) the use of an intraaortic balloon pump (p less than 0.0001), (3) failed angioplasty requiring emergency surgery (p = 0.0074), (4) prolonged pump time (p = 0.0093), and (5) advanced age (p = 0.0016). A high index of suspicion for mesenteric ischemia after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with identified risk factors may decrease the diagnostic delay and lead to an improvement in the 67% mortality rate seen in this series.",

    "abstract": "Two hundred seventy-one of 1509 patients who underwent thoracoabdominal aortic repairs had either celiac or superior mesenteric or renal artery occlusive disease. These latter patients were treated by endarterectomy or bypass between June 20, 1960 and Jan. 10, 1991. After 1987, the 30-day survival rate was 93% (79 of 85) compared with 90% (245 of 271) before 1988. Multivariate predictors of death were age, postoperative reoperation for bleeding, and cardiac complications (p less than 0.05). Renal complications (13% dialysis, 35 of 271) were associated with preoperative renal dysfunction, elevated preoperative serum creatinine level, urine clearance time of dye, extent of the aorta replaced, coagulopathy, and paraplegia or paraparesis (p less than 0.05). The incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction was reduced by renal artery endarterectomy (p less than 0.05). On univariate analysis the risk of renal failure was reduced by renal artery perfusion with cold Ringer's lactate solution (p less than 0.05). Gastrointestinal complications (9%, 25 of 271) were associated with a history of peptic ulcer disease on multivariate analysis (p less than 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival rates for patients with and without occlusive disease were 53% and 60%, respectively, and at 10 years 37% and 30%, respectively (p = 0.08). We conclude that endarterectomy or bypass of occlusive visceral disease reduces the risk of renal failure after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, does not decrease early or late survival, and does not increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.",

    "abstract": "Marked changes occur in cardiac function during aortic reconstruction. Numerous factors (primarily compliance changes) limit the currently used pressure-based pulmonary artery catheters' ability to reflect these changes accurately. A new pulmonary artery catheter was used in 26 patients undergoing aortic reconstruction (7 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms and 19 with occlusive disease) that directly measures right ventricular (RV) volumes and ejection fractions. The extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) was evaluated before surgery, and the patients were divided into three classes. The greatest changes in cardiac function were noted immediately after aortic cross-clamping. Cardiac output significantly decreased in patients with mild or moderate CAD (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001) but not in patients with no CAD (p less than 0.5). This correlated well with RV end-diastolic volume (RV-EDV) and stroke volume (RV-SV) measurements in the groups with mild (p less than 0.05) and moderate CAD (p less than 0.01) but not in the group with no CAD (p greater than 0.5). Wedge pressure showed poor correlation, with no significant change noted in any group (p greater than 0.5). Measurements taken later in the procedure documented a significant trend toward baseline in mild and moderate groups. At the opening of the second limb of the graft, the compensated values (CO, RV-EDV, and RV-SV) did not change significantly in the groups with mild and no CAD (p greater than 0.2) but approached significance in the group with moderate CAD (p less than 0.08).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The traditional approach to recurrent carotid stenosis has been repeat endarterectomy or patch angioplasty. Concern with the durability of repeat carotid endarterectomy has resulted in our use of carotid resection with autogenous graft interposition. This study was designed to determine the outcome and efficacy of carotid resection compared with repeat carotid endarterectomy in the management of recurrent carotid stenosis. From 1974 to 1991, 162 operations (repeat carotid endarterectomy 105, carotid resection 57) were performed for recurrent carotid stenosis. Indication for operation was hemispheric symptoms in 63% of patients, nonlateralizing symptoms in 25%, asymptomatic stenosis in 7%, and previous stroke in 5%. Ninety-one percent of patients had stenosis greater than 90% on arteriography. The perioperative stroke rate for carotid resection was 3.5%, with a subsequent rate of 0.0064 strokes per year. For repeat carotid endarterectomy, the perioperative stroke rate was 1.9% with a subsequent rate of 0.011 strokes per year. Graft patency after carotid resection was 93% (mean follow-up, 35 months). Four patients treated with carotid resection had graft thrombosis, and two of the four remained asymptomatic. After repeat carotid endarterectomy, one patient had carotid thrombosis, and recurrent stenosis greater than 50% developed in 23 patients (mean follow-up, 64 months). Twenty patients treated with repeat carotid endarterectomy underwent an additional operation for further symptomatic recurrent carotid stenosis. We conclude carotid resection is a safe and effective alternative to repeat carotid endarterectomy for patients undergoing operation for recurrent carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Management of infected prosthetic arterial grafts has traditionally included total graft excision especially when gram-negative bacteria were cultured. Between 1973 and 1991 we treated 42 patients with infected prosthetic grafts (33 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 9 Dacron) by complete graft preservation when the graft was patent, the anastomoses were intact, and the patient did not have sepsis. The infection involved the anastomosis (36 cases) or the body (6 cases) of 33 peripheral grafts and the distal segment of five aortofemoral and four iliac-distal grafts. Cultures of the 42 infected grafts grew gram-positive bacteria in 33 cases and gram-negative bacteria in 22 cases. Treatment adjuncts included repeated, radical operative wound debridement and rarely (7 of 42) rotational muscle flaps. This management resulted in a 10% (4 of 42) hospital mortality rate and an amputation rate in survivors of 3% (1 of 38 threatened limbs). All four deaths were due to sepsis: gram-positive bacteria were cultured in all cases and gram-negative bacteria in two cases. Of the 38 survivors, 29 (76%) wounds healed and remained healed after average follow-up of 3 years (range, 1 to 18 years). Nine other patients required total graft excision for nonhealing wounds (7 cases) or delayed anastomotic hemorrhage (2 cases). Gram-negative bacteria were cultured in four, and gram-positive bacteria were cultured in six of these nine wounds.

    "abstract": "The clinical presentation, resuscitation, and operative management of 129 patients with penetrating injuries to the abdominal aorta treated between 1960 and 1989 were reviewed. This is the largest reported civilian or military experience with this specific injury; our review of the literature was limited to reports focusing on the detailed analysis of the management and outcome of aortic trauma. Eighty-two percent of patients were in shock; 18 patients (14%) underwent emergency room thoracotomies, with no survivors. Of 46 patients requiring operating room thoracotomies, only 20% survived. All patients underwent exploration. Thirty percent had three or more visceral injuries; only 2% had no concurrent visceral injury. There were associated vascular injuries in 58% of patients, the inferior vena cava being the most frequent (37%). The most significant predictor of death was continued bleeding at operation. Ninety percent of patients with free intraperitoneal bleeding died, in contrast to 35% with a contained retroperitoneal hematoma (p less than 0.001). Aortic injuries were supraceliac in 25% of patients, between the celiac and renal arteries in 25%, and infrarenal in 50%. The respective mortality rates were 70%, 80%, and 47% (p less than 0.05). Repair of the aortic defect was possible in 103 patients (80%). The most common repair was lateral arteriorrhaphy in 53% of patients, followed by end-to-end anastomosis in 15% and prosthetic repairs in 8%. The overall mortality rate was 62%, which is similar to that of previous reports. Despite advances in trauma care, a functioning paramedic system, and the use of aggressive means to obtain aortic control, penetrating aortic trauma remains highly lethal.",

    "abstract": "To examine the treatment methods and early results of renovascular repair in our contemporary patient population, we reviewed our surgical experience during a recent 54-month period. From January 1987 to July 1991, 200 patients ranging in age from 5 to 80 years (mean, 56 years) were operated on for correction of nonatherosclerotic (43 patients) and atherosclerotic (157 patients) renovascular disease. The group included 92 men and 108 women, with blood pressures ranging from 300/198 mm Hg to 120/70 mm Hg (mean, 205/113 mm Hg). Defined by preoperative serum creatinine, 129 patients (65%) had evidence of renal insufficiency (Cr greater than or equal to 1.3 mg/dl), whereas 71 patients (36%) had severe renal insufficiency (Cr greater than 2.0 mg/dl; 11 patients were dependent on dialysis). One hundred forty-seven patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease (94%) demonstrated organ-specific atherosclerotic damage. Operative management of 291 kidneys included unilateral renal artery repair in 117 patients (58%), bilateral repair in 78 patients (39%), and primary nephrectomy in five patients (2.5%). Simultaneous aortic reconstruction was required in 64 patients (32%). There were five operative deaths (2.5% mortality rate) and four occluded renovascular repairs (1.4% primary failure) within 30 days of surgery. Hypertension was considered cured in 21% and improved in 70% of 195 operative survivors. In 70 patients with severe renal insufficiency before operation, estimated glomerular filtration rate was improved in 49% (8 of 11 patients removed from dialysis), unchanged in 36%, and worsened in 15%. Renal function response was significantly influenced by the site of disease and the operation. Twenty-six additional postoperative deaths occurred during follow-up (range, 6 to 58 months; mean, 24.4 months). Extreme atherosclerotic-renovascular disease, preoperative renal insufficiency, failure to improve renal function, and progression to dependence on dialysis after operation were associated with follow-up deaths. Although most patients had a beneficial outcome, failure to improve extreme renal insufficiency was associated with a rapid rate of death during a relatively short follow-up period.",

    "abstract": "An uncommon complication of percutaneous insertion of the titanium Greenfield filter is angulation at discharge with clustering of the limbs to one side of the vena cava. Potential adverse effects of this asymmetry were tested in a perfusion system with cadaver venae cavae. The stainless-steel Greenfield filter (SGF) was compared with the modified-hook titanium model (TGF-MH) and a percutaneous modified-hook model of the SGF (SGF-MH) with flexible plastic emboli in four sizes and varied sequences. There were 458 runs comprised of 2203 embolic events, with an overall successful capture rate of 81% despite tilting, asymmetry, and accelerated flow rates from 1.0 to 2.5 L/min. Significant differences were observed in vena cava with diameters greater than 22 mm where capture rate was 76% as opposed to 86% in venae cavae less than 22 mm (p = 0.01). Larger emboli (8 x 25 mm and 8 x 100 mm) were trapped uniformly, whereas smaller emboli (5 x 10 mm) had 59% capture (p = 0.001). Similarly, the capture rate was less when smaller emboli were released before the larger ones (71% vs 87%; p = 0.001). Capture in small versus large venae cavae was not significantly different for the SGF (75%) or TGF-MH (84% vs 87%) but differed for the SGF-MH (98% vs 67%; p less than 0.001). Logistic regression was used to develop a mathematic model for interaction of the variables and determined two first-order interactions: caval size and limb position and caval size and type of filter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In experiment 1, 20 CL grafts and 20 control PTFE grafts, each 5 cm in length and 4 mm in diameter, were interposed into both carotid and femoral arteries of 10 dogs. In experiment 2, 12 HP grafts (90 microns mean internodal distance) and 12 control PTFE grafts were implanted in six dogs. Indium 111-labeled platelets were injected intravenously and the grafts were retrieved 48 hours later. Radioactivity of the grafts and a control segment of the carotid artery was counted. A graft platelet accumulation index (GPAI) was calculated as the ratio of emission from the graft compared to that from the control segment. The GPAI of the CL graft was significantly less than the GPAI of the control graft in both the carotid (control 29.7 +/- 5.46, CL 22.3 +/- 6.55; n = 9 [p < 0.05]) and the femoral arteries (control 30.7 +/- 9.65, CL 22.0 +/- 6.59; n = 9 [p < 0.05]). There was no significant difference in GPAI between the control and HP grafts in the carotid arteries (control 30.6 +/- 11.8, HP 31.5 +/- 9.71; n = 6) and in the femoral arteries (control 31.5 +/- 7.88, HP 34.0 +/- 4.97; n = 6). Carbon lining decreases platelet accumulation on PTFE grafts in the early postoperative period, and HP grafts do not exhibit increased platelet uptake.",

    "abstract": "Seventeen arterial bypass procedures distal to the wrist have been performed in 13 men and two women at the Oregon Health Sciences University during the past 9 years. Ten patients had traumatic true or false aneurysms of the ulnar artery with digital embolization. Five patients with end-stage renal disease had severe hand and finger ischemia manifested by rest pain or digital ulceration resulting from widespread forearm and hand arterial occlusions. Patients with aneurysms of the ulnar artery underwent excision and reversed autogenous vein grafting (n = 11) from the distal ulnar artery in the forearm to the superficial palmar arch. All the patients with end-stage renal disease had severe occlusive disease of the forearm and hand arteries and underwent a variety of procedures including radial-radial bypass (n = 2), ulnar-ulnar bypass (n = 2), radial-radial bypass with takedown of a Brescia-Cimino fistula (n = 1), and brachial-radial bypass (n = 1). High-quality upper extremity and magnification hand arteriography was essential for operative planning and was available on all patients. Distal saphenous vein from the ankle or foot was the graft source in 16 procedures and basilic vein the source in one procedure. All operations were performed with headlight illumination, optical loupes, fine sutures, and microvascular instruments. There were no operative deaths or major complications. The mean follow-up period was 14 months. Of the 17 grafts, 16 remained patent by clinical and vascular lab criteria. The single occlusion occurred in an ulnar aneurysm bypass and was accompanied only by mild intolerance to cold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Because simultaneous noninvasive noncontrast imaging of cervical and cerebral vasculature and brain is possible with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and imaging (MRI), the following study was undertaken from July 1990 to January 1992. One hundred twenty-eight patients were examined with General Electric 1.5 Tesla MRI systems. Axially acquired volumetric three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA with 0.7 mm3 voxel size with regional maximum intensity projection after processing followed a two-dimensional time-of-flight localizing sequence. These two MRA sequences combined with spin-echo parenchymal brain MRI were compared with duplex scans, contrast angiograms, and surgical findings. Blinded readings by a radiologist and vascular surgeon allowed comparison of grades of luminal diameter narrowing (normal, mild, moderate, severe, and occluded) seen on MRA to be compared with those of Doppler and contrast angiography. Excluding 12 nondiagnostically imaged internal carotid arteries (10 MRA) and limiting duplex correlation to within 5 days of the MRA examination allowed critical appraisal of 182 internal carotid arteries. Exact correlation of grade of stenosis was obtained by the radiologist in 136 (74.7%) of 182 arteries and the surgeon in 138 (75.8%) of 182 arteries. Spearman rank correlation analysis found rank correlation coefficients of 0.88 (p < 0.001) and 0.83 (p < 0.001), respectively, for the radiologist and vascular surgeon. Disagreement one category apart was found by the radiologist in 35 studies (19.3%) and the surgeon in 28 studies (15.4%). Two or more grades of disagreement were found by the radiologist in 11 studies (6%) and the surgeon in 16 studies (8.8%). Contrast angiogram-MRA agreement was found in 86% of 36 internal carotid arteries. The degree of stenosis detected by MRA was concordant with surgical findings in 39 of 40 patients. Thus MRA emerges as a useful and accurate method of obtaining cerebrovascular evaluation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "To assess the agreement between magnetic resonance angiography and conventional angiography in the evaluation of carotid stenosis, 61 carotid arteries of 40 patients were studied by combined two- and three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography and conventional angiography. Stenosis of the internal carotid artery was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, critical, or complete occlusion. In 42 arteries, the degree of stenosis according to magnetic resonance angiography correlated exactly to that found by conventional angiography. In the remaining 19 carotid arteries, the magnetic resonance angiographic measurement of stenosis differed from the conventional angiographic measurement by only one size category. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.95 (p < 0.001). This study showed that by combining information from two- and three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiographic studies and making use of the advantages of each method, magnetic resonance angiography was comparable to conventional angiography in determining carotid stenosis. Magnetic resonance angiography tended to demonstrate a higher level of stenosis when there was a discrepancy. These data demonstrate that magnetic resonance angiography is a steadily improving technology. Although additional studies need to be done, it seems clear that magnetic resonance angiography will be an imaging modality comparable in accuracy to conventional angiography.",

    "abstract": "Polytetrafluoroethylene interposition grafts were used for carotid reconstruction in 26 operations performed in 23 patients during a 7-year period. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 66 years. The indication for interposition graft placement was recurrent stenosis with inability to perform endarterectomy in nine operations, a severe kink or technical problem during endarterectomy in nine, aneurysmal changes of the artery in six, and thrombosis of the endarterectomy site segment with stroke in two. There were no perioperative deaths and no further perioperative neurologic complications. Follow-up with performance of yearly duplex scans was obtained in all patients, and the mean duration of follow-up was 36 months. One patient (4%) died of end-stage pulmonary disease during the study interval. Occlusion of the polytetrafluoroethylene graft occurred at 12 months in one patient (4%). Hemodynamically significant restenosis developed in two patients (8%), and two patients (8%) had mild restenosis. Evidence of a second restenosis developed in three of the nine patients who underwent polytetrafluoroethylene interposition graft placement for carotid restenosis. On the basis of our study results, we conclude that polytetrafluoroethylene can be used effectively for carotid reconstruction when an interposition graft is required. However, recurrent stenosis occurs. Patients who undergo polytetrafluoroethylene interposition graft placement for carotid restenosis appear to be at high risk for a second restenosis.",

    "abstract": "We prospectively analyzed adverse effects of aspirin in a multicentered cooperative study undertaken to determine the role of endarterectomy in the treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Persons with active peptic ulcer disease or known intolerance to aspirin were excluded from the study. Patients initially received 650 mg aspirin twice daily. After a 54-month recruitment period, 444 patients in 11 centers were followed up for as many as 8 years (mean 47.9 +/- 27.9 months). Patients intolerant to 650 mg aspirin twice daily could be switched to enteric-coated aspirin or \"low-dose\" aspirin (80 to 325 mg daily). At the conclusion of the study, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of aspirin usage and complications. Overall, there were 757 episodes reported wherein adjustments in study medications were made, including cessation and change in formulation or dosage. At the conclusion of the study, at the time of death, or at occurrence of a neurologic end point, 16% of patients were off medication entirely, 51% had been converted to enteric-coated aspirin, and only 33% were taking regular aspirin with 27% of those having been placed on a reduced dosage. Adverse reactions were ascertained from 4954 patient visit records. In all there were a total of 837 adverse reactions reported, or one in every 5.9 visits. The most frequently reported reaction was heartburn or stomach pain for which 372 episodes were reported in 184 (42%) patients. Nausea or vomiting occurred on 79 occasions in 58 patients, and bloody stools were reported 52 times in 41 patients. We conclude that high-dose aspirin therapy for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is poorly tolerated and that adverse reactions even to low-dose enteric-coated aspirin are common even in patients screened for aspirin intolerance.",

    "abstract": "The CHAT classification separates various current and historical presentations of cerebrovascular disease in an effort to determine important prognostic clues for management and prognosis. To evaluate known risk factors for late stroke and death, we followed up for an average of 44 months 633 patients who had undergone 714 carotid operations. We analyzed the indication for surgery (by CHAT) and the effect of preoperative risk factors (age, hypertension, cardiac disease, tobacco use, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, renal disease, pulmonary disease, and total risk factor score) on the end points of late stroke and death. Ipsilateral stroke was uncommon after carotid endarterectomy: with life-table analysis, the probability of late stroke at 5 years after carotid endarterectomy was 3%. Among the 127 patients with amaurosis fugax, the incidence of late stroke and of mortality was a combined total of 1% per year, and the 17 patients who had been first seen with permanent ocular stroke (blindness) fared equally well. The 28 patients who were first seen with vertebrobasilar symptoms and were treated by carotid endarterectomy also fared particularly well, with no late strokes or deaths within the first 5 years. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the various indications for carotid endarterectomy were associated with differing patterns of risk factors as significant predictors of late stroke or death. For patients first seen with asymptomatic lesions, only diabetes was an important predictor for late stroke (p = 0.05) and renal disease was the only marker for early death (p = 0.05). On the other hand, those factors were not significant risk factors for patients first seen with amaurosis fugax, for whom tobacco use was a negative predictor for stroke (p = 0.06) and male gender a negative predictor for early death (p = 0.03). After cortical transient ischemic attacks and carotid endarterectomy, there were no risk factors predictive of late stroke or of death. For patients with prior stroke, age was a very strong predictor of stroke (p = 0.01) and both age and a history of cardiac disease were significant risk factors for early death (p = 0.007). In contrast to the results in reports of patients treated medically for transient ischemic attacks and stroke, we found that several risk factors appeared to play relatively minor roles. In conclusion, stroke after carotid endarterectomy was uncommon, least common after ocular symptoms, and most likely after permanent cortical stroke. Specific risk factors were less important for patients after carotid endarterectomy than for the medically treated stroke patient.",

    "abstract": "Although numerous operations have been devised for lymphedema, most surgeons manage this vexing condition by nonsurgical means. Previous studies by us showed that high-pressure (90 to 100 torr) sequential external pneumatic compression (SEP) reduced both limb girth and volume in a lymphedematous extremity. To assess the long-term effects of a program entailing (1) SEP, (2) elastic compression stockings to maintain the post-SEP girth, and (3) daily skin care, we reviewed the long-term courses of 49 patients managed by one surgeon. Limb girths measured at nine levels on the limb were obtained serially in follow-up (mean 25 months) by an independent observer to provide an objective response to therapy. The relative reduction in lymphedematous tissue was determined by the difference between the pretreatment, postacute treatment, and long-term treatment girths at nine points in the limb. In long-term follow-up, 26 of the patients maintained a full response (reduction at > 3 levels), whereas 10 maintained a partial response (reduction at < or = 3 levels). At late follow-up, calf and ankle girths were reduced by an absolute value of 5.37 +/- 1.01 and 4.63 +/- 0.88 cm in the full-response group and 5.43 +/- 1.58 and 3.98 +/- 1.18 cm in the partial-response group over pretreatment measurements. The degree of subcutaneous fibrosis in relationship to the duration of the edema appeared to influence results greatly. The treatment of lymphedema with SEP and compression stockings is associated with long-term maintenance of reduced limb girth in 90% of patients.",

Between 1979 and 1990, 232 patients received 241 heart transplants at our institution. Accelerated coronary atherosclerosis occurred in 45 (19%) of the 232 patients, typically appearing within 2 years of transplantation, whereas peripheral vascular disease (PVD) appeared in 23 (10%) of the 232 patients, usually within 3 years of transplantation. In the patients with PVD, 13 had occlusive disease, nine had aneurysms, and one patient suffered a vertebral artery dissection. Accelerated coronary atherosclerosis afflicted 12 (52%) of the 23 patients affected by PVD (p < 0.05) and preceded the development of PVD in all 12. Logistic regression analysis revealed risk factors predictive of the development of PVD after transplantation to be a pretransplant history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and posttransplant hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia (p < 0.05), with the presence of more than one risk factor increasing the probability of development of PVD. Those patients thus identified as at risk should be closely monitored for the development of PVD. Aggressive medical management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in this subpopulation may forestall or prevent the development of peripheral vascular disease after heart transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Anatomic observations were made during 200 consecutive transaxillary surgical procedures performed in 175 patients because of unremitting signs and symptoms of nerve or vascular compression at the thoracic outlet. There were 160 cases of brachial plexus compression and 40 cases of arterial or venous occlusion. In 132 (66%) of these cases, single or multiple abnormalities were recognized that represented developmental variations previously described in anatomic dissections or in embryologic studies. There were 17 cases of cervical rib or first thoracic rib abnormalities and 20 supernumerary scalene muscles. Developmental variations were identified in 86 scalene and 39 subclavius muscles or their insertions. Comparisons revealed a higher percentage of developmental anomalies in this group of patients than in consecutive anatomic investigations reported in unselected populations. This information was interpreted in light of recent embryologic studies and histochemical and morphometric ultrastructural studies of scalene muscle. The preponderance of evidence suggests that neurovascular compression in the region of the thoracic outlet derives from a combination of these factors: predisposing morphologic variations, structural modifications conditioned by functional requirements, and changes in fiber type or myosin isoform consequent to trauma. The correlation of clinical syndrome with morphologic characteristics alone was significant only for the Paget-Schroetter syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Few reports in the literature validate the use of color Doppler imaging (CDI) for the evaluation of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease, particularly in the tibial and peroneal arteries. This prospective, blinded study compares CDI to arteriography to address the following questions: (1) how well does CDI visualize arterial segments, including those below the knee? and (2) can CDI alone accurately classify the degree of occlusive disease? Twenty-nine men undergoing arteriography before a lower extremity arterial reconstructive procedure were studied with a color ultrasound scanner from the level of the inguinal ligament to the ankle. Color images were examined for the presence or absence of triphasic flow, poststenotic turbulence, color bruits, and collateral vessels. Among 636 arterial segments adequately visualized by arteriography, > or = 90% were identified with color Doppler imaging, including the tibial and peroneal arteries. With color criteria only, specificity was > or = 92% for distinguishing < 50% from > = 50% lesions and > or = 93% for differentiating patent from occluded arteries. Sensitivity for detecting an occlusion was > or = 97% in the superficial femoral (SFA) and popliteal arteries and 83% in the tibial vessels. For identifying a > or = 50% stenosis, sensitivity was > or = 85% in the SFA and popliteal arteries but only 79% and 86% in the posterior and anterior tibial arteries, respectively. CDI reliably identifies vessel location from the level of the groin to the ankle. For the detection of occlusions, CDI is an accurate screening tool in the SFA and popliteal arteries but is less accurate in the tibial vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study examined the accuracy of duplex ultrasound measurements of volume flow in a baboon model. Volume flow (Vf) through the external iliac artery was calculated from measurements of blood velocity averaged over several cardiac cycles (time-averaged velocity [TAV]) and vessel cross-sectional area (A) measured from the B-mode image: Vf = TAV x A. Fourteen anesthetized baboons were studied with a duplex scanner with a 7 MHz imaging transducer and 5 MHz pulsed Doppler. B-mode ultrasound measurements of external iliac artery diameters (2.5 +/- 0.2 mm) were used for calculation of cross-sectional area. Timed blood collections obtained through a cannula inserted into the common femoral artery and TAV measurements were obtained simultaneously during 6 to 15-second intervals. These measurements were repeated three to five times per animal with different flow rates each time. Flow rates ranged from 56 to 280 ml/min (170 +/- 54 ml/min). Average velocity was 55 +/- 17 cm/sec. There was no significant difference between the two methods of volume flow measurement (Student t test). Linear regression analysis revealed a high degree of correlation (r = 0.90, slope 0.95, and p = 0.0001). The absolute percentage error was 13% +/- 8%. Volume flow measured by duplex scanning correlates highly with timed blood collections. This method has potential application for the evaluation of diseased arteries and bypass grafts whose rates of flow and waveform patterns are similar to those of this experiment.",

    "abstract": "This study reports three-dimensional reconstruction of two-dimensional intravascular ultrasound images obtained along 5 cm vessel segments. Each three-dimensional image was produced by computerized \"stacking\" of a set of consecutive two-dimensional images (mode 90 images per set; range 32 to 256). Three-dimensional images (n = 26) were obtained from 11 human normal and atherosclerotic arteries (three in vitro and eight in vivo) and five in vivo canine studies. In vivo human examinations included three iliac, one deep, and three superficial femoral arteries and one aortic dissection. Five in vivo canine vessels (three iliac stenoses and two aortic dissections) were imaged before and after intraluminal stent deployment. Images were displayed on a gray-scale monitor, allowing examination of vessel images as complete cylinders or longitudinal hemisections in any user-defined plane. This enabled global examination of vascular segments and identified luminal shape, wall thickness, and distribution and morphology of plaques. Reconstructions of aortic dissections illustrated the extent of the dissection and produced an anatomic picture of the false lumen. Three-dimensional imaging enhanced stent deployment by identifying the site for deployment, dimensions of the vessel lumen, and changes in morphology after stent insertion. There was good correlation in vessel dimensions measured by angiography, two-dimensional intravascular ultrasonography and longitudinal gray-scale reconstructions (r = 0.74 to 0.95; p = 0.34 to 0.001) but poor correlation with measurements from three-dimensional surface-rendered images (r = 0.13 to 0.48; p = 0.42 to 0.87). We conclude that three-dimensional intravascular ultrasound imaging is an innovative new method for identifying the type, extent, and spatial configuration of arterial disease, with promising diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of this antibiotic-bonded graft in resisting infection after an in situ reconstruction of a previously infected prosthetic bypass. Eighty-three adult mongrel dogs underwent implantation of a 3 cm untreated Dacron graft into the infrarenal aorta. This initial graft was deliberately infected, at the time of operation, with 10(2) organisms of Staphylococcus aureus by direct inoculation. One week later, the dogs were reexplored, the retroperitoneum debrided, and the animals randomized to undergo an end-to-end in situ graft replacement with either one of two types of prosthetic grafts: group I (collagen, n = 36) received control collagen-impregnated knitted Dacron grafts; group II (rifampin, n = 47) received experimental collagen-rifampin-bonded Dacron grafts. Each group of animals was then subdivided to receive one of four treatment protocols: (a) no antibiotic therapy, (b) cephalosporin peritoneal irrigation solution (cefazolin 500 mg/1000 ml) during operation and two doses of cephalosporin (cefazolin, 500 mg intramuscularly) postoperatively, (c) treatment as in protocol group b plus 1 week of cephalosporin (cefazolin, 500 mg intramuscularly, twice daily), and (d) treatment as in protocol group b plus 2 weeks of cephalosporin (cefazolin, 500 mg intramuscularly, twice daily). All grafts were sterilely removed between 3 and 4 weeks after implantation. There were no anastomotic disruptions and all grafts were patent at the time of removal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Heparin, urokinase, and ancrod are agents used routinely to prevent and treat thrombosis, yet their effects on PMN function are unknown. Therefore human PMNs were obtained and incubated for 30 minutes with either saline solution or one of the following pharmacologic agents, each tested at three different concentrations: group 1, saline solution (control, n = 14); groups 2 through 4, heparin (5000 units/ml, n = 8; 2500 units/ml, n = 6; and 1250 units/ml, n = 6, respectively); groups 5 through 7, urokinase (50,000 units/ml, n = 8; 25,000 units/ml, n = 6; and 12,500 units/ml, n = 6, respectively), and groups 8 through 10, ancrod (70 units/ml, n = 8; 35 units/ml, n = 6; and 17.5 units/ml, n = 6). Superoxide anion production was measured by the reduction of cytochrome c in a spectrophotometric assay. Chemotaxis was evaluated by the number of PMNs migrating across a filter with a Neuro Probe chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, Md.). Phagocytosis was determined by the ingestion of opsonized zymosan particles by PMNs. Serum obtained from each PMN donor was used both to opsonize the zymosan and as a chemoattractant in the chemotaxis assay. Statistical comparison was evaluated by analysis of variance, and post hoc comparisons for each agent with control were performed with the unpaired Student t test. No agent, at any dose, significantly changed superoxide anion production compared with control cells. All three agents significantly inhibited PMN chemotaxis (p < 0.01). In the control group the number of PMNs counted was 27.6 +/- 4.9.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "True \"arteriosclerotic\" aneurysms of the superficial femoral artery, not associated with generalized dilatation of the common femoral or popliteal artery, are relatively rare. We report our experience with two isolated superficial femoral artery aneurysms and review the previous literature. An 88-year-old woman was first seen with thrombosis of a superficial femoral aneurysm and limb-threatening ischemia and had eventual limb loss as a result of occlusion of distal run-off vessels despite surgical revascularization. A 93-year-old man came to us with rupture and was treated with an interposition graft, which resulted in limb salvage. Review of 17 \"arteriosclerotic\" superficial femoral artery aneurysms in 14 patients whose cases were reported in the literature revealed a complication at presentation in 65%, rupture in 35%, thrombosis in 18%, and distal emboli in 12%. However, limb salvage was 94% and there were no perioperative deaths. Abdominal aortic aneurysms were discovered in 40%. Males (75%) were more common than females, and the average age was 77 years (range 61 to 93). Isolated superficial femoral artery aneurysms are rare and occur at an older average age than do other peripheral aneurysms, but their incidence is anticipated to increase with this growing segment of our population. In the absence of evidence of syphilitic, other infectious, immunologic, inflammatory, or connective-tissue disorders, these and other aneurysms are considered arteriosclerotic in origin, despite the absence of diffuse arteriosclerosis in many cases and controversy regarding the role of arteriosclerosis in their cause.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The presence of chronic inflammatory cells in the adventitia and media of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortic occlusive disease suggest an immunologic response. The purpose of this study is to determine whether normal or diseased infrarenal aortas liberate the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Twenty-six infrarenal aortic biopsies (5 aortic occlusive disease, 15 abdominal aortic aneurysms, and 6 cadaveric donors) were weighed, minced into small pieces, and incubated in media for 48 hours. Conditioned media was harvested at 48 hours and assayed for IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha with use of an ELISA assay. Comparison of groups was performed with a one-way analysis of variance. The constitutive IL-1 beta produced by abdominal aortic aneurysms was significantly different than that in cadaveric donors (908 +/- 194 pg/ml [SE] vs 100 +2- 30 pg/ml). There was no statistically significant difference between abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortic occlusive disease (908 +/- 194 pg/ml vs 604 +/- 256 pg/ml) or aortic occlusive disease and cadaveric donor (604 +/- 256 vs 100 +/- 30). In time-course studies for the release of IL-1 beta, abdominal aortic aneurysms demonstrated maximal release at 48 hours. IL-1 beta release was augmented by lipopolysaccharide in all categories. A dose response curve demonstrated maximal IL-1 beta release on stimulation with 5 micrograms/ml LPS. Constitutive TNF-alpha production was low, ranging from 13 +/- 1.5 pg/ml in cadaveric donor, to 20 pg/ml in aortic occlusive disease, and 24 +/- 11 pg/ml in abdominal aortic aneurysms. There was no augmentation in TNF-alpha with lipopolysaccharide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Complement activation has been associated with numerous clinical hazards such as platelet aggregation, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and renal dysfunction. The complement system is activated by exposure of different biomaterials to blood. Recently a watertight knitted Dacron aortic prosthesis impregnated with bovine collagen has been developed. One potential disadvantage is that this bovine collagen may activate the complement system and evoke the production of inflammatory mediators. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortic surgery with implantation of Dacron prosthesis on the complement system in the perioperative period and at 3 months after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 21). Twelve patients who had cholecystectomy served as controls. CH50 consumption and C3a generation were determined to study overall complement activation. Furthermore, C3a/C3 fractions were calculated. Finally, C4 and factor B consumption were determined to evaluate the complement stimulation via the classic and the alternative pathways, respectively. We found significant activation of the complement system during the operation in both the collagen group (CH50 consumption: 40%, p = 0.03; C4 consumption: 74%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 73%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction increase: 173%,p = 0.04), and the nonimpregnated group (CH50 consumption: 40%, p < 0.0001; C4 consumption: 71%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 76%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction increase: 165%, p = 0.025), with no statistically significant differences between the groups of prostheses. Activation was initiated via both the classic and the alternative pathway. This indicates aortic implantation significantly activates the complement system, but that collagen-impregnated prostheses do not stimulate the complement system any more than its nonsealed substrate. Comparing results in patients with vascular disease with controls, a significantly increased complement activation was observed in the vascular group (CH50 consumption: 40%, p < 0.0001; C4 consumption: 74%, p < 0.0001; factor B consumption: 75%, p < 0.0001; C3a/C3 fraction: 169%, p = 0.002), compared with the controls (CH50 consumption: 71%; C4 consumption: 104%; factor B consumption: 94%; C3a/C3 fraction: 119%, all p = NS), with statistical significant differences between the vascular group and cholecystectomies (CH50: p = 0.005; C4: p = 0.002; factor B: p < 0.0001, and C3a/C3 fraction: NS). This observation demonstrates that aortic surgery with the implantation of a Dacron prosthesis significantly activates the complement system.",

    "abstract": "Growth of vascular anastomoses is desirable in pediatric vascular surgery, especially in pediatric organ transplantation. Although absorbable suture has been shown to be superior to nonabsorbable suture in permitting growth of arterial anastomoses, the optimal suture material for venous anastomoses has not been established. To examine this in a porcine model, we performed bilateral primary end-to-end anastomoses of transected external jugular veins in 10, 4-week-old piglets. In each piglet one anastomosis was constructed with continuous absorbable 8-0 polyglyconate suture, whereas the contralateral anastomosis was constructed with continuous nonabsorbable 8-0 polypropylene suture. After 6 months the veins were excised, pressure fixed at 15 mm Hg for 2 hours, and examined grossly and histologically. Vein diameter was measured by contrast radiography at the anastomosis and 1 cm proximal and distal to the anastomosis. Vein cross-sectional area 1 cm from the anastomosis was similar in the two groups: polyglyconate 95.7 +/- 12.3 mm2 versus polypropylene 95.3 +/- 9.7 mm2. However, polyglyconate anastomoses had greater cross-sectional area (polyglyconate 72.8 +/- 7.9 mm2 vs polypropylene 51.8 +/- 6.0 mm2; p < 0.05). In addition, at 6 months polyglyconate anastomoses had a greater percentage of growth (polyglyconate 207% vs polypropylene 118%; p < 0.05) compared with native vein cross-sectional area (23.7 +/- 0.39 mm2) from control pigs at 4 weeks of age. On histologic examination, polyglyconate had dissolved entirely in six cases and was present but in varying degrees of dissolution in the other four; in contrast, polypropylene was identifiable at all anastomoses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The natural history of venous reconstruction (VR) in terms of patency and clinical outcome after vascular trauma has not been well documented. This study consists of 32 patients who had VR performed for extremity vascular trauma and were available for long-term assessment (mean follow-up time 49 months, range 6 to 108 months). The types of repair performed were as follows: lateral venorrhaphy (simple repair) (56%), interposition grafting (22%), patch repair (12.5%), and end-to-end repair (9.5%). Seventeen patients underwent venography after the operation with documentation of repair patency in eight patients (46%) and thrombosis in nine (54%). Only two patients had significant clinical edema at follow-up examination. Noninvasive venous evaluation consisted of Doppler ultrasonography, impedance plethysmography, photoplethysmography, and color-flow duplex scanning (CFDS). The photoplethysmography-derived venous refilling time of the injured extremity was 34.9 +/- 16.2 seconds whereas that of the contralateral noninjured extremity was 36.8 +/- 16.1 seconds (p = 0.5). Based on standard criteria for CFDS, 90% of VRs were patent. Eight repairs that were patent in the early postoperative period remained patent on CFDS. Of the nine repairs with early thrombosis, eight were assessed as patent on follow-up CFDS. In conclusion, VR is a durable surgical procedure associated with minimal morbidity, good long-term patency, and preservation of venous competence. The natural history of thrombosed VRs appears to be one of thrombus absorption with recanalization.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of venous grafting, we reviewed the management and clinical course of 28 patients (21 males and seven females) who underwent 29 reconstructions of large veins for benign disease. There were 12 patients with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, two with subclavian vein thrombosis, and 15 with occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) or iliac veins. One of these patients underwent both IVC and SVC reconstructions. Reconstruction of the SVC was performed with spiral saphenous vein graft (SSVG) in nine patients and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) in three. All seven straight SSVGs had documented patency at a median of 7 months (2 weeks to 5 years) after reconstruction. Six patients had complete relief of symptoms. Two patients with bifurcated SSVG had early occlusion of one graft limb. Two of the three ePTFE grafts needed early thrombectomy. One graft reoccluded at 6 months and two were patent at 2 and 5 years. The two subclavian vein reconstructions with axillary-jugular ePTFE grafts with an arteriovenous fistula had documented early patency. Both patients had rapid resolution of symptoms. The IVC or iliac vein was reconstructed with ePTFE graft in 11 patients, SSVG in three, and Dacron in one. A femorofemoral arteriovenous fistula was added in eight patients with ePTFE grafts. Seven of the 11 ePTFE grafts had documented patency at the last follow-up (median 9 months; range 2 weeks to 5 years). None of the three SSVGs had documented long-term patency. The one Dacron cavoatrial graft occluded at 3 years. A straight SSVG continues to be our first choice for SVC replacement. Short, large-diameter ePTFE grafts perform the best in the abdomen. Femorocaval or long iliocaval grafts need an arteriovenous fistula to maintain patency. Long-term patency after closure of the fistula is still unknown. Femorocaval grafts with poor venous inflow have limited chance of success. Failed or failing grafts may be salvaged by early thrombectomy. Venous reconstruction to treat selected patients with symptoms with large vein occlusion continues to be a viable option.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the late clinical, hemodynamic, and anatomic results of superficial femoral vein ligation performed in 35 extremities that were followed an average of 13 1/2 years (range, 5 to 22 years). Indications for interruption were to prevent recurrent embolization from distal deep venous thrombosis (14 cases), to prevent emboli in patients with contraindication to anticoagulants (eight cases), to prevent distal reflux in selected patients undergoing iliofemoral thrombectomy (11 cases), and to control reflux in failed venous reconstruction (two cases). Ligation was effective in the prevention of pulmonary emboli as indicated by no significant clinical events and 15 negative postligation ventilation-perfusion scans. Long-term clinical follow-up showed normal (class 0) or near-normal (class 1) extremities in 83%. Fourteen percent developed mild to moderate symptoms of pain or swelling but without ulceration (class 2), and only one case (3%) had ulcerative sequelae (class 3). The only two findings that correlated with worse clinical outcome were the presence of an incompetent profunda femoris or an obstructed greater saphenous vein. Profunda femoris reflux was found in 60% (3/5) of patients with class 2 or 3 sequelae, which was significantly higher than the 14% (3/22) found in those patients with class 0 or 1 results (p < 0.05). Obstruction of the greater saphenous vein was found in 50% of those patients with class 2 or 3 results as opposed to 9% with class 0 or 1 results (p = 0.05). A large collateral vessel between the profunda femoris and the distal superficial femoral or popliteal vein was associated with poor long-term results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Clinical deterioration of patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) has been well described and a standardized classification has been proposed. The progressive hemodynamic deterioration producing these clinical findings is less well appreciated. This study examines and correlates venous hemodynamics with clinical severity in patients with CVD. Two hundred seventy-four extremities from 149 patients with varying degrees of CVD and 56 extremities from 28 symptom-free volunteers were evaluated clinically and hemodynamically. Each limb was assessed for functional venous volume, degree of valvular insufficiency, efficiency of the calf muscle pump, and noninvasive estimate of ambulatory venous pressure. In addition, exercise venous pressures were recorded in 56 extremities from 36 patients and 9 extremities from 6 volunteers. As CVD progresses from class 0 to class 2, venous volume expands, valvular function deteriorates, the calf muscle pump becomes inefficient, and ambulatory venous hypertension develops. However, once extremities develop brawny edema or hyperpigmentation, further deterioration of limb hemodynamics does not occur. Patients with deep venous obstruction have more severe valvular insufficiency, calf muscle pump dysfunction, and ambulatory venous hypertension than have patients without evidence of obstruction. Residual volume fraction offers a reliable noninvasive estimate of ambulatory venous pressure (r = 0.76), although its correlation was significantly better for patients without venous obstruction (r = 0.86) than for those with obstruction (r = 0.40; p < 0.05). Deterioration in venous hemodynamics parallels clinical severity through class 2. Once brawny edema and hyperpigmentation occur, ulceration develops without additional deterioration of venous hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) has long been considered a primary thrombotic process, but recent experience suggests that it may commonly result from repeated mechanical compression. Increased awareness of the pathophysiology of this syndrome can allow timely, improved diagnostic screening and the use of specific surgical intervention to relieve the venous consequences. During the past 15 years we have treated six patients with mechanical compression in the thoracic outlet causing surgically correctable venous occlusive problems. There were four men and two women with an average age of 38 years (range 26 to 53 years). All patients exhibited pain, swelling, and cyanosis of the upper extremity, with worsening venous congestion on abduction of the arm. Five of six patients were originally treated for effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein with arm elevation and anticoagulation; two also underwent immediate thrombolytic therapy with urokinase. Venography was prompted in each case by positional symptoms during follow-up and showed irregular stenosis of the subclavian vein adjacent to the first rib. All patients underwent extended first rib resection and circumferential venolysis (one patient underwent bilateral procedures); one was performed through a transaxillary approach, two through a supraclavicular approach, and four through a new, \"paraclavicular\" approach. All subclavian veins appeared normal after venolysis. Five of six patients also underwent complete scalenectomy and brachial plexus neurolysis. In each patient, venous and neurogenic symptoms resolved and venography confirmed a patent subclavian vein, with follow-up ranging from 11 months to 13 years (mean 3.8 years).",

    "abstract": "One hundred thirty-nine consecutive patients (average age 70.1 years) who were able to walk with a swollen leg were seen at the clinic where diagnosis of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) extending to the pelvis was confirmed by injecting microspheres labeled with technetium 99m into the dorsal foot vein (radionuclide venography). Thirty-nine (28%) of these patients had malignant disease. Perfusion lung scans performed immediately after radionuclide venography were supplemented by inhalation scans (99mTc-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid aerosol) in case of perfusion defects. During scintigraphy patterns highly indicative of pulmonary embolism (PE) were found in 80 patients (58%), but only 11 (7.9%) had minor clinical symptoms. All patients were admitted to the ward, were given standard heparin subcutaneously (35,000 to 40,000 units/24 hr) and firm bandages, and were encouraged to walk. After 11 days pulmonary scintigraphy was repeated and revealed no change in 55 of 59 patients without PE and in 40 of 80 patients with PE. Thirty-three patients (23.7%) showed regression of perfusion defects. New PE developed in 11 patients (7.9%, four without and seven with previous PE). Autopsy revealed that one 80-year-old patient with prostatic carcinoma had died of massive PE. When comparing this frequency of newly developed PE during ambulation with the occurrence of PE after bed rest, according to the literature, it is no more dangerous for a mobile patient with proximal DVT to walk wearing a firm bandage than it is for the patient to be in bed. Therefore we recommend treating mobile patients with DVT by use of anticoagulation and firm compression bandages and without immobilization.",

    "abstract": "Although there is a broad consensus on the optimum approach to the management of venous thromboembolism, there are few data from which to assess the extent of compliance with these recommendations. A community-wide study was therefore conducted in 16 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts to assess the clinical management of venous thromboembolism. Based on validated discharge diagnostic codes, there were 1231 clinically recognized cases of venous thromboembolism, 0.8% of 148,730 discharges in the 18-month period from July 1, 1988, to December 31, 1989. Eighty-one percent of study patients were admitted with signs or symptoms of acute venous thromboembolism. Ninety-seven percent of patients were treated with either heparin, warfarin, or inferior vena caval filter. Intravenous heparin was given to 89% of patients (mean bolus 6674 IU; mean duration 6.6 days). After heparin administration, there was a mean delay of 2.3 days in starting warfarin. Assuming a corresponding decrease in the length of hospital stay, appreciable cost savings could have been realized by earlier start of oral anticoagulation. An inferior vena cava filter was placed in 14% of patients. There was a clinically recognized in-hospital recurrence of venous thromboembolism during treatment in 2% of patients. Despite a slightly lower rate of compliance with recommended treatment regimens in nonteaching hospitals, and despite less frequent use of the inferior vena cava filter, there was no significant difference in the rate of in-hospital recurrence of clinically recognized venous thromboembolism in 10 nonteaching hospitals compared with six teaching hospitals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Eighty-four patients (52 men and 32 women) ranging in age from 18 to 90 years (mean 67 years) were identified. Filters were required because of contraindications to anticogulation in 64% anticoagulation failure in 25%, and preoperative prophylaxis in 11% of patients. The underlying disease was lower extremity deep vein thrombosis in 50% and pulmonary embolism in 45% of patients. Five percent of patients received prophylactic filters without documented thromboembolism. All filters were placed percutaneously by interventional radiologists, 77 through the common femoral vein and 7 through the internal jugular vein. Three types of filters were used. One procedure-related death occurred because of acute IVC occlusion. Fatal pulmonary embolism within 48 hours after filter placement was documented in one patient and suspected in one late death. No other clinically apparent pulmonary embolism or leg swelling occurred after filter placement. Minor complications related to filter placement occurred in 13 patients, but none required operative intervention. Analysis of complication rates of the three filter types was precluded by the small sample size. After a mean follow-up of 11 months, 42 patients (50%) had died of malignancy (n = 25), multisystem organ failure (MSOF; n = 7), cardiovascular events (n = 4), recurrent pulmonary embolism (n = 2), cerebrovascular events (n = 4), or an unknown cause (n = 1).

There were four men and two women; the average age was 49 years (range 32 to 62 years). All limbs were Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery clinical stage III (venous ulcer), and descending phlebography showed grade 4 reflux in six limbs, grade 3 reflux in one limb, and grade 2 reflux in two limbs. In addition to FVV, five limbs underwent subfascial ligation of incompetent perforators and three limbs underwent ligation and stripping of superficial varicosities. Two limbs underwent polytetrafluoroethylene wrapping of the valvuloplasty. The last five valvuloplasties underwent angioscopic evaluation of the repair, and the last two procedures were closed valvuloplasties (without venotomy). Follow-up averaged 20.3 months (range 2 to 51 months). In all patients ulcers healed without recurrence. There were two perioperative deep vein thromboses in the polytetrafluoroethylene wrapped repairs. All superficial femoral veins were patent by duplex scanning at the time of follow-up. Venous refill time measured by light reflection rheography did not improve after surgery.

Of the 56 lower limbs, 22 (40%) had severe swelling and hyperpigmentation with or without ulcer (classes 2 and 3). Adequacy of the clinical severity classification was supported by the hemodynamic results. Radiologic and ultrasound findings were described by axial grading, multilevel/multisystem point, and multisegment scoring systems. Applying these evaluation systems, the phlebographic and scan results correlated poorly. There was no relationship between the radiologically obtained average reflux grade or points and the clinical severity. An erect quantitative duplex Doppler test assessed by the multisegment scoring system correlated best with the severity classification. The predictive value of this test to diagnose severe reflux leading to severe symptoms (classes 2 and 3) was 77% compared with 35% to 44% for descending phlebography. The study suggests that erect quantitative segmental duplex Doppler reflects the degree and distribution of venous reflux more accurately than does descending venography.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were designed to study functional changes in superficial leg veins of patients with primary varicosity. Excess segments were taken from 19 patients undergoing elective vein resection. Excess segments of greater saphenous veins taken from 13 patients undergoing coronary or lower extremity arterial bypass were used as controls. These rings, some with endothelium deliberately removed, were suspended for the measurement of isometric force in organ chambers. Segments of veins were also evaluated with respect to their total protein content, endothelin content, and histologic structure. In varicose veins, maximal contractions in response to potassium chloride (n = 9), norepinephrine (n = 9), and endothelin (n = 4) were reduced 71.1%, 78.2%, and 75.6%, respectively, compared with contractions in control veins (p < 0.01). In addition, no differences were detected in the maximal tension or tissue sensitivity (EC50) between segments of nonvaricose greater saphenous vein and adjacent varicose tributaries from the same patient. Rings with and without endothelium contracted similarly. In varicose veins, endothelium-dependent relaxations produced by the calcium ionophore A23187 were attenuated 89.7% compared with relaxations in controls (n = 6, p < 0.01). In veins from patients with primary varicosity, endothelium-independent relaxations produced by nitric oxide (n = 6) and forskolin (n = 3) were diminished 86.8% (p < 0.01) and 65.6% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with relaxations in control veins. In primary varicose veins, protein content was decreased (n = 17, p < 0.01) and endothelin content increased (n = 17, p = 0.1) compared with those values in control veins (n = 5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The development of an objective, noninvasive method to assess the hemodynamic effects of venous surgery has long been awaited. Previous methods used to evaluate the results of surgery for varicose veins and venous stasis ulceration have been limited in their quantitative assessment. Now, by use of air plethysmography (APG), we can accurately quantify the effectiveness of corrective venous surgery. Twenty-five extremities that had evidence of venous insufficiency were examined with use of APG before and after venous surgical procedures. Surgery was directed at specific sites of venous incompetence as defined by physical examination and high-resolution duplex imaging. Twenty-one extremities underwent ligation and stripping of the greater saphenous vein. In these patients, APG showed an improvement in venous reflux as demonstrated by a decrease in the venous filling index from 6.6 +/- 0.7 ml/sec to 1.8 +/- 0.3 ml/sec (p = 0.0001) and venous volume from 177.1 +/- 14.5 ml to 139.2 +/- 8.9 ml (p = 0.0008). In addition, these patients showed a mild improvement in calf muscle pump function as noted by an improvement in ejection fraction from 45.8 +/- 2.0% to 50.8% +/- 2.5% (p = 0.07). The residual volume fraction decreased from 45.0% +/- 3.4% to 42.0% +/- 3.7%, a difference that was not statistically significant (p = 0.4). Four extremities with grade III chronic venous insufficiency underwent popliteal vein valve transplantation with use of an autogenous axillary vein valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Our recent finding that less than 50% of late postendarterectomy strokes are related to recurrent carotid stenosis led us to question the utility of routine postendarterectomy duplex surveillance (RpCEADS) in the prevention of late stroke. To evaluate our RpCEADS program, we reviewed our postoperative duplex studies and correlated their results with clinical data. A total of 1053 postendarterectomy scans was carried out on 348 carotid arteries (258 patients) (3.0 +/- 0.1 studies/artery) during an average follow-up of 52.6 (+/- 2.3) months. Less than 50% of recurrent carotid stenosis was documented throughout follow-up in 292 (83.9%) of 348 arteries. Recurrent carotid stenosis of greater than 50% or occlusion of either the common or internal carotid artery was noted in the remaining 56 arteries (16.1%). Of the 56 duplex-detected recurrent stenoses, only two (3.6%) resulted directly in an unheralded stroke, whereas eight (14.3%) underwent prophylactic reoperation, eight (14.3%) resulted in transient ischemia requiring reoperation, eight (14.3%) occluded without causing stroke, and 29 (51.8%) remained asymptomatic and did not progress to occlusion. Assuming that each of our eight patients who underwent prophylactic reoperation would have had a stroke if operation had not been carried out and our two unheralded strokes could have been prevented with more rigorous follow-up, RpCEADS might have prevented late stroke related to 10 (2.9%) of 348 arteries in 10 (3.9%) of 258 patients after surgery. All other cases of duplex-detected recurrent carotid stenosis or occlusion were asymptomatic or manifest by transient cerebral ischemia. Therefore RpCEADS cannot be justified as a means of preventing late strokes related to recurrent stenosis.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis-related groups have encouraged physicians to become more efficient in the care of their patients; often, however, raising the question of safety. For 3 years all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy at our institution were monitored in the intensive care unit for 24 hours and the majority were discharged on the second postoperative day. After review of these patient's hospital records and direct patient interviews, it was clear that many patients did not require a stay in the intensive care unit and could be discharged on the first postoperative day. In January 1991 a prospective policy was established to evaluate the safety and efficacy of outpatient arteriography, same-day admission, selective use of the intensive care unit, and early discharge on the first postoperative day when feasible. During a 10-month period all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy at our institution were evaluated (n = 52). Eleven patients had had a prior stroke (21%), 31 had either amaurosis fugax or transient ischemic attacks (60%), and 10 had no symptoms (19%). The arteriogram for 49 of the patients was obtained on an outpatient basis or during a prior admission, and these patients were admitted to the hospital on the day of operation. Nine patients were placed under general anesthesia and had shunting procedures, and 43 patients had cervical block anesthesia, eight of whom had shunting (19%). Only five patients required an intensive care unit stay for either hypertension, hypotension, or neurologic complication (one transient ischemic attack and one minor stroke). Forty-six patients (88%) were discharged on the first postoperative day; average length of stay was 1.29 days/patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Arterial occlusive disease occurred in the aortic arch vessels (n = 8), visceral aortic vessels (n = 1), and aortofemoral vessels (n = 16). Presenting symptoms were claudication (n = 8), rest pain or nonhealing ulcers (n = 7), transient ischemic attacks (n = 6), asymptomatic bruit (n = 1), and renal insufficiency (n = 1). Reconstructive operations included anatomic bypass (n = 10), extra-anatomic bypass (n = 4), patch angioplasty (n = 5), endarterectomy (n = 3), and resection with interposition graft (n = 1). In this group of patients there were no major perioperative wound complications or other major radiation-associated morbidity. Five patients had late graft infections that manifested from 2 to 5 years after surgery. All occurred in anatomic regions where the bypass graft passed through previously irradiated tissues. Presenting symptoms of infection included a draining groin sinus (n = 3) or soft tissue abscess (n = 2). In all cases the graft had not incorporated into the surrounding tissues when passing through the irradiated area. Treatment included graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass through nonirradiated tissue. One patient died of systemic sepsis.

    "abstract": "To assess the role of noninvasive tests--quantitative photoplethysmography, air plethysmography, and quantitative duplex scanning, we compared a group of normal (group N, eight limbs) volunteers to patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency who were stratified according to the degree of reflux seen on the current \"gold standard,\" descending phlebography. Group M (10 limbs) had mild (grades 0 to 2) reflux, and group S (10 limbs) had severe (grades 3 to 4) reflux as determined by phlebography. Quantitative photoplethysmography could identify normal from abnormal limbs but could not distinguish the severity of reflux. Air plethysmography was used to calculate venous filling index, ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction. Ejection fraction was the same in all groups. Venous filling index could not significantly distinguish the degree of reflux (group M vs group S) but increased as reflux increased. Residual volume fraction was considerably higher in group S. Quantitative duplex valve closure time was measured in the superficial femoral and popliteal veins, with the values added together in each limb to give a total valve closure time (TVCT). A TVCT value greater than or equal to 4 seconds correlated best with severe phlebographic reflux, with a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 94%, and an accuracy of 93%. This value was confirmed as the best test for venous reflux by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Thus in the evaluation of patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency who are candidates for phlebography and surgery, quantitative duplex measurement of TVCT gives the best noninvasive assessment of the severity of deep venous reflux.",

    "abstract": "To examine the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on complications in dialysis access surgery, a review was performed on patients undergoing hemodialysis at two major metropolitan medical centers over a 30-month period. One hundred eight patients underwent a total of 169 graft procedures; mean follow-up was 14 1/2 months. There were 18 (17%) patients who were HIV-positive who had no symptoms, 11 (10%) patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 79 (73%) patients who were HIV-negative. Twenty-three percent (25/108) of patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), most of whom also had either AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection. Dialysis procedures included 44 autogenous reconstructions (26%), 117 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (69%), and 8 (5%) procedures of unknown type. Arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis was a frequent complication. The overall 12-month graft patency rate was 41%, and patients with HIV infection or a history of IVDA did not have a significantly increased risk of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of PTFE as opposed to autogenous reconstruction was the only significant risk factor found for occlusion within the first 12 months after operation (p < 0.01). Twenty-five graft infections occurred, all in PTFE grafts. The PTFE graft infection rate was 43% in patients with AIDS, 36% in patients who were HIV-positive and who had no symptoms, and 15% in patients who were HIV-negative (p < 0.05). Patients with a history of IVDA had a 41% PTFE graft infection rate versus a 13% infection rate in patients who did not have a history of IVDA (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Five hundred and twenty consecutive heart transplant cases (458 adult, 62 pediatric) were reviewed to assess the impact of peripheral vascular problems. Peritransplant interventions requiring vascular cannulation (e.g., intraaortic balloon pump procedures, catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart, femoral bypass) resulted in 10 complications that necessitated nine surgical procedures. Five aortic aneurysms (three infrarenal and two suprarenal) were resected. There was one death unrelated to the aneurysm resection. Sixteen patients had evidence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). There were three deaths in this group, none directly related to the PVD. Three patients required vascular reconstruction (axillobifemoral, bilateral femoral distal and popliteal endarterectomy) in the posttransplant period, all for advanced ischemic symptoms. Except for one patient in whom ischemia-related ulcers developed on the heels, all patients had improved or stable symptoms that did not require intervention. There were no limb losses or vascular infections. We conclude that despite the rigors of posttransplant immunosuppression, patients with stable manifestations of PVD may successfully undergo heart transplantation and subsequent vascular reconstruction, when indicated, without prohibitive risk.",

    "abstract": "Controversy continues in the selection of optimal management of major venous injuries. We analyzed our experience with 191 major venous injuries in 163 patients (1986 to 1991). The mechanism of injury was gunshot (112), stab (44), blunt (six), and iatrogenic (one). Eighteen cervicothoracic, 51 caval, 30 iliac, 36 visceral, and 56 extremity veins were involved. Of the 191 injuries, 105 (54.9%) were repaired (lateral repair 76, end-to-end anastomosis 15, vein patch four, vein graft five, Gore-Tex graft four, and compilation one). Of the remaining venous injuries, 64 were ligated as a result of hemodynamic instability. Twenty-two injuries in 18 patients did not receive treatment because 16 of 18 patients died before vascular control or repair. The overall amputation rate was 1.2%, and the mortality rate was 28.2% (46/163). The highest mortality rate occurred in those patients who required resuscitative thoracotomy (100%, p < 0.00001), retrohepatic caval injuries (90%, p < 0.0004), and multiple venous injuries (81.8%, p < 0.00001). Seventeen patients underwent fasciotomies (15 prophylactic and two therapeutic). Clinical or measured venous hypertension by stump pressure assisted in deciding for venous repair in 20 patients. A significant decrease in venous stump pressure (p < 0.000001) was noted after venous reconstruction. Thus the decision to ligate or repair venous injuries correlated primarily with (1) hemodynamic stability, and in stable patients, with (2) extent and location of injury and (3) clinical and measured venous hypertension. Venous ligation in clinically stable patients did not increase the need for fasciotomy or amputation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Sixty-nine limbs with infrapopliteal arterial injuries were evaluated in 68 patients. Thirty-five (50%) cases were complicated by acute limb-threatening ischemia. Management consisted of revascularization (26 limbs), ligation (15 limbs), fasciotomy only (2 limbs), observation (18 limbs), and primary amputation (8 limbs). Penetrating injuries (n = 35) had a 33% incidence of ischemia and a reduced frequency of associated injury. One delayed amputation (3%) was required. In contrast, blunt injuries (n = 34) had a 68% incidence of ischemia and a greater frequency of associated injury. There were 20 amputations in the blunt group, including eight primary amputations performed in limbs with profound ischemia, complex open fractures, severe soft-tissue damage, and neural injury. Observation or ligation of single arterial injuries resulted in no early amputations. Associated local injuries in both groups included fracture or ligamentous disruption (64%), severe soft-tissue damage (32%), and nerve dysfunction (36%). In both groups, 15 of 35 ischemic limbs were salvaged by prompt revascularization (11 penetrating and four blunt injuries). Aggressive revascularization with autogenous repair or bypass is recommended for management of penetrating trauma. Though a good outcome will be achieved in some patients with combined blunt trauma and infrapopliteal arterial injury, the probability of delayed amputation and prolonged disability must be consciously integrated into the decision to pursue limb salvage. The prognosis for blunt injury complicated by arterial ischemia is poor; thus the severity of associated local and remote injuries will affect the results of revascularization program.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of patients with penetrating extremity trauma in proximity to major arteries as well as the nonoperative treatment of clinically occult arterial injuries remain controversial. Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) has recently been advocated in this setting. We therefore studied experimentally induced arterial injuries in dogs to correlate the natural history, duplex findings, and histopathologic condition of different injuries and to help define criteria for operation. Fifty-two canine femoral and carotid arteries were randomized to have surgically created intimal flaps (n = 15), crush injuries (n = 15), or lacerations (n = 15) or to be controls (n = 7). An experienced sonographer, blinded to the presence or type of injury, evaluated the vessels every 10 days for 1 month. Histopathologic study was performed 1 month after injury when the arteries were retrieved. The sensitivity (96.5%), specificity (86.4%), and accuracy (95.1%) of DUS in evaluating arterial injuries at 1 month correlated well with histopathologic evaluation. All arteries subjected to crush injuries showed abnormal duplex findings. These findings correlated well with the histologic picture of severe injury (arterial wall thickness = 2.72 x +/- 0.23 x control; intramural hemorrhage, 93%; mural thrombus, 60%). DUS and histologic study revealed healing of intimal flaps in 27% of the arteries. Other intimal flaps deteriorated (stenoses, 47%; dilation, 13%; occlusion, 13%). Most lacerations (86%) revealed duplex evidence of healing within 10 days of injury. This was confirmed by histologic study at 1 month in 73% of lacerated arteries. This study confirms the accuracy of DUS in diagnosing various arterial injuries and shows that the natural history of these injuries varies with the mechanism of injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Upper extremity ischemia related to the construction of a chronic angioaccess is a serious and occasionally devastating complication. Fourteen patients with end-stage renal disease (mean age 58 +/- 18 years, 13 with diabetes, 10 female) had ischemia after construction of an angioaccess. Twelve patients had a polytetrafluoroethylene brachioaxillary bridge arteriovenous fistula (BAVF), one patient had a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and one patient had a brachiocephalic AVF. All patients had severe ischemia and five of them had established gangrenous changes. Symptoms appeared immediately after construction of the access in 10 patients. The remaining four patients had late onset of ischemia. The technique used for revascularization in all of these patients consisted of ligating the artery just distal to the takeoff of the AVF or BAVF and establishing an arterial bypass from a point proximal to the AVF or BAVF inflow to a point distal to the ligature. Bypass grafts consisted of saphenous vein in 13 cases and polytetrafluoroethylene in one case. Thirteen patients had a complete recovery, including healing of gangrenous lesions. One patient with severe gangrene of the hand at the time of revascularization required forearm amputation 13 months later because of progressive occlusive arterial disease. All AVFs were patent at 1 year. The 1-year patency rate for the BAVFs was 81.7%. All arterial bypasses were patent at 1 year. It is concluded that this technique offers consistent and durable hemodynamic and clinical improvement in arms affected by access-induced ischemia, with minimal morbidity, and does not affect the longevity of the angioaccess.",

Infected grafts and patients with suprarenal aneurysms present at the time of the original graft were excluded. Twenty-one patients, 19 men and two women, were included. The original indication for surgery was aneurysm in 14 patients and occlusive disease in seven; the mean interval from initial surgery to presentation was 10 years (range, 3 to 23 years). Twelve lesions were anastomotic false aneurysms, and nine were true aneurysms beginning in the proximal juxta-anastomotic aorta. Fourteen patients had an asymptomatic abdominal mass. Seven patients had symptoms of acute expansion (three), rupture (three), or thrombosis (one). True aneurysm and symptomatic presentation were correlated with aneurysm as the original indication for surgery. Repair was accomplished by an interpositional graft in 13 and graft replacement in eight. Seven patients required suprarenal anastomosis or renal and visceral reconstruction. Five operative deaths (24%) occurred, including two of three patients with rupture (67%) and two of seven patients (28%) in the suprarenal group. The mortality rate for elective repair with an infrarenal anastomosis was 11%. Two additional late deaths occurred during the follow-up period.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of unilateral iliac occlusion remains controversial. We report our experience with femorofemoral bypass (FF) and iliofemoral bypass (IF). One hundred sixty-two FFs and 82 IFs were performed during a 25-year period. Demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. Operative indications included claudication in 32.1% of FFs and 19.5% of IFs, rest pain in 26.5% of FFs and 36.6% of IFs, ulcer in 8.0% of FFs and 3.7% of IFs, gangrene 13.6% of FFs and 23.2% of IFs, and acute thrombosis in 13.0% of FFs and 3.7% of IFs. Five-year primary and secondary patency rates for all FFs were 56.9% and 65.4% respectively. Those for all IFs were 74.9% and 79.2%. The primary patency rate of FF performed for chronic arterial occlusive disease was 73.3% at 3 years and 60.4% at 5 years and for IF it was 73.4% at 3 years. In the absence of prior arterial surgery in the groin, the primary patency rates of bypasses for chronic arterial occlusive disease were 78.3% for FF and 86.8% for IF at 4 years. Distal endarterectomy and acute ischemia adversely affected patency. The operative mortality rate was 6.2% for FF and 3.7% for IF. Eleven wound complications occurred in the FF group. Seven patients underwent graft removal without limb loss. One minor wound problem occurred in the IF group. Iliofemoral bypass avoids operation on an asymptomatic limb; FF avoids entry in the abdomen or retroperitoneum and can be performed under local anesthesia. In patients in whom either IF or FF is applicable, the choice between these two procedures should be individualized with these factors in mind.",

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic injuries of the groin are becoming more common after increasingly sophisticated vascular intervention. These injuries are accurately detected by duplex and color Doppler ultrasonography. Recent treatment of these lesions by ultrasound-guided compression repair (UGCR) has been described. During a 1-year period we identified 18 femoral artery injuries, including 17 pseudoaneurysms and one arteriovenous fistula. Three of the pseudoaneurysms thrombosed spontaneously before attempted treatment. The remaining 15 lesions underwent a trial of UGCR. Successful closure was accomplished in 10 patients (56%). Seven of these lesions were successfully treated during the initial session, and thrombosis was accomplished after repeat compression in three additional lesions. Three patients who were given anticoagulants had a failed UGCR, but their pseudoaneurysms thrombosed after administration of anticoagulants was discontinued. Two patients had failed UGCR and required operation. Seven (88%) of eight patients who were not given anticoagulants were successfully treated. In contrast only two (29%) of seven patients given therapeutic doses of anticoagulant medication were successfully treated by the technique. There was no statistical difference between mean pseudoaneurysm diameter, mean width and length of pseudoaneurysm neck, or depth of pseudoaneurysm neck from skin surface in patients in whom successful initial closure was achieved when compared with those patients in whom the initial attempt failed. UGCR is a safe, simple, noninvasive technique that can be used to treat many femoral artery injuries that traditionally were treated with surgery. The technique can be applied by any laboratory that has the necessary ultrasonography equipment and is currently the method of choice for treating uncomplicated iatrogenic femoral artery injuries at our institution.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery are among the top users of homologous blood transfusion (HBT). Awareness of the risks of disease transmission and immune system modulation from HBT has prompted us to find alternatives such as autologous predonation (APD) and intraoperative autotransfusion (IAT). However, these latter options are not appropriate for all patients. We reviewed our experience with 59 Jehovah's Witness patients who underwent 63 elective cardiovascular procedures without either HBT or APD to determine the safety of operation without these modalities and to develop revised maximum surgical blood-ordering schedule guidelines for cardiovascular surgery. Estimated blood loss averaged 870 ml, but one third to one half of losses were replaced by IAT. IAT was not needed in lower extremity bypass operations in which the estimated blood loss was less than 150 ml. Three of 59 patients died (5.1%), but only one died of operative bleeding complications. We conclude that (1) elective cardiovascular operations can be done safely without the use of either HBT or APD, (2) HBT is not necessary in leg bypass procedures, and (3) maximum surgical blood-ordering schedule guidelines for HBT in major cardiovascular operations can be reduced to near zero by the use of intraoperative autotransfusion and acceptance of a postoperative hemoglobin nadir of 7.0 gm/dl.",

    "abstract": "In a prospective, randomized trial 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and 6 mm human umbilical vein (HUV) were compared in above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafting. In claudicants a prosthetic graft was used intentionally, in limb-salvage cases only when autologous vein was insufficient. Ninety-six extremities were randomized (49 PTFE and 47 HUV). Operative indication was disabling claudication in 77 and limb salvage in 19 extremities. The two groups were comparable as to preoperative risk factors and operative and postoperative treatment. Median follow-up was 76 months (range 47 to 91 months), during which 23 patients died of nonrelated causes with functioning grafts. Thirty-eight grafts failed (33 because of occlusion and five for other reasons). At 6 years the primary patency rate was 38.7% in the PTFE group and 71.4% in the HUV group (p < 0.001). Corresponding rates for secondary patency at 6 years were 51.4% and 76.4% (p < 0.005).",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in magnetic resonance imaging techniques have made magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) a very useful adjunct to invasive angiography. Fifty-five limbs in 51 patients with occlusive peripheral vascular disease were studied with both MRA and contrast arteriography. The magnetic resonance and contrast arteriograms were read by radiologists and surgeons and separate interventional plans were based on each study. The MRA findings differed significantly from those of conventional arteriography in 26 limbs (48%). In every case MRA visualized all of the same vessels and hemodynamic stenoses seen on the contrast arteriogram. In 48% of the cases, however, MRA revealed additional findings. Thus the discrepancies in the two studies were always the result of the failure of the arteriogram to reveal all of the patent vessels seen on MRA. The additional information provided by MRA resulted in alteration of the interventional plan in 11 cases (22%). In nine cases (18%) target vessels suitable for use in a limb-salvage procedure were identified by MRA, although they had been missed by conventional arteriography. In all of these cases, intraoperative arteriograms confirmed the suitability of these vessels for use in technically successful bypass procedures. In two cases (4%) additional information provided by MRA identified a target runoff vessel for bypass grafting that proved to be a better alternative than the one that would have been chosen on the basis of contrast arteriography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
