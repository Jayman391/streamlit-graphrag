    "abstract": "This study investigates the natural history and optimal imaging modality of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers of the aorta.\nWe reviewed our experience with 29 penetrating ulcers in 18 patients. Computed tomography (17 patients), magnetic resonance imaging (nine patients), and aortography (five patients) were used for diagnosis and follow-up. Patients were typically elderly (average age 74 years) and had hypertension and coronary artery disease. Ulcers were most common in the distal descending thoracic aorta (31%) and were characterized by a discrete ulcer crater (100%) and thickened aortic wall (89%). Modes of presentation included chest or back pain in four patients, distal embolization in two patients, and abnormal chest radiography results in one; the remaining were incidental findings.\nFollow-up was available in ten patients with 17 ulcers from 1 to 7 years. Recurrent pain occurred in two patients, recurrent embolization occurred in one patient, and seven patients remained symptom free. Progression to saccular pseudoaneurysm occurred in five ulcers, and fusiform aneurysm occurred in two ulcers. Two ulcers were associated with an increase in aortic diameter, and nine ulcers did not change. There were no cases of aortic dissection or rupture in the follow-up period. There were no deaths and only one patient underwent resection.\nThe natural history of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers is one of progressive aortic enlargement, with saccular and fusiform aneurysms the result if follow-up is sufficient. Aortic dissection, aortic rupture, and embolization can also occur but are less common. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the primary imaging modality.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of and predictors for vascular complications in patients who required perioperative intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) support.\nData from 580 patients collected with a retrospective review were statistically analyzed with 25 perioperative parameters, and significant variables were evaluated with multivariate analysis. These data were also statistically compared with data from a 1983 study from our institution.\nVascular complications occurred in 72 patients (12.4%). The three aortic perforations were fatal. Ipsilateral leg ischemia occurred in 69 patients. Of these, ischemia was resolved in 82% of patients by IABP removal (21), thrombectomy (21), vascular repair (13), fasciotomy (2), or without intervention (2). Six patients died with the intraaortic balloon in place. Four patients required amputation for ischemia, but all survived.\nVascular complications were not predictive of operative death (p = 0.26). Risk analyses with 25 perioperative parameters revealed that history of peripheral vascular disease, female sex, history of smoking, and postoperative insertion were independent predictors of vascular complications. However, most risk for vascular complications cannot be explained by these factors because of a low R2 value. Compared with the results of our 1983 study, the incidence of IABP-related complications has not changed, but the severity of complications has decreased significantly, and IABP-induced death has decreased significantly.",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis of popliteal artery aneurysms can produce limb-threatening ischemia. In this setting we have found preoperative thrombolytic therapy to be beneficial.\nThirty-three patients with 54 popliteal artery aneurysms were studied (mean follow-up 62 months). Twenty-one patients (62%) had bilateral popliteal artery aneurysms, and 20 patients (61%) had extrapopliteal arterial aneurysms. Thirty-three (61%) aneurysms had symptoms of compression or ischemia, and 21 (39%) aneurysms had thrombosis. A trend toward thrombosis for larger aneurysms was noted (p < 0.068).\nForty-five aneurysms were treated with bypass grafting. Five-year graft patency and limb salvage rates were 71% and 90%, respectively. Factors favoring graft patency and limb salvage included presence of two- or three-vessel runoff compared with patients with single- or no-vessel runoff (p < 0.025 graft patency; p < 0.003 limb salvage) and presence of a patent aneurysm (p < 0.005 graft patency and limb salvage). Seven patients diagnosed with thrombosis of their aneurysm and all runoff vessels were treated with preoperative thrombolytic therapy. Complete clearing of thrombus from these arteries was achieved in six of these patients (and from two of these runoff vessels in the remaining patient). These patients had better graft patency (p < 0.005) and limb salvage (p < 0.01) than comparable patients treated with emergency operations. Six amputations were performed in the follow-up interval, none of which were performed in patients having undergone thrombolytic therapy.\nIt is concluded that popliteal aneurysms are managed best by elective repair of patent aneurysms with good runoff. In that difficult situation of the thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm associated with acute leg ischemia, thrombolytic therapy safely and effectively provides patients with a more favorable alternative than emergency surgery.",

Plaque thickness was correlated with a multivariate model of mean shear stress, maximum shear stress, and their interactive effects with other parameters in the model with a correlation coefficient of 0.6733, (p = 0.0048).\nThis is the first prospective, in vivo study with a pulsatile, hyperlipidemic model, which clearly demonstrates that low shear stress is associated with plaque formation.",

    "abstract": "Femorofemoral bypass (FFB) is used in selected patients when aortobifemoral bypass (AFB) is believed to be inappropriate because of high operative risk or predominantly unilateral iliac artery occlusive disease. We examined concurrent patients who underwent either FFB or AFB to better understand the appropriate use of FFB.\nThe characteristics and outcomes of patients who underwent FFB and AFB during 1986 to 1991 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Primary measures of outcome included patient survival, graft patency, limb salvage, and hemodynamic performance of FFB and AFB. Further analysis was performed after substratification for low versus high risk and claudication versus limb threat as the indication for surgery.\nFFB was performed in older patients with more medical comorbidities when compared with AFB. Long-term graft patency was inferior after FFB compared with AFB (60% vs 85% at 3 years, p < 0.01). However, both FFB and AFB achieved limb salvage in more than 85% of patients at 3 years. When patients at low risk undergoing nonemergency AFB were compared with patients at low risk who underwent FFB and who had no contraindication to AFB, FFB proved inferior to AFB as measured by graft patency (primary patency 61% vs 87% at 3 years, p < 0.03) and hemodynamic performance (predicted ankle-brachial index with perfect outflow 0.82 after FFB vs 1.03 after AFB). On the basis of a detailed analysis of patient and graft risk factors, we could not explain the inferior patency rate of FFB, although our analysis suggested that inadequate inflow may contribute.\nFFB is inferior to AFB as measured by patency and hemodynamic function. This inferior performance is independent of indications for FFB. AFB should remain the standard therapy for patients at low risk with iliac occlusive disease, but FFB provides adequate function and limb salvage in patients at high risk.",

Long-term graft patency was inferior after FFB compared with AFB (60% vs 85% at 3 years, p < 0.01). However, both FFB and AFB achieved limb salvage in more than 85% of patients at 3 years. When patients at low risk undergoing nonemergency AFB were compared with patients at low risk who underwent FFB and who had no contraindication to AFB, FFB proved inferior to AFB as measured by graft patency (primary patency 61% vs 87% at 3 years, p < 0.03) and hemodynamic performance (predicted ankle-brachial index with perfect outflow 0.82 after FFB vs 1.03 after AFB). On the basis of a detailed analysis of patient and graft risk factors, we could not explain the inferior patency rate of FFB, although our analysis suggested that inadequate inflow may contribute.",

    "abstract": "In a retrospective study the outcome of 70 carotid endarterectomies (CEA) in 68 patients with neurologically unstable conditions or anatomically compelling findings on carotid angiography was examined to more accurately identify patients who might benefit from CEA in this setting.\nOut of a total of 1734 CEAs performed from 1978 to 1992, five groups of patients were selected: group A, stroke in evolution with tight stenosis (n = 5); group C, crescendo transient ischemic attacks (CTIA) continuing despite heparin (n = 14); group D, CTIA (above criteria) ceasing with heparin (n = 21); and group E, anatomically compelling situation on carotid angiography (n = 13). Data collected included preoperative and postoperative Neurologic Event Severity Score (NESS), CHAT classification, arteriosclerosis risk factors, demographics, and long-term overall and transient ischemic attack/stroke-free survival rates.\nRisk factors and demographics were similar in all groups. By NESS criteria the conditions of 97.3% of patients in the neurologically unstable groups A to C were improved or stabilized after operation, with one deterioration (2.7%). All patients in group B either stabilized or improved. In group D, one patient's NESS deteriorated, resulting in 3.5% overall morbidity rate and no deaths for groups A to D. Follow-up showed an overall survival rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis equivalent to a matched control population, with 85% alive at 5 years. The cumulative TIA/stroke-free survival rate at 5 years was 75%.\nIn this retrospective series, CEA performed for compelling or unstable neurologic findings carried low morbidity and mortality rates. Early aggressive surgical therapy of neurologically unstable patients may be warranted because our results improved on the anticipated natural history of the conditions studied. Further clarification of proper patient selection is necessary before this principle can be applied broadly.",

    "abstract": "This is a report of the operative findings and results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) when the conventional arteriogram demonstrates an internal carotid artery with a high-grade origin stenosis and a small or poorly visualized distal extracranial segment with an apparent diameter of 2 mm or less.\nEighteen CEA were performed on 17 patients with this preoperative finding and patent common and external carotid arteries. The indications for CEA were transient ischemia in seven patients, completed minor stroke in five and amaurosis fugax in four patients. One patient had bilateral findings and global cerebral ischemic symptoms.\nAt CEA 16 internal carotid arteries had atherosclerotic very high-grade origin stenosis, and two had chronic occlusion. Ten of the 16 open arteries had true external diameters of 4 mm or more. Of these, seven were normal above the stenosis, two had a long, trailing intraluminal thrombus that was removed, and one had high-grade distal stenosis. Of the six arteries with true diameters of 3 mm or less (hypoplastic), two had a thick fibrotic wall. The carotid stump back pressure for the 16 open internal carotid arteries was 56 +/- 15 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). This was significantly higher than the 39 +/- 14 mm Hg back pressure measured in 1016 arteries without a string sign (p < 0.001). There was one 30-day postoperative death after a stroke. There was no systemic or neurologic morbidity. Post-CEA duplex scans demonstrated eight normal, five mildly stenotic, and five occluded internal carotid arteries. Two of the occlusions were found at CEA and the other three occluded arteries had low flow after CEA, two of which were hypoplastic and the other had a distal stenosis.\nPatients with symptoms with these findings on arteriograms should undergo CEA. However, the success of CEA in this setting depends on the internal carotid artery anatomy and disease, which is difficult to determine before CEA. Patients with a truly normal extracranial internal carotid artery have an excellent probability of a successful CEA, but this is not the case when the artery is small or fibrotic. Low internal carotid artery flow after a technically satisfactory CEA is a harbinger of thrombosis and should be managed by internal carotid artery ligation and external CEA.",

    "abstract": "Hemosuccus pancreaticus--blood entering the gastrointestinal tract through the pancreatic duct--is a rare and elusive form of gastrointestinal bleeding. The most common cause is a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm caused by acute or chronic inflammation of the pancreas. We report the case of an 86-year-old woman who had recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding from erosion of an aneurysm of the splenic artery into the pancreatic duct. The lack of associated symptoms, equivocal endoscopic findings, and the rarity of this entity resulted in a delay in diagnosis. Nonresective treatment by ligation of the splenic artery proximal and distal to the aneurysm prevented any additional bleeding. Postoperative technetium sulfur colloid scanning demonstrated normal perfusion of the spleen. Only 16 cases of hemosuccus pancreaticus from primary splenic artery disease have previously been reported in the English-language literature (15 primary aneurysms, one medial disruption without an aneurysm). In contrast to cases caused by inflammatory pseudoaneurysms, splenic artery-pancreatic duct fistulas caused by primary aneurysms of the splenic artery should be treated without pancreatic or splenic resection, either with surgery or by embolization. In elderly patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure source, the differential diagnosis should include the possibility of a ruptured aneurysm communicating with a viscus.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the long-term results of a randomized prospective study comparing primary versus saphenous vein patch (VP) closure after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nOne-hundred thirty-six patients undergoing 163 CEAs over a 46-month period were prospectively randomized to VP, or primary closure. Patients with internal carotid artery diameters less than 5 mm and those requiring complex CEAs underwent obligatory vein patch (OVP). Patients were monitored with duplex scanning every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months thereafter. All patients received aspirin.\nThere were three perioperative strokes (one in the primary group, two in the OVP group) and no perioperative deaths. Two perioperative revisions were performed within 30 days of the original CEA for residual disease. During a mean follow-up of 59 +/- 4 months, nine ipsilateral neurologic events have occurred, including two strokes and seven transient ischemic attacks. Sixteen patients had duplex evidence of recurrent stenosis, and one was associated with a stroke 36 months after CEA. Recurrence rates were similar in all groups (cumulative recurrence at 5 years: primary 7.8%, VP 14.3%, OVP 5.3%). Of the 136 patients (163 procedures), 72 (53%) (88 procedures) are alive and well, 16 (11.7%) (19 procedures) have been lost to follow-up, and 48 patients (35.3%) (56 procedures) have died. The cumulative stroke-free survival rate at 84 months was 71% for VP, 74% for OVP, and 60% for the primary group.\nThese results demonstrate that CEA is a durable procedure. The use of VP closure did not produce superior long-term results compared with the use of primary closure in this select group of patients.",

Two perioperative revisions were performed within 30 days of the original CEA for residual disease. During a mean follow-up of 59 +/- 4 months, nine ipsilateral neurologic events have occurred, including two strokes and seven transient ischemic attacks. Sixteen patients had duplex evidence of recurrent stenosis, and one was associated with a stroke 36 months after CEA. Recurrence rates were similar in all groups (cumulative recurrence at 5 years: primary 7.8%, VP 14.3%, OVP 5.3%). Of the 136 patients (163 procedures), 72 (53%) (88 procedures) are alive and well, 16 (11.7%) (19 procedures) have been lost to follow-up, and 48 patients (35.3%) (56 procedures) have died. The cumulative stroke-free survival rate at 84 months was 71% for VP, 74% for OVP, and 60% for the primary group.",

    "abstract": "This study uses an objective structured clinical examination to evaluate the performance and interpretation of the vascular physical examination by interns and medical students.\nA patient with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease findings was examined by 20 third-year students (M3), 23 physicians entering surgical internship (PGY1), and 7 individuals completing internship (PGY2). The test consisted of two sections: part A evaluated the individuals' ability to perform a pulse examination (data gathering); part B evaluated the interpretation of the physical examination findings (data interpretation). National Board of Medical Examiners Part II examination results were obtained for 84% of participants.\nAll groups performed poorly, with overall correct percent scores being 43% (M3), 39% (PGY1), and 62% (PGY2). PGY2s performed significantly better than M3s or PGY1s (p = 0.0002). No statistical difference was noted between M3 and PGY1 scores. Overall, data gathering skills were significantly better than data interpretation skills (51% vs 37%, p = 0.0001). National Board of Medical Examiners Part II scores did not vary substantially among groups.\nInterns and medical students demonstrated considerable inaccuracy in both data gathering and data interpretation. A modest improvement was observed in individuals tested at the end of the internship year. This study suggests that increased attention should be directed toward instructing surgical residents and students how to perform an accurate peripheral vascular physical examination and how to interpret its significance.",

    "abstract": "The durability of renal preservation after surgical intervention has not been well defined, particularly in patients with associated aortic disease. A review of all patients at the Emory University Hospital with renal insufficiency (creatinine level > or = 1.8) and concomitant atherosclerotic aortic and renovascular disease was undertaken.\nFifty patients underwent both renal revascularization (71 kidneys) and the repair of aneurysmal or symptomatic aortic occlusive disease between 1982 and 1992. Hypertension was present in 96% of patients and diabetes was present in 10%. The preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) was 25.18 +/- 8.29 ml/min (creatinine level 3.1 +/- 1.5 mg/dl). Operative management included bilateral renal artery repair (n = 21), unilateral repair alone (n = 17), and unilateral repair with contralateral nephrectomy (n = 12). The relative percent change in the postoperative EGFR (> or = 7 days after operation) increased by at least 20% in 42% of the patients, had decreased by 20% or more in only 4%, and was otherwise categorized as unchanged in the remaining 54% of the study group.\nThe 30-day operative mortality rate was 2.0% (1 of 50). Forty-five of the surviving 49 patients (91.8%) were available for follow-up (median 49 months). During this period nine patients (18.4%) eventually required dialysis, four within 6 months of operation, and 19 patients died. Neither subgroup experienced a retrieval of renal function after operation. Five-year survival rate was 61%, and a trend was noted between the risk of death and the relative change in EGFR after operation (p = 0.13). The likelihood of eventually requiring long-term dialysis was highest among those patients with low preoperative functional renal reserve as measured by preoperative creatinine level of 3 mg/dl or greater (p < 0.0001), or preoperative EGFR less than 20 ml/min (p = 0.0001). Blood pressure was cured or improved in 50% at late follow-up.\nEarly improvement of renal function may be observed in nearly one half of patients subjected to combined aortic and renal revascularization. Nonetheless, renal preservation may not be sustainable in patients with compromised preoperative function. Intervention before marked functional decline remains the best option for minimizing the risk of eventual dialysis.",

    "abstract": "The approach to cardiac risk stratification of patients undergoing vascular surgery continues to be controversial. The success of algorithms that use clinical risk factors to determine cardiac risk have been inconsistent. Dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy (DMS) has been accepted as a sensitive, noninvasive approach to risk stratification with excellent negative predictive value. Low positive predictive value (PPV) of abnormal DMS scans is a shortcoming that contributes to extensive preoperative cardiac evaluation and intervention with associated morbidity, mortality, and cost in most patients who undergo uncomplicated vascular procedures, regardless of DMS results.\nOver 6 years, 237 patients underwent DMS before surgical management of infrarenal aortic aneurysm, aortoiliac, or infrainguinal occlusive disease. The value of multiple clinical factors and DMS were assessed retrospectively for the prediction of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI), heart-related death, or preoperative selection for myocardial revascularization. Only congestive heart failure and two or more reversible defects on DMS were statistically significant on logistic regression analysis.\nThe PPV of DMS was 19% for all patients with reversible defects, 12% for patients with one reversible defect, and 36.7% for patients with two or more reversible defects. The rates of cardiac death and MI were 1.3% and 5.9%, respectively. Perioperative echocardiography revealed unchanged postinfarction ejection fraction in most patients who experienced MI. Cost-effectiveness of DMS screening was evaluated.\nThe costs per MI and cardiac death averted suggest a decline in cost-effectiveness of screening with DMS over time, assuming improving cardioprotective strategies of patient care. Clinical risk factors were minimally useful in the prediction of perioperative MI, heart-related death, or need for myocardial revascularization. The PPV of DMS is low, and the majority of MIs may be clinically insignificant. The cost-effectiveness of cardiac screening with DMS may not be justifiable given current trends of health care reform.",

    "abstract": "Because of the scarcity of large series in the literature, our experience with surgery for aberrant subclavian arteries (aSA) in adults was reviewed.\nDuring the last 16 years we have surgically treated 33 adult patients with aSA. Twenty-eight patients had a left-sided aortic arch with a right aSA whereas five had a right-sided aortic arch with a left aSA. Eleven patients (group 1) had dysphagia caused by esophageal compression by a nonaneurysmal aSA; five patients (group 2) had ischemic symptoms caused by occlusive disease of a nonaneurysmal aSA; 10 patients (group 3) had aneurysms of the aSA with or without symptoms caused by esophageal compression or arterial thromboembolism; and seven patients (group 4) had an aSA arising from a diseased (usually aneurysmal) thoracic aorta. In all cases the divided aSA was revascularized, most often by direct transposition into the ipsilateral common carotid artery. Nine of the 16 patients in groups 1 and 2 underwent operation with a cervical approach alone. In the remaining seven, the cervical approach was combined with a median sternotomy (six cases) or a left thoracotomy (one case). In the 17 patients in groups 3 and 4, either a cervical approach (two cases), a median sternotomy (four cases), or a two-staged approach combining a supraclavicular incision on the side of the aSA with a posterolateral thoracotomy on the side of the aortic arch (11 cases) was used. Aortic cross-clamping was required in 12 of these patients to perform the transaortic closure of the origin of the aSA with patch angioplasty (three cases), or prosthetic replacement of the descending thoracic aorta (nine cases). Cardiopulmonary bypass was used in six patients (including three with hypothermic circulatory arrest).\nFour patients, all in groups 3 and 4, died after operation: two of multiorgan failure, one of heart failure, and one of esophageal rupture. Satisfactory clinical and anatomic results were obtained in the remaining 29 patients.\nThe surgical approach to aSA must be flexible and adapted to the anatomic conditions found. We recommend routine reconstruction of the aSA to avoid ischemic complications in the vertebrobasilar territory or upper extremity. Provision should be made for cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with aneurysm of aSA or associated aortic aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia is a leading cause of restenosis after vascular procedures. Recent findings showed that smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration from the media into the neointima is a critical step in the development of the hemodynamically compromising neointimal lesion. Moreover, integrins are believed to play a role in SMC motility. Therefore we studied the role of one ubiquitous integrin, alpha V beta 3, in SMC migration.\nTranswell assay was used to study in vitro migration of human and rabbit SMCs after stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). A neutralizing monoclonal antibody to alpha V beta 3, LM609, and a specific arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) antagonist, GpenGRGDSPCA, were used in the migration assay to inhibit alpha V beta 3-mediated SMC migration. In addition, GpenGRGDSPCA was administered locally to rabbit carotid artery after balloon angioplasty to determine the effect of blocking alpha V beta 3 on neointimal hyperplasia.\nWe showed that PDGF-induced human SMC migration is mediated by the alpha V beta 3 integrin by use of LM609 to inhibit migration and that SMC migration is RGD dependent by use of GpenGRGDSPCA to inhibit migration. We have also inhibited rabbit SMC migration with GpenGRGDSPCA to demonstrate the cross-species preservation of the RGD peptide sequence in SMC mortality. Finally, when we administered GpenGRGDSPCA locally to rabbit carotid artery after balloon angioplasty, there was a statistically significant reduction in neointimal lesion formation compared with arteries administered an inactive peptide or saline solution.\nWe have demonstrated the important role of the alpha V beta 3 integrin in SMC migration in vitro and in neointimal hyperplasia in vivo.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate changes in venous hemodynamics that occur in normal, symptom-free male and female volunteers, as a consequence of daily activity.\nEach leg of 25 symptom-free volunteers was prospectively studied twice in the early morning and twice in the late afternoon on 2 days. Air plethysmography was used to evaluate venous volumes, venous valvular function, calf muscle pump function, and the noninvasive equivalent of ambulatory venous pressure.\nThere was significant change in venous valvular function (venous filling index) indicating progressive insufficiency in the late afternoon compared with the results of the morning studies (p = 0.039). This was demonstrated by a shortened venous filling time (p = 0.033) but not a change in venous volume (p = 0.794). Calf muscle pump function and ambulatory venous pressures remained constant. Although there were significant leg volume and ejection volume differences at baseline in male volunteers compared with female volunteers, no gender differences were evident as a result of daily activity. Five of 25 (20%) volunteers and seven of 50 (14%) extremities had normal venous refill times and venous function index in the morning, which became abnormal in the afternoon, indicating deterioration of venous valve function.\nVenous hemodynamic changes occur normally as a consequence of daily activity and seem to result from valvular dysfunction. This occurs in men and women and can alter diagnostic conclusions in 20% of otherwise normal patients. These findings have important implications for venous testing and accurate patient evaluation. However, extrapolation of these data to patients with established venous disease should not be made.",

    "abstract": "A venous thrombosis animal model demonstrated similarities between intimal hyperplasia and thrombus organization. This has prompted the evaluation of a hypothesis that intimal hyperplasia may be the mechanism for thrombus organization in veins with normal pressure.\nThrombi were produced in surgically exposed jugular veins of anesthetized, 18 to 20 kg pigs. Thrombosis was induced by a combination of devascularization, electric injury produced by a low amperage, direct current, and permanent partial ligation (50% diameter reduction). Vein segments were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, and 60 days and histologically examined for fibrin, red blood cells, platelets, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, elastic fibers, and collagen deposits.\nForty vein segments in 20 pigs were evaluated. Luminal thrombi with thickened walls developed in all specimens. All luminal thrombi demonstrated partial spontaneous thrombolysis over the period of observation. Intimal thickening consisting primarily of smooth muscle cells by day 2 was apparent and progressed until about 2 weeks, when collagen deposits became prominent within the neointima. The neointima frequently comprised half the cross-sectional area of the veins. Endothelial cells were present in the intima as single cells or as lining for clefts formed within the thickened intima.\nSmooth muscle cell proliferation with collagen deposition characteristic of intimal hyperplasia seemed to be the mechanism of thrombus organization in the experimental thrombosis model used in this study in which extensive stimulation was used to produce thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is a focal arterial problem that still eludes successful therapy. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the acute treatment of experimental IH with light to activate an otherwise biologically inert photosensitizer. The purpose of this study was to determine the acute and long-term effects of PDT inhibition of IH on the artery wall.\nSegmental IH was induced by balloon injury localized to the cervical common carotid artery of 33 rats. The photosensitizer chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (5 mg/kg) for the experimental group or saline solution for the control group was administered intravenously. Twenty-four hours later, all instrumented portions of arteries were irradiated at 675 nm to induce cytotoxic injury in the PDT-treated arteries as compared with laser only-treated arteries for controls. Animals were killed at 1, 2, 4, and 16 weeks.\nThere were no untoward side effects in either group. All PDT-treated arteries were devoid of smooth muscle or inflammatory cells in the treated media. There was no evidence of arterial degeneration of PDT-treated arteries. Only three arteries in the PDT group developed IH, whereas it was universal in all controls. In control arteries, immunocytochemistry with bromodeoxyuridine revealed maximal intimal and medial cell proliferation at 1 week, and morphometric analysis demonstrated a maximal IH at 2 weeks. Immunocytochemistry staining for smooth muscle cell actin was positive for the IH in control and when present in PDT-treated arteries, whereas the adventitia of PDT-treated arteries were positive after 2 weeks. Electron microscopy demonstrated early myofibroblast migration to the adventitia, and at 16 weeks occasional myofibroblasts were noted in the media of PDT-treated arteries. There was complete reendothelial cell covering of the intima by 4 weeks.\nThese in vivo data demonstrate that PDT is an effective local method for the treatment of experimental IH. There is no evidence of significant recurrence of IH or arterial degeneration. Further studies with PDT may provide novel approaches to the understanding and treatment of arterial IH.",

    "abstract": "A relative deficiency of plasminogen within the thrombus may be the rate limiting factor in clot lysis.\nTo investigate this hypothesis, we used an in vitro perfusion system and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft segments filled with radiolabeled human thrombus. Three groups of five perfusions were compared: (1) urokinase infusion (333 IU/min) into clots laced with buffer, (2) urokinase infusion (333 IU/min) into clots laced with plasminogen (44 CU), and (3) control, D5W infusion into clots laced with buffer. Two end points were measured over time: the amount of lysed thrombus and the flow through the graft.\nUrokinase infusion resulted in augmented flow through the graft when compared with control (p < 0.05). Lacing with plasminogen resulted in more rapid restoration of flow when compared with urokinase infusion alone (p < 0.05). Similarly, the rate of clot dissolution was significantly greater in plasminogen-laced thrombi (p < 0.05) when compared with the control and urokinase groups. Embolization of particles of thrombus was uniformly observed in the urokinase group, resulting in a temporary decrease in flow through the thrombosed graft. This event characteristically occurred after 60 minutes of infusion but was never seen in the urokinase/plasminogen treatment group.\nThese results suggest that plasminogen supplementation of urokinase thrombolysis may result in significant clinical benefits with respect to the rate of clot lysis and the uniformity of clot dissolution with a lower likelihood of secondary embolization.",

    "abstract": "Few data are available on long-term follow-up of arterial segments subjected to thrombolysis. We reviewed all cases of vascular occlusion treated with urokinase to identify early success and determine the influence of postlysis intervention and the nature of the thrombosed segment (i.e., artery vs graft) on long-term patency.\nData on 134 cases (58 arteries, 76 grafts) treated with high-dose urokinase infusion in the lower limbs over a 7-year period were analyzed. Limbs were divided into five groups on the basis of therapy after lytic infusion to determine long-term efficacy: group I, success with no additional therapy; group II, percutaneous angioplasty alone; group III, limited surgical procedure (operative angioplasty, jump graft); group IV, extensive procedure (new bypass); and group V, revascularization after lytic failure. Long-term results were assessed by life-table analysis and groups compared by log-rank test (Mantel-Haenszel).\nInitial patency was established in 87 (64.9%) of 134 cases with 5 deaths (3.7%), 11 amputations (8.2%), and 16 complications (11.9%). Follow-up was available in 68.6% of cases for a mean of 10.9 months. No difference was seen between grafts and native arteries. Patency was analyzed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The 24-month patency rate after lysis alone (group I-25.9%) was inferior (p < 0.05) to results after lysis and any subsequent intervention (groups II, III, and IV). The type of intervention did not influence subsequent patency. Twenty-four-month patency of procedures performed after failed thrombolysis (group V, 41.4%) was not different from those after successful lysis (groups I to IV). Twenty-four-month patency in groups II and III (minor interventions, 62.9%) was not significantly different from that of groups IV and V (major interventions, 53.2%) (p > 0.25).\nOperative intervention is required to produce long-term arterial patency, even after successful thrombolysis. No statistically significant benefit of thrombolysis on vascular patency was seen in our series.",

Twelve bypasses were composed of a single arm vein segment, and 30 were composite vein bypasses. Bypasses were evaluated with CDS and ankle-brachial indexes before the patients were discharged from the hospital, at 1 month, and then every 3 months during the first year; every 6 months during the second year; and annually thereafter. The median follow-up period was 17 months, and the median number of scans performed per bypass was seven. Each examination consisted of a scan of the entire bypass with velocity measurements taken routinely at the proximal and distal anastomoses and at a proximal and distal bypass segment in addition to any high-velocity area identified on the CDS. Peak systolic velocity greater than three times that of an adjacent graft segment or peak systolic velocity less than 45 cm/sec throughout the vein conduit were indications for arteriography.\nThirteen arteriograms were performed because of abnormal duplex findings on surveillance. Extension or interposition vein grafts (9), vein patch angioplasty (1), or inflow procedures (3) were used to maintain secondary patency. The 24-month primary and secondary patency rates were 46% and 85%, respectively. Three patients required amputation of a major extremity.\nArm veins are satisfactory conduits for lower extremity revascularization. However, preocclusive lesions that require correction are commonly found on surveillance, especially when composite bypasses are required. Vein bypass surveillance with CDS allows identification and appropriate correction of preocclusive lesions.",

    "abstract": "The optimal treatment of patients with severe lower extremity ischemia after multiple failed prior bypasses is unclear. It is presently unknown whether failure of attempted revascularization in these patients is so likely that such operation should not be elected. We have maintained an aggressive surgical policy of repeated revascularization regardless of prior failures. A review of our clinical experience with this difficult patient group was performed to determine the results of this policy.\nFrom 1980 to 1992, 85 revascularization procedures were performed in 81 patients with lower extremity ischemia after failure of two or more prior infrainguinal bypasses in the same leg. All patients were prospectively entered and monitored in our vascular registry. Seventy-two operations were the third procedure, six operations were the fourth procedure, and seven operations were the fifth procedure on the same extremity. Twenty-six of the 85 procedures (30%) were revisions of failing grafts discovered by routine surveillance methods, whereas 59 were replacements of thrombosed grafts. Autogenous reconstruction was used in 67 procedures (79%), and prosthetic reconstruction was used in 18 procedures (21%). The distal anastomosis was to the popliteal artery in 19 patients and infrapopliteal artery in 66.\nMean time to failure of the first leg bypass was 24 months and 4.9 months for the second bypass. Detailed hematologic screening revealed identifiable hypercoagulable disorders in nine (15%) of 59 patients screened after 1987. All nine had anticardiolipin antibodies. The operative mortality rate was 4%. Mean follow-up after the most recent operation was 17 months. The primary patency rate at 4 years was 79.8%. The limb salvage rate was 69.6% at 4 years.\nThese results indicate that limb revascularization after two or more failed leg bypasses results in low operative mortality rates and surprisingly good primary patency and limb salvage rates at 4 years. The patient survival rate through 4 years is unexpectedly high. In our opinion these results justify an aggressive policy of limb vascularization after multiple failed prior bypasses.",

    "abstract": "Serial monitoring of vein graft peak systolic flow velocity (PSFV) has been endorsed as a technique for vein graft surveillance with low values (< 45 cm/sec) considered a marker for impending graft failure. Optimal application of this method requires an understanding of the factors affecting PSFV in normal grafts. A prospective evaluation of 46 consecutive elective infrainguinal vein grafts (6 popliteal/29 tibial/11 pedal) was undertaken to assess the major determinants of PSFV.\nFactors recorded for each patient included vein graft diameter (VGD), measured outflow resistance (MOR), conduit length, outflow level (popliteal/tibial/pedal), inflow level (femoral/popliteal), systolic blood pressure, cardiac ejection fraction, the presence of a patent plantar arch, and Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery resistance scoring. MOR was measured by occluding graft inflow and infusing saline solution through a proximal graft cannula at 60 cc/min while simultaneously recording the pressure at the distal anastomosis via a separate cannula. MOR was calculated by dividing the resultant pressure by the infusion rate. MORs were expressed in resistance units and were measured before and after the infusion of papaverine (MOR(PAP). PSFVs and VGDs were measured 4 to 6 cm from the distal anastomosis 3 weeks after surgery with duplex scanning (60 degree angle with midstream sample volume).\nPSFVs ranged from 22 to 148 cm/sec and averaged 83.4 +/- 4.8 cm/sec. Pedal bypass grafts had significantly lower PSFVs (64 +/- 10 vs 89.5 +/- 5 cm/sec, p = 0.02) and significantly higher MOR(PAP)s (0.86 +/- 0.15 vs 0.51 +/- 0.05 resistance units, p = 0.05) than bypasses to the popliteal/tibial level. When subjected to univariate analysis the factors correlating with PSFV were MOR (r = -0.59, p = 0.0001), MOR(PAP) (r = -0.69, p = 0.0001) VGD (r = -0.31, p = 0.06), the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery score (r = -0.35, p = 0.04), inflow level (r = -0.47, p = 0.002), and outflow level (r = -0.35, p = 0.03). When subjected to multiple regression analysis, only MOR(PAP) (r2 = 0.51, p = 0.001) and VGD (r2 = 0.14, p = 0.001) contributed significantly to the overall model (r2 = 0.65, p = 0.0001) with MOR(PAP)) eliminating the effect of the other variables. The multiple regression model predicts PSFV as follows: PSFV = 176 + VGD(mm) (-11.7) + MOR(PAP)) (-63.4).\nClinically successful and hemodynamically normal vein grafts have widely variable, yet predictable flow characteristics that are influenced primarily by outflow resistance and VGD. This wide variability suggests that no single lower threshold value for PSFV is universally applicable indentifying all grafts at risk for failure. Detection of focal areas of flow acceleration within the graft may be more accurate in identifying grafts at risk for failure.",

    "abstract": "Although the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in patients with peripheral arterial disease is in the range of 30% to 40%, the role of renal revascularization in patients without severe hypertension or kidney failure is controversial. Duplex scanning is a noninvasive technique that is ideally suited for screening and follow-up of renal artery disease. The purpose of this study was to document the natural history of renal artery stenosis in patients who were not candidates for immediate renal revascularization.\nEighty-four patients with at least one abnormal renal artery detected by duplex scanning were recruited from patients being screened for renal artery stenosis. Of the 168 renal artery/kidney sides, 29 were excluded (15 prior interventions, 6 nondiagnostic duplex scans, 8 presumed nonatherosclerotic lesions), leaving 80 patients with 139 sides for the follow-up protocol. Renal arteries were classified as normal, less than 60% stenosis, 60% or greater stenosis, or occluded by use of previously validated criteria.\nThe study group included 36 men and 44 women with a mean age of 66 years who were monitored for a mean interval of 12.7 months. The initial status of the 139 renal arteries was normal in 36, less than 60% stenosis in 35, 60% or greater stenosis in 63, and occluded in 5. Although none of the initially normal renal arteries showed disease progression, the cumulative incidence of progression from less than 60% to 60% or greater renal artery stenosis was 23% +/- 9% at 1 year and 42% +/- 14% at 2 years. All four renal arteries that progressed to occlusion had 60% or greater stenoses at the initial visit, and for those sides with a 60% or greater stenosis, the cumulative incidence of progression to occlusion was 5% +/- 3% at 1 year and 11% +/- 6% at 2 years. The mean decrease in kidney length associated with progression of renal artery stenosis to occlusion was 1.8 cm.\nProgression of renal artery stenosis, as defined in this study, occurs at a rate of approximately 20% per year. Progression to occlusion is associated with a marked decrease in kidney length. Whether this natural history can be improved by earlier intervention for renal artery stenosis remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "This report summarizes our experience with the use of cerebral spinal fluid drainage (CSFD) and naloxone for prevention of postoperative neurologic deficit (paraplegia or paraparesis).\nWe reviewed 110 consecutive patients with 86 thoracoabdominal aneurysms and 24 thoracic aneurysms. The status of 47 patients (43%) was acute (rupture or dissection), and the status of 52 (47%) was Crawford type I or II. None of the patients had intercostal artery reimplantation. There were two patient groups for analysis of neurologic deficit risk. Group A (61 patients) received naloxone and CSFD, and group B (49 patients) did not.\nOne deficit occurred in group A and 11 deficits occurred in group B (p = 0.001). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the variables acute status, Crawford type II, or group B classification were significant factors for deficit risk. Use of the same logistic regression analysis on the subgroup of 47 patients with acute aneurysms and 33 patients with Crawford type 2 aneurysms confirmed the protective effect of combined CSFD and naloxone (group A) and that clinical presentation and extent of aorta replaced are the primary risk factors for development of deficit. To test this conclusion we developed a highly predictive model (correlation coefficient 0.997 with 16 series of thoracoabdominal aneurysms) for neurologic deficit. We applied our data to this model. Group B had the predicted number of deficits, and group A had substantially fewer deficits than predicted.\nWe conclude that the combined use of CSFD and naloxone offers significant protection from neurologic deficits in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal and thoracic aortic replacement.",

By multiple logistic regression analysis, the variables acute status, Crawford type II, or group B classification were significant factors for deficit risk. Use of the same logistic regression analysis on the subgroup of 47 patients with acute aneurysms and 33 patients with Crawford type 2 aneurysms confirmed the protective effect of combined CSFD and naloxone (group A) and that clinical presentation and extent of aorta replaced are the primary risk factors for development of deficit. To test this conclusion we developed a highly predictive model (correlation coefficient 0.997 with 16 series of thoracoabdominal aneurysms) for neurologic deficit. We applied our data to this model. Group B had the predicted number of deficits, and group A had substantially fewer deficits than predicted.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilm infections of vascular prostheses are characterized by an absence of systemic sepsis, a fluid-filled cavity surrounding the graft, a draining sinus tract, and microorganisms that must be removed from the fabric prosthesis for bacterial culture.\nSince 1987 we have treated 20 infected grafts with prosthetic excision and in situ replacement in 14 men and 6 women. The time from initial graft implantation to diagnosis of graft infection ranged from 3 months to 14 years (mean 4.5 years). The original graft (Dacron-17, polytetrafluoroethylene-3) was an aortobifemoral in 14, axillofemoral femorofemoral in 3, iliofemoral in 2, and femoropopliteal in 1 patient. Presenting symptoms were groin false aneurysm with perigraft fluid in 10, inflammatory mass in 6, and sinus tract in 4. At surgery all unincorporated graft material and the perigraft capsule were excised from a point where the proximal graft was incorporated, including debridement of vessels at the distal anastomosis. Of the 14 aortobifemoral grafts, only the femoral limbs were excised at the initial presentation of biofilm infection. The conduit was replaced with an in situ polytetrafluoroethylene interposition graft, which was covered with a gracilis or sartorius muscle flap when possible.\nAll surgical sites healed, all grafts remained patent, and there was no limb loss. After ultrasonic oscillation of the explanted graft, bacterial cultures recovered coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species in 14, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus species in one, both species in three, with no growth from two specimens. During follow-up, two patients have had clinical involvement in the proximal intraabdominal portion of the graft that had not been previously resected. In all grafts, the in situ replacement graft remained well incorporated.\nIn situ graft replacement is effective treatment for biofilm infections of vascular prostheses. Because of the indolent nature of these infections, subsequent infection of previously uninvolved graft segments may be expected.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the cause of perioperative stroke after carotid endarterectomy.\nThe records of 2365 patients undergoing 3062 carotid endarterectomies from 1965 through 1991 were reviewed. Sixty-six (2.2%) operations were associated with a perioperative stroke. The mechanism of stroke was determined in 63 of 66 cases. Patient risk factors and surgeon-dependent factors were analyzed.\nMore than 20 different mechanisms of perioperative stroke were identified, but most could be grouped into broad categories of ischemia during carotid artery clamping (n = 10), postoperative thrombosis and embolism (n = 25), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 12), strokes from other mechanisms associated with the surgery (n = 8), and stroke unrelated to the reconstructed artery (n = 8). Dividing the operative experience approximately into thirds, during the years 1965 to 1979, 1980 to 1985, and 1986 to 1991 the perioperative stroke rates were 2.7%, 2.2%, and 1.5%, respectively. This, in part, is associated with a better selection of patients (more symptom free, fewer with neurologic deficits). There has been a notable decrease in perioperative stroke caused by ischemia during clamping and intracerebral hemorrhage, but postoperative thrombosis and embolism remain the major cause of neurologic complications.\nAlthough patient selection seems to play a role, most perioperative strokes were due to technical errors made during carotid endarterectomy or reconstruction and were preventable.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effect of primary closure (PC) versus expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch graft angioplasty (PGA) on the incidence of recurrent stenosis (> 50% lumen diameter narrowing) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 87 patients undergoing 100 consecutive CEA were prospectively randomized into two groups.\nForty-four patients underwent 51 PC, and 43 patients underwent 49 PGA. All patients were evaluated after operation by duplex scanning at 1.5, 12, 24, and 36 months. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics or operative indications for CEA between the two patient groups. Complete follow-up was achieved in 86% (75/87) of the patients during the 36-month surveillance period.\nThe perioperative permanent neurologic morbidity in the PC and PGA groups was noted to be 4% and 2%, respectively (PC = 2/51 vs PGA = 1/49, p = 0.58). Three additional reversible cerebral ischemic events occurred in the postoperative period (PC = 2/51 vs PGA = 1/49, p = 0.58). Other morbidity included immediate postoperative hemorrhage requiring reexploration (1/51) in the PC group and an infected expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch requiring removal and replacement with autogenous vein (1/49). Long-term follow-up detected a single patient with significant bilateral restenoses of his primarily closed carotid arteries. None of the patients in the PGA group had restenoses (PC = 2/51 vs 0/49, p = 0.50). In addition, no postoperative dilation of the common or internal carotid arteries or perioperative death was observed.\nIn patients undergoing CEA, these data demonstrate no significant difference in the perioperative morbidity or mortality between PC and PGA. Use of the patch did not engender patients to patch rupture or aneurysmal degeneration as previously described with vein patch angioplasty procedures. This series supports effective use of either technique to achieve minimal rates of restenosis.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic and neurologic functional effects of regional hypothermia induced by cold (4 degrees C) heparinized saline perfusion on spinal cord ischemia were evaluated in 35 rabbits.\nSpinal cord ischemia was induced for 20 minutes by infrarenal aortic occlusion in anesthetized animals. Regional spinal cord hypothermia was obtained by perfusing the lumbar arteries supplying the spinal cord through an infrarenal aortic catheter. The lumbar spinal cord was \"snap frozen\" in situ with liquid nitrogen and harvested immediately at the conclusion of the ischemic period or after 24 hours of normothermic reperfusion and neurologic observation. Spinal cord metabolic studies included determination of the energy charge and the intracellular concentrations of adenosine triphosphate, glucose, lactate, glutamate, and aspartate.\nPostoperative neurologic function was normal in all but one animal treated with hypothermia, while normothermic ischemia resulted in paralysis in all animals (p = 0.002). Spinal cord temperature during 20 minutes of ischemia and hypothermic perfusion decreased from 37.5 degrees +/- 0.43 degrees C to 22.8 degrees +/- 0.00 degrees C (p = 0.0001) compared to a fall in systemic temperature from 38.8 to 36.1 (p = 0.0001). Hypothermia reduced the decline in energy charge, adenosine triphosphate concentration and glucose concentration during ischemia but had no effect on markedly elevated levels of lactate acid. High-energy phosphates were restored after reperfusion in both normothermic and hypothermic animals and were not predictive of postoperative paraplegia. Intracellular glutamate and aspartate concentrations were unchanged during normothermic ischemia but decreased after reperfusion in all paralyzed animals. Intracellular glutamate and aspartate concentrations increased during hypothermic perfusion and remained elevated after reperfusion in animals with a normal or mildly abnormal neurologic examination result.\nWe conclude that spinal cord hypothermia induced by cold heparinized saline perfusion is a simple technique that prevents paraplegia after 20 minutes of ischemia and preserves intracellular concentrations of important metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil activation has been implicated in the pathophysiologic condition of ischemia-reperfusion injury, the formation of arterial aneurysms, the progression of myocardial ischemia, and the initiation of deep venous thrombosis. Activated neutrophils release cathepsin G, a serine protease, from their granules, which may cause platelet activation that leads to intravascular thrombosis, tissue infarction, and systemic release of the thrombogenic products of platelet granules. This study used flow cytometry to quantify the extent of cathepsin G-induced platelet activation and degranulation through changes in the expression of platelet surface glycoproteins.\nIncreasing concentrations of human neutrophil-derived cathepsin G were incubated with washed platelets or whole blood from healthy human donors. The platelet surface expression of glycoproteins, including P-selectin, a platelet membrane glycoprotein only expressed after platelet alpha granule release, were determined by quantifying the platelet binding of a panel of fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies. Results were compared with the effect of a maximal dose of thrombin, the most potent known platelet activator.\nIn a washed platelet system, cathepsin G increased platelet surface expression of P-selectin (an activation-dependent neutrophil binding site), the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex (fibrinogen receptor), and glycoprotein IV (thrombospondin receptor), and decreased surface expression of glycoprotein Ib (von Willebrand factor receptor) to an extent comparable to maximal thrombin. However, these effects were not observed in a whole blood system. Further experiments revealed that preexposure to plasma completely inhibited cathepsin G-induced washed platelet activation and degranulation. Prostacyclin treatment of washed platelets markedly inhibited cathepsin G-induced platelet activation.\nCathepsin G is a very potent platelet agonist and degranulator, comparable to maximal thrombin, which alters platelet surface glycoprotein expression for enhanced neutrophil binding and effective platelet aggregation. This study helps to elucidate a possible pathway through which neutrophils may directly activate platelets, leading to intravascular thrombosis, irreversible ischemia, and tissue death in cardiovascular disease states. Patients with diseased endothelium that is deficient in prostacyclin production may be particularly prone to the detrimental effects of neutrophil-derived cathepsin G platelet activation.",

    "abstract": "The existence of a confluently covering endothelium that is free of any thrombotic appositions can be proved 30 days after clinical implantation of an in vitro endothelialized expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The recipient of the mesosystemic H-graft was a 69-year-old man who had a thrombosed portal vein following pancreatitis. Autologous endothelial cells were obtained from the external jugular vein under local anesthesia, applying the in situ cannulation technique. After low-density plating, first-passage mass cultures of 1.22 x 10(6) endothelial cells were obtained 14 days after vein excision. After precoating was accomplished with fibrinolytically inhibited fibrin glue, a 10 mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft was confluently lined with the autologous endothelial cells at a seeding density of 1.2 x 10(5) cells/cm2. After a maturation period of an additional 9 days and the microbiologic exclusion of a possible infection, an 11 cm graft segment was implanted between the superior mesenteric vein and the inferior vena cava. In spite of a patent shunt the patient had a repeat bleeding episode, needed parenteral nutrition, and died of sepsis on day 30. Immediately after the graft had been taken out, specimens were processed by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy for the immunohistochemical proof of the endothelial nature of the surface-covering cell layer. The entire graft surface displayed a confluent cell lining that was free of any thrombotic appositions. A strongly positive stain result for both factor VIII-related antigen and the fixation-resistant CD34 molecule identified these cells as endothelial. No alpha-actin-positive cells could be detected. The underlying protein matrix was well preserved and unaltered in thickness and appearance, compared with preimplantation samples. None of the specimens showed any evidence of infection. This human demonstration of an intact endothelium on a patent venous prosthesis further establishes in vitro lining as a method that actually creates a persistent and functioning endothelium on a synthetic graft surface.",

    "abstract": "The creation of an endothelial coverage on prosthetic vascular surfaces may improve the performance of synthetic small diameter vascular grafts. In vitro lining with cultured autologous endothelial cells offers a confluent endothelium at the time of implantation.\nBetween June 1989 and December 1991, 49 patients who had no saphenous vein available entered the study. Indication for operation was disabling claudication in 37 patients and critical ischemia in 12 patients. With a random 1:2 assignment, 33 patients were admitted to the endothelialized group and 16 control patients received an untreated polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis. Cultured autologous endothelial cells from the external jugular vein were confluently lined onto polytetrafluoroethylene grafts precoated with fibrinolytically inhibited fibrin glue. The follow-up was based on angiography, platelet labeling studies with indium 111-labeled oxine, assessment of the ankle-brachial index, and duplex sonography.\nFirst-passage mass cultures of 16 million endothelial cells-required for the confluent lining of a 70 cm long 6 mm graft-were reached 25.1 +/- 11.2 days after vein excision. Growth failure occurred in 27.3%. After 32 months, the actuarial patency was 84.7% for endothelialized grafts and 55.4% for control grafts (p < 0.041 by Breslow test; p < 0.068 by Mantel-Cox test). The ankle-brachial index was continually diverging, reaching significantly lower values in the control group at 24 months (0.98 +/- 0.14 in the endothelialized group versus 0.70 +/- 0.12 in the control; p < 0.0023). The uptake of indium 111-labeled platelets--measured at 9 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months--was significantly lower in the endothelialized group during the entire observation period.",

Nineteen lesions were treated: 11 subclavian and eight innominate. Twenty-two stents were initially implanted.\nStent deployment was successful in all cases and immediately remedied the underlying cause of venous hypertension.

    "abstract": "Nonoperative therapeutic approaches to chronic venous ulceration, although effective, often require prolonged dressing care and immobilization with leg elevation. Results of skin grafting, perforator ligation, and valve interpositions and reconstructions improve results of ulcer healing but have not uniformly prevented ulcer recurrence. Our hypothesis is that reconstruction of chronic venous ulcers by excision of the diseased tissue bed and replacement with a free flap containing multiple competent microvenous valves and a normal tissue microcirculation will result in long-term cure of these debilitated patients.\nSix patients with chronic venous insufficiency and recurrent ulceration (class 3) underwent excision of ulcers and surrounding liposclerotic tissue beds and reconstruction with fasciocutaneous free flaps (two bilateral). Preoperative and postoperative photoplethysmography was used to assess venous refilling times. Duplex scanning was performed to assess deep venous reflux.\nThere were no flap failures. Photoplethysmographic venous refilling times measured on flaps demonstrated significant immediate and long-term increases from preoperative values (all results +3 by Society of Vascular Surgery outcome grading). Long-term maintenance of tissue integrity is shown by absence of recurrent ulceration and no evidence of recurrent tissue lipodermatosclerosis in all flaps at follow-up (8 months to 7.5 years; mean 24 months). No recurrent lipodermatosclerosis was seen on flap biopsy at 2 and 7 years. Separate cadaveric injection studies, including scanning electron microscopy, revealed numerous microvenous valves directed toward the draining pedicle in the flaps used for reconstruction.\nThis is the first comprehensive report providing combined laboratory and clinical evaluation, anatomic rationale, and long-term outcome of surgical rehabilitation of patients with chronic venous ulceration who have undergone microsurgical flap reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "A rat model was developed to investigate the effects of acute peripheral ischemia on the components of the fibrinolytic system.\nLaparotomy was performed and ischemia was introduced by total aortic clamping at a subrenal position. Control animals underwent sham laparotomy alone. Plasma and tissue samples were collected for analysis at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after operation.\nFunctional assays of rat plasma revealed a dramatic and transient increase in tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity within 30 minutes of the onset of ischemia. A simultaneous decline in plasminogen activator inhibitor activity was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis suggested this initial increase in tPA activity resulted primarily from the release of stored tPA from ischemic vascular tissues. Northern blot analysis revealed that both tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 messenger RNA levels were elevated at 60 to 120 minutes in well-perfused tissues distant from the ischemic insult.\nCollectively, these data demonstrate that acute peripheral ischemia results in a rapid and transient increase in plasma fibrinolytic activity, concomitant with the early release of stored tPA from ischemic vascular tissues. In addition, peripheral ischemia appears to stimulate both tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene expression in well-perfused tissues at later time points, consistent with the existence of humoral mediators.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of the Auth Rotablator, an atherectomy device recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for general use in treating peripheral arterial occlusive lesions.\nBetween August 1987 and December 1990, 72 patients from three medical centers (University of California, Los Angeles, Montefiore, and Stanford) underwent atherectomy with the Auth Rotablator in 79 limbs and 107 arteries: 2 iliac, 45 femoral, 29 popliteal, and 31 tibial. The average age among the 72 patients was 69 years (43 to 91 years), and 67% were men. Indications for atherectomy were claudication in 34 (43%), limb threat in 44 (56%), and asymptomatic in 1 (1%) case. Average ankle-brachial index was 0.47 (0 to 0.81). Average length of lesions was 9 cm (1 to 40 cm); 70 treated arterial segments were less than 10 cm and 37 were greater than 10 cm. All patients underwent arterial pulse examination, vascular laboratory Doppler measurement of ankle-brachial indexes, and arteriography before and after surgery and at follow-up intervals during a period of 15 to 41 months (mean 27 months).\nAngiographic success (residual lumen < 25% stenosis) was achieved in 70 (89%) of 79 limbs and 82 (77%) of 107 arteries: iliac 1 (50%) of 2, femoral 38 (84%) of 45, popliteal 24 (83%) of 29, and tibial 19 (61%) of 31. In-hospital clinical and hemodynamic success was achieved in 61 (77%) of 79 limbs. The cumulative primary patency rate was 47% at 6 months, 31% at 12 months, and 18.6% at 24 months. Complications included hemoglobinuria in 10 cases (13%), emboli in eight cases (10%), dissection in five cases (6%), perforation in three cases (4%), hematoma in four cases (5%), and infection in one case (1%). There were nine early thromboses (11%) and two device-related amputations (2.5%).\nPeripheral atherectomy with the Auth Rotablator currently has limited application because of frequent early thromboembolic complications and poor late patency rates. Atherectomy is not generally recommended for treating peripheral arterial occlusive lesions until these problems with early thromboemboli, occlusions, and late restenoses are solved.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether a transthrombus bolus of t-PA before low-dose infusion shortens lysis time.\nTwenty-three patients with peripheral arterial or bypass graft occlusion were treated with an initial bolus of 20 mg t-PA followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/hr.\nAngiographic lysis was achieved in 16 patients (70%) with a mean time to complete lysis of 14.4 +/- 7.9 hours. Two patients had reocclusion on days 1 and 3, respectively. There were three deaths within the first week of treatment, one from cerebral hemorrhage and two from myocardial infarction.

Of the seven unsuccessful cases, three patients subsequently underwent a femorodistal bypass, two were left with tolerable ischemic symptoms, and two required a major amputation. There were eight major bleeding complications (35%), four at or adjacent to the catheter entry site and four at a distance, including two cases of cerebral hemorrhage, one of which was fatal.\nTransthrombus bolus delivery of tissue plasminogen activator followed by a low-dose infusion shortens lysis time, but this technique appears to be associated with an increased risk of serious hemorrhage.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of an atheromatous plaque causes endothelial desquamation and intimal dissection with the consequent formation of a thrombogenic flow surface. In this study we investigated the hypothesis that platelet deposition after balloon angioplasty may be decreased by rapid restoration of the endothelial cell monolayer, achieved by transluminally seeding angioplasty sites with endothelial cells.\nBilateral external iliac angioplasty was performed in eight New Zealand white rabbits. One angioplasty site was isolated from the circulation and incubated with a supraconfluent endothelial cell suspension with a double balloon catheter; the contralateral angioplasty site was sham seeded with culture medium. The deposition of autologous indium 111-labeled platelets on the angioplasty sites was quantified 30 minutes after restoration of flow and was referenced to an undamaged segment of aorta that acted as a negative control.\nPlatelet deposition on the nonseeded angioplasty site (13.1 x 10(4) platelets/mm2) was significantly higher than on nondilated segments (3.4 x 10(4) platelets/mm2; p = 0.014). Restorationof endothelial cell coverage by endothelial seeding significantly reduced platelet deposition on dilated arterial segments to levels not significantly higher than in controls (3.6 x 10(4) platelets/mm2; p = 0.014).\nThese results illustrate that rapid reendothelialization of angioplasty sites decreases subsequent platelet deposition and may reduce the rate of acute arterial reocclusion complicating endovascular techniques.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we have reported that lipid peroxidation specific to oxygen free radical-mediated injury increased immediately after reperfusion of human liver allografts. However, in the human liver transplantation setting it was impossible to disassociate the contributions to lipid peroxidation caused by the warm and cold ischemic phases from those caused by reperfusion. Therefore we now have studied lipid peroxidation at reperfusion after supraceliac aortic cross-clamping in patients with normal livers.\nEthane, a noninvasive biomaker of lipid peroxidation, was measured in exhaled breath of patients before and during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta and at sequential time intervals after visceral reperfusion.\nApproximately a two-fold transient increase in the ethane level was observed at around 15 minutes after reperfusion in those patients whose aortas were cross-clamped for more than 18 minutes.\nThese results indicate that free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation occurs at reperfusion of warm ischemic viscera in the clinical setting of aortic repair. This observation supports the hypothesis that substantial lipid peroxidation occurs when tissues are subjected to cold or warm ischemia followed by reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic graft infection represents a most challenging complication to the vascular surgeon. Although expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts have an acceptable patency rate, especially in the large-diameter arterial location, bacterial contamination of this material usually requires surgical removal of the graft.\nWe compared the resistance of large-diameter ePTFE grafts and grafts constructed of small intestinal submucosa (SIS) to deliberate infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Eighteen dogs were divided into two equal groups, and the infrarenal aorta was replaced with either ePTFE or SIS graft material. One hundred million S. aureus organisms were deposited directly on the graft at the time of surgery, and the dogs were observed for 30 days.\nOne dog with an ePTFE graft died of hemorrhage from anastomosis site at 21 days. Of the remaining eight dogs with ePTFE grafts, four had positive culture results from the removed graft material, and all had histologic evidence for persistent infection. These dogs also had chronic fever, and the average white blood cell count at day 30 was 15,600/mm3. All nine dogs with SIS grafts had patent grafts, were afebrile after the first week, had an average white blood cell count of 11,500/mm3 at 30 days (p value = NS), had negative culture results, and had the histologic appearance of graft remodeling with collagen that was free of active inflammation.\nWe conclude that large-diameter arterial SIS grafts are more resistant to persistent infection with S. aureus than ePTFE grafts in this dog model of deliberate bacterial inoculation.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to clarify the role of hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) in the management of complex aortic aneurysms operated on through the left thoracotomy, our technique of HCA and outcome were reviewed.\nDuring a 21-month period, 15 (17%) of 87 aneurysms of the descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta were operated on by HCA. Eleven patients had chronic aortic dissections (four type A and seven type B), two patients had atherosclerotic aneurysms, and one each had congenital or infected postoperative aneurysms. The use of HCA was planned before surgery in 14 patients. Indications included proximal aortic disease in 12 patients, making either clamping of the transverse aortic arch unsafe (eight patients) or necessitating replacement of the arch with a graft (four patients). Preoperative decision to use HCA was made in two additional patients, one with a ruptured aneurysm and another patient for spinal cord and visceral protection because of anticipated prolonged ischemia as a result of reoperation. Intraoperative technical difficulties prompted the use of HCA in only one patient. Deep hypothermia (15 degrees to 24 degrees C) was induced through partial cardiopulmonary bypass. Left-sided heart venting was necessary in five patients. Aortic replacement was limited to the descending thoracic aorta in five patients, whereas it involved the thoracoabdominal aorta in 10 patients. Four patients had associated replacement of the aortic arch.\nThree patients died (one of a ruptured aneurysm) during surgery or early after surgery (two of bleeding and one of left ventricular failure). All other patients awoke neurologically intact, but one patient had delayed onset of paraplegia. Another patient died 4 days after surgery of rupture of the ascending aorta. Eleven patients were perioperative survivors without significant morbidity.\nHypothermic circulatory arrest is a valuable adjunct in the management of complex aortic aneurysms through left-sided thoracotomy. Its results warrant consideration of its selective use for spinal cord/visceral protection.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rejection of arterial allografts and xenografts results in arterial wall dilation and rupture, making them unsuitable for long-term arterial replacement in vascular surgery. In the arterial wall, as in other organs, the cells probably carry major antigenic determinants. Arterial wall cellular components can be removed by detergent treatment to produce a graftable matrix tube.\nWe compared the patency and macroscopic and microscopic morphologic changes that occurred in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-treated and untreated arterial isografts, allografts, and xenografts 2 months after implantation in rats. We quantified elastin, collagen, and nuclear density in the three layers of the graft wall (intima, media, and adventitia) by morphometric methods. The SDS treatment removed endothelial and smooth muscle cells and cells in the adventitia but preserved elastin and collagen extracellular matrix.\nAll arterial xenografts, whether SDS treated or untreated, were aneurysmal 2 months after grafting, with loss of the medial cellular and extracellular components. In allografts, SDS treatment prevented dilation, reduced adventitial inflammatory infiltration, and preserved medial elastin. The SDS-treated allografts had an evenly distributed, noninflammatory intimal thickening that was richer in elastin fibers than that in untreated allografts.\nThese results suggest an interspecies, but not an intraspecies, graft antigenicity of arterial extracellular matrix. The SDS treatment prevented chronic rejection of the arterial allograft and led to the proliferation of an elastin-rich and adapted intima.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate that modulation of plasma cholesterol concentrations affects prosthetic vascular graft anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH), aortic grafts were examined histologically and biochemically in 41 rabbits.\nTwenty-seven rabbits were fed standard rabbit diet, whereas 14 were fed cholesterol-supplemented diet to induce hypercholesterolemia.\nA smooth muscle cell proliferative response, similar to AIH in humans, was seen equally at the proximal and distal anastomoses. However, surface area and thickness of AIH were significantly greater in rabbits with hypercholesterolemia. Anastomotic tissue cholesterol concentrations were fifteenfold higher in rabbits with hypercholesterolemia than in rabbits with normal cholesterol concentrations and anastomotic cholesterol concentrations were fivefold higher than in the aorta away from the graft in rabbits with hypercholesterolemia. Preferential deposition of radioiodinated dilactitol tyramine coupled to low-density lipoproteins, but not albumin, was demonstrated in anastomotic areas and grafts of rabbits with normal cholesterol concentrations as well. Surface area and thickness of AIH correlated closely with plasma and tissue cholesterol concentrations.\nOxidized products of lipoproteins have been shown to stimulate production of growth factors that cause smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and synthetic function. It is likely they play an important part in prosthetic vascular graft AIH, similar to their role in atherogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Human aortic atherosclerosis is predominantly localized to the infrarenal aorta where flow is bidirectional and wall shear stress oscillates. Similar flow patterns have been related to carotid atherosclerosis. The thoracic aorta is usually spared, where flow and shear stress are unidirectional. We hypothesized that because heart rate and systemic blood pressure modulate flow velocity and shear stress oscillation, both these hemodynamic forces may enhance aortoiliac atherogenesis.\nEighteen male cynomolgus monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 6 months (mean serum cholesterol = 535 +/- 35 mg/dl). Heart rate was determined with 24-hour electrocardiographic telemetry at monthly intervals and blood pressure was measured by direct arterial cannulation. The product of mean heart rate and mean blood pressure was used to define hemodynamic stress for each animal. Atherosclerotic lesion formation at three standard thoracic aortic sites was quantitatively compared with lesion formation at five standard infrarenal aortoiliac locations with computer-assisted morphometry.\nThere was significantly more plaque in the aortoiliac segment than in the thoracic aorta (12.4% +/- 9.0% vs. 6.4% +/- 4.5% area stenosis, p = 0.02). No correlation was found between the degree of serum lipid elevations and lesion formation in either aortic location. Mean heart rate was 113 +/- 18 beats/min (87 to 163 beats/min) and mean blood pressure was 85 +/- 19 mm/Hg (62 to 130 mm Hg). Heart rate and blood pressure alone were not significantly related to lesion formation. A significant correlation was, however, found between hemodynamic stress and maximum lesion thickness (r = 0.47, p < 0.05) in the aortoiliac region but not in the thoracic aorta (r = 0.19, p > 0.10).\nThis study demonstrates that heart rate and blood pressure exert a mutually potentiating effect on aortoiliac atherosclerosis but not on thoracic aortic atherosclerosis. Regional differences in aortic atherosclerosis may therefore be attributable to the interaction between these hemodynamic forces and the local flow patterns specific to each aortic location. Additional investigation of these hemodynamic factors in relation to human aortic atherosclerosis is warranted.",

    "abstract": "To investigate local hemodynamics downstream of arterial stenoses, a perivascular five-element Doppler ultrasound transducer was used for registration of one-dimensional velocity profiles and estimation of Reynolds (turbulent) normal stresses downstream of smooth, graded stenoses on the abdominal aorta in six 90 kg pigs.\nBlood velocities were registered by a 10 MHz pulsed Doppler velocimeter that used a modified zero-crossing detector with an upper -3 dB cutoff frequency of 200 Hz. Signal analysis included ensemble averaging, turbulence analysis, and dimensional visualization of velocity profiles.\nVelocity profiles downstream of minor (< or = 40%) and moderate (40% to 65%) stenoses were skewed with the highest systolic velocities toward the anterior vessel wall and diastolic flow reversal occasionally present at the posterior vessel wall. Immediately downstream of severe (> or = 65%) stenoses a prominent poststenotic jet and systolic recirculation zones were present. Further downstream, vortices and eddies dominated the flow field. Reynolds normal stresses were highest at locations in the velocity field with high-velocity gradients corresponding to the parajet zone.\nThe present study demonstrated that pulsed Doppler ultrasonography can provide detailed and quantitative information of flow phenomena such as jetlike flow, vortices, and recirculation zones in a poststenotic flow field in the abdominal aorta.",

    "abstract": "Chronic deep venous insufficiency, usually secondary to the postthrombotic syndrome, is due to primary valve failure in approximately 15% of cases. In these cases surgical repair of the valvular mechanism may be indicated.\nFifty-two limbs in 42 patients were treated with superficial femoral vein valvuloplasty after appropriate investigation. Adjunctive operations on the superficial or perforating veins were performed on 49 limbs during the same hospital admission.\nOf the 27 patients who have completed one year of follow-up, 85% are free of reflux on duplex scanning and 68% have had normalization of venous refilling times. Of 11 limbs with venous ulceration followed up for more than 1 year, only one has had a recurrent ulcer (9%). In patients without ulceration the procedure has been successful in alleviating symptoms of venous insufficiency.\nWe conclude that the procedure, in conjunction with appropriate superficial venous operation, is effective in selected patients with deep vein reflux whose conditions remain uncontrolled by conservative measures. At 1 year, 85% of valvuloplasties in this series remained competent.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe the very long-term clinical, hemodynamic, and imaging results of venous valve reconstruction for reflux disease in patients with chronic venous insufficiency.\nThere were 51 extremities (48 patients) with follow-up of 4 to 21 years with a mean of 10.6 years. Clinical severity was graded as asymptomatic (class 0), mildly symptomatic (class 1), moderately symptomatic but without ulceration (class 2), or severely symptomatic with or without ulceration (class 3). Preoperative and postoperative evaluation consisted of history and physical examination, ascending venography (preoperative only), ambulatory venous pressures or photoplethysmography, and descending venography or duplex scanning.\nBefore surgery, 49 (96%) of 51 limbs demonstrated severe, class 3 disease, and two limbs were classified as class 2 disease. After venous valve reconstruction by either direct femoral vein valve repair, transposition, or transplantation, long-term clinical success of achieving a class 0 or 1 result (by life-table analysis) was 60% at 10 years. Thirty-three percent demonstrated a class 0 result in which the limbs were free from symptoms and had no need for long-term elastic support. After 6 years clinical results were stable and did not deteriorate. Incompetent perforators were identified in 31 cases and were treated selectively. Three disease patterns of chronic venous insufficiency were identified: primary valve insufficiency 43%, postthrombotic syndrome 31%, and a group consisting of both primary valve insufficiency of the superficial femoral vein and postthrombotic syndrome of the calf veins (primary valve insufficiency-postthrombotic syndrome) 26%. Ten-year cumulative clinical success was clearly superior in limbs with primary valve insufficiency corrected by valve repair (73%) as opposed to those with postthrombotic syndrome treated by either valve transposition or transplantation (43%) (p = 0.029). Clinical outcome correlated strongly with postoperative imaging results, and durability of valve repair was confirmed by demonstrating competence up to 16 years after the operation. Significant improvement in ambulatory venous pressure (mean percentage of pressure fall and refill time) was found in limbs with class 0 or 1 outcome; however, values did not reach \"normal\" levels in all cases. Recurrent ulcerations after the operation were attributed to failed reconstructions (10), incompetent profunda femoris veins (three), incompetent perforators (three), and concomitant lymphedema (one).\nThis report highlights a difference found in very long-term prognosis of surgical treatment of primary valve insufficiency as opposed to postthrombotic syndrome. Long-term elimination of symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency is achieved by valve repair for primary valve insufficiency beyond 10 years, whereas late results of treatment of postthrombotic syndrome in this study was accompanied by high recurrence rates and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Adequate exposure of the upper abdominal aorta and its branches is a necessary prelude to safe and durable reconstruction of this aortic segment. Although a variety of approaches to this exposure have been described, few outcome data are available to assess the benefits and limitations of the different exposure options. In this series we report the results of the transabdominal medial visceral rotation (MVR) approach to exposure of the paramesenteric and pararenal aorta.\nOne hundred eight operations were performed in 104 patients, representing 19.5% of all aortic reconstructions during a 5.5 year interval. Most patients had hypertension (n = 77, 71.3%) or a history of smoking (n = 83, 76.9%). Heart disease was present in one third of patients (n = 33) and a similar proportion had abnormal renal function (elevated creatinine level) before operation (n = 40, 37.0%). One third of patients (n = 34) had undergone previous aortic or aortic branch reconstruction. Eighty percent of procedures were elective (n = 87). Seventy-one patients (65.7%) required renal revascularization, usually for hypertension or elevated creatinine levels, whereas 37 patients (34.3%) underwent visceral reconstruction, most often for symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia. Only 22 patients required isolated infrarenal aortic repair. Most of the aortic lesions were aneurysmal (n = 42). Eighty percent of procedures (n = 88) required suprarenal or more proximal aortic clamping. The most frequently used reconstruction techniques were bypass (n = 39, 36.1%), endarterectomy (n = 18, 16.7%), or both (n = 23, 21.3%).\nThere were four intraoperative deaths (3.7%) and 15 postoperative deaths (13.9%). All intraoperative deaths and four postoperative deaths were related to hemorrhage and its complications. Visceral infarction was the most frequent cause of postoperative death. The intraoperative complications that were determined to be related to the medial visceral rotation approach included splenic injury (n = 23, 21.3%), one aortic injury, and one adrenal injury. The aortic injury was associated with substantial intraoperative bleeding and subsequent death. The postoperative complications resulting from MVR included pancreatitis (n = 5), which contributed to death in two patients, and possibly some of the cases of visceral infarction not associated with visceral reconstruction. The other common postoperative complications, cardiac (n = 25, 24.0%), pulmonary (n = 32, 30.8%), renal (n = 20, 19.2%), and infectious (n = 17, 16.3%), were attributed to the procedures performed.\nTransabdominal MVR exposure of the upper abdominal aorta provides unrestricted access to the visceral branch-bearing segment of the aorta and places no limitations on the choice of arterial reconstruction technique. The associated morbidity and mortality rates are typical of patients undergoing these complex vascular repairs, but the frequency of splenic injury and postoperative pancreatitis is increased.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic measurement techniques for determining intima-media thickness and total arterial wall thickness have been described. The intima-media thickness measurements are currently in use in large epidemiologic trials. Intima-media thickness does not evaluate extramedial atherosclerotic change and so may not fully reflect pathologic changes in the arterial wall.\nAfter we performed variability studies of B-mode image acquisition and measurement, we measured total wall thickness and intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries in 60 adult subjects in three groups: a control group aged 20 to 29 years, a control group aged 60 to 79 years, and a claudication group aged 60 to 79 years. Measurements were made with B-mode ultrasound images.\nNo statistical difference between sexes was noted. A statistically significant (p < or = 0.05) increase in intima-media thickness and wall thickness was found with increasing age, and an additional increase was observed with clinically significant lower extremity arterial occlusive disease (p < or = 0.05). Image quality had an effect on measurement accuracy.\nThe finding that the wall thickness of common carotid arteries is increased in those patients with clinically significant lower extremity disease supports the theory that atherosclerosis affects the arterial wall in a systemic fashion. Because intima-media thickness also increases across subject groups without change in its proportional contribution to the total arterial wall thickness, extramedial arterial changes also occur with aging and the development of atherosclerosis. We propose that because increases in wall thickness measurements of common carotid arteries follow intima-media thickness increase (but do not necessarily measure the same physiologic change) and the wall thickness method can be used in cases when the intima-media thickness cannot be measured, arterial wall thickness measurement may serve as an alternate or confirmatory test of peripheral artery atherosclerotic severity.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to treat an established prosthetic vascular graft infection by in situ replacement with a rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed Dacron graft in an animal model.\nThe infrarenal aorta of 18 dogs was replaced with a gelatin-sealed graft contaminated in vitro by soaking it in a solution with Staphylococcus epidermidis. One week later, animals were randomized into three groups. In group I (control, (n = 6), the dogs did not undergo repeat operations. The dogs in groups II and III underwent repeat operation. In these animals the infected grafts were removed for bacteriologic analysis and replaced in situ with one of two types of grafts: group II (n = 6) received an untreated, gelatin-sealed graft; group III (n = 6) received a rifampin-bonded, gelatin-sealed graft. Antibiotic bonding was obtained by soaking grafts for 15 minutes in a 60 mg/ml saline solution of rifampin at 37 degrees C. All 18 dogs received no systemic adjunct antibiotic therapy. Control grafts and replacement grafts were removed 4 weeks after the initial implantation for bacteriologic analysis. When harvested, all the grafts were cut into two fragments, and quantitative bacterial cultures were obtained from all the fragments. Results were expressed as colony-forming units (CFU)/cm2 of graft material.\nAll 18 initially implanted grafts and all the untreated replacement grafts were grossly infected at the time of removal, whereas all the rifampin-bonded replacement grafts had normal incorporation. None of the rifampin-bonded grafts grew bacteria, whereas all the initially implanted and all the untreated replacement grafts were infected (p < 0.01). Bacterial counts from the infected fragments were similar in control grafts (2.6 +/- 1.9 x 10(6) CFU/cm2), in initially implanted grafts of groups II (9 +/- 1.1 x 10(5) CFU/cm2) and III (1.3 +/- 1.5 x 10(6) CFU/cm2), and in untreated replacement grafts of group II (1.7 +/- 2.5 x 10(6) CFU/cm2). Blood culture results and culture results of liver, spleen, kidney, and lung specimens at the time of sacrifice were negative.\nThis study demonstrates that rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed Dacron grafts are resistant to infection when used for in situ replacement of an infected graft in the dog.",

Advantages over previously described exposures include a shorter graft, ease of graft alignment, protection of the peroneal nerve, and the absence of a lateral counterincision. This exposure has been used on 12 of 14 anterior tibial grafts during the past 2 years.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic injury to the spinal cord, kidneys, and viscera occurs in a significant number of patients undergoing surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Partial bypass has been used to perfuse the arterial system distal to the cross-clamp, but the primary determinant of ischemic morbidity remains the duration of aortic cross-clamping. Hypothermia may favorably affect outcome during these procedures, but moderate or deep hypothermia has traditionally required full cardiopulmonary bypass with cardiac arrest.\nIn a series of patients undergoing thoracoabdominal (n = 14) or thoracic (n = 4) aneurysm repair, we used moderate hypothermia (30 degrees C) and partial bypass (aortofemoral or atriofemoral) while maintaining an intrinsic cardiac rhythm. Body temperature was controlled with a heat exchanger in the bypass circuit, which allowed for rapid cooling and rewarming. In addition to hypothermia and bypass, a segmental sequential surgical repair was used to minimize the duration of ischemia to any given vascular bed.\nAll patients survived the surgical procedure, and 16 patients survived until discharge from the hospital. None of the 18 patients had paraplegia or significant renal dysfunction. The only complication related to hypothermia was atrial fibrillation, which occurred in three patients and was amenable to therapeutic measures.\nWe conclude that moderate hypothermia, partial bypass, and segmental sequential repair may reduce ischemic injury. This combination of adjuncts was not associated with significant complications in this series of patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to describe the indications, technique, and results for ultrasound-guided compression repair (UGCR) of postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms at a large medical center in which catheter-based diagnostic and interventional procedures are frequently used.\nWe reviewed the initial series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent UGCR in our noninvasive vascular laboratory from May 1991 through August 1992. Nearly all (n = 95) of these pseudoaneurysms involved the common femoral artery or its major branches, and each was manually compressed with a 5 MHz linear transducer for 10-minute intervals until the pseudoaneurysm was completely occluded or the procedure was considered to be a failure.\nUCGR was immediately successful in 94 patients, including 30 (86%) of 35 patients who were receiving anticoagulants and 64 (98%) of the 65 who were not (p = 0.019). The average compression time to achieve occlusion was 33 minutes (range 10 to 120 minutes), but was nearly twice as long (51 minutes) for pseudoaneurysms that had been present for more than 14 days. There were no related complications, but recurrent pseudoaneurysms occurred in six (20%) of 30 patients who continued to receive formal anticoagulation, compared with only four (6%) of 64 who did not (p = 0.074). Eight of the 10 recurrences were discovered within 24 hours after primary UGCR, but two others presented at 16 and 35 days, respectively. Eight recurrent lesions were corrected by repeat UGCR, whereas the remaining two required surgical repair.\nUGCR provides a reliable alternative to surgical treatment for postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms. Adequate follow-up is important, however, especially in patients for whom continued anticoagulation is necessary.",

There were no related complications, but recurrent pseudoaneurysms occurred in six (20%) of 30 patients who continued to receive formal anticoagulation, compared with only four (6%) of 64 who did not (p = 0.074). Eight of the 10 recurrences were discovered within 24 hours after primary UGCR, but two others presented at 16 and 35 days, respectively. Eight recurrent lesions were corrected by repeat UGCR, whereas the remaining two required surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "A gelatin-sealed porous Dacron graft impregnated with rifampin was evaluated in a two-part study of its use in preventing prosthetic infection.\nThe graft was impregnated by soaking it for 15 minutes in rifampin (1 mg/ml). In part 1 its antibacterial activity and rifampin retention over time were determined. Infrarenal aortic replacement was performed in pigs, and the rifampin concentration of the graft, serum, and perigraft space was assayed up to 96 hours after surgery. In part 2, infection resistance was tested in pigs in which the retroperitoneum was contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus after graft replacement. The postoperative infection rate was compared in three groups: pigs given gelatin-sealed grafts without rifampin (controls), pigs receiving nonimpregnated grafts and intravenous rifampin (15 mg/kg) for 3 days after surgery, and those given the rifampin grafts.\nRifampin was present in the grafts for up to 72 hours after surgery and in the perigraft fluid for 24 hours but was never detected in the serum. The grafts had inhibitory activity in vitro against S. aureus and the biofilm phase of Staphylococcus epidermidis for up to 3 days and against Escherichia coli for 2 days. Pigs given intravenous rifampin had a significantly lower infection rate than had control pigs (7/12 vs 13/13; p = 0.02); those receiving the rifampin graft had a lower rate (2/13) than had either the control pigs (p < 0.001) or those given intravenous rifampin (p < 0.04).\nThis simple method of graft impregnation resulted in antibiotic retention for 3 days and appeared to be superior to intravenous antibiotic administration in preventing perioperative graft infection.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to document the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and associated cardiac complications among patients with symptoms of premature peripheral vascular disease.\nWe studied the peripheral and coronary arterial circulations of 59 consecutive male military veterans diagnosed with premature peripheral vascular disease (age of onset < or = 45 years) affecting the lower extremity. Patients who had not previously undergone coronary angiography underwent exercise stress testing. Patients unable to perform exercise testing and those with abnormal exercise test results underwent coronary angiography.\nThere was no evidence of CAD in 16 patients (29%) on the basis of normal exercise test results (n = 12) or normal coronary angiography results (n = 4). Forty-three patients (71%) had significant (> or = 50% lesion) CAD by coronary catheterization. Cardiac complications were frequent among the 43 patients. Eleven (65%) of the 17 patients with single-vessel CAD had previously documented myocardial infarctions, as did three (75%) of the four patients with two-vessel CAD and 18 (82%) of the 22 patients with three vessel or greater CAD. Three (18%) patients with one-vessel CAD had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for symptoms, as had one patient (25%) with two-vessel CAD and 19 patients (86%) with three-vessel or greater CAD. Five patients died during the study period, four of myocardial infarction and one of stroke.\nPremature peripheral atherosclerosis is associated with a high prevalence of CAD. Detection of CAD is important in this group, because cardiac complications are frequent.",

    "abstract": "A newly devised hybrid small-caliber graft was developed. The graft consisted of three components: a microporous polyurethane graft (inside diameter 3 mm; length 5 cm) with compliance close to that of a natural artery; an artificial basement membrane composed of a complex gel of type I collagen and dermatan sulfate, which showed enhanced adhesion and growth of endothelial cells (ECs) and reduced adhesion of platelets in vitro; and an autogenous EC monolayer with high degrees of cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions, which was performed before implantation.\nTwenty EC-seeded grafts were implanted bilaterally into carotid arteries of dogs without anticoagulant. The implantation period was up to 26 weeks.\nThe overall patency rate for seeded grafts was 75%. The percentage of endothelial coverage of seeded grafts was 98% as implanted, 92% at 2 weeks, and 100% after 12 weeks. The mean intimal thickness of grafts was around 80 microns at 12 weeks. Little additional increase was observed at 26 weeks.\nIt appears that the complete endothelialization as implanted, high cell-to-substrate adhesive strength that resists hydrodynamic shear stress, and biomechanical compatibility of the polyurethane graft functioned cooperatively to provide a vascular graft with high antithrombogenicity and minimal hyperplasia. The integrated approach of combining biomechanical and cellular engineering designs leading to an important functional smaller-caliber graft is discussed.",

To date, however, no large series has studied the predictive value of duplex sonography in the diagnosis of carotid artery occlusion, an important consideration, given the marked difference in clinical treatment between patients with high-grade stenosis (surgical therapy) and those with occlusive disease (nonsurgical therapy).\nWe retrospectively reviewed 158 patients with 174 occluded carotid artery segments (examined over a 6 1/2-year period) to determine the predicative value of duplex sonography in differentiating carotid artery occlusion from high-grade stenosis.\nAll patients had arteriographic correlation. Duplex ultrasonography had a positive predictive value of 92.5% (7.5% false-positive rate; 95% confidence interval, 3.6% to 11.4%) in establishing a diagnosis of carotid artery occlusion. Further analysis revealed no significant improvement in the false-positive rate with the addition of color Doppler flow imaging to high-resolution B-mode scanning and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis. Predictive value increased to 96.7% (95% confidence interval, 90.7% to 99.3%) over the last 2 years of the study, a statistically significant improvement.\nWe believe that duplex ultrasonography is an acceptably accurate method for diagnosing carotid arterial occlusion in most patients.

Mean hospital costs and length of stay per admission were calculated for subgroups of patients defined by procedure and indication, and multiple regression analysis was performed.\nFor all admissions the mean hospital cost for angioplasty was $16,341 and for bypass it was $17,076 (nonsignificant difference).

    "abstract": "Ischemic injuries to the lower extremity are often graded in severity according to their duration. Other determinants may also influence the extent of an injury, however, and may be equally significant contributors to the final outcome. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative influences of ischemic time, temperature, residual blood flow, muscle location, and fiber type on postischemic necrosis in a rabbit model of skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nAnimals' hindlimbs were rendered ischemic under differing conditions of each determinant and then reperfused for 48 hours. Necrosis in the rectus femoris, semimembranosus, anterior tibial, and soleus muscles was determined by nitroblue tetrazolium staining and computerized planimetry. The severity of each animal's injury was quantified by calculating the cumulative percentage of necrosis by weight of all muscles excised from the ischemic limb.\nFour hours of ischemia at room temperature resulted in an average of 21% +/- 7% necrosis. Lengthening the ischemic interval to 5 hours increased necrosis to 61% +/- 4% (p < 0.01 vs 4 hours); however injuries were equally or more significantly influenced by changes in ischemic temperature or small changes in ischemic limb residual (collateral) blood flow. The most severe injuries of any encountered were observed when limbs were maintained at body temperature during ischemia (92% +/- 9% necrosis after 5 hours of ischemia, p < 0.01 vs room temperature ischemia), whereas extremely small improvements in ischemic period residual flow (by allowing pelvic collateral cross-flow during ischemia) resulted in significant salvage in all muscles studied. Muscles predominating in fast-twitch fibers had significantly greater necrosis than did those richer in slow-twitch fibers; this difference was apparent only after longer periods (5 hours) of ischemia. Thigh muscles sustained significantly greater injuries than did distal hindlimb muscles, except in animals subjected to body temperature ischemia, where the distribution of necrosis was uniform.\nThe results of this study indicate that muscle necrosis accompanying an ischemic event can be significantly influenced by numerous determinants in addition to ischemic time, each of which warrants careful clinical scrutiny when appraising the extent of an injury.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated operative mortality rate and adverse cardiac events after carotid endarterectomy. Efficacy of preoperative cardiac evaluation was studied and stroke mortality rate was determined.\nThis was a retrospective review of 562 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy at a 740-bed community hospital. Data were analyzed with chi 2 analysis, logistic regression analysis, and Goldman criteria for cardiac risk.\nThe mortality rate was 1.6% (nine patients). There were 10 myocardial infarctions (1.8%). Six of these (1.1%) were fatal. The Goldman Index allowed us to classify 530 patients in a low-risk group (Goldman classes I and II, operative mortality rate = 1.1%) and 32 patients in a high-risk group (Goldman classes III and IV, mortality rate = 9.4%). Independent risk variables were identified for myocardial infarction and overall operative death. These variables were then used to develop a probability model for prediction of operative death and adverse cardiac events. The stroke rate in the 562 patients was 0.7% (four patients). For the 345 patients with symptoms, the stroke rate was 0.6% (two patients); for the 217 symptom-free patients, it was 0.9% (two patients). The combined stroke mortality rate was 2.3%. For patients with symptoms, it was 2.9%; for symptom-free patients, it was 1.4%.\nIndependent clinical variables can help determine patients at increased risk for perioperative myocardial infarction or operative death. Patients in Goldman classes III and IV are at increased risk for adverse events. Carotid surgery can be performed safely in our medical community.",

    "abstract": "Controversy exists regarding the extent of vascular reconstructive surgery in the presence of unilateral symptomatic iliac obstructive disease. This study reviews the results of unilateral iliac reconstruction, with special emphasis on the need for consecutive contralateral intervention.\nThe outcomes of 184 unilateral and 350 aortobilateral reconstructions for obstructive disease performed during the same period were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment allocation was based on hemodynamic parameters. Unilateral reconstruction was performed by a way of a retroperitoneal approach through a pararectal incision and bilateral reconstruction by way of a transperitoneal approach through a midline abdominal incision.\nSymptom relief, improvement of noninvasively measured parameters, and graft patency were similar after unilateral and bilateral reconstruction. Both groups had a 10-year primary patency rate greater than 80%. There were no differences in morbidity rate, although respiratory complications occurred more often after bilateral reconstruction. Mortality rates were 1.6% after unilateral reconstruction and 4.9% after bilateral reconstruction. Secondary contralateral reconstruction was performed in only 6% of the patients who underwent an initial unilateral operation.\nThe unilateral vascular reconstruction for iliac obstructive disease is a well-tolerated procedure with an excellent long-term outcome. It is a valuable alternative to conventional aortobilateral reconstruction in carefully selected patients. Prophylactic reconstruction of an asymptomatic iliac stenosis without signs of significant hemodynamic impairment is most often not indicated.",

    "abstract": "Cell transplantation onto prosthetic vascular grafts remains an attractive technique to reduce the thrombogenicity of polymeric materials. In this study we evaluated whether autologous cells isolated from falciform ligament fat and transplanted onto the lumenal surface of 4 mm expanded polytetrafluorethylene grafts were the same cells present on the surface of these grafts when they were explanted from canine carotid arteries 3 weeks after their implantation.\nThe fluorescent dye PKH-26 was used to label transplanted cells to evaluate their fate after implantation of grafts as carotid artery replacements. This fluorescent dye homogeneously labeled all cells in the primary cell isolate.\nIn vitro studies indicated that dye labeling was nontoxic, as evidenced by the normal growth characteristics of fluorescently labeled cells compared with nonlabeled cells. Immunocytochemical analysis of microvascularized fat before cell isolation determined that approximately 90% of the cells stained positive for von Willebrand factor2. At the time of explant, seeded grafts exhibited a nonthrombogenic lumenal cell lining as evidenced by the lack of adherent platelets or fibrin. Cells on the lumenal surface of grafts exhibited PKH-26 fluorescence emission. In addition, these cells expressed von Willebrand factor and actively sequestered DiI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein.\nWe conclude that sodding of prosthetic grafts with autologous microvascularized fat-derived cells results in the formation of an endothelial cell lining on the lumenal flow surface. These endothelial cells are the same cells placed on the lumenal surface of the graft at the time of initial cell transplantation. Finally, a confluent monolayer forms after high-density cell sodding by the process of cell adherence and spreading, without the need for cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Selecting the most appropriate surgical approach for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and concurrent gastric cancer remains controversial. In an attempt to develop guidelines for the management of two concurrent lesions, a retrospective review of patients with concomitant AAA and gastric cancer was undertaken.\nDuring the period from January 1985 to December 1992, a total of 222 patients with AAA were admitted to our hospital. Among these, seven patients (3.2%) had gastric cancer and concurrent AAA. Six of the seven patients were treated surgically for both lesions with either a one- or two-stage operation. One patient underwent only an exploratory laparotomy because of the peritoneal dissemination of the gastric cancer. Four of the six patients underwent a two-stage operation. In three cases, the resection of the malignancy was performed first because the gastric cancer was diagnosed as advanced before operation. In one case, the aneurysmectomy was performed first because the aneurysm was more than 6 cm in diameter and the gastric cancer was in an early stage of development. Two of the six patients underwent a one-stage operation and a simultaneous resection was carried out by way of segregated approaches, such as the retroperitoneal approach for AAA and the transperitoneal approach for the malignant lesion.\nFive of the seven patients (71.4%) are still alive. The length of follow-up for these patients ranged from 4 months to 4 years.\nThe principles of our surgical approaches for concomitant AAA and gastric cancer are as follows. (1) The lesion that absolutely indicates urgent operation should be operated on first. (2) If the malignant lesion is advanced, it is resected first. (3) If the malignancy is not advanced, the AAA should be resected first by the retroperitoneal approach. (4) Simultaneous resection by way of segregated approaches is useful in some patients with early gastric cancer. (5) Both lesions must be resected eventually for improvement of the long-term survival chances.",

    "abstract": "Thirty-nine reoperations in 38 patients with recurrent symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome were performed by the supraclavicular approach. Scarring around the brachial plexus was the primary cause in 59% of procedure, whereas in 41% of reoperations residual osseous and soft tissue anomalies were identified in the supraclavicular area and were responsible for recurrence of symptoms. Anterior and middle scalenectomy and neurolysis of the brachial plexus were the procedures of choice. Complications included pleural entry (62%), lymphatic leak (10%), brachial plexus and phrenic nerve injuries (5% each), and long thoracic and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies (3% each). The initial success rate for secondary operations was 74%, and long-term success at 18 months was 45%. Patients who had demonstrable anatomic anomalies had better short- and long-term results than had patients with scarring alone. Compared with the results of primary operations for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, reoperations led to a longer hospital stay and inferior long-term results. Supraclavicular decompression allows maximal exposure of the brachial plexus and identification and correction of causative soft tissue and bony anomalies. For these reasons we recommend this as the approach of choice in both primary and secondary operations for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion may be slowed by beta-adrenergic antagonists.\nOne hundred twenty-one patients with infrarenal AAA were monitored with serial aortic ultrasound examinations. Eighty-three patients received no beta-blockers (group I), and 38 patients received beta-blockers (group II). Values are expressed as mean +/- SD.\nThe mean follow-up was 43 +/- 29 months with 5.5 +/- 3.4 ultrasound examinations per patient. The expansion rate among all AAA was 0.38 +/- 0.44 cm/yr. Large aneurysms (> or = 5 cm) expanded significantly faster than small aneurysms (p = 0.02) in patients not treated with beta-blockers. Among patients with large AAA, those receiving beta-blockers had a significantly reduced mean expansion rate; 0.36 +/- 0.20 versus 0.68 +/- 0.64 cm/yr, (p < 0.05). Although rupture rates were lower in group I (5%) versus group II (13%), this difference was not statistically significant. Thirty-four patients in a poor-risk category with AAA were monitored greater than 5 cm in diameter. Ten of these AAA ruptured. The mean expansion rate was significantly greater in those patients with ruptured AAA versus those patients with AAA that did not rupture; 0.82 +/- 0.74 versus 0.42 +/- 0.41 cm/yr (p = 0.04).\nIn patients not undergoing beta-blocker therapy, large AAA expand at a significantly greater rate than smaller AAA. Large aneurysms that rupture show more rapid expansion than those AAA that do not rupture. We have demonstrated a significantly reduced rate of expansion of large AAA in patients receiving beta-blockade.",

    "abstract": "Estrogens have been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. The mechanisms are unknown. In this study we investigated the effect of estrogen treatment on arterial neointimal proliferation elicited by balloon injury of blood vessels of the rabbit.\nThe aorta and the common and external iliac arteries of the rabbit underwent balloon injury. 17-beta-Estradiol cypionate (100 micrograms/kg/day intramuscularly) was administered beginning 1 day before injury and until sacrifice at 22 to 24 days after injury. Angiopeptin (20 micrograms/kg/day) was administered for the same length of time as estrogen to a group of rabbits to use this peptide as a positive control for morphometric analysis. Angiopeptin was also combined with estradiol to determine whether it was possible to further enhance the effect of estrogen. Morphometric studies were performed to determine measurement of intimal thickening. Inhibition of cell proliferation by estrogen was evaluated by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in vitro into the balloon injured rabbit aorta 72 hours after balloon injury.\nTreatment of male rabbits with estradiol significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the neointimal thickening of these vessels by 50% to 70%. The somatostatin analog, angiopeptin, was similarly effective in the same circumstances. Estradiol failed to further inhibit neointimal thickening when combined with angiopeptin. Treatment with estradiol for 3 days inhibited both thymidine incorporation (p < 0.01) and DNA content in injured vessels.\nEstradiol treatment of rabbits undergoing balloon injury of the aorta and iliac arteries, significantly inhibits the myointimal thickening. This effect of estrogen is mediated by inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Infrarenal aortic cross-clamping performed during vascular reconstructive procedures is often accompanied by systemic supraclamp hypertension. Much of the disease and death that attend aortic cross-clamping centers around hypertension. Many different strategies have been developed to attenuate intraoperative hypertension, and a host of pharmacologic agents are regularly used to lessen the heart-related, cerebral, and systemic effects of clamp-induced hypertension. This study was performed to evaluate two such strategies; the intravenous administration of either trimethaphan camsylate or nitroprusside.\nWe used a highly controllable and reproducible model of aortic cross-clamping in which we have previously shown the hypertension associated with clamping to be an active process mediated by means of a reflex arc. Ten dogs, five treated with nitroprusside (NP group) and five treated with trimethaphan camsylate (TC group), underwent 90 minutes of aortic cross-clamping. During this 90-minute period each group received 30 minutes of antihypertensive therapy.\nControl mean arterial pressure +/- SEM was 80 +/- 5 mm Hg for both groups and increased to 140 +/- 5 mm Hg with clamp application. With antihypertensive treatment the elevation in mean arterial pressure produced by cross-clamping was reduced to preclamp levels in the TC group and only partially (52%) in the NP group, despite very high doses of nitroprusside. Cardiac output (CO) increased in the NP group by 115% and decreased by 36% in the TC group. This increase in CO translates into a large (101%) increase in cardiac minute work for the NP group.\nThe attenuation of clamp-induced hypertension by nitroprusside is associated with a dramatic increase in CO and cardiac work whereas the use of trimethaphan camsylate is not. The use of this ganglionic blocker may be more appropriate in this setting.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) whose morphology makes them unsuited for repair with an endoluminal tube graft can be treated by a combination of a transluminally placed aortofemoral graft and a femorofemoral crossover graft. In addition the technique involves either ligation or balloon occlusion of the contralateral common iliac and internal iliac arteries in such a manner that excludes the AAA from the circulation.\nWe report the use of this technique in three male patients with 6.4 to 7.0 cm diameter AAA. Two had renal impairment and cardiac function too poor to permit open repair, and the third had an unfavorable abdomen caused by previous surgery and the presence of a permanent colostomy. Each patient had an individually tailored Dacron tube graft constructed on the basis of preoperative arteriograms and computed tomography scans. The grafts were delivered transluminally into the aorta through a sheath in the iliac arteries and anchored proximally with a stainless steel stent under radiographic control. The grafts were then anastomosed distally to the femoral artery.\nRecovery was complicated by a midgraft stenosis corrected by percutaneous balloon dilation in one patient, an episode of pulmonary edema in the second and an unexplained pyrexia in the third. Follow-up with duplex scanning confirmed normal flow through the grafts and the presence of thrombus between the prosthetic graft and the aneurysmal sac.\nWe conclude that transluminal placement of an aortofemoral graft combined with a femorofemoral crossover graft is feasible in patients who are unsuited to repair with an endoluminal tube graft. The outcome with this technique is not known and requires further careful evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell transplantation has been suggested as a method to improve the patency of prosthetic grafts used for vascular reconstruction. A major technical concern of all cell transplantation studies has been the purity of cells in the primary isolate used for subsequent transplantation. Accordingly we have evaluated the cellular constituents of liposuction-derived human fat with immunocytochemistry and scanning electron microscopy.\nSamples of liposuction-derived human fat were processed for immunohistochemistry and subsequently stained for the presence of von Willebrand factor (vWF), alpha-smooth muscle cell actin, cytokeratin (peptide 18), and the endothelial cell-specific marker EN4. We also performed histochemistry studies on the cells derived from this fat after collagenase dispersion of the liposuction far.\nImmunohistochemistry revealed that 86.1% of the cells in intact, liposuction-derived fat express vWF, whereas 5.7% of the cells exhibited alpha-smooth muscle cell actin, and 1.0% expressed the mesothelial cell-related antigen, cytokeratin peptide 18. Expression of EN4 was found in 89.6% of the cells counted in intact far. After digestion of fat with collagenase and centrifugal separation of adipocytes from vascular and stromal cells, the expression of vWF, alpha-smooth muscle cell actin, and cytokeratin was 77.5%, 5.8%, and 2.1%, respectively. EN4 expression was observed in 74.6% of the isolated cells. Thus most cells present in liposuction-derived fat, even before tissue digestion and cell isolation, were characterized as endothelium. Although other cells common to mesodermally derived tissue were identified (e.g., adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and mesothelium), they represented a minor fraction of the total cells present. On isolation, the number of cells expressing vWF- and EN4-specific antigens was less than that observed in intact fat.\nThis finding suggests that a portion of cells reacting with antibodies in situ lose vWF and EN4 staining during the isolation procedure. Unlike omentum, liposuction-derived fat predominantly contains adipocytes and endothelial cells. On digestion of liposuction-derived fat and separation of cells, vascular endothelial cells represent the major cellular component.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the indications and the long-term results for femorofemoral revascularization with autogenous vein grafts (AVG) rather than conventional synthetic materials.\nA consecutive series of 13 men and 12 women (mean age 64 years) receiving femorofemoral AVG was collected during a retrospective review of our experience from 1979 to 1992. Sixteen of these 25 patients required revascularization for acute ischemia in the presence of potential groin contamination (group 1), and the remaining nine had frank infections involving previous synthetic grafts (group 2). New grafts were constructed with the greater saphenous vein in 23 patients (92%) and with the cephalic vein in two.\nOne patient in each group (8%) died after operation with patent grafts. Preoperative and postoperative ankle/brachial indexes (ABI) were available for 12 patients in group 1 and for seven patients in group 2. There was significant improvement in the ABI among 11 patients with ischemia in group 1 (mean 0.33 +/- 0.13; p = 0.0001), whereas no change in the ABI occurred in conjunction with the replacement of patent infected grafts among six patients in group 2 (mean 0.04 +/- 0.17; p = NS). One patient from each group sustained a reduction in postoperative ABI for the recipient limb despite a patent AVG. Cumulative 3-year survival and primary patency estimates for all 23 operative survivors were 63% and 75%, respectively. Late results seemed to be comparable in group 1 and group 2, but each contained too few patients for adequate analysis.\nDespite their infrequent use, AVG seem to represent a reasonable alternative to synthetic bypass for femorofemoral revascularization in patients having either contaminated wounds or established graft infections.",

    "abstract": "The response of arterial wall to endovascular stenting after angioplasty is not well understood. Additionally, changes in the elastic properties of stented vessels are unknown in situ. Vascular compliance was measured in normal canine iliac arteries (n = 11) before and after intravascular ultrasound-guided deployment of self-expandable metallic stents.\nNine animals were restudied and killed 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initial deployment, and two dogs were studied at deployment only. An absolute induction angiometer was used to make in situ measurements of vessel compliance via catheter-based delivery. The angiometer consists of a wire loop probe, which conforms to the diameter of the vessel in which it is placed. Systolic/diastolic changes in loop diameter are translated into measureable changes of induced voltage.\nMean compliance of the artery before and immediately after stenting was 4.4 +/- 2.1 and 1.9 +/- 2.0 (x 10(-2) diameter %/mm Hg), respectively. As early as 1 week after deployment, stented arteries began to lose expansile properties, and some were noncompliant. At explantation diminished compliance was accompanied by a periadventitial fibrous reaction around stented vessels. A thin, unobstructing layer of neointimal hyperplasia covered the iliac stents at all intervals, and all vessels remained patent and free of thrombus.\nThe potential advantages provided by a flexible, radially compliant stent are lost within a relatively short time after implantation in nonatherosclerotic canine arteries.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of a prospective analysis of 147 patients undergoing surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and recorded in the Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery Aneurysm Registry, this study defines the early and 6-year actuarial survival rates and determines the predictive variables that are associated with survival.\nOngoing follow-up of a cohort of patients was current at the time of analysis. To identify the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables that were associated with survival, statistical methods included chi-squared analysis, logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis.\nThe survival rate was 48.6% at 1 month, 34.7% +/- 4.2% at 3 years, and 22.0% +/- 4.0% at 6 years. When preoperative and intraoperative variables were considered and logistic regression analysis was used, the highest probability of early in-hospital survival was associated with preoperative creatinine levels of 1.3 mg/dl or less, intraoperative urine output of 200 ml or greater, and infrarenal clamp site. The highest probability of late survival, as calculated by the Cox proportional hazards method, was predicted by the patient's age and total urine output during the procedure. When all variables, including postoperative complications, were considered, late survival was highest if intraoperative urine output was 200 ml or greater and respiratory failure and myocardial infarction did not occur. For those patients with ruptured AAA who survived operation (i.e., greater than 1 month), the long-term survival rate was significantly lower than a comparable group undergoing repair of nonruptured AAA.\nPatients who survive repair of a ruptured AAA have a lower late survival rate than patients undergoing elective repair. When a patient is evaluated before operation, no combination of preoperative variables could identify those patients with little or no chance of survival; hence, the decision to repair a ruptured AAA should be made on clinical grounds. However, after surgery (when information on intraoperative and postoperative variables is also available), the results of this study provide a basis for the surgeon to use these prognostic variables to assist clinical judgment and guide discussions on prognosis with the family and to identify those patients who have such a low chance of early and late survival that further aggressive treatment may be futile.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the protective effect of two methods of hypothermia against ischemic spinal cord injury: one-shot perfusion cooling and percutaneous topical cooling.\nTwenty-five rabbits were divided into five equal groups. The abdominal aorta was isolated proximally by a vascular clamp and distally by an inflated balloon catheter for 60 minutes. Group I served as control. In groups II (2.5 ml/min) and III (5.0 ml/min), hypothermic lactated Ringer's solution was infused for 3 minutes from the distal end of the catheter. Ice blocks were placed behind the backs of rabbits 30 minutes before ischemia in group IV. Group V underwent the procedures combined with those in groups II and IV (infusion of hypothermic solution plus placement of ice blocks). Another 15 rabbits underwent laminectomy at the L2 or L3 level. A temperature probe was inserted into the spinal cord to monitor cord temperature continuously during the procedures in all five groups (three rabbits per group).\nNeurologic status on the second postoperative day in groups IV and V was significantly superior to that in group I (p < 0.01), but the neurologic status of groups II and III did not differ significantly from the neurologic status of group I. The spinal cord temperature in groups II and III dropped rapidly with the infusion, but it rose again quickly. In contrast, the spinal cord was kept sufficiently hypothermic during ischemia in groups IV and V.\nWe concluded that the percutaneous cooling method can keep the spinal cord sufficiently hypothermic during ischemia to lead to a significantly superior neurologic outcome.",

Initially, 66 patients had claudication and 43 had severe ischemia. Cardiovascular risk factors were smoking (85%), hypertension (47%), coronary artery disease (30%), hyperlipidemia (27%), diabetes (25%), and visceral arteriopathy (17%). Unique risk factors included hypercoagulability (15%) and clinical arterial hypoplasia (15%). Twenty-three (21%) patients were treated medically; 74 (68%) underwent primary revascularization and 12 (11%) primary major limb amputation. Forty-six (53%) patients required secondary procedures, of which 34 (74%) were performed within 1 year of primary intervention. A total of 29 (27%) patients ultimately required amputation (10 bilateral). Women had higher prevalence of diabetes (p < 0.01), arterial hypoplasia (p < 0.05), and tendency for more severe ischemia (p = 0.11). No racial differences in severity of symptoms or outcome of treatment were found. By multiple logistic regression analysis, typical cardiovascular risk factors did not predict severity of symptoms, need for surgical treatment, or outcome. However, diabetes was associated with tissue loss (p < 0.05) and primary amputation (p < 0.001). Further, adjusted odds ratios indicate that arterial hypoplasia had a protective effect on distal vasculature (p < 0.05) and predicting need for revascularization (p < 0.05), but not on treatment failure. Hypercoagulability had the highest predictive value for presence of severe ischemia (p < 0.05), need for primary amputation (p < 0.01), and early failure of surgical treatment (p < 0.05).",

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysms are characterized by the destruction of the extracellular matrix of the media, whereas occlusive disease involves excess matrix accumulation within the intima. Plasmin degrades extracellular matrix directly and indirectly by activation of latent metalloenzymes. To determine the expression of tissue- and urokinase-type plasminogen activators, immunoassay, fibrin autography, Northern analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed on specimens of aneurysmal (n = 12), occlusive (n = 8), and healthy (n = 6) aorta.\nImmunoassay of tissue-type plasminogen activator revealed 8.7 +/- 0.9 ng tissue-type plasminogen activator/mg extracted protein in aneurysmal aorta, 5.7 +/- 0.3 ng/mg in normal aorta, and 2.5 +/- 0.3 ng/mg in occlusive aorta (p < 0.05 for comparisons between all groups).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to better define the associated risks and optimal management of groin lymphatic complications (GLC) after femoral artery reconstructive operations.\nRetrospective review of a vascular surgery registry for the last 15 years identified 2679 arterial operations requiring a groin incision. Forty-one GLC were recognized, 28 lymphocutaneous fistulas (LF) and 13 lymphoceles.\nThe incidence of GLC was 1.5% per patient or 1.2% per incision. The highest incidence of GLC was in patients having an aortobifemoral bypass for aneurysmal disease in a previously operated groin (8.1% per patient) and in those undergoing an isolated femoral procedure in a previously operated groin (5.3%). The lowest frequency of GLC was after femoropopliteal/tibial bypasses (0.5%). Twenty-nine patients (71%) were treated without operation with bedrest, intravenous antibiotics, and aggressive local wound care. Operative therapy with wound reexploration attempted identification and control of the leak site, and meticulous wound closure was used in 12 patients (29%). Lymph fistulas in patients undergoing reoperation (10/28) resolved sooner than in patients treated without operation (18/28) (9 +/- 3 days vs 24 +/- 3 days). Infectious wound complications with one resultant graft infection developed in five of 18 patients with LF who did not undergo reoperation. There were no wound or graft infections in the patients in the LF group treated with operation. Operative exploration of lymphoceles did not reduce hospital stay or infectious wound complications. Repetitive lymphocele aspiration did not affect rapidity of resolution or increase the infectious complications.\nGLC remain a troublesome complication of femoral arterial reconstruction. Early reoperation should be performed once a LF is diagnosed. Treatment for lymphoceles should be individualized, with neither operative nor nonoperative management showing clear superiority.",

    "abstract": "Aortofemoral bypass (AFB) is a durable reconstruction; however, graft limb occlusion occurs in 10% to 20% of patients and results in limb ischemia. Treatment of AFB limb occlusion has been debated, but many recommended femorofemoral bypass (FFB). FFB grafts have had excellent patency rates. The durability of FFB specifically for AFB limb occlusion has not been reported. This study retrospectively examined a 10-year experience with FFB for AFB limb occlusion to determine FFB performance.\nBetween 1982 and 1992, FFB was performed on occluded AFB limbs in 22 patients (14 men and 8 women). Reoperation was performed for disabling claudication in five cases, but the remaining 17 patients (77%) had critical limb ischemia. FFB originated from the contralateral patent AFB limb in all cases. Distal anastomosis was to the common femoral artery (n = 8) or the profunda femoris (n = 14). FFB graft patency was confirmed by direct Doppler arterial examination over a mean follow-up of 47 months.\nThe cumulative life-table primary patency rate of FFB was 54% at 5 years. Reoperative procedures performed in nine cases resulted in a secondary patency rate of 84% at 5 years. The limb salvage rate was also 84% at 5 years, reflecting the impact of successful reoperation. Major amputations (two below-knee, one above-knee) were necessary in only three cases. There were no perioperative deaths after FFB, and the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 77%.\nAortic graft limb occlusion occurs less frequently than failure of infrainguinal grafts making the success of specific reoperative strategies difficult to document reliably. This study suggests that FFB is a safe and durable alternative for AFB limb failure. An aggressive policy of reoperation has resulted in successful extension of FFB graft function and an excellent rate of limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "Newer approaches to the patient with an infected aortic graft are available. We reviewed a recent 10-year experience with a more traditional approach to evaluate its outcome in the 1990s.\nFrom January 1983 to January 1993, 27 patients with an aortic graft infection were treated at our institution. There were 18 paraprosthetic infections, eight graft enteric erosions, and one aortoduodenal fistula. The involved bypasses included 20 aortofemoral (74%), five aortoiliac (18%), and two aortic tube grafts (8%). Nineteen aortic replacements were done originally for aneurysmal disease (70%). We reviewed the outcome of each patient treated as it related to the method of management. The therapy for graft infection consisted of aortic graft removal and axillofemoral bypass in 20 patients (74%), treatment by an in situ method in four patients (15%), excision of an aortofemoral limb and extraanatomic bypass in two patients (7%), and extraanatomic bypass alone in one patient (4%). In the group treated by graft removal and extraanatomic bypass, four patients (20%) had staged operations (extraanatomic bypass followed by interval aortic graft removal), nine (45%) had single operations with extraanatomic bypass preceding graft removal, and seven (35%) had single operations with graft removal preceding extraanatomic bypass.\nThe 30-day operative mortality rate was 3.7%. There were no instances of aortic stump blowout. The 3-year primary patency rate for axillofemoral bypass limbs was 80.2%, and the secondary patency rate was 87.4%. No limbs were lost as a result of ischemic complications. There was one late amputation for an unrelated problem.\nThe results of alternate approaches to the management of patients with infected aortic grafts were equivalent both in terms of perioperative mortality and morbidity rates in this group of patients. Complete excision of the aortic graft with axillofemoral bypass provided a satisfactory long-term outcome and remains the standard with which other approaches must be compared.",

There was no significant difference in the preoperative medical characteristics between the two anesthetic groups. Symptomatic carotid artery disease was the indication for surgery in 247 (68.4%) patients receiving general anesthetics, whereas 180 (56.6%) patients treated with a cervical block anesthetic had a symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (p = 0.02).\nThe perioperative stroke rate and stroke-death rate for the entire series was 2.4% and 3.2%, respectively, and was not significantly different between the anesthetic groups or between patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. A carotid artery shunt was used in 61 (19.2%) patients receiving a cervical block anesthetic and 152 (42.1%) patients treated with a general anesthetic (p < 0.0001). Use of cervical block anesthesia was associated with a significantly shorter operative time, fewer perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, and a shorter postoperative hospitalization when compared with general anesthesia. Multivariate risk factor analysis indicated that age greater than 75 years, operative time greater than 3 hours, and the use of a carotid artery shunt were all independent risk factors for perioperative cardiopulmonary complications. When a carotid artery shunt was not analyzed as a multivariate risk factor, then general anesthesia became a significant risk factor for perioperative cardiopulmonary complications (risk ratio 2.08; p = 0.04).\nWe conclude that cervical block anesthesia is safer and results in a more efficient use of hospital resources than general anesthesia in the treatment of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of intraoperative duplex scanning on early and late results after carotid endarterectomy.\nWe reviewed 316 carotid arteries in 283 patients who underwent operation since 1986. The results of intraoperative ultrasonography were normal in 254 (80.4%) and abnormal in 62 (19.6%). We did not reexplore 53 (85.5%) of the abnormalities because the defect was minor, 2 to 3 mm or less. These defects were retained atheroma in the common carotid artery (n = 35), internal carotid artery (ICA) (n = 5), external carotid artery (n = 2), small frond in the bulb (n = 2), thickened wall of the vein patch (n = 2), and ICA kink (n = 7), two of which were associated with retained atheroma. Nine defects (14.5%) were reexplored and repaired; there were seven flaps, one residual plaque, and one case with turbulent flow alone.\nPatients with a normal examination result had an early ICA occlusion rate of 0.79% (n = 2), an early stroke rate of 1.6% (n = 4), and one death (0.4%). In the unrepaired group these rates were 1.9% (n = 1) and 1.9% (n = 1), respectively. No occlusion occurred in the repaired group, but one preexisting cerebrovascular accident worsened immediately after operation. Frequency analysis and B-mode imaging were performed after operation and every 6 to 12 months in all patients (mean 21.6 months). A greater than 75% area stenosis was found in nine (17%) of the 53 unrepaired carotid arteries, but in only four (4.3%) of the 254 carotid arteries lacking defects and in one of the reopened group (p < 0.001). There have been no late strokes, and only three late transient ischemic attacks overall.\nA normal intraoperative scanning result obtained after carotid endarterectomy is associated with improved late patency rates. Even small defects appear to be associated with an increased incidence of late restenosis, reemphasizing the importance of technical perfection.",

    "abstract": "Duplex scanning has become the standard for noninvasive evaluation of carotid arteries. However, current ultrasound criteria for internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (16% to 49%, 50% to 79%, 80% to 99%) may not be applicable to the categories (30% to 49%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%) used in ongoing symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid endarterectomy trials. This study was undertaken to determine new velocity criteria consistent with these categories.\nFrom January 1, 1989 through October 30, 1992, 5871 color-flow duplex scans were obtained in our laboratories. After inadequate arteriograms and patients with a contralateral ICA occlusion were excluded, 770 peak systolic velocity (PSV) and 229 end-diastolic velocity (EDV) measurements were available for comparison with arteriography. ICA PSV and EDV were subjected to receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to determine optimum criteria for identifying stenoses of 30%, 50%, and 70%.\nFor 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, PSV greater than 130 plus EDV greater than 100 provided the best sensitivity (81%), specificity (98%), positive predictive value (89%), negative predictive value (96%), and overall accuracy (95%). For 50% to 69% stenosis, a PSV greater than 130 and EDV of 100 or less cm/sec proved to be the best combination: sensitivity (92%), specificity (97%), positive predictive value (93%), negative predictive value (99%), and accuracy (97%). Stenoses in the 30% to 49% range were less accurately identified.\nThese redefined criteria may prove useful for analyzing duplex ultrasound velocity data in reference to the classification of ICA stenosis used in recent clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the current population-based mortality rate for the surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in Michigan, (2) to document changes in mortality rates over 11 years, and (3) to identify risk factors for operative mortality.\nA statewide database provided clinical information on all Michigan hospital admissions with a diagnosis of AAA from 1980 to 1990. The mortality rate analysis included all admissions with a primary diagnosis of AAA that underwent repair. Determination of diagnoses and comorbidities were based on International Classification of Diseases-ninth revision-Clinical Modification codes.\nConventional surgical repairs were performed on 8185 intact and 1829 ruptured AAA. Hospital mortality rates accompanying operation for intact AAA decreased from 13.6% in 1980 to 5.6% in 1990 (p < 0.001). Mortality rates over the 11 years averaged 10.7% in women and 6.8% in men (p < 0.001). Mortality rates averaged 10.7% in 4170 admissions of patients 70 years old or older and 4.2% in 4015 admissions of patients 69 years old or younger. Preexistent kidney failure was associated with an average mortality rate of 41.2% compared with 6.2% without this comorbidity. Preexistent dysrhythmia increased mortality rates from 6.6% to 13.6%. Uncomplicated hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, arterial occlusive disease, and ischemic heart disease in recent years were not associated with increased mortality rates. Hospitals with an annual volume of 21 or more intact AAA repairs had a surgical mortality rate of 6.2%, compared with 8.9% in hospitals with lower surgical volume (p < 0.001). Mortality rates for surgical repair of ruptured AAA averaged 49.8% and did not improve significantly over the 11 years studied.\nDespite a dramatic drop in surgical mortality rates, repair of intact AAA remains a formidable undertaking. This population-based series documents a substantially higher mortality rate than most selected series. The unchanged mortality rate for ruptured AAA suggests that development of better algorithms to identify those AAA most apt to rupture and earlier intervention in those instances is likely to improve patient survival rates.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are associated with diffuse arteriomegaly and peripheral aneurysms, suggesting a generalized process. Elastin and collagen are the key structural proteins of the aorta, and their relative content is markedly altered in tissue from AAA. Our purpose was to investigate elastin and collagen content in the proximal, nonaneurysmal segments of aortas with infrarenal AAA.\nAfter extraction of lipid, calcium, and soluble proteins, hydroxyproline (collagen) and desmosine-isodesmosine (elastin) contents were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in the ascending and descending thoracic, supraceliac, and suprarenal aorta. By repeated measures of analysis of covariance, collagen was found to be increased throughout the aorta in AAA as compared with normal aorta or aorta with atherosclerotic occlusive disease. This difference remained significant when adjustments were made for group differences in age and degree of atherosclerosis. This increase in collagen content results in a dilutional decrease in elastin concentration. These data demonstrate that the same matrix protein alterations found in AAA tissue occur throughout the aorta, differing only in magnitude in the aneurysmal and nonaneurysmal segments. These data suggest that aneurysm formation may related to alterations in the regulation of elastin and collagen.",

    "abstract": "We verified the hypothesis that selective deep hypothermia of the spinal cord during double thoracic aortic clamping can prevent postoperative paraplegia in dogs.\nNormal saline solution was circulated from the cisterna magna through an extracorporeal perfusion system consisting of a reservoir, a pump, and a heat exchanger, back into the subarachnoid space at the level of the medullary cone at a rate of 25 ml/min, starting 30 minutes before clamping, and ending after removal of the clamps. The thoracic aorta was cross-clamped below the left subclavian artery and above the diaphragm for a period of 45 minutes. Cerebrospinal fluid, intracranial, and central venous pressure and aortic pressure proximal, between, and distal to the clamps were continuously recorded. In five dogs, temperature of the circulating normal saline solution at the inflow level was maintained at 2 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees C (group 1), in five controls at 37 degrees +/- 0.8 degrees C (group 2). Five dogs underwent continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage starting before clamping until sacrifice (group 3). Dogs were observed for up to 4 days, and neurologic function was graded by an independent observer with the Tarlov scale. Animals were then killed, and their spinal cords were prepared for microscopic examination.\nHemodynamic parameters were not significantly different between groups. All dogs in groups 2 and 3 were paraplegic with histologic evidence of spinal cord infarction. All animals in group 1 were neurologically normal without microscopic evidence of infarction (p < 0.005).\nSelective deep hypothermia of the spinal cord prevents paraplegia after 45 minutes of double aortic clamping in dogs. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage was not effective in preventing paraplegia in this model.",

An electronically steerable endovascular catheter was used to deliver platinum coils into the venous tributaries to occlude them.\nThe maximal number of coils placed in any limb was nine. Most operations were performed with only a groin incision (length = 9.8 +/- 1.6 cm) and a distal incision (length = 16.8 +/- 6.5 cm). Wound complications occurred in four limbs, whereas four limbs developed localized superficial thrombophlebitis. The postoperative ankle-brachial index increased to a mean of 0.91 +/- 0.12. Postoperative duplex imaging revealed a missed arteriovenous fistula in 12 limbs. Two were surgically ligated, whereas the remainder were embolized in the radiology suite. Postoperative length of hospitalization was 4 +/- 2 days in uncomplicated cases. Follow-up revealed five graft occlusions. Occlusion occurred at 12 hours, 2 weeks, and 6, 14, and 15 months after operation. Although there were no perioperative deaths, two patients have died of unrelated causes.\nThis endovascular technique of arteriovenous fistula embolization decreased the length of the surgical wounds, and patients were discharged 4 +/- 2 days in uncomplicated cases.

    "abstract": "A study was conducted to test the hypothesis that angioscopically assisted valve lysis and vein branch identification during in situ saphenous vein bypass would reduce technical causes of graft failure, local operative morbidity, and hospital stay.\nPatients requiring primary bypass to an infrageniculate artery were randomly assigned to undergo in situ saphenous vein bypass with valvulotomy and branch identification either under angioscopic visualization with use of short intermittent incisions (scope) or under direct vision with use of a continuous incision (no scope). Data on operative details, morbidity, hospital length of stay, and graft patency were collected prospectively and compared.\nFifty-nine patients were enrolled (32 scope, 27 no scope). There were no significant differences between study groups in the incidence of diabetes, claudication versus critical ischemia indications for surgery, or popliteal versus infrapopliteal location of distal anastomoses. Rates of wound complications (9.3% and 3.7%), early graft occlusion (6.2% and 7.4%), and mean postoperative hospital stay (8.0 and 8.6 days) were statistically similar for the scope and no scope groups, respectively. Differences in cumulative secondary patency rates at 48 months (79% scope, 91% no scope) were also insignificant.\nUse of angioscopy to assist with preparation of the in situ vein for infrageniculate grafting appears to have no impact on local operative morbidity, hospital length of stay, or midterm graft patency.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of two clinical strategies for managing 4 to 5 cm diameter abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs): early surgery (repair 4 cm AAA when diagnosed) versus watchful waiting (monitor AAA with ultrasound size measurements every 6 months and repair if the diameter reaches 5 cm).\nWe used a Markov decision tree to compute the expected survival in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy, based on literature-derived estimates for the probabilities of different outcomes in this model. We determined hospital costs for patients undergoing elective and emergency AAA repair at our center. With standard methods of cost accounting, we then calculated the additional cost per year of life saved by early surgery compared with watchful waiting (cost-effectiveness ratio, dollars/QALY).\nMean hospital costs for elective and emergency AAA repair were $24,020 and $43,208, respectively (1992 dollars). For our base-case analysis (60-year-old men with 4 cm diameter AAAs, with 5% elective operative mortality rate and 3.3% annual rupture rate), early surgery improved survival by 0.34 QALYs compared with watchful waiting, at an incremental cost of $17,404/QALY. Increased elective surgical mortality rate, decreased AAA rupture risk, and increased patient age all reduced the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. Future increases in elective operative risk, noncompliance with ultrasound follow-up and increased threshold size for elective AAA repair during watchful waiting all improved the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. Future increases in elective operative risk, noncompliance with ultrasound follow-up and increased threshold size for elective AAA repair during watchful waiting all improved the cost-effectiveness of early surgery.\nThe cost effectiveness of early surgery for 4 cm diameter AAAs in carefully selected patients compares favorably with that of other commonly accepted preventive interventions such as hypertension screening and treatment. With an upper limit of $40,000/QALY as an \"acceptable\" cost-effectiveness ratio, early surgery appears to be justified for patients 70 years old or younger, if the AAA rupture risk is 3%/year or more and the elective operative mortality rate is 5% or less. Although not a substitute for clinical judgment, this cost-effectiveness analysis delineates the essential tradeoffs and uncertainties in treating patients with small AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Although arteries appear to remodel in response to changes in hemodynamic parameters such as shear stress, little is known about functioning human vein grafts. This study was designed to explore diameter changes in human saphenous vein grafts after infrainguinal bypass.\nWe used duplex ultrasonography to measure hemodynamic variables that might affect the diameter of 48 in situ saphenous vein grafts during the first year after infrainguinal arterial bypass. Volumetric flow rate, average velocity, peak systolic velocity, and vein diameter in the proximal and distal thirds of these grafts were each measured at 1 week and at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. Veins were divided into three groups based on initial size (1 week after bypass) in the below-knee segment: small, < 3.5 mm diameter; medium, 3.5 to 4 mm diameter; and large, > 4 mm diameter.\nDistal vein diameters at 1 week for small, medium, and large grafts were 2.9 +/- 0.1, 3.7 +/- 0.1, and 4.3 +/- 0.1 mm, respectively (p < 0.001), but by 12 months these diameters were 3.6 +/- 0.2, 3.8 +/- 0.2, and 3.9 +/- 0.2 mm, respectively (p = 0.54). Large veins decreased in diameter, whereas small veins increased in diameter, as confirmed by linear regression of percent change in diameter versus initial vein graft diameter (r = -0.62, p < 0.001). Volumetric flow rate, peak systolic velocity, and shear stress also tended to approach uniform values over time. Of the hemodynamic variables studied, the best predictor of diameter change was shear stress (linear regression of percent change in diameter vs shear stress, r = 0.67, p < 0.001). Veins with a diameter increase greater than 10% over time had significantly higher initial shear stress than veins with a diameter decrease greater than 10% over time (28.6 +/- 3.8 vs 13.1 +/- 1.8 dynes/cm2, p < 0.01), whereas initial volumetric flow rates in these two groups were similar (135 +/- 23 vs 130 +/- 15 ml/min).\nInfrainguinal in situ vein graft diameter, volume flow rate, peak systolic velocity, and shear stress all tend to stabilize at uniform values regardless of the initial vein graft diameter. Of the hemodynamic variables studied, shear stress is most strongly associated with the change in diameter over time. Thus human saphenous vein appears to be capable of adapting to its hemodynamic environment after arterial grafting by modulating diameter to normalize shear stress.",

It has been suggested, however, that the hemodynamic result of the peroneal bypass is inferior to that of other infrapopliteal artery bypasses, making it suboptimal in patients with forefoot ischemic tissue loss. A retrospective review of 118 recent infrainguinal vein grafts (36 peroneal, 27 anterior tibial, 35 posterior tibial, 20 popliteal) was undertaken to assess and compare the hemodynamic results for each group.\nWe reviewed the hemodynamic results of 36 peroneal bypass grafts assessed by preoperative and postoperative ankle-brachial index and transmetatarsal pulse volume recording, duplex scan-derived distal graft peak systolic flow velocity, and intraoperatively measured outflow resistance. These results were compared with a concurrent series of anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and popliteal artery bypass grafts. All but one of the infrapopliteal bypass grafts were performed for limb salvage, and 65% of patients had ischemic ulcerations or gangrene.\nThere was no difference in postoperative ankle-brachial index, postoperative transmetatarsal pulse volume recording, peak systolic flow velocity, or measured outflow resistance among the four different outflow groups. All patients with peroneal bypass grafts had healed wounds within a mean follow-up period of 17 months. There were no hemodynamic failures.\nPeroneal artery bypass grafts achieved hemodynamic results equivalent to anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and popliteal artery bypass grafts.",

We have used laser Doppler fluxmetry to assess the effect of external compression on the skin microcirculation.\nFifteen patients with lipodermatosclerosis caused by chronic venous insufficiency and 15 control subjects were studied in the supine and sitting positions. The laser Doppler probe, incorporated in a polyethylene chamber, was applied to the lower leg underneath a blood pressure cuff. Pressures were applied from 10 to 100 mm Hg in increments of 10 mm Hg. A computer data logging system recorded laser Doppler flux blood cell velocity, and concentration of moving blood cells.\nIn patients in the supine position, 20 mm Hg compression resulted in a median increase of 33% in laser Doppler flux, and a median increase of 79% in blood cell velocity, but higher pressures caused a progressive decrease in laser Doppler flux and blood cell velocity. With the patient in the sitting position, compression up to 60 mm Hg caused an increase in laser Doppler flux (median percentage increase at 20 mm Hg compression 84%) and blood cell velocity (median percentage increase at 20 mm Hg compression 22%). At 20 mm Hg compression, the concentration of moving blood cells decreased in the supine position (median percentage fall 27%) but did not change significantly in the dependent position. The effects of compression in control subjects were similar to those in patients, but to a lesser degree.\nOur study suggests that compression treatment may achieve part of its effect by causing an increase in the microcirculatory flow velocity.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to study the effects of anastomotic angle on the wall shear stress distribution for end-to-side anastomosis models under pulsatile flow conditions.\nThe photochromic tracer technique was used to visualize the flow field and to determine the instantaneous wall shear stress at multiple locations simultaneously. Models with angles of 20, 30, 45, and 60 degrees were examined.\nFor all angles, low shear stress was present at the heel and on the bed opposite the heel of the anastomosis apparently as a result of the complete occlusion of the proximal end of the host vessel. Near the toe, increased flow separation occurred with increasing angle. On the bed across from the toe, increasing the angle led to increased shear stress. In addition, in this region the anastomotic angle significantly altered other properties of the shear stress field such as the mean and peak-to-peak magnitudes and cycle-to-cycle fluctuations.\nThis study provides quantitative data on the wall shear stress distribution within an end-to-side anastomosis and its relation to the anastomotic angle. The results are discussed in terms of possible roles of shear-induced intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasonography with distal cuff deflation was used to establish the physiologic reflux duration in different segments of the deep venous system in healthy individuals, and to document the occurrence of deep vein valve incompetence in patients after deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nTwo hundred fifty-two vein segments in 42 legs of 21 healthy individuals and 160 deep vein segments in 27 patients with phlebographically documented DVT were examined with duplex scanning.\nThe duration of reflux in healthy subjects was significantly shorter in distal deep vein segments. Ninety-five percent of the values were less than 0.88, 0.8, 0.8, 0.28, 0.2, and 0.12 seconds, respectively, for the common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial vein (at midcalf and ankle level). The 95 percentile for reflux duration in the superficial venous system was 0.5 seconds for all vein segments, regardless of the location. No significant correlation was found between the reflux peak flow velocity and reflux duration (R = 0.6). The reflux peak flow velocity is therefore not useful as a parameter of the degree of reflux. The patient group was examined with an interval of 18 to 51 months (mean 34 months) after DVT. Forty-five percent of the initially affected segments showed valve incompetence at follow-up (n = 54); only three of 40 segments initially free from thrombus showed pathologic reflux at follow-up (p < 0.01). Reflux durations in most of the incompetent vein segments were two or more times the normal value of reflux duration. The highest prevalence of valve incompetence was found in the superficial femoral and popliteal vein segment (p < 0.01). None of the patients showed valve incompetence at all levels of the deep venous system. A significant (p = 0.04) relation was found between the extent of the initial thrombosis and the number of refluxing vein segments at follow-up, but no correlation was found between the extent of initial thrombosis and the late clinical symptoms (p = 0.16); clinical symptoms could not be related to the number of incompetent vein segments.\nDuplex scanning allows a good discrimination between physiologic and abnormal reflux duration and is an important tool in the evaluation of the postthrombotic limb. Early assessment after DVT may have prognostic value in individual patients.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of intermittent calf compression on popliteal arterial blood flow and to see how flow is influenced by position of the subject and by arterial blood pressure at the ankle.\nVolume flow in the popliteal artery of subjects in the sitting and prone positions was measured with duplex ultrasonography before inflation and immediately after deflation of a pneumatic cuff placed around the calf. Eleven legs of control subjects and 41 legs of patients with symptoms (32% patients with diabetes) with decreased ankle pressure were studied. Cuffs were inflated for 2 seconds at pressures ranging from 20 to 120 mm Hg.\nAn increase in arterial blood flow of two to eight times (mean 4.4 +/- 2.0) was found on deflation of the cuff in seated control subjects. Little change in flow was observed when the subjects were in the prone position. In seated patients with arterial obstruction, the mean increase in arterial flow was 3.2 +/- 1.6 times the resting flow. Little correlation was found between the maximum increase in flow and the ankle/brachial index.\nAn increased arteriovenous pressure gradient accounts for some but not all of the flow increase, much of which must be attributable to transient vasodilatation. Because the increase in flow does not depend on an increased inflow pressure and was not adversely affected by a low resting ankle-brachial pressure index or a low toe-pressure, intermittent external limb compression may deserve investigation as a possible adjunct to the nonoperative treatment of patients with severe arterial insufficiency.",

Electron microscopy of the vein grafts in diabetes revealed intercellular gaps in the endothelium lining and abnormal endothelial cell junctions compared with controls. Diabetes significantly increased the maximal contractions generated in vein grafts to all contractile agonists tested without any change in sensitivity.\nThis study demonstrates that diabetes alters endothelial cell structure and increases the development of intimal hyperplasia with increased maximal contractility in vein grafts and therefore suggests that the vein grafts in diabetes are more susceptible to early stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of intraarterial thrombolytic therapy for peripheral arterial occlusive disease, a randomized study comparing its efficacy with that of operative intervention has never been performed. This study evaluates the potential of intraarterial urokinase infusion to provide clinical benefits in patients with acute peripheral arterial occlusion.\nPatients with limb-threatening ischemia of less than 7 days' duration were randomly assigned to intraarterial catheter-directed urokinase therapy or operative intervention. Anatomic lesions unmasked by thrombolysis were treated with balloon dilation or operation. The primary end points of the study were limb salvage and survival.\nA total of 57 patients were randomized to the thrombolytic therapy group, and 57 patients were randomized to the operative therapy group. Thrombolytic therapy resulted in dissolution of the occluding thrombus in 40 (70%) patients. Although the cumulative limb salvage rate was similar in the two treatment groups (82% at 12 months), the cumulative survival rate was significantly improved in patients randomized to the thrombolysis group (84% vs 58% at 12 months, p = 0.01). The mortality differences seemed to be primarily attributable to an increased frequency of in-hospital cardiopulmonary complications in the operative treatment group (49% vs 16%, p = 0.001). The benefits of thrombolysis were achieved without significant differences in the duration of hospitalization (median 11 days) and with only modest increases in hospital cost in the thrombolytic treatment arm (median $15,672 vs $12,253, p = 0.02).\nIntraarterial thrombolytic therapy was associated with a reduction in the incidence of in-hospital cardiopulmonary complications and a corresponding increase in patient survival rates. These benefits were achieved without an appreciable increase in the duration of hospitalization and with only modest increases in hospital cost, suggesting that thrombolytic therapy may offer a safe and effective alternative to operation in the initial treatment of patients diagnosed with acute limb-threatening peripheral arterial occlusion.",

Thrombolytic therapy resulted in dissolution of the occluding thrombus in 40 (70%) patients. Although the cumulative limb salvage rate was similar in the two treatment groups (82% at 12 months), the cumulative survival rate was significantly improved in patients randomized to the thrombolysis group (84% vs 58% at 12 months, p = 0.01). The mortality differences seemed to be primarily attributable to an increased frequency of in-hospital cardiopulmonary complications in the operative treatment group (49% vs 16%, p = 0.001). The benefits of thrombolysis were achieved without significant differences in the duration of hospitalization (median 11 days) and with only modest increases in hospital cost in the thrombolytic treatment arm (median $15,672 vs $12,253, p = 0.02).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of performing carotid endarterectomy procedures with the patient receiving cervical block anesthetic.\nOver the last 14 years, 654 carotid endarterectomy procedures were performed with patients receiving regional anesthetic. Intraluminal shunts were placed on demand, if neurologic changes with clamping of the carotid artery developed in the patient. During the same period, 419 cases were done with the patients receiving general anesthetic. Choice of anesthetic was based on surgeon and patient preference.\nIn the regional anesthetic group the indications for operation included transient ischemic attack (311), asymptomatic hemodynamically significant stenosis (146), amaurosis fugax (106), stroke (86), restenosis (3), and aneurysm (2). Shunts were used in 46 of 654 cases (7%). Conversion from regional to general anesthetic was required in seven patients (1.1%). The operative mortality rate was 0.76% (5 of 654). Permanent nonfatal neurologic deficits occurred in 0.76% (5 of 654), and temporary neurologic deficits occurred in 1.07% (7 of 654).\nOn the basis of these results, we believe regional cervical block anesthetic is an acceptable option to the routine use of shunts performed with the patient receiving general anesthetic during carotid endarterectomy. In addition, the ability to continuously assess the awake patient receiving cervical block may contribute to a decrease in perioperative stroke and mortality rates while simplifying functional cerebral monitoring during carotid endarterectomy.",

In this study, we report the incidence of this complication and describe its clinical presentation, cause, and natural history.\nBetween 1988 and 1993, 9585 cardiac catheterizations were performed at this institution. Patients in whom femoral neuropathy developed were identified through a cardiology registry. Hospital and outpatient records and personal interviews were used to determine the presentation and clinical course of each of these patients.\nPeripheral neuropathy developed in 20 patients (incidence = 0.21%). Two clinical patterns emerged. In 16 patients, large retroperitoneal hematomas were documented by either computed tomography scanning or by physical examination. These patients were admitted with a lumbar plexopathy involving the femoral, obturator, or lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. Long-term follow-up revealed persistent mild sensory neuropathy in five patients and a mild motor deficit in one. In four patients a groin hematoma or false aneurysm developed which resulted, in paresthesias involving the medial and intermediate cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve. Symptoms completely resolved in all four patients, although false aneurysms were surgically repaired in two.\nNeuropathy after cardiac catheterization can be initially disabling, but it is usually completely reversible. Operation is recommended only for coexisting complications.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive tests for the evaluation of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) include quantitative photoplethysmography (QPG), air plethysmography, and duplex ultrasonography measurement of valve closure time (VCT). These tests have been shown to accurately identify the presence of CVI, define the disease, and locate the involved segments. However, the correlation of noninvasive assessment of CVI with the clinical severity (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery staging) has not been addressed critically.\nDuring an 18-month period, 74 limbs were prospectively evaluated with clinical examination, air plethysmography, QPG and duplex ultrasonography.\nWe studied 52 patients with a mean age of 46 years. There were 14 stage 0 limbs, 14 stage 1, 15 stage 2, and 31 stage 3. We found significant differences (p < 0.05) between normal limbs and those with CVI only by VCT and QPG. There were also marked trends toward worsening mean values for reflux (VCT, QPG, and venous filling index) and venous hypertension (residual volume fraction) between stages 0 to 1, and 1 to 2; however, there was a large degree of overlap between all groups. No test discriminated stage 2 from 3. Assessment of calf muscle pump function with ejection fraction showed no difference between any groups.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery criteria for CVI staging distinguishes ulcerated limbs (stage 3) from those with nonulcerating skin changes (hyperpigmentation, brawny edema, and subcutaneous fibrosis) (stage 2). However, we were not able to distinguish these groups by available noninvasive methods. This may imply that these tests are not accurate enough or that the progression from lipodermatosclerosis to frank ulceration is not accounted for by large-vessel hemodynamic changes, but rather by microcirculatory alterations.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty occurs in more than 40% of patients. Angiopeptin, a stable synthetic octapeptide analogue of somatostatin, attenuates accelerated coronary artery myointimal thickening in rabbit cardiac allografts and myointimal thickening after arterial injury. In this study the temporal relationship between the angiopeptin treatment schedule and efficacy was explored. The relationship between inhibition of myointimal thickening by angiopeptin and inhibition of vascular cell proliferation was also examined.\nThe aorta and the common and external iliac arteries of the rabbit underwent balloon injury. Angiopeptin (2 to 200 micrograms/kg/day) was administered for 1 day before injury and for 1, 5, and 21 days after injury. Morphometric studies were performed to determine measurement of intimal thickening. Inhibition of vascular cell proliferation by angiopeptin was evaluated by tritiated thymidine incorporation into the balloon-injured rabbit aorta. Thymidine was either administered intraperitoneally or added ex vivo to aorta segments of rabbits treated with angiopeptin (2, 20, or 200 micrograms/kg/day) from 1 day before injury until sacrifice 72 hours later.\nAdministration of angiopeptin (2 to 200 micrograms/kg/day) significantly reduced intimal thickening by approximately 50% in all three vessels when evaluated 3 weeks after injury. This inhibitory effect was unrelated to duration of treatment and dose. Treatment initiated at the time of injury was found to be effective, but delaying treatment for 8, 18, or 27 hours abrogated the inhibitory effect of angiopeptin on myointimal thickening. Angiopeptin treatment significantly decreased thymidine-labeled nuclei of smooth muscle cells in vitro. Angiopeptin treatment similarly inhibited thymidine uptake in vitro by balloon-injured aorta segments.\nAngiopeptin significantly inhibits myointimal thickening by inhibiting vascular cell proliferation. Administration of angiopeptin for 2 days is as efficacious as 3 weeks treatment in inhibiting myointimal thickening. Delaying treatment for as little as 8 hours after injury abrogates the inhibitory effects of angiopeptin. This speaks to the importance of early events immediately after vascular tissue injury, suggesting that angiopeptin inhibits the expression of early genes causally related to the vascular injury response and thereby triggering vascular cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Traditional surgical treatment for panprosthetic aortic graft infection entails radical excision of the graft, aortic stump closure, and extraanatomic revascularization of the lower limbs. This carries an early mortality rate of 24% to 45%. Amputation rates range from 11% to 37%. Multiple operations and prolonged hospital stay are usual. We have developed a more conservative management technique with the aim of improving outcome.\nWe describe an innovative method of treating the condition with prolonged, high-dose, local antibiotic irrigation therapy, systemic antibiotic treatment, surgical debridement, and graft conservation in a prospectively studied series of 10 patients.\nThe actual 30-day patient survival rate is 90%, the 1-year survival rate is 80%, and the 4-year survival rate is 67%. Two patients died because of graft infection, and the third died, uninfected, of an unrelated cause. No limbs have been amputated. Only two patients required a second operation. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 32 days. The seven survivors have been closely followed up with regular computed tomography or indium scanning and clinical examination and appear to be free from infection at a mean of 61 months after cessation of irrigation therapy.\nThe technique appears to represent a significant improvement in the management of this major complication of vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Among various surgical techniques for renal artery reconstruction (RAR), anatomic aortorenal bypass has been the preferred standard. Yet concern regarding origin of the bypass from a diseased aorta and desire to avoid a major aortic operation in these patients who are often at poor risk has led to increasing use of extraanatomic bypass grafting, particularly hepatorenal and splenorenal bypass. This study was conducted to compare the safety and long-term performance of these different techniques of renal artery reconstruction.\nWe reviewed a 15-year (1976 to 1991) experience with 323 surgical RAR performed in 285 patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease. Long-term patency and survival rates were analyzed by life-table methods. Variables potentially affecting early failure of the RAR and perioperative and late mortality rates were examined by Cox proportional hazards models.\nDiffuse atherosclerosis characterized the patients' clinical profile. Clinically evident coronary artery disease was present in 54% of patients, and some degree of renal insufficiency was present in 60%. Ninety-five percent of patients had hypertension with poor control of hypertension seen in 50%. Aortic disease necessitated combined aortic grafting and RAR in 43% of the study group. Various techniques of RAR were used as follows: endarterectomy or patch angioplasty, 8.5%; extraanatomic bypass grafting, 37% (hepatorenal, 62; splenorenal, 52; iliorenal, 7); and aortorenal bypass grafting, 54% (native aorta, 34; combined aortic graft and RAR, 140). Early failure of the RAR occurred in 5% of cases, and the operative mortality rate for the entire cohort was 5.6%. Median follow-up duration was 9.4 years. A comparison of early and late patency for the major types of RAR revealed equivalent (p = 0.44) performance of aortorenal and extraanatomic bypass grafting. Perioperative complications occurred more frequently (p < 0.02) in patients undergoing combined operations. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for all patients was 75%.\nBecause extraanatomic bypass grafting can provide long-term results equivalent to aortorenal bypass grafting, the choice among techniques for RAR in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis should be based on both technical and operative safety considerations, rather than adherence to aortorenal bypass grafting as an inherently superior technique.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the preoperative factors that are predictive of prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) and to discuss strategies that might assist in minimizing LOS for this select group of patients.\nTwo hundred seventy-five arterial bypass procedures with the in situ technique were performed between 1986 and 1993. The relationship between 14 preoperative variables and hospital LOS was analyzed with both univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox regression) statistical techniques. A model was developed to determine the significant preoperative variables that were associated with prolonged LOS.\nThe primary and secondary patency rates and limb salvage rates at 4 years were 73.3% +/- 3.2%, 78.9% +/- 2.9%, and 81.9% +/- 3.2%, respectively. The median postoperative LOS was 15 days, with a mean +/- SD of 17.8 +/- 12.3 days (range 4 to 93 days). With Cox regression analysis, the variables that were significant predictors of LOS (with a model p value < 0.002) were age (greater than 74 years vs less than 75), history of cerebrovascular disease (transient ischemic attack, stroke, past carotid endarterectomy vs nil), and operative indication (limb salvage vs disabling claudication).\nThis study illustrates that certain preoperative variables are predictive of prolonged postoperative LOS after in situ bypass. The significant preoperative factors identified should be used to direct specific care and discharge planning for these individuals.",

    "abstract": "The absence of sufficient length of suitable autologous vein occasionally prohibits the treatment of severe distal lower extremity arterial occlusive disease with a standard distal bypass originating from the common femoral artery. During the past 11 years, we have therefore selectively performed short distal bypasses originating from the infrapopliteal arteries in patients with limb-threatening ischemia and occlusive lesions limited to the distal tibial and peroneal arteries. This report summarizes our experience with these tibial artery based distal bypasses.\nForty-two distal lower extremity arterial bypasses originating from infrapopliteal arteries in 41 patients were performed over an 11-year period. Autologous vein was used as the bypass conduit in all cases. Extensions from a more proximal bypass were excluded.\nThe primary patency rate of these tibiotibial bypasses was 77% at 1 year and 62% after 5 years. The limb salvage rate after 5 years was 74%. The perioperative mortality rate was low (2%), but the 5-year patient survival rate (64%) was similar to that with more standard lower extremity arterial reconstructive procedures.\nTibiotibial bypass is an effective limb salvage procedure in carefully selected patients with distal tibial artery occlusive disease and limited autologous vein. It offers a durable means of distal revascularization in circumstances in which a standard operation might not be desirable or possible.",

Uniaxial tensile stress tests were carried out on a tensile-testing machine, and a stress-strain curve was plotted for each sample to study the mechanical properties of AAAs. The curves were fitted exponentially so sigma = aeb epsilon, where sigma is stress, epsilon is strain, and a and b are parameters.\nIn aneurysms (n = 8) the volume fraction of elastin was decreased from 22.7% +/- 5.7% to 2.4% +/- 2.2%, and the volume fraction of smooth muscle cells was decreased from 22.6% +/- 5.5% to 2.2% +/- 2.0%, whereas the volume fraction of collagen and ground substance combined was increased from 54.8% +/- 4.5% to 95.6% +/- 2.5% compared with nonaneurysmal aortas (n = 8). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the ratio of collagen to ground substance (2.1 +/- 0.5 vs 2.0 +/- 0.4) between AAAs and nonaneurysmal aortas.

    "abstract": "Perfusion of the isolated aorta of the rat with a saline solution containing pancreatic elastase induces an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An interesting feature of this model is the phenomenon of latency, suggesting that additional steps beyond the initial injury are required for AAA formation. This study was performed to determine whether the latency period for aortic dilation to aneurysmal proportions is correlated with the appearance of proteinases of endogenous origin and the interval for infiltration of inflammatory cells.\nTwenty Wistar rat aortas were perfused with the test solution, and 20 with normal saline solution. Laparotomy was performed on days 1, 2, 3, and 6 for measurement and harvest of the aorta. Histochemical studies were performed to analyze changes in matrix proteins, and substrate gel enzymography was used to determine the appearance of endogenous proteinases. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with monoclonal antibodies to T cells (CD-4, -5, and -8), monocytes/macrophages (ED-2), B cells (LC-A), immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M.\nThe exogenously administered elastase was not detectable beyond day 2, but the aortic diameter did not progress to aneurysmal dimensions until the interval between days 3 and 6. During the period from day 3 to day 6, multiple endogenous matrix proteinases became detectable in the aortic tissue preparations. Immunohistochemical study revealed progressive infiltration of the aorta with various subsets of inflammatory cells.\nThe results suggest that the latency in AAA formation in this model corresponds with a complex sequence of biochemical and cellular events. The model provides an \"early window\" into these interesting early phases leading to aneurysm formation.",

    "abstract": "The structure of infrarenal aortic aneurysm was studied as a basis for design of a transfemoral system of aneurysm repair. This information was particularly important because endovascular techniques, unlike conventional techniques, afford little opportunity for intraoperative adjustments.\nThree-dimensional computer reconstructions of the distal aorta, the renal arteries, the aneurysm and the iliac arteries were generated from computed tomography scanning data in 22 patients with aortic aneurysms.\nThe proximal neck of the aneurysm was longer than 20 mm in 14 patients, and the mean length (of all 22) was 26.7 +/- 4.1 mm. In contrast, only one patient had a distal cuff longer than 20 mm and 14 of the others had no measurable distal cuff. The mean distal cuff length (of all 22) was 4.2 +/- 1.6 mm. There was no significant difference between mean aneurysm diameter in the anteroposterior direction (58.0 +/- 3.2 mm) and the transverse direction (56.4 +/- 3.3 mm), although corresponding values in individual patients were often different. Aneurysm diameter correlated with aneurysm length (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). The proximal right common iliac artery deviated from the axis of the distal aorta by 40.0 +/- 5.8 degrees, whereas the left deviated by 47.8 +/- 5.4 degrees. One of the iliac arteries deviated by more than 45 degrees in 12 cases. Eleven common iliac arteries in seven patients were aneurysmal. Fifteen patients had no aneurysm of the common iliac arteries, and another three had segments of nondilated common iliac artery distal to iliac aneurysms on both sides.\nComputerized three-dimensional reconstruction facilitated interpretation of anatomic information from computed tomography scans, particularly the length of the aneurysm neck and shape of the iliac arteries. On the basis of this information, we expect that few patients will have too short an aneurysm neck for endovascular aneurysm repair, but many will require a bifurcated graft for secure, hemostatic implantation distally.",

    "abstract": "Although gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde glue has been used to treat acute aortic dissections for some time, concerns about formaldehyde's mutagenicity and carcinogenicity made it imperative to develop a new glue compound. Gelatin-dialdehyde glue was produced by omitting the formaldehyde component and replacing it with two less toxic aldehydes, glutaraldehyde and glyoxal. This study evaluated the histomorphologic effects of the new glue through in vivo use on the aortic tissue of domestic pigs.\nEach animal's infrarenal aorta was glued around an implanted prosthesis. Histomorphologic evaluation was performed after operation after 1 and 4 weeks.\nThe results demonstrated that the clinically observed tanning effect can be attributed primarily to the disintegration of the fiber texture, specifically collagenous, as well as smooth muscle fibers, and to the reciprocal alterations of the proteoglycan interstitial substance in the aortic wall. Macroscopic, microscopic, and electron microscopic analysis of the gluing process revealed an adequate healing process without any morphologically significant difference between formaldehyde and formaldehyde-free gelatin-resorcinol glue.\nGelatin-dialdehyde glue is able to produce the same effects in the area of the aortic wall as the substantially more toxic gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde glue and thus could be recommended for clinical trials for treating acute aortic dissections thus far yielding excellent initial results.",

    "abstract": "Both midline and transverse abdominal incisions are used for exposing the infrarenal aorta. Transverse incisions are said to cause less pulmonary and systemic complications, but the claimed advantages may be because most transverse incisions are extraperitoneal, whereas midline incisions are intraperitoneal. This study compares intraperitoneal transverse and midline incisions with respect to perioperative and late complications, especially incisional hernia.\nThree hundred twenty-nine patients undergoing infrarenal aortic reconstruction (239 aneurysms; 90 occlusive disease) were analyzed retrospectively according to whether the abdominal wall incision was midline (154 patients) or transverse (175 patients). In all patients, the subsequent dissection was transperitoneal and not retroperitoneal.\nPerioperative survival rates and intraoperative blood loss were comparable, but the transverse incision tended to be followed by a shorter period of postoperative ileus (p = 0.07), perhaps because the small bowel was not always exteriorized during operation with transverse incisions. Mean time spent in the intensive care unit was not different between the groups, but those with transverse incisions remained in hospital 5 days less than those receiving midline incisions (p = 0.0005). When an aortic graft greater than 18 mm in diameter was used, survival was reduced compared with that after smaller grafts (p = 0.028). At 1 to 6 years follow-up in 235 patients (109 midline; 126 transverse), 35 (14.9%) incisional hernias were detected, with no statistical difference according to incision (16.5% midline; 13.4% transverse). Analysis by univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that blood loss at operation exceeding 1000 ml increased the risk of later incisional hernia by a factor of 3.07. Wound infection increased the risk of hernia by 3.70.\nExcess blood loss and wound infection exerted this predisposition to incisional herniation independent of other variables.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in many cases leads to chronic symptoms in the damaged leg, even though the affected veins have recanalized. The major hemodynamic defect in such recanalized veins is reflux. The incidence and extent of reflux has been studied in patients with proven DVT and correlated with concurrent symptoms.\nTwo hundred seventeen limbs in 183 patients were examined by duplex scanning from January 1989 to October 1992. All limbs had previous DVT diagnosed by venography. Sites and extent (proximal, distal, or both) of reflux were identified by meticulous duplex scanning of the whole venous system and correlated with presenting symptoms.\nThe patients were classified into nine groups on the basis of the classification of the system involved (superficial, deep, or superficial and deep) and whether the reflux was found proximal or distal to the knee or both. Eight-one limbs belong to chronic venous insufficiency class 1, 92 belong to class 2, and 38 belong to class 3. Reflux was confined to the deep venous system in 84 limbs (38.7%), to the superficial system in 31 (14.3%) limbs, and to both systems in 102 (47%) limbs. It was confined to proximal veins only in 48 (22.1%) limbs, distal only in 56 (25.8%) limbs and throughout the limb in 113 (52.1%) limbs. The incidence of swelling was increased by distal or a combination of proximal and distal reflux regardless of which system was involved. In limbs with superficial venous insufficiency (SVI) or deep venous insufficiency (DVI) only, the incidence of skin changes was not affected by the extent of reflux. However, in limbs with combined SVI and DVI, it was increased in the presence of reflux throughout the limb. Absence of distal reflux was associated with a low incidence of skin changes even in the presence of DVI. Ulceration increased with an increased extent of reflux in the presence of SVI. Absence of superficial reflux was associated with a low incidence, even in the presence of DVI.\nThe data suggest that as far as the skin changes and ulceration are concerned, distal reflux and reflux in the superficial veins are more harmful than reflux confined to the deep veins, even when such reflux extends throughout the deep venous system.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to compare the epidemiologic and clinical features of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in black patients and white patients.\nData on all patients identified with 50% or greater RAS from 1984 to 1990 were collected and analyzed. The study was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, which is a referral center for patients with renal artery disease. Eight hundred nineteen patients with RAS were identified from an institutional registry that records information on patients with this disease. This group comprises 40 black patients (4.9%) and 779 white patients (95.1%). The presence of RAS was determined by abdominal aortography in all patients. Black patients and white patients with RAS were compared with respect to their age, sex, presence and severity of hypertension, renal function, type and extent of renal artery disease, extrarenal vascular disease, and risk factors such as history of smoking, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.\nThe mean age of black patients and white patients was 62 years; however, a greater proportion of black patients were women (p = 0.01). RAS was due to atherosclerosis in 95% and 92% of blacks and whites, respectively. Although the extent and severity of RAS were equivalent in black patients and white patients, more blacks were diagnosed with severe (p = 0.01) or refractory (p = 0.05) hypertension. Extrarenal vascular disease was present in 95% and 70% of blacks and whites, respectively (p < 0.01). The incidence of coronary artery disease (p < 0.01), cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.01), and peripheral vascular disease (p < 0.01) was greater among black patients. A history of smoking was more common among black patients (p < 0.01). Serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were equivalent among black patients and white patients; however, black patients had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.03) and lower triglyceride (p < 0.01) levels.\nThere are significant differences between black patients and white patients with RAS. The basis for these findings and their relationship to the cause and true prevalence of RAS in blacks requires further study.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the feasibility of achieving regional hypothermia of the spinal cord with an infusion of iced (4 degrees C) saline solution administered into an epidural catheter while monitoring cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) temperature in eight patients undergoing thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection.\nAs part of the anesthetic management, an epidural catheter was placed at T11-12, and a subarachnoid thermistor catheter was placed at L3-4. Approximately 30 minutes before aortic cross-clamping, iced (4 degrees C) saline solution was infused into the epidural catheter until CSF temperature decreased to approximately 25 degrees C. The infusion was then adjusted to maintain this temperature until the aorta was unclamped. The subarachnoid catheter was also used to measure CSF pressure and provide for CSF drainage. Surgery was performed in all patients with a clamp-and-sew technique with selective intercostal vessel reattachment.\nInfusion of a mean volume of 489 ml (range 80 to 1700 ml) of iced saline solution into the epidural space before aortic cross-clamping led to a decrease in mean CSF temperature to 26.9 degrees C (range 25 degrees to 28.8 degrees C) in 15 to 90 minutes. During cross-clamping and aortic replacement the mean CSF temperature was maintained between 25.2 degrees to 27.6 degrees C and, with discontinuation of the infusion, returned to within 1 degrees C of body core temperature by the end of the procedure. Body core temperature was not significantly affected by the epidural infusion. Mean CSF pressure increased during the epidural infusion but could be reduced by removing saline solution from the epidural space. No postoperative neurologic deficits were observed.\nEpidural cooling appears to be a satisfactory method of achieving regional spinal cord hypothermia in patients requiring resection of thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.",

Forty-two CEs were performed within 30 days (early group, ranging 3 to 30 days), and 58 were performed beyond 30 days (delayed group, range 33 to 117 days) after stroke. The risk of subsequent stroke after CE was compared between the two groups.\nBaseline clinical characteristics were comparable in both the early and delayed groups. In the delayed group more lesions were identified ipsilateral to the symptomatic side on the preoperative computed tomography scans. The postoperative (30 days after endarterectomy) stroke rate was 4.8% in the early group and 5.2% in the delayed group, yielding a relative rate of 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 5.27; p = 1.00). No deaths occurred after operation in either group. At the end of 18 months, the rates of any stroke or death were 11.9% and 10.3% for the early and delayed groups, respectively, resulting in a relative rate of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.38 to 3.52; p = 1.00). No association was found between an abnormal preoperative computed tomography scan result and the subsequent risk of stroke when early operation was used.\nEarly CE for severe carotid artery stenosis after a nondisabling ischemic stroke can be performed with rates of morbidity and mortality comparable to those who receive delayed endarterectomy. Delaying the procedure by 30 days for patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis exposes them to a risk of a recurrent stroke, which may be avoidable by earlier surgery.",

One aortoiliac, one iliorenal, two iliofemoral, three femorofemoral, one femoroperoneal, and eight femoropopliteal grafts were used in this particular group of patients. The arteries were retrieved from a donor whose diagnosis was cerebral death and, after careful preliminary studies, were stored cold, with use of liquid nitroxide vapor.\nThe patients were monitored up to 45 months, mean 20 months. Graft tolerance was good, there were no signs or symptoms of acute rejection, and there was no perturbation of the immunologic tolerance of the transplanted kidney. During the follow-up period, two grafts occluded. On the basis of the histologic studies, it was not possible to relate the occlusion to rejection.\nThis clinical study, undertaken for the first time in human beings, seems to confirm that immunosuppression modifies host tolerance to arterial allografts, improving their biologic behavior, a fact that was already documented in animal experimentation.",

    "abstract": "The North American and the European Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial investigators reported a conclusive benefit of carotid endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic 70% to 99% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. However, it has been suggested that plaque structure may be an even more important factor in producing stroke than the degree of stenosis. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the ultrasonic characteristics of carotid artery plaques were closely related to symptoms and to the prevalence of cerebral infarcts on computed tomography (CT).\nOne hundred five carotid artery plaques causing greater than 70% stenosis in the ICA in 83 consecutive patients who underwent brain CT were characterized into four ultrasonic types: echolucent plaques, predominantly echolucent plaques, predominantly echogenic plaques, and echogenic plaques. Patients with permanent neurologic deficit were excluded.\nThere was a significant ipsilateral association between type 1 plaques and symptomatic hemispheres (p < 0.002). Twenty-six of the 105 cerebral hemispheres assessed by CT had infarcts. There was an increased incidence of brain infarcts in type I plaques (37%) compared with 18% in types II, III, and IV combined (p < 0.02).\nOur results support the hypothesis that echolucent plaques are more frequently associated with symptoms and cerebral infarctions and provide further evidence that these plaques are unstable and tend to embolize. Studies on the natural history of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis should investigate whether plaque characterization could identify a high-risk group.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to study the influence of either reattachment or oversewing of patient segmental intercostal or lumbar arteries, extent of aneurysm, and atriofemoral bypass on the incidence of postoperative paraplegia/paraparesis in patients at high risk with type I or II thoracoabdominal aneurysms.\nData were prospectively collected on 99 patients undergoing type I or II thoracoabdominal aneurysm repairs, including exact extent of repair and whether atriofemoral bypass ws used. Patency of intercostal arteries from T3 to T12 and lumbar arteries from L1 to L4 were checked by intraoperative inspection. If the arteries were patent, note was taken of whether they were reattached to the new aortic prosthesis. Postoperative neurologic motor function was graded daily for the first 5 days, and the worst score in the first 30 postoperative days (POD) was used for analysis.\nNinety-five of 99 (96%) patients were 30-day survivors. By POD 30, 31 of 98 (32%) patients had had a neurologic deficit. There was no difference in the incidence of deficits according to whether lumbar or intercostal arteries were reattached, ignoring the effect of patency of the arteries. Of greater importance, however, was whether patent segmental arteries were oversewn at specific levels. Thus, for patients who had one or more arteries at T11, T12, or L1 oversewn (often because they could not be reattached), a deficit developed in 11 of 23 (48%) patients versus 20 of 75 (27%) patients who did not have patent arteries or had all patient arteries reattached (p = 0.05, odds ratio = 2.5). More specifically, if all arteries at this level were oversewn, a neurologic deficit developed in 63% of patients versus 23% if all their arteries were reattached (p = 0.01). Reattachment of patent arteries at individual levels from T7 to L4 showed a trend toward a lower risk of deficits but did not reach statistical significance. On multivariate analysis, atriofemoral bypass was associated with a lower risk of paralysis (p = 0.068), and significantly so when controlled for age (p = 0.0329, odds ratio 0.287). Subgrouping of extent type I thoracoabdominal aneurysms resulted in an incidence of paralysis of 14% (3/22) for subgroup A and 23% (5 of 22) for subgroup B compared with 43% (23 of 55) for type II thoracoabdominal aneurysms (type I [8 of 44 18%], versus type II [p = 0.0097]).\nPatients with no or few patent segmental arteries in the aortic segment being replaced have a lower risk of neurologic deficits, compared with those with patent arteries. Every effort should be made to reattach all arteries at T11, T12, and L1 and, when possible within the constraints of technical feasibility and time, also those from T7 to L4. Preoperative angiography or intraoperative hydrogen testing may better identify the arteries that need to be reattached. When feasible, atriofemoral bypass appears to be protective, particularly when sequential clamping and segmental repairs can be performed.",

    "results": "Ninety-five of 99 (96%) patients were 30-day survivors. By POD 30, 31 of 98 (32%) patients had had a neurologic deficit. There was no difference in the incidence of deficits according to whether lumbar or intercostal arteries were reattached, ignoring the effect of patency of the arteries. Of greater importance, however, was whether patent segmental arteries were oversewn at specific levels. Thus, for patients who had one or more arteries at T11, T12, or L1 oversewn (often because they could not be reattached), a deficit developed in 11 of 23 (48%) patients versus 20 of 75 (27%) patients who did not have patent arteries or had all patient arteries reattached (p = 0.05, odds ratio = 2.5). More specifically, if all arteries at this level were oversewn, a neurologic deficit developed in 63% of patients versus 23% if all their arteries were reattached (p = 0.01). Reattachment of patent arteries at individual levels from T7 to L4 showed a trend toward a lower risk of deficits but did not reach statistical significance. On multivariate analysis, atriofemoral bypass was associated with a lower risk of paralysis (p = 0.068), and significantly so when controlled for age (p = 0.0329, odds ratio 0.287). Subgrouping of extent type I thoracoabdominal aneurysms resulted in an incidence of paralysis of 14% (3/22) for subgroup A and 23% (5 of 22) for subgroup B compared with 43% (23 of 55) for type II thoracoabdominal aneurysms (type I [8 of 44 18%], versus type II [p = 0.0097]).",

    "abstract": "Occlusive iliofemoral venous thrombosis is associated with morbid short- and long-term consequences. Having been disappointed with standard anticoagulant therapy and systemic fibrinolysis, we embarked on an aggressive multidisciplinary regional approach to treat these patients, with the goals of therapy being (1) to eliminate iliofemoral venous thrombus, (2) to provide unobstructed venous drainage from the affected limb, and (3) to prevent recurrent thrombosis.\nTwelve consecutive patients were treated for extensive iliofemoral venous thrombosis. Each had thrombus from their infrapopliteal veins through their iliofemoral system, and four had vena caval involvement. The conditions of 11 patients failed to improve when the patients were given anticoagulants, and prior systemic fibrinolysis failed in five patients. The treatment strategy includes catheter-directed thrombolysis with intrathrombus infusion of the plasminogen activator or operative thrombectomy or venous bypass with a permanent 4 mm arteriovenous fistula (AVF).\nNine of 12 patients had a good or excellent clinical outcome (mean follow-up 25 months), which correlated with restored unobstructed venous drainage from the affected limb. Seven patients had catheter-directed lytic therapy attempted. In five patients the catheters were appropriately positioned, and lysis was successful. Five of the eight patients who underwent operations had successful procedures. Two of the three patients with poor operative outcomes had residual thrombus in their iliac veins or vena cava after thrombectomy (without bypass). The third patient, in whom anticoagulation was contraindicated, had an initially successful thrombectomy and AVF; however, vena caval thrombosis developed 2 months after operation. No patient had symptomatic pulmonary emboli, and routine posttreatment ventilation/perfusion lung scanning was not performed.\nAn aggressive multidisciplinary regional approach to patients with obliterative iliofemoral venous thrombosis, designed to remove thrombus and provide unobstructed venous drainage, offers substantially better clinical outcome compared with systemic fibrinolysis and standard anticoagulation. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is successful if the catheter is appropriately positioned within the thrombus. Contemporary venous thrombectomy, which includes thrombus removal, completion phlebography, AVF, and cross-pubic bypass when necessary, is associated with high success rates. Failures can be anticipated and avoided in most patients.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported the possible role of human cytomegalovirus in the pathogenesis of inflammatory aortic diseases. To further analyze the viral cause of human aortic diseases, in this study we examined the presence and the replication of human Herpesviridae in 60 aortic tissues, including 7 inflammatory aneurysms, 37 atherosclerotic aneurysms, and 16 normal aortas.\nTo detect the genome of herpes simplex virus (type 1, type 2), cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus, DNA polymerase chain reaction for each virus was performed. To analyze these herpesviral replications, the viral transcript was detected with RNA polymerase chain reaction.\nThe DNA polymerase chain reaction showed that either herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus was present more frequently in inflammatory (29% or 86%, respectively) and atherosclerotic aneurysms (27% or 65%, respectively) than in normal aortic tissues (6% or 31%, respectively), whereas the Epstein-Barr viral genome was not detected in any aortic tissue specimens. By the use of RNA polymerase chain reaction, only the cytomegaloviral transcript was recognized in 71% of the inflammatory aneurysms but was not recognized in any other tissue specimens. No other herpesviral transcripts were detected in any tissue specimens examined in this study.\nOur results thus suggest that the human herpesviruses may play various roles in the pathogenicity of aortic diseases, in particular the replicating infections of the cytomegalovirus might potentially cause the formation of inflammatory aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative duplex venous mapping is the preferred modality to measure the diameter of the greater saphenous vein and its suitability as an arterial conduit for infrainguinal bypass. We wanted to determine the optimal mapping technique and maximal venous diameter in patients with and without atherosclerosis.\nThree groups of patients were prospectively studied: younger control subjects (n = 20), preoperative atherosclerotic patients (n = 10), and older control subjects (n = 10). All patients underwent greater saphenous vein duplex mapping in a standardized manner. Maximal internal vein diameters were measured with the subjects in the supine position in bed, in the 20 degree reversed Trendelenburg position, sitting on the edge of the bed, standing, and in the supine position with a high-thigh, low-pressure tourniquet. Measurements were taken just beyond the saphenofemoral junction, in the distal thigh, below the knee, at midcalf, and superior to the medial malleolus.\nIn younger control subjects an increasingly more erect position resulted in progressively larger measured vein diameters at all levels along the length of the leg. Both patients with atherosclerosis and older control subjects had no such increase in venous diameter with any positional change from the supine position to standing. Patients with atherosclerosis also had significantly smaller measured veins than either younger or older control subjects. A high-thigh tourniquet significantly increased vein diameters in the atherosclerotic group to the size of vein diameters in the older control group, although the absolute size differences were not large.\nThe optimal position for venous mapping is with the patient in a supine position. If the internal vein diameter is below an acceptable minimum size, a high-thigh tourniquet will maximally distend the vein in patients with atherosclerosis. Vein diameter decreases with age and is less distended in patients with atherosclerosis compared with older patients without atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Vascular disease is differentiated throughout the vascular regions, with central arteries more prone to dilation and with peripheral arteries more prone to occlusive disease. In this study we investigated the diameter and compliance in the common carotid artery and abdominal aorta in healthy males at varying ages to assess potential differences in the aging process.\nAn ultrasound phase-locked echo-tracking system was used to determine differences in diameter and pulsatile diameter changes of the common carotid artery and abdominal aorta in 56 healthy Caucasian males ages 10 to 74 years. Pressure strain elastic modulus (Ep) and stiffness (beta) were calculated from diameter, pulsatile diameter change, and blood pressure obtained by the auscultatory method. Compliance was defined as the inverse of Ep and stiffness.\nThe diameter of both common carotid artery and abdominal aorta increases not only when a person is a child, but also when they are between 25 and 70 years old. The dilation in adults seems to be more accentuated in the abdominal aorta (27%) than in the common carotid artery (17%). Ep and stiffness (beta) are higher in the common carotid artery when a person is 10 years of age (p < 0.01 and 0.05). However, during aging, Ep and stiffness (beta) increase to a higher extent in the aorta than in the common carotid artery, with a significantly higher Ep and stiffness (beta) in the aorta when a person is 45 years and older (45 years: p < 0.05 and p = NS; 60 years: p < 0.001 and p < 0.001; 70 years: p < 0.01 and p < 0.01).\nThis investigation demonstrates regional differences in diameter change and compliance in the common carotid artery and abdominal aorta and implies that the abdominal aorta is more prone to degenerative changes than the common carotid artery. This may be one etiologic factor for the regional differences in vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Perigraft seroma is a rare complication of reconstructive vascular surgery characterized by a clear, sterile fluid collection confined within a fibrous pseudomembrane around a prosthetic graft. The exact cause of this disease is unknown but involves failure of surrounding connective tissue to incorporate the graft. To understand why this occurs, we studied sera from patients with perigraft seroma for their effect on human fibroblasts. Sera from control subjects, patients with uninfected prosthetic grafts, and patients with prosthetic grafts were tested for comparison.\nFibroblast growth was measured by radioactive thymidine uptake and hexosaminidase colorimetric cell proliferation assays. We fractionated sera with gel filtration columns and measured each fraction's effect on fibroblast growth.\nSerum samples from patients with perigraft seroma inhibited fibroblast growth in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, a postseroma sample, normal human sera, and sera from patients with infected and uninfected grafts showed no significant fibroblast inhibition. An inhibitory factor with a molecular weight of 2000 d was isolated from serum of patients with perigraft seroma.\nPerigraft seroma is associated with a fibroblast inhibitor with a molecular weight of 2000 d. Further identification and characterization of this protein may lead to clinical applications in preventing and treating perigraft seroma.",

    "abstract": "The procedure of axillofemoral bypass (AXF) grafting has generally been used in the past for patients with serious contraindication to certain reconstructive procedures involving the abdominal aorta. Because some recent series have noted improved results, it has been suggested that the indications for this bypass may be extended. We reviewed our experience with AXF to identify which factors affect outcome, to determine whether recent results have improved, and to determine whether an extension of the use of the procedure is justified by the observed results.\nOne hundred fifty-three AXF, including 80 axillobifemoral bypasses and 73 axillounifemoral bypasses performed between October 1974 and December 1992 were reviewed.\nThree-year primary and secondary patency rates for the entire group were 49.4% and 65.7%. Primary patency was adversely affected (p < 0.05) by superficial femoral artery occlusion, use of externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene, distal endarterectomy, distal anastomosis to the deep femoral artery, and year of surgery after 1984, but not by use of unifemoral or bifemoral outflow, side of graft origin, or concomitant distal procedure. The operative mortality rate of bypasses performed for claudication and the limb salvage rate was 8.3% overall and 5.9% after 1984. Limb salvage rates were 74.8% and 74.8% at 3 and 5 years. The patient survival rate for all AXF was 55.8% and 39.2% at 3 and 5 years. AXF for acute ischemia carried a high rate of mortality and limb loss.\nBifemoral outflow, external support, and more recent surgery were not associated with improved patency rates. Our results do not support extended indications for AXF.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that propranolol has unique effects that slow aneurysm expansion by remodeling the structural proteins of the aorta. These effects are believed to be independent of blood pressure reduction, a hypothesis we tested in this investigation with a rat model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nWith an established model, AAA were induced in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and genetically hypertensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKHT) rats by perfusing an isolated segment of the infrarenal aorta with elastase. A propranolol dose-response was studied for each strain: (1) saline solution controls (n = 18); (2) propranolol, 10 mg/kg subcutaneously (n = 18); (3) propranolol, 30 mg/kg (n = 14). Systolic blood pressure was determined by tail plethysmography before operation and on day 14, as well as by direct recording at surgery and on day 14. Rats were killed at 14 days, and aneurysm diameter was measured.\nThe initial tail BP was 129 +/- 22 mm Hg in WKY animals and 158 +/- 21 mm Hg in WKHT animals (p < 0.0001). Tail BP and intraaortic systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (BP) were not significantly decreased by propranolol treatment in either strain of rats. However, BP tended to rise in WKY rats, whereas it fell slightly in WKHT rats. Initial aortic size in all animals was 1.06 +/- 0.12. The final aortic size in untreated, hypertensive rats was more than twice that of untreated normotensive controls: 1: WKHT, 3.0 +/- 0.73 mm, 1: WKY, 6.9 +/- 3.5 mm (p < 0.01). After treatment with both doses of propranolol, hypertensive aneurysms were significantly smaller than the untreated WKHT group (p < 0.05) and not significantly different from aneurysms in all groups of normotensive animals: 2: WKY, 3.1 +/- 1.13 mm, 2: WKHT, 4.0 +/- 1.81 mm; 3: WKY, 4.1 +/- 0.41 mm, 3: WKHT, 2.9 +/- 1.24 mm. There was no significant difference in aortic size between the three normotensive WKY groups.\nHypertension increases the size of aortic aneurysms in this experimental model. Propranolol significantly reduces the size of experimental AAA in hypertensive animals independently of the dose and by a mechanism that may be unrelated to simple BP reduction.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine current practice in the treatment of all categories of popliteal aneurysms (PA) in light of the efficacy of intraarterial thrombolysis in PA presenting as acute ischemia.\nProspective data collected from 19 vascular surgeons from 200 PA in 137 patients during a 4-year period from 1989.\nThe most common presentation (125 PA) was leg ischemia, with the most severe symptom being claudication in 58, acute limb-threatening ischemia in 56, and digital atheroembolism in 11 limbs. The nonischemic group (75 PA) included 43 symptom-free cases and 32 cases with local symptoms arising from the popliteal fossa. Of 62 patients requiring emergency treatment, bypasses were done in 56, 10 of whom had early occlusion. Thrombolysis was used alone or in combination with bypass on 23 occasions, with 16 successful outcomes. Of 138 PA presenting electively, 80 underwent bypass, with one early occlusion, and 58 were observed. In the observed group, 18 later underwent bypass during a median follow-up of 22 months. The indications for late bypass were expansion of a small (< 2 cm) asymptomatic PA and the development of distal ischemia. There were 18 deaths in the observed group because of medical unfitness; limb ischemia did not develop during follow-up.\nIntraarterial thrombolysis is of value in restoring the distal run off before bypass in PA presenting as acute limb-threatening ischemia.

    "abstract": "Based on the prospective analysis of data on 680 patients undergoing surgery for nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and recorded in the Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery Aneurysm Registry, this study determines the late survival rate by comparison to an age- and sex-matched population, the causes of late death, the effect of heart-related death on late survival, and the prognostic variables that are associated with late survival.\nTo identify the variables that were associated with survival, statistical methods included Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis. The Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery Aneurysm Registry provided ongoing current follow-up of patients.\nThe survival rate was 94.6% at 1 month, 90.7% at 1 year, 87.1% at 2 years, 81.0% at 3 years, 74.0% at 4 years, 67.7% at 5 years, and 60.2% at 6 years. The late survival rate of patients with AAA is significantly less than the age- and sex-matched normal population (60.2% versus 79.2%). In the AAA group, heart-related causes of late death (44.4% versus 34.1%) and cerebrovascular causes (8.3% versus 5.8%) were more frequent. The calculated 5-year heart-related mortality rate is 14.3%. This is higher than the heart-related mortality rate for the age- and sex-matched population, which is 6.4%. Hence, the risk of heart-related death for patients who have undergone AAA repair is increased by 1.6% per year. Vascular complications from aortic aneurysm repair or recurrent aneurysmal disease were an uncommon cause of late death: ruptured thoracic aneurysm, 1.5%; ruptured aortic false aneurysm, 1.5%; and aortoenteric fistula, 0%. This incidence appears to be less than reported in earlier series. By Cox regression analysis, the variables that were significant predictors of a lower late survival rate were increased age, preoperative electrocardiogram indicating a previous myocardial infarction, and elevated serum creatinine levels.\nBecause cardiac complications accounted for 68.8% (22/32) of the 4.7% in-hospital mortality rate (i.e., a heart-related mortality rate of 3.2%), it seems reasonable to develop a strategy to reduce the cardiac operative risk by identifying and treating patients at high risk before operation. However, it is doubtful that a preoperative program that screens and treats all patients can be cost-effective in preventing late heart-related deaths.",

In this study, we have examined whether VSMC proliferation rates and responses to inhibition by heparin vary according to the individual or the anatomic site of origin.\nLong saphenous veins from seven patients were divided into proximal, middle, and distal portions, and VSMC were cultured separately from each. VSMC proliferation in response to 15% fetal calf serum +/- 100 micrograms/ml heparin was measured by counting triplicate samples at 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days. This experiment was repeated from the second to the sixth passage (n = 6) and for artery and vein pairs derived from four additional patients.\nDifferences between vein segment cultures of individual veins were found not to differ significantly from experimental error for either proliferation or heparin inhibition and were not altered by repeated passage (ANOVA). There were, however, significant differences in sensitivity to heparin inhibition between patients (p = 0.02) (ANOVA). There were no significant differences between paired samples of artery and vein for either proliferation or heparin inhibition (Mann-Whitney test).\nVSMC growth characteristics reflect the individual patient and are maintained in cell culture.",

    "abstract": "Although reperfusion of acutely ischemic extremities can cause cardiopulmonary collapse and death, the humoral agent(s) released from limbs promoting this distant organ injury are not well characterized. We hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine that causes cardiopulmonary dysfunction in septic shock, may be released from postischemic extremities.\nIsolated rat hindlimbs were perfused at constant pressure with a nonrecirculating crystalloid-based buffer. After 60 or 120 minutes of normothermic ischemia, TNF activity was measured in sequential samples of venous effluent by L929 bioassay. Associated limb injury was assessed by the extent of no-reflow after reperfusion, changes in endothelial permeability to iodine 125-labeled albumin and skeletal muscle injury by uptake of technetium 99 pyrophosphate.\nAfter 120 minutes of normothermic ischemia (n = 10), a 15-fold increase in TNF-alpha activity in venous effluent occurred, with peak activity at 1.5 minutes of reperfusion (30.6 +/- 8.7 U/ml) falling to near control levels by 5 minutes. This group had a 3.3-fold increase in vascular permeability, a 2.2-fold increase in the muscle injury index and a 71.2% decline in reperfusion flow (all p < 0.05 vs control). Pretreatment of extremities with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody in a second group of limbs undergoing 120 minutes of ischemia (n = 10) decreased TNF activity to levels not significantly different from the nonischemic control group (n = 12). The extent of no-reflow in limbs treated with antibodies was significantly attenuated (flow 44.9% of control vs 29.8% [untreated], p < 0.05). Antibody treatment affected neither muscle injury nor vascular permeability.\nPostischemic extremities exhibited a transient, early burst of TNF release on reperfusion, which likely represented washout of TNF produced during ischemia. Suppression of TNF activity with an antibody to TNF-alpha resulted in a salutary increase in postischemic flow rates, suggesting that TNF may play a role in the no-reflow phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Intravascular stents have become important tools for the management of vascular lesions; however, stents in combination with vascular grafts have only recently reached clinical application. This report describes an experience with stented grafts for the treatment of penetrating arterial trauma.\nSeven transluminally placed stented grafts were used to treat one arteriovenous fistula and six pseudoaneurysms. These grafts were successfully inserted percutaneously or through open arteriotomies that were remote from the site of vascular trauma. The devices were composed of balloon-expandable stainless steel stents covered with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts.\nPatency up to 14 months was achieved (mean follow-up 6.5 months) with these stented grafts. The use of stented grafts appears to be associated with decreased blood loss, a less invasive insertion procedure, reduced requirements for anesthesia, and a limited need for an extensive dissection in the traumatized field. These advantages are particularly important in patients with central arteriovenous fistulas or false aneurysms who are critically ill from other coexisting injuries or medical comorbidities.\nThe use of stented grafts already appears justified to treat traumatic arterial lesions in critically ill patients. Although the early results with the seven cases in this report are encouraging, documentation of long-term effectiveness must be obtained before these devices can be recommended for widespread or generalized use in the treatment of major arterial injuries.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate whether neurologic outcome after aortic cross-clamping in rabbits could be improved with perioperative infusion of the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea and, if so, to determine whether it is effective during the period of ischemia, reperfusion, or both.\nIn 41 New Zealand White rabbits, a snare occlusion device was placed at operation around the infrarenal aorta and tunneled into a subcutaneous position. Animals were then allowed to recover and, 48 hours later, randomized into four groups. In each group, the infrarenal aorta was occluded by tightening the snare in the awake animal. In groups 1, 2, and 3, cross-clamp time was 21 minutes. Group 1 (control) animals received saline solution, whereas group 2 (preclamp 21) received dimethylthiourea 750 mg/kg intravenously just before aortic clamping. In group 3 (prerep 21), dimethylthiourea was given just before reperfusion. Group 4 received dimethylthiourea before clamping, with cross-clamp time extended to 31 minutes. A second dose of saline solution or dimethylthiourea was given 12 hours after clamping in controls and the three treatment groups, respectively. Animals were observed for 5 days, and final neurologic recovery was graded by an independent observer. Animals were then killed, and their spinal cords were removed for histologic examination.\nComplete paraplegia and marked histologic spinal cord injury at 5 days were seen in 91% (10/11) of group 1 (control) animals, whereas all animals in group 2 (preclamp 21) showed neurologic recovery (p < 0.0001). In group 3 (prerep 21), the final paraplegia rate was 50% (5 of 10), in group 4 (preclamp 31), 100% (10 of 10).\nOur results suggest that hydroxyl radicals play an important role in ischemia-reperfusion injury of the spinal cord and that treatment with dimethylthiourea can prevent paraplegia after 21 minutes of aortic cross-clamping in rabbits.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study evaluated the possible prevention of postoperative neurologic deficit in patients at high risk with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), types I and II, by use of perioperative cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion.\nBetween September 18, 1992, and August 8, 1993, 45 consecutive patients underwent TAAA repair (14 type I, 31 type II). Thirty-six were men and nine were women. The median age was 63 years (range 28 to 88). Twenty-four of 45 patients (53%) had dissection and 17 of 45 (38%) had prior proximal aortic replacement. All patients underwent perioperative cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion. Median aortic clamping time was 42 minutes. Thirty-five of 45 patients (78%) underwent intercostal artery reattachment.\nThe 30-day survival rate was 96% (43 of 45 patients). Early neurologic deficit occurred in two of 45 patients (4%), and late neurologic deficit also occurred in two of 45 patients (4%). We compared the neurologic deficit of our current group of 45 patients with the data of a previously unpublished study of 112 patients also from this center. Total neurologic deficit for the current group was four of 45 (9%) versus the previous group of 35 of 112 (31%) with a p value of 0.0034 (Pearson chi-square test). Neurologic deficit for patients with type I TAAA was 0 of 14 (0%) versus 15 of 73 (21%) (p = 0.062); for patients with type II TAAA 4 of 31 (13%) versus 20 of 39 (51%) (p = 0.0008). In patients with aortic dissection, neurologic deficit was 3 of 24 (12%) versus 9 of 32 (28%) (p = 0.0304); no dissection was 1 of 21 (5%) versus 26 of 80 (32%) (p = 0.011). For aortic clamp times less than 45 minutes, neurologic deficit was 1 of 24 (4%) versus 14 of 68 (21%) (p = 0.061); for aortic clamp times equal to or greater than 45 minutes, neurologic deficit was 3 of 21 (14%) versus 21 of 44 (48%) (p = 0.0090).\nNeurologic deficit in patients treated for types I and II TAAA was reduced significantly by perioperative cerebral spinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Because unrecognized lesions can cause an arterial reconstruction to fail, duplex ultrasonography was evaluated as an intraoperative aid to assess technical adequacy and provide criteria for which lesions should be repaired immediately versus safely followed.\nSince 1990 intraoperative color duplex scanning(7 to 10 MHz linear array probe, pulsed-wave Doppler test spectrum analysis) was used to assess the frequency and severity of residual lesions in 368 patients after carotid endarterectomy (n = 210), infrainguinal vein bypass (n=135) or visceral/renal reconstruction (n = 23). Duplex scan results were categorized as normal or abnormal, with immediate repair of lesions demonstrating both lumen reduction and severe focal flow abnormalities (peak systolic velocity [Vp] > 150 to 180 cm/sec;velocity ratio [Vr] > 2.4). Arteriography was also performed in 81% of lower limb bypass procedures.\nDuplex scanning identified technical (residual plaque, stricture) or intrinsic defects (platelet thrombus, distal thrombosis) requiring revision in 37 (10%) of the reconstructions. Infrainguinal bypass had the highest incidence of corrected defects (14%) and adverse events (3%). No adverse events occurred in patients with normal duplex scan results or after carotid endarterectomy. Overall, 76% of identified defects were corrected (carotid, 17 of 24; infrainguinal bypass, 19 of 24; visceral bypass, 1 of 1). Unrepaired flow defects (Vp = 150 to 190 cm/sec; Vr = 1.8 to 2.5) led to one graft occlusion and three early revisions. Postoperative duplex scanning demonstrated residual stenosis in seven of 12 patients with unrepaired defects, two of 36 patients with repaired defects, and five of 312 patients with normal scan results (p < 0.001).\nBased on the types of lesions corrected and the low (< 0.5%) complication rate after a normal or modified arterial reconstruction, duplex scanning was found to be a valuable intraoperative aid. Unrepaired defects require close surveillance for progression.",

All eight were associated with a pulse deficit and were easily recognized. None of the eight had late sequelae after vascular repair. Thirty-three patients had vascular trauma as a result of motor vehicle crashes (n = 17), motor vehicle/pedestrian accidents (n = 12), or severe crush injuries (n = 4). Twenty-one (64%) were admitted in shock. Twenty-one major abdominal venous injuries were present in 17 patients and were lethal in 11 (65%). Abdominal venous injuries were not recognized before laparotomy. Nine of the 33 (27%) patients had extremity vascular injuries associated with orthopedic trauma, and three (9%) had major injuries of thoracic vessels. Only three patients had major abdominal arterial injuries in this series.\nVascular injuries resulting from blunt trauma are rare in the pediatric age group. Whereas blunt arterial injuries associated with long bone fractures are readily recognized, easily treated, and result in minimal late morbidity, blunt abdominal venous injuries are rarely recognized before exploration and are lethal in more than half.

One hundred twenty-nine patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were identified. Preoperative risk factors, intraoperative course, intensive case unit interventions including vasoactive agents, myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, bronchospasm, reintubation, neurologic events, and need for reoperation, were recorded. Timing of interventions, length of stay in intensive care unit, and postoperative course were all recorded. Financial impact was assessed.\nAmong 129 patients only 31 patients did not require intensive care unit interventions. A multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated a model in which a preoperative history of hypertension, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and chronic renal failure were 83% predictive of the need for an intensive care unit bed. Specifically, patients could be stratified into a low-risk group before the operation by less than four risk factors. Additionally, all patients requiring interventions or with adverse outcomes were identified by the eight postoperative hour.\nIn preoperative scheduling of intensive care unit beds, patients with less than four risk factors can be stratified to monitoring beds and those with greater than or equal to four can be stratified to intervention beds. After 8 hours, if no interventions are necessary or adverse outcomes occur, then floor recovery is safe. Patients who satisfy this algorithm would save 50% of current intensive care unit charges.",

To determine whether EISV bypass could reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) and perioperative morbidity without compromising patency, another 53 EISV bypasses for limb salvage were performed.\nTributary occlusion was accomplished with only fluoroscopic surveillance with a new, smaller, and more steerable silicone-tipped nitinol catheter.\nTwo (3.7%) wound complications occurred. The mean hospital LOS after operation was 4.2 days (range 2 to 29 days). All tributaries initially embolized remained occluded, and three \"missed\" arteriovenous fistulas were identified during follow-up extending to 15 month (mean 8.4 months). Eighty-eight percent (49 of 54) of phase II bypasses remained patent, whereas life-table analysis of all bypasses (phase I and II) was 77% (69/99) at 24 months follow-up (mean 13.6 months). By comparison, 41 infrainguinal saphenous vein in situ bypasses with \"classic\" open techniques were performed concurrently. The mean postoperative LOS was 11.6 days (range 4 to 42 days), wound complications occurred in 24% (10) of patients, and two \"missed\" arteriovenous fistulas were identified during follow-up. Eighty-three percent (34 of 41) of bypasses remain patent at 24 months follow-up (mean 16.2 months).\nIf EISV bypass long-term patency rates remain similar to classic in situ bypass patency results, the additional benefits of decreased hospital LOS, reduced wound-related complications, shortened recuperation, and therefore increased health care savings gives this endovascular technique strong consideration as the possible future operation for infrainguinal saphenous veins in situ bypass.",

All thirteen patients underwent operative removal of the tumor and tumor thrombus.\nThe patients with atrial extension who were treated with CPB and circulatory arrest had hospital and 1-year survival rates of 100% (three of three). The patients with retrohepatic extension treated without CPB and circulatory arrest had hospital and 1-year survival rates of 100% (three of three). The patients with infrahepatic extension treated without CPB and circulatory arrest had hospital and 1-year survival rates of 85% (six of seven) and 50% (three of six), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between groups. The hospital death occurred in a patient who had a massive pulmonary embolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation before operation. The deaths that occurred before 1 year were due to metastatic disease and unresectable disease at the time of operation.\nCPB with circulatory arrest is not required in patients with retrohepatic IVC extension of renal tumors, and aggressive resection can be performed in these patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of clinically silent venous thrombosis and the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in up to 35% of the general population suggests that paradoxical emboli may be the cause of an ischemic stroke or a peripheral thromboembolic occlusion more often than is presently considered. This study was undertaken to review our experience with presumed paradoxical embolism.\nHospital records were reviewed for all patients diagnosed with both a documented PFO and a thromboembolic event between January 1970 and June 1993. Patients with a ventricular or an atrial septal defect or a probable pulmonary arteriovenous fistula were excluded.\nThe presumptive diagnosis of paradoxical embolism was made in seven patients. There were five men and two women, with a median age of 43 years. Four patients were admitted with an acute cerebral ischemic event, and in three others hospitalization was prompted by the development of an acutely ischemic limb (two upper extremity; one lower extremity). In none was there evidence of angiographically significant peripheral or extracranial atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Symptoms suggestive of pulmonary emboli were noted in two patients, and in only one patient was there evidence on physical examination of a deep venous thrombosis. Before 1988 the diagnosis of paradoxical embolism had been made in only one patient after postmortem examination. All six patients who were discharged were available for follow-up (mean 20 months; range 6 to 60 months). There was one late death from lung cancer. Recurrent paradoxical emboli have not been documented during the follow-up period.\nThe incidence of presumed paradoxical embolism has increased dramatically in the recent past as a consequence of our improved ability to unequivocally detect PFO with associated physiologic shunting. The suspicion of this heretofore \"rare\" event should be raised, particularly in the young or middle-aged adult diagnosed with an acute thromboembolic event. Until the risk of recurrent ischemic events in the presence of a PFO is better defined, we currently recommend closure of the foramen ovale after a significant or recurrent paradoxical embolus. Otherwise, the selective use of intracaval filters, antiplatelet therapy, and oral anticoagulation remain undefined.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review the treatment of patients with failed or infected axillofemoral bypass grafts and to determine the efficacy of remedial procedures in maintaining graft patency and limb preservation.\nThirty-four patients with 37 failed or infected axillofemoral grafts were retrospectively reviewed. In nine cases there was no attempt at revascularization, and in the remaining 28 cases, a total of 52 remedial procedures was performed. Nine were performed in patients with graft infection and 43 in patients with graft thrombosis. In patients with axillofemoral graft failure, 21 thrombectomies, 13 graft revisions, and 9 secondary reconstructions were performed. Eighty-eight percent of patients were monitored at least 2 years or until graft failure.\nEight of nine patients receiving no remedial procedure required major amputation. The limb salvage rate was 64% +/- 11% at 30 months in the 25 patients undergoing remedial procedures. Twenty-eight percent of failed axillofemoral grafts remained patent at 2 years after initial failure with single or multiple thrombectomies or revisions. Life-table primary patency after secondary reconstructions (81% +/- 10.9% at 24 months) was significantly better than after thrombectomy alone (10% +/- 4.2% at 24 months) or graft revision (16% +/- 10.6% at 24 months) by log-rank test (p < 0.001 and p < 0.005, respectively). Patients undergoing reconstruction with descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass had an 89% +/- 11% patency rate at 24 months. Graft infection resulted in a perioperative mortality rate of 22% and amputation in 57% of survivors.\nAxillofemoral graft failure most often results in limb loss without remedial procedures. Thrombectomy and revision procedures had poor long-term patency rates and salvaged only a minority of grafts despite multiple procedures. Reconstruction by use of an alternate source of inflow such as the descending thoracic aorta resulted in better long-term patency rates in patients well enough to tolerate a major reoperative procedure.",

    "abstract": "We compared autogenous vein pedal and peroneal bypasses, focusing on extremities that could have a bypass to either artery.\nFrom 1985 to 1993 we performed a total of 175 pedal and 77 peroneal autogenous vein bypasses for rest pain (n = 75, 30%) and tissue loss (n = 177, 70%). One hundred ninety-six (78%) in situ saphenous vein and 56 (22%) reversed or composite vein bypasses were performed. One hundred fifty-two of these 252 bypasses were performed in extremities with both the pedal and peroneal arteries patent by arteriography. The vascular surgeon chose to perform 99 pedal and 53 peroneal vein bypasses in these 152 extremities.\nThe angiogram score of the outflow arteries were similar for pedal and peroneal bypasses with the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery and modified scoring systems. At 2 years the primary and secondary patency rates for pedal bypasses (70% and 77%) were not significantly different compared with those for peroneal bypasses (60% and 72%). Limb salvage rates at 2 years were similar for pedal and peroneal bypasses for all patients (74% and 73%), patients with both pedal and peroneal arteries patent (83% and 72%), diabetics (76% and 66%), and patients with tissue necrosis (77% and 71%).\nPedal and peroneal artery bypasses with equivalent angiogram scores have similar long-term graft patency and limb salvage. The choice between pedal or peroneal artery bypass should be based on the quality of vein and the surgeon's preference.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to review management options and late results of complex renovascular disease managed over the last 22 years.\nComplex branch renal artery disease in 84 kidneys was repaired during 75 operations performed in 68 consecutive patients. There were 61 females (90%) and 7 males (10%) whose predominant pathologic diagnosis was fibromuscular dysplasia manifesting as either renovascular hypertension or aneurysmal degeneration. These patients underwent 15 in situ, 52 ex vivo, and 8 combined reconstructions. In situ repair primarily with use of the bifurcated internal iliac artery autograft was used for primary lesions of the proximal renal artery bifurcation (two branches). Ex vivo repairs, primarily with use of the multibranch internal iliac autograft and hypothermic perfusion preservation, were used for all other patterns of distal renal artery branch disease and reoperative problems.\nRenovascular reconstruction was successful in salvaging 83 of 84 kidneys (98.8%) in 67 of 68 patients. There were no operative deaths. Two reconstructions thrombosed in the early postoperative period. One was due to severe aortic disease, the other to branch artery dissection after a failed balloon angioplasty. Both patients continued to have hypertension. Before hospital discharge 65 patients had 81 renal revascularizations proven patent by arteriography. Their renal function was assessed and blood pressure was determined in a follow-up extending to 20 years (mean 7.5 years, median 7.9 years). Late arteriograms were obtained in 30 patients (46%) an average of 52 months after operation (range 6 months to 18 years). They demonstrate stable renal artery repair with no evidence of late graft failure in each. Hypertension was cured or improved in 51 of 53 patients (96%) with a proven patent reconstruction. Aneurysms were successfully repaired in 11 patients. Renal function was improved in four patients with ex vivo repairs, unchanged in 59 patients (15 in situ, 44 ex vivo), and persistently worse in only three patients, all of whom had in situ repairs.\nThe branched arterial autograft allows the restoration of normal renal arterial anatomy and function when inserted to replace complex distal renovascular disease. This provides a durable repair, essential for younger patients affected by this pattern of disease who anticipate a normal life span after renovascular repair. Successful long-term correction of diastolic hypertension and aneurysmal disease was accomplished without significant morbidity.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study is to determine the efficacy and durability of renal endarterectomy in patients undergoing simultaneous aortic reconstruction. In addition, the operative risk to patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic renal artery stenosis is evaluated.\nThe results of a retrospective study of 101 patients who underwent combined procedures are presented. All patients demonstrated at least a 75% stenosis of the renal artery ostium by arteriography and underwent surgical repair of aneurysmal (n = 33) or aortic occlusive (n = 68) disease. The indications for renal revascularization were hypertension necessitating multiple medications (47%), hypertension combined with renal insufficiency (18%), renal insufficiency alone (5%), and asymptomatic stenosis (30%). Blood pressure and antihypertension medications were monitored during the follow-up period (mean 3.3 years).\nThe perioperative mortality rate was 1%, with a postoperative morbidity rate of 15%. The conditions of 74% of patients with hypertension were improved or cured, 23% were unchanged, and 3% were worse after surgery. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all patients remained significantly diminished during follow-up visits at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 6 years (p < 0.01). There was no significant improvement in serum creatinine levels in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. A small but statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and serum creatinine level was noted after operative intervention in the symptom-free patients (p < 0.005). There were no deaths in the asymptomatic subgroup, and significant azotemia did not develop in any of these patients after operation.\nRenal endarterectomy is an effective and durable method of renal revascularization. Furthermore, it is a technique that can be safely combined with aortic surgery and can be considered in the treatment of high-grade, asymptomatic lesions in patients undergoing aortic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Duplex examination is today the principal initial method of assessing extracranial carotid or vertebral artery disease. However, varying haemodynamic criteria have been described to categorize the degree of internal carotid artery stenosis, and similarly the degree of stenosis detected with angiography has been assessed with different methods as highlighted in studies performed by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial. This study looks at the correlation between two commonly used methods of assessing carotid artery stenosis with duplex criteria and the two methods of angiographic interpretation used in these trials. Duplex parameters are also identified to determine the greater than 70% stenosis group identified as at risk in these studies.\nA total of 120 carotid bifurcations were studied in patients who underwent both carotid duplex and angiography. Correlations of duplex with angiography were assessed with duplex criteria described by Zwiebel and by Strandness and the angiographic methods used in studies performed by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Receiver operator curves were constructed from the duplex data for the detection of stenosis greater than 70% based on the angiographic assessment used in the study performed by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial.\nThe duplex criteria described by Zwiebel and Strandness differed in their accuracy depending on which of the two methods was used to report the angiograms. Zwiebel's criteria agreed more with the angiographic method used in the study performed by the European Carotid Surgery Trial (sensitivity 98%, specificity 81%, accuracy 88%), whereas Strandness' criteria agreed more with the angiographic method used in the study performed by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (sensitivity 96%, specificity 85%, accuracy 89%). For the detection of a stenosis greater than 70%, a peak systolic velocity greater than 270 cm/sec and end diastolic velocity greater than 110 cm/sec provided a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 91%, and accuracy of 93%.\nThe accuracy of duplex studies compared with angiography in the assessment of extracranial vascular disease depends on the method of angiographic determination of carotid stenosis. Vascular laboratories should validate the duplex criteria they use against a standard method of angiographic assessment of carotid artery stenosis, with special reference to the recently reported studies noting the significance of a stenosis greater than 70% in patients with symptoms.",

We have performed a prospective 4-year duplex scan follow-up on polytetrafluoroethylene grafts to assess the usefulness of a surveillance program of prosthetic bypass grafts in preventing graft failure.\nOver 4 years 69 infrainguinal polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in 56 patients were studied at six monthly intervals by our vascular laboratory. Full duplex scan mapping of the grafts and inflow and outflow arteries and standard ankle pressure measurements were performed. A midgraft peak flow velocity was also measured.\nOver 4 years 27 (39.1%) grafts occluded without any predictive changes in the preceding duplex scan examination. Of the 42 (60.9%) grafts that remained patent, only four developed stenoses (three at the proximal anastomosis and one at the distal anastomosis) that were amenable to intervention. Changes in ankle pressures or midgraft flow velocity did not predict failure.\nThe low yield of remediable disease does not justify the cost of duplex scan surveillance of infrainguinal prosthetic bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "Since Blaisdell et al. first described axillobifemoral bypass and aortic exclusion to treat patients at high risk with abdominal aortic aneurysms in 1965, this approach has been controversial. To help define the appropriate application of this procedure, the recent experience of the authors was reviewed.\nTwenty-six patients underwent operation between March 1980 and August 1992. Mean age was 71 +/- 7 years. Average aneurysm diameter was 7.0 +/- 1.5 cm. Sixty-nine percent of the aneurysms were symptomatic; 21% were suprarenal. All patients had serious comorbid factors. All underwent axillobifemoral bypass with iliac artery ligation; the infrarenal aorta was also ligated in 62%.\nThere were two postoperative deaths (7.7%). One- and two-year survival rates were 59% and 38%, respectively. Three patients died of aneurysm rupture (11.5%); the aorta had not been ligated in two of these patients. The remaining late deaths were due to comorbid conditions. Extraanatomic bypass grafts thrombosed in five patients; no limbs were lost.\nAxillobifemoral bypass without aortic ligation does not effectively reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture. However, axillobifemoral bypass with aortic ligation is an acceptable treatment for patients with severe medical problems and symptomatic, anatomically complicated, or large abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because the risk of aneurysm rupture is not completely eliminated, this procedure should be reserved for patients with high-risk aneurysms who would not tolerate direct aortic replacement.",

Proliferation studies involved plating human iliac artery endothelial cells at one tenth confluence and counting the increase in cell number every 2 days for a 2-week period. Proliferation during monolayer repair was examined by determining bromodeoxyuridine uptake in cells located at the leading edge of a scrape-wounded monolayer.\nThrombin (1 to 8 U/ml) inhibited human iliac artery endothelial cell monolayer repair in a concentration-related, reversible manner. The effect was augmented by decreasing serum concentration and was independent of the presence of endothelial cell growth supplement. Inactivation of thrombin's proteolytic site with diisopropylfluorophosphate eliminated its effect on monolayer repair. Thrombin (0.5 to 8 U/ml) inhibited human iliac artery endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-related manner. This effect was augmented by decreasing serum concentration.

    "abstract": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) offers a rapid, minimally invasive method for diagnosing thoracic aortic disease. High-resolution images are possible because of the close proximity of the esophagus and vascular structures within the chest. Lung and chest wall components have little influence on the image quality and a virtually unobstructed view of the heart, thoracic aorta, and pulmonary vasculature is seen. The role of TEE in diagnosing diseases of the thoracic aorta is rapidly developing. The purpose of this study is to define the role of TEE in the diagnosis of thoracic aortic disease.\nBetween July 1, 1989 and December 31, 1992, 1005 TEEs were performed at our center. Of these, 199 (125 men, 74 women) were entered into our aortic disease registry. Indications for the studies included 37 referrals to rule out aortic dissection, 18 to assess aortic aneurysm, 55 to assess for an intraaortic source of embolus, 9 to rule out intraaortic thrombus, and 13 with familial hyperlipidemia being followed to mark response to low-density lipoprotein apheresis. In 67 cases, subclinical aortic plaquing was found incidentally. No complications from the TEE procedure were encountered.\nIn cases of suspected aortic dissection, TEE was equal to computed tomography (CT) scanning in identifying the type (DeBakey) and extent of thoracic aortic dissection. In addition, TEE provided information regarding functional status of the aortic valve, identified interluminal communications, and assessed blood flow and thrombus burden in the false lumen. TEE correctly identified true aneurysms, intraluminal thrombus, and plaques as possible sources of emboli. One false-positive CT scan result for aortic dissection was seen and was ruled out both by TEE and angiography.\nBiplane TEE can be considered the method of choice in diagnosing disease of the thoracic aorta. Information from TEE can be obtained at the patient's bedside or in the operating suite, to assess surgical results before procedure termination and afterward for follow-up. Adjunctive magnetic resonance imaging, CT scanning, or aortography may be needed to assess extension of the disease process into the abdomen or pelvis or to plan surgical intervention.",

Intima, internal elastic membrane, media, external elastic membrane, and adventitia were identified, if present.\nWhen the procedure of separating the diseased intima from the remainder of the arterial wall was commenced, the cleavage plane was located between the internal elastic membrane and the media in most cases. In two cases the cleavage plane was located inside the intima, and in one case parts of the media were removed as well. During passage of the ring stripper through the artery, the location of the cleavage plane changes and extends into the media.

    "abstract": "Although early death from perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) after vascular surgery is well established, long-term outcome in patients surviving PMI is unknown. This prospective study was designed to determine cardiac outcome and survival rates in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic nonfatal PMI associated with peripheral vascular surgery.\nDuring a 36-month period for 1989 to 1992, all patients undergoing vascular surgery at our institution were monitored for PMI with serial creatine kinase and myocardial band isoenzymes and electrocardiography. PMIs were classified as symptomatic (associated with chest pain, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or hypotension) or asymptomatic (electrocardiographic changes and/or elevated creatine kinase and myocardial band isoenzymes). Patients with PMI were then prospectively monitored and compared for late survival, with control patients undergoing vascular surgery without PMI during the same interval.\nDuring the study period 1561 major peripheral vascular procedures were performed. There were 47 PMIs (3.0%). Eleven (0.7%) PMIs were fatal, 31 were nonfatal, and five other patients with PMI died during operation of non-heart-related causes. Eight of 31 patients with nonfatal PMI had a \"chemical PMI\" with creatine kinase and myocardial band isoenzyme elevation as the sole indicator of PMI. During follow-up (mean 27.7 months), there was a higher incidence of both subsequent myocardial infarction and coronary artery revascularization among the patients with nonfatal PMI compared with control subjects (p < 0.05); however, survival for patients with nonfatal PMI at 1 and 4 years (80% and 51%) did not differ from that of control patients (90% and 60%) (p > 0.05). Patients with \"chemical PMI\" had similar patterns of subsequent myocardial infarction and coronary intervention as control patients.\nPatients surviving nonfatal PMI after peripheral vascular surgery have a higher incidence of subsequent adverse cardiac events and coronary artery revascularization than patients undergoing vascular surgery without PMI, but they have similar survival rates at 1 and 4 years. Patients in the enzyme-only PMI group have a similar outcome compared with control subjects suggesting that a perioperative \"chemical MI\" may not be a significant clinical event.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the short- and long-term results for patients undergoing thrombolysis of occluded infrainguinal bypass grafts at our institution over a 62-month period.\nThirty-one patients with 40 episodes of graft thrombosis in 33 grafts managed by thrombolysis were retrospectively reviewed. The effects of graft age, material, and anatomy, symptoms, treatment, anticoagulation, and occlusion duration were evaluated for impact on patency after thrombolysis. Dose and duration of therapy with use of the technique of pulse-spray thrombolysis was assessed.\nThrombolysis successfully reestablished patency in 92% of grafts treated. Mean lysis time and urokinase dose were 118 minutes and 607,000 units, respectively. Responsible lesions were identified and treated by angioplasty or surgery in 35 of 37 cases. The patency rate after thrombolysis was 28% at 30 months, and the secondary patency rate was 46% at 18 months. Duration of occlusion, symptoms, treatment, graft anatomy, and prior graft revision did not impact on patency. Mean secondary patency was 21.5 months in grafts in place over 1 year and 7.0 months in grafts in place for less than 1 year. Mean secondary patency was 23.8 months in polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and 8.4 months in vein grafts. The limb salvage rate was 84% at 30 months, and the patient survival rate was 84% at 42 months.\nPulse-spray thrombolysis is effective in rapidly recanalizing thrombosed infrainguinal grafts. Grafts failing in the first year after placement should generally be replaced, reserving thrombolysis and revision for grafts greater than 1 year old. Vein grafts tolerate thrombosis less well than synthetic conduits and have decreased long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to compare repeat percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (rPTA), arterial reconstruction, and noninvasive therapy for treatment of patients with recurrent stenosis after PTA of the superficial femoral or popliteal artery.\nFrom 1983 to 1993, 93 patients were treated for recurrent femoropopliteal stenosis. Indication for treatment was claudication in 72 patients, rest pain in 9, and ischemic ulcer in 12. Thirty-six patients (38%) were treated with arterial bypass, 35 (38%) with rPTA, and 22 (24%) with exercise and medication. Patients were monitored with clinical examination, ankle-brachial indexes, and duplex scanning. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 110 months (mean 42 months).\nWith life-table analysis, the clinical and hemodynamic success of patients treated with rPTA was 41% at 1 year, 20% at 2 years, and 11% at 3 years. For patients treated with arterial bypass, the primary graft patency rate was 84%, 72%, and 72% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The secondary graft patency rate was 94%, 88%, and 88% at the same intervals. All patients with patent grafts were symptom free. All 22 patients treated with noninvasive therapy continued to have symptoms, but none required amputation during follow-up (range 6 to 108 months). Overall, patients with claudication did better than those treated for rest pain or an ischemic lesion after either rPTA or arterial bypass, but no other variable was statistically significant in predicting outcome.\nThis study finds that arterial bypass is safe and more effective than rPTA in treating patients with recurrent stenosis. Preoperative evaluation is unable to select patients likely to benefit from rPTA. Repeat PTA should be reserved for patients with limited life expectancy or contraindications to operation.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous access to the arterial system for endovascular procedures is usually achieved through the femoral arteries. When femoral access is precluded, the axillary or brachial arteries serve as alternatives. Complications associated with the use of the latter arteries have led us to develop subclavian arterial catheterization.\nFrom 1978 to 1993, 569 patients underwent angiography via the subclavian artery (> 99% left subclavian artery); 134 were studies of the aortic arch and brachiocephalic vessels; 435 studies involved the descending and abdominal aorta and its branches and runoff. Coronary arteriography was also feasible. Since 1986, 44 patients have undergone endovascular procedures: 33 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties of the visceral, iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries and 11 thrombolytic procedures of aortofemoral graft limbs (n = 3) and femoral distal bypasses (n = 8) were performed. Complications (1.2%) included partial pneumothorax (n = 2), hemorrhage requiring operative control (n = 2), causalgia (n = 1) and embolization (n = 2).\nWhenever percutaneous femoral catheterization cannot be achieved or an alternate access point is indicated, we select the subclavian approach as an alternative to axillary, brachial or translumbar access. It is safe, expeditious, and versatile for virtually all types of systemic and cardiac catheterization; it is also applicable to thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Current information concerning the results of surgical revision of threatened infrainguinal vein grafts is largely limited to in situ conduits. Infrainguinal grafts may be threatened by intrinsic graft lesions or significant stenosis in the adjacent inflow or outflow arteries. To assess the results of operative revision of infrainguinal reversed vein grafts, we reviewed our experience with surgical revision of threatened infrainguinal reversed vein grafts identified through a program of postoperative clinical and vascular laboratory graft surveillance.\nAll patients who underwent surgical revision of a threatened but patent infrainguinal reversed vein graft from January 1987 through April 1993 were identified through review of our vascular registry. Data were analyzed for type of vein used, date of original reversed vein graft, clinical and vascular laboratory findings leading to reversed vein graft revision, results of preoperative angiography, patient risk factors, operative techniques and complications, and long-term assisted primary graft patency and limb salvage.\nNinety-six patients with 100 infrainguinal reversed vein grafts (69) femoral-popliteal, 31 femoral-tibial) underwent 117 surgical vein graft revisions or inflow procedures during the study period. Eighty-one percent of the original reversed vein grafts consisted of a single segment of greater saphenous vein. All revised grafts had at least a 50% stenosis in the graft itself or the proximal or distal artery. A single revision was performed in 85 grafts, two revisions in 13 grafts, and three revisions in two grafts. There were nine (8%) isolated inflow procedures, eight (7%) vein patch angioplasties, 62 (53%) interposition vein grafts, and 29 (25%) vein graft extensions to a new distal anastomotic site. The remaining nine (8%) procedures consisted of combinations of the above. Median time to primary graft revision after initial graft implantation was 15 months (range 2 days to 316 months). Mean time to secondary revision after primary revision was 21 months. Operative mortality was 0.9%. Cumulative assisted primary patency of the original grafts revised for stenotic lesions was 99%, 96%, and 92% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Limb salvage was 99%, 97%, and 97% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.\nAlthough surgical revision of reversed vein graft requires much use of alternative vein sources, these procedures can be performed with minimum mortality and provide excellent assisted primary graft patency and limb salvage.",

This model was implanted in the canine descending thoracic aorta with 30 microns polytetrafluoroethylene grafts anastomosed at each end. An 8 cm, three-component graft completely coated with silicone rubber was implanted in the canine abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. Implant periods ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. Flow surfaces were studied by use of stereomicroscopy after being stained with silver nitrate, and by use of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, the inner wall and flow surface were studied by light microscopy after hematoxylin-eosin and immunocytochemical staining (the latter for endothelial and smooth muscle cells), and the full wall was studied by light microscopy after hematoxylin-eosin staining.\nEffective prevention of pannus and transmural ingrowth into the impervious central test grafts was achieved, and scattered islands of endothelial cells were conclusively demonstrated on flow surfaces in each of the three implant sites 4 weeks after implantation. In the descending thoracic aorta, where these grafts were also implanted for 8 and 12 weeks, alpha-actin-positive cells and microvessels were found beneath some of the endothelial islands.\nFallout endothelialization of Dacron vascular grafts occurs in both the arterial and venous systems of the dog.",

    "abstract": "Retrospective studies have demonstrated an accelerated growth rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms in heart transplant patients. This prospective study was undertaken to define the relationship between cardiac hemodynamics and posttransplant aortic dilation.\nSixty-eight patients undergoing heart (n = 60) or heart-lung (n = 8) transplantation were prospectively evaluated with abdominal ultrasonography before transplantation and annually after transplantation. Risk factors implicated in aneurysm growth, including age, indication for transplantation, immunosuppression, posttransplantation hypertension, and abdominal aortic dimension before transplantation were recorded. All patients underwent annual coronary artery catheterization and multiple gated acquisition scanning.\nThirty-seven patients (54%) had no change in aortic diameter after transplantation (pretransplantation and posttransplantation diameter = 1.8 +/- 0.3 cm), over a mean follow-up period of 28 +/- 14 months. In the remaining 31 (46%) patients, aortic diameter increased by 0.5 +/- 0.6 cm over 31 +/- 15 months (p < 0.05). Four (6%) of these 31 patients had abdominal aortic aneurysms (mean aortic diameter = 5.0 +/- 0.8 cm). The mean increase in aortic diameter among these 4 patients was 1.8 +/- 0.2 cm (annual rate of growth = 0.96 +/- 0.3 cm/year). Patients experiencing an increase in aortic dimension after transplantation had significantly lower (p < 0.005) pretransplantation ejection fractions (17.1% +/- 10.5% vs 28.6% +/- 18.1%) and, as a consequence, significantly greater (p < 0.05) increases in their ejection fractions after transplantation compared with patients with stable aortic dimensions (42.7% +/- 12.6% vs 31.8% +/- 18.0%).\nOf 68 heart transplant patients prospectively evaluated, aortic diameter increased in 31 (46%); new aneurysms developed in four of these patients. Greater incremental increases in cardiac ejection fraction were significant correlates with aortic enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Early repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is particularly appropriate for those that are most likely to expand. Our aim was to define features on computed tomography (CT) scanning associated with subsequent rapid aneurysm expansion.\nWe reviewed CT scans of 80 patients with AAA (> 3.0 cm) who underwent CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis two times, at least 6 months apart, between 1986 and 1992. The aneurysms initially measured 4.4 +/- 0.6 cm, and the mean interval between obtaining scans was 22 +/- 12 months. Clinical variables assessed included age, sex, medical risk factors, underlying cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and administration of beta blockers and lipid-lowering agents. Computer-aided measurements on each CT scan section included the maximal and minimal diameters and area of the aneurysm. Dimensions of the luminal thrombus and the arc of aneurysm wall covered by thrombus (TARC). Maximal aneurysm dimensions were related to juxtarenal aortic and second lumbar vertebral body dimensions.\nMean aneurysm expansion was 0.26 +/- 0.25 cm/yr. CT scanning variables that correlated significantly with rate of expansion included the mean TARC (r = 0.43, p < 0.001), thrombus volume fraction (r = 0.37, p < 0.001), TARC on the largest aneurysm cross section (r = 0.34, p < 0.01), and thrombus area fraction (r = 0.30, p < 0.01). Rapid expansion (> 0.5 cm/yr) occurred in 15 (19%) aneurysms. The two predictors for rapid expansion on logistic regression analysis were mean TARC (p < 0.005) and the presence of carotid artery disease (p < 0.05).\nAn increased AAA thrombus load is associated with a higher likelihood of rapid expansion and should weigh in favor of early surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "Acute disruption at or adjacent to axillary anastomoses of axillofemoral grafts has been sporadically reported. We have recently reported the patency and limb salvage results of a large number of axillofemoral grafts. In this report we describe a series of axillary artery-graft disruptions that occurred in these patients.\nBeginning in 1983, axillofemoral bypass was performed by the authors using standardized operative technique and a single prosthetic graft material (8 mm externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene). Axillary anastomoses were placed on the first portion of the artery and were performed with the arm abducted and with the graft redundant. The records and operative reports of all patients with disruption were reviewed for findings and subsequent hospital course.\nTwo hundred two axillofemoral grafts were performed from 1983 to 1993. Ten patients (5%) had axillary disruption at intervals ranging from 1 to 46 days (mean 21 days) after operation. Ischemia was the indication for operation for seven of the patients and infected aortic prostheses for three. Infection did not occur in any of the axillary wounds and was not the cause of any of the disruptions. Four disruptions occurred with arm abduction/shoulder elevation movements; three awakened patients from sleep, and one occurred while the patient was sitting quietly. For the other two patients, preceding activity was unknown. Brachial plexus deficit was present in one patient. Four of the 10 disrupted grafts were also acutely occluded. Operative findings included sutures pulling out of the artery in four cases, tearing or sutures pulling out of the graft in four cases, and cause unknown in two cases. Treatment included arterial ligation in one patient, and restoration of circulation through revision of the axillofemoral grafts in the other nine patients. There were no operative deaths. One patient had a prolonged hospital course followed by nursing home placement and died 9 months later. The brachial plexus deficit did not resolve. There have been no repeat disruptions.\nWe conclude that axillofemoral grafting includes the potential for disruption of the proximal anastomosis, which has occurred in 5% of our patients. Although multiple steps have been recommended to avoid this complication, occasional cases continue to occur despite observing all precautions.",

There were 13 women and six men; age 17 to 64 years, mean 37 years. Thirteen procedures were performed on the left side and eight on the right. Indications for surgery were causalgia/reflex sympathetic dystrophy in nine patients, Raynaud's/vasculitis in six, hyperhidrosis in five, and medically refractory cardiac arrhythmia in one.\nThe T1-4 sympathetic ganglia were readily identified, dissected free, and resected thoracoscopically in 19 cases, and the T3-7 ganglia were resected with thoracoscopy in one case. One case required conversion to an open thoracotomy because of dense scar from a previous first rib resection, which obscured the anatomy. Histologic confirmation of ganglia were obtained in all 21 cases. Operative duration ranged from 1.0 to 3.5 hours. Estimated blood loss was 5 to 300 cc, mean 42 cc, median 10 cc. No patient required transfusion. All 21 patients had an excellent immediate sympathectomy response. Transient Horner's syndrome developed in two patients. Postoperative residual pneumothorax (< 10%) occurred in three cases and resolved spontaneously without further treatment. In one patient pleural effusion and pneumothorax developed, which were treated with the reinsertion of the chest tube. Postoperative pain was well controlled with oral analgesics. Hospital stay was 1 to 4 days, mean 2 days, median 1 day. Follow-up at 1 to 42 months, mean 11 months, median 6 months, showed continued evidence of sympathectomy effect in all patients, except one who died of her underlying disease 1 month after operation.\nWe conclude that thoracoscopic sympathectomy is feasible, safe, and effective. Further studies are indicated to confirm its long-term benefits and to determine optimal thoracoscopic techniques.",

    "abstract": "Patients with critical carotid artery stenoses have been considered to be at high risk for carotid artery occlusion necessitating urgent or emergency endarterectomy once the stenosis is identified. Included in this group of patients are those with carotid string sign or atheromatous pseudoocclusion (APO). This review was conducted to determine the impact of the severity of stenosis including APO on the treatment and outcome of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.\nThe records of 203 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed in 197 patients were reviewed in detail. Patients were stratified into a critical stenosis group (80% to 99% diameter) and noncritical stenosis group based on noninvasive vascular laboratory and carotid arteriography results. Comparisons were performed of demographic data, atherosclerotic risk factors, carotid artery disease presentation, interval between arteriography and endarterectomy, operative details, and surgical results between the critical and noncritical groups and between patients in the critical group with and without APO.\nCarotid endarterectomies were performed on 91 critical carotid artery stenoses and 112 noncritical stenoses. The groups did not differ significantly with regards to demographics, risk factors, carotid artery disease presentation, mean back pressure, and operative use of shunt or patch closure. For the critical group the interval between arteriography and endarterectomy was 8.63 +/- 2.38 days compared with 9.64 +/- 2.14 days for the noncritical group (mean +/- SEM, p = 0.75). No patient in either group progressed to occlusion in the interval between arteriography and endarterectomy. Perioperative strokes occurred in two patients (2%) in the critical group and four patients (3.6%) in the noncritical group (p = 0.09). Likewise, no significant difference was demonstrated in these variables when comparing patients with critical carotid artery stenosis and APO with those without APO.\nThe presence of a critical carotid artery stenosis including APO did not impact on the treatment or outcome of patients requiring endarterectomy nor did it imply the need for emergency intervention to prevent thrombosis. Surgical intervention can proceed after evaluation and optimization of comorbid conditions without undue concern for interval thrombosis.",

The groups did not differ significantly with regards to demographics, risk factors, carotid artery disease presentation, mean back pressure, and operative use of shunt or patch closure. For the critical group the interval between arteriography and endarterectomy was 8.63 +/- 2.38 days compared with 9.64 +/- 2.14 days for the noncritical group (mean +/- SEM, p = 0.75). No patient in either group progressed to occlusion in the interval between arteriography and endarterectomy. Perioperative strokes occurred in two patients (2%) in the critical group and four patients (3.6%) in the noncritical group (p = 0.09). Likewise, no significant difference was demonstrated in these variables when comparing patients with critical carotid artery stenosis and APO with those without APO.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine adverse outcomes associated with the nonoperative management of intimal injuries.\nA five-year retrospective review of 118 patients admitted with soft signs of vascular injury to two level I trauma centers was conducted. All injuries evaluated were isolated penetrating injuries. The number of major arteries at risk were 16 axillary, 31 brachial, 36 common femoral, 22 superficial femoral, and 13 deep femoral. Twenty-three angiographic abnormalities were identified in 23 limbs. Seven injuries were categorized as \"minor\" intimal flaps and treated with observation alone. The remainder were explored during operation.\nDuring the follow-up period, six of the seven patients treated without operation returned to either the outpatient clinic or emergency department with acute onset of pain or paresthesia in the previously injured limb. The following abnormalities were identified with angiography: one axillary artery thrombosis, one brachial artery pseudoaneurysm, two common femoral thromboses, two superficial femoral artery/superficial femoral vein fistulas, and one deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. All the abnormalities were repaired with operation.\nThe benign nature of intimal injury identified with angiography may be overemphasized. The results of long-term follow-up in patients with this type of injury must be reviewed before \"observation alone\" can be recommended as standard treatment.",

Three patients, a 23-year-old man, a 31-year-old woman, and a 39-year-old man, were referred with symptomatic varicose veins of the arm. None of the patients had lower extremity varicosities. Diagnosis was made by physical examination, noninvasive and invasive procedures, and excluded vascular malformations. Surgical treatment, similar to that for lower extremity varicose veins, entailed ligation and stripping of the varicose veins. Ligation and stripping were performed and successfully eliminated the varicosities with prevention of recurrence with a mean follow-up of 17 months. Although primary varicose veins of the upper extremity are extremely rare, they can be readily diagnosed and successfully treated, similar to lower extremity varicose veins. Although not proven, the cause is likely identical to lower extremity varicose veins. Excellent functional and cosmetic results can be obtained with surgical treatment.",

Degenerative diseases of aberrant subclavian arteries including aneurysms and occlusive disease have been reported previously. We believe that this case is the first reported case of fibromuscular hyperplasia affecting an aberrant subclavian artery. A 25-year-old woman admitted with a history consistent with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome was found to have a reduced pulse and blood pressure on the ipsilateral side caused by fibromuscular hyperplasia of an aberrant subclavian artery. A carotid-subclavian bypass via a supraclavicular incision was performed at the same time as thoracic outlet decompression. Histologic examination confirmed the presence of fibromuscular hyperplasia in the aberrant subclavian artery. This case is discussed with reference to the available literature.",

The late negative waves of both lumbar descending ESCP and segmental ESCP were more sensitive than other components of ESCPs. Postoperative paraplegia occurred in the two cases that showed persistent diminution of amplitude in the late negative waves. Segmental ESCP was less reliable than lumbar descending ESCP, because it depended entirely on the adequate perfusion of the lower extremities.\nLumbar descending ESCP was the best method for the spinal cord ischemia during aortic aneurysm surgery. Spinal cord ischemia could be detected by diminution in the amplitude of the late negative wave of lumbar descending ESCP.

Fifty-one patients were diagnosed with bilateral carotid artery stenosis and were included in a prospective study that consisted of performance of CEA on one side and SVG on the other. The patients consisted of 34 men and 17 women. Forty patients had symptoms, and 11 were symptom free with severe (> or = 90%) bilateral carotid artery stenosis. All patients underwent a two-stage procedure with an operative interval that ranged from 5 days to 6 months.\nAll patients survived, and no permanent postoperative neurologic deficit was observed. Follow-up was available for all patients and ranged from 6 to 150 months (mean 52 months). Serial Doppler studies were performed in all patients at 6- to 9-month intervals. Unilateral RCS (> or = 80%) occurred in two cases (two of 102); one in a CEA (one of 51) and one in the distal anastomosis of a SVG (one of 51) at 6 and 8 months, respectively, after operation. The reoperative surgical technique performed in both cases was a SVG.\nThe incidence of RCS requiring repeat operation after carotid artery surgery is not influenced by the choice of the surgical technique, namely CEA or saphenous vein bypass.",

We assessed fistula patency and occlusion rate in elbow fistulas compared with wrist and graft fistulas.\nWe analyzed all 104 fistulas created in all 68 patients who underwent hemodialysis during October 1993 at the St. Joseph General Teaching Hospital, Veldhoven, The Netherlands. Life-table patency and complications were analyzed for 31 elbow fistulas, 56 wrist fistulas, and 17 polytetrafluoroethylene or saphenous vein graft fistulas.\nThe patency rate for elbow fistulas was 93% at 1 year and 80% at 3 years. Wrist fistulas had a patency rate of 76% at 1 year and 65% at 3 years. Graft fistulas had a poorer patency rate: 69% at 1 year and 62% at 3 years. There were significantly more failures in the wrist fistulas (p < 0.02). Thrombosis accounted for most fistula failures. Venous stenosis was the most frequent indication for revision. The high incidence of concomitant diseases was not related to fistula outcome.\nThe elbow fistula performed better than the wrist fistula. Liberal use of the elbow fistula is justified, especially when the epifascial veins or the radial artery at the wrist is in poor condition. Graft fistulas should be reserved for tertiary procedures.",

    "abstract": "Most aneurysms are generally presumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. Endothelium-dependent dilations were impaired in the cases of atherosclerosis. It is not clear whether the endothelial function of the peripheral arteries in humans with abdominal aortic aneurysm is impaired. The purpose of this study is to characterize endothelium-dependent relaxations in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nResponses of external iliac artery blood flow to acetylcholine (30 micrograms/min: an endothelium-dependent vasodilator) and sodium nitroprusside (10 micrograms/min: a direct dilator of smooth muscle) were examined by electromagnetic blood flow meter in a group of 13 patients consisting of six patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, six patients with colorectal cancer, and one patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm and rectal cancer.\nThe mean blood flow before administration of drugs was comparable between the two groups. In the patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, infusion of acetylcholine did not significantly increase the mean blood flow, whereas in the patients with colorectal cancer, acetylcholine increased the blood flow significantly. The increases of blood flow by an infusion of sodium nitroprusside were comparable between the two groups. In one patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm and rectal cancer, acetylcholine did not alter the blood flow, and sodium nitroprusside increased the blood flow, which was similar to what the patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm experienced.\nThese results suggest that in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, the endothelium-dependent vasodilations of the peripheral artery were impaired without changing the smooth muscle property.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the two-dimensional compliance changes that develop in low-grade hemodynamically insignificant stenoses.\nTwenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. In 14 rats, balloon injury and endothelial denudation of the common carotid artery was followed by the application of a ligature, which produced a 20% narrowing of the outer diameter; five other rats were similarly injured without creating a stenosis, and five were stenosed without injury. The latter two groups served as control. Two-dimensional measures of arterial wall motions were obtained 30 minutes and 3 days after surgery by use of a video motion analyzer. Subsequently, circumferential (Cc) and longitudinal (Cl) compliance values were calculated and analyzed.\nAt 30 minutes, in the injured stenosed arteries, overall Cc was significantly greater than in the nonstenosed injured arteries at all measured points along the artery. Both stenosed injured and stenosed noninjured arteries also displayed increased Cc both proximal and distal to the stenoses compared with Cc values furthest from the stenosis. Cl values in the stenosed arteries, both injured and noninjured, became negative across the stenosis. All two-dimensional compliance changes occurred within the area of arterial narrowing and gradually resolved approaching the nonstenotic region of the artery. At systole, in the adjacent to the stenosis arterial segments, circumferential distension was accompanied by simultaneous longitudinal compression. Three days after surgery, although Cc increased proximal and distal to the stenosis and Cl decreased in the areas adjacent to the stenoses, no statistically significant difference was found.\nLow-grade stenosis results in a longitudinal compression accompanied by a relatively increased circumferential distension of arterial segments adjacent to the stenotic region. This pattern is not initiated or influenced by the presence or absence of endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cultured alone exhibit characteristic \"hill and valley\" macroscopic growth features. We studied smooth muscle cells cocultured with endothelial cells and the effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 on smooth muscle cells: Bovine smooth muscle cells were plated on 13 microns-thick semipermeable membranes. Smooth muscle cells were cultured either alone (in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Media/2.5% calf serum, four wells/group); with neutralizing anti-transforming growth factor-beta 1 antibody (10 micrograms/ml); with the protease inhibitor aprotinin (prevents plasmin-mediated activation of transforming growth factor-beta 1, 200 mg/ml); or in the presence of confluent bovine endothelial cells cocultured on the opposite side of the membrane before plating smooth muscle cells. After 72 hours in culture smooth muscle cell organizational growth characteristics were examined by light microscopy. Hill and valley formation by smooth muscle cells resulted in areas of the membrane becoming devoid of smooth muscle cells, whereas other areas developed multilayered densely populated smooth muscle cells. Computed planimetry was used to measure this bare surface area to quantitate the extent of hill and valley growth, which was compared between groups by analysis of variance. Smooth muscle cells cultured alone demonstrated prominent hill and valley formation with a bare surface area of 2.64 +/- 0.51 mm2. Smooth muscle cells exposed to transforming growth factor-beta 1 antibody had much less hill and valley formation (bare surface area 0.92 +/- 0.29, p < 0.01), whereas aprotinin virtually prevented hill and valley formation (bare surface area 0.0, p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by an accelerated turnover of extracellular matrix proteins and by an inflammatory infiltrate that releases the cytokines interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We examined the gene expression of human aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells and normal aortic smooth muscle cells after treatment with interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by measuring the changes in smooth muscle cell collagen, elastin, collagenase, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase messenger ribonucleic acid levels in response to these cytokines.\nBiopsy of aneurysmal aorta (n = 6) and donor normal aorta (n = 3) was obtained at operation. Medial smooth muscle cells were cultured, passaged (P2 to P4), and incubated with 0, 10, 100, or 1000 pg/ml interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or platelet-derived growth factor for 24 hours. Total ribonucleic acid was harvested. Percentage changes in messenger ribonucleic acid from control levels for type I and type III procollagen, elastin, collagenase, 72 kDa type IV collagenase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 were measured by Northern hybridization. Analyses were performed with analysis of variance (p < 0.05). All comparisons between aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells and normal aortic smooth muscle cells represent comparisons between one aneurysmal aorta and one normal aorta.\nAdded interleukin-1 beta resulted in significant, dose-dependent increases in the collagenase messenger ribonucleic acid level at all concentrations tested in both aneurysmal aorta and normal aorta. The increase in the collagenase messenger ribonucleic acid level ranged from a minimum increase of 123% for 10 pg/ml interleukin-1 beta in aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells to a maximum of 450% for 1000 pg/ml interleukin-1 beta in normal aortic smooth muscle cells. Interleukin-1 beta caused a significant decrease in the steady-state messenger ribonucleic acid levels for type 1 procollagen in both aneurysmal and normal aorta. The greatest reduction in type 1 procollagen messenger ribonucleic acid levels occurred at 100 pg/ml interleukin-1 beta in both aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells (-39%) and normal aortic smooth muscle cells (-48%). The only observed qualitative difference between aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells and normal aortic smooth muscle cells was the change in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 messenger ribonucleic acid levels in response to added interleukin-1 beta. In aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells interleukin-1 beta at 1000 pg/ml significantly increased messenger ribonucleic acid levels by 82%, whereas levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 messenger ribonucleic acid in normal aortic smooth muscle cells did not change in response to added interleukin-1 beta. Interleukin-1 beta did not alter messenger ribonucleic acid levels for type III procollagen, elastin, type IV collagenase, or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 in aneurysmal aorta or normal aorta. When tumor necrosis factor-alpha or platelet-derived growth factor were added, this did not significantly change aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells messenger ribonucleic acid levels for collagenase, type IV collagenase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, and type I and type III procollagen.\nThese findings suggest that interleukin-1 beta, through its effect on smooth muscle cell collagenase and collagen gene expression, mediates the increased matrix turnover observed in aneurysms. Macrophages may induce changes in aortic smooth muscle cell gene expression in a paracrine manner that could lead to aneurysm formation.",

Most of the responding surgeons consider venous thromboembolism a serious health problem. Ninety percent of the surgeons use prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism routinely. The most frequently used modalities are intermittent pneumatic compression, low-dose heparin, and elastic stocking. A combination of physical and pharmacologic methods is used by one fourth of respondents, and only 50% start pharmacologic prophylaxis before the surgical procedure. The thrombosis risk factors that are most frequently considered by surgeons when deciding about using prophylaxis are history of venous thromboembolism, immobility, and length of operation.\nNorth American surgeons who responded to this survey are well aware of the problem of venous thromboembolism and their approach to prevention has been significantly modified in the last 10 years. Compared with similar European surveys this survey reveals a higher implementations of physical methods such as intermittent pneumatic compression and elastic stockings. Because of the limited response rate and possibility of sampling bias, these findings should be interpreted with caution.",

The most frequently used modalities are intermittent pneumatic compression, low-dose heparin, and elastic stocking. A combination of physical and pharmacologic methods is used by one fourth of respondents, and only 50% start pharmacologic prophylaxis before the surgical procedure. The thrombosis risk factors that are most frequently considered by surgeons when deciding about using prophylaxis are history of venous thromboembolism, immobility, and length of operation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the retrievability of the Greenfield filter, to characterize fixation, and to evaluate the mechanical function of a new retrieval unit.\nStainless steel, titanium, and two prototype Greenfield filters (n = 82) were placed in 15 sheep at multiple sites and retrieved acutely, and 7, 14, and 21 days after placement. The animals were killed, and appropriate tissues were submitted for histopathologic evaluation.\nEighty-two percent of all filters were retrieved. Two animals died during the procedure of cardiac tamponade. Retrieval was easiest immediately after placement, but it was least successful from the right atrium and associated with the highest incidence of damage. By 21 days, the intima around the filter hooks had thickened with myointimal hyperplasia and variable amounts of endothelial regeneration. Guide wire-hook modification was used to improve filter capture.\nAll models of the Greenfield filter can be retrieved 14 to 21 days after placement, although there is high risk to retrieval from the right atrium and ventricle. The long-term safety of the Greenfield filter in man makes it difficult to justify removal in any but exceptional cases.",

    "abstract": "The objectives were to transplant a venous valve into the popliteal vein of a canine insufficiency model that would maintain long-term function and then to measure the hemodynamic benefit of such a valve.\nIndexes of venous valvular function, including venous filling time, 90% of venous refilling time, and simulated ambulatory venous pressure, were measured in 11 greyhounds before intervention (Control) and after hind limb venous valvulotomy, which produces chronic venous insufficiency. Three weeks later a valve-containing segment of external jugular vein was transplanted to the popliteal vein with (n = 6) or without (n = 5) a distal arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was ligated in 4 to 6 weeks. Repeat venous indexes were obtained an average of 2 weeks after the last operative intervention. Gross anatomic inspection +/- duplex scanning performed before the animals were killed were used to distinguished normal from damaged valves.\nFour of five simple valve transplants demonstrated scarring and/or thrombosis and the average venous filling time, ambulatory venous pressure, and 90% of venous refilling time were consistent with chronic venous insufficiency and/or obstruction. One fistula failed in the six valve distal arteriovenous fistula transplants, and that valve was incompetent. Analysis of the remaining five functional valves demonstrated venous filling time consistent with chronic venous insufficiency, normalization of ambulatory venous pressure, and 90% of venous refilling time between normal, and chronic venous insufficiency. These valves appeared normal.\nPopliteal vein valve transplant anatomy is preserved by an adjunctive distal arteriovenous fistula, and a competent valve transplant improves postexercise venous hemodynamics to approach those of a normal limb.",

    "abstract": "Little data are available concerning the relation between the muscular pumping mechanism and the variation of superficial and deep venous pressure during normal action of the calf pump; therefore we undertook this study to determine the pressure values in three compartments of the calf and in the deep and the superficial venous system and to establish correlation between muscular and venous pressure.\nNine healthy young women with a mean age of 23 years (range 19 to 28 years) were examined. In the same calf, a muscular catheter was placed in the deep posterior compartment (DPC), in the superficial posterior compartment (SPC), and in the anterior tibial compartment (ATC), and a vascular catheter was placed in the popliteal vein and in the greater saphenous vein (GSV). The five lines of pressure were simultaneously recorded in the following situations: at rest, during Valsalva maneuver, foot flexion, and foot extension. The situation was studied with the patient in the following positions: decubitus, sitting, standing, and squatting. A final continuous recording was carried out after the patient had been walking for 5 minutes.\nMean values with standard errors of muscular and venous pressure were established in each situation. At rest and during Valsalva maneuver, the muscular pressures did not vary, whereas venous pressures increased significantly when the patient was sitting and standing. On the other hand, squatting was associated with a rise in the muscular and vein pressures. Foot flexion entailed a significant increase in the ATC pressure and a rise in the GSV pressure, whereas foot extension caused the DPC pressure to rise without venous pressure modifications. Walking was associated with an alternating increase in the DPC, SPC, GSV and popliteal vein pressures when the foot was compressed to floor followed by a significant decrease when the foot pressure was released.\nThe variations in the deep and superficial venous pressures when the patient is sitting and standing both at rest and during Valsalva maneuver are not associated with an increase in the muscular pressure. On the contrary, during foot movements, the ATC and the DPC are responsible for superficial vein pressure variations without modifications of the SPC pressure.",

Ten limbs (group 1) were clinically without any venous disease. Group 2 consisted of 10 limbs with severe, class 3 venous stasis. Duplex ultrasonography, complemented with Doppler color-flow imaging was used to examine the superficial and deep venous systems to identify reflux.\nUltrasonography identified deep venous reflux in eight of 10 limbs in group 2. Severe superficial reflux was identified in the two remaining limbs. Seven limbs with deep reflux also demonstrated severe superficial reflux. Superficial venous reflux was identified in one leg in group 1. APG accurately separated normal limbs from those with reflux.

PPG refill times were significantly shortened in group 2 versus those of group 1 (6.4 +/- 0.89 sec vs 20.2 +/- 1.1 sec). The sensitivity of PPG refill times to identify reflux was 100%, but the specificity was only 60%, whereas the sensitivity and specificity for the residual volume fraction was 100%. The venous filling index was able to identify reflux and determine whether only superficial reflux was present with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90%. The kappa coefficient of agreement between duplex scanning and APG was 0.83, whereas between duplex and PPG it was only 0.47.\nAPG accurately identifies limbs with and without venous reflux when compared with duplex ultrasonography. APG is a better method of evaluating clinically significant venous reflux than PPG. PPG is a sensitive method of detecting reflux, but the specificity is poor, and PPG refill times cannot accurately predict the location of reflux.

    "abstract": "To achieve uniform testing of venous reflux between institutions, comparable methods of testing by duplex scanning are desired. This study directly examines differences of testing by two techniques, Valsalva and rapid cuff deflation, performed in two positions: 15-degree reverse Trendelenburg (RT-15) and standing.\nDuplex examination of 22 extremities in 19 patients with moderate to severe, class 2 and 3 chronic venous insufficiency symptoms were compared with duplex scanning of 21 limbs in 11 normal, healthy volunteers. Duration of retrograde flow and peak velocity were measured in 247 venous segments. All extremities were studied in four ways: RT-15 Valsalva, standing Valsalva, RT-15 cuff, and standing cuff. Reflux was defined as duration of retrograde flow or reflux time greater than 0.5 seconds. Six venous segments were examined: common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, and greater saphenous in the upper thigh, popliteal, and posterior tibial (at the ankle).\nThe results of testing the Valsalva technique and the cuff in both the RT-15 and standing non-weight bearing positions indicate that the Valsalva method is best performed in the RT-15 position as opposed to standing, whereas the cuff technique is more effective in the standing position. In symptomatic limbs, the RT-15 Valsalva method showed similar proportion of reflux in the upper thigh when compared with the standing cuff method: common femoral (90% vs 67%), superficial femoral (81% vs 71%), greater saphenous (88% vs 59%), and deep femoral veins (30% vs 15%). In the popliteal vein the standing cuff test showed similar proportion of reflux (77%) as compared with the RT-15 Valsalva test (68%); however, a case-by-case analysis identified a large amount of variability between techniques, and inconsistencies could not be used to identify one technique as better than the other. Examination of the posterior tibial veins by all methods produced inconsistencies and a low yield of reflux in symptomatic limbs. In the common femoral vein, RT-15 Valsalva testing produced reflux times of up to 1.5 seconds in normal limbs, and represented \"physiologic reflux.\" There was no recognizable effect of iliac vein valves on testing distal venous segments by Valsalva maneuver.\nReflux in the upper thigh veins--common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, and greater saphenous-is similarly demonstrated in both normal and symptomatic states by cuff deflation and RT-15 Valsalva techniques. In the popliteal vein, discrepancies between these two techniques are identified in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, and tibial vein reflux is not well demonstrated by either technique. Further investigation is needed to determine ideal techniques for identifying popliteal and tibial vein reflux.",

    "abstract": "Leg elevation is advised in the treatment of venous disease associated with edema. We have used laser Doppler fluxmetry to assess the effects of leg elevation on the skin microcirculation.\nFifteen patients with lipodermatosclerosis caused by chronic venous insufficiency and 15 control subjects were studied. Measurements were made from the liposclerotic skin of patients and 8 cm above the medial malleolus in control subjects. Laser Doppler flux, blood cell velocity, and concentration of moving blood cells were recorded with the subject lying in the supine position and after elevating the foot 30 cm above the heart level.\nIn subjects in the horizontal position, the resting laser Doppler flux was significantly higher in patients with lipodermatosclerosis than in control subjects (median difference 63 arbitrary units; 95% confidence interval: 36, 108). This difference was due to a higher concentration of moving blood cells in the patient group (median difference 6.5 arbitrary units; 95% confidence interval: 3.4, 9). The blood cell velocity was not statistically significant between the two groups. On leg elevation, there was a substantial increase in the laser Doppler flux in the patient group; the median percentage increase in flux was 45% (p < 0.01). This was due to an increase in blood cell velocity; the median percentage increase was 41% (p < 0.01). There was no corresponding change in the concentration of moving blood cells. The results in the control group showed a similar trend but have not reached statistical significance.\nWe conclude that limb elevation enhanced the microcirculatory flow velocity in liposclerotic skin of patients with chronic venous insufficiency.",

Secondary goals were (1) to evaluate the use of the vascular laboratory and (2) to characterize our patient population with deep vein thrombosis and to identify a subset of patients with uncomplicated deep vein thrombosis who might be candidates for outpatient therapy in the future.\nA retrospective review was performed for all patients with deep vein thrombosis diagnosed with duplex scanning who were treated as inpatients from January 1993 through March 1993.\nFifty-four (16%) of 306 duplex scans were positive; 50 patients were treated as inpatients. Forty percent of patients had uncomplicated deep vein thrombosis that was potentially treatable on an outpatient basis. Mean time to obtain a therapeutic partial thromboplastin time was 22 hours (range 4 to 54 hours). Ten (20%) patients had inferior vena cava filters placed. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4%. Management problems occurred in 18 (36%) patients and included difficulty titrating anticoagulation, (10) physician failure to provide treatment after diagnosis, (five) and inappropriate use or complication of inferior vena cava filter placement (three).\nVenous duplex examination is liberally but appropriately used. The primary remediable problem resulting in suboptimal management is difficulty titrating anticoagulation; inappropriate placement of inferior vena cava filters and physician failure to provide treatment also occur. In the future a substantial number of patients may be suitable for outpatient therapy.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate progress in diagnosis, management, and clinical outcome of mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT).\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 72 patients treated for mesenteric venous thrombosis between 1972 and 1993.\nFifty-three patients had acute and 19 had chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis. Fifty-seven patients had secondary mesenteric venous thrombosis; previous abdominal surgical procedure and hypercoagulable states were the most prevalent associated conditions. Computed tomography was abnormal in all patients who underwent this test for acute mesenteric venous thrombosis and in 93% of those who had chronic disease. Angiography diagnosed acute mesenteric venous thrombosis in five (72%) of seven patients. Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis presented most frequently as abdominal pain (83%), anorexia (53%), and diarrhea (43%). Thirty-three (75%) had symptoms longer than 48 hours. Thirty-four (64%) patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis underwent a surgical procedure. Bowel resection was necessary in 31 patients. One patient had unsuccessful mesenteric venous thrombectomy. Seven patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis underwent anticoagulation without a surgical procedure, and 12 were observed. All patients with chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis were observed; nine of the 19 underwent anticoagulation. The median delay in diagnosis for patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis was 48 hours and did not decrease during the last decade. Mesenteric venous thrombosis recurred in 19 (36%) patients. The 30-day mortality was 27%. Long-term survival of patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis was significantly worse than that of those with chronic disease (36% vs 83% survival at 3 years). The patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis who underwent anticoagulation with and without surgical procedure had improved survival when compared with the observed group.\nAcute mesenteric venous thrombosis remains a lethal disease. Mortality has not improved in the last 22 years. Computed tomography is the most sensitive diagnostic test. Anticoagulation and surgical procedure enhanced survival in the acute subgroup.

Both groups also had varicose tributaries of GSV avulsed through multiple stab incisions.\nIn the HL-A group two GSV (13%) remained completely patent, 10 GSV (62.5%) thrombosed partially, and the remaining four GSV (25%) had complete thrombosis. In the PVBV-A group 12 GSV (80%) remained completely patent and without reflux, one GSV (7%) remained patent but showing reflux. Two GSV (13%) thrombosed completely. There were no surgical complications or recurrences (mean follow-up was 9.4 months for PVBV-A and 9.5 months for HL-A), and the postoperative recovery time was similar for both groups.\nBoth techniques are equally effective in the early elimination of varicosities. Preservation of the saphenous vein is significantly better after PVBV-A (p < 0.01). A prospective randomized trial with long-term follow-up is required.",

The possible involvement of the plasmin cascade in the activation of these proteinases was also explored by examining the presence of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in aneurysm wall.\nImmunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the presence of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 proteins and uPA in fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from AAA (n = 10) and control (n = 2) aortas.\nThe MMP-9 protein was localized to mononuclear cells in the AAA wall. Dual-labeling techniques confirmed the identity of these cells as macrophages. The MMP-3 protein and uPA were also detected primarily in the macrophage-like mononuclear cells infiltrating the aneurysmal aorta. Immunoreactive material to MMP-1 was demonstrated in mesenchymal cells of the AAA wall suggesting alternative expression and delivery of this enzyme in AAA.\nThis work establishes the role of macrophages in the delivery, expression, and possible activation of matrix destructive proteinases during AAA pathogenesis and suggests a role for the activation of MMPs in the progression of the disease.",

Six weeks after implantation, blood flow through the graft was measured. Rings cut from grafts were suspended for the measurement of isometric force in organ chambers to determine endothelial function.\nBlood flow was significantly greater in grafts with a distal fistula compared to grafts with normal or decreased flow. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were absent in all grafts. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to adenosine diphosphate, thrombin, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were less in grafts with reduced flow compared with grafts with increased flow. Relaxations to these agents in grafts with increased flow were reduced by an analog of L-arginine. Neointimal hyperplasia was increased in grafts with reduced flow.\nThese data demonstrate that chronic diminution of blood flow decreases receptor-mediated release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors and increases neointimal hyperplasia in canine vein grafts. The production of endothelium-derived relaxing factors, one of which is nitric oxide, may influence the development of myointimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.",

After formation of the posterior communicating artery from the caudal branch of the internal carotid artery, the presegmental arteries are generally obliterated. Rarely, however, these primitive carotid-basilar anastomoses will persist into adult life, and may be detected as incidental findings at the time of cerebral angiography during evaluation of the patient with suspected cerebrovascular disease. In addition, persistence of such anastomoses may result in the coexistence of anterior and posterior circulation symptoms, precipitating diagnostic confusion. Two patients with symptoms and persistent hypoglossal artery undergoing carotid thromboendarterectomy are discussed, with emphasis on clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria and intraoperative management.",

    "abstract": "Positional popliteal artery obstruction is believed to be an important factor contributing to popliteal artery entrapment syndromes. This study was undertaken to define the positional anatomy and physiologic condition of the vessels in the popliteal fossa in groups of highly trained and normally active young men and women. We postulate that at least some symptom-free individuals can occlude the popliteal artery with leg positioning.\nSeventy-two limbs were evaluated in 36 subjects. Symptom-free subjects were recruited in four groups: normally active men, normally active women, male competitive runners, and female competitive runners. All subjects underwent noninvasive testing that included resting segmental limb pressures and Doppler waveforms and color-flow duplex imaging with the leg in the neutral position and then with knee extension with active and passive dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot. Subjects unable to occlude the popliteal artery with positioning were then exercised, and studies were repeated. Magnetic resonance imaging, with magnetic resonance angiography, was conducted on 14 subjects, with each leg studied in the neutral position and with active positioning.\nPositional popliteal arterial occlusion occurred in 38 of 72 limbs (53%). No intergroup comparisons were statistically significant. The response of each leg was symmetric in 89% of subjects. No subject who could not occlude the popliteal artery at rest was able to do so with exercise. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed normal anatomy in all subjects and showed the location of popliteal occlusion to be at the level of the soleal sling, with positional compression by the soleus muscle, the lateral head of the gastrocnemius, the plantaris, and popliteus muscles.\nPopliteal arterial occlusion can be induced in 53% of subjects with simple leg positioning caused by myofascial compression. This must be considered when evaluating patients for intervention on the basis of physiologic testing of the popliteal vessels.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate a recently introduced form of stripping of primary varicose veins by the technique of perforate-invaginate (PIN) stripping.\nOne hundred twelve consecutive limbs presenting with 91 long and 21 short saphenous varicosities displaying saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junctional escapes with varying length of greater or lesser saphenous (axial) reflux underwent operation in 1 year. All surgeries were performed in an office setting with the patient receiving locoregional anesthetic with use of the invaginated PIN stripping in conjunction with tributary hook-stab avulsion.\nIn the 112 procedures performed, there were no tract hematomas or dysesthesias caused by nerve damage. Postoperative morbidity was nonexistent, permitting all patients to resume normal daily occupational and sporting activities immediately.\nPIN stripping is an excellent method of invagination stripping. There is a minimal likelihood of vein tearing. Compared with conventional ankle-to-groin (or popliteal fossa) stripping, PIN stripping is minimally invasive, does not cause damage to structures around the vein, does not require convalescence, eliminates the need for a lengthy distal second incision, can be performed in an office setting with the patient receiving locoregional anesthetic, and is most cost-efficient.",

    "abstract": "A previous study has shown age- and sex-related differences in abdominal aortic compliance. In that study blood pressure determined by auscultation in the brachial artery was assumed to be equal to blood pressure in the abdominal aorta. To validate our findings we investigated the pressure-diameter (P-D) relationship of the abdominal aorta.\nDiameter and pulsatile diameter change of the abdominal aorta were determined noninvasively by an ultrasound phase-locked echo-tracking system with simultaneous measurement of aortic pressure resulting in P-D curves in 27 healthy male and female volunteers 23 to 72 years of age. The degree of error in aortic compliance as calculated from blood pressure determined by auscultation of the brachial artery rather than from direct measurement of aortic pressure was evaluated. Compliance was defined as the inverse of pressure strain elastic modulus (Ep) or of stiffness (beta).\nThere was no significant difference in the systolic pressure at the two sites, but the diastolic pressure was systematically overestimated by approximately 10 mm Hg when determined by the auscultatory method (p < 0.01) leading to a 15% to 20% underestimation of Ep and stiffness (beta). The individual P-D curves exhibited hysteresis, were nonlinear, and revealed that the aorta is more distensible at lower than at higher pressures. The steepness of the P-D curve decreased with increasing age and this occurred at an earlier age in men than in women.\nThis investigation demonstrates a decrease in abdominal aortic wall distensibility with age, which occurs at an earlier age in men, and confirms earlier results by use of the indexes Ep and stiffness (beta). This implies that the abdominal aorta in men is more prone to degenerative changes, which may be one of the factors responsible for the sex difference in aortic vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and extent of valvular incompetence in patients with reflux confined to the superficial venous system and correlate the extent of such reflux with clinical symptoms and signs.\nTwo hundred fifty-five limbs of 217 patients with superficial venous insufficiency and normal perforating and deep veins were examined with color-flow duplex imaging. One hundred twenty-three limbs (48.2%) of 102 patients had reflux confined to the long saphenous system, 83 limbs (32.6%) of 72 patients had reflux confined to the the short saphenous system, and 49 limbs (19.2%) of 43 patients had reflux in both long and short saphenous systems.\nIn the long saphenous system the commonest pattern of reflux was that which extended throughout the length of long saphenous vein (LSV) (47%). Ache, swelling, and skin changes were common in the presence of below knee reflux irrespective whether the thigh segment was involved. Ulceration (8%) was found only in limbs with reflux extending throughout the length of LSV. In the short saphenous system the most common pattern of reflux extended throughout the length of short saphenous vein (SSV) (57%) without involvement of Giacomini or gastrocnemial veins. Ache and swelling were present in 62% and 72% of the limbs, but this incidence was not related to the extent of reflux. Swelling, skin changes, and ulceration occurred only when the whole of the SSV was involved. In the limbs with reflux in both the long and short saphenous systems, the most common pattern of reflux extended throughout the length of both systems (45%). In these limbs the incidence of swelling was 80%. The incidence of skin changes went from 44% when the below-knee segment of the LSV was involved to 73% when reflux occurred throughout the LSV and SSV. Ulceration (14%) was found only in the latter situation. Variable patterns of saphenogastrocnemial termination were seen. In 57.8% of the limbs SSV joined the popliteal vein just above the popliteal crease, whereas the SSV terminated in the thigh in 26.6%.\nWe conclude that ache, ankle edema, and skin changes in limbs with reflux confined to the superficial venous system are predominantly associated with reflux in the below-knee veins. Ulceration is found only when the whole of the LSV is involved (8%) or when reflux is extensive in both LSV and SSV (14%).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to present the use of superficial femoral vein (SFV) as an arterial bypass graft when ipsilateral saphenous vein is inadequate.\nData collected prospectively were reviewed on 24 patients (25 limbs) who had an arterial bypass with SFV performed by the authors between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1991. Many anatomic sites are represented. The indication for operation was gangrene in six patients, severe rest pain or ulceration in 11, mild to moderate rest pain in six, and graft infection in two. There had been 42 previous reconstructions in these 25 limbs.\nThere has been surprisingly little long-term disability from removal of the SFV. Immediately after surgery four limbs developed acute venous congestion that resolved quickly. Twenty percent of the patients with patent grafts have continued to wear a pressure gradient stocking for swelling 1 year after surgery, one patient requires additional pressure to control induration. All grafts were patent at 30 days. During a mean follow-up of 2 years, three grafts have required revision, and three have occluded. Stenosis did not develop at valve sites or in the body of the SFV portion of any of these grafts. There were two deaths from heart-related causes in the first 30 days after operation. Life-table analysis for the whole group shows a primary patency rate of 66% (SE 10.3%) and an assisted patency rate of 80% (SE 8.7%) at 2 years.\nSFV harvest is well tolerated, even in the absence of ipsilateral saphenous vein. The magnitude of the operation is greater than saphenous vein harvest but yields a thick-walled vein of excellent diameter with many applications as an autogenous conduit, particularly where a large-diameter graft is indicated.",

The homocysteine-lowering effect of combined treatment with vitamin B6 plus folic acid has never been explored in a large group of patients with vascular disease. Therefore we studied the effects of at least 6 weeks treatment with these vitamins in 72 patients with cardiovascular disease and mild hyperhomocysteinemia (defined as an increase of the plasma homocysteine level after methionine loading greater than 97.5 percentile of age-matched control subjects but less than 200 mumol/L).\nThe existence of mild hyperhomocysteinemia was investigated in 309 consecutive patients under 50 years of age with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, cerebral arterial occlusive disease, or coronary artery occlusive disease. All patients with an abnormal loading test result were treated with vitamin B6, 250 mg daily, plus folic acid, 5 mg daily. After 6 weeks of treatment a second methionine loading test was performed to assess the homocysteine-lowering effect.\nMild hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 72 patients (23%), 33 (46%) of whom also had hyperhomocysteinemia when fasting. Treatment with vitamin B6 plus folic acid normalized the postload plasma homocysteine concentration in 66 of the 72 patients (92%), whereas fasting hyperhomocysteinemia was normalized in 30 of 33 (91%) patients. In six patients therapy failed to achieve normalization of the postload homocysteine levels. In three of these patients, the same treatment was continued for an additional 6 weeks, and in the remaining three patients betaine was added to the treatment regimen. After 6 weeks of additional treatment all six patients had normal postload plasma homocysteine concentrations.\nThe prevalence of mild hyperhomocysteinemia in young patients with arterial occlusive disease is high. Simple and inexpensive therapy with vitamin B6 plus folic acid will normalize homocysteine metabolism, as assessed by the homocysteine plasma level after methionine loading, in virtually all these patients.",

    "abstract": "Acute arterial thrombosis associated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a rare but limb-threatening complication. The purpose of this report was to determine the incidence and optimal management of these complications by reviewing our extensive orthopedic experience and the English-language literature.\nBetween April 1989 and March 1994 seven (0.17%) patients had development of acute limb-threatening ischemia after 4097 TKAs that were performed at our hospital. Management of these complications included (1) emergency arteriography to define inflow and outflow arteries, (2) use of autologous vein from the contralateral leg when arterial bypasses were necessary (because TKAs are associated with a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis), and (3) early, aggressive revascularization that often required difficult distal bypasses to achieve limb salvage. Management of our cases are compared with treatment of 13 patients described in the literature.\nTen patients treated at other hospitals by arterial thrombectomy alone (six cases), sympathectomy alone (two cases), fasciotomy alone (one case) or delayed arterial bypass resulted in seven major amputations and one death. All seven of our patients and three patients treated elsewhere underwent emergency femorodistal bypasses (six tibial, three below-knee popliteal, one pedal). All 10 patients had limb salvage after long-term follow-up (average 18 months; range 1 to 58).\nThrombectomy alone for acute arterial thrombosis associated with TKA generally is unsuccessful and associated with unacceptably high amputation rates. Dismal results without emergency bypass is due to underlying chronic occlusive atherosclerotic disease found in these patients and intimal plaque disruption that can occur with knee manipulation or tourniquet compression. Acute arterial occlusion after TKA is best managed by emergency arteriography and a femoroinfrageniculate bypass.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of sex on the survival rate and complications after repair of nonruptured and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nThe Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery Aneurysm Registry formed the database for analysis and provided current, ongoing follow-up of the patients. Statistical methods included t tests, chi-squared analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis.\nOf the 679 patients undergoing repair of a nonruptured AAA, 19.7% were women and 82.3% men. The following risk factors were significantly different (p < 0.05) in women and men: women were older; more had never smoked; more had a positive family history of AAA; fewer had an electrocardiogram showing evidence of an old myocardial infarction; more had coexisting aortoiliac occlusive disease; fewer had popliteal or femoral aneurysms; and the average size of the AAA was smaller. In spite of potential differences in risk, the in-hospital mortality rates were not affected by sex: 5.2% mortality rate for women and 4.4% for men. Early and late vascular complications occurred with a similar prevalence. The late survival rates were not different in women and men: for women, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 93.0%, 74.2%, and 63.3%, respectively, and for men 90.3%, 82.8%, and 68.9%. To control for the potential effects of other confounding variables on survival, the Cox proportional hazards method was used. When sex was included in a model along with other significant predictive variables of late survival, sex was not found to be a significant predictor of late results. Of the 146 patients with a ruptured AAA, 13.7% were women and 83.3% men. The in-hospital mortality rates were not significantly different: 55.0% for women and 49.2% for men. There was no difference between the cumulative survival rates: the 3- and 5-year survival rates for women were 36.0% and 9.0%, respectively, and for men 33.9% and 26.9%.\nSex was not found to have an effect on the early or late results after repair of nonruptured or ruptured AAA. However, a literature review suggests the possibility of a gender bias in the diagnosis and/or selection of patients for surgical treatment because the proportion of women in surgical series is generally less than the proportion determined from autopsy studies, ultrasound studies, hospital discharge data, and national mortality information.",

    "abstract": "Historically, most infrainguinal bypasses originated from the common femoral artery. In spite of sporadic reports of the use of the deep femoral artery as an inflow source, its durability has not been critically reviewed.\nFrom 1977 to 1994, 2829 infrainguinal reconstructions have been performed. Of these, 563 (20%) procedures have been performed with the deep femoral artery used as the inflow source. The indication for operation was limb salvage in 91.5% of cases. Four hundred eleven procedures were performed with use of the saphenous vein in situ, 48 were performed with partial in situ vein, and 75 were performed with excised (translocated) vein (29 other). When the deep femoral artery was relatively disease free, it was accessed through a lateral or standard inguinal approach. Reasons given for the use of the deep femoral artery were inadequate vein length, concomitant inflow procedures, prior groin dissections, and occluded superficial femoral artery.\nThe 1- and 5-year secondary patency rates for all bypasses with the deep femoral artery were 90.4% and 76.9%, respectively, as compared with 88% and 73.3% for common femoral artery-based bypasses. Sixty-five patients (11.5%) had concomitant inflow procedures. All patients were monitored with serial noninvasive examinations, and data were collected from the vascular registry. Only eight patients (1.6%) required further inflow reconstructions for salvage of bypasses.\nThe hemodynamically unobstructed deep femoral artery is a reliable and durable inflow source for patients requiring infrainguinal bypasses. Its patency rates are comparable to those of the common femoral artery-based reconstructions in our experience.",

We sought to compare the characteristics of these patients with those of a randomly selected group of older patients with AA.\nWe identified 26 patients with AA (group I) under age 51 (mean age 44.8) treated surgically between 1977 and 1993, after excluding patients with acute aortic dissection, traumatic pseudoaneurysms, and ascending or arch aneurysms, and compared them with 75 randomly selected patients with AA between the ages of 65 and 75 (mean age 70.3) who were surgically treated during the same time period (group II).\nPrevalence of hypertension, diabetes, coexisting heart, kidney, or occlusive peripheral vascular disease was similar between the two groups, and familial aneurysm rates and sex distribution did not differ significantly. More patients in group I had symptoms at the time of presentation (46% vs 6.7%, p < 0.001), and they also had larger AAs (6.9 cm vs 6.0 cm, p = 0.01). Definable causes of aneurysmal disease, such as Takayasu's, Cogan's, and Marfan syndromes, were more common among the young patients (23% vs 0%, p = 0.01), but most (77%) young patients did not have an identifiable syndrome associated with their aneurysm disease. Group I had a marked shift toward proximal aneurysms, defined as involvement of juxtarenal, suprarenal, or thoracoabdominal aorta (46% vs 18% in group II, p < 0.01). This difference persisted even when aneurysms associated with the above syndromes were excluded from consideration (p = 0.02). Cigarette smoking was much more common among the young patients (83% vs 51% in group II, p < 0.01). Smoking in group II was associated with more extensive aneurysm disease (p = 0.04).\nAneurysmal disease presenting in the young adult is more likely to be symptomatic and associated with more proximal aortic involvement than aneurysmal disease in older patients. Smoking appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of aneurysmal disease in the young patient and was associated in our study with more proximal aneurysms among older patients. A subgroup of patients at risk for early and aggressive aneurysm disease is suggested by these data.",

    "abstract": "Patients with clinically evident chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated to relate the degree of insufficiency and calf muscle pump dysfunction to venous ulceration.\nSixty-nine limbs in 55 patients with chronic venous insufficiency by Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery Classification were compared in three groups: classes 1 and 2 with no history of ulceration (19 limbs); class 3 with healed ulceration (20 limbs); and class 3 with active ulcers (30 limbs). Air plethysmography measurements of outflow fraction, venous volume, venous filling time, venous filling index, ejection fraction, ejection volume, residual volume fraction, and residual volume were made. In 62 of the 69 limbs, color-flow duplex ultrasonography was used to determine the pattern of reflux.\nThe outflow fraction was normal in 84%, 75%, and 77% of nonulcerated, healed, and ulcerated limbs. The venous filling index was abnormal in most limbs (nonulcerated 95%, healed 90%, ulcerated 98%) but not significantly different among groups. Differences in calf muscle pump function were significant. Ulcerated limbs had significantly poorer ejection fractions (p = 0.0002) and greater residual volume fractions (p = 0.0006) than nonulcerated or healed limbs. By ultrasonography, deep and superficial vein incompetence was present in most limbs and was not statistically different among groups. Although venous insufficiency was not measurably different among groups, limbs with active venous ulcers had significantly poorer calf muscle pump function than those with healed ulcers or with no history of ulceration.\nVenous insufficiency is necessary but not sufficient to cause ulceration, and a deficiency of the calf muscle pump is significant to the severity of venous ulceration.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a developing technique that provides arteriograms without the risks associated with iodinated contrast and arterial puncture or the expense of hospitalization. Prior reports have demonstrated the accuracy of peripheral vessel MRA for evaluation of the aorta through pedal vessels. This study sought to determine whether vascular reconstructions could be planned and accomplished on the basis of MRA alone.\nEighty consecutive candidates for bypass with ischemic rest pain or tissue loss were studied with preoperative outpatient MRA of the juxtarenal aorta through the foot. Confirmation of MRA findings was provided by intraoperative intraarterial pressure measurements for proximal vessels and postbypass arteriography for the runoff. Life-table analysis of graft patency and limb salvage was performed.\nTwo patients could not tolerate MRA and required contrast arteriography, but all others underwent reconstructive procedures on the basis of MRA alone (11 aortobifemoral, 67 infrainguinal). Intraoperative findings regarding suitability of inflow and outflow vessels confirmed the accuracy of the MRAs in every case. MRA indicated that none of the patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass had significant inflow occlusive disease, and this was confirmed at operation with pressure measurements of inflow vessels that were always within 10 mm Hg (peak systolic) of systemic pressure. The results of intraoperative completion arteriography and preoperative MRAs were identical for all but two patients who had minor discrepancies. All aortobifemoral reconstructions remained patent, and all limbs remained intact. The infrainguinal reconstructions had an 84% limb salvage rate and 78% primary graft patency rate at 21 months. Comparison of charges for patients undergoing preoperative MRA versus contrast angiography showed a cost savings of $1288 for each patient treated with preoperative MRA alone.\nMRA is a noninvasive, cost-effective outpatient imaging technique that, if properly performed and interpreted, is sufficient for planning peripheral bypass procedures. Its use may supplant contrast arteriography in many patients.",
