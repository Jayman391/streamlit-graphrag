    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia following operations on the abdominal aorta is considered an unpredictable event attributable to variations in spinal cord blood supply. Our experience with seven cases of spinal cord ischemia contradicts this hypothesis. All patients had a bifurcation graft implanted. Three patients had bilateral interruption of hypogastric circulation. Each had gluteal necrosis and two had left colon ischemia. Two patients had unilateral hypogastric ligation. In both of these patients, early postoperative hypotension preceded recognition of spinal cord ischemia. Two patients without known interruption of hypogastric flow had proximal side-to-end anastomoses placed in an atheromatous aorta. Intraoperative peripheral emboli occurred in one and postoperative visceral emboli occurred in the other patient. In the latter case spinal cord ischemia occurred late concomitantly with embolization. The surmised important details in patients' courses with spinal cord ischemia are (1) interference with pelvic blood flow (five of seven patients) severe enough in three cases to cause gluteal necrosis and (2) a high incidence of perioperative complications. Interruption of an anomalous spinal artery was probably not a factor as cord lesions were mostly distal and no case of spinal cord ischemia occurred after a cylinder graft was placed. Spinal cord ischemia is potentially preventable. Our experience reemphasizes the importance of hypogastric perfusion, the dangers of handling the atheromatous aorta, and the necessity for avoiding postoperative hypotension.",

    "abstract": "The operative treatment of 77 patients with atherosclerotic aneurysms of the pararenal aorta (54 juxtarenal and 23 suprarenal) is analyzed. Repair of these complex lesions is formidable because of difficult exposure, renal ischemia and myocardial strain as a result of proximal aortic occlusion, and associated renal atherosclerosis with secondary renal functional impairment. Nineteen (25%) patients were normotensive with normal renal function. Sixteen patients (21%) had hypertension alone and 42 (54%) were hypertensive with abnormal renal function. There were multiple renal arteries in 22% of patients. Aortic reconstruction involved infrarenal graft in 27 patients (35%), infrarenal graft plus pararenal aortic endarterectomy (TEA) in 26 (34%), and infra- and pararenal aortic graft in 24 (31%). Twenty-two patients (30%) had normal renal arteries and therefore no renal reconstruction. Of the 55 patients who required combined aortic and renal artery repair, 24 required renal artery repair because of involvement of the renal arteries by the aneurysm and 31 because of atherosclerotic renal artery disease. TEA was the most common technique of renal artery repair (54 of 93 arteries, 58%), followed by reimplantation (18 arteries) and prosthetic graft (13). The perioperative mortality rate was 1.3%. The perioperative morbidity rate was 28% and consisted principally of renal insufficiency (23%). This was usually transient (44%) and (89%) mild. Renal morbidity was adversely affected by renal ischemia status, severity of renal artery disease and extent of renal revascularization. Following reconstruction, hypertension was cured or improved in 77% of patients and abnormal renal function was cured or improved in 46% and stabilized in an additional 39% of patients. These results show that combined aortic aneurysm repair and renal artery reconstruction can be performed with minimal mortality and an acceptable morbidity. Aggressive intraoperative monitoring is necessary to minimize myocardial complications. Careful attention must be paid to the technical details of the reconstruction, especially in minimizing renal ischemia, to reduce the subsequent incidence of renal function deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Inherent in any analysis of vascular surgical manpower must be accurate data on surgical rates and numbers of surgeons who perform vascular operations. For in-depth analysis of age-sex standardized vascular operative rates from 1979 to 1984 and a determination of current manpower levels, data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the American Board of Surgery (ABS) were reviewed. During 1979 to 1984, total vascular surgical procedures increased 50%. In 1983 such operations comprised 11% of all general surgical procedures and 3% of all operations performed in this country. In 1983, 95,000 carotid endarterectomies, 74,000 peripheral bypasses, were performed. Through November 1984, among approximately 1600 surgeons who had applied to take the General Vascular Surgery Examination, 676 took the examination and 545 passed. What percentage of all vascular surgeons these 1600 represent is unknown. Consequently, what percentage of the total vascular operative load their own experiences represent is uncertain. As of May 1985, the Residency Review Committee for General Surgery had approved 42 fellowship positions in 29 vascular training programs. How these training figures will change to meet optimal manpower requirements remains undefined. Although data concerning operative rates have become more precise, forecasting manpower needs will be met with skepticism because of unknown current and future numbers of vascular surgeons and their average caseloads. Regardless of these uncertainties, vascular surgeons, program directors, and health analysts should be aware of such information because until we know how many vascular surgeons are necessary to provide optimal care, training and certification can not rationally evolve.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic vascular injuries to the subclavian and axillary vessels are often associated with permanent neurologic impairment either by direct injury to the brachial plexus or by compression from an expanding hematoma. Prompt decompression of the plexus by evacuation of the hematoma may avoid permanent neurologic damage and decrease the morbidity of these injuries. We reviewed our experience with these injuries with particular reference to the effect of early decompression of the brachial plexus. From 1963 to 1984 we treated 40 patients. The causes of the injuries were penetrating trauma in 85% and blunt trauma in 15%. The results of arterial repair were excellent with only two failed repairs; neither resulted in severe ischemia. Two patients were suspected of having thrombosed venous repairs. Among the 12 patients with direct injury to the brachial plexus (partial or complete transection), only six had subsequent improvement of their neurologic dysfunction. In contrast, six of seven patients in whom there was only compression of the plexus by hematoma but no direct injury, had neurologic improvement following evacuation of the hematoma. This finding suggests that prompt decompression of the brachial plexus following these injuries may reduce the amount of neurologic impairment and reduce the morbidity of these injuries.",

Gross morphologic examination, light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the umbilical vein grafts appeared to be fragile and easily delaminated. Bacteremic colonization on the luminal surface was present in the grafts removed because of infections but in two instances had extended into the wall. The presence of lipid on the surface and in the subintimal layer was observed in five grafts, three of which had been implanted for less than 1 month. We concluded that human umbilical vein grafts pathologically exhibit fragility, biodegradation, lipid accumulation, and bacterial colonization in infected cases, and these characteristics may adversely affect the durability and long-term success of the prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "The histopathologic characteristics of primary plaques and recurrent carotid disease were studied in 32 patients. These data were related to symptoms, recurrence interval (6 to 176 months), arteriographic anatomy, and in situ operative findings. A striking predilection was noted for recurrent lesions to be located in the internal carotid artery near the origin, but still within the confines, of the original endarterectomy site and suture line. Although recurrence was frequently associated with a long primary arteriotomy, evidence of technical faults or periarterial fibrosis was rare. Early recurrent lesions (recurrence interval less than 36 months, n = 13) had significantly more smooth muscle cells and proteoglycans (p less than 0.001) than late recurrent lesions (recurrence interval greater than 36 months, n = 19). As previously reported, features of atherosclerosis (abundant collagen, calcium deposits, and foam cells) were more pronounced in late recurrences (p less than 0.001). However, the histopathologic differentiation between early and late recurrent carotid disease was indistinct. A continuum was noted whereby characteristics of late recurrent lesions increased in proportion to recurrence interval. All recurrent lesions were easily distinguished from primary plaques in that recurrences had a less orderly arrangement of all elements and lacked the classic topographic features of advanced atherosclerosis. An important feature that differentiated primary and recurrent lesions was the presence of surface and intraplaque thrombus in 90% of recurrent lesions (p less than 0.001). In early recurrent disease, luminal surface thrombus was striking; this was frequently platelet-rich and showed organization devoid of neovascularity. Intraplaque thrombus was more common in late recurrent disease, consisted almost entirely of fibrin, and was often contiguous with luminal surface thrombus. No discernible relationships were noted between thrombus associated with recurrent lesions and the presence or absence of symptoms, treatment with antiplatelet agents, and hypertension. This finding suggests that thrombus was a continuous and intrinsic component of recurrent disease rather than a secondary, complicating feature. Recurrent carotid disease is a progressive lesion that stems from ongoing thrombogenesis occurring at the endarterectomy site. Organized thrombus and smooth muscle cell proliferation comprise the bulk of the lesion, which undergoes atherosclerotic change with time.",

    "abstract": "The records of 122 patients who underwent Doppler evaluation for the postphlebitic syndrome were reviewed to determine the relationship between location of venous valvular incompetence and severity of clinical signs. Categorized according to the most severe physical finding, there were 35 limbs with perimalleolar ulcers, 113 with stasis pigmentation, 26 with swelling, and 70 with no overt signs. Incompetent veins, either deep or superficial, were present in 93% of the symptomatic and 59% of the asymptomatic limbs. Proximal (iliofemoral) deep venous incompetence was not strongly correlated with disease severity (p less than 0.10), but distal (popliteotibial) deep venous and superficial venous incompetence were (both, p less than 0.0005). The relative frequency of isolated proximal incompetence appeared to diminish with increasing disease severity; whereas that of distal incompetence, with or without associated proximal venous incompetence, increased. Isolated proximal venous incompetence was found in only 5% of limbs with severe disease (ulcers or pigmentation). In limbs with severe signs, distal venous incompetence was present in 67% of those with proximal venous incompetence and in 57% of those in which the proximal valves were competent. These findings cast doubt on the potential value of proximal venous valvular reconstruction, especially in limbs with combined proximal and distal insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Laser-assisted arterial and venous anastomoses are now feasible. A microscope-guided CO2 laser was used to deliver 60 to 100 mW to anastomose end to end 44 rabbit carotid arteries (1.5 to 2.0 mm) and 27 rabbit vena cavae (4 to 6 mm). These were compared with control arteries repaired with interrupted suture technique. Anastomoses were examined from between 24 hours and 19 weeks. Laser carotid anastomoses yielded 93% patency (41 of 44) and 9% aneurysms (4 of 44), whereas hand-sewn carotid anastomoses produced 91% patency (40 of 44) and no aneurysms. In the vena cava, 26 of 27 laser anastomoses were patent (96%) compared with 19 of 20 (95%) sutured controls. Venous aneurysmal dilatation was seen in 2 of 27 laser (7%) and in 3 of 20 (15%) hand-sewn anastomoses. Histologic examination of laser-assisted anastomoses showed local full-thickness thermal injury. Repair was by fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation, and luminal cell coverage was complete by 14 days in both laser and sutured repairs. Laser arterial and venous anastomoses are attractive because of their simplicity and rapidity of performance. Their patency is comparable to sutured anastomoses, but arterial aneurysms remain a hazard despite use of extremely low laser energy.",

    "abstract": "An orderly diagnostic approach is needed to establish specific anatomic and etiologic diagnoses in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. It begins with the history and physical examination, including Doppler examination of the veins, in the office. When the severity of the problem warrants further investigation, the vascular laboratory can be used to assess the degree of physiologic change via pressure, volume, and flow studies. Diagnosis of obstructive and incompetent states can be established, and the one distinguished from the other. Ascending phlebography is used to demonstrate the anatomy of the veins, competence of the perforators, and the presence of postthrombotic deep vein changes. Descending phlebography is used in selected cases to diagnose specific incompetence of the valves in the superficial femoral, deep femoral, and greater saphenous veins. A complete venous evaluation defines which veins are patent, where the valves are located and if they are competent, and provides physiologic pressure and volume studies to correlate with the clinical state. Problems caused by primary valve incompetence are separated from those caused by postthrombotic recanalization or occlusion. On the basis of these findings, specific therapy can be tailored to the problem at hand.",

Isotope lymphography is simple and 95% accurate for defining deficient lymph clearance. It is particularly useful for separating venous from lymphatic edema. Definition of the precise abnormality--peripheral lymphatic obliteration, proximal lymph node obstruction, or valvular incompetence--can only be made with lymphangiography. The mainstay of treatment is the reduction of edema by regular elevation and massage and external compression with elastic stockings. Pneumatic leggings are also helpful. Gross edema caused by peripheral obliteration may be reduced surgically by simple excision (Homans' operation) or complete excision and skin grafting (Charles' operation). Reflux through incompetent vessels may be prevented by vessel ligation. Obstruction by the iliac lymph nodes may be bypassed with an enteromesenteric pedicle.",

    "abstract": "Autologous saphenous vein (ASV) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts were compared in 845 infrainguinal bypass operations, 485 to the popliteal artery and 360 to infrapopliteal arteries. Life-table primary patency rates for randomized PTFE grafts to the popliteal artery paralleled those for randomized ASV grafts to the same level for 2 years and then became significantly different (4-year patency rate of 68% +/- 8% [SE] for ASV vs. 47% +/- 9% for PTFE, p less than 0.025). Four-year patency differences for randomized above-knee grafts were not statistically significant (61% +/- 12% for ASV vs. 38% +/- 13% for PTFE, p greater than 0.25) but were for randomized below-knee grafts (76% +/- 9% for ASV vs. 54% +/- 11% for PTFE, p less than 0.05). Four-year limb salvage rates after bypasses to the popliteal artery to control critical ischemia did not differ for the two types of randomized grafts (75% +/- 10% for ASV vs. 70% +/- 10% for PTFE, p greater than 0.25). Although primary patency rates for randomized and obligatory PTFE grafts to the popliteal artery were significantly different (p less than 0.025), 4-year limb salvage rates were not (70% +/- 10% vs. 68% +/- 20%, p greater than 0.25). Primary patency rates at 4 years for infrapopliteal bypasses with randomized ASV were significantly better than those with randomized PTFE (49% +/- 10% vs. 12% +/- 7%, p less than 0.001). Limb salvage rates at 3 1/2 years for infrapopliteal bypasses with both randomized grafts (57% +/- 10% for ASV and 61% +/- 10% for PTFE) were better than those for obligatory infrapopliteal PTFE grafts (38% +/- 11%, p less than 0.01). These results fail to support the routine preferential use of PTFE grafts for either femoropopliteal or more distal bypasses. However, this graft may be used preferentially in selected poor-risk patients for femoropopliteal bypasses, particularly those that do not cross the knee. Although every effort should be made to use ASV for infrapopliteal bypasses, a PTFE distal bypass is a better option than a primary major amputation.",

    "abstract": "Successful development of a vascular prosthesis lined with endothelium may depend on the ability of the attached cells to resist shear forces after implantation. The purpose of this article is to describe a model for measurement of endothelial detachment caused by shear stress and to identify biomaterials that resist loss of attached cells as a result of shear stress. With human umbilical venous endothelium labeled with indium 111-oxine, cellular attachment to uncoated and fibronectin-coated polyester elastomer and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) graft surfaces was quantified after an 18-hour incubation. PTFE grafts prepared by immediate seeding were also studied. The relative strength of endothelial attachment was determined by the percentage of the original inoculum remaining after the seeded graft surfaces were subjected to a physiologic shear stress of 15 dynes/cm2 during in vitro perfusion. In polyester elastomer grafts, fibronectin did not significantly increase initial attachment but did increase the percentage of inoculum remaining after perfusion (92.1% vs. 39.74%, p = 0.001). A similar relationship existed between fibronectin-coated e-PTFE and immediately seeded e-PTFE preparations with 61.6% and 25.8%, respectively, of the inoculum remaining after perfusion (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the percentage of inoculum retained on fibronectin-coated polyester elastomer was significantly greater than on fibronectin-coated e-PTFE (p = 0.001). In comparing uncoated grafts, polyester elastomer had 39.7% of the inoculum retained after perfusion whereas only 1.8% was remaining on the e-PTFE grafts (p = 0.0001). We conclude that polyester elastomer permits better endothelial cell attachment than e-PTFE and that fibronectin coating enhances the strength of attachment to both graft materials.",

    "abstract": "The lack of a rapid, noninvasive, and accurate method to confirm or rule out prosthetic graft infection continues to constitute a compelling and vexing clinical problem. A host of adjunctive diagnostic techniques has been used in the past, but early promising results subsequently have usually not yielded acceptable sensitivity (reflecting false negatives) and specificity (reflecting false positive) data. White blood cell (WBC) indium 111 scanning has recently been added to this list. The utility and accuracy of 111In WBC scans were assessed by retrospective review of WBC scan results in 70 patients undergoing evaluation for possible prosthetic graft infection over a 7-year period. Operative and autopsy data (mean follow-up, 18 months for survivors with negative scans) were used to confirm the 22 positive, 45 negative, and three equivocal WBC scans. The false positive rate (+/- 70% confidence limits) was 36% +/- 6% (n = 8) among the 22 patients with positive scans (44% +/- 6% [11 of 25] if the three equivocal scans are included as false positive), yielding a specificity of 85% +/- 5% and an overall accuracy rate of 88% +/- 4% (80% +/- 5% and 84% +/- 5%, respectively, if the three equivocal cases are considered as false positive). All three patients with equivocal scans ultimately were judged not to have prosthetic graft infection. As implied by the high accuracy rate, the sensitivity of the test was absolute (100% [14 of 14]); there were no false negative results. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Vascular anastomoses are usually performed with nonabsorbable synthetic suture material. In an infected wound suture material may have a negative effect on the healing of vascular anastomoses, leading to leakage and formation of false aneurysms. In a canine model 40 neck wounds and 40 groin wounds were contaminated with a standard suspension of Staphylococcus aureus. Subsequently 80 end-to-end anastomoses were performed in both carotid and femoral arteries with the absorbable polydioxanone (PDS) or the nonabsorbable polypropylene (PPL) suture material in one of either side. After wound infection or hemorrhage occurred, or at least 7 days to 6 months after vascular surgery, the dogs were put to death and the contaminated vessels were removed to determine the extent of infection with light and scanning electron microscopy. Macroscopic (presence of pus, anastomotic rupture, or aneurysm) and microscopic findings (absorption, tissue reaction) were compared statistically with the McNemar test. There was no difference in the incidence of wound infection between the sutures examined. Bacteriologic cultures revealed no other microorganism than the inoculated staphylococcus strain or occasional skin contaminants. In the PPL group hemorrhages occurred more frequently (n = 6) than in the PDS group (n = 2; p = 0.125). Anastomotic aneurysms (n = 5) were found only in the PPL group (p = 0.375). These differences, although statistically not significant (because of the small number of the studied anastomoses), suggest the use of monofilament absorbable suture material for autogenous anastomoses in a contaminated area.",

We present the results of t-PA infusions in 18 patients with thrombosed peripheral arteries (12 patients) and peripheral bypass grafts (six patients). The duration of occlusion ranged from 1 to 21 days (mean, 6.8 days). Infusions of t-PA were done by way of an intra-arterial approach at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/hr. All patients demonstrated thrombus lysis angiographically. Fifteen of 18 (83%) had clinical as well as angiographic improvement. Secondary procedures to maintain patency of the arterial segment were required in seven patients. No complications occurred that were related to the t-PA infusion. No significant prolongation of the prothrombin, thrombin, or activated partial thromboplastin times occurred. At the end of t-PA infusion, the mean circulating fibrinogen level was 59% of the starting value. The therapeutic use of t-PA is still in its preliminary stages and the efficacy and safety of this promising agent need to be further established. From our early experience with t-PA, it appears to be safe as well as effective.",

    "abstract": "Although endothelial cell seeding has been demonstrated to be effective in producing uniform endothelial coverage on prosthetic grafts, no one has demonstrated that the seeded cells are the genetic precursors of the endothelial cells that ultimately line the graft. This study was performed to determine whether seeded endothelial cells were the source of the neoendothelial surface on Dacron vascular grafts implanted in the pig. Eight pairs of littermate male and female pigs were selected at birth and allowed to grow until their weight reached 20 to 25 kg. Endothelial cells were enzymatically harvested from the jugular vein of the female siblings and seeded onto 8 mm diameter grafts, 25 cm in length. The grafts were then implanted as a thoracoabdominal bypass into the male siblings. Seven other randomly selected pigs of similar size (four males and three females) had thoracoabdominal bypass with similar grafts, which were preclotted with autologous blood only, but not seeded. After 4 weeks, grafts in both groups were covered with a neointima that was more than 90% thrombus-free. The graft surface cells were grown in culture and were documented to be endothelium. Chromosome analysis demonstrated that the surface cells on the seeded grafts were from the male host and did not originate from the donor female cells. We conclude that seeded endothelial cells are not the source for the neointima on Dacron grafts in the porcine model. In addition, we have again documented that spontaneous endothelial coverage of grafts does occur without endothelial seeding.",

    "abstract": "From May 1964 to June 1983, 36 carotid-subclavian bypasses were done in 36 patients who had symptomatic lesions at the origin of the common carotid and/or subclavian arteries at the Center for Health Sciences of the University of California, Los Angeles. Ages ranged from 28 to 82 years (mean, 58 years). Eighteen bypasses were done with prosthetic grafts, 13 done with autogenous vein, and five were transpositions with primary anastomosis of the subclavian and carotid arteries. Follow-up was available on all patients and ranged from 9 to 156 months (mean, 51.5 months). The graft patency rate at 5 years determined by actuarial methods and documented by clinical examination, noninvasive evaluation, and/or arteriography was 94.1% for prosthetic grafts and 58.3% for vein grafts (p less than 0.01). The 5-year cerebrovascular accident (CVA) rate for patients with carotid-subclavian bypass done with prosthetic grafts was 6% in contrast to 39% for those with vein grafts (p less than 0.0545). All reconstructions done by transposition and primary anastomosis remain patent and there have been no late CVAs. We conclude that prosthetic grafts are the arterial substitute of choice in carotid-subclavian bypass. Transposition and primary anastomosis between the carotid and subclavian artery, when technically feasible, may be preferable to the use of free grafts in carotid-subclavian reconstruction.",

The 10-year cumulative patency (CP) rate was 56% and the limb salvage (LS) rate was 83% following graft replacement, but late results were superior in patients who received vein bypass (CP, 94%; LS, 98%), in those who underwent revascularization before ischemic complications had occurred (CP, 92%; LS, 96%), and in those who recovered both pedal pulses (CP, 64%; LS, 96%). Long-term asymptomatic limbs were restored in 96%, 92%, and 89% of these subsets, respectively, compared with 65% of those receiving other graft materials (p = 0.00003), 59% of those with preoperative ischemic symptoms (p = 0.00001) and 68% of those regaining only an isolated popliteal pulse (p = 0.0326).

All patients had excellent resolution of the ischemia and salvage of the extremity. Half of the procedures were done at the bedside with the remainder performed in the operating room. No long-term infections or ischemic sequelae resulted from the procedures in the nine patients available for long-term follow-up. The use of femorofemoral bypass grafting is, therefore, recommended in patients with severe ipsilateral limb ischemia who are dependent on an intra-aortic balloon pump to prevent extremity tissue loss as well as the systemic metabolic manifestations of ongoing tissue ischemia and necrosis.

    "abstract": "The impact of routine intraoperative carotid angiography was evaluated by comparing 206 procedures without such angiograms with our last consecutive 100 endarterectomies with completion angiography. No significant age or sex differences were observed between the two groups. Exploratory surgery was repeated in five cases for a stenosis greater than 40% or for an intimal flap. This protocol reduced operative mortality (2.9% to 1%), the permanent stroke rate (1.9% to 1%), and the temporary stroke rate (6.3% to 1%). Furthermore, a second angiogram was performed in these 100 cases (at a mean interval of 19.2 months later) and the incidence and evolution of both residual and recurrent carotid lesions were analyzed. Five internal carotid artery lesions that had been immediately repaired because of intraoperative angiographic defects remained normal. Of 58 normal internal carotid arteries at the completion of surgery, two became stenotic during the next year. In addition, three spastic internal carotid arteries became normal. Of 20 internal carotid arteries with modest irregularities, 16 became normal and four were stenosed. Of three internal carotid arteries with intimal flaps, two became normal and one was stenosed. Among 13 internal carotid arteries with modest stenosis (40%), eight became normal, two became severely stenotic, and three became thrombosed. Among 21 instances of a proximal common carotid artery \"shelf,\" 17 resolved and four progressed to less than 50% stenosis. Of 67 normal external carotid arteries, late stenosis was seen in one case. Of 33 external carotid arteries with residual stenosis, 17 became normal, 14 remained unchanged, and two were thrombosed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study examines host defense mechanisms in vascular surgery patients when admitted to the hospital to determine the frequency of abnormal host defense and the predictability of this information for septic-related mortality in affected patients. Sixty-four patients undergoing elective surgery (indications: 35 with aneurysms, 27 with aortoiliac disease, and two with renovascular disease) and nine patients undergoing emergency operation (indications: two with ruptured aneurysms, seven with aortoenteric fistulas) were skin tested when admitted to the hospital with five ubiquitous antigens (Candida, mumps, tuberculin, Trichophyton, and streptokinase-streptodornase [Varidase]) and read at 24 and 48 hours. Patients were anergic with none, relatively anergic with one, or reactive with two or more antigen responses (induration 5 mm). Eighty-nine percent of elective surgery patients were reactive, 5% were relatively anergic, and 6% were anergic. This compared with 64% reactive, 13% relatively anergic, and 17% anergic patients in a separate concurrent study of 565 surgical patients with gastrointestinal malignancies (p less than 0.001, chi 2). There were two septic-related deaths in the elective surgery group and both patients were anergic at admission, which resulted in a mortality rate of 50%. Two deaths not related to sepsis occurred in two reactive patients (4%). Logistic regression analysis predicted 3.9 deaths in the elective surgery group and four deaths were observed. Both patients with ruptured aneurysms were unreactive and both died of septic-related complications. Only one of seven patients admitted with an infected graft was reactive. All had surgery. Using the admission data of these seven patients, we predicted 2.3 deaths. Two deaths were observed 21 and 48 days after operation. Both patients were anergic and scored high probabilities of mortality (more than 0.6) at admission. The remaining emergency procedure patients scored lower probabilities of mortality (less than 0.4) at admission and none died.2+.",

    "abstract": "Although graduated internal dilatation has proved to be an effective, safe, and durable operation for the treatment of symptomatic patients with fibromuscular dysplasia of the extracranial internal carotid artery, the role of surgical treatment in this entity remains unclear because the natural history is not well defined. Forty-nine patients, aged 29 to 82 years (mean, 58.5 years), with angiographically proven fibromuscular dysplasia of 88 internal carotid arteries have been evaluated since 1969. Twenty patients showed symptoms of focal cerebral or retinal ischemia, 10 patients had nonlateralizing neurologic symptoms, three patients sustained intracerebral hemorrhage, five patients complained of nonischemic symptoms, and 11 patients were asymptomatic. The three patients with intracranial hemorrhage and one person who suffered a massive stroke after angiography died within weeks of admission; no surgical therapy was performed. Initial management of the other patients included four internal carotid endarterectomies in four patients for associated atherosclerosis, one with simultaneous graduated internal dilatation; seven graduated internal dilatations in five patients; and one extracranial-to-intracranial bypass in a patient with occlusion occurring after graduated internal dilatation. Seventy-three nondilated arteries in 42 patients have been followed for up to 16 years (mean, 6.8 years). During this time only three patients have undergone surgical therapy; one carotid endarterectomy was done for an asymptomatic atherosclerotic lesion and two graduated internal dilatations in patients with nonfocal ischemia. Through follow-up of all 49 patients, none has had a new neurologic deficit. Fourteen patients who initially presented with focal ischemia were not treated surgically and all but one are now asymptomatic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "During the past 4 years we have performed 239 reversed vein bypasses for leg ischemia in 196 patients including 45 to the above-knee popliteal artery, 118 to the below-knee popliteal artery, and 76 to infrapopliteal arteries. The cumulative primary patency results by the life-table method through 24 months are 97% at 6 months, 91% at 1 year, and 88% at 2 years. No difference was evident in patency rates with respect to site of distal anastomosis or reason for graft performance (i.e., for claudication [31%] or for limb salvage [69%]). Twenty-two percent of these patients did not have an intact ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. By a variety of techniques including the use of cephalic and lesser saphenous veins, vein splicing, and proximal superficial femoral endarterectomy, we have been able to perform autogenous vein bypass in 94% of all patients who require lower extremity revascularization. The patency of bypasses made from conduits other than greater saphenous vein does not differ from that of the entire series. Both the graft patency and vein utilization rates in the present report are equal to those of recently published series of in situ saphenous vein bypasses and are clearly better than the published results with reversed vein bypass a decade and more ago. We conclude that, although in situ saphenous vein bypass is a good procedure, it is not superior to reversed vein bypass performed in the same time period. This report again emphasizes the hazards of evaluating any new treatment by use of historic controls.",

    "abstract": "Laser angioplasty has been limited by the lack of precise control of thermal and acoustic vascular injury. Pulsed excimer lasers, by contrast, have a capacity to affect target tissue without heat dispersion or damage to surrounding structures. The ablative properties of three excimer wavelengths, krypton fluoride (249 nm), xenon chloride (308 nm), and xenon fluoride (351 nm), were investigated with the use of fresh human cadaveric normal and atherosclerotic femoral arteries. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated clean cuts with histologically normal edges. There was no evidence of either thermal or acoustic damage with any of the wavelengths studied. The depth of ablation varied directly with the number of pulses and inversely with tissue density while the incision width remained constant. The excimer laser appears to offer significant advantages over its conventional counterparts for the ablation of atherosclerotic plaque.",

    "abstract": "To define surgical anatomy, a prospective study of the greater saphenous venous system in 385 instances in 331 patients was carried out with the use of prebypass phlebography (either pre- or intraoperative). The phlebographic interpretations were confirmed during the operative procedures and from the completion angiogram. These details were recorded and analyzed by a specific computer program. These data consisted of a number of superficial branches, perforators, the identification of valve leaflets, sinuses, and the size and position of the main venous trunk both in the thigh and in the calf. The study showed that a single trunk was present in the thigh in 65% of patients and in the calf in 45%. The remainder were variants of double systems. In two thirds of patients who had complete double systems, the larger system was used for in situ bypass but the rest required the use of parts of both systems. Phlebography was accurate in the depiction of the anatomic variations (93%), double systems, cross connections, and perforator branches (87%). However, the number of competent valves could not be accurately determined (accuracy, 68%). The diameter of the vein was frequently underestimated (in 80% by 1.1 +/- 0.4 mm) and hence could not be used as an index of vein adequacy. After phlebography, four patients had transient rises in serum creatinine levels and one had an iatrogenic thrombosis of a distal segment. This study suggests that the precise anatomy of the greater saphenous venous system should be determined preoperatively by phlebography since this information is valuable for proper surgical planning before vein is used as a graft or for in situ bypass in the lower extremity.",

    "abstract": "Despite the proven experimental success of endothelial cell seeding of prosthetic vascular grafts, the process has not been widely accepted for clinical use because of its complexity and the need for a relatively large length of autologous vein to provide the requisite number of cells. Using autologous endothelial cells radiolabeled with indium 111-oxine, we studied the effect of fibronectin coating of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in a canine carotid interposition model on initial endothelial cell adherence and subsequent cell retention for up to 72 hours following restoration of blood flow. Since the number of harvested endothelial cells varied widely depending on the diameter and length of available vein, cellular adherence was best expressed as a percentage of the original cell harvest. More than twice as many (46.7% vs. 19.8%) endothelial cells initially adhered to fibronectin-coated grafts compared with uncoated control grafts. Fibronectin did not appear to influence the loss of cells within the first 30 minutes following restoration of blood flow. However, over the next 24 hours, it clearly reduced the mean cell loss from 3.7%/hr to 2.2%/hr and resulted in a sixfold increase (21.3% vs. 3.4%) in the number of retained cells at the end of a 24-hour period. When the endothelial cell preclot was performed with a solution of culture medium 199, as opposed to heparinized whole blood, there was no significant difference in endothelial cell retention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Management of dissections of the descending thoracic aorta remains controversial, especially with regard to timing and method of repair. To clarify these and other issues we have reviewed our total experience with repair of descending aortic dissections between 1962 and 1983. The 44 men and 20 women had a mean (+/- SEM) age of 59 +/- 2 years (range, 19 to 83 years), and in all patients the dissection originated in and was limited to the aorta distal to the left carotid artery (Stanford type B, DeBakey types IIIa and IIIb). Twenty-nine patients underwent operation within 2 weeks of the onset of symptoms (acute), and the remainder had later repair (chronic). During repair, circulation distal to the aortic cross-clamp was supported with cardiopulmonary bypass or shunt in two thirds of patients. Overall, 18 deaths occurred less than or equal to 30 days postoperatively (operative risk 28%), and risk was higher in acute (45%) than in chronic (14%) dissections. Operative risk was not significantly related to protection of the distal circulation. The most serious postoperative complication was spinal cord ischemia manifested by paraplegia in five patients (8%) and transient or permanent paraparesis in six patients (9%). Risk of spinal cord ischemia was significantly lower in patients who had protection of the distal circulation during operative repair (8% vs. 44%, p = 0.003). Late survival, including hospital deaths, was 49% +/- 7% at 5 years after operation; 22 of the 46 patients who survived repair were found to have aneurysms involving the thoracic and/or abdominal segments of the aorta. Our results indicate that repair of chronic dissection of the thoracic aorta has a lower operative risk than repair of acute dissections, and initial medical management of acute dissection may be indicated if no early complications occur. Risk of spinal cord ischemia is significantly reduced by cardiopulmonary bypass or shunt and is preferred over aortic cross-clamping alone. Finally, these patients require careful long-term follow-up because of the high incidence of residual or recurrent aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between intramyocardial pH during global ischemic arrest and subsequent functional and biochemical recovery, 40 canine hearts were subjected to 4 hours of arrest at 10 degrees C. Four groups, each containing 10 hearts, were differentiated by the oxygen concentration of a hyperkalemic crystalloid cardioplegic solution (CCS), which was infused every 20 minutes. In group 1 the CCS was equilibrated at 4 degrees C with nitrogen to remove oxygen. In group 2 the CCS was aerated at 4 degrees C. In group 3 the CCS was treated to achieve an oxygen tension (PO2) similar to group 2 but with a reduced nitrogen content to prevent bubble formation, which is theoretically possible during reperfusion (\"myocardial bends\"). In group 4 the CCS was fully oxygenated at 4 degrees C. The resulting PO2 of CCS measured at 10 degrees C was less than 20, 170, 170, and 750 mm Hg in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Left ventricular function (LVF) was assessed from function curves at constant mean aortic pressure and heart rate. Functional recovery, expressed as a percentage of prearrest LVF, was 38.1% +/- 10.7% in group 1 and 84.0% +/- 8.1% in group 4 (p less than 0.008). Functional recovery was 64.9% +/- 5.5% and 69.1% +/- 7.0% in groups 2 and 3, which had similar PO2. Differences in recovery between groups 2 and 3 and group 1 approached statistical significance (p less than 0.05, NS). The mean-integrated intramyocardial pH during arrest was higher (p less than 0.003) in group 4 (7.14 +/- 0.05) than in group 1 (6.84 +/- 0.06) or group 2 (6.86 +/- 0.07). The minimum intramyocardial pH during arrest was higher in group 4 than in any other group (p less than 0.002). Myocardial adenosine triphosphate concentration at the end of arrest, expressed as a percentage of its prearrest value, was highest in group 4 (75.9% +/- 8.1%) and lowest in group 1 (54.3% +/- 5.7%), a difference approaching statistical significance (p less than 0.05, NS). These data suggest that the measurement of intramyocardial pH is a useful on-line indicator of the adequacy of preservation during hypothermic arrest and that excess nitrogen in aerated CCS had little or no effect on recovery. The data confirm the hypothesis that oxygenation of CCS is associated with good myocardial preservation, which may be attributed to the provision of oxygen for the support of aerobic metabolism during arrest.",

    "abstract": "During a 16-year period at the Massachusetts General Hospital 77 patients underwent 79 procedures (29 hepatorenal bypasses, 50 splenorenal arterial anastomoses) for treatment of renovascular hypertension, renal preservation, or both. The procedure was chosen primarily to avoid a diseased or scarred aorta in 41, to allow a staged approach to bilateral renal artery stenoses or multiple vascular lesions in 17, as a \"lesser operation\" for five poor-risk patients, for complex problems including trauma, mycotic aneurysm, aortic dissection, thoracoabdominal aneurysm, and renal artery aneurysm in five, and as the procedure of choice in 11 patients. The perioperative mortality rate was 6% for the 77 patients studied. No hepatic dysfunction was seen. Deterioration of renal function occurred on three occasions but only in patients with bilateral simultaneous repair. Cure or improvement of hypertension was achieved in 52 of 63 patients and renal function preserved or improved in 67 of 77 patients. Long-term functional results remain good during follow-up periods up to 14 years. Our experience indicates that use of the hepatic or splenic artery may provide a safe and largely successful alternative for renal revascularization in selected circumstances.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate current treatment of peripheral vascular trauma, we reviewed our recent experience with noniatrogenic penetrating vascular injuries of the extremities. Between 1979 and 1984, 139 patients sustained 204 vascular injuries inflicted by single gunshots (64%), stabbings (24%), and shotguns (12%). Eighty-four percent of patients underwent preoperative arteriography, which revealed occult arterial injury in 13 patients (9%). Compartmental hypertension necessitated fasciotomy in 19% of patients and was required more often after combined arterial and venous injuries (29%) than after isolated arterial injury (14%). Arterial continuity was restored by interposition grafting with reversed saphenous vein (62%), end-to-end anastomosis (19%), vein patch angioplasty (8%), or primary repair (4%). After arterial repair, completion angiography detected the need for revision in 8% of patients. Arterial ligation was performed in 7% of injuries and was only used in the treatment of tibial and distal profunda femoris injuries. Forty-five percent of patients sustained concomitant venous injury; 64% of all venous injuries and 90% of femoropopliteal venous injuries were repaired. No deaths occurred, and a single patient required amputation. We conclude that a protocol of preoperative arteriography, liberal. use of fasciotomy, frequent use of autologous interposition grafts, repair of major venous injuries, and routine use of completion arteriography can result in limb salvage rates that approach 100% after penetrating vascular trauma to the extremities.",

    "abstract": "We report a unique case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated by both duodenal and ureteric obstruction and review the literature on these conditions. Duodenal obstruction is a consequence of compression of the duodenum in its fixed retroperitoneal course between the aneurysmal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. Treatment should be based on replacement of the aneurysm as gastrointestinal bypass alone does not resolve the risk of aneurysm rupture. Ureteric obstruction is related to encasement of the ureters in an inflammatory perianeurysmal fibrosis of unresolved etiology rather than secondary to aneurysm compression. Although urinary tract symptoms are often seen with aortic aneurysms, they tend to be nonspecific and are often overlooked. As many as 71% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms may have radiologic evidence of ureteric involvement. Although aneurysm replacement alone may resolve the perianeurysmal fibrosis with resultant relief of ureteric obstruction, most authors advise simultaneous ureterolysis. Aortic aneurysm should be considered as a possible cause of duodenal or ureteral obstruction in the elderly, especially in the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass.",

    "abstract": "Disfiguring facial edema and elevated intracranial pressure often accompany ligation and excision of the internal jugular veins (IJV) during simultaneous or staged bilateral radical neck dissection. To minimize this morbidity, unilateral reconstruction of the IJV was undertaken at the time of second-side neck dissection in 11 patients. Five patients underwent reconstruction with the spiraled saphenous vein (SVG) and in six patients 10 mm externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) was used. Prebypass jugular venous stump pressures (JVPs) were measured and ranged from 28/17 to 75/54 mm Hg with mean pressures of 17 to 62 mm Hg. Two patients had simultaneous neck dissections and nine had staged dissections. The staged interval ranged from 0.3 to 33 months. Six of nine staged reconstructions were right-sided and three of nine were left-sided. Low molecular weight dextran was started intraoperatively, regional heparinization was used in all but two cases, and platelet inhibitors were continued postoperatively in all patients. Additional time in the operating room was 45 minutes (mean). All patients have been followed up 2 to 18 months postoperatively. B-mode ultrasonography, Doppler spectrum analysis, CT scan with contrast, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess patency. Four of five SVGs and three of six e-PTFE grafts have remained functional, which resulted in an overall patency rate of 64%. Four grafts (one SVG, three e-PTFE) failed in the immediate postoperative period. All grafts in patients who had a mean JVP greater than 30 mm Hg remained patent, whereas those in patients with lower stump pressures thrombosed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to establish the influence of the recipient's thrombotic potential on the patency of small-caliber prostheses and to evaluate the subsequent improvement of graft performance by medicinally altering the prostaglandin balance in subjects predisposed to graft occlusion. Mongrel dogs were pretested and classified as low and high responders according to their thrombotic potential, measured as prostaglandin metabolite balance and platelet aggregability. High responders were randomly divided into two groups. Those assigned to serve as the medicated subjects were pretreated 1 week before surgery with a single oral daily administration of combined dazmegrel (UK-38,485) and aspirin in equal dosages of 3 mg/kg. Medication was continued throughout the experiment. Dacron grafts were implanted bilaterally in the carotid artery site in all subjects. Following a 3-week implantation period, the patency rate for the group with low thrombotic potential was 100%. In the animals with high thrombotic potential the patency rate was 10% for nonmedicated subjects and 100% for medicated subjects. These data support the concept that the thrombotic potential largely determines the capacity of the recipient's blood to thrombose small-caliber prostheses. Effective medicinal alteration of prostaglandin balance results in exceptionally increased patency of synthetic grafts.",

    "abstract": "When the saphenous vein is used in the in situ position for arterial bypass surgery, it is associated with more optimal preservation of the endothelial lining and with improved graft patency compared with reversed vein grafts. However, it is not clear whether preservation of endothelial integrity persists after arterialization. The goal of this study was to establish whether preservation of the endothelium before arterialization is a critical factor in the development of late functional and morphologic abnormalities of autogenous vein grafts. Paired reversed and in situ vein grafts were created in 75 mongrel dogs. Veins to be used in the reversed position were excised and stored in either heparinized whole blood at 37 degrees C or saline solution at 4 degrees C. Veins were studied before and after arterialization. The veins were arterialized by anastomosis to the carotid artery and excised at intervals of 1 day to 12 weeks for studies of the luminal production of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 in addition to luminal morphology. Before arterialization, normothermic whole blood preserved biochemical function of the endothelium significantly better than hypothermic saline solution, but not as well as the in situ vein procedure. Soon after arterialization, all three vein grafts showed significant functional and morphologic abnormalities consistent with injury of the vein graft. Morphologic healing of the endothelial monolayer progressed slowly back to normal; however, the biochemical capacity of the vein graft never matched that of the prearterialized vein, nor that of normal host arteries. Regardless of surgical technique, all vein grafts exhibited a period of abnormal structure and function, which exposed them to the risk of thrombogenesis. This period of potential leukocyte or platelet interaction with the vein wall could lead to release phenomena as well as proliferative changes in the vessel wall.",

    "abstract": "The effect of deferring immediate coronary artery bypass was evaluated in two groups of similar patients having successful direct coronary artery thrombolysis with streptokinase in the treatment of evolving myocardial infarction. Within 6 hours of onset of myocardial infarction, 140 patients underwent immediate cardiac catheterization and infusion of intracoronary streptokinase up to 500,000 units. Of those patients having restoration of orthograde coronary blood flow coupled with immediate evidence of myocardial salvage, 31 patients (group I) had immediate coronary artery bypass and 34 patients (group II) had coronary artery bypass deferred. Group I had no hemorrhagic, hemodynamic, or new cardiac complications. There were no deaths, reinfarction, recurrence of angina, or loss of salvaged myocardium at restudy. In group II, 11 of 34 patients had early reinfarction (p less than 0.01 vs. group I), 16 of 34 patients had recurrent angina (p less than 0.01 vs. group I) and two deaths occurred from cardiac causes. Subsequent coronary bypass was needed in 16 patients. All restudied reinfarction patients lost restored myocardium. We concluded that immediate coronary artery bypass is safe after acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery thrombolysis with streptokinase, delay of coronary artery bypass leads to an unacceptable incidence of reinfarction and recurrent severe angina, and early coronary artery bypass is needed to ensure success of thrombolysis.",

    "abstract": "CT scanning performed before and sequentially during the inhalation of stable xenon (32%), coupled with end-tidal xenon measurements, has made possible the routine construction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) maps with resolution that approximates that of the CT scanner. The capability of obtaining quantitative flow maps with direct anatomic correlation is now available with a commercial package of hardware and software adapted to the General Electric 9800 scanner. The ability to distinguish between normal and reduced rCBF in specific vascular territories has proved useful in the management of cerebrovascular disease. Specific clinical dilemmas that have been addressed with rCBF information from xenon-enhanced CT scanning include the following: In the patient with asymptomatic occlusive disease, is normal rCBF preserved? Is there adequate collateral flow? Are cerebrovascular symptoms a result of emboli or chronic regional low flow? In the patient with complex multivessel occlusive disease, which revascularization procedure is indicated first? Did operation improve rCBF? Should a further procedure be added? May a diffusely diseased but patent artery, which is the source of emboli, be sacrificed safely without compromising rCBF? On the basis of experience with 155 patients, the management and understanding of cerebrovascular disease has been aided substantially by the incorporation of rCBF mapping by xenon-enhanced CT scan in the evaluation of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Increased collagenase activity has been implicated as a basic abnormality in aortic aneurysm formation. We studied a localized aneurysmal change, poststenotic dilatation, and its relation to collagenase and elastase activity of the aortic wall. Cynomolgus monkeys underwent midthoracic aortic coarctation to produce poststenotic dilatation. Serial angiography showed that poststenotic dilatation was minimal or absent at 10 days, just discernible at 3 months, and prominent at 6 months. At the 3-month time interval, collagenase activity in the region of the poststenotic dilatation increased twofold compared with the same region in aortas from animals without poststenotic dilatation (p less than 0.05). There was no change in aortic elastase activity. These data indicate that collagenolysis and aneurysmal dilatation may be induced by local modifications of pressure and/or flow. Increased collagenase activity associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms may not represent an intrinsic metabolic defect but rather a response to altered hemodynamic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effect of seeding endothelial cells on synthetic vascular conduits has been well established. The biochemical production and interaction of the prostaglandins, prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TxA2), were studied on Dacron vascular grafts that were seeded with autogenous venous endothelial cells. Seventy-three seeded and nonseeded grafts were implanted into the carotid arteries of dogs. Animals were medicated with either cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin and dipyridamole, or ibuprofen, or U-53,059), or dipyridamole alone, or a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, U-63557A. All animals were killed at 5 weeks and analyzed for patency, thrombus-free surface (TFS), and PGI2 and TxA2 production from mid-graft punch biopsies. PGI2 and TxA2 identifications were made by radioimmunoassay determination of 6-keto PGF1 alpha and TxB2, respectively. Results of the study demonstrated in nonmedicated animals a slightly increased patency rate in seeded vs. nonseeded grafts (50% vs. 40%) and a more significant difference in TFS (49% vs. 24%). The addition of cyclooxygenase inhibitors or TxA2 synthase inhibitors significantly improved both patency (90% vs. 47%) and TFS (87% vs. 9%) in seeded vs. nonseeded grafts. PGI2 production was decreased in seeded grafts with the use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in all cases. It is concluded that seeded endothelial cells on Dacron velour grafts can synthesize PGI2; these PGI2 levels are far less than PGI2 levels produced by endothelial cells from the adjacent carotid artery; and TxA2 synthase inhibitors best improve thromboresistance of seeded grafts without significant reduction in PGI2 production.",

    "abstract": "Although femoropopliteal bypass is the accepted treatment for diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral artery, endarterectomy may be appropriate for short segmental lesions at the level of the adductor tendon. Over a 25-year period, 94 patients underwent localized endarterectomy of short (less than 15 cm) segments of the distal superficial femoral artery. There were two perioperative deaths in the series, for an operative mortality rate of 2.1%. The long-term patency rate was substantial, with 66% of the reconstructions open at 3 years and 57% open 7 years after operation. Improved results were obtained when a semiclosed method was possible with a transverse distal arteriotomy to prevent subintimal dissection. There was a trend toward improved patency in patients with claudication and those who underwent endarterectomies less than 7.5 cm in length. Patency appeared independent of popliteal outflow. Amputation was initially avoided in 82% of patients presenting with threatened limbs. These results suggest that superficial femoral endarterectomy may be a viable alternative to femoropopliteal bypass when the disease is localized to the adductor canal.",

    "abstract": "A unique peaked digital pulse contour (DPC) is frequently observed in patients with cold sensitivity, but the pathophysiology of this pulse remains obscure. To investigate the responses of the DPC to cold exposure, finger blood pressure (FBP), finger blood flow (FBF), and finger skin temperature (FST) were measured in fingers of both hands of 13 normal subjects and in 16 patients with cold sensitivity. The ratio, FBP/FBF, was used to estimate small vessel resistance (SVR). One hand was immersed sequentially in water at 40 degrees, 30 degrees, 20 degrees, and 10 degrees C, while the other hand remained in room air. DPCs were classified as normal (N), intermediate (I), intermediate-peaked (IP), peaked (P), obstructive (O), and spastic obstructive (SO). At room temperature, fingers with I, IP, O, and SO pulses had increased SVRs and decreased FSTs, and those with O and SO had decreased FBP. On cold exposure IP pulses appeared in both hands of both normal and cold-sensitive subjects, but P pulses developed only on the cooled side. IP and P pulses were associated with an increase in SVR. We concluded that IP pulses are related to reflex sympathetic arteriolar vasoconstriction, that P pulses imply vasoconstriction produced directly by cold exposure, and that O, SO, or absent pulses are indicative of digital arterial vasospasm.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic stenosis of the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery (SIPHON) may be the cause of neurologic symptoms. The frequency and severity of these lesions were studied in 226 vessels subjected to conventional two-plane carotid angiography, and the impact of sequential or tandem lesions on cerebral flow was assessed in the 167 arteries from this group that also underwent Gee oculoplethysmography (OPG-Gee), a commonly accepted indicator of the physiologic importance of internal carotid stenosis. Atherosclerotic involvement of the SIPHON was present in 46% (103/226) of the vessels studied, including six total occlusions, 11 severe stenoses (severe, 80% to 99% area reduction [AR]), 27 moderate stenoses (moderate, 50% to 79% AR), 40 mild stenoses (mild, 10% to 49% AR), and 19 instances of mural disease (MUR). This was compared with a 73% rate (166 of 226) of proximal internal carotid artery (PICA) stenosis in the neck, including six to 43 severe, 29 moderate, 50 mild, and 38 MUR. There was little correlation (r = 0.33) between the degree of angiographic stenosis in the PICA and the SIPHON. All of the totally occluded arteries had a positive OPG-Gee, whereas a positive study was noted in only 6% (7 of 109) of the arteries with less than moderate stenosis in the PICA. Twenty-one vessels had moderate stenosis of the PICA. Eight of these arteries had an associated moderate or severe lesion in the SIPHON, and seven of eight (88%) had a positive OPG-Gee. The remaining 13 of this subset had had a normal or mildly diseased SIPHON, and 12 of 13 (92%) had a normal OPG-Gee.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the hemodynamic characteristics of the normal mesenteric circulation, five parameters of the velocity waveforms were measured in 15 normal subjects in the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries (SMA) in the pre- and postprandial periods. It was noted that changes in celiac artery flow after eating was minimal, indicating that this vessel's major supply function is not to the gut. SMA parameters showing the most significant and consistent changes after a meal were the diastolic reverse flow and diastolic forward flow (DFF). Four patients referred with symptoms of intestinal angina underwent scanning and subsequent angiography of their mesenteric circulation. All four exhibited loss of reverse flow in the SMA. The change in DFF in the SMA was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Change in peak systolic velocity in the celiac artery was marginally significant (p = 0.05). Angiography revealed that three patients had greater than 90% stenosis of both vessels. The fourth patient had a 90% celiac artery and 65% SMA stenosis. The technique described offers the first noninvasive means of identifying mesenteric insufficiency. It is an effective screening method for a disease entity difficult to verify without selective arteriography. The use of velocity waveform parameters giving good discrimination between normal subjects and those with stenoses of the visceral arteries should reduce both the incidence of missed diagnosis and unnecessary angiography.",

    "abstract": "One hundred eleven impotent men and 25 potent men were prospectively evaluated with a standardized exercise treadmill test (SETT) used to noninvasively define their pelvic hemodynamics. Fifty-six men had vasculogenic impotence, whereas the remaining 55 had erectile dysfunction resulting from undetermined causes (31), psychogenic factors (10), or other identifiable reasons (14). Arteriography was performed on 40 (71%) of the patients with vasculogenic impotence without false positive results, as well as in 11 (44%) of the potent control patients and in six (11%) of the patients with nonvasculogenic impotence without false negative results, confirming the validity of the SETT. The distinction between vasculogenic and nonvasculogenic impotence can be accurately made with the SETT. Patients with vasculogenic impotence had a resting penile-brachial index (PBI) equal to 0.60 +/- 0.022 (mean +/- SEM) and a PBI after exercise equal to 0.45 +/- 0.019 with a fall in the mean PBI of -0.15 (p less than 0.001). Patients with nonvasculogenic impotence had a resting PBI equal to 0.80 +/- 0.024 and a PBI after exercise equal to 0.88 +/- 0.019 with a rise in mean PBI of 0.08 (p less than 0.001). This response was not significantly different between the control group and the nonvasculogenic impotence patients. The addition of PBI determinations after treadmill exercise revealed that 18% of the patients with vasculogenic impotence would have been incorrectly diagnosed, because their resting PBI was greater than the traditional standard of 0.70. Furthermore, 18% of the patients with nonvasculogenic impotence would have been incorrectly diagnosed as having vasculogenic impotence because their resting PBI was less than 0.70.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This prospective study was designed to measure the adaptation of collateral cerebral circulation through the circle of Willis in patients in whom a unilateral carotid stenosis of hemodynamic consequence develops asymptomatically. The collateral cerebral potential is assessed by ocular pneumoplethysmography (OPG) during proximal common carotid artery compression, measuring the collateral ophthalmic artery pressure (COAP). During an average follow-up of almost 3 years (maximum more than 7 years), 45 patients showed asymptomatic development of a unilateral hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis according to OPG evidence. In these patients the mean index COAP/brachial artery pressure did not change on the side of stenosis progression (p greater than 0.05). The developed carotid stenosis had only reduced collateral circulation to the contralateral hemisphere. The risk of inadequate collateral cerebral circulation remained during progression of asymptomatic extracranial arterial obstructive disease.",

Thirteen patients (mean age, 75 years) were selected between January 1980 and June 1984 for axillobifemoral bypass with bilateral iliac artery occlusion to manage their infrarenal aortic aneurysms (mean size, 6.3 cm; range, 4.9 to 7.5 cm). Preoperative risk factors were cardiac (angina, compensated congestive heart failure, and significant preoperative arrhythmias), 100% of patients; pulmonary (symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a 1-second forced expiratory volume less than 50% of the predicted value), 46% of patients; renal (creatinine value greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl or creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/min), 46% of patients; or nutritional (albumin less than or equal to 3.5 gm/dl or body weight less than 90% of ideal), 46%. Ninety-two percent of the patients had two risk factors whereas 46% had three or more risk factors. The operative mortality rate was 31%; three patients died of multisystem organ failure and another died of thrombin-induced consumptive coagulopathy and hemorrhage. (Our operative mortality rate for conventional graft replacement of abdominal aortic aneurysms is less than 3%.) Morbidity in persons surviving at least 1 month included thrombosis of the extra-anatomic bypass graft requiring thrombectomy (three patients), ischemic colitis (two patients), ischemic neuropathy (one patient), and patients), ischemic colitis (two patients), ischemic neuropathy (one patient), and bilateral above-knee amputations (one patient). Thrombosis of the aneurysm was not achieved in two patients despite use of fluoroscopically controlled embolization of runoff vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The destructive potential of carotid artery disease is underestimated by the clinical classification that surveys only that part of the brain with clear somatic representation. Asymptomatic patients are found to have brain infarctions on CT scan for which there is no history or symptom. To assume \"benign\" behavior of a carotid lesion, a patient must be both asymptomatic and \"asignomatic.\" Likewise, when the morbidity of carotid operations is reported, silent infarcts must somehow be taken into account. We investigated this \"silent\" disease in a prospective study of 100 carotid operations done on 91 patients over a 9-month period in our service. All patients had arch and four-vessel selective arteriography. Detailed neurologic examinations and CT scans were done before and after surgery. Of the 91 patients, 78 (86%) had a history of neurologic problems. Preoperative CT scans showed infarction in 21 patients, but only 57% of the infarctions correlated with symptoms and/or history. Among patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), 19% had an infarction seen on CT scan; however, among those patients who had lateralizing TIAs, the incidence of unsuspected infarction was higher (26%). Arteriography showed a lesion in all carotid systems supplying a symptomatic or infarcted hemisphere. Following 100 operations, four patients had neurologic abnormalities--two had transient hemianopsia and two had hemiparesis. CT scan showed a new infarct in all four patients as well as in eight other patients without neurologic findings; two of these silent postoperative infarctions were found in the hemisphere opposite the side of the operated carotid artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "With the view of assessing functional durability and the factors that influence or determine it, we reviewed the clinical course of 1748 reconstructive operations performed between Jan. 1, 1954, and Dec. 31, 1983 in the treatment of 1647 patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). Disabling intermittent claudication (in 65.6%), ischemic rest pain and/ or pregangrene (in 20.7%), and ischemic gangrene (in 13.7%) were the operative indications. Patency proven by angiography was the criterion of success. Follow-up was continuous and endless and 94% successful over a period of 30 years. Twenty-five percent of the patients were followed up for 11 to 30 years. The incidence of severe degree of occlusive involvement increased significantly from the first (9.3%) to the third (17.1%) decade of observation, whereas the perioperative mortality rate improved markedly from the first (7.4%) to the third (2.5%) decade. The aortobifemoral bypass (AF2B) procedure remained the most popular type of repair (with a perioperative patency rate of 91.4%) throughout, but both it and unilateral reconstructions lost some ground to remote (extra-anatomic) bypasses in the third decade. Atherosclerotic heart disease remained the most common cause of perioperative (50%) and late (60.2%) death. Among the early postoperative local complications graft thrombosis improved markedly from the first (8.3%) to the third (3.2%) decade. Graft infection remained rare (1.6% to 0.8%). The incidence of the most common late wound complication, anastomotic aneurysm at the common femoral level, remained relatively constant (5.7% per anastomosis), but it responded very well to surgical correction. The partial or complete secondary repair of all late complications (26.0%) improved the cumulative late patency rate in the AF2B procedures by 2% to 12% during 20 years of observation. The perioperative (97.3%), 5-year (76.6%), 10-year (76.6%), 15-year (72.5%), and 20-year (67.5%) cumulative patency rates of AF2B operations were highly satisfactory. The postoperative late survival rate of patients with AIOD declined rapidly (59% at 5, 33% at 10, 14% at 15 years). The cause of late death in 60.2% of the cases was atherosclerotic heart disease.",

    "abstract": "In the decade since April 1975 we accumulated a series of 18 patients with arterial conduits from the ascending aorta to the femoral arteries, 10 men aged 53 to 75 years (mean, 60 years) and eight women aged 33 to 56 years (mean, 50 years). In the first two patients, the conduit was placed subcutaneously; in the remaining 16 patients, it was placed behind the rectus muscle and in front of the posterior rectus fascia, thus following the ventral anastomotic axis of the internal mammary and inferior epigastric arteries. The conduit is not visible, palpable, or compressible in this position. This approach was usually chosen because of multiple failures of standard intra-abdominal and axillofemoral vascular reconstructions. Five patients had concurrent intramediastinal procedures, mostly coronary bypass or innominate artery repair. The early operations were performed with Dacron grafts with a bifurcation constructed just below the umbilicus. In the last nine patients, we have used an 8 or 10 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prosthesis and connected it to a 6 or 8 mm PTFE crossfemoral bypass. No operative deaths occurred. The 5-year patency rate by life-table analysis is 70%. This operation is an alternative to axillofemoral bypass in patients with an inoperable abdominal aortic aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Graft inclusion and vessel reattachment to openings made in the graft were employed in the treatment of 605 patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. These patients were divided into four groups on the basis of the extent of aneurysm. Group I consisted of those patients with involvement of most of the descending thoracic and upper abdominal aorta; group II involved most of the descending thoracic aorta and most or all of the abdominal aorta; group III involved the distal descending thoracic aorta and varying segments of abdominal aorta; and group IV involved most or all of the abdominal aorta including the segment from which the visceral vessels arose. The cause of aneurysm formation was medial degenerative disease in 80%, and dissection in 17%; other causes were responsible in the remaining 3%. The median age was 65 years and associated diseases including aneurysms involving other segments, atherosclerotic occlusive disease, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and renal insufficiency were frequent. The aneurysm was symptomatic in 70% of cases and rupture had occurred in 4% of cases. There were 54 (8.9%) early (30-day) deaths and 151 late deaths; 400 (66%) patients were still alive 3 months to 20 years after operation, including 60% at 5 years. Statistically significant pre- and intraoperative variables by univariate analysis that were predictive of increased risk of early death were advancing age, associated diseases that included COPD, renal artery occlusive disease, atherosclerotic heart disease, renal insufficiency, and long aortic clamp time. Three of these (age, clamp time, and the presence of COPD) retained significance by multivariate analysis. Variables predictive of risk of late death were age, dissection, extent of aneurysm, rupture, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, COPD, hypertension, and poor renal function. Age, rupture, renal dysfunction, extent of aneurysm, and dissection retained their significance by multivariate analysis. Variables predictive of neurologic disturbances of the lower extremities included rupture, reattachment of intercostal and lumbar arteries, clamp time, dissection, extent and age. Rupture, reattachment of vessels, dissection, and extent of aneurysm retained significance by multivariate analysis. Thus, the risk of this complication was greatest in patients with extensive lesions (group II) with aortic dissection. The greatest risk of renal failure after operation that required dialysis was in patients who had impaired renal function before operation. Methods employed did not prevent these complications.",

    "abstract": "The use of prostacyclin (PGI2) infusions has been recommended in the management of patients with severe distal arteriopathy, who are not candidates for conventional bypass procedures. Further clarification regarding the route of administration and the optimal dose of this potent vasodilator, however, is needed before controlled clinical trials are initiated. We measured bilateral femoral arterial blood flow electromagnetically in seven anesthetized adult mongrel dogs. Systemic arterial pressure and cardiac output were also measured. Central venous and femoral arterial injections of PGI2 were administered in five doses ranging from 10(-4) to 10(0) micrograms X kg-1 to study the dose response. PGI2 was also infused intravenously and intra-arterially for 20 minutes at a dose of 10(-1) micrograms X kg-1 X min-1. Femoral arterial injections of PGI2 in doses from 10(-4) through 10(0) micrograms X kg-1 caused significant (p less than 0.05) and dose-dependent increases in ipsilateral femoral arterial blood flow. Intravenous injections of PGI2 caused no significant changes in the dose range from 10(-4) to 10(-2) micrograms X kg-1 but resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in femoral arterial flow and systemic arterial pressure at doses of 10(-1) and 10(0) micrograms X kg-1. The femoral arterial infusion of PGI2 produced a significant and sustained increase in femoral arterial flow that was not observed during the intravenous infusion. Arterial pressure was unchanged with intra-arterial PGI2 but was significantly reduced during the intravenous infusion. The beneficial hemodynamic effects of intra-arterial PGI2 suggest that further clinical trials should employ this route of administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Plasma levels of antibiotics often do not correlate well with their tissue levels. To determine optimal antibiotic coverage for prophylactic effect in vascular surgery, we studied the tissue pharmacokinetics of four cephalosporins in dogs: cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, and moxalactam for 3 hours after a single (25 mg/kg) intravenous injection. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these antibiotics for the three most common pathogens involved in graft infections (Staphylococcus aureus, S. albus, and Escherichia coli) and their tissue concentration (TC) in the plasma, muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and aortic wall were assayed. The data are presented as TC/MIC ratio. Cefoxitin and moxalactam failed to achieve an effective therapeutic TC/MIC ratio (greater than 10) for S. aureus and S. albus in all the tissues studied whereas cefoxitin and cefamandole were above therapeutic levels. All antibiotics achieved an effective therapeutic ratio against E. coli, but cefamandole performed better (p less than 0.05) than cefoxitin; the latter reached effective levels at 3 hours. Cefamandole attained the most effective bioactive aortic tissue levels when the three most common pathogens were considered together and should therefore be considered as an antibiotic agent of choice for prophylaxis in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Using duplex sonography, we have routinely evaluated the vertebral arteries as part of the carotid artery examination in 453 consecutive patients over a 6-month period. Sixty-two of these 906 vessels could not be adequately evaluated, primarily because these vessels lay too deep within the vertebral structures, resulting in a technical failure rate of 6.8%. For the remaining 844 vessels, 74.4% were considered normal by Doppler flowmeter spectral analysis. Angiographic correlation was available for 224 vessels; of 155 judged normal by duplex sonography, 144 (93%) were shown to be normal or have only mild atherosclerotic disease. Eleven vessels were considered either occluded or to have severe disease by duplex sonography, and angiography showed this to be the case in 10 (91%) vessels. Unusually strong vertebral artery flow was associated with hemodynamically significant carotid or contralateral vertebral atherosclerotic disease or subclavian steal 82% of the time. Twelve cases of subclavian steal, only one of which was symptomatic, were identified by duplex sonography; four of these were confirmed by angiography. Angiographic correlation was available for 229 vessels in which duplex evaluation showed vertebral artery flow to be moderately damped. In 11 of these (38%), angiography showed greater than 50% stenosis. Angiography judged the remaining 18 vessels in this group normal; these vessels may represent a small subgroup of patients with normal anatomy or only mild atherosclerotic disease, but with hemodynamic dysfunction that can be identified with the duplex technique.",

    "abstract": "Pulsed Doppler ultrasonography (UA), sound spectrum analysis, and subjective interpretation of the audible signal are valuable methods for assessing carotid arterial disease; however, the relative contribution of each in making a diagnosis is disputed. To investigate this issue, 258 noninvasive carotid studies with measured x-ray comparisons were reviewed. Internal carotid spectra, UA images, and images combined with the technician's comments were each interpreted blindly by three independent readers. Percentage of stenosis was categorized into six groups: 0, 1% to 24%, 25% to 49%, 50% to 74%, 75% to 99%, and 100%. Each reader's assessment of the individual noninvasive components and his overall reading of the complete study were compared with x-ray findings and with those of the other two readers. The readings of the three observers were consistent within each diagnostic component (p less than 0.001). For each reader, the technician's comments significantly improved the accuracy of ultrasonic imaging alone (p less than 0.001). Spectrum analysis was as good as the image plus technician's comments and, for two of three readers, was better than the image alone (p less than 0.001).",

    "abstract": "With a pulsed Doppler imaging system, it is now possible to interrogate sites from the aorta to the popliteal trifurcation. To determine which velocity parameters could be correlated with the degree of disease as determined by angiography, 34 arterial stenoses identified by scanning were also evaluated by contrast arteriography and classified in 10% increments. The angiographic readings were blinded with respect to the scan results. Four hand-measured parameters from velocity waveforms obtained at the site of stenosis were correlated with the angiogram--peak systolic velocity, systolic rise time, diastolic reverse velocity, and diastolic reverse flow time. When diastolic reverse flow was absent, diastolic forward flow was recorded. To describe diastolic flow along a continuum, diastolic reverse velocity was ascribed a positive value and diastolic forward velocity was ascribed a negative value. A systolic velocity gradient (peak velocity/rise time) was also calculated. The relationship between the angiographic categories and the measured parameters was evaluated with the Jonkheere-Terpstra trend test. A trend was determined with diastolic flow (diastolic reverse flow or diastolic flow velocity) that was significant (p less than 0.01). The linear regression was calculated (y = 40.8 + [-5.6X]), and correlation coefficient was obtained (r = 0.76) that was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The method enables mapping and calculation of arterial stenoses by noninvasive means. This can be expected to obviate the need for diagnostic angiograms in certain and select cases in which angioplasty can be expected to be beneficial. It also affords a convenient quantitative means of following lesions over time.",

One hundred twenty symptomatic patients had intravenous digital arteriography (IVDSA) done as the initial diagnostic study. Twenty-five percent (30 patients) had inadequate intravenous examinations and required additional intra-arterial studies. Twenty-seven of the 30 supplemental arteriograms (90%) demonstrated clinically significant disease. The remaining 120 patients (30 asymptomatic, 90 symptomatic) had preangiographic screening with continuous-wave Doppler and spectral analysis. Forty-eight (40%) patients had hemodynamically severe lesions and 72 (60%) had moderate stenosis or arterial wall disease. IVDSA was performed when critical disease was present and intra-arterial arteriography (80% digital and 20% standard) was done when mild or moderate disease was found. The use of digital techniques on the basis of results of preangiographic noninvasive testing improved the diagnostic accuracy of IVDSA and reduced the incidence of inadequate studies to 6%. Intra-arterial digital angiography (IADSA) was advantageous in reducing costs and patient risks when IVDSA was inappropriate.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed the limb and digit hemodynamics of 67 extremities of 48 patients evaluated for blue toe syndrome in our vascular laboratory during 7 years. These patients represented 1.4% of the arterial examinations during this period. Abnormal ankle/arm pressure indices (less than 0.9), signifying proximal arterial obstruction, were present in 31 limbs (47%). Toe/ankle indices were abnormal (less than 0.6) in 57 extremities (85%), indicating pedal or digital artery obstruction. Arteriograms were obtained in 40 of 64 extremities (63%) available for follow-up, which revealed atherosclerotic disease in 90% (aortoiliac 20%, femoropopliteotibial 30%, and combined 40%), aneurysm in 7.5%, and no disease in only one extremity (2.5%). Of 64 extremities followed for 1 to 84 months (mean, 26 months), only 28 (44%) manifested an uncomplicated outcome. Tissue loss was noted in 24 (38%), recurrent digital ischemia occurred in nine (14%), and 14 limbs (22%) required amputation of toe(s) (seven), forefeet (three) or legs (four). Nine patients (20%) died in the follow-up period. Outcomes did not correlate with limb or digit hemodynamics or with therapy (surgical in 31, medical in 11, or none in 22) except that tissue necrosis was more common in patients undergoing operation. The blue toe syndrome deserves recognition as an important sign of potential limb-threatening arterial disease, but the optimal therapy remains to be established.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic imaging combined with a pulsed Doppler unit (duplex scanning) allows the noninvasive assessment of blood flow of the superior mesenteric artery. The changes in mesenteric blood flow associated with a standardized (1000 kcal) food load were measured and the results were compared with blood flow of the left common carotid artery. Twenty healthy subjects (aged 30.1 +/- 5 years) were studied fasting (12.4 +/- 2.6 hours' duration) and six times with a 15-minute interval after the test meal. The diameters of the superior mesenteric artery (0.60 +/- 0.09 mm) and of the common carotid artery (0.61 +/- 0.05 mm) were measured from the B-mode image. The Doppler frequency spectra were used to determine peak systolic, late systolic, and end-diastolic velocity and to compute the mean velocity. Although the flow parameters of the common carotid artery were virtually unaffected by food intake, a steep increase in mesenteric blood flow velocity and volume flow was observed. At rest, blood flow through the mesenteric artery was 6.3 +/- 2.6 ml/sec and 9.5 +/- 2.1 ml/sec in the carotid artery. After the test meal, mesenteric artery blood flow increased significantly (p less than 0.0001) and reached maximal hyperemia (20.3 +/- 7.4 ml/sec) after 45 minutes. The measurement of mesenteric blood flow before and after a test meal characterizes intestinal hemodynamics and should be suitable to evaluate ischemic disease and other disorders that lead to changes of mesenteric blood flow.",

We confined the analysis to the 58 patients with pure atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. In the atherosclerosis group 14 patients died and the results of hypertension control in the remaining 22 were classified as cured, three (14%); improved, 15 (68%); failed, one (5%); and unknown, three (14%). In the fibromuscular dysplasia group one patient died and results of hypertension control in the remaining 21 patients were (1) cured, 10 (48%); improved, 10 (48%); and failed, one (5%). The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 79% and 40%, respectively, for the atherosclerosis group and 95% and 89%, respectively, for the fibromuscular dysplasia group. Renal function was well maintained for patients in both groups. The mean serum creatinine value was 1.4 mg/dl in the atherosclerosis group and 1.0 mg/dl in the fibromuscular dysplasia group. To evaluate the effect of operation on the maintenance of renal blood flow we compared the blood flow of the operated and unoperated sides in patients who had a unilateral operation and had a second kidney for comparison. Eight of these patients had scans in each of the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous aspiration thromboembolectomy (PAT) is an angiographic technique that can be used to remove thromboembolic debris from the distal lower extremity circulation. This procedure employs a specially designed catheter-sheath system, which can be used alone or in combination with balloon angioplasty or thrombolytic drugs (streptokinase 10,000 U/hr or urokinase 100,000 U/hr for 6 hours) to remove thromboembolic material. PAT is best suited for treating iatrogenic emboli resulting from intra-arterial catheterization or balloon angioplasty but can be used as a supplement to Fogarty embolectomy when retained distal clot cannot be retrieved by surgical means and for removal of primary distal emboli of peripheral vascular or cardiac origin. PAT was used in 42 patients with acute threatening limb ischemia. Successful clot retrieval and limb salvage were achieved in 40 of the 42 patients (95%). The major complication was groin hematoma (7 of 42 patients, 17%) and one death occurred as a result of myocardial infarction (2.4%). PAT enhances the therapeutic role of angiography and can be used as an alternative to surgical embolectomy in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "The biochemical effects of peripheral vascular disease on skeletal muscle have not been characterized precisely because of the lack of satisfactory noninvasive analytic methods. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to measure the high-energy phosphate compounds, phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate, as well as metabolic byproducts, such as inorganic phosphates (Pi) and phosphate monoesters in calf muscles of 214 limbs with peripheral vascular disease. Intracellular pH was also measured. The NMR index (Pi[PCr + Pi]) was used to quantitate the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation as a result of ischemia. Studies done at rest documented the impairment of oxidative metabolism only in limbs with severe ischemia (ankle-brachial pressure index (API) less than 0.4). Exercise resulted in a significant elevation of the NMR index in all limbs and the rate of return of this value toward normal following exercise was prolonged even in limbs with moderate ischemia (0.4 less than or equal to API less than or equal to 0.9). Correlation of 31P NMR parameters with arteriograms showed that infrapopliteal occlusions resulted in prolonged recovery times only when the superficial femoral artery was occluded and emphasized the metabolic consequences of multisegmental disease. Accumulation of glycolytic pathway intermediates correlated with the decrease in muscle cell pH observed with exercise. Despite immediate improvement in symptoms and hemodynamic parameters following revascularization, return to normal biochemical function occurs over a prolonged period of time. This study demonstrates that 31P NMR spectroscopy can successfully measure noninvasively the important phosphorus-containing compounds involved in the bioenergetics of skeletal muscle in vivo rapidly enough to permit real-time determination during exercise and recovery.",

To determine the best approach to these patients, we screened carotid arteries in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass preoperatively with noninvasive ultrasonic duplex scanning. No correlation was noted between stroke and asymptomatic carotid disease in patients undergoing coronary revascularization. Prospective application of this finding in 2251 patients has yielded a very low incidence of perioperative stroke. We concluded that asymptomatic carotid arterial disease is not a significant risk to patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and should be managed conservatively.",

Normal coronary arteries were found in 8%; mild to moderate coronary artery disease (CAD), in 32%; advanced but compensated CAD, in 29%; severe correctable CAD, in 25%; and inoperable CAD, in 6%. Severe correctable CAD was demonstrated in 14% of patients who had no indications of CAD on clinical criteria. Patients with severe correctable CAD were advised to undergo myocardial revascularization before the vascular operation. Under this protocol, a total of 1292 cardiac and peripheral vascular reconstructions were performed with an overall mortality rate of 2.6% (5.2% for myocardial revascularization and 2% for vascular operation). Only one death (0.8%) occurred after peripheral vascular reconstruction in 130 patients who had preliminary myocardial revascularization. These results indicate that approximately 30% of all patients who require vascular reconstruction have severe, but surgically correctable, CAD and that preliminary myocardial revascularization appears to add a margin of safety to the subsequent vascular operation.",

At reoperation (repeat endarterectomy and venous patch angioplasty) the lumen was found to be reduced by 60% and histopathologic study revealed atheromatosis with organizing mural thrombus. The case is discussed in the context of the recent literature concerning restenosis, the reported frequency of which varies depending on the size of the population studied and the method of follow-up, with noninvasive studies revealing that restenosis is more commonly asymptomatic than symptomatic. Early simple fibrous restenosis differs histologically from the more complex, frankly atherosclerotic late restenosis and appears to reproduce the original pathologic condition of the carotid bifurcation; as in the original lesions hemodynamic conditions probably play a major etiologic role in the formation of the restenoses. The most important clinical factor in restenosis is continued cigarette smoking. In the majority of the studies reviewed, more than half of the patients with recurrent disease presented with symptoms referable to the site of the original operation. An argument in favor of routine vein patching during the primary procedure to attempt to prevent restenosis is presented.",

    "abstract": "Volume flow rates were measured in 31 expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (6 mm) of 26 patients undergoing hemodialysis. Flow was calculated from the known access graft diameter and by measurement of the mean Doppler shift frequency waveform. Overall flow rates were 750 +/- 383 ml/min (range, 0 to 1921 ml/min). There was no difference in flow between grafts anastomosed to either antecubital or upper arm veins but there was a significant difference in flow rate between straight and loop grafts (652 and 914 ml/min) and between grafts anastomosed to the radial, distal brachial, and proximal brachial arteries (648, 876, and 1169 ml/min, respectively). Flow rates measured during a preocclusive 14-day period in five grafts were significantly lower than flow rates in grafts that remained patent for at least 2 weeks following examination (307 +/- 172 vs. 849 +/- 346 ml/min). This is a safe, repeatable noninvasive measure of access graft hemodynamics, which may be useful as a functional monitor and a warning of impending failure.",

Before 1980 all balloons were inserted surgically through a graft and by 1983 virtually all IABPs were inserted by percutaneous techniques. Infectious complications occurred in 12.3% of IABPs inserted by the open technique and 1.5% of IABPs inserted percutaneously (p less than 0.001). Major ischemic complications were not significantly different between the two groups when all of the patients were analyzed together (p greater than 0.5) and when only the surviving patients were analyzed (p greater than 0.75). However, ischemic complications occurred in 32.9% of women in the study and only 19.7% of the men (p less than 0.005). The percutaneous insertion of the IABP is recommended as the technique of choice because of the ease of insertion, lack of infectious complications, and similar rate of major ischemic complications when compared with IABPs inserted by open surgical means through a graft anastomosed to the common femoral artery.",

    "abstract": "A study was undertaken to observe the long-term clinical behavior of the contralateral, asymptomatic carotid artery of patients after unilateral carotid endarterectomy (UCE). A consecutive series of 182 patients undergoing UCE were followed up for 1 to 9 years (mean 4.2 years). The operated artery was symptomatic in 169 cases (92.8%) whereas in 13 (7.2%) it was asymptomatic but stenotic. Follow-up included an accounting of all hemispheric or focal neurologic events in the territory of the nonoperated artery, as well as associated cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 11 patients (6%) suffered stroke (CVA) and six (3.3%) had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the distribution of the nonoperated carotid artery. By life-table analysis, major neurologic symptoms developed in 11.6% of patients within 5 years. Hypertension was an important prognostic factor: significantly more hypertensive patients had late contralateral neurologic symptoms (p less than 0.05, chi square). The cumulative incidence of CVA and TIA in these patients was 17.3% by life-table analysis at 5 years vs. 9.1% for normotensive patients. Since only a small proportion of the patients studied had a high-grade stenosis of the nonoperated artery, no conclusions could be made regarding its prognostic importance. The relevant published studies are discussed and compared with this report. Guidelines for the management and follow-up of the patient after UCE are discussed.",

The most striking feature of the lesions is an enormous accumulation of calcium that was raised more than tenfold, from a level of about 3% of dry tissue weight in the normal tissue to values approaching 50% in the pathologic specimens. The composition of the organic matrix was also altered. Elastin and glycosaminoglycan content decreased, whereas collagen content more than doubled, thus becoming the major component of the organic matrix. The cholesterol content increased severalfold above normal but even then accounted for less than 10% of the organic matrix. The lesion specimens synthesized collagen in vitro at a greater rate than normal tissue. The endarterectomy specimens with the highest calcium content exhibited the highest rate of collagen synthesis.",

The cause of aneurysm was chronic dissection in 23 patients and nondissection in 71. Most of the patients entered the study during the past 5 years and follow-up information is complete for all of them. Twenty-four percent of the patients were alive at 2 years, calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and half of the deaths were due to aneurysm rupture. In contrast, among our 604 patients treated surgically, 70% were alive at 2 years and 59% at 5 years. This study suggests that the natural course of the disease is favorably altered by surgical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Standard contrast arteriography (SCA) and intra-arterial digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) were performed during a 26-month period in 459 cases. The DSA group consisted of 22 aortoiliac studies, 66 crural-pedal arch studies, and 227 combinations. In addition, postoperative DSA was performed in 42 patients to evaluate graft patency, morphology, and inflow and runoff circulations. There were no significant differences in the quality of the preoperative aortoiliac studies performed by either SCA or DSA although, in select cases, one or the other of these techniques resulted in a superior study. Distal crural-pedal arch visualization was enhanced with DSA compared with SCA (85% vs. 65%) but when both were compared with their corresponding intraoperative completion arteriograms, the interpretive error rates resulted in comparable accuracies, false positive and negative rates, and predictive values. The likelihood of achieving graft patency in patients who have unsatisfactory preoperative visualization of the distal circulation by DSA is reasonable (11 of 27 patients) but inferior to the number obtained when there is adequate DSA visualization (40 of 53 patients). We conclude that DSA is a valuable adjunct to preoperative SCA but should not be used as the sole criterion for the assessment of operability for limb salvage. Intraoperative prereconstruction arteriography or direct surgical exploration of the crural arteries in patients with inadequate preoperative visualization will result in graft patency in a significant percentage of cases. Intra-arterial DSA for postoperative evaluation of lower limb bypass adds another dimension to analysis of graft structure and status of the host circulatory beds and also provides a method for accurate interpretation of postoperative data.",

To determine if PHZ is affected by suture technique, 16 interrupted and 21 continuous end-to-end anastomoses were studied. Pulsed ultrasound was used to obtain detailed longitudinal profiles of compliance and diameter vs. distance, at 1 mm intervals within a 2 cm region centered at the anastomoses. Both compliance and diameter at the anastomosis were lower in continuous compared with interrupted anastomoses (p less than 0.003). The PHZ was present in 86% of continuous but in only 50% of interrupted anastomoses (p less than 0.03). The site of peak compliance averaged 3.8 +/- 1.2 mm from the anastomosis and was independent of suture technique. The increase in peak compliance at the PHZ, when normalized to adjacent references values, was the same in continuous and interrupted anastomoses. PHZ augments any preexisting compliance mismatch between artery and graft, which may contribute to the development of para-anastomotic subintimal hyperplasia. Interrupted anastomoses, which create a smaller compliance mismatch than do continuous and have a lower incidence of PHZ, may be preferred in certain settings.",

During this 11-year interval, the number of patients having operation annually as well as the mean age at operation of the patients have increased significantly. The increase in the mean age from 51.9 years in 1974 to 59.4 years in 1984 occurred while the operative mortality rate fell significantly from 3.9% in 1974 to 2.0% in 1984. Although the overall incidence of major stroke was 1.8%, the stroke rate increased during this interval to 2.4% from 1982 to 1984. This higher stroke rate correlates significantly with the increasing age of the CABG patients, with the stroke risk five times greater for patients in their 70s compared with patients between 51 and 60 years old. Specific risk factors for the development of stroke during CABG in addition to age were examined and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sixty-nine percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTAs) were performed in the iliac and the femoral arteries of 54 patients. The main factors that might affect the results were reviewed: associated diseases, severity of ischemic symptoms, location and type of lesions (stenosis or occlusion and their length), and presence of disease distal to the site dilated. The vascular status of the patients in our series was more severe than in most others. Improvement at follow-up (average 15 months) was maintained in 74% of 66 radiographically successful PTAs. Poor runoff was the only factor found to affect the outcome deleteriously. Intra-arterial pressure measurements performed during the procedure and vascular laboratory studies were most valuable in assessing immediate and long-term results. Wide variations in results of PTA published in the literature are due to differences in methods of selection, evaluation, and reporting. A plea is made for future presentations of PTA series in an analyzable and comparable way, including and correlating all relevant variables as in the model suggested by the present study.",

    "abstract": "Operative treatment of nonspecific aortoarteritis remains controversial and little information is available on the results of reconstruction of extracranial cerebral vasculature in this disease. Our experience with 25 patients with histologically proven symptomatic disease treated during a 4-year period is presented. The aortic arch and its branches were involved in 12 patients and 13 had disease affecting the descending aorta and its tributaries. Patients with cerebrovascular disease had aneurysms, minor stroke, or intermittent neurologic dysfunction. Descending aortic involvement resulted either in symptomatic or ruptured aneurysm and renovascular hypertension. Operative treatment of cerebrovascular disease comprised aortic arch (three patients), carotid (three patients), or subclavian artery reconstruction (six patients). Descending aortic reconstruction comprised thoracoabdominal (four patients) or infrarenal (five patients) aneurysmorrhaphy, abdominal aortic replacement with bilateral renal artery reconstruction (two patients), and nephrectomy (two patients). One early postoperative death occurred because of stroke. Twenty-four survivors have been observed between 3 and 42 months. No deaths or further neurologic episodes have occurred during this period and three of five hypertensive patients were cured. We conclude that symptomatic aortoarteritis, including cerebrovascular disease, may be treated by standard operative techniques with rewarding results.",

    "abstract": "Several techniques have been used to revascularize the visceral circulation. Although initially successful, these repairs often have a significant rate of late occlusion. To determine the durability of transaortic endarterectomy (TEA) and antegrade aortovisceral grafting, we reviewed the last 67 consecutive patients operated on at the University of California, San Francisco for chronic visceral ischemia. The patients were principally middle-aged (mean, 59 years) women (76%) with atherosclerotic disease involving at least two major visceral arteries. Forty-seven patients underwent TEA; 22 patients had associated renal endarterectomy, and 15 patients had simultaneous aortic reconstructions. Twenty patients had an aortovisceral antegrade bypass placed as their only reconstruction. Two of these had concomitant aortic reconstructions. There were five perioperative deaths. Of the 62 patients available for follow-up, 60 patients who had a total of 111 major visceral branch repairs have been followed up for 6 months to 14 years (mean, 4.4 years). Four patients (7%) have had recurrent visceral ischemia. Two patients had recurrent symptoms and have been asymptomatic for nearly 5 and 6 years, respectively, after successful reoperations. Two patients had intestinal infarction and died as a result. Thirty-four patients have had follow-up aortography that showed 58 widely patent reconstructions, two asymptomatic single-vessel stenoses, and one asymptomatic occlusion. TEA and antegrade visceral bypass provided long-term relief of symptoms and prevented visceral gangrene in 56 of 60 patients (93%). The prolonged patency of these reconstructions is attributed to the following: They originate from undiseased or endarterectomized aorta, they provide optimal, nonturbulent flow, and they avoid the inherent technical pitfalls of retrograde grafting.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the role of carotid endarterectomy (CE) in patients 80 years and older an 8-year study of 172 nonrandomized cases of octogenarians with cerebrovascular disease was done. Ninety octogenarians underwent CE whereas 82 octogenarians, with arteriographically established carotid artery disease, were not operated on and served as a control series. The stroke rate after CE was 6%. In follow-up extending to 8 years the late stroke rate was only 2%, whereas the cumulative long-term stroke rate in the nonoperated group was 16%. These late strokes were appropriate to the side of the arteriographically demonstrated disease. In 1008 nonoctogenarians who underwent CE during this same time interval, the stroke rate after CE was 2% and the mortality rate was 0.6%. In the octogenarian population, however, the mortality rate after stroke was an alarming 40% in the operated group and 62% in the nonoperated control group. Arteriographic flow-limiting (greater than 75% stenosis) intracranial occlusive disease was identified in 53% of the octogenarians undergoing operation and in all patients who suffered a postoperative neurologic deficit. This incidence of severe intracranial disease was nearly five times that of the nonoctogenarian patients undergoing CE. Although the stroke rate after CE in the octogenarian patient was 6%, the late stroke rate was only 2% compared with the cumulative stroke rate of 16% in the nonoperated octogenarian patients. Severe intracranial occlusive disease and, therefore, flow deprivation may play a more significant role as a cause of postoperative deficits than in younger patients, but CE is appropriate for selected octogenarians on the basis of physiologic rather than chronologic age.",

    "abstract": "The mortality rate for elective abdominal aortic operations remains between 3% and 8% despite careful hemodynamic monitoring, and half of these deaths are cardiac in origin. An extensive evaluation of ventricular function was performed during abdominal aortic operation to detect subtle abnormalities in systolic or diastolic ventricular function that could precipitate progressive ischemic cardiac injury. Twenty-three patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic operations (14 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA] and nine patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease [AIOD] ) had hemodynamic and nuclear ventriculographic measurements performed preoperatively, during aortic clamping, and immediately after aortic declamping. No differences were found in the hemodynamic response to operation between patients with AAA or AIOD. Volume loading was performed at each time period to assess ventricular function. Myocardial performance (the relation between cardiac index and end-diastolic volume index) and systolic function (the relation between systolic blood pressure and end-systolic volume index) were depressed during aortic clamping (p less than 0.05), suggesting decreased contractility, but returned to baseline values after declamping. Diastolic compliance (the relation between pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and end-diastolic volume index) decreased after declamping (p less than 0.05), suggesting early myocardial ischemia. The decrease in diastolic compliance rendered pulmonary capillary wedge pressure a poor index of left ventricular preload after declamping. Higher pressures were required to maintain adequate diastolic volumes. Despite careful hemodynamic monitoring, potentially ischemic ventricular dysfunction was found during abdominal aortic operation.",

    "abstract": "Eighty-four patients with infected abdominal aortic grafts managed from 1961 through February 1985 were reviewed. Thirty-three patients had associated aortoenteric fistula formation. Twenty-eight infections (33%) and 13 aortoenteric fistulas (39%) originated at The Cleveland Clinic, yielding an incidence of aortic graft infection of 0.77% (28 of 3652 grafts) and aortoenteric fistula formation of 0.36% (13 of 3652 grafts) at this center. Staphylococcus organisms alone or in combination with other organisms were isolated from 34% of the series. Management consisted of graft removal and extra-anatomic bypass in 54 patients (64%), graft removal alone in 14 (17%) patients, partial graft removal and extra-anatomic bypass in seven (8%) patients, and miscellaneous operations in nine (11%) patients. Twenty-three patients (27%) required major amputations, nine of which were bilateral. Life-table analysis yielded 30-day and 1-year survival rates of 72% and 42%, respectively. Thirty-day survival of the aortoenteric fistula subset (49%) was less than that (86%) of the nonaortoenteric fistula subset (p = 0.003). One-year survival of patients treated since 1980 (54%) was superior to that of patients treated before 1980 (31%, p = 0.035). No difference in operative or 1-year survival was demonstrated between the group treated with extra-anatomic bypass and subsequent graft removal and another in which both procedures were performed simultaneously, although the staged group experienced substantially fewer (p = 0.04) amputations (7%) than the combined group (41%).",

    "abstract": "Recent reports in the literature have promulgated nonresective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm as a safer procedure than conventional aneurysmectomy with graft replacement in high-risk patients. This review of 106 high-risk patients who underwent conventional aneurysm repair between 1980 and 1985 was undertaken to compare the relative risks, perioperative morbidity, and operative mortality of these patients to that reported for patients treated by nonresective therapy. Excluded were those patients who had rupture initially or underwent a concomitant renovascular procedure. Patients were considered to be at high risk if they met one or more of the following criteria: age equal to or greater than 85 years; receiving oxygen at home, PO2 less than 50 torr, or forced midexpiratory flow less than 25% of predicted; serum creatinine equal to or greater than 3 mg/dl; biopsy-proven cirrhosis with ascites; retroperitoneal fibrosis; or New York Heart Association functional class III-IV angina, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%, recent congestive heart failure, complex ventricular ectopy, large left ventricular aneurysm, severe valvular disease, recurrent congestive heart failure or angina after coronary artery bypass grafting, or severe unreconstructed coronary artery disease confirmed by angiography. The mortality rate for conventional aneurysm repair in high-risk patients was 5.7%, compared with a reported 7% mortality rate for nonresective therapy. In those patients with severe cardiac dysfunction, intraoperative pharmacologic manipulation and the selective use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation appeared helpful in achieving survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Arm veins are sought as bypass grafts when the saphenous vein is absent or not usable. Duplex ultrasound provided images of the cephalic and basilic veins in 10 patients in whom visual inspection failed to reveal usable grafts. All arm veins implanted were at least 2 mm (range 2 to 6 mm) in internal diameter determined by ultrasound and were, on the average, 2 mm larger when unroofed. This noninvasive technique has decreased the number of fruitless surgical explorations to obtain a suitable arm vein and has increased the use of arm veins by revealing veins previously not anticipated by physical examination, which virtually eliminated the use of nonautogenous conduits in our practice.",

    "abstract": "A prospective, randomized trial was instituted to determine whether blood cardioplegia (BC) could reduce the morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing urgent coronary bypass for unstable angina. One hundred forty patients who came to the hospital with prolonged angina at rest and who required urgent revascularization because their symptoms were resistant to medical therapy were randomized to receive BC (n = 70) or crystalloid cardioplegia (CC) (n = 70). The operative mortality rate was 2.8%, the incidence of myocardial infarction was 8.6%, the incidence of low output syndrome was 18% and morbidity (myocardial infraction or low output syndrome) was 23%. Patients who received BC had a significantly lower mortality rate (BC, 0%; CC, 5%; p less than 0.05) and incidence of myocardial infarction (BC, 4%; CC, 13.5%; p less than 0.05) or low output syndrome (BC, 10%; CC, 19%; p less than 0.05). The highest postoperative CK-MB level was less after BC (BC, 31 +/- 17 U/L; CC, 56 +/- 13 U/L; p less than 0.05). Preoperative predictors of postoperative morbidity in addition to the type of cardioplegia included the response to medical therapy, persistent ischemic electrocardiographic changes, left ventricular ejection fraction, and age. A multivariate analysis identified the type of cardioplegic protection (p = 0.008) and age (p = 0.05) as significant independent predictors of postoperative morbidity. BC reduced the risk of urgent revascularization for unstable angina.",

    "abstract": "Fifty-four infected femoral artery false aneurysms resulting from chronic drug addiction were managed surgically with an 11% amputation rate and no mortality. Angiography localized the arterial segment involved, which in turn influenced the type of operation performed. Twenty-six aneurysms of anatomically isolated femoral artery segments were ligated and excised without resultant amputation. However, of the 28 aneurysms involving the common femoral bifurcation, 18 required triple ligation and excision that led to six amputations. Six of the 28 aneurysms were reconstructed with autogenous saphenous vein grafts, three by prosthetic grafts, and one by primary anastomosis. No amputations followed vascular reconstruction. However, all synthetic grafts eventually developed septic complications that required graft removal. On the basis of this experience we recommend ligation and excision for single artery segment aneurysms and immediate autogenous reconstruction for selected common femoral bifurcation lesions. This approach has proved safe and has reduced our amputation and graft complication rates. Extensive uncontrollable wound sepsis may contraindicate revascularization. Under these circumstances we estimate a 33% risk of amputation when the common femoral bifurcation is excised.",

    "abstract": "One of the greatest risks in peripheral vascular operations is the presence of significant coronary artery disease. To assess the proper timing and demonstrate a possible protective effect of coronary artery bypass (CAB), 1093 patients who underwent one or more peripheral vascular operations in addition to CAB from 1976 through 1984 were analyzed. During that same period, 24,441 patients underwent CAB procedures, and 8530 patients underwent major vascular operations. Carotid endarterectomy (493 patients), abdominal aneurysm resection (130 patients), renal artery bypass (12 patients), aortofemoral bypass (77 patients), femoral-popliteal-tibial bypass (190 patients), and combined vascular procedures (191 patients) were included. The patients were divided into three groups according to severity of disease, which determined timing of the procedure. Group I (255 patients) underwent simultaneous CAB and peripheral vascular operation because of unstable coronary artery disease and severe vascular disease. The early mortality rate for group I was 4% (10 patients). Seven of the 10 deaths were cardiac. In group II, 279 patients had CAB and peripheral vascular operation during the same hospital admission with the same operative mortality rate (4%, 10 patients). Six deaths were from cardiac causes, three from neurologic causes, and one from hemorrhage. In group III, 559 patients underwent CAB first, then peripheral vascular operation during a separate hospital admission. There were no cardiac-related deaths and only one neurologic-related death (operative mortality rate, 0.2%). These data demonstrate the protective effect of CAB in patients who undergo elective vascular surgery. The increased risk in patients undergoing simultaneous or same admission procedures was related to the severity of the vascular and coronary artery disease and not to the combined operations. Operative complications were not increased by performing simultaneous or same admission procedures.",

    "abstract": "These biocompatibility studies evaluate the effects of Dacron, absorbable polymeric, and compound prostheses containing both elements in various constructions on the migration, proliferation, and functional characteristics of regenerating endothelial and smooth muscle-like cells in the rabbit aorta model. Prosthesis/tissue complexes explanted after 2 weeks to 9 months were studied grossly, photographed, sectioned for light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and assayed for 6-keto-PGE1 alpha contents in inner capsular tissues. Polyglycolic acid, polyglactin 910, or polydioxanone prostheses elicited a transinterstitial migration and proliferation of primitive mesenchymal cells that differentiated into smooth muscle-like myofibroblasts and a surface repopulation of confluent endothelial-like cells paralleling the time course of macrophage-mediated prosthetic dissolution. Even small Dacron components (20%) woven into or surrounding the absorbable polymer significantly inhibited these processes, yielding significantly thinner, less cellular inner capsules with lower 6-keto-PGF1 alpha contents. These studies show the augmentation of clinically efficacious arterial regenerative activities by polymers phagocytosed by macrophages and the inhibition of these activities by Dacron.",

Unilateral (27 grafts), double unilateral (1), or axillobifemoral (72) grafts with Dacron (58), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (28), ring-supported Dacron or PTFE (12), or other material (2) were performed by 13 surgeons. Eight patients died within 30 days and three major amputations were necessary. Fifty-two (57%) of the 92 survivors had a total of 92 graft complications during a mean follow-up period of 21.5 months. Thirty-two patients underwent 57 reoperations of various types, incurring an additional three deaths and three amputations. Sixty (65%) of the original 92 survivors of AXB avoided reoperation. The 89 patients who survived the original and repeat procedures were followed up through the end of 1984 (62 patients), to late death (23), or to late graft removal (4), whichever occurred first. At these end points, 83 of the 89 (93%) patients had patent grafts. The graft patency rate of the original 100 AXBs by life table was 54% at 36 months; but with reoperation, it was 72%. Among those patients who left the hospital after AXB, the survival rate at 36 months was 69%. Statistically insignificant trends toward improved early patency were noted with bilateral femoral anastomoses, total iliac occlusion, and less severe ischemia. AXB provided safe palliation of severe arterial disease, with overall graft patency exceeding postoperative patient survival according to life-table analysis. However, the safety of AXB was tempered by frequent complications and the necessity for many reoperations to provide maximum efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Bypass grafting in the treatment of upper extremity ischemia is required far less frequently than it is in the lower extremity. The present study was undertaken to evaluate functional results and long-term patency of such grafts. Between 1978 and 1984, 33 bypass grafts were performed to relieve hand and forearm ischemia in 27 patients. The indication for bypass was neglected trauma (violent or iatrogenic) in 12 cases, primary arteriopathy in nine patients, and vascular complications of thoracic outlet compression in six patients. A reversed saphenous vein graft was used in 22 cases, and polytetrafluoroethylene was used in the remaining 11 procedures. Proximal anastomoses were from the aortic arch (one), subclavian artery (five), axillary artery (11), carotid artery (seven), and brachial artery (nine). Distal reconstructions were to the subclavian (three), axillary (three), brachial (16), radial (four), ulnar (two), and interosseous (five) arteries. Complete pre- and postoperative Doppler pressure measurements were available in 19 cases and demonstrated a significant increase in forearm systemic pressure index, from 0.51 before bypass to 0.86 postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Finger systolic pressure measurement in 10 patients also showed a significant improvement after operation. Follow-up of 31 grafts from 6 to 72 months (mean, 35.5 months) revealed an overall patency rate of 73% at 2 years and 67% at 3 years. Similar to lower extremity revascularization, more proximal grafts fared better; the 2-year patency rate was 83% for grafts at or above the brachial artery but only 53% for bypass distal to the brachial bifurcation. Major amputation was not required in any case, even after graft occlusion.",

    "abstract": "An in vitro model was developed to quantitatively measure bacterial adherence to the surface of prosthetic vascular graft material. Four strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, nonmucin-producing S. epidermidis [SP-2], mucin-producing S. epidermidis [RP-12], and Escherichia coli) were used to inoculate expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), woven Dacron, and velour knitted Dacron graft material. After graft specimens were incubated in a 10(7) suspension of bacteria, they were washed to remove nonadherent organisms and ultrasonically oscillated to dislodge adherent organisms. Quantitative culture of the sonication effluent was used to calculate bacterial adherence, expressed as the number of colony-forming units found in each square centimeter of graft material per 10(7) inoculum. All bacterial strains had a greater affinity to velour knitted Dacron graft than to ePTFE (p less than 0.025). E. coli and S. aureus adhered to velour knitted Dacron in greater numbers than to woven Dacron (p less than 0.04). The production of extracellular polysaccharide (mucin) by the RP-12 strain significantly increased adherence to both EPTFE and Dacron grafts compared with the other three bacterial strains tested (p less than 0.04). Although E. coli was less adherent to ePTFE than nonmucin-producing staphylococcal strains (S. aureus and SP-2), no difference in adherence to knitted or woven Dacron graft material was demonstrated. The differential adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts pays an important role in the pathogenesis of graft sepsis and determines relative graft infectivity. The in vitro model developed is well suited for further study of the mechanisms by which bacteria adhere to and colonize vascular grafts.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy is rapidly becoming one of the most commonly performed major surgical operations in the United States, in part because of the greater availability of noninvasive techniques to accurately diagnose extracranial carotid arterial disease and a low reported morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively reviewed the records for all carotid endarterectomies performed in the greater Cincinnati area for a recent 12-month period and examined the impact of surgical specialty and operative caseload on the results. Altogether, 750 operations were performed on 656 patients by 61 surgeons working in 16 general medical-surgical hospitals. Overall, strokes occurred in 5.1% of all patients; 2.3% of patients died. Symptomatic patients had a significantly higher risk of suffering a postoperative stroke compared with asymptomatic patients (6.5% vs. 3.7%), although the risk of death was virtually identical (2.4% vs. 2.1%). When the operating surgeons were classified into four types on the basis of their previous training, no statistically significant differences in either postoperative stroke or death could be identified. Furthermore, when the surgical caseloads of these physicians were grouped into three categories (i.e., less than 12 each year, more than 50 each year, and a group between these two extremes), no significant differences in outcome were seen. We concluded that our community-wide results for carotid endarterectomy were not comparable to those previously published from specialized centers and that these results did not appear to be influenced by the type of formal surgical specialty or operative caseload.",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic and hematologic responses to protamine sulfate reversal of heparin's anticoagulant effects were studied in 15 consecutive randomized patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery. In a double-blinded manner, patients were pretreated with either normal saline solution (n = 8) or protamine (0.75 mg/kg/3 min, n = 7) 5 minutes before heparinization (150 IU/kg). After aortic grafts were placed, protamine (1.5 mg/kg/3 min) was administered intravenously to reverse the heparin. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, and cardiac output were monitored, as were platelet count, white blood cell count, activated clotting time, total hemolytic complement levels, and C3a levels. Calculated parameters included systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance. Pretreatment with protamine compared with saline solution prevented the hypotension (+6 vs. -16 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and declining pulmonary artery pressure (+1 vs. -7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) observed with protamine reversal of heparin. Significant differences between the two groups in central venous pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were of less clinical relevance. Protamine pretreatment lessened the thrombocytopenia found during reversal compared with saline-pretreated patients although the difference was not statistically significant. Minimal hypotension occurring after protamine pretreatment alone was not accompanied by hemodynamic or hematologic changes, other than decreased heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In a previous study of arterial bypass grafts (4 mm polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) in baboons we observed that endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) formed the neointima and were derived from the cut edges of adjacent artery. The purpose of this study was to determine at late times whether endothelial cells would continue to migrate and to proliferate to cover the graft surface and whether the underlying proliferating SMCs would produce a progressively thickened intima, graft stenosis, and eventual thrombosis. At 6 and 12 months after grafts were placed, endothelial coverage by ingrowth from the anastomoses was more advanced than at 3 months, and by 12 months 60% of grafts (7 to 9 cm in length) were covered. Endothelial cells proliferated in association with the growing edge and focally in other regions. Underlying SMCs proliferated in the region of the growing edge of the endothelial cells and also at anastomoses. Intimal cross-sectional area was greatest at anastomoses and at late times was principally due to an increase in connective tissue; actual SMC mass remained constant after 3 months. These results demonstrated slow but progressive healing of the grafts by ingrowth of endothelium. There was also an increased turnover rate of SMCs and endothelial cells in established intima at late times, which might be the consequence of chronic endothelial injury. This condition represents a stable state since it does not produce further intimal thickening and accumulation of SMCs and does not lead to a high rate of thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Anterior compartmental intramuscular pressure was studied by the continuous-infusion technique during and after arterial reconstruction of the abdominal or lower extremity vessels in 23 patients. Although there were significant differences between the mean pressures in those patients who had proximal or distal arterial reconstruction, the mean pressure did not increase in the sequential preocclusion, occlusion, and postoperative periods during a mean follow-up of 26 hours in proximal reconstructions and 19 hours in distal reconstructions. One patient had pressures consistent with a borderline compartmental syndrome but died of a ruptured left ventricle before complete correlation of the clinical course and pressures could be made. We conclude from this study that although routine measurement of compartmental pressures during arterial reconstruction of the lower extremities yields interesting findings, it makes no important contribution to the clinical management of the patient.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of preoperative renal failure on the outcome of patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Of 251 patients undergoing AAA repair from 1977 to 1984, 10% had evidence of preoperative chronic renal failure. These patients were classified according to their preoperative serum creatinine values; group I had preoperative creatinine levels of 2 to 4 mg/dl, group II had creatinine levels greater than 4 mg/dl but no history of hemodialysis, and group III consisted of patients on chronic hemodialysis before operation. One of 16 patients in group I developed transient high-output renal failure postoperatively. Four of the six patients in group II (67%) developed significant postoperative deterioration of renal function and required acute hemodialysis. Of the four patients in group III maintained on chronic hemodialysis preoperatively, one died of sepsis from an ischemic colon. This experience suggests that patients with mild renal dysfunction (serum creatine value less than 4 mg/dl) can undergo elective AAA repair without additional morbidity. Patients on hemodialysis before operation can also safely undergo surgical repair of their AAAs electively if dialyzed the day before operation. Patients with severe renal dysfunction (serum creatinine greater than 4 mg/dl) who are not on hemodialysis should be considered for dialysis preoperatively in an attempt to reduce the high incidence of serious postoperative renal functional deterioration and subsequent morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell seeding of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) arteriovenous prostheses was performed to compare seeding with homologous vs. autologous cells and to study the effect of homologous seeding with a larger vs. a smaller number of cells. Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to four equal groups: I, control; II, light homologous seeded; III, heavy homologous seeded; and IV, autologous seeded. Bilateral femoral arteriovenous loop grafts were inserted in all. Efficiency of seeding was assessed by cell counts of instilled vs. retained cells. All grafts remained patent and were harvested approximately 8 weeks after implantation. Samples were evaluated grossly by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. There was a direct correlation between number of cells instilled and number retained for each graft; group III received and retained the largest number (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively). The amount of thrombus deposition on the lumen of all grafts was grossly the same. Endothelium was demonstrated in samples obtained from the midgraft of groups III and IV; in contrast no endothelium was seen in groups I and II. The percentage of endothelialized surface was not determined. No immunologic cellular reaction was detected in any of the samples. We conclude that in the animal laboratory it is possible to seed e-PTFE arteriovenous prostheses successfully with homologous cells and to improve the efficiency of seeding by implanting a larger number of cells obtained from an endothelial cell bank. The potential applications of this technique to the clinical field are discussed herein.",

Plaques were separated into three groups: those from patients with lateralizing symptoms, nonlateralizing symptoms, and no symptoms. All the plaques were inspected microscopically for evidence of hemorrhage, specifically, repeated hemorrhages. Repeated hemorrhages were found in 29 of 44 plaques (66%) in the lateralizing symptom group, 6 of 19 (32%) in the nonlateralizing symptom group, and 12 of 32 (37%) in the no symptom group.

There were no instances of hematoma, graft infection, aneurysm formation, suture line disruption, or embolic events distal to the puncture site. One local thrombus developed within a vascular graft that was corrected by a simple thrombectomy performed with a surgical catheter. One puncture site required 2 hours of compression to maintain hemostasis.

Improper completion of the process may result in four anatomic anomalies: duplication of the inferior vena cava, transposition or left-sided inferior vena cava, retroaortic left renal vein, and circumaortic left renal vein. The first two anomalies can be diagnosed by sonography and all four anomalies can be seen on CT scan of the abdomen. Duplication and transposition of the inferior vena cava should be further delineated by preoperative phlebography. Preoperative diagnosis of the anomalies should reduce the complication rate of abdominal aortic operations.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a technique to render knitted Dacron prostheses totally impervious to blood leak by impregnating the cloth with collagen. These grafts were prepared by the manufacturer, sterilized, and have an indefinite shelf life. The objective of this study was to determine whether collagen impregnation has a deleterious effect on surface thrombogenicity and graft healing. The infrarenal aortas of 30 mongrel dogs were replaced with 6 cm X 6 mm Dacron grafts (15 collagen-impregnated and 15 control). The collagen-impregnated prostheses were visibly indistinguishable from the control. After blood flow was restored, no interstitial bleeding occurred in the collagen grafts, in contrast to the control grafts that initially leaked profusely. When they recovered, the dogs were divided into three groups: group I (five collagen, five control), group II (five collagen, four control), and group III (five collagen, three control). The grafts were harvested at 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively. Retroperitoneal healing response, capsular thickness and adherence, completeness of neointimal healing, surface fibrinolytic activator activity, and sections taken for light and scanning electron microscopy were studied and compared in a blinded fashion. In a separate set of experiments, experimental and control grafts were compared for in vivo surface thrombogenicity. The healing data were identical in the experimental and control prostheses in all parameters. Of particular interest was that initial capsule adherence was better and surface thrombogenicity less in the collagen-impregnated prosthesis. We conclude that collagen impregnation of a knitted Dacron prosthesis has no deleterious effect for the term of observation of this experiment.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in medical treatment, an acute aortic dissection is still now often fatal because of the seriousness of its condition. The currently available therapies include blocking the progress of dissection with intensive drug therapy, a process leading to the chronic stage. However, the dissection often proceeds rapidly and may result in death. Various surgical procedures have been attempted so far, but they produce highly invasive stress and high risks. Accordingly, we designed a cylinder-type balloon catheter and developed a new closing procedure, wherein a balloon catheter is introduced and inflated at the site with an intimal tear to maintain the blood flow to the distal vessels and also to close the entry. With this procedure, the complaints will be relieved or disappear, the progress of the dissection can be stopped, and the blood flow can be restored to the reduced and collapsed true lumen. When the blood in the pseudolumen becomes coagulated and organized, the balloon is removed. If this catheter is introduced from the femoral artery (similar to an intra-aortic balloon pumping method), the invasive stress will be further reduced. This method appears to be the most useful for DeBakey type III dissections. We are now intensively studying the safe and effective application of this balloon catheter under various clinical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Common carotid artery (CCA) blood flow was measured noninvasively with a pulsed Doppler duplex scanner modeled after the Octoson (Ultrasonics, Inc., No. Yonkers, N.Y.). The aim of the study was to determine normal values and to assess the accuracy of CCA flow as a predictor of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. One hundred one people who did not have disease were studied; the overall mean flow rate was 395 +/- 79 ml/min (mean +/- S.D.). There was no significant correlation with age, height, or body surface area but there was with body weight (p less than 0.05). A statistically significant difference was evident between men (424 +/- 88 ml/min) and women (371 +/- 62 ml/min) (p less than 0.001). The intrasessional variation (S.D./mean) was 13% and the intersessional variation, 16%. No significant difference was seen between the sides. Ninety-two patients who had carotid angiography were studied and the flow rates compared with the degree of ICA stenosis on each side. The flow rate for mild ICA stenosis (1% to 39%) was 404 +/- 109 ml/min, for moderate stenoses (40% to 69%), 390 +/- 91 ml/min, and for severe stenoses (70% to 99%), 351 +/- 109 ml/min. There was a significant difference in flows only between mild and severe grades of stenosis of the ICA (p less than 0.01). With unilateral stenosis, comparison of flow values in the normal and affected sides showed the greatest discriminatory power when the absolute difference of flow values was taken (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative balloon angioplasty was performed on 80 patients undergoing a concomitant vascular reconstructive procedure during the past 30 months. All angioplasties were performed by the operating surgeon with the aid of fluoroscopy and in conjunction with the vascular reconstruction. The primary purpose of balloon angioplasty was to either increase inflow (66%) or outflow (23%) in association with a planned vascular procedure. The remaining patients had a variety of other arterial dilatations. Dilatation obviated the need for additional arterial reconstructions in these elderly patients. One episode of peripheral embolization constituted the only operative complication. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 30 months (mean, 13.4 months). Sixty-four patients remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period. Sixteen patients became symptomatic in the postoperative period and underwent angiography. One iliac and three superficial femoral arteries had restenosed. The remaining 12 patients had additional vascular problems not associated with the dilatation or previous operation. The intraoperative use of the balloon catheter by the vascular surgeon broadens the therapeutic armamentarium available for the correction of multiple, symptomatic, arterial lesions. Balloon angioplasty as a separate procedure was thus avoided, resulting in decreased morbidity and expense. The scope of arterial reconstructions was expanded without expansion of the operation. The balloon catheter should be used intraoperatively as adjunctive therapy in appropriate circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Polypropylene suture has steadily gained popularity for use in vascular and cardiac surgical procedures because of its long-term tensile strength and minimal tissue trauma. However, recently some questions have arisen concerning its safety. We recently had two cases of polypropylene fracture, one occurring early and the other late after operation. Comparison and collation of these two cases with other reports leads to the conclusion that polypropylene suture is safe in most situations, but care must be taken to avoid instrumentation trauma and kinking stresses at knots, which probably explain most of the reported cases of polypropylene failure. In addition, polypropylene probably should not be used in graft-to-graft anastomoses in which the continual sawing stresses of two rigid structures appears to lead to an excessive incidence of late suture fracture with resultant false aneurysm formation.",

    "abstract": "Reports in the vascular surgery literature are often difficult to assess and compare with each other because of poorly defined terms, imprecise categorization, lack of indices for gauging the severity of the disease or the presence of risk factors capable of affecting outcome, and varying criteria for success or failure--in essence, a lack of standardized reporting practices. The joint councils of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery have appointed an ad hoc committee to deal with this problem. This report represents the recommendations of the first of its several subcommittees, that is, the one dealing with reports on lower extremity ischemia. Certain terms are defined and criteria offered for uniformly gauging the severity of disease, the findings of diagnostic studies, the types of therapeutic interventions, and the outcome of such treatments. Although future modifications may further improve on this effort, it is hoped that this committee's recommendations will help establish reporting standards for articles dealing with lower extremity ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Cafergot is a combination of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine and may cause symptoms of peripheral vascular insufficiency. Iatrogenic ergotism should be suspected in any patient exhibiting ischemic symptoms while receiving this medication. Progression to fulminant necrosis and gangrene can occur. Two cases are presented and the management reviewed. This effect of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine may be an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction with therapeutic doses or may result from excessive medication. Iatrogenic ergotism occurs most often in women in their mid-thirties with migraine syndrome. By alpha-adrenergic agonism, as well as by possible interactions with prostaglandins, calcium, and serotonin, ergotamine causes vasoconstriction of both arteries and veins. The angiographic pattern of spasm, collateral formation, and intravascular thrombi is typical. Treatment of ergotism depends on the severity of the symptoms and the possibility of gangrene. Discontinuation of ergotamine, cigarette smoking, and caffeine may be all that is necessary in most patients. Nitroprusside is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute vascular insufficiency from ergotism, but in a less urgent situation, prazosin has also been effective. Intra-arterial balloon dilatation has also been helpful. Other forms of therapy have been supportive and the results inconsistent. Cafergot should be used with extreme caution in patients with renal or hepatic failure, peripheral vascular disease, or pregnancy. Relative contraindications include hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and Raynaud's phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "During the past 2 years, streptokinase has been used to treat subclavian or axillary vein thrombosis in seven patients of whom two were considered \"effort\" thromboses and five resulted from use of a central venous catheter. All patients had venography performed before treatment to document the thrombosis, and venography was repeated after streptokinase therapy to determine the status of clot dissolution. Streptokinase was given either systemically or in a lowered dose locally, with low-dose therapy chosen whenever a catheter could be threaded up to the clot through an antecubital vein. Although all seven patients had resolution of their clinical symptoms, only one had complete dissolution of the thrombus. The failure of streptokinase to completely dissolve the thrombus suggests that, although apparent clinical improvement can be achieved after streptokinase infusion, treatment of the underlying cause, whenever possible, may be necessary if complete resolution of the thrombus is to occur.",

    "abstract": "Seventy-one cases of iatrogenic arterial injury requiring repair at our institution from 1972 through 1984 were retrospectively analyzed. Cardiac catheterization accounted for most of the injuries (62%). Ten injuries (14%) resulted from angiography or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; four injuries (5.6%) occurred after invasive monitoring devices were inserted. Six injuries (8.45%) stemmed from complications of intra-aortic balloon pump insertion, whereas the remainder occurred during various surgical procedures. Most injuries were in the femoral (42.3%) and brachial (38.1%) locations. Thrombectomy (23.9%) and resection with end-to-end anastomosis (35.2%) were the repairs most commonly performed. Morbidity and mortality were low; only one case resulted in limb loss, and neither of the two deaths resulted from the vascular repair itself. On the basis of our experience, we can make certain recommendations with regard to specific injuries. First, the conservative approach to brachial artery thrombosis occurring after catheterization is early exploration and repair. Second, although most injuries can be managed simply with thrombectomy and primary repair, iliofemoral injuries are more likely to require complex reconstructive techniques. Third, large-bore catheter injuries to the carotid artery require immediate exploration and repair to prevent thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, and cerebral embolism. Fourth, symptoms of nerve compression after transaxillary arteriography require prompt exploration. Our results indicate that, depending on the site of injury, individualized techniques of varying complexity are required for repair. In general, serious sequelae can be minimized by early recognition, prompt operation, and adherence to sound vascular surgical principles.",

Blood was obtained without application of a venous tourniquet. The results are expressed as the amount of fibrin lysed per unit of time and are not affected by the fibrinogen concentration, a drawback inherent in previous techniques. The mean value (+/- standard deviation) of fibrinolytic activity was 0.464 +/- 0.158 mg of fibrin lysed per hour in the control subjects and 0.194 +/- 0.089 mg of fibrin lysed per hour in the patients. This difference is significant (p less than 0.01) and indicates a considerable reduction in fibrinolytic activity in patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis. This has been demonstrated without the need to stimulate the release of plasminogen activator by applying a venous tourniquet as done in previous studies.",

Two limbs were found to be \"normal.\" Nine limbs were hemodynamically obstructed; the remaining 18 limbs had developed reflux abnormality. All of the nine limbs with obstruction demonstrated symptoms of severe swelling or ulceration. In contrast, limbs with valve reflux were either asymptomatic or had only mild to moderately severe symptoms. Correspondingly, the reflux hemodynamic derangement was also mild, with reflux confined to a single level (commonly the popliteal valve). The implications of the differences in clinical presentation and hemodynamic profile between this group with post-thrombotic valve reflux and the typical patient with stasis caused by chronic venous insufficiency are explored. The natural history of stasis sequelae of deep venous thrombosis has apparently changed somewhat since the introduction of anticoagulation therapy.",

    "abstract": "A decrease in the formation of prostacyclin (PGI2), a potent vasodilating and platelet antiaggregatory substance, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy. This defect, as well as others, may contribute to imbalances in the thrombo-regulatory system resulting in enhanced platelet aggregability, accelerated atherosclerosis, and subsequent vessel injury. Until recently the major thrust of relevant literature has been directed toward abnormalities in PGI2 quantity or function in vascular tissue from experimentally induced diabetic animal models. For the past 2 years our laboratory has studied prostaglandin metabolism in human diabetic and nondiabetic blood vessels. We determined prostacyclin synthetase (PGI2ase) activity in saphenous veins of diabetic and nondiabetic patients (HSV-D and HSV-ND) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts and in tibial arteries and tibial veins of diabetic patients (HTA-D and HTV-D) and nondiabetic patients (HTA-ND and HTV-ND) undergoing limb amputation for arterial disease of the lower extremity. Carbon 14-labeled prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH2) was incubated for 2 minutes with vascular microsomal protein. The products were separated via thin-layer chromatography and quantified by radiochromatographic scan. PGI2ase activity was determined by the formation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, the stable breakdown product of PGI2. Results of this study indicate that the microsomal fractions of all vascular tissues studied contain an active PGI2ase capable of forming PGI2; formation is enzymatic, as the amount of product increased with increasing microsomal protein concentration; there is no significant difference in PGI2ase activity between HSV-D and HSV-ND; PGI2ase activity in HTA-D and HTV-D is less than in HSV-D and HSV-ND.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Seven hundred thirty-one percutaneous transluminal dilatations (TLDs) for peripheral arterial occlusive disease were performed between 1978 and 1984. From this prospective study 666 dilatations were analyzed with a combination of clinical and objective vascular laboratory tests to determine which factors could be used to predict long-term successful results. Eleven variables were recorded at the time of TLD. The proportional hazards model (Cox regression) identified four significant variables predictive of long-term success: the indication for the procedure (claudication or salvage), site of the dilatation (aortoiliac or femoropopliteal), runoff (poor or good), and whether a previous TLD was done at the same site. With these significant variables, the Cox model was used to estimate the chances of success at 1, 2, and 3 years for all combinations of variables. The accuracy of the Cox model was confirmed by the close approximation between the number of observed and predicted successful TLDs at 1, 2, and 3 years. We concluded that the chances of success of TLD in terms of percentage at 1, 2, and 3 years can be predicted from the combinations of these four significant variables. Knowledge of these factors should permit better selection of patients for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "The risk of infection in vascular prosthetic conduits appears to be greatest in the perioperative period and the organism most frequently found is Staphylococcus aureus. Previous work suggests that antibiotics must be chemically bonded to the material to resist rapid washout caused by the flow of blood through the graft. The exception to this is rifampin, which remains fixed in Dacron prostheses after passive addition of the agent to aliquots of blood used to clot the interstices of porous Dacron grafts. This characteristic of rifampin is presumed to be caused by its poor water solubility. This potential infection resistance was challenged in a standard model of a canine infrarenal aortic graft by intravenous infusion of S. aureus organisms (10(7)) in the perioperative period. The grafts of five animals were preclotted with 9 ml of autogenous blood plus 1 ml of rifampin (60 mg/ml). A second group had similar procedures with 1 ml of cefazolin (238 mg/ml) substituted for the rifampin, and a control group had 1 ml of saline solution added to the 9 ml aliquot of blood. The animals were killed at 3 weeks and examined for clinically apparent infection. Rings of the graft material were also removed aseptically and cultured. All five grafts preclotted with cefazolin had clinical and culture evidence of infection (S. aureus), as did the grafts of three of the five control dogs. None of the grafts preclotted with rifampin was infected (p less than 0.05). Addition of rifampin to the blood used to clot the graft interstices appears to be a simple way of imparting graft resistance to perioperative sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Eight currently used arterial prostheses with differing constructions and materials were implanted in the descending thoracic aorta of mongrel dogs. The prostheses were Gore-Tex (polytetrafluoroethylene), DeBakey Woven, Cooley Woven, Meadox Woven Double Velour, Cooley Knitted Double Velour, Microvel, Vasculour II, and Bionit II. Five series of these eight prostheses were serially implanted in heparinized subjects. During the 40 implantations, attention was focused on three major characteristics: preclotting efficiency, surgical handling characteristics, and healing. Gore-Tex is impervious to blood. The DeBakey and Cooley woven grafts are nearly so. The remaining prostheses required preclotting. The Meadox Woven Double Velour became impervious after two preclotting steps, the Cooley Knitted Double Velour and the Bionit II required three, and the Vasculour II and the Microvel required four. The surgical handling characteristics of the knitted prostheses clearly surpassed those of the DeBakey and Cooley woven and Gore-Tex prostheses. Although the Meadox Woven Double Velour prosthesis had better conformability than the nonveloured woven, the tendency of its cut edge to fray was more pronounced. Healing was much more advanced in the knitted and woven prostheses than in the Gore-Tex.",

    "abstract": "One of the stated advantages of the in situ bypass is that twists or torsion along the vein are automatically prevented by the technique. Unfortunately, this is not strictly true because the distal mobilized end of the vein, which is being anastomosed to the outflow tract, is quite prone to twists of 180 to 360 degrees after its arterialization. This torsion may result in either immediate cessation of flow or later formation of an anastomotic stenosis. We describe a technique that, when used, should eliminate all such problems.",

A thoracic aortogram was obtained to exclude mediastinal vascular injury, and an incomplete intimal disruption of the proximal left vertebral artery was found. Transient visual disturbances developed after admission, and the patient was treated by operation and vein patch angioplasty. He recovered without additional neurologic symptoms.

This report describes a patient with an Aspergillus valvular endocarditis on a native valve with embolization to the right axillary, left iliac, and left popliteal arteries and the distal aorta. Diagnosis was made from a thromboembolectomy specimen. Treatment consisted of removal of the peripheral arterial emboli, mitral valve replacement, and prolonged intravenous infusion of high-dose amphotericin B. The patient presently has the longest survival period of any patient with an Aspergillus infection on a native heart valve.

This is usually a perioperative coagulopathy, which may progress into a hemorrhagic diathesis. Rarely, DIC is present preoperatively as a result of the aneurysm itself. In the presence of additional pathophysiologic factors, a \"compensated state\" of secondary fibrinolysis may deteriorate into a clinically manifest coagulopathy. Heparin can be a useful adjunct in preoperative management of DIC, but definitive treatment requires surgical repair of the aneurysm. Long-term follow-up is essential to ensure that DIC is due to the aneurysm and that other disease processes are not overlooked. We report a case of DIC caused by an abdominal aortic aneurysm, with resolution after surgical treatment.",

The patients receiving 5% dextrose Ringer's lactate maintained higher arterial PO2 at 40% forced inspiratory oxygen (PaO2, 83 +/- 3 torr vs. PaO2, 67 +/- 5 torr, p less than 0.05). Optimal fluid management was approached by the use of 5% dextrose Ringer's lactate solution postoperatively.

To determine a method to verify patency, 57 lymphovenous anastomoses were performed in 34 dogs. In vivo cinelymphangiography gave convincing evidence of patency up to 8 months. Eight of 10 anastomoses were patent at 24 hours, 8 of 19 at 2 to 6 weeks, 4 of 6 at 3 months, and 2 of 6 at 8 months. Antiplatelet treatment did not decrease the thrombotic occlusion rate on the venous side, which was the main cause of failure. Scanning electron microscopy showed complete endothelial coverage of suture lines at 4 weeks. Because this study demonstrated that patency of lymphovenous anastomoses can be achieved, the procedure may be considered for the treatment of secondary lymphedema. The occlusion rate is high; therefore, chances of success are better with several anastomoses performed in the early stages of lymphedema, before significant tissue fibrosis and complete loss of lymphatic valvular function develop.",

    "abstract": "The Brescia fistula is the method of choice for providing vascular access in patients who have chronic kidney failure that requires hemodialysis. This study investigated hand hemodynamics in patients with Brescia fistulas to determine the incidence of radial steal and its relationship to symptoms of arterial insufficiency of the hand. Twenty-three patients, one of whom had symptoms of arterial insufficiency, were studied. Thumb systolic blood pressure was determined by photoplethysmography under resting conditions and with the fistula, radial, and ulnar arteries occluded successively by digital pressure. The brachial pressure was determined by Doppler ultrasonography and the thumb/arm pressure ratio was determined for each experimental condition. The presence of a Brescia fistula resulted in a 40% reduction of the thumb blood pressure (median thumb/arm ratio = 0.61), which returned to normal (median ratio = 1.03) when the fistula was occluded. Occlusion of the radial artery distal to the fistula resulted in a significant increase in thumb blood pressure (median ratio = 0.89; p less than 0.001), indicating the presence of radial steal. This phenomenon occurred in 21 of the 24 fistulas (88%) studied. This study demonstrated that the radial steal phenomenon occurs in most patients with Brescia fistulas but in only a small number of these patients do symptoms of arterial insufficiency develop.",

    "abstract": "Objective documentation of the quantitative physiologic changes associated with the repair of carotid lesions of hemodynamic consequence was obtained in 701 procedures by a comparison of pre- and postoperative ocular pneumoplethysmographic tests (OPG-Gee). The results of repair of severe stenoses depended on the status of the carotid artery opposite the repaired vessel. If the vessel opposite the carotid artery repaired was functionally patent, severely stenosed, or totally occluded, the ocular blood flow improvement on the side of repair was 16%, 27%, and 47%, respectively. Only in the latter group was improvement in ocular blood flow observed on the side opposite the carotid repair (13%). Ocular blood flow, the bulk of which (choroid) is not autoregulated, is a much more sensitive indicator of carotid lesions of hemodynamic consequence than is the autoregulated cerebral blood flow. OPG-Gee is presented as a simple noninvasive test that reliably and reproducibly assesses the quantitative physiologic changes associated with the repair of carotid lesions of hemodynamic consequence. The latter represent 84% of all carotid endarterectomies at this institution.",

In North America 10% to 17% of the adult population is affected, an incidence 10 times that of arterial disease. Despite this, origin and mechanism of disease remain obscure. This study was designed to illustrate the presence of patent arteriovenous shunts in the varicosed limb and to assess their role. Twenty-eight women and twenty-one men with primary varicose veins were studied. Thirty-six men and seven women without venous disease served as a control group. Blood samples were collected from an arm vein and a limb varicosity in the study group along with an arterial blood sample. Blood samples were also drawn from an arm vein and the femoral vein in the control group along with an arterial blood sample. Venous partial oxygen pressure (PVO2) and hemoglobin saturation (HbSat) were measured and venous oxygen content (CVO2) calculated. Mean values were then obtained and statistical comparisons made between each group. A statistically significant increase (p less than 0.001) in all three parameters--PVO2, HbSat, and CVO2--was demonstrated in the patients' limbs with varicose veins, consistent with a functioning arteriovenous shunt.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy fails to ameliorate nonhemispheric cerebral symptoms in an unacceptably high proportion of patients, specifically those patients with minor, hemodynamically insignificant carotid lesions. Ocular pneumoplethysmography (OPG) has been shown to accurately predict the hemodynamic significance of carotid lesions, but its use has not been applied to the subset of patients with nonhemispheric symptoms. Preoperative OPG studies were obtained in 43 patients with nonhemispheric symptoms. Postoperatively, 72% of patients with OPG suggestive of hemodynamically significant carotid lesions were relieved of symptoms. By contrast, only 32% of patients with normal OPG were asymptomatic after carotid surgery (p less than 0.05, life-table methods, 24-month follow-up). These data suggest that OPG is a useful test to determine which patients with nonhemispheric cerebral symptoms will benefit from carotid revascularization.",

    "abstract": "In many patients with peripheral vascular disease, conventional arteriograms are not adequate to make proper preoperative decisions. In the past, these inadequate studies led to surgical exploration of vessels and intraoperative angiography to determine operability. Such efforts prolonged operating time and potentially had adverse effects on amputation levels. Recently, intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IDSA) has provided an excellent means to further evaluate these patients preoperatively. We presently have 30 patients in whom IDSA supplemented routine aortography and runoff studies. When standard angiographic studies were considered inadequate, the catheter was positioned appropriately and IDSA was obtained. Inadequate lower extremity distal runoff in 23 patients and no proximal or distal runoff in seven patients prompted the IDSA. The IDSA study yielded further information on all patients, and 26 of 30 patients underwent successful bypass operation. In all 17 patients having femoropopliteal or femorotibial bypass, the IDSA was confirmed by an intraoperative (after bypass) angiogram. Nine patients had inflow procedures, and operative findings corroborated the IDSA. Two patients refused surgery and two patients were not candidates for revascularization. The IDSA study provided an accurate \"road map,\" eliminated unnecessary vessel exploration, saved vital operative time, and prevented compromise of potential amputation levels.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study compared intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) with conventional catheter angiography (CA) performed on 105 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. Comparisons were made considering CA as the \"gold standard.\" Factors reviewed for correlation included carotid artery stenosis, ulceration, fibromuscular disease, vessel occlusion, and subclavian and intracranial lesions. Each IV-DSA was judged as to its quality. Eighty-seven patients (83%) had interpretable IV-DSA studies. IV-DSA differed from CA regarding stenosis on 46 carotid arteries (26%). Of 47 excellent quality IV-DSA studies, 18 (38%) were in disagreement with CA regarding stenosis. For the subcategory of patients having hemodynamically significant stenosis (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) according to CA, the sensitivity of IV-DSA was 85%. Specificity was 94% with an overall accuracy rate of 92%. The authors believe these high values are somewhat misleading. The IV-DSA interpretation of stenosis differed from CA in 32 of 48 patients (67%) in this group with a mean difference of 30%. IV-DSA identified 3 of 11 intracranial lesions (27%). Surgical therapy was modified in 13 of 87 patients (15%) on the basis of angiographic interpretation of carotid artery stenosis compared with IV-DSA. We conclude that IV-DSA should be used as a screening tool and the decision for carotid artery surgery made solely on its findings should be reached with the knowledge of its limitations and that any patient with hemispheric cerebral symptoms warrants CA as the first diagnostic examination.",

Nitroglycerin at 1 microgram/kg/min redistributed hind limb blood flow; hind limb arteriovenous shunting increased from 5.6% +/- 4.0% to 17.8% +/- 7.4% after 30 minutes (p less than 0.01); absolute hind limb shunt flow increased from 12 +/- 10 ml/min to 31 +/- 26 ml/min at 10 minutes (p less than 0.01); whereas hind limb nutrient blood flow decreased from 184 +/- 81 ml/min to 150 +/- 55 ml/min and 132 +/- 32 ml/min, respectively, at 10 and 30 minutes (p less than 0.05). Such hind limb blood flow redistribution was absent during infusion of all other nitroglycerin dosages. Total catecholamines increased at 30 minutes during both 1 and 10 micrograms/kg/min nitroglycerin infusions (p less than 0.05) with perhaps a slightly greater catecholamine response to 10 micrograms/kg/min after 30 minutes (0.05 less than p less than 0.10). The renin-angiotensin response at 3 minutes differed between nitroglycerin infusions of 1 and 10 micrograms/kg/min with an initial significant reduction from baseline in plasma renin activity at the lower dose compared with a significant increase from baseline in plasma activity at the higher dose. Nitroglycerin did not increase femoral artery flow or cardiac output and did not lower total peripheral vascular resistance at any dose studied. Despite this, arterial pressure and cardiac work were reduced at all nitroglycerin doses tested. Massive volume loading prevented the anticipated blood pressure reduction and blunted the expected cardiac work reduction during nitroglycerin infusions of 10 micrograms/kg/min. This study demonstrates that nitroglycerin is not a potent peripheral arteriolar vasodilator, 1 microgram/kg/min nitroglycerin infusions increase hind limb arteriovenous shunting and decrease hind limb nutrient blood flow, and myocardial work and arterial pressure reductions during nitroglycerin infusions appear to be caused by mechanisms other than generalized peripheral arterial dilation.",

    "abstract": "Dacron fabrics with a wide range of porosities were autoclaved for 3 minutes after being soaked in serum, 5% albumin, or 25% albumin. Porosity of compound Dacron grafts made with 25% albumin was less than 1 ml/min/cm2 regardless of the fabric base, whereas porosity of grafts made with serum or 5% albumin was proportional to the porosity of the base fabric. Porosity of the compound grafts remained stable for more than 48 hours and to pressure greater than 450 mm Hg, if the grafts were kept moist. Tubes of Marlex mesh coated with heat-denatured albumin, implanted as infrarenal aortic replacements in dogs, showed complete albumin absorption by 3 weeks. However, perigraft tissue reaction and graft incorporation were minimal and extensive false aneurysm formation resulted. Knitted filamentous Dacron 6 mm tubes coated with heat-denatured albumin were implanted as iliofemoral bypass grafts in 12 dogs, with blood-preclotted knitted filamentous Dacron grafts implanted as contralateral control grafts. Comparison of the albumin-coated grafts with the blood-preclotted control grafts showed no differences in healing or patency at 4 to 6 months. Heat-denatured 25% albumin forms a strong and hemostatic coating regardless of fabric base. Albumin-Dacron compound grafts are easily and rapidly made in the operating room, handle well, and are suitable for large and medium-sized arterial replacements without changes in healing or patency. Because of slow tissue incorporation, however, albumin-coated knitted Dacron grafts should be avoided in patients who require long-term anticoagulation therapy.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of our findings that the outcome of reconstructive surgery for lower limbs could well be predicted by flow waveform analysis, we reviewed femoropopliteal arterial bypass operations involving the use of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts for 35 patients. Of 38 grafts, 26 were PTFE alone, and 12 were PTFE/vein composite grafts. Neither ankle pressure index nor angiographic distal runoff was of predictive value as a prognostic indicator. The cumulative patency rate, calculated by the life-table method, revealed the usefulness of flow waveform analysis for prediction of the outcome of PTFE grafts. In type 0 or I flow, the patency rate was 94% at 1 and 2 years and 79% at 3 years. In contrast, in type II flow, the patency rate was 74% at 1 year, 66% at 2 years, and 49% at 3 years, with a statistical significance at 2 and 3 years (p less than 0.05). Comparison of the result of PTFE grafts with that of PTFE/vein composite grafts showed superior results of composite grafts at 3 years after implantation (42% vs. 83%, p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that flow waveform analysis is useful for prediction of the outcome of PTFE grafts and that PTFE/vein composite grafts should probably be used, particularly in cases of abnormal blood flow.",

    "abstract": "Eighty-nine patients with clinical problems arising from the thoracic or abdominal aorta had computed tomography (CT) scans with contrast enhancement in addition to standard aortograms. Forty-four patients had aneurysms, 22 had aortic graft complications, and 23 had aortoiliac occlusion. CT scanning provided diagnostic information not apparent by conventional angiography in 39 patients (43.8%). This additional information did not significantly alter the operative management in 13 patients (14.6%). The helpful information provided by CT in these patients included demonstration of gallstones, renal cysts, anomalous venous structures, horseshoe kidney, and femoral anastomotic aneurysms. However, in 26 of 89 patients (29%), the additional data obtained by CT significantly changed the timing or approach to operative management. Management was altered in 12 of 44 patients (28%) with aneurysms, 7 of 22 patients (32%) with aortic graft complications, and 7 of 23 patients (30%) with aortoiliac occlusive disease or suspected distal thromboembolism. Specific information provided by CT included contained aortic aneurysm rupture, aortic dissection, laminated intraluminal thrombus or pseudointima, extent of perigraft infection, aortic atherosclerosis, anastomotic false aneurysm, and thrombus as a source of distal embolization. Thus, CT had a significant impact on operative management. It serves as a valuable adjunct to aortography in patients with complex aortic problems.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous intra-arterial infusion of fibrinolytic agents has emerged as an alternative to embolectomy in selected patients with acute arterial occlusions. The combination of fibrinolytic therapy and embolectomy may be superior to either modality alone. This experiment was designed to determine safety and efficacy of intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy as an adjunct to catheter embolectomy. Forty hind limbs in 20 adult mongrel dogs were embolized with thrombus created in vitro. After 24 hours, bilateral transfemoral embolectomy was followed by intra-arterial, intraoperative infusion. Fifteen limbs (control) received 250 ml of saline solution during a 30-minute period; 25 limbs (experimental) received an arterial infusion of 60,000 units of streptokinase during a 30-minute period (SK 30'). In five limbs of each group, 500 units of heparin (H) was added. In five experimental limbs the streptokinase infusion time was increased to 60 minutes (SK 60'). Arteriograms and blood flow measurements were obtained before and after embolectomy (PE) and after infusion (PI); the results were compared. Improvement between the PE and PI angiograms was seen in 20% (3 of 15 dogs) of control subjects. In contrast, improvement after the infusion was evident in 100% (5 of 5 dogs) of dogs given SK plus H 30' (p less than 0.01), in 80% (12 of 15 dogs) of dogs given SK 30' (p less than 0.01), and in 20% (1 of 5 dogs) of dogs given SK 60'. A trend toward increased blood flow was noted in the experimental group. There were no intraoperative complications with hemostasis or postoperative bleeding (36-hour observation). We conclude that intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy in dogs is safe and effective as an adjunct to thromboembolectomy. A human clinical trial is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative angiography has become an essential adjunct to reconstructive vascular surgery. Therefore, radiation exposure and its potential risks to the performing surgeon need to be known. To study this, we designed experimental and clinical tests quantifying the radiation exposure to the surgeon during different intraoperative angiograms. Radiation exposure to various parts of the surgeon's body was quantified by thermoluminescence dosimetry. During each exposure a surgeon standing one foot from the x-ray tube received an absorbed dose equivalent to 0.24 to 1.4 millirems, which is about half that of an intraoperative cholangiogram. With 5 000 millirems considered the maximum permissible dose, this would imply that an upper limit of about 3 500 intraoperative angiograms each year (68 each week) could be performed safely. Comparatively, abdominal angiography carried the most significant risk (p = 0.01) and peripheral angiography was the least hazardous. Fluoroscopy increased radiation exposure more than four times that of nonfluoroscopic procedures (p = 0.05). The surgeon's extremities received the greatest dose, followed by the eyes and neck, suggesting the need for individual monitoring devices for those parts to be worn by surgeons who perform operative angiograms more frequently than average. Our study indicates that the radiation dose received by the surgeon during operative angiography, especially that of peripheral vessels, is minimal. Operative arteriography is not only a simple and readily available diagnostic tool, but it is quite a safe procedure if applied correctly.",

Ten patients had cardiac emboli (group I) and eight had aortoiliac occlusive disease (group II). Fourteen of these patients had paresis or paralysis. Diagnosis was prompt but the time lapse from onset of symptoms to revascularization averaged 18 hours (group I, 10.3 hours; group II, 26.1 hours). All 10 patients in group I had embolectomy alone; of the eight patients in group II, two had transfemoral thrombectomy and six had bypass procedures. The perioperative mortality rate was 40% in group I and 62.5% in group II. Complications developed in 12 patients (nine died); renal failure occurred in 11, compartment syndrome in nine, adult respiratory disease syndrome in three, acute myocardial infarction in three, disseminated intravascular coagulation in two, and paraplegia in one. No amputations were required in the nine survivors and limb function was restored in eight of these patients. Acute aortic occlusion sets in motion a chain of events that threatens life and limb. Prompt diagnosis and revascularization by the simplest operation are required to decrease morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "One hundred two patients with acute lower limb ischemia were treated with intra-arterial streptokinase. Thirty-seven patients had occluded vascular grafts and sixty-five had had no previous vascular surgery. Eighty-six limbs were acutely threatened. Intra-arterial streptokinase was given as an initial loading dose with a lower maintenance dose given afterward. The mean duration of therapy was 59 hours and hematologic monitoring was meticulous. Indications for intra-arterial streptokinase therapy were contraindication to surgery, anticipation of technically difficult surgery, and multiple occlusions that required separate surgical approaches. Seventy-two legs were saved (71%) and 30 amputated. Morbidity was low and only 1 of the 11 deaths was attributable to streptokinase. No leg was lost that would otherwise have been saved by straightforward surgery and no leg was lost that had not been previously threatened. In 46 patients for whom emergency femorotibial bypass would have been necessary, 35 legs (76%) were saved. Forty-three patients had vascular reconstruction immediately after streptokinase therapy was stopped, to bypass occlusive lesions that had been demonstrated by the thrombolytic therapy in 28 patients, and because streptokinase had produced no response in 15 patients. The advantages of intra-arterial streptokinase in the management of the acutely ischemic leg are that the leg may be saved without surgery, that surgery is not precluded, that the patient can be made as fit as possible for surgery during the streptokinase infusion, and that streptokinase can facilitate surgery by delineating underlying vascular pathologic conditions and clearing distal runoff vessels.",

    "abstract": "A questionnaire was used to determine the patterns of use of noninvasive testing by vascular surgeons. The 494 respondents had been in practice an average of 18 years. Many of the examinations were done outside the office; 85% of laboratories used were hospital facilities. In the area of cerebrovascular testing the ocular pneumoplethysmographic techniques and the periorbital Doppler test continued to be used extensively; however, the acceptance of new technology was confirmed by the finding that 71% used some form of imaging. Arterial insufficiency of the legs was most commonly evaluated with segmental Doppler pressures and stress testing was used only in selected cases. Noninvasive tests were widely used postoperatively for the follow-up of patients. Most venous testing was aimed at the detection of acute deep venous thrombosis, and venous Doppler examination and impedance phlebography were the most widely used techniques. The data from this study document the patterns of use of the vascular laboratory. Unexpected findings included the widespread use of imaging (especially duplex scanning) and the frequent use of multiple tests for cerebrovascular evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Direct seeding of endothelial cells onto synthetic vascular prostheses has become the subject of increasing surgical research during the last 5 to 7 years. The currently employed cell harvest techniques are inefficient, resulting in cell counts far below the number of cells calculated to be present on the original donor vein. We have compared two methods of enzymatic endothelial cell harvest: cannulation with flushing and eversion over a stainless steel rod. Harvested cells were plated onto tissue culture plastic and counted after 24 hours of incubation. The methods ensured that only those cells viable and functional enough to adhere to the plastic were being considered. Cells were identified as endothelial by immunohistochemical techniques applying antisera to factor VIII-related antigen. Segments of normal vein and of veins treated by each technique were viewed with a scanning electron microscope. Cannulation was the superior method, providing greater numbers of viable, functional cells. The eversion technique was unreliable and probably injurious to endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the diagnostic power of penile/brachial index (PBI) in patients studied for male sexual impotence, we prospectively interviewed 503 patients referred to our vascular laboratory for PBI measurements. Since the predictive values of diagnostic tests are affected by the prevalence of the disease in the population studied, we calculated the independent likelihood ratio for various PBI levels obtained. For the purpose of this analysis, \"organic\" impotence was defined as occurring in patients who had no nocturnal erections, whereas \"clinical\" impotence was defined as occurring in those patients who could not achieve penetration during intercourse. The patients were divided into four groups by the presence or absence of risk factors, including peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and diabetes mellitus. Patients taking medications that may affect potency (n = 175) were excluded from this analysis. The results show that the predictive power of PBI is less in diabetic patients with PVD and least in those without either PVD, diabetes, or drugs. In patients with PVD but no other risk factors, PBI is highly diagnostic with a sharp cut-off point at 0.6. Thus, the diagnostic power of PBI can be improved by considering the risk factors in the patients studied.",

By 6 weeks the groups were equivalent (laser, 25.6 +/- 4.6 microns; suture, 17.3 +/- 1.2 microns; p, not significant).

    "abstract": "After discovering an aneurysm in a glutaraldehyde-tanned umbilical vein (GTUV) graft that resulted in graft thrombosis, we reevaluated all patients from our institution who had GTUV grafts implanted for more than 2 years. Of 60 patients identified, 14 of 15 patients with patent grafts were recalled and had either digital subtraction or standard angiographic studies. Angiographic changes in the grafts were graded on a scale of 0 to 3, from normal (grade 0) to frank aneurysmal degeneration (grade 3). Eight grafts (57%) had frank aneurysmal (grade 3) changes, and three other grafts (21%) had preaneurysmal (grade 2) changes. Only one graft was angiographically normal. GTUV grafts undergo aneurysmal degeneration in a significant percentage of implants. Symptomatic aneurysms have presented with thrombosis and limb-threatening ischemia as well as rupture. GTUV aneurysms should be treated by complete graft resection, as segmental resection of diseased portions of grafts resulted in metachronous aneurysm recurrence. Because of the high incidence of GTUV degeneration, the clinical indications for the use of GTUV grafts should be seriously reevaluated, and we recommend that all patients with patent GTUV grafts for more than 2 years be evaluated for the presence of aneurysmal degeneration.",

The relative effectiveness of various hemostatic agents has not previously been determined by controlled comparisons. In this study 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular prostheses were used to perform carotid-carotid and femorofemoral bypasses in eight heparinized dogs. The relative effectiveness of isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate, fibrin adhesive, and oxidized regenerated cellulose was determined by application of these hemostatic agents to three sources of bleeding: arterial-PTFE anastomoses, PTFE-PTFE anastomoses, and 18-gauge needle holes in PTFE vascular prostheses. The mean time to hemostasis (MTH) was determined for each hemostatic agent. Although application of isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate resulted in the shortest MTH in each experimental group, the reported inflammatory response that it induces and its possible carcinogenicity limits its availability for clinical use. Application of fibrin adhesive prepared from single-donor hepatitis-screened plasma resulted in a significantly shorter MTH in each experimental group when compared with oxidized regenerated cellulose. We recommend clinical use of fibrin adhesive to control needle hole and anastomotic bleeding from PTFE vascular prostheses.",

    "abstract": "An in vitro investigation is described in which the biomechanical properties of several host artery-graft combinations are characterized under realistic hemodynamic environments. Canine carotid arteries served as the host vessel and were anastomosed to one of the following graft materials: 4 mm I.D. thin-walled expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE), 6 mm I.D. thin-walled e-PTFE, modified human umbilical vein, autogenous foreleg vein, and carotid artery. A novel feature of the experimental design is the use of a pulsatile perfusion apparatus that simulates realistic normotensive or hypertensive hemodynamics, including pulse rate, perfusion pressure, and flow rate. Measurements of dynamic transmural pressure and vessel radial motion (determined with a helium-neon laser micrometer) were obtained during pulsatile perfusion. From these data calculation of the mismatch in diameter and elasticity modulus between the host carotid artery and various graft materials is made. The longitudinal propagation of the non-uniform radial displacement associated with the construction of the anastomotic junction is also calculated and presented. The present methodology is directly applicable to testing of other vascular substitutes and provides repeatable and reliable biomechanical data.",

    "abstract": "Venous valve reconstruction in 31 limbs (28 patients) with chronic deep venous insufficiency is analyzed. The indications for operation were primary or secondary deep valvular incompetence with severe reflux and venous hypertension. Valvuloplasty was performed on a proximal valve of the superficial femoral vein (SFV) in 17 limbs and on a common femoral vein valve in two limbs; transplantation of a valve-bearing segment of the axillary vein was made to the common femoral vein in two limbs, to the SFV in seven limbs, and to the popliteal vein in three limbs. The results of valvuloplasty were satisfactory, with six failures observed during a follow-up period extending to 84 months (mean, 44 months). Eight of 12 valve transplant reconstructions failed within 2 years. Patency and competence of the reconstruction were obtained in 27 limbs at the 6-month postoperative control period. The effects on venous pressure were analyzed regarding the presence or absence of reflux into the profunda femoral vein (PFV) with preoperative retrograde phlebography. The results showed significant reduction of the ambulatory venous pressure (p less than 0.05) and increase in venous recovery time (p less than 0.01) in limbs with PFV competence. In limbs in which the PFV was incompetent the pressure values remained unchanged. These findings suggest that the functional state of the PFV is of great importance to the venous hemodynamics of the limb. This study also indicates that the principle of one-level repair in the SFV seems appropriate in limbs with a competent PFV.",

A palpable abdominal mass was present in 33%. All patients eventually underwent abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy with a resultant mortality rate of 50%. Delayed diagnosis, preoperative hypotension, advanced age, poor nutritional status, and excessive intraoperative blood loss were factors contributing to this high mortality rate. In this unusual clinical presentation of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, a high index of suspicion by the emergency room staff and prompt surgical intervention are mandatory to improve mortality rates. The anatomy of the retroperitoneal space and the phylogenetic development of a channel between the scrotum and the kidney are important factors in the development of this symptom complex.",

    "abstract": "Exaggerated carotid sinus reflexes may account for alterations in consciousness responsible for significant disability and injury in elderly patients. Nonspecificity of symptoms and concomitant medical conditions frequently delay diagnosis and therapy. During a recent 9-year period, 82 patients were identified as having symptomatic carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH). Fifty-nine patients described complete syncope, 73 patients had multiple syncopal or near-syncopal episodes, and 40 patients related cervical pressure or motion as provocative events. Electrophysiologic testing demonstrated that 47% had cardioinhibitory CSH, 26% had vasodepressor CSH, and 27% had combined vasodepressor and cardioinhibitory CSH. The mean follow-up period of all patients was 36 months. Surgical therapy included ventricular demand pacemaker implantation in 33 patients and carotid sinus denervation in seven patients. Medical therapy was used in 32 patients, 11 mildly symptomatic patients were not treated, and 3 patients had carotid sinus irradiation. Pacemaker implantation relieved symptoms in 53%; however, 11 patients (33%) had significant postoperative complications. Carotid sinus denervation relieved symptoms in 86%, medical therapy in 54%, and carotid sinus irradiation in 33% of patients. Because of its demonstrated effectiveness in all variants of CSH and negligible perioperative morbidity, carotid sinus denervation should be offered to acceptable operative candidates when the diagnosis of CSH is confirmed.",

This group was characterized by the absence of significant carotid disease (12 of 13 patients) and equal arm pressures bilaterally in most patients (8 of 13 patients). An isolated supraclavicular bruit (12 of 13 patients) and a history of ipsilateral digital ischemia (5 of 13 patients) were common. Arch angiography demonstrated proximal subclavian lesions in 12 patients, with obvious ulcerations in 10 cases and thrombus in an old carotid-subclavian bypass graft in one case. Surgery directed at removal or exclusion of the lesion was successful in all cases. Isolated lesions in the subclavian artery can be a source of emboli into the vertebrobasilar circulation. These lesions are effectively treated by exclusion and vascular reconstruction.",

SAAs may appear clinically with rupture, thrombosis, distal embolization, or compression of the sciatic nerve. We have reviewed our three cases and the literature to delineate those factors that permit correct preoperative diagnosis and appropriate surgical intervention. Our three patients (aged 54 to 82 years) appeared with severe ischemia that resulted in above-knee amputations. The literature reveals 21 patients ranging in age from 35 to 84 years (58% were women). Twenty of those patients had operations, one of which resulted in death, and five in above-knee amputations. Unexplained sciatic or buttock pain, or a palpable \"pulsating\" buttock mass, suggests an SAA. The diagnosis is confirmed by angiography. The recommended treatment is femoropopliteal bypass grafting followed by ligature or percutaneous endovascular thrombosis of the aneurysm. Early diagnosis and correct surgical therapy are the keys to successful management of SAA.",

    "abstract": "During a 3-year period, 12,158 cardiac catheterizations were performed via the brachial artery. During this same period, 106 patients were operated on for complications of brachial artery injury and/or thrombosis, an incidence of 0.9%. The indication for the cardiac catheterization was coronary artery disease in almost 92% of the patients. Early (less than 4 days) brachial artery repair was done in 90% of the patients. The operative findings were thrombosis (91%), intimal injury (54%), stenosis (13%), laceration and/or perforation (11%), and atherosclerotic plaque (6%). Because of vessel injury, localized resection was done in two thirds of the patients. Vascular continuity was obtained with axial reanastomosis in 45 patients and interposition vein graft in 26 patients. Primary lateral repair was performed in 23 patients (22%). Ninety-five percent (101 patients) had initial excellent results. Of the five patients who required reoperation, flow was restored in four patients. Thus, 99% of patients had restoration of a patent brachial artery. Contributing factors for brachial artery complications are \"redo\" catheterization, prolonged catheterization time, catheter change, brachial artery atherosclerosis, improper arteriotomy closure, experience of cardiologist, female patient, and failure to use heparin. Because of the unpredictability of ischemic symptoms occurring after brachial artery thrombosis, the need for bypass graft surgery when delayed, and the good results with early surgical intervention, early exploration of brachial artery complications after cardiac catheterization and appropriate repair are recommended.",

    "abstract": "From 1976 to 1983, 682 patients have undergone aortic reconstruction at Parkland Memorial Hospital and the Veterans Administration Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Thirty-five patients (5.1%) had a biliary tract operation performed before, during, or after their aortic procedure. Fourteen percent of patients had bacteria in the bile and 11.4% needed common bile duct exploration. Twelve patients had their aortic reconstruction first. Biliary pancreatitis developed postoperatively in one patient. Two patients who had infected prostheses removed had acalculous cholecystitis after operation and one had jaundice and fever 3 years after operation, but no biliary disease was found. Twenty-one patients had the biliary procedure first. Four patients were operated on for suspected aneurysm rupture an average of 18 months after operation. There was one true rupture; this patient had no gallstones. One patient had acute aortic thrombosis 10 days after emergency operation for acute cholecystitis. Only two patients underwent combined operative procedures; both were patients with acute aortic problems in whom chronic and subacute biliary disease was found. Eight operative deaths occurred, all in the patients undergoing aortic procedures. There were no ruptured aneurysms or acute biliary problems needing emergency operation in any patient with cholelithiasis. On the basis of our experience, we believe that concomitant cholecystectomy and aortic reconstructions rarely need to be performed and then only in those patients in whom the risk of not treating both biliary and aortic conditions is greater than the operative risks. In these circumstances, cholecystostomy should be considered to decrease operative time and the risk of graft contamination.",

    "abstract": "Splanchnic arteriosclerosis is common among the elderly population, but intestinal angina is distinctly a rare entity. Extensive and efficient mesenteric collateral pathways make development of intestinal angina unlikely unless at least two major vessels exhibit hemodynamically important stenoses. Herein we describe the surgical management of 17 patients with chronic intestinal ischemia. The patients most commonly had postprandial pain and lost significant weight; angiography, including lateral aortography, confirmed the diagnosis. An average of 2.5 vessels in these 17 patients were arteriosclerotically involved. These 17 patients underwent 20 major splanchnic artery reconstructions altogether (average, 1.2 vessels per patient) for relief of symptomatic intestinal ischemia. Arterial reconstructions (16 bypass procedures and 4 endarterectomies) were undertaken with either autogenous saphenous vein (10 vessels) or Dacron prosthetics (6 vessels). Revascularizations involved the superior mesenteric artery (six patients), hepatic artery (three patients), splenic artery (seven patients), and inferior mesenteric artery (four patients). Five deaths occurred after operation, two early and three late, all from myocardial infarctions. All patients who survived have been relieved of their pain, and there has been no recurrence. The average length of follow-up has been 60.9 months and repeat angiography in six patients at intervals of up to 5 years has shown no evidence of revascularization occlusion.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate results of medical and surgical treatment of axillary-subclavian venous occlusion, the clinical courses of 95 patients were reviewed. Twenty-three patients had acute axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis, and 72 patients had chronic occlusion. Thirty-four patients with thoracic outlet syndrome and axillary-subclavian occlusion represented 3.5% of the 969 patients treated for thoracic outlet syndrome during the same period. Nonlethal pulmonary embolization from the axillary-subclavian vein occurred in four patients. Sixty percent of patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms during strenuous exercise at last follow-up (mean, 5.4 years). Forty-eight of these 56 patients had received anticoagulation during the acute phase of the disease. Twenty-seven percent of patients had symptoms with moderate exercise and 12.6% had symptoms at rest. Thirteen patients had operations, with improvement demonstrable in 10 patients. All five patients who underwent first rib resection for intermittent venous occlusion or for thoracic outlet syndrome after thrombosis occurred on the contralateral side did well. Axillary-subclavian venous occlusion is a nonlethal disease but late sequelae occur in one third of patients. Early anticoagulation appears to be beneficial and, in some patients with concomitant thoracic outlet syndrome, first rib resection also appears to be helpful. Further data are needed to evaluate results of fibrinolytic treatment, thrombectomy, and venous reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Relationships between femoral artery pulsatility index (PI) (a number calculated from Doppler-derived arterial blood velocity waveforms) and three directly measured physiologic parameters (proximal artery stenosis, blood pressure index (BPI), and blood flow) were studied in a canine model. All combinations of stenoses were constructed, including 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% reduction in a cross-sectional area in the infrarenal aorta and/or left common iliac artery of 14 animals. PIs, BPIs, and mean blood flows were measured for each stenosis pattern at both the right (control) and left femoral arteries. Three groups were studied--group I, the left femoral artery remained open; group II, the left femoral artery was ligated; and group III, a left femoral arteriovenous fistula was constructed. Correlations between reductions in femoral artery PI and increasing arterial stenosis as well as decreasing BPI and blood flow were obtained. However, positive correlations were weak and only recognized when high-grade stenoses were present. Moreover, these correlations were further influenced by the multiplicity of stenoses present as well as flow velocity into the distal arterial bed. These data suggest that PI lacks the sensitivity to be a clinically useful diagnostic test.",

    "abstract": "Although various techniques to determine amputation level have become available, obvious clinical factors may yet identify patients in whom a major amputation is unlikely to heal. We have analyzed the association of multiple clinical factors with the morbidity of 1028 consecutive amputations performed in 786 patients during a 13-year period. The overall operative mortality rate was 7% (57 of 786 patients). Cardiac complications were the leading cause of death (43%). In the 729 patients surviving operation, 345 above-knee amputations (AKAs) and 626 below-knee amputations (BKAs) were performed. After operation, 15.4% of these amputations failed to heal and required proximal revision. The AKA failure rate was 9% and the BKA failure rate was 19%. Significantly higher failure rates were noted in whites, nondiabetics, and those patients with heart disease. It is concluded that major amputation continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates despite changes in perioperative care and surgical technique. Common clinical characteristics indicate high-risk patients in whom a BKA is unlikely to heal and who may benefit from prospective attempts to determine amputation level.",

    "abstract": "To date our use of angioscopy as an adjunct to in situ vein grafting, arterial embolectomy, femoropopliteal bypass surgery, and laser recanalization has been studied in 11 patients. Three angioscopes have been used: a 1.7 mm optiscope, a 2.8 mm laser optiscope, and a 3.2 mm bronchoscope. Scopes were introduced through an arteriotomy and a clear field maintained by continuous saline infusion. Twenty-four angioscopic evaluations were performed in the 14 patients studied. Adequate visualization was achieved with all three scopes. Angioscopy showed total atherosclerotic occlusion of six superficial femoral and popliteal arteries, intimal flaps in two arteries, thrombus in two arteries and one graft, adequate valvulotomy in three saphenous veins used for in situ bypass grafting, and removal of thrombus after embolectomy in one artery. With the 2.8 mm laser optiscope, the optical fiber used for laser recanalization could be positioned at the site of arterial occlusion before lasing and recanalization were done under direct vision. The 1.7 mm scope could be passed through the recanalized artery to inspect the channel and confirm communication with the artery distal to the occlusion. Thus, angioscopy appears to be potentially useful as a diagnostic device in arterial occlusive disease and as an adjunct in in situ saphenous vein grafting or laser recanalization of occluded arterial segments.",

    "abstract": "Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HATT) is an unusual but serious complication of heparin therapy. Twenty-five patients (13 men and 12 women) had thrombocytopenia and arterial or venous thrombosis 1 to 10 days (mean, 6.3 days) after the start of heparin administration. The vessels in the affected extremity had been entered for catheterization, arteriography, or passage of a balloon counterpulsation device in 19 of the 25 patients. In vitro platelet aggregation with heparin was seen in all patients. Additional studies were performed to see whether other lots or sources of heparin also produced in vitro aggregation. Four separate lots of beef lung heparin, commercial heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa, and two types of low molecular weight heparin were all highly stimulatory in this system. However, Org 10172, a heparinoid, did not induce aggregation in any of 13 patient plasmas tested. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin was also examined. Aspirin abolished in vitro aggregation in 9 of 16 cases and decreased the degree of aggregation from 85% to 55% (p = 0.02) in the remaining seven cases. We conclude that in patients with HATT platelet aggregation is equally induced by beef lung, porcine intestinal, and some forms of low molecular weight heparin. Org 10172 does not stimulate platelet aggregation in plasma from these patients in vitro. Finally, there may be a role for aspirin in treating patients with HATT.",

All patients underwent immediate reoperation, and thromboses were confirmed in 26 of the 33 patients (79%). In the seven patients without thromboses, findings at reoperation accounted for the abnormal physiology in six of the seven patients. Overall, in 32 of the 33 patients (97%) the recovery room OPG tests accurately reflected a source of hemodynamic compromise. The application of the special OPG-Gee criteria in this report will minimize needless reoperation after carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "During a 5-year period, 212 patients (170 men and 42 women, median age 65 and 64 years, respectively) were diagnosed as having internal carotid artery occlusion. Mean follow-up was 24.9 months. Five-year cumulative survival and stroke-free rates by life-table analysis were 62% and 75%, respectively. Deaths were due to stroke in 7 of 40 patients (17%) and were of cardiac origin in 22 of 40 patients (55%). The strokes were ipsilateral in 20 of 31 patients (65%). No statistically significant difference between the sexes could be demonstrated for either death or stroke, nor was age correlated with stroke during follow-up. Diabetes and hypertension increased the risk of stroke, whereas gender and aspirin consumption had no discernible effect. Endarterectomy of the opposite carotid artery did not significantly affect the natural history but did reduce the stroke rate in the territory of the operated artery. Presenting symptoms were useful for estimating prognosis. Twenty-two of 111 patients referred for stroke (20%) suffered a further stroke and 21 of 111 patients (19%) died (three were stroke-related), whereas of those patients referred for transient ischemic attack (TIA), only 2 of 42 patients (5%) suffered a stroke and none died. TIAs occurred in 23 patients (11%) during follow-up, and these were premonitory for stroke in three cases (13%). The limited value of TIA in predicting stroke and the high mortality rate unrelated to stroke in this group are important considerations when therapy is considered for these patients.",

    "abstract": "During a 28-year period from 1955 to 1983, two cases of massive repetitive arterial thromboembolism from nonaneurysmal aortic mural thrombus were diagnosed antemortem and successfully corrected at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. Within the same time period, 48 cases of nonaneurysmal aortic mural thrombus were identified in 10,671 consecutive autopsies (0.45% incidence). Eight of these patients had evidence of distal embolization (17%), and three had major thromboembolic occlusions, which were considered the proximate cause of death (6%). The latter three patients represented 9% of autopsy-confirmed deaths from peripheral arterial thromboembolism. The diagnosis was established in a 49-year-old man and a 51-year-old woman after a long course marked by recurrent arterial embolization. Despite multiple evaluations, which included angiography, the diagnosis remained elusive until clinical suspicion resulted in complete biplane aortographic survey. Although the morphologic characteristics of this lesion are quite striking, subtle angiographic changes and lack of familiarity with the clinical presentation contribute to the difficulty and infrequency of diagnosis. This unique lesion comprises an important segment of the so-called cryptogenic sources of arterial embolization and can be corrected by a definitive surgical procedure.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed the experience of 120 vascular surgeons with nonresective therapy for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in medically unstable patients. Of a total pool of 206 patients, 88 underwent iliac artery ligation, which was combined with angiographic attempts at intrasaccular thrombosis in 80% of cases. The remaining 118 patients had ligation of the aneurysm proximally and distally. In all cases distal perfusion was restored, usually by axillofemoral bypass. Our study demonstrated a significantly higher risk of postoperative AAA rupture (20% vs. 3.3%, p less than 0.0001) and death (34% vs. 5.1%, p less than 0.000001) among patients treated by ligation distal to the AAA alone, whether intrasaccular thrombosis occurred or not. These results support the contention that if nonresective therapy is chosen for the occasional patient deemed too ill to undergo standard AAA resection, AAA exclusion by proximal and distal ligation should be performed.",

    "abstract": "With the recent development of successful methods to correct valve incompetence in the lower extremity, there is a need for a standardized approach to descending venography. This is the single test that accurately defines the site of the venous valve and demonstrates its competence or degree of incompetence. This report describes a technique of descending venography, including the details of catheter placement, injection procedure, and monitoring techniques. Interpretation of the study requires a method that analyzes both the individual valve function and the overall valvular competence of the entire extremity. Descending venography can separate patients with primary valve incompetence from those with postthrombotic valve destruction, as well as the occasional case of valve aplasia. Points on interpretation of valve function and the use of the Valsalva maneuver for \"stressing\" the valve are discussed. The descending venographic results are compared with the clinical state and with venous pressure findings in 78 extremities.",

    "abstract": "Survivors of ischemic stroke are at high risk of sustaining recurrent strokes, which tend to be more severe and are often fatal. Controversy exists regarding whether or not carotid endarterectomy (CEA) achieves its objectives of preventing recurrent stroke and reducing subsequent death in such patients. Therefore, we analyzed the records of 275 consecutive patients who underwent 350 CEAs between 1977 and 1983 and identified 95 patients (34.5%) who had suffered a preoperative stroke, which was the primary indication for operation. All had either full recovery (13.7%) or only mild (63.2%) or moderate (23.1%) neurologic deficits at the time of operation. Patients with severe deficits did not undergo operation. The operations were performed whenever the neurologic recovery had reached a plateau, without a specific interim waiting period between the stroke and the operation. The combined operative morbidity/mortality rate was 2.7% (three patients), both deaths caused by stroke in patients with mild preoperative neurologic deficits and one (0.9%) nonfatal postoperative stroke involving the retina in a patient who also had a mild preoperative deficit. Long-term follow-up averaged 32 months (range, 6 to 72 months). No ipsilateral recurrent strokes occurred during this period after CEA. Life-table analysis revealed a recurrent stroke rate of 3.2% (0.64% per year) and a 5-year survival rate of 81.3%. Patients who were neurologically normal at the time of operation had a cumulative 5-year survival rate of 90.9%. None of the late deaths was due to recurrent stroke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Clinical, arteriographic, and vascular diagnostic laboratory (VDL) data on 157 patients undergoing aortobifemoral bypass (ABF/BP) more than 5 years previously were compared in terms of the perspective provided by noninvasive testing, particularly when performed in the face of superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusion. To the traditional outcome criteria (operative mortality rate, 3.2%; amputation rate, 1.4%; early patency rate, 98%; and late patency rate, 86%), VDL data added an initial hemodynamic failure rate of 14% and a late deterioration rate of 8%. Those patients with occluded SFAs fared worse in regard to initial patency (94% vs. 100%), initial hemodynamic failure (29% vs. 2%), late deterioration (8.8% vs. 5.4%), and late failure rates (16% vs. 10%), whereas those patients with open SFAs suffered more distal disease progression (11.5% vs. 1.3%). \"Prediction\" of postoperative ankle/brachial index (ABI) from preoperative thigh/brachial index (TBI) and ABI was 92% accurate for limbs with open SFAs but only 84% for limbs with occluded SFAs; prediction was made with a formula based on proportional transmission and with TBI measured with a regularly sized cuff (best combination). Neither additive transmission formula nor measurement of TBI with a large cuff allowed accurate prediction when the SFA was occluded. No advantage, in terms of initial hemodynamic result or late outcome, could be demonstrated for limited profundaplasty in the absence of significant profunda femoral stenosis and end-to-end vs. end-to-side proximal anastomosis.",

Seventy-three arteriograms were reviewed to identify early and late graft defects; arteriographic findings paralleled those described for saphenous vein grafts. Intimal fibrosis during the first postoperative year, observed in 16 grafts, was the most common defect. Aneurysmosis and elongation were rare, resulting in two graft replacements. Patency and limb salvage rates were calculated for 88 single-length femorodistal bypass grafts; the other 72 were inflow (eight) or outflow (22) jump grafts, sequential (eight) and composite autogenous vein grafts (34). The primary and secondary patency rates for single-length grafts were 74% and 80% at 1 year and 51% and 57% at 5 years, respectively. The limb salvage rate at 5 years was 82%. The survival rate for all patients was 44% at 5 years. These findings reconfirm our use of arm veins as bypass grafts when the saphenous vein is unavailable.",

With receiver operating characteristic curves, the study documents the accuracy of the Doppler technique for the diagnosis of extracranial carotid arterial stenosis greater than 45% diameter reduction. It confirms the accuracy of the measurement of the maximal peak Doppler frequency and, in addition, shows that quantitative analysis of the instantaneous Doppler spectrum at peak systole by the measurement of the spectral broadening index is of diagnostic value. Likelihood ratios have been calculated with the use of curve-fitting techniques and it has been demonstrated how both the peak frequency and the spectral broadening index can be used together to improve the certainty of diagnosis. It is concluded that the probability that an individual patient has significant carotid arterial disease can be determined with the measurements of peak frequency and spectral broadening index from the continuous-wave Doppler spectral waveform.",

    "abstract": "In this study we compare intraoperative B-mode imaging with arteriography in the same patient for intraoperative assessment after carotid endarterectomy. Since April 1983, 158 patients have been studied with both techniques. After a routine intraoperative arteriogram, the vessel was examined in multiple planes with a B-mode imager, and the impression of the operating surgeon was recorded before review of the arteriogram. Thirteen studies were unsatisfactory because the design of the probe did not allow examination of the high carotid bifurcation. Twelve patients had significant abnormalities (8.3%) in the internal carotid artery. Results were false negative in three intraoperative arteriograms (2.1%) and five B-mode imaging studies (3.4%). In each of the 12 cases the vessel was reopened and the abnormality confirmed and corrected. Fifty-seven patients had abnormalities (37%) in the external carotid artery. Results were false negative in eight arteriograms (5.3%) and in 12 B-mode imaging studies (7.9%). Fourteen of the 57 patients with abnormalities of the external carotid artery underwent repeat operation to correct the technical problem. Although not conclusive, the incidence of postoperative neurologic deficit as well as that of recurrent carotid stenosis seems decreased since both modalities for intraoperative assessment were used. The data suggest that neither intraoperative angiography nor B-mode imaging, when used alone, accurately detects all postoperative abnormalities. The results also suggest that a heightened sensitivity to technical details may improve both early and late postoperative morbidity.",

    "abstract": "We retrospectively studied the results of duplex scanning for evaluation of renal artery disease in 158 patients. Satisfactory examinations were achieved in 144 patients (90%). Arteriograms were available for 43 renal arteries. We used the ratio of the peak velocities in the renal artery and the aorta (RAR) to separate nonstenotic arteries (less than 60% diameter reduction) from stenotic arteries (greater than 60% diameter reduction). With an RAR of greater than 3.5 to indicate stenotic lesions, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 91% (20 of 22 diseased arteries correctly identified) and specificity of 95% (20 of 21 normal or insignificantly diseased arteries correctly identified). One of four occluded arteries was incorrectly interpreted as patent because of misidentification of a collateral vessel. Prospective studies will be necessary to validate this test and establish other criteria for a more detailed classification of renal artery stenosis. The ratio of the end-diastolic to peak systolic velocities in the renal artery (EDR) tended to decrease with increasing serum creatinine levels, presumably because renal vascular resistance increases with end-stage parenchymal disease. EDR may prove useful in the detection of advanced parenchymal disease before renal artery revascularization is attempted.",

Clinical symptoms were recorded and the following noninvasive venous vascular laboratory tests were performed: Doppler examination to determine venous valve competence and photoplethysmography to measure ambulatory venous pressure and venous recovery time. Twenty-eight control subjects underwent similar examination. Although only 10 of 47 patients (21%) were asymptomatic, venous ulceration had developed in only two patients. The symptomatic patients had varying degrees of edema, pigmentation, and varicosities. Eighty-three percent of DVT patients had abnormal vascular laboratory findings. Both the severity of clinical symptoms and the magnitude of the hemodynamic abnormalities generally correlated with the extent of the initial thrombus. However, only 47% of patients whose initial thrombus appeared limited to the calf were asymptomatic, and only 25% of this group had normal venous hemodynamic findings. This study indicates that 5 to 10 years after lower extremity DVT 80% of patients will have both symptoms and abnormal venous hemodynamics regardless of the initial site of the thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Nitroglycerin (NTG) is often administered to improve hemodynamics during aortic occlusion (AO). This investigation was designed to characterize the effect of NTG on left ventricular oxygen extraction during thoracic aortic occlusion. Open-chest dogs (n = 12) underwent measurement of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and coronary blood flow. The great cardiac vein (GCV) was cannulated. AO was produced by a balloon in the descending aorta. Arterial and GCV oxygen content were determined before, 30 seconds, and 10 minutes after AO (control occlusions). Oxygen extraction (A-V)O2, oxygen consumption, and cardiac work were calculated. AO was repeated during NTG infusion (2 micrograms/kg/min IV) in seven animals. (A-V)O2 was decreased 10% at 30 seconds in control occlusions. NTG exacerbated these decreases in oxygen extraction. With NTG, (A-V)O2 decreased by 33% despite a 12% increase in cardiac work. The fact that early decreases in oxygen extraction occurring after AO are accentuated by NTG may predispose patients undergoing aortic reconstruction who receive NTG to myocardial ischemia.",

All three patients were elderly diabetic men with multilevel occlusive disease associated with rest pain and ischemic lesions of the feet. IOTLA allowed recanalization of segmentally occluded distal vessels or dilatation of multiple distal severe stenoses. These lesions would have been inaccessible to usual percutaneous angioplasty techniques because of intervening occlusions in the thigh. The technique and instrumentation of IOTLA are described. All patients had intraoperative prereconstruction and completion arteriography. In femorotibial bypass grafting, the adjunctive use of IOTLA improved runoff and graft patency to target vessels that would otherwise have been unsuitable. Although the experience is limited and the follow-up period short, the early results are encouraging; the technique deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict successful healing of ulcerations and amputations of the ischemic forefoot continues to be a major clinical challenge, particularly in diabetic patients whose systolic Doppler ankle pressures are often artifactually elevated. We have used the techniques of laser Doppler velocimetry (LD) and transcutaneous oxygen tension monitoring (tcPO2) to quantitatively measure skin blood flow in the distal foot. Fifty-nine limbs were studied (48 patients), of which 37 (63%) were in diabetic and 22 (37%) in nondiabetic patients. All patients were admitted with ischemic ulcerations or gangrenous changes of the forefoot or digit. Twenty transmetatarsal or digital amputations were performed; the remainder of the lesions were d\u00e9brided and allowed to heal by secondary intention or were covered by a skin graft. Before operation, the systolic pressure (expressed in millimeters of mercury, mean +/- SEM) was measured by Doppler technique at the ankle, and the ankle/arm index calculated (n = 59 limbs). The tcPO2 (also expressed in millimeters of mercury, mean +/- SEM) was measured from the dorsal foot (n = 56). The baseline skin blood flow velocity (SBFV) and pulse wave amplitude (PWA) were measured with the LD (expressed in millivolts, mean +/- SEM) on the plantar aspect of the foot (n = 53 limbs). Criteria for successful healing included a tcPO2 of more than 10 mm Hg, the combination of an LD-SBFV of more than 40 mV and an LD-PWA of more than 4 mV, and an ankle systolic pressure of more than 30 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The rate of aneurysm formation in umbilical vein grafts has been reported to lie between 1% and 8%. However, in these reported series the number of grafts with aneurysms was related to the number of grafts inserted. When the denominator is changed to patent grafts at a given time period, the incidence changes drastically. In this study, duplex scanning was used to detect aneurysms in patent grafts. Four types of aneurysms--localized fusiform, localized eccentric, diffuse, and anastomotic--were recognized. Excluding anastomotic aneurysms, 33% of the grafts patent at 3 years were aneurysmal; in those patent at 4 years, 45% were aneurysmal; and in those patent at 5 or more years, 65% were aneurysmal. On grounds of theoretical considerations, it is believed that duplex scanning is more reliable than either clinical examination or arteriographic study for detecting these aneurysms. There is now evidence that the supporting Dacron mesh is too weak and must be strengthened. Despite aneurysm formation, the patency rate in our series has remained second only to saphenous vein grafts, as previously reported.",

The patient later had night sweats, a left pleural effusion, and a tender abdominal mass thought to be a symptomatic aneurysm. At operation, the aorta was necrotic and had an inflammatory mass and perforation on the left side. Infrarenal aortic ligation and resection were performed to control infection. A previously placed axillofemoral graft obviated the need for concomitant revascularization. The patient was treated postoperatively with isoniazid and rifampin until hyperbilirubinemia developed, which necessitated alternate therapy with ethambutol and streptomycin.

The thrombus culture was positive for Candida albicans, and the reestablishment of vein patency in conjunction with amphotericin B therapy resulted in cure. This technique allows a definitive diagnosis of septic central thrombosis to be made and reestablishment of vein patency may also enhance antibiotic therapy.",

    "abstract": "One hundred patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) have been followed up for 3 to 10 years (mean, 5.5 years). Seven patients have been lost to follow-up but none is recorded as dead (National Registry of Deaths) at least 5 years after operation. Fifteen patients (16.5%) have died, four from cerebral and eight from cardiac causes. Three patients had cerebral infarction with permanent deficits, one occurring immediately after operation, one at 3 months, and one at 9 years. Four patients had minor strokes but a full clinical recovery, three patients postoperatively and one patient at 4 years. Fourteen patients had ipsilateral TIAs, four occurred postoperatively and 10 occurred from 1 to 8 years later. Ten patients had contralateral TIAs and five patients then had a contralateral carotid endarterectomy. Another nine patients also had bilateral operations, three for bilateral TIAs, five as prophylactic procedures on the basis of arteriographic findings, and one for a contralateral cerebral event that occurred after arteriography. Thus, at the mean follow-up time (5.5 years) and including the operative complications, four deaths (4%) of cerebral origin and seven serious cerebral problems (7%) have occurred--an annual morbidity and mortality rate of less than 2%. This compares favorably with the commonly predicted rate of stroke occurring after TIAs of 5% per year. These figures support the argument that carotid endarterectomy reduces the incidence of stroke occurring after TIA and stops TIAs caused by emboli from the carotid bifurcation.",

    "abstract": "Anticoagulation is the cornerstone in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. However, the treatment of septic deep vein thrombosis is controversial. Unlike septic superficial vein thrombosis, venous excision is often associated with limb-threatening or even life-threatening complications. Some authors have suggested thrombectomy as the only means of resolving the sepsis. We reviewed our experience with seven patients who had septic deep vein thrombosis. Phlebography or noninvasive studies documented deep vein thrombosis and blood cultures were positive in all patients. The mean age was 31.5 years with a male/female ratio of 5:2. All patients were treated with anticoagulants and intravenous antibiotics. One patient required surgical exploration for associated abscess of the groin. The patients became afebrile with normal white blood cell counts from 3 to 18 days after therapy was begun. No cases of recurrent sepsis occurred. We conclude that antibiotic therapy and anticoagulation are adequate treatment and therefore consider venous thrombectomy unnecessary.",

Eighteen patients referred for evaluation of asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques had a 50% incidence of ipsilateral carotid bifurcation disease, but only 16% of these were considered surgically remediable; five of these patients eventually required carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Nine of the 18 patients with asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques were further evaluated with serial ocular fundus photography: the plaque persisted in all nine patients--in four for more than 6 months and in five for more than 1 year. No patient had transient or fixed retinal or cerebral symptoms. Twenty-six patients with amaurosis fugax showed a 70% incidence of significant bifurcation disease and three had significant intracranial disease; 50% eventually required CEA. Twelve patients with fixed visual deficits (four patients had homonymous hemianopsia, four had retinal artery occlusions, and four had ischemic retinopathies) demonstrated a 100% incidence of bifurcation disease, but in addition 85% had significant intracranial disease; only one of this group had surgically amenable disease. Amaurosis fugax preceded blindness in two patients. Hollenhorst plaque as an isolated phenomenon appears to be a retinal embolic event of uncertain age, with poor predictive power for further embolic events, and not as highly correlated with significant or surgically amenabe carotid bifurcation disease.",

    "abstract": "Surgical management of major venous injuries remains controversial. The medical records of 184 patients with major venous injury were reviewed. Forty-three patients had isolated venous injury; 31 of 43 patients (72%) underwent ligation to treat their vein injury. Another 141 patients had combined arterial and venous injury; 117 of these patients (83%) had ligation. Injured were the inferior vena cava, iliac, femoral, popliteal, distal leg, and arm veins; all patients underwent surgical exploration. Arterial injuries were repaired by standard techniques and venous injuries were either ligated or repaired by end-to-end or lateral phleborrhaphy. Adjunctive fasciotomy was used when clinically indicated. The patients were followed up for 1 month to 9 years. No permanent sequelae of venous ligation were identified. Transient extremity edema developed in up to 32% of patients, regardless of whether vein ligation or repair was performed. This edema resolved completely within 12 weeks of the injury. No extremity was lost after ligation of a venous injury. Although it may be ideal to repair all venous vascular injuries, selective management reflecting mechanism of injury, blood loss, anesthesia requirements, associated organ injury, and other concerns may mitigate against extensive venous repair.",

    "abstract": "Ex vivo renal artery surgery has been reported by several investigators and has extended the role of revascularization in the treatment of lesions previously managed by nephrectomy alone. Several techniques are available for use, and selection of the most appropriate method can be tailored to the specific anatomy being managed. Our total experience included 27 kidneys that have been managed by ex vivo renal artery reconstruction. Lesions managed in this manner include two kidneys with renal artery stenosis and renal tumors, one kidney with a congenital branch arteriovenous malformation, and 24 kidneys with branch occlusive or aneurysmal disease from fibromuscular dysplasia. Postoperative angiography was performed in 22 cases and defined successful revascularization without technical error in 20 cases. One operative death occurred as a result of myocardial infarction. One patient required reoperation to control bleeding, and two patients had temporary acute tubular necrosis during the postoperative period. Techniques employed included ex vivo repair with autotransplantation to the iliac system (six kidneys), mobilization and perfusion without transection of the renal vein (10 kidneys), and ex vivo perfusion and repair with replacement into the original renal fossa (11 kidneys). The authors believe this latter technique of reconstruction to be preferable to autotransplantation for the usual patient undergoing ex vivo repair of complex renovascular lesions.",

This study compares Doppler frequency analyses in 22 patients with reversed veins and in 21 patients with in situ femoropopliteal vein grafts. Signals from the common femoral artery, the femoral anastomosis, and the vein in the mid thigh were analyzed and the pulsatility index (PI) and flow disturbance index (FDI) calculated (FDI = maximum frequency divided by median frequency). The two groups were similar clinically and common femoral artery PI showed inflow to be similar and satisfactory. Marked turbulence occurred at the femoral anastomosis where peak FDI rose from 1.67 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- SD) to 2.96 +/- 0.69 in the in situ vein group and from 1.74 +/- 0.51 to 3.11 +/- 0.64 in the reversed vein group (p less than 0.001). This turbulence was much reduced at mid thigh level where peak FDI had fallen to 1.45 +/- 0.17 in the reversed vein group and 1.51 +/- 0.23 in the in situ vein group (p less than 0.001). Comparison of the signals from the femoral anastomosis and from the vein at mid thigh showed that the amount of flow disturbance was no different in the in situ vein group from that in the reversed vein group (unpaired t test). In this study flow patterns were not improved by use of the in situ bypass technique.",

    "abstract": "The improved patency rates that have been claimed for in situ femoropopliteal vein bypass have been attributed to improved hemodynamics because of the natural taper of the vein and maintenance of wall compliance because of preservation of the nutrient vasa vasorum. Blood flow in 31 in situ and 21 reversed vein grafts was measured noninvasively with a duplex ultrasound scanner at a median of 6 months after operation. There was no significant difference in the resting or hyperemic flows between the two groups (p much greater than 0.1). The compliance of 15 undisturbed and 15 fully mobilized in situ vein grafts was measured noninvasively by Doppler ultrasonography immediately after operation and at 3 months. There was a significant fall in compliance in both groups (p less than 0.001) but no significant difference between them (p much greater than 0.1). We have been unable to demonstrate any significant hemodynamic advantage with the in situ technique but believe that its use is still justified because of technically easier anastomoses and an improved utilization rate. Preservation of the vasa vasorum does not maintain wall compliance and complete mobilization of the vein relieves any uneven tension and ensures that all venous tributaries are ligated, removing the risk of arteriovenous fistulas.",

    "abstract": "Reliable enzymatic endothelial cell (EC) harvest methods are required for clinical EC seeding of vascular prostheses by methods analogous to those demonstrated in dogs. But crude collagenases used for EC harvest vary in efficacy and cytotoxicity, and purified collagenases reportedly give low EC yields. To compare different harvest methods, we studied growth curves of primary adult human saphenous vein EC (HSVEC) harvests plated in replicate microwell cultures. The EC yield, defined as attachment-capable ECs obtained per square centimeter of vein lumen, was estimated from the lowest number of ECs counted in lag phase before exponential growth began. With the use of morphometric studies of HSVs that were perfusion-fixed at their original dimensions, the baseline in situ density of ECs available for harvest from HSV was estimated at 1.3 X 10(5) EC/cm2. Crude (CBC) and partially purified bacterial collagenase (PBC) solutions at concentrations with equal levels of basement membrane lysis activity (BMLA) were compared by the replicate microwell method in a series of 21 harvests (six CBC, eight PBC, and seven enzyme-free control harvests). All 14 enzymatic harvests produced confluent EC cultures with no significant difference in mean harvest efficiency between CBC (12% of in situ EC number) and PBC (15%). However, PBC caused less degradation of human fibronectin (p less than 0.0001) as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employing a fibronectin-specific monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that chemically defined mixtures of pure enzymes with BMLA equal to the BMLA of crude collagenase might allow reliable EC harvesting without sacrifice in EC yield but with improved preservation of structures at the EC periphery. EC losses during initial vein dissection may have contributed to the low 12% to 15% efficiency we observed.",
