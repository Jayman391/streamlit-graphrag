    "abstract": "The clinical significance of celiac artery compression by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm remains unsettled. The controversy stems from an undefined pathophysiologic mechanism and the existence of celiac compression in asymptomatic patients. This study was therefore conducted to evaluate the late results of operative therapy among our patients and possibly to identify parameters that might correlate with sustained symptom relief. Among 51 patients (12 men and 39 women) (mean age 47 years) who underwent operative treatment for symptomatic celiac artery compression, 44 (86%) were available for late follow-up. Their clinical status was determined between 1 and 18 years postoperatively (mean 9.0 years) by patient interview (36) or chart review (7). Operative treatment consisted of celiac axis decompression only (16 patients), celiac decompression and dilatation (17 patients), or celiac decompression and reconstruction by primary reanastomosis or interposition grafting (18 patients). Sustained symptom relief occurred more often with a postprandial pain pattern (81% cure), age between 40 and 60 years (77%), and weight loss of 20 pounds or more (67%). A negative correlation with clinical improvement was demonstrated for an atypical pain pattern with periods of remission (43% cure), a history of psychiatric disorder or alcohol abuse (40%), age greater than 60 years (40%), and weight loss of less than 20 pounds (53%). Eight of 15 patients (53%) treated by celiac decompression alone remained asymptomatic at late follow-up in contrast to 22 of 29 patients (76%) treated by celiac decompression plus some form of celiac revascularization. Late follow-up arteriograms (18 studies) showed a widely patent celiac artery in 70% of asymptomatic patients but a stenosed or occluded celiac axis in 75% of symptomatic patients. These findings suggest that persistent clinical improvement in patients with symptomatic celiac axis compression can be achieved by an operative technique that ensures celiac axis patency. Although some clinical features are identified that correlate with long-term benefit, reliable diagnosis of the symptomatic patient awaits definition of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in this syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The merit of carotid endarterectomy for patients who previously have sustained a completed stroke remains controversial. Between January 1976 and December 1983, 118 stroke patients with mild to severe permanent neurologic deficits were evaluated. Fifty-nine patients were managed nonoperatively and 59 operatively. Both cohorts were similar in age and sex distribution, incidence of hypertension (69%), diabetes mellitus (25%), and cardiac disease (39%). In the long-term follow-up (medical cohort average was 44.1 +/- 5.0 months; surgical cohort average, 41.8 +/- 3.7 months) the overall survival rate was comparable, that is, there were nine medical deaths and eight surgical deaths. However, there was a significant difference in the development of new neurologic deficits. Twelve of the 59 unoperated patients had new neurologic deficits and three patients died at 12, 36, and 48 months as a result of a recurrent stroke. New neurologic deficits developed in only two of the 59 surgical patients and there were no stroke-related deaths. When the cumulative probability of remaining free from recurrent deficits was examined in the surviving patients at 6 years, all of the patients in the operated group remained free from recurrent deficits, whereas only 58% of the patients in the unoperated group were free of new neurologic deficits (p = 0.02). These data suggest that stroke patients with fixed mild to moderate neurologic deficits and with carotid lesions may be protected from recurrent neurologic complications by carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the role of selective intra-arterial low-dose thrombolytic therapy (SILDT) as an alternative to the surgical management of acute arterial occlusion, the hospital records of 40 patients who underwent 43 SILDT treatments with either streptokinase (36) or urokinase (7) between December 1979 and March 1984 were reviewed. Twenty-eight patients underwent 30 treatments (group 1) for native arterial occlusion and 12 patients underwent 13 treatments (group 2) for prosthetic or autogenous graft occlusions. Therapy was deemed successful if subsequent surgical therapy was obviated. In group 1, SILDT was successful in 13 of 28 (45%) patients with 12 of 25 lower extremity occlusions and one of three upper extremity occlusions. Successful lysis in the native artery occlusion group fell into three categories: five patients were successfully treated for arterial thrombosis complicating percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA); four patients required PTA after complete lysis revealed an underlying arterial stenosis; and only three required no further therapy after SILDT. SILDT failed in all three patients with the aortoiliac occlusions. Eleven patients with femoral artery occlusions and unsuccessful SILDT required six bypass procedures, three amputations, one embolectomy, and one PTA. In group 2 only 3 of 14 treatments (21%) were successful. Bypass revision was not possible in 11 patients and all required amputation. Systemic fibrinolysis was seen in 20 (59%) of 34 patients with available data. Neither fibrinogen levels nor fibrin degradation products predicted the occurrence of complications. Minor complications occurred in 18 of 43 (43%) treatments; small hematomas at the catheter entry site were most common. Minor complications occurred in 20 of 43 treatments (44%) and included severe local hemorrhage (four), distant bleeding (three), pulmonary embolism (four), myocardial infarction (three), unmasking of an aortoduodenal fistula (one), and clot migration requiring emergency thrombectomy (four). SILDT is most effective in acute arterial thrombosis complicating arteriography or percutaneous angioplasty. It may play a role in the patient in whom thrombolysis can reveal an underlying stenosis amenable to percutaneous angioplasty. This experience shows SILDT to be of limited value in the management of prosthetic autogenous graft occlusions. Finally, thrombolytic therapy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and requires cautious monitoring to detect arterial thrombus migration, worsening tissue ischemia, venous thromboembolism, intracerebral hemorrhage, and local or systemic bleeding.",

    "abstract": "Free radicals have been implicated in the damage caused by tissue ischemia and reperfusion. Canine kidneys were subjected to a 60-minute period of normothermic ischemia. One group of animals received intra-arterial superoxide dismutase (SOD, 17.6 mg/50 ml, 50,000 units) at the end of the ischemic period, whereas a second group received albumin (17.6 mg/50 ml). The kidneys treated with SOD demonstrated significantly less edema formation (1.0 +/- 0.3% wet weight vs. 1.8 +/- 0.2%, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) and lower renovascular resistance (44.0 +/- 5.6 dynes-sec/cm5 vs. 64.0 +/- 12.0, p less than 0.05). The SOD group displayed greater preservation of both glomerular filtration rate (45.9 +/- 6.1% of baseline vs. 23.7 +/- 5.8%, p less than 0.05) and urine flow (1.3 +/- 0.4 ml/min vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the free radical scavenger SOD provides significant protection of the kidney during ischemia and reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "The operative mortality rate for abdominal aortic aneurysm resection remains high (20% to 66%) for high-risk patients. The high-risk factors are severe cardiac, respiratory, and renal insufficiency and morbid obesity. Those advocating the alternative nonresective treatment of aneurysm thrombosis and axillofemoral bypass grafts have reduced the operative mortality rate to between 0% and 7%. However, in a collective series of 87 patients, there was a mortality rate of 10.3% in the patients with aortic aneurysms treated by the nonresective method and an incidence of reoperation for complications of axillofemoral graft of 31.0%. Many of these patients had subsequent operations and/or radiologic procedures to complete the process of aneurysm thrombosis (23.0%). Because there is an increasing trend toward this method of treatment, we reviewed our experience with the conventional aneurysm resection in a similar group of patients. Of 105 consecutive patients, 19 qualified as high risk. One patient died, resulting in an operative mortality rate of 5.2%. Cerebral, cardiac, and renal morbidity was transient and subsequent operations were not required. Eighteen patients were discharged as well. In the remaining 86 patients, one died, resulting in an operative mortality rate of 1.2%. The mortality rate for the entire series was 1.9%. Indications for the nonresective treatment appear to be increasing by the addition of other risk factors. This trend is of concern. We believe that there are limited indications for the treatment of aortic aneurysms without resection. However, the procedure should not be offered lightly as an alternative form of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive transcutaneous PO2 (TcpO2) determinations have been developed to study peripheral arterial occlusive disease. To evaluate this technique as a predictor of amputation outcome, a blind, prospective study of 101 patients undergoing 119 amputations (23 above-knee [AK], 57 below-knee [BK], and 39 forefoot) was performed. TcpO2 measurements were obtained from the dorsum of the foot and 10 cm distal to the patella, both prior to and 10 minutes after inhalation of 100% oxygen. On the basis of preliminary results, initial TcpO2 values greater than 10 mm Hg or an increase greater than 10 mm Hg after oxygen inhalation were considered to predict a successful outcome, whereas failure was predicted when the initial TcpO2 value was less than 10 mm Hg and the increase after oxygen inhalation did not exceed the 10 mm Hg level. In the BK amputation group the test was 95% sensitive, 100% specific, and 95% accurate. Retrospective utilization of the above criteria in patients who had undergone both oxygen inhalation testing and AK amputation suggested that 9 of 17 limbs (53%) might have undergone a more distal BK amputation successfully. These results document the effectiveness of an initial TcpO2 determination coupled with the response to 100% oxygen inhalation as an excellent predictor of the outcome of lower extremity amputations.",

    "abstract": "Historically, patients with mild to moderate neurologic deficits lasting longer than 24 hours were believed to have sustained a completed stroke. They were followed up for 4 to 6 weeks and cerebral angiography was performed if indicated. CT scanning has identified a subset of these patients who have sustained a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) rather than a completed stroke. The timing for angiography and surgery for this group has not been established. In an earlier study we found that 21% (4 of 19 patients) suffered a second stroke during the 4- to 6-week waiting period. To avoid this high rate of recurrence, we instituted an aggressive program of CT scan evaluation and surgical therapy for all \"stroke patients\" with negative CT scans. Two hundred forty-five patients were seen with a persistent neurologic deficit between July 1980 and December 1983. These patients underwent CT scans 1 and 5 days after the initial event. Of these 245 patients, 171 patients (70%) were found to have negative CT scans. Appropriate carotid lesions were found by arteriography in 110 (64%) of the negative CT scan group. There were 61 (55%) men and 49 (45%) women in this group. Eighty-five patients (77%) had previous neurologic symptoms or a cerebrovascular accident. Hypertension was present in 52% and diabetes mellitus in 30%. All 110 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy within 14 days (mean 10 days) of the initial onset of their neurologic deficit; these were all done with shunt protection. No patient suffered another neurologic deficit in the same territory within 30 days after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The medicated dogs were grouped according to whether the ibuprofen was administered prior to or after graft implantation. The orally medicated dogs were also grouped according to whether the grafts were removed from 30 to 60 days after graft implantation. The grafts were analyzed for the amount of anastomotic initimal hyperplasia, pannus extension, thrombus deposition, and patency. Analysis of the data demonstrated no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment groups or the control group for the variables analyzed. We conclude that ibuprofen neither prevents nor retards the development of NFH. There was a trend toward less thrombus deposition in the animals that received oral ibuprofen preoperatively. There was also a trend toward higher patency in the animals that received ibuprofen prior to graft implantation, which most likely resulted from decreased thrombus and fibrin deposition.",

    "abstract": "Early reports on the excellent hemodynamic function and low thromboembolic rates of the Ionescu-Shiley bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valve (BPV) encouraged us to use it as our choice for valve replacement in 2680 patients from 1978 through 1983. Analysis of these patients at 5-year follow-up (mean 21.6 months) demonstrated the following important trends. Despite anticoagulation therapy in 48%, thromboembolism occurred in 88 patients for a linearized rate of 1.87% emboli per patient-year and was not time-related. The highest incidence of thromboembolism was in mitral valve replacement (MVR) (2.76% per patient-year). The actuarial freedom from reoperation resulting from valve failure at 5 years was 82% in aortic valve replacement (AVR), 87.1% in MVR, and 92.6% in AVR/MVR. The most distressing causes for reoperation were valve calcification (33 patients, 0.68% per patient-year) and leaflet disruption (11 patients, 0.23% per patient-year). Valve calcification was related to age, small valve size, and AVR position and increased with time, especially at the 4- to 5-year intervals. In patients under 30 years of age, calcification occurred in 18.7% at a mean time of 40.8 months in AVR and in 8.2% at 44 months in MVR, for an overall rate of 11.6%. Over the age of 30 years, it occurred in 14 patients (0.6%) at a mean time of 44 months. Leaflet disruption was not related to age and occurred later in AVR (50 to 58 months) than MVR (1.5 to 61 months). Events increased with time (mean range 37 to 58 months). Because of calcification and leaflet disruption, valve failure causing reoperation has increased significantly at the 4- to 5-year intervals even when valve replacement in patients under 30 years of age is excluded. If this trend continues, the valve failure rate will be exceedingly high on further follow-up. Thus we have limited the use of the BPV to a selected group of patients in whom valve longevity is less important than effective orifice size, thromboembolic rate, and freedom from anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "Thrombolytic therapy effectively interrupts acute myocardial infarction but does not correct the underlying plaque causing acute thrombosis. Early operation and treatment of the residual coronary artery disease has therefore been evaluated. Over 29 months, 184 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than 6 hours duration were treated with intracoronary (IC) or intravenous (IV) streptokinase (SK). Angiography was performed early and thrombolysis found to be successful in 70% of the IC-SK group and 82% of the IV-SK group. One hundred six patients with successful thrombolysis had early revascularization surgery performed 3.3 +/- 2.1 days following SK treatment (range 0 to 11 days). These patients were compared with 110 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting for standard indications. The SK group had an average of 3.0 +/- 1.4 grafts, 4.3 +/- 3.1 units of blood, and 10.8 +/- 5.3 days in the hospital postoperatively per patient and had an operative mortality rate of 2.7%. The control group averaged 3.6 +/- 1.3 grafts, 4.0 +/- 2.4 units of blood, and 9.6 +/- 3.5 days in the hospital postoperatively per patient with an operative mortality rate of 2.7%. This experience indicates that early operation following SK therapy can be performed with low operative risk and without prolonged hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive revascularization of the ischemic lower extremity in atherosclerotic occlusive disease by femoropopliteal (FP) and femorotibial (FT) bypass or profundaplasty (P), as indicated, has been advocated by some authors for all patients. Others have recommended primary amputation, particularly for tibial occlusive disease. To clarify this clinical dilemma, we reviewed the results of 547 procedures performed during the last 5 years: revascularization in 375 (69%) instances and below-knee amputation (BKA) in 172 (31%) cases. Bypass procedures were used in 246 cases: FP in 155 (64%) and FT in 91 (37%). Reversed autogenous saphenous vein (ASV) was used preferentially in 125 (51%) cases, whereas polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was used in 121 (49%) cases. P was performed in 129 instances accompanied by inflow procedures in 92 (71%) of these cases. Cumulative limb salvage (LS) exceeded bypass patency in all categories and resulted in 2- and 5-year LS rates of 83% and 81% for FP with the use of ASV and 52% and 35% for PTFE. The LS rate for FT was 53% and 47%, respectively, for ASV and 20% and 15% for PTFE. Rest pain was successfully relieved by P in 99 cases (77%), whereas healing occurred in only 51% of cases with tissue loss. The perioperative mortality rate for revascularization was 3%; 42% of the group died during follow-up, death usually resulting from complications of atherosclerosis. Of the 172 BKAs, primary healing occurred in 80%, but the perioperative mortality rate was 13%. FP and FT bypasses are preferred procedures if ASV is available, whereas use of PTFE should be limited to FP bypasses only. Rest pain is relieved by P but tissue loss should prompt consideration for bypass. BKA should be considered in cases of severe tibial disease only in the absence of a suitable ASV, as the perioperative mortality rate is high and ultimate rehabilitation (64%) is limited.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative fluctuation of blood pressure and the use of anticoagulants during carotid endarterectomy may potentiate lethal aneurysm rupture in patients who have symptomatic extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease with incidental, asymptomatic, intracranial berry aneurysms. Ten patients having this combination are described in the present study. Of five men and five women whose mean age was 63 years, nine had symptomatic carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis, one had internal carotid fibromuscular dysplasia, and all had intracranial berry aneurysms ranging from 2 to 13 mm in diameter (mean diameter 6.6 mm). In seven patients, aneurysms were greater than or equal to 6 mm in diameter. Hypertension was present in seven patients and moderately severe in five. Three of the aneurysms were located in the intracranial internal carotid artery, five in the middle cerebral artery, three in the posterior communicating artery, one in the anterior cerebral artery, and one in the superior cerebellar artery. Twelve carotid reconstructive procedures were performed without morbidity related to aneurysm rupture. These included 10 carotid endarterectomies, one of which was combined with Dacron patch angioplasty and one of which was combined with a simultaneous coronary artery bypass; one carotid artery dilatation for fibromuscular disease; and one reoperative carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty. Three patients had correction of hemodynamically significant lesions, two of which were proximal to ipsilateral anterior circulation aneurysms. An intraluminal shunt and heparin anticoagulation therapy were used in all patients. Despite a concerted effort to control blood pressure, the patients' perioperative blood pressures ranged from 60/30 to 240/110 mm Hg. Three patients had subsequent elective clipping of intracranial aneurysms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Symptoms associated with subclavian artery stenosis are related to reduced cerebral or arm blood flow. A large difference in blood pressure between the two arms is associated with symptoms of arm ischemia alone and is usually caused by an anatomic variant. The presence or absence of a radiologic steal alone did not seem to determine the type or presence of symptoms. The type of cerebral symptoms seems to be determined by the location of other extracranial vascular stenosis. In patients with hemispheric symptoms there was a higher incidence of anterior circulation insufficiency and a greater reduction in the overall cerebral blood flow. In patients with nonhemispheric symptoms a higher incidence of posterior circulation insufficiency occurred. There may be a small group with nonhemispheric symptoms and a subclavian artery stenosis in whom reversed vertebral artery blood flow is the sole determinant. Perhaps more accurate delineation of other extracranial vascular stenosis would help determine what stenosis in addition to the subclavian artery occlusive disease determines the presenting symptoms. Surgical repair of these lesions may lead to an improved cure rate in this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "Seventy-two secondary operations for complications of prior renal artery reconstructive surgery were undertaken in 58 patients. This experience evolved from the management of 373 patients who underwent 425 primary operations for renovascular hypertension. Secondary operations were performed 10 times in pediatric patients following 42 primary procedures (24%); 44 times in adult fibrodysplastic patients following 199 initial operations (22%); and 18 times in atherosclerotic patients after 184 primary operations (10%). The overall reoperation rate was 15.5% (58 of 373 patients). Reoperation typically followed persistent or recurrent hypertension caused by graft thromboses, perianastomotic graft narrowing, or progressive nonanastomotic graft stenoses. Aneurysmal deterioration of vein grafts was an uncommon reason for reoperation. Secondary reconstructions included nephrectomy (31), bypass with vein grafts (15) or prosthetic grafts (8), angioplasty or reimplantation (12), thrombectomy (4), and operative dilation (2). Benefits regarding hypertension control were afforded 91% of these patients. One death occurred among the 72 reoperations, representing a 1.4% operative mortality rate. Reoperative renal artery reconstructive surgery for complications of renal revascularization may present formidable technical problems. Early diagnosis and prompt reoperation with exacting vascular surgical techniques are most likely to provide optimal results.",

    "abstract": "Between 1970 and 1982, 50 patients (38 male and 12 female) underwent revascularization of 51 occluded renal arteries. Ages ranged from 8 to 71 years (mean 54.6 years). Occlusion was caused by atherosclerosis in 43 patients, fibromuscular dysplasia in three, chronic dissection in two, abdominal aortic coarctation in one, and neurofibromatosis in one. Contralateral renal artery occlusive disease occurred in 22 patients. Extrarenal atherosclerosis occurred in 44 patients. Mean preoperative serum creatinine level ranged from 0.5 to 8.4 mg/dl (mean 1.9 mg/dl). No patient required preoperative dialysis. Length of the involved kidney ranged from 8.4 to 14.5 cm (mean 11.5 cm). Indication for renal revascularization was hypertension in 49 patients and preservation of renal function in one. Renal artery bypass was performed in 36 patients, renal artery endarterectomy in six, transaortic endarterectomy in five, and reimplantation of the renal artery in three. Simultaneous revascularization of the contralateral renal artery was performed in 20 patients. There were three operative deaths. At hospital dismissal, hypertension had improved in 45 of 46 patients. Follow-up periods ranged from 4 months to 12 years (mean 50.2 months). Thirty-four patients remained normotensive, five still had less hypertension, and seven became worse. These data demonstrate that revascularization of an occluded renal artery can be effective in controlling hypertension and that this effect is durable in the majority of patients.",

    "abstract": "Although unusual, innominate artery lesions may present challenging problems. To classify the wide spectrum of problems requiring operation and elucidate certain principles of management, a series of 71 patients undergoing operation for innominate artery problems over a 20-year period was reviewed retrospectively. Occlusive disease (37 patients) was most common, usually presenting with neurologic or ocular symptoms. Other lesions included innominate aneurysm (three), aortic dissection involving the innominate artery (three), traumatic injuries (five), tracheoinnominate fistula (10), anomalous origin or tortuosity causing tracheal compression (six), involvement in mediastinal tumor or scar (six), and thromboembolus (one). The type of operative repair and mortality rate varied with the nature of the lesion. Overall 38 patients underwent transsternal repair, whereas 12 had extrathoracic bypass, 16 resection and oversewing, and five a pexy procedure. For occlusive disease, direct repair via median sternotomy gave best long-term results with an acceptable mortality rate (3.4%). Shunting was not required. Extrathoracic grafting proved safe but less durable and should be reserved for high-risk patients or special circumstances.",

    "abstract": "No experimental data have been published that evaluate the role of lower extremity lymphatics in the pathophysiology of arterial graft infection. Bilateral interpositional femoral artery graft (PTFE) replacements were performed in 21 greyhounds, accompanied by unilateral limb ischemia-rendering operations and ipsilateral bacterial inoculations with standardized inocula of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Inguinal lymphatics in the ischemic leg were either simply transected (group I), carefully preserved (group II), or excised and ligated (group III) at the time of femoral graft implantation. The grafts were harvested 48 hours later and graft and blood cultures obtained. There was an 87.5% incidence of positive graft cultures in groups I and II, but both organisms were cultured significantly more often in group II than in group I (62.5% vs. 12.5%; p less than 0.01). Blood culture data were similar. The incidence of positive graft and blood cultures in group III was only 20%, and no cultures obtained were positive for both organisms. Cultures of contralateral control grafts yielded both organisms in all group II dogs compared with only 25% of group I and 0% in group III (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the lymphatics probably contribute to the development of acute graft infection by absorbing bacteria, and either transporting them to the systemic circulation via lymphatic-venous communications when the lymphatics are intact, causing hematogenous contamination of a graft, or by directly bathing the implanted graft when the lymphatics are disrupted proximal to a septic focus. Careful isolation, transection, and ligation of the inguinal lymphatics at the time of arterial reconstruction might minimize acute graft sepsis.",

    "abstract": "The true incidence of recurrent disease after carotid endarterectomy (CENDX) is unknown, but noninvasive hemodynamic testing shows a paradox between the incidence of hemodynamically significant recurrent stenosis (RS) and the presence of symptomatic disease. We have shown that real-time B-mode ultrasound imaging can demonstrate the gross pathology of the arterial wall and plaque and their surface characteristics. Therefore we reviewed the clinical data and B-mode studies performed 6 months to 15 years after 276 carotid endarterectomies. Preoperative and perioperative risk factors and associated symptoms on follow-up were stored on computer. The patients were divided into three groups by the anatomy of their B-mode study. The majority of the studies were normal (203 [73.5%]), 42 (15.2%) showed mild disease, and 34 (12.3%) demonstrated significant RS. The RS group had a statistically significant increase in incidence of known lipid abnormalities (p less than 0.05), associated peripheral vascular disease, previous myocardial infarctions, and ulcerated plaque on the original carotid endarterectomy (p less than 0.01). The site of RS appeared related to the time of detection by B-mode ultrasound imaging. Internal carotid RS developed late (greater than 4 years), as did RS of the bifurcation. By contrast, stenosis at the common carotid level developed earlier. These findings suggest different pathogenic mechanisms--for the former, redevelopment of atherosclerosis; for the latter, accentuation of preexisting atherosclerosis perhaps by hemodynamic factors. Finally, in the 26 vessels with RS without occlusion, there was an 8% incidence of plaque ulcer or hemorrhage vs. a 62% incidence in 79 primary atherosclerotic plaques previously studied by both B-mode and pathologic examination. The low incidence of plaque characteristics associated with symptomatic disease may account for the low incidence of symptomatic disease associated with RS.",

    "abstract": "Eighty-one patients suspected of having cerebrovascular disease had 157 carotid arterial systems studied by both duplex ultrasonography and contrast arteriography to better define the role of carotid duplex scanning in the surgical decision-making process. These studies were reviewed in a blinded fashion in conjunction with history and physical examination data by two surgeons, one operating on only symptomatic lesions, the other operating on both symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions. Results were analyzed to ascertain if there was agreement regarding decisions for carotid endarterectomy based on scan findings compared with decisions based on arteriographic findings. Scans were also compared with arteriograms and data were analyzed by decision matrix analysis. The accuracy of duplex scanning in relation to arteriography was 81% for detection of disease, 90% for the detection of ulceration, 83% for the detection of a critical stenosis, and 99% for the detection of total arterial occlusion. There was agreement between the two studies regarding the need for carotid surgery in 91% and 89% of carotid arteries, according to surgeons A and B, respectively. Regardless of the surgeons' indications for carotid endarterectomy, duplex ultrasonography provides sufficient information for proper surgical decision making in a high percentage of patients. The accuracy of duplex scanning and the risks of contrast arteriography suggest a possible future role for the routine use of duplex ultrasonography with selective utilization of arteriography in the surgical decision-making process in patients being evaluated for cerebrovascular occlusive disease.",

From 1981 through 1983, 74 patients underwent 55 femoral-tibial and 23 femoral-popliteal in situ saphenous vein bypasses. The operative indications were threatened limb loss in 76 (97%) and disabling claudication in 2 (3%); 35 of 74 patients (48%) were diabetic. In the last year pulsed Doppler spectrum analysis was added to arteriography for intraoperative graft assessment. For 55 femoral-tibial grafts measured by life-table patency rates at 30 days, only one femoral-popliteal graft failed (1 1/2 years). Complete vein utilization was accomplished in 91% of the bypasses attempted. In 41 of the 78 (51%) grafts, vein diameter was 3.5 mm or less. Operative time decreased with experience. Pulsed Doppler spectral analysis has proved useful for intraoperative graft evaluation. The in situ saphenous vein has become the conduit of choice for infrageniculate bypass.",

    "abstract": "This report concerns 30 patients with the acute form of \"inflammatory aneurysm\" of the aorta treated during a 27-year period between April 1957 and March 1984. There were 28 men and two women whose ages ranged from 46 to 78 years (most over 60 years). All were heavy smokers. The aneurysmal disease was located below the renal arteries and the inflammatory changes were limited to the abdomen in 24 patients; one patient had a ruptured aneurysm. The aneurysm involved the entire abdominal aorta in one, the descending thoracic and infrarenal abdominal aorta in two, and the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta in continuity in three patients. The inflammatory changes occurred grossly and microscopically in both abdominal and thoracic aortic segments in five of the latter six patients. The changes were manifested by anterior and lateral mural inflammatory thickening contiguous with similar changes of the retroperitoneum and mediastinum that produced varying degrees of ureteral obstruction in seven patients. Most had abdominal, back, or flank pain and abdominal tenderness, suggesting rupture or leakage. Emergency exploratory operation had been performed elsewhere in 10 patients. Operation was abandoned because of exposure difficulties, bowel perforation, or visceral arterial involvement. Diagnosis was suggested by CT scan in 10, ultrasonography in one, and excretory urograms in seven patients. Treatment consisted of thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in six and infrarenal aortic replacement in 24. The aorta was clamped at the diaphragm in most of the latter cases to avoid injury to adjacent structures. Nephrectomy or ureterolysis was rarely necessary. Of these 30 patients, 29 were early (30 day) survivors and ureteral obstruction spontaneously subsided in most cases without special treatment. There was one late death at 2 months and eight deaths from 3 to 13 years; 20 (67%) patients are still alive.",

    "abstract": "With increasing technologic advances in interventional radiology, the vascular surgeon should be well versed in the indications, limitations, complications, and results of percutaneous transcatheter embolization for arterial trauma. Three hundred twenty-eight angiographically determined arterial injuries occurred in 242 patients from 1977 to 1984 in a major city hospital trauma center and were studied prospectively. Transcatheter embolizations performed for 107 arterial injuries in 100 patients were successful in 82.2% of injuries. Gelfoam, minicoils, microcoils, intimal dissections, or a combination of modalities was utilized. Anterior and posterior element pelvic fractures associated with hypotension and transfusion of 6 units or more of blood required embolization in 28 patients. Bleeding was controlled in 85.7% of patients. Percutaneous transcatheter embolization was also effective in controlling 84.2% of arteriovenous fistulas, 88.9% of penetrating neck arterial injuries, and 73.3% of postoperative intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Therapeutic transcatheter embolization is a valuable adjunct to the vascular surgeon dealing with the spectrum of vascular trauma.",

    "abstract": "Recent animal and human studies have suggested that positive indium 111-labeled leukocyte scans may help establish the diagnosis of vascular graft infection; however, there is little information available about the predictive value of both positive and negative leukocyte scans in larger groups of patients. In this study 31 indium 111 leukocyte scans were performed prior to definitive treatment in 21 patients with suspected vascular graft infections. Patients with more than one leukocyte scan performed had either anatomically distinct sites of infection or rescanning of a potentially infected site after definitive treatment. Scans were performed according to the method of Baker et al., attaching 500 muCi of indium 111 to leukocytes with imaging 24 hours later. All patients with positive scans underwent surgical exploration of the area of leukocyte accumulation, with documentation of purulence and culture of the graft. Patients with negative scans were treated as if scan results were indeterminate and underwent surgical exploration for usual clinical indications; if no exploration was performed, the patient was followed up closely for at least 1 year. Twelve of 12 positive scans showed purulence or culture evidence of infection with three different organisms; in 15 instances of negative scans, two operations were performed with one infection noted, whereas no patient without surgery has had a graft infection at 10 months follow-up. In addition to localizing graft infections, two scans demonstrated a nonvascular site of infection. Positive scans also helped determine the extent of infection along the graft, allowing better planning of the surgical procedure. These results indicate that indium 111-labeled leukocyte scans help document and localize prosthetic vascular graft infections.",

Magnetic resonance imaging has particular advantages in evaluating cardiovascular disease: it is noninvasive; it can estimate blood flow velocity; it does not require contrast medium; and it can image in several planes. The major current limitations are resolution and cost. There are also patient-specific limitations involving implanted metal, pacemakers, metallic life support systems, and involuntary motion. NMR spectroscopy allows on-line analysis of important biochemical processes. 31P spectroscopy allows analysis of high-energy phosphate metabolism and is being used to study the effects of and recovery from ischemic cell injury. 13C can be used to monitor metabolism of carbon-containing compounds.

    "abstract": "This article describes our initial experience with intraoperative infusion of the fibrinolytic agent streptokinase. Five patients with various complications of atherosclerosis manifested by limb-threatening ischemia were treated by balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy followed by intra-arterial streptokinase infusion. In each patient viability of the involved extremity was questionable after removal of all thrombus accessible to the balloon catheter. Fibrinolytic therapy was used when operative arteriography showed residual thrombus distal to the popliteal artery. All patients were systemically heparinized during the operation, and three patients were maintained on anticoagulants during the initial postoperative period. A streptokinase solution containing 750 U/ml was infused intra-arterially proximal to the residual thrombus. The total dosage ranged from 20,000 to 100,000 units per patient. This treatment was considered successful in all five patients, as documented by return of palpable pulses, audible Doppler flow signals where none was present prior to infusion, and operative arteriography. There were no complications related to intraoperative streptokinase infusion. We conclude that intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy is a safe adjunct to catheter thromboembolectomy. The observed improvement in limb perfusion can be attributed to lysis of thrombus in the distal arteries that could not be retrieved with the balloon catheter. Laboratory studies are in progress to establish precise indications for intraoperative streptokinase and to determine the most effective dosage and rate of administration.",

During an interval in which carotid endarterectomy was performed in over 1500 patients at The Cleveland Clinic, only six patients underwent surgical management of cervical carotid aneurysms. Aneurysm resection was performed in conjunction with reanastomosis of the internal carotid artery in two patients but required saphenous vein interposition grafts in four others. A temporary carotid shunt was employed routinely and was threaded through the harvested vein before its insertion whenever graft replacement was necessary. Although one vein graft required revision because of early thrombosis, no operative deaths or permanent strokes occurred in this small series. Each patient has remained asymptomatic throughout a maximum follow-up period of 6 years postoperatively.",

The two patients described herein had no clinical or angiographic evidence of cerebrovascular aneurysm formation. Light and electron microscopic histologic studies revealed complete focal absence of the arterial media in the region of aneurysm formation. No clinical or laboratory evidence of associated collagen-vascular disease was demonstrated. The patients were successfully managed with segmental resection and grafting of symptomatic, expanding, or large aneurysms. The necessity for an aggressive search for associated aneurysms as well as the need for long-term follow-up when histologic evidence of medial agenesis is demonstrated in association with arterial aneurysm formation are emphasized.",

    "abstract": "This article compares the accuracy of commonly used oculoplethysmography (OPG) equipments--OPG/Gee, OPG/Kartchner, and OPG/Zira--in the detection of significant carotid stenosis. The first 200 patients (400 carotid arteries) with readily available carotid arteriograms were selected from each of the following categories: OPG/Kartchner, OPG/Gee, and OPG/Zira, making a total of 600 patients. The radiologic findings were divided into two categories: the first included patients with normal carotid arteries or vessels with less than 50% stenosis, and the second included patients with carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50%. The results of OPG/Zira, OPG/Kartchner, and OPG/Gee are listed respectively: diagnostic sensitivity of 88.88%, 92.6%, and 96.0%; diagnostic specificity of 86.77%, 90.7%, and 91.8%; false positive rate of 6.0%, 5.1%, and 3.6%; false negative rate of 22.7%, 13.0%, and 8.9%; overall diagnostic accuracy of 88.25%, 92.0%, and 94.8%; and accuracy in determining bilateral carotid stenosis of 66.0%, 79.0%, and 89.5%. We concluded that the three machines were valuable in the diagnosis of normal carotid arteries and significant unilateral carotid stenosis. However, the OPG/Gee had slightly better overall accuracy and was more valuable in the diagnosis of significant bilateral carotid stenosis. The OPG/Kartchner had the advantage of being applicable in patients with extreme hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. The OPG/Zira was limited in the diagnosis of bilaterally significant carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "The axillary-femoral bypass graft is an alternative to direct anatomic procedures for patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. Touted for its low morbidity and mortality rates, with corresponding improved patency rates, this extra-anatomic procedure has been considered safe and effective. Noncompromising upper extremity ischemia and one case of upper extremity loss, associated with early graft thrombosis, have been reported previously. This article describes two cases of late axillary artery thrombosis, occurring 4 and 6 months after graft thrombosis, which severely jeopardized the viability of the ipsilateral upper extremity. Experience with these patients has shown that a thrombosed axillary-femoral bypass graft may jeopardize the viability of the ipsilateral upper extremity many months after its failure. The absence of information in the literature regarding this complication suggests this is a rare complication of thrombosed axillary-femoral grafts.",

    "abstract": "We have used a dye-flow visualization technique to analyze the substructure of flow separation in a plastic model of the human carotid bifurcation under steady and pulsatile flow. Under steady conditions at a physiologic flow split (Q external carotid/Q common carotid = 0.30) and Reynolds number (500), a large region of separated fluid developed along the outside wall of the sinus, opposite the flow divider. Yellow dye injected into the boundary layer upstream from the bifurcation traveled slowly along the wall of the common carotid and entered directly into the separation. Blue dye injected into the central, high-velocity streamlines in the common carotid impacted on the flow divider, then traveled circumferentially and entered the separation. Mixing of these two sources was documented by the appearance of green fluid, which lingered in the region of separation. Pulsatile flow resulted in a smaller region of separation; mixing still occurred. Flow separation at the carotid bifurcation is a site of mixing of fluids previously subjected to prolonged low-shear wall contact and brief high-shear wall contact. Separation is itself a site of low shear, but this study reveals a mechanism whereby low and high shear may act independently or synergistically to explain the link between flow separation and atherogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Dacron prostheses with differing degrees of inner wall filamentousness were implanted in the canine descending thoracic aorta for 56 days (n = 14) and the carotid arteries for 21 days (n = 40). In the thoracic aorta the healed inner capsule of 8 mm internal velour grafts was approximately three times as thick as the inner capsule of external velour knitted prostheses. However, the early patency and rapidity of healing of these two types of prostheses were essentially the same. In the carotid arteries the patency of the 4 mm external velour prostheses was greater than that of the internal velour prostheses and the mean thrombus-free surface area of the external velour grafts was significantly greater than that of the internal velour grafts. These observations suggest that an internal velour surface is not deleterious to early patency in a large-caliber, high-flow artery but that it may be in a small-caliber, low-flow artery.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy has been advocated to prevent further neurologic deterioration in patients who have had a stroke. Previous reports have shown that endarterectomy within 2 weeks of a stroke is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates presumably from hemorrhagic complications in the brain. Some recommend a 2- to 6-week waiting period after a stroke, but the safety of operation in the interval of time beyond 2 weeks has not been documented in the literature. The present study investigated the morbidity and mortality rates of 352 consecutive carotid endarterectomies. Three hundred three endarterectomies were performed on patients with symptoms other than stroke. Forty-nine endarterectomies were performed on patients with a deficit lasting more than 24 hours. Of these, 27 carotid endarterectomies were performed in an interval less than 5 weeks after initial stroke (early interval) and 22 operations were performed in a 5- to 20-week interval after stroke (late interval). Five strokes occurred in the 27 patients operated on within 5 weeks, an incidence of 18.5%; none of the patients operated on after 5 weeks exhibited worsening of their preoperative neurologic status. With the use of Fisher's exact test to compare these two intervals, the results were found to be significant (p less than 0.05). The cause of stroke in those operated on in the early interval was investigated by postoperative CT scans; in only one instance was there a hemorrhagic infarct of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The literature suggests that a variety of intracerebral vascular changes render the brain more susceptible to reinfarction soon after stroke. This study suggests an unstable situation in the 5-week interval following stroke that contraindicates carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "As experience with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) increases, both its advantages and disadvantages have become more evident. Although the intravenous approach (IV-DSA) is safer and less expensive than conventional arteriography, images are frequently suboptimal. Good-quality IV-DSAs quite accurately detect hemodynamically significant lesions (sensitivity 92% and specificity 92%) but may overlook minor stenoses and wall irregularities (negative predictive value 69%). When fine detail is not required, IV-DSA may serve as the definitive radiographic examination. The intra-arterial approach (IA-DSA), which provides better images, uses less contrast medium, decreases the need for selective catheterization, and permits visualization of vessels in areas of sluggish flow, is being used more extensively. Careful consideration of the complementary roles of DSA, conventional arteriography, and noninvasive testing is necessary to provide accurate diagnostic information at the least hazard and expense to the patient.",

    "abstract": "Digitized intravenous angiography (DIVA) is a frequently used alternative to conventional intra-arterial angiography for the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease. In an attempt to identify factors that may increase the diagnostic capacity of DIVA, a retrospective study of 58 patients evaluated by DIVA for cerebrovascular disease was performed. The reason for the DIVA study was the presence of focal symptoms in 25 patients and nonfocal or vertebrobasilar symptoms in nine. Twenty-four patients were asymptomatic. DIVA was found to be adequately diagnostic in 37 patients (64%), and further evaluation was required in 21 (36%). When the 42 patients who had ocular pneumoplethysmography (OPG-Gee) results available were classified according to their presenting symptoms, 85% of those with focal symptoms and positive OPG-Gee had a diagnostically successful DIVA study. A high DIVA accuracy rate was also obtained in the asymptomatic patients, whether the OPG-Gee results were positive (60%) or negative (78%). The category of patients for whom the DIVA was the least successful was the group with nonfocal or vertebrobasilar symptoms. As many as 56% of these patients required additional testing. Thus it appears that the yield of diagnostic DIVA is increased when the clinical presentation and noninvasive testing are considered. A prospective study is underway to further verify this hypothesis.",

Of 141 femorotibial bypasses, 60 closed in 0 to 12 months, with 46 closing early (less than 1 month). Early failure occurred in 19 of 52 limbs (37%) with pre-ABPI less than 0.2 and 17 of 89 limbs (19%) with pre-ABPI greater than 0.2 (p less than 0.025). Similar significant differences in early patency occurred between limbs with pre-APVR less than 5 and greater than 5 mm (29 of 94 [34%] vs. 7 of 47 [15%], respectively). Late closure was not predicted by either value. Thus in the 44 limbs with pre-ABPI greater than 0.2 and pre-APVR greater than 5 mm, only 11 grafts closed (25%), whereas if pre-ABPI was less than 0.2 or pre-APVR less than 5 mm, 49 of 97 grafts (51%) occluded within 17 months (p less than 0.025). Postoperative or delta indices had no predictive value. Preoperative ABPI less than 0.2 or APVR less than 5 mm was associated with twice the risk of early femorotibial graft closure; however, cumulative life-table patency was still 39% at 24 months.",

    "abstract": "Pulsed and continuous-wave Doppler examinations with spectral analysis were performed on 258 carotid arteries in 220 patients and compared with multiplane contrast angiography. Each artery was examined for stenosis and assigned to one of four groups: normal to 19%, 20% to 49%, 50% to 99%, and occlusion. The incidence of disease was 70%. Diagnostic sensitivity with all noninvasive techniques varied from 76% to 90% depending on the degree of stenosis, with an overall accuracy rate of 86%. In an attempt to evaluate the diagnostic contribution of spectral analysis, stenosis classification by peak frequency alone was compared with that of the full laboratory profile, including spectral analysis. In the 147 carotid arteries in which such data were available, diagnostic sensitivity was improved with spectral analysis by 8% to 29% depending on the degree of stenosis. Detection of occlusions was unchanged. The major contribution of spectral analysis was in detecting non-flow-limiting stenoses of 20% to 49%. Spectral analysis added little to the diagnostic ability of peak frequency to detect lesions with greater than 50% stenosis. Spectral analysis of either pulsed Doppler or continuous-wave Doppler signals is an accurate noninvasive method for evaluating carotid bifurcation disease, which particularly improves the detection of non-flow-limiting stenoses.",

A review of available information indicates that such therapy may be useful in a small number of carefully selected patients with deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary emboli. The superiority of thrombolytic therapy over conventional surgery for arterial thrombi has not been convincingly demonstrated. Available evidence suggests such therapy should be reserved for those conditions in which surgery may be expected to have a poor outcome or be associated with a high incidence of complications. Preliminary information suggests thrombolytic therapy may be of benefit in selected patients with acute myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive technique that allows the quantification of regional physiologic and biochemical function in vivo. Biochemically active compounds, labeled with positron-emitting isotopes, are administered and the subsequent distribution of radioactivity measured. Although images are produced, they are of secondary importance to the ability to measure cellular metabolic function. The capability of PET to measure regional blood flow, oxygen, and substrate metabolism make it particularly useful in conditions of vascular compromise. Brain and heart have been studied extensively during normal function and while ischemic. PET is able to distinguish ischemic tissue from normal and reversibly from irreversibly injured tissue. PET has been used to document the need for and the metabolic response to vascular surgery. Although PET is complex and expensive, it may offer a means for establishing a more scientific basis for the therapy of vascular disease.",

Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are two materials potentially appropriate for use as small-vessel prostheses. We report the patencies of endothelial cell-seeded and nonseeded 4 mm I.D. Dacron grafts and two designs of nonseeded 4 mm I.D. PTFE (Gore-Tex and Impra) in the carotid position in dogs. All graft lengths exceeded the calculated maximum critical length for the material being tested. Dacron grafts, both endothelial cell-seeded and nonseeded, achieved higher patencies than both designs of PTFE. Endothelial cell-seeded Dacron grafts achieved the highest patencies. Endothelium was present to a significant extent only on endothelial cell-seeded Dacron grafts. There was little pannus ingrowth or midgraft pseudointima on nonseeded Dacron or on patent PTFE grafts although thrombus-free surface areas of patent PTFE grafts were high. These comparative data support the utility of endothelial cell seeding in achieving high patencies of small-diameter vascular grafts.",

    "abstract": "CAD is the leading cause of postoperative and late death following peripheral vascular reconstruction. In an attempt to reduce the eventual incidence of fatal myocardial infarction, preoperative coronary angiography was obtained in a series of 1000 patients under serious consideration for elective vascular procedures at The Cleveland Clinic. Those patients found to have severe, surgically correctable CAD were advised to undergo myocardial revascularization as a combined or preliminary operation. Severe, correctable CAD was discovered in 25% of the study group, including 34% of patients suspected to have CAD by conventional clinical criteria in comparison to only 14% of those who were not (p = 2.0 X 10(-13) ). Although severe CAD also was more common among men, patients more than 60 years of age, and diabetic patients, the clinical cardiac status was the most reliable indication of the yield of coronary angiography. Coronary artery bypass was performed in 216 patients, and the operative mortality rate for 1292 cardiac and vascular procedures was 2.6%. On the basis of this experience, an algorithm was constructed to select peripheral vascular patients for noninvasive cardiac screening or coronary angiography.",

In contrast, 7 of 15 patients with thallium redistribution (ischemia) on pre-operative scanning had perioperative ischemic events, including one death and two acute infarcts. An additional seven patients with positive scans (redistribution) underwent coronary angiography prior to vascular surgery; surgically important two- or three-vessel disease was confirmed in all.

KG effected complete hemostasis in a significantly shorter time than oxidized cellulose and digital pressure in 18-gauge needle holes in PTFE grafts, graft to graft end-to-end anastomoses, and end of graft to side of artery anastomoses.

    "abstract": "The effect of sequential compression of the radial and ulnar artery on finger pulse volume oscillations was recorded by photoplethysmography. The effect of the compression was studied in 25 control subjects and 15 patients with angiographically documented obstructions of the radial or ulnar artery. Under normal conditions a reduction of oscillations by 35% was observed in the first, third, and fifth finger. On the other hand, an obstruction of the radial or ulnar artery results in a significant reduction or even disappearance of oscillations if the unobstructed artery is compressed. It is concluded that this test offers objective evaluation and documentation of the patency condition of the major arteries supplying the hand circulation.",

    "abstract": "The effects of vasopressin, when administered as intravenous bolus injections and infusions, on cardiac output and the distribution of blood flow to the splanchnic vascular beds were studied in six anesthetized rhesus monkeys. Vasopressin as bolus injections caused dose-dependent decreases in superior mesenteric arterial blood flow. However, small reductions in cardiac output were observed only at the highest doses concomitant with increases in systemic arterial pressure. When vasopressin was infused at the highest dose (5 X 10(-2) units kg-1 min-1) for 10 minutes, cardiac output was unaffected; but sustained reductions in superior mesenteric arterial blood flow and increases in arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance were observed. Infusions of vasopressin (5 X 10(-3) units kg-1 min-1) caused significant and sustained reductions in superior mesenteric arterial blood flow and increases in arterial pressure but no measurable effects on cardiac output or total peripheral resistance. However, there was a significant redistribution of blood flow away from the stomach, small and large intestines, spleen, and pancreas toward the liver (hepatic artery), with no statistically significant change in renal blood flow. On the assumption that comparable responses exist among primates, these data support the clinical use of vasopressin to control gastrointestinal hemorrhage and to offer a probably ideal dose and route of administration.",

    "abstract": "With the aim to evaluate acute thrombogenicity, segments of human umbilical vein grafts (Dardik Biograft, Meadox Medicals, Inc., Oakland, N.J.), nonheparinized, heparin-alcohol-treated, or covalently heparinized, were implanted into the carotid arteries of sheep. Autologous carotid arteries were used as control grafts. Flow was restricted to 25 ml/min. Accumulation of autologous 32P-labeled platelets was registered at both anastomotic and midgraft regions for 240 minutes. At the end of the perfusion period, grafts were removed, opened longitudinally, and the thrombus-free surface (TFS) and thrombus weight determined. The ex vivo determinations showed good correlation with results obtained with in vivo registration. In vivo accumulation of platelets was significantly larger in nonheparinized human umbilical vein grafts compared with heparin-alcohol treated grafts. Covalently heparinized grafts showed a tendency toward lower radioactive values, but visual examination after perfusion revealed areas of \"intimal\" damage with thrombotic deposits, probably caused by heparinization procedure. Autologous arteries showed the largest TFS and the smallest thrombi. Platelet accumulation in autologous arteries decreased almost to reference values after an initial rapid increase. In conclusion, heparin-alcohol treatment of human umbilical vein grafts reduces acute thrombogenicity. Although covalent heparin bonding seems to act in the same way, the fragility of the graft appears to preclude use of this method. Autologous arteries exhibit excellent antithrombotic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether or not changes in wall shear stress play a determinant role in the induction of hyperplasia of intimal tissue of arterially transplanted vein grafts, we developed two models of canine femoral arteries. Wall shear stress was defined by variation of wall shear stress (tau-variation) in the cardiac cycle, with the use of a newly designed computational flow waveform analyzer. In the group I model autogenous vein grafts were implanted under flow conditions of 79.7 +/- 3.2 ml/min of the normally high flow rate with 33.1 +/- 1.9 dynes/cm2 of low tau-variation. In the group II model grafts were implanted under conditions of 2.9 +/- 1.8 ml/min of low flow rate with 178.8 +/- 11.0 dynes/cm2 of normally high value of tau-variation. The intimal thickness of 259 +/- 36 microns 4 weeks after implantation in group I was statistically significant compared with that of 31 +/- 14 microns in group II (p less than 0.005). Our study revealed that change in wall shear stress and not the rate of blood flow is the essential hemodynamic factor related to intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Previous attempts to line polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prostheses with enzymatically derived endothelial cells have not been as successful as similar work with Dacron grafts because of the failure of such prostheses to develop a satisfactory subendothelium. This article reports our experience with a new, highly porous, unreinforced PTFE prosthesis that appears to circumvent this problem. Segments (4 mm I.D., 10 cm in length) of this new graft were implanted in 41 mongrel dogs as carotid interposition grafts. One graft in each dog was seeded with the dog's own endothelial cells, whereas the contralateral graft was treated in an identical fashion except for the inclusion of endothelium. After a mean period of 7 weeks of implantation, the grafts were harvested, their patencies were noted, the thrombus-free area of their luminal surface was calculated with computerized quantitative planimetry, and graft segments were submitted for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In seven dogs the luminal surface was scraped from each graft and measured quantitatively. Although seeded grafts failed to show a statistically significant increase in patency during the short course of this experiment, a trend in that direction was quite striking. Furthermore, seeded grafts had a significant increase in thrombus-free area on their luminal surface as well as a significant reduction in the volume of luminal thrombus. Histologically, seeded grafts developed a substantial 75 to 100 microns cellular subendothelium beneath a confluent endothelial lining. No endothelial lining was noted in control grafts. We believe that the superior handling characteristics of this new prosthesis and its ability to develop a substantial subendothelium with a confluent endothelial lining suggest potential future applications and warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Mismatch in mechanical properties (compliance mismatch) between host artery and prosthetic graft has been suggested as a cause of graft failure, but no mechanism linking the two has been identified. With the use of a simplified model based on isocompliant arterial grafts, pulsed ultrasound was used to generate detailed longitudinal profiles of diameter and compliance near the anastomoses. These longitudinal profiles revealed that although arterial diameter decreases monotonically to a minimal level at an anastomosis, arterial compliance first increases by approximately 50% before decreasing to 60% of the control value. This para-anastomotic hypercompliant zone (PHZ) is centered 3.6 mm from the anastomosis. PHZ also occurs in the artery adjacent to compliant or stiff grafts and is probably caused by transmitted effects of the suture line on the arterial wall. PHZ adds to any mismatch in compliance that already exists between artery and graft and can produce a compliance mismatch even between an artery and a nominally isocompliant prosthetic graft. It is hypothesized that PHZ, a region of increased cyclic stretch, promotes subintimal hyperplasia near anastomoses and may thus be a link between the mechanical properties of arteries and the failure of bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "Oculopneumoplethysmography (OPG-Gee) was performed pre- and postoperatively in 100 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and 14 patients undergoing nonendarterectomy procedures (aortofemoral or carotid-subclavian bypass). Absolute differences in ocular systolic pressure (OSP) were determined and results were compared with previous criteria. Twelve examinations yielded abnormal findings in the endarterectomy group. Seven patients had associated neurologic deficits and six had occlusion confirmed at reexploration. Five patients were without symptoms; two with profound depressions in OSP were reexplored and thrombosis confirmed whereas three with moderate (15 to 30 mm Hg) depressions in OSP were followed up and remained asymptomatic. Values of OSP were related to the status of the contralateral carotid artery. In the nonendarterectomized patients OSP did not change with general anesthesia or carotid clamping. OPG-Gee is a useful test to screen for postoperative carotid thrombosis. It helps select symptomatic patients with occlusions who might benefit from early reexploration. In asymptomatic patients a profound drop in OSP identifies early occlusion and may be used alone or in concert with angiography to select patients for reoperation.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed the results, systemic effects, and complications associated with the selective infusion of low-dose streptokinase in 151 patients. Successful thrombus lysis was achieved in 78% of atherosclerotic thrombotic occlusions less than 30 days old, in 81% of post-procedural occlusions less than 14 days old, and in 87% of patients with thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas no more than 4 days old. During the first 12 hours of treatment 81% to 84% of patients had greater than 50% decrease in plasma fibrinogen levels and 100% showed the same decline after 24 hours of treatment. The thrombin time was prolonged to at least 1 1/2 times the control thrombin time in 33% to 42% of patients measured at 4 hours of therapy and in 93% to 97% of patients measured at 24 hours of treatment. Fifteen patients (9.9%) had major complications. Eleven of these had hemorrhagic complications, two had significant distal emboli, one had a thrombosed brachial artery, and one had a false aneurysm at the catheter entry site. We have found that selective low-dose streptokinase is effective in the treatment of acute and chronic thrombotic occlusions and is a useful adjuvant to vascular reconstruction or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Although the local infusion dose is substantially lower than the usual systemic dose, a systemic lytic effect was seen in all patients. Hemorrhagic complications occurred despite customary precautions.",

These patients had significant renal artery stenosis in addition to either severe aortoiliac occlusive disease or aortic aneurysmal disease. Fifty-eight patients were hypertensive, whereas five patients were normotensive and these renal lesions were treated prophylactically. The operative mortality rate was 3%. Despite lack of selectivity in these patients with diffuse atherosclerosis, 60% (35 of 58) of the patients with hypertension could be classified as either \"cured\" or \"improved.\" Patients with bilateral renal artery involvement and moderate azotemia were noted to improve with respect to renal function postoperatively. No patient has required chronic dialysis at a mean follow-up period of 22.6 months. Simultaneous aortic and renal artery surgery may be performed with low morbidity and mortality rates and produce a gratifying improvement in hypertension. Renal functional improvement and perhaps preservation of renal mass may be anticipated in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "In a prospective study of 142 patients receiving intravenous heparin of bovine lung origin, thrombocytopenia developed in nine (6%) patients. In the group of 70 patients with a history of prior heparin therapy, seven (10%) had thrombocytopenia. By contrast, only 2 (3%) of 72 patients with no history of previous heparin treatment had thrombocytopenia, a statistically insignificant difference (p less than 0.5). In this group 58 patients received heparin for less than 10 days, and none of them had thrombocytopenia. Of the remaining 14 patients who were given heparin longer than 10 days, two patients (14%) had thrombocytopenia. This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Monitoring the platelet count detects the disorder early and prompt cessation of heparin prevents serious complications. All patients undergoing heparin therapy should have determination of pretreatment platelet count. In patients with a history of previous heparin therapy, thrombocytopenia may develop even with short duration of heparin treatment, and hence platelet counts should be monitored throughout the duration of treatment. The platelet count of patients who have no history of previous treatment with heparin should be monitored if heparin is continued for more than 7 days.",

The condition should be suspected if ischemia of the leg develops postoperatively when the knee is hyperextended and is improved when the knee joint is flexed. Measurements of the ankle pressure index or Pulse Volume Recorder tracings at the ankle in both flexed and extended positions will confirm the diagnosis. The entrapment of the bypasses in these three patients was easily corrected by transection of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. Relief of the occlusion of the bypass can be easily demonstrated by noninvasive studies.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in elucidating the pathogenesis of aneurysmal disease, the precise etiology of arterial wall degradation remains unclear. Numerous etiologies have been implicated, including stress-strain factors, structural wall abnormalities, and enzyme imbalance. We have previously shown that collagenase and elastase are increased in aortic aneurysm tissue. Herein we report and characterize a newly described serum compound that is able to hydrolyze an artificial elastase substrate but is not elastase. This substance is elevated in patients with atherosclerotic disease and, following aneurysmectomy, its concentration increases by threefold. Examination of the substance reveals that it is bound to lipid and consists of four subunits of molecular weights: 310,000, 62,000, 40,000, and 10,000 daltons. It has characteristics of thiol, carboxyl, and metalloenzymes and is most active at a pH of 7.0 to 8.0. A relationship between this serum compound and aneurysm tissue enzymatic activity is noted. We postulate that this serum compound may be produced by mononuclear cells and released into the serum. Furthermore, monocytes may enter the arterial wall intima and release this substance, resulting in proteolytic arterial wall degradation and subsequent aneurysm formation.",

    "abstract": "From 1977 to 1984, renal autotransplantation was attempted in 16 pediatric and young adult patients with renal artery disease, ranging in age from 10 months to 21 years. Renal revascularization was indicated as treatment for severe hypertension in 15 patients and to prevent rupture of an arterial aneurysm in one patient. The reasons for undertaking renal autotransplantation were branch renal artery disease requiring extracorporeal revascularization (n = 14), abdominal aortic hypoplasia (n = 1), and renal artery disease in a small infant (n = 1). Renal revascularization was successfully accomplished in 14 of 16 patients, including one patient who underwent staged bilateral extracorporeal repairs. Obliteration of the inferior vena cava and iliac veins precluded autotransplantation in one patient and a nephrectomy was done. In one patient extracorporeal ligation of an inaccessible renal arterial branch was accomplished with autotransplantation. Currently all 16 patients are normotensive with excellent renal function. Extracorporeal surgery and autotransplantation have been important additions to the surgical armamentarium for renal artery disease.",

    "abstract": "The results following carotid endarterectomy were prospectively evaluated in 134 patients (145 sides) by repeat ultrasonic duplex scanning and clinical evaluation extending for a period of 4 years. There were 107 men and 27 women in the study group. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.3% and the mortality rate, 0.7%. There were 9 late deaths, of which two were stroke related (1.4%). Focal symptoms occurred in 12 patients on the ipsilateral side, six of which were strokes (one lacunar). The remaining symptoms developed in the presence of moderate degrees of carotid stenosis (less than 50%). There were seven patients who had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) referable to the operated side, but only two of these were associated with a recurrent high-grade stenosis. During follow-up 32 (22%) patients had recurrent high-grade stenosis. Restenosis regressed in seven, giving a persistent rate of 17.1%. The incidence of restenosis was significantly higher in women (p less than 0.01). By life-table analysis, restenosis occurred early, the majority within 24 months. There was no consistent association between the development of symptoms and the occurrence of restenosis. Therefore, it is concluded that there is no justification for reoperation based on the degree of narrowing observed to prevent subsequent TIAs and strokes.",

The pathologic feature is a mucinous cyst located within the adventitia of the artery that expands and secondarily compromises the vessel lumen. Although physiologically quite different, this process is easily mistaken for arteriosclerosis. The clinical history of sudden claudication in a young nonsmoking man, combined with characteristic angiographic features, are important clues to the correct underlying pathology. Treatment generally consists of cyst evacuation or local bypass. This article was prompted by the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty to achieve durable success in controlling this unique type of arterial disease. Subsequent surgical intervention proved satisfactory, lending support to this modality as the treatment of choice.",

Unilateral vertebral operations only were performed in the treatment of bilateral flow-restricting lesions with cerebral hemispheric or brain stem symptoms present or persisting despite widely patent carotid arteries or in the presence of inoperable totally occluded internal carotid vessels. The average follow-up period (9.9 years; the longest was 19 years) revealed an overall survival rate of 71% with a stroke rate of 1.5% per average year of follow-up. Specific operative procedures performed were subclavian-vertebral roof-patch angioplasty with plication of associated vertebral kinks in 102 patients, reimplantation of the end of the proximal vertebral artery into the side of the ipsilateral carotid artery in four patients, carotid-vertebral vein bypass in two patients, and decompression of herniated vertebral arteries between segments of foramina transversaria by unroofing the bony canal. The overall operative mortality rate was 3%. The most common neurologic complications were transient phrenic nerve paralysis and usually mild Horner's syndrome.",

A PTFE graft may become exposed from skin necrosis at an area of repeated puncture for hemodialysis or from wound breakdown at a site of thrombectomy. Removal of an exposed PTFE graft has heretofore been considered inevitable, especially if a suture line is involved, because of the risk of hemorrhage and infection. We describe coverage of an exposed graft by a simple full-thickness skin flap that is locally rotated and report the successful salvage of five fistulas by this technique. Thus the concept that an exposed graft is infected and must be removed may not always be correct.",

    "abstract": "Vascular graft infections in the femoral region that require synchronous revascularization are generally reconstructed with prosthetic grafts via extra-anatomic routes. If in situ revascularization is required, then autologous tissue provides optimal results. A particular challenge in this circumstance is achieving soft tissue coverage of the reconstruction where wide and radical d\u00e9bridement has removed the tissues ordinarily used for this purpose. If muscle flaps are not available or possible, the use of omentum is advocated. The omentum can be easily reached from behind the inguinal ligament and transposed on its bipedicled vascular base for coverage of vital structures in the femoral triangle, thereby obliterating dead space and providing a surface for both temporary and permanent skin coverage. The procedure is quite simple, can be performed rapidly, and should be considered for use in the dire situation that requires soft tissue coverage of exposed vessels in extraperitoneal locations.",

    "abstract": "Fifty-four patients underwent 56 profundaplasties for limb salvage. All had stenosis greater than 50% in diameter of the deep femoral artery and associated superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. After profundaplasty, ischemic ulcers healed in 9 of 17 (53%) patients. Rest pain was relieved in 6 of 19 (32%) and areas of ischemic necrosis healed in 7 of 20 (35%). Cumulative patency of the deep femoral artery was 49% at 3 years but fell to 21% at 5 years, whereas cumulative limb salvage was 49% and 36%, respectively. Eleven of the required 28 amputations were performed in the immediate postoperative period. Profundaplasty was used to lower the amputation level and preserve the knee joint in six patients. The other five early amputations occurred in severely ischemic limbs without distal vessels suitable for bypass. The profundaplasty remained patent in all 19 patients who underwent below-knee amputation and 16 (84%) became ambulatory with a prosthesis. Hemodynamic data provided by determination of the profundapopliteal collateral index predicted limb salvage in 10 of 11 (91%) of limbs when the index value was less than or equal to 0.19. Other clinical criteria, such as preoperative ankle-brachial index and the presence of diabetes mellitus, had no predictive value. Isolated profundaplasty for limb salvage is an effective first procedure for selected patients and provides a reasonable alternative to primary amputation or high-risk distal bypass. When amputation is inevitable, effective perfusion of the profunda femoris artery is essential for preservation of the knee joint and results in a high degree of functional rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "In 1945 Martorell described ischemic leg ulcers in patients with hypertension and suggested that the ischemic necrosis was secondary to hypertensive arteriolar disease. The aim of the study was to examine the minimum vascular resistance in the skin of patients with these ulcers. Twelve control subjects (median age 52 years), eight patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (median age 73 years), and six patients with hypertensive ulcers (median age 74 years) were studied. The minimum vascular resistance (MVR) and skin perfusion pressure (SPP) were determined by an isotope clearance method. Presence and severity of PVD were assessed by ankle/arm pressure ratios. The ulcer patients had a higher ankle/arm pressure ratio than the PVD group (p = 0.026) but had similar SPP (p = 0.47). When compared with the control group they had a similar pressure ratio (p = 0.09) but lower SPP (p = 0.001). The MVR was higher in the ulcer patients than the control subjects (p = 0.005) and the PVD group (p = 0.01). The study shows that patients with hypertensive ulcers have a high vascular resistance. This increase in resistance may interfere with the compensatory relaxation that normally occurs distal to an arterial narrowing, resulting in poor tissue perfusion and subsequent ulcer development.",

    "abstract": "The initial surgical management of neck metastases from head and neck cancer may be complicated if the tumor mass invades the carotid vessels. Acute carotid ligation is associated with a high stroke rate. Consequently preservation of flow to the internal carotid artery is desirable. We will describe two patients in whom preservation of flow was accomplished with the use of a saphenous vein bypass from the axillary artery to the internal carotid artery. The technique is described and has several advantages. First, it preserves flow to the internal carotid artery; second, it allows radical excision of tumor without compromising the margins of resection; and finally, at least one suture line and most of the graft are outside the field of radiation and remote from the wound closure. We believe that this technique is useful in the management of patients with disease that has metastasized to the neck.",

Correlation of data with survival and predictive value of preoperative findings were studied. The mortality rate was 43.2%; there was a 29.2% mortality rate among those surviving the day of surgery. Patient-determined variables associated with deaths included age more than 76 years, hematocrit less than 30% and acute abnormality detected by ECG at admission, and suprarenal extension or free rupture of the AAA. Survival could be predicted with only 70% accuracy with a computerized discriminant function based on age and hematocrit and blood pressure values determined at admission. Events following admission associated with death were precipitous fall or persistently low level of preoperative blood pressure, technical complications, and postoperative organ failure. Although the patient's ultimate outcome after ruptured AAA is partly determined before intervention of the physician, efforts to address events resulting in death after admission by improving rapid diagnosis, early resuscitation, and prompt flawless surgery can increase survival.",

    "abstract": "Tibiotibial bypasses were performed with short (8 to 33 cm) segments of reversed autologous vein in 14 patients who did not have longer segments of usable vein. All patients faced imminent amputation unless they had an effective revascularization. Two patients died, one within 1 month of operation. One patient required below-knee amputation despite a patent bypass. Eleven patients (79%) have a patent bypass and a functional limb 6 to 50 months after operation. These good patency results even with several grafts inserted into isolated segments of tibial arteries, some with incomplete plantar arches, suggest that these short vein grafts may be superior to other vein grafts. Tibiotibial bypasses may improve limb salvage results in otherwise difficult circumstances.",

    "abstract": "From 1962 to 1984 splenorenal bypass was performed in 69 patients with renal artery disease caused by either atherosclerosis (n = 54) or fibrous dysplasia (n = 15). Renal revascularization was performed to control hypertension in 27 patients, to preserve renal function in nine patients, and for both of these reasons in 33 patients. The mean follow-up interval is 5.4 years. Postoperatively hypertension was cured or improved in 52 of 60 patients (87%); the serum creatine level was improved or stable in 37 of 42 patients (88%) who underwent revascularization to preserve renal function. Postoperative graft thrombosis (n = 2) or stenosis (n = 3) occurred in five patients (7%). Splenorenal bypass is an excellent method of revascularization of the left renal artery, particularly for patients with a troublesome aorta that precludes performance of an aortorenal bypass.",

These events have been related to the extent of arteriosclerotic lesions in the trifurcation of the popliteal artery (trifurcational disease, TFD) in 368 patients treated consecutively. One hundred fifty-five patients underwent aortoiliac reconstruction, 229 had femorodistal bypass, and 16 underwent both procedures. The median follow-up period was 4.4 years. The mortality rate in male and female patients was increased compared with the expected mortality. This increase was found both in patients with and without TFD. In patients having TFD the mortality was 2.0 times higher than in patients who did not have TFD (p less than 0.001). The difference in the mortality rate persisted after correction for the influence of age, sex, and diabetes mellitus. The higher mortality rate in patients who had TFD was most marked early in the postoperative period and was mainly caused by myocardial infarction. The incidence of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events was significantly increased in patients who had TFD compared with those who did not, particularly in the early postoperative period.",

    "abstract": "To ascertain the relative importance of the factors that influence blood viscosity (VIS), we measured hematocrit (HCT), filterability index, fibrinogen level (FIB), and Ektacytometer indices at osmolarities of both 290 (EI 290) and 200 (EI 200) in 21 diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease (DPVDs) and 11 healthy volunteers (HVs). Stepwise multiple regression analyses generated a formula based on three of the independent variables (FIB, HCT, EI 200) that accurately predicted VIS (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01). Based on the beta coefficients and F statistics, HCT and FIB were the most important elements in the linear regression equation. Compared with HVs the total group of DPVDs had lower HCT (36.5% vs. 42.4%) and higher FIB (661 vs. 276 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) values. When all HVs were compared with a subgroup of DPVDs with similar HCT (n = 10), both FIB and VIS were higher (p less than 0.001) in the DPVD than in the HV group. We conclude that the most important of the multiple factors that influence VIS are HCT and FIB. The finding of increased FIB in DPVDs could have important implications for drug and surgical therapy in this group of patients.",

The 6-year cumulative patency rate is 74% for above-knee and 44% for below-knee cases. Late complications, such as formation of aneurysms in the human umbilical vein graft, occurred in nine grafts, 21/2 to 6 years after implantation. This corresponds to 3.5% of the total number of 257 human umbilical vein grafts. Three of the grafts developed a second aneurysm at a later time, making a total of 12 aneurysms. The aneurysms were evident as a painful, pulsating mass. All patients were operated on, primarily by resection and interposition grafting. All aneurysms were saccular and false. Macroscopic and microscopic examination revealed that all aneurysms except four originated from a gap in the umbilical vein wall and the Dacron mesh. The adjacent graft wall had a completely normal architecture without biodegradation. The cause of the origin of the gap in the wall remains obscure. Four aneurysms were anastomotic and were located at the site of the suture line, placed at the factory, joining the two components of a composite human umbilical vein graft; these anastomotic aneurysms were caused by breaking of the Prolene suture.",

From an initial experience of more than 1000 duplex examinations 78 patients were identified who had independently interpreted carotid arteriograms within 1 month of their duplex study. Duplex and arteriogram reports were then compared on 156 individual carotid arteries. This study demonstrated that duplex scanning can identify hemodynamically significant carotid lesions with a high degree of accuracy. These lesions of greater than 50% diameter reduction were recognized with a sensitivity and specificity of 95%, compared with contrast radiography. We were also able to distinguish carotid occlusion with an accuracy of 93% (10 of 11). These results independently confirm the findings of other investigators and demonstrate the validity of duplex scanning in a community hospital as an accurate noninvasive examination in cerebral vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms arising in an aberrant subclavian artery are rare but constitute a potentially lethal condition that can be treated successfully when appropriately identified. Virtually all patients have a superior mediastinal mass that may be asymptomatic, but usually patients have symptoms of dysphagia, chest pain, or shortness of breath. An accurate diagnosis can now be made noninvasively with computerized tomography. The presence of an aneurysm of an anomalous subclavian artery is an indication for surgical resection. Resection of the aneurysm may be approached through either a right or left thoracotomy. Reestablishment of continuity of flow to the right subclavian artery decreases the risk of ischemia of the extremities and prevents development of the subclavian steal syndrome. Reestablishment of flow to the right subclavian artery is more easily performed through a right thoracotomy incision but this approach limits control of the aorta at a possibly treacherous connection between aorta and aneurysm. In such circumstances a preliminary extra-anatomic reconstitution of flow to the right subclavian artery followed by a left thoracotomy may be preferable. A 67-year-old woman is described who had resection and grafting of an aneurysm in an aberrant right subclavian artery together with a review of the literature and a discussion of problems in the management of patients with this condition.",

    "abstract": "To determine the accuracy of peak Doppler frequency measurements in the diagnosis of extracranial carotid arterial disease and to apply the results to the assessment of the individual patient, 397 studies of continuous-wave Doppler frequency analysis were compared with the results of arteriography. The diagnostic accuracy of the measurement of peak frequency was determined in two ways. First, receiver operator characteristic curves were calculated for different threshold levels of peak frequency. The results showed that the measurement of the peak frequency can be related in only an approximate way to the severity of the arteriographic stenosis because of the uncertainty of the probe-to-vessel angle. Nevertheless, the overall maximum diagnostic accuracy was approximately 91% (Kappa = 0.82 +/- 0.05). Second, likelihood ratios were calculated to take into account the degree of abnormality of the peak frequency measurements. The probability of carotid disease increased as the peak frequency increased, giving likelihood ratio ranges from 0.03 to 25.71. To be able to apply the peak frequency measurements to the assessment of the individual patient in the vascular laboratory, our results were used to construct tables that show the posttest probability of carotid disease based on the clinically estimated pretest probability of disease and the measured peak frequency. It is concluded that the measurement of peak Doppler frequency is an adjunct in the diagnosis of carotid artery disease.",

    "abstract": "From Jan. 1, 1979, to Dec. 31, 1983, 37 patients have undergone simultaneous carotid endarterectomy and myocardial revascularization. There were 27 men and 10 women, and their ages ranged from 45 to 74 years (mean 61.3 years). Unstable angina was present in 61%, significant stenosis in the left main coronary artery in 27%, and either unstable angina or disease of the left main coronary artery in 70% of these patients. All patients had hemodynamically significant stenosis of the carotid artery on the operated side and 14 patients (38%) had bilaterally significant disease; three patients (8%) had a contralateral total occlusion of the carotid artery. There were no deaths resulting from neurologic factors, no permanent, and only one transient (2.7%) neurologic deficits. There were three deaths from cardiac causes (8.1%). Carotid endarterectomy may be performed safely at the time of myocardial revascularization in a patient population with a high incidence of unstable angina and disease of the left main coronary artery. The evolution of and rationale for the combined surgical approach to coexistent carotid and coronary artery disease is discussed and the literature reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The literature contains conflicting reports about the potential value of the processed human umbilical vein graft as an arterial substitute. With a view to a better understanding of the ultimate fate of this device, a series of long-term implantation was undertaken with a nonhuman primate model. Dardik Biografts were implanted as an infrarenal aortic substitute in 13 monkeys. Nine were put to death following complications after post-operative periods ranging from 3 months to 3 years, while four animals remain alive. No calcification or lipid infiltration was found, presumably because the animals were healthy. The patency rate was poor because of complications associated with thrombotic deposits and thinning of the graft wall after implantation, which led to stenosis and fibrous hyperplasia along the anastomoses. The external polyester mesh was found to encourage external tissue proliferation, which could not prevent the graft from dilating since it contained neither elastin nor smooth muscle cells. Because the places where the graft had been damaged before or during processing were the sites of thrombotic accumulation and initial collagen degeneration, it is essential to use only defect-free material. As a consequence the long-term durability of this graft continues to be questioned.",

    "abstract": "In the presence of ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, external carotid artery (ECA) revascularization can improve cerebral perfusion or eliminate an embolic source. From 1974 through 1984, 37 patients at The Cleveland Clinic underwent 42 ECA reconstructions; autologous patch angioplasty and intraluminal shunting were used when feasible. Thirty procedures were limited to primary ECA revascularization, whereas 12 extended procedures were performed as reoperations after previous ECA endarterectomy or required complementary subclavian or intracranial bypass. There were no early postoperative deaths nor neurologic morbidity in the limited group, but one death, four ipsilateral hemispheric strokes, and one retinal embolism occurred in the extended group. Ten patients have died during a follow-up interval of 1 to 72 months (mean 27 months). Five late deaths were caused by myocardial infarction, only one of which was complicated by a contralateral stroke. Two additional strokes have occurred; one involved the ipsilateral and one the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Five other patients experienced recurrent cerebral or ocular ischemic symptoms. In conclusion, extended ECA reconstruction is associated with a higher operative risk than limited revascularization. Late follow-up is necessary to detect those patients who may eventually require additional management of recurrent cerebrovascular symptoms or incidental coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "The preoperative angiogram is widely used to estimate runoff prior to infrainguinal bypass grafting, but the traditional method of angiographic scoring (0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the number of patent tibial vessels) correlates poorly with measurements of peripheral vascular resistance. We assigned a score of 0, 1, or 2 to each of four parameters (anterior and posterior tibial arteries [AT and PT], peroneal artery [PER], and plantar arch [ARCH]) on the preoperative angiograms of 39 patients admitted for elective femoral bypass grafting. These scores were then examined for their ability to correlate with the peripheral vascular resistance measured in each patient at the time of surgery. Multiple linear regression suggested that the scores assigned to the AT, PT, and ARCH were significantly correlated with observed resistance, but the PER subscore was not. Multiple linear regression of the AT, PT, and ARCH subscores suggested that resistance could be predicted from the equation: In (Resistance [mm Hg/ml/min]) = 0.786 - 0.268(AT) - 0.25(PT) - 0.358(ARCH), for which r = 0.78 and p less than 0.001. The ability of this relationship to predict resistance was tested by a division of the patient population into two roughly equal groups based on their observed resistance at surgery. When tested in this fashion, this equation had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 82%. These findings suggest that the preoperative angiogram can be graded in a simple, yet unambiguous way, which allows a reasonable prediction of peripheral vascular resistance.",

    "abstract": "Balloon embolectomy catheters were studied in canine common carotid arteries (2 to 3 mm) in vitro to evaluate a technique of preventing excessive shear forces and to examine the effect of blood within the lumen. Each balloon was studied at 25, 75, 125, or 150 mm Hg lateral wall pressure. Shear forces were recorded in 16 vessels when the balloons were distended before catheter withdrawal, and these data were compared with forces recorded when the balloons were distended during catheter withdrawal. Results showed that distention of the balloon during withdrawal reduced shear forces 43.8% to 55.8% (p less than 0.05). In other experiments shear forces were recorded when the lumen was lubricated with heparinized saline solution, and these were compared with forces recorded when the lumen was lubricated with heparinized whole blood. The presence of blood in the lumen reduced shear forces 23.4% to 52.9% (p less than 0.05). From these studies it is recommended that during embolectomy in patients the balloons be distended during the first half centimeter or centimeter of catheter withdrawal to prevent excessive shear forces and that residual blood in the vessel lumen proximal to the point of embolic obstruction be accepted without concern, provided adequate heparinization has been achieved.",

    "abstract": "We studied the reproducibility of four tests of peripheral occlusive arterial disease in 54 subjects, 32 of whom had this disease. We found that the reproducibility of systolic blood pressures obtained at rest from the thighs, calves, and ankles approximated that of arm systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as did the ankle-to-arm systolic blood pressure ratios. The average of the tenth and ninetieth percentile ranges of the resting systolic blood pressure ankle-to-arm ratios was +/- 0.10. Systolic blood pressures from the fingers were somewhat less reproducible, and those from the toes were even more variable. Systolic blood pressure ankle-to-arm ratios measured after the patient had exercised were less reproducible than resting ratios. The average of the tenth and ninetieth percentile ranges of the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-minute ratios after exercise was -0.13 to +0.16. Skin temperatures from the fingers and toes were approximately as reproducible as systolic blood pressures from the arms and legs and as the resting ankle-to-arm blood pressure ratios. Pulse-volume recordings from the thighs, calves, ankles, feet, toes, and fingers were very poorly reproducible. We conclude that information on the reproducibility of these measurements is essential in the evaluation of noninvasive arterial tests that are used to determine the course of peripheral occlusive arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to assess factors affecting limb salvage after femorodistal bypass in patients with established gangrene. From January 1977 through June 1983, 361 patients underwent infrapopliteal bypasses; 58 patients (59 limbs) had forefoot and/or toe gangrene. There were 33 men and 25 women (mean age 67.6 years), and 40 patients (69%) were diabetic. A total of 71 femorodistal bypass procedures were performed in these patients: a single bypass in 49, repeat procedure in eight, and multiple bypasses in two patients. Graft material was autogenous saphenous vein in 22 cases, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 39 cases, and a composite graft in 10 procedures. After bypass 50 patients underwent limited toe or forefoot amputation with uncomplicated healing. Limb salvage by life-table analysis was 70% at 1 year, 60% at 3 years, and 28% at 5 years. The graft patency at 3 years was 65% for vein grafts and 30% for PTFE grafts. In the entire series the operative mortality rate was 1.7%. Age, sex, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus did not influence the result of surgery. Similarly, failure of a previous femoropopliteal or tibial graft did not reduce the likelihood of limb salvage. Graft patency, however, is prerequisite for limb salvage, and graft patency can be maintained by thrombectomy or repetitive bypass. The present study suggests that limb salvage is possible in as many as two thirds of limbs with established gangrene. Although saphenous vein remains the graft material of choice, its absence should not preclude attempts at limb salvage. Repetitive grafting did not jeopardize patient safety but contributed significantly to extended limb survival.",

Late strokes were most common (p less than or equal to 0.05) among hypertensive patients (31%), those with preoperative strokes (31%), and patients with recognized contralateral carotid stenosis (42%). Contralateral hemispheric strokes occurred in 36% of patients with uncorrected contralateral stenosis compared with 8% of those who had elective bilateral reconstruction (p = 0.09). Myocardial infarctions caused more late deaths (37%) than did strokes (15%), and 10-year survival after incidental myocardial revascularization (55%) was superior (p = 0.0001) to survival for patients with suspected but undocumented coronary disease (32%).",

    "abstract": "Most eye problems referred to vascular surgeons for workup of carotid disease are either transient (amaurosis fugax) or partial (retinal branch artery occlusion) visual loss. Patients with more severe total infarcts of the retina (central retinal artery occlusion) or of the head of the optic nerve (\"ischemic optic neuropathy\") are seldom suspected of carotid disease and, in the latter case, are generally labeled idiopathic. An explanation for the difference in attitude towards these conditions is suggested. A prescribed carotid etiology for these various ischemic syndromes of the eye and optic nerve was explored in a study of 20 consecutive patients who had acute ischemic eye/optic nerve problems. Special visualization of the neck, orbital, and retinal vasculature was obtained. Sixty percent had ipsilateral and 50% had contralateral carotid artery disease. The ophthalmic artery and the posterior ciliary arteries showed intrinsic lesions each in 25% of cases. Our pilot study concludes that there is strong evidence that most of these ischemic eye syndromes are related to carotid artery disease, which is found in the majority of patients. In a minority of them ischemic problems may be due to arteritis or to intrinsic disease of the ophthalmic artery. A more cohesive approach to the study and treatment of these different entities is supported by the suggestion of a common etiology for most of them. Close collaboration with ophthalmologists will be needed to improve the present management of these eye conditions.",

Eight patients were subjected to surgical treatment; no deaths occurred and symptoms were resolved in all patients. A literature review of 108 celiac artery aneurysms revealed two distinct subgroups. Among 60 celiac artery aneurysms encountered before 1950, representing the historic era, 40% were infectious (usually luetic), 7% were traumatic, and 52% were of undetermined cause. Most were symptomatic, 87% ruptured, and 95% were diagnosed at postmortem examination. The contemporary era since 1950 consisted of 48 cases, including nine in the Michigan experience. Congenital or developmental medial defects of the arterial wall and atherosclerosis were the most common causes of aneurysms. Most aneurysms in the contemporary period were either asymptomatic or accompanied by vague abdominal discomfort. Rupture affected 13% of those aneurysms. Operative therapy was successfully undertaken in 91% of 43 patients during the contemporary era, including eight in the present series.",

The embolized discs lodge in the aorta at various levels parallel to the blood stream and have not occluded distal flow. Some embolized discs have been left in the aorta for as long as 12 years. An embolized disc left in the abdominal aorta produced renal artery occlusion 5 years after embolization in the reported case. A previous case produced mesenteric ischemia after 1 month. Localization of embolized discs has at times been difficult with success and failure by plain x-ray films, ultrasound, angiography, and CT scans in some cases. Since embolized discs have not produced acute problems with ischemia, delay of retrieval after emergent mitral valve replacement does not seen detrimental. Late complications may occur as with the present case and removal of asymptomatic embolized discs seems advisable and prudent.",

This investigation was carried out in 34 patients, 27 women and seven men. A total of 68 limbs with varicose veins and 48 control limbs with either no varicose veins or occlusive arterial disease are the basis for the clinical material. Twenty patients had had no prior surgery for their varicose veins and 14 had recurrent varicosities after bilateral ligation and stripping. Five patients had postphlebitic syndrome associated with varicose veins. All five had venous stasis ulcerations and edema. The Doppler flow detector uncovered AV shunting in areas outside the location of known arterial pulsations. The pulsatile venous flow was obtained at sites of \"hot spots\" and along markedly dilated veins. Maximum AV shunting was found in the lower third of the leg but much less often in the upper leg or thigh. The clinical implications of the role of AV shunting are discussed. The Doppler ultrasound findings appear to offer a simpler method to detect AV shunting than serial arteriography or thermography.",

    "abstract": "To determine the correlation between the degree of internal carotid arterial stenosis demonstrated by noninvasive tests and the risk of subsequent stroke, 303 consecutive patients who underwent cerebrovascular evaluation with the Hokanson ultrasonic arteriograph were reviewed retrospectively. Ninety percent of the patients were followed up for 5 years or until the time of death. Stroke occurred in 41 (13.5%) patients. There was a significant correlation (p = 0.04) between the incidence of stroke and severity of disease: greater than or equal to 50% stenosis (19%), 0% to 49% stenosis (11%), and no stenosis (10%). Stroke as a presenting complaint carried the highest risk of subsequent neurologic defect (24%), but the risk in patients without symptoms was appreciable (15%). Life-table analysis indicated that the incidence of stroke was low (less than 3%) in the asymptomatic and nonhemispheric group during the first 2 years after evaluation when the degree of stenosis was less than 50%. Thereafter, the stroke rate increased. Half the deaths were due to myocardial infarction; the risk of death from cardiac causes was doubled in patients with greater than 50% stenosis. It is concluded that the demonstration of hemodynamically significant stenosis does select a group of patients at increased risk for subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction, but lesser degrees of stenosis do not exclude future neurologic events.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the determination of the presenting symptom of patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease, evaluation of these patients may include the noninvasive measurements of ankle/arm pressure ratio, limb blood flow, and treadmill testing to evaluate the severity of the reduction in blood flow. We have included metabolic studies to assess the effect of this reduced blood flow in patients with stable intermittent claudication (n = 20), and with end-stage ischemia (night and rest pain) (n = 11), and in a control group without vascular disease (n = 8). No correlations were found between the resting limb blood flow, ankle/arm pressure ratios, maximum walking distance, and stated walking distance for the patients with stable claudication. Although the oxygen consumption was reduced only in the patients with end-stage ischemia, the percent oxygen extraction was increased to the same level in the patients with stable claudication and those with end-stage ischemia. Intramuscular stores of high-energy phosphates and glycogen were maintained in all groups with the lactate/pyruvate ratio increased only in the patients with end-stage ischemia. The complex interrelationships between the rate and distribution of blood flow with exercise and enzyme adaptation in patients with vascular disease make current resting hemodynamic and metabolic evaluations a poor reflection of the severity of the clinical condition within each patient group. Therefore laboratory testing may offer no advantage over clinical presentation in the overall evaluation of these patients.",

With this protocol of selective conservation it is possible to preserve valuable undamaged major leg veins and at the same time treat varicose veins efficiently. A 3-year postoperative review of 171 patients with 295 affected limbs treated in this way was done by independent observers. They found a recurrence rate of only 10.5%.

    "abstract": "Chronic mesenteric ischemia is uncommon in the atherosclerotic age group but is particularly rare in childhood. Because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms produced and absence of pathognomonic findings by physical examination or by routine laboratory testing, its recognition is difficult and its true incidence is unknown. Four children treated for chronic mesenteric ischemia in our center demonstrated the spectrum of clinical presentations and operative considerations important in the management of this uncommon malady. Ages at presentation ranged from 30 months to 17 years. These presentations ranged from clinically silent ischemia in the 30-month-old child to evolving gastrointestinal infarction in the 17-year-old adolescent. Coexistence of abdominal aortic coarctation and/or renal artery stenoses was present in three of the four children. Successful bowel revascularization was achieved by superior mesenteric artery revascularization alone in three children (reimplantation in two and a bypass in one) and by multiple celiac and superior mesenteric artery bypasses in one. Delayed distal small bowel and proximal colonic resection was required in one child. This experience increases awareness that mesenteric ischemia does occur in childhood and is a rare but potentially lethal cause of abdominal complaints in children. Finally, the finding of both renal and visceral artery disease in three of the four patients underscores the need for adequate evaluation of mesenteric vessels before renovascular procedures are undertaken in this age group.",

    "abstract": "Two hundred seventy-five lower extremity amputations were performed over a 4-year interval for end-stage peripheral vascular disease. Fourteen patients (8.5%) of a total of 165 patients undergoing above-knee amputation (AKA) either suffered acute gangrenous ischemia of the AKA stump postoperatively, or were thought to be at high risk for same, and therefore underwent prophylactic inflow revascularization prior to or concomitant with AKA. The overall operative mortality rate was 28.5% in these 14 patients and was related either to inability to revascularize (two of three patients) or to the attempt to revascularize in the presence of a frankly necrotic amputation stump (three of five patients). Lower extremity amputation may be performed with an overall acceptably low mortality rate, which for our series is 0.9% for 113 below-knee amputation (BKA) and 2.8% for 140 AKA levels. Acute postoperative gangrene of the stump carries a high mortality rate and may be prevented by inflow revascularization prior to amputation. Three situations were identified as carrying a high risk for the subsequent development of gangrene: acute thrombosis of a prior combined inflow/outflow procedure, occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with an occluded/stenotic deep femoral artery and no palpable femoral pulse, and flat pulse volume recordings at the high thigh level. Patients who present for AKA with one of these indications should be considered as a candidate for prophylactic inflow revascularization prior to AKA to prevent ascending gangrene.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous disease of the lower extremities is a clinical entity that is commonly encountered by practicing physicians. The problem is usually a direct consequence of a previous episode of deep venous thrombosis. Patients so afflicted suffer from a distinct series of symptoms that are grouped under the term \"postthrombotic\" or \"postphlebitic\" syndrome. These consist of leg edema, stasis dermatitis, ulceration, and sometimes claudication. The causative pathophysiologic features consist of either valvular incompetence and/or main channel obstruction. This report offers a new method of relieving symptoms caused by a superficial femoral vein obstruction.",

    "abstract": "The operative records of 2816 patients undergoing repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from 1955 to 1985 were reviewed. Inflammatory aortic or iliac aneurysms were present in 127 patients (4.5%), 123 men and four women. Most patients were heavy smokers (92.1%). Clinical evidence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and coronary artery disease was found in 26.6% and 39.4%, respectively. Additional aneurysms occurred in half of the patients; iliac aneurysms were the most common (55 patients), followed by thoracic or thoracoabdominal (17 patients), femoral (16 patients), and popliteal aneurysms (10 patients). Ultrasound and computed tomography suggested the diagnosis in 13.5% and 50%, respectively; angiography was not helpful. Excretory urographic findings of medial ureteral displacement or obstruction suggested the diagnosis in 31.4%. The aneurysm was repaired in 126 patients. Only one patient experienced acute aneurysm rupture, but eight patients had chronic contained leakage. When compared with patients who have ordinary atherosclerotic aneurysms, patients with inflammatory aneurysms are significantly more likely to have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 73% vs. 33%, p less than 0.0001); weight loss (20.5% vs. 10%, p less than 0.05); symptoms (66% vs. 20%, p less than 0.0001); and an increased operative mortality rate (7.9% vs. 2.4%, p less than 0.002). The triad of chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, and elevated ESR in a patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm is highly suggestive of an inflammatory aneurysm and may be beneficial in the preoperative preparation of the patient for aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Although carotid endarterectomy (CE) is recommended in appropriate patients with bifurcation atheroma for the prevention of stroke, these patients are also at risk for visual loss, either temporary or permanent. The presentations of patients undergoing 512 consecutive CEs were reviewed to determine the preoperative frequency and risks of ocular disturbances. Visual symptoms occurred in 131 patients (25%). Temporary, monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax, AF) was reported by 99 patients (19%). Concomitant neurologic symptoms were present in 33 (33%) of the patients with AF, and carotid artery stenoses of greater than 75% diameter were documented in 82 (83%) of these patients. No visual deficits were observed following operation. Permanent visual loss ranging from scotoma to complete blindness was documented in 32 patients (6.2%). The permanent deficits were due to retinal artery occlusions (RAO) in 20 patients (4%), ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) in eight patients (1.5%), and homonymous hemianopsia (HH) in four patients (0.7%). Visual loss occurred without any warning in 27 of these 32 cases (84%). The five cases with warning had multiple episodes of AF and then sustained RAO and blindness. Neurologic symptoms occurred concomitantly but not prior to visual symptoms in 7 of the 12 patients (58%) with ION and HH. Stenoses greater than 75% were present in 22 of 32 cases (69%) and in every case of ION. Operation had no effect on the visual deficit. Permanent visual loss occurred in a significant number of patients with carotid atheroma (6.2%). Warning in the form of visual prodroma is uncommon in these patients (16%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In a previous prospective study of 449 patients undergoing coronary or peripheral arterial reconstruction, 85 patients had preoperative evidence of asymptomatic bruit and/or greater than 50% carotid obstruction by routine Doppler screening. No patient had prophylactic carotid endarterectomy. This article reviews the late postoperative outcome (2 to 61 months, mean 35 months) of 67 patients with asymptomatic carotid disease who survived operation without perioperative deficit. Eleven patients died (16%) including four of myocardial infarction and two of stroke. Neurologic deficits occurred in the late postoperative period in 22 patients (32.8%) after an average interval of 31 months, including transient ischemic attacks in 15 patients (22.4%); only four of these 15 were appropriate to the side of carotid disease documented preoperatively. Seven patients (10.4%) suffered stroke, only three (4.5%) of which were in the territory of carotid disease detected preoperatively. The cumulative rate of carotid disease progression was 34%, including three patients who suffered carotid occlusion. Two of the latter had the only fatal strokes. This study suggests that patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, although not at significant risk of perioperative stroke, require careful follow-up for late postoperative neurologic deficits, the majority of which (68%) are transient ischemic attacks.",

    "abstract": "Venous injury following mechanical distension and its late sequelae were studied in a canine model. Jugular vein segments distended without and with papaverine (60 mg/100 ml) were compared with nondistended vein segments after they had been placed into the arterial circulation for 1 to 12 months. Arteriography showed no significant statistical discrepancy in luminal diameter of the three vein segments. Complete reendothelialization had occurred in all vein grafts at the time of harvesting. Similar histocytologic features existed in the nondistended segments and in the portion distended with human plasma protein fraction (Plasmanate) plus papaverine (150 to 300 mm Hg). The intimal-medial hyperplasia was characterized by an increase in fibrocellular layers with an elaboration of vasa vasorum. Conversely, collagen and extracellular matrix replaced the myocyte, producing medial fibrosis in vein mechanically distended with Plasmanate alone. Papaverine prevented mechanical stimulation of smooth muscle cells to overproduce extracellular connective tissue elements. Mechanical stretching of intimal and medial myocytes induced fibrogenesis and fibroplasia. Papaverine is useful in vein preparation; it protects the endothelium and smooth muscle cells in the intima and media and prevents leukocyte infiltration and medial fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The importance of individualized treatment of patients with primary and secondary axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis is described with special emphasis on the use of thrombolytic therapy. Nine patients were treated with streptokinase or urokinase. Balloon dilation of the axillary or subclavian vein and first rib resection were also selectively used. Of the five patients with primary axillary-subclavian thrombosis, three did not have symptoms after the thrombus was lysed. Two had successful lysis of the thrombus but later suffered a rethrombosis, one of which most likely resulted from an untreated stenosis. All four of the patients with secondary thrombosis had successful thrombolysis. Patients with primary axillary-subclavian thrombosis are usually young and as many as 40% continue to have intermittent upper extremity edema or pain. For this reason we believe aggressive attempts to reestablish normal venous return through the axillary and subclavian veins are warranted. Patients with secondary axillary-subclavian thrombosis usually require prolonged venous catheterization for chemotherapy or total parenteral nutrition. Since patency of major upper extremity veins is extremely important in these patients with secondary thrombosis, we believe that vigorous attempts to restore these venous access routes are indicated and appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Amputation done on an emergency basis of severely ischemic or infected limbs in critically ill patients frequently results in increased morbidity and mortality. To evaluate the effect of delaying an inevitable operative amputation by a simplified method of freezing the involved extremity, the records of 56 patients who underwent preoperative cryoamputation during a 12-year period were reviewed. Data concerning risk factors, associated medical conditions, local or systemic signs of sepsis, level of amputation, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Following cryoamputation of 57 limbs, 16 above-knee amputations (AKA) and 41 below-knee amputations (BKA) were performed. The overall mortality rate associated with cryoamputation was 14% (8 of 57); four postoperative deaths occurred in both the AKA and BKA groups. The mortality rate for 1021 primary operative major amputations during the same period was 7% (p less than 0.04). The only factor identified that significantly affected survival following cryoamputation was diabetes mellitus, which was present in 68% of surviving patients and in 12% of those who died (p less than 0.001). This experience suggests that cryoamputation is a valuable, simple technique that allows for deliberate stabilization and preparation of seriously ill, septic patients prior to surgical procedures, which, when performed on an emergency basis have been associated with mortality rates exceeding 40%.",

During the past 13 months, 10 infrainguinal bypass graft occlusions occurred in nine patients 2 to 48 months postoperatively and were treated with local infusions of either streptokinase or urokinase. The grafts treated included two saphenous vein femoropopliteal grafts, two expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) femoropopliteal grafts, four saphenous vein femoro-anterior tibial grafts, one saphenous vein-PTFE composite femoro-anterior tibial graft, and one saphenous vein-PTFE composite femoroperoneal graft. The graft occlusions occurred 2 to 14 days prior to initiation of treatment. The infusion failed to restore flow completely in seven grafts; and of the three successes, two patients required surgical treatment of complications. All successful recanalizations occurred within 48 hours of the initiation of thrombolytic therapy. Of the seven failures, two patients had viable limbs and were discharged, whereas two required amputation (one above and one below knee). Three patients underwent surgical thrombectomy and revisions that were successful in two and resulted in a below-knee amputation in the other. Despite all precautions, complications occurred in five patients. Low-dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy is a poorly efficacious, risky method of infrainguinal graft occlusion management.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) from sources superior to the right atrium has been documented in several reports, but mechanical device protection has not been advised because of the morbidity associated with occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC). Mechanical protection must maintain caval patency, protect against recurrent PE, and be safe. Since the Greenfield filter has fulfilled these criteria when placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), we tested its suitability for use in the SVC in 11 dogs. Thrombus was harvested from phenolized segments of infrarenal vena cava and embolized into filters positioned in the SVC through the jugular or brachiocephalic vein under fluoroscopic guidance. Central venous pressure (CVP) was monitored before and after embolization. The dogs were allowed to recover and were followed up with monthly vena caval contrast studies and CVP measurements. After 3 months the animals were put to death and autopsies performed to determine the size of any residual thrombus and to examine the pulmonary arteries for signs of PE. Ten dogs had correct placement of the filter in the SVC; there were no perforations and no episodes of PE. CVP rose slightly after embolization into the filter but caval patency was maintained in all animals. Resolution of filter-entrapped thrombi occurred in all animals (mean initial weight = 1.02 gm, mean final weights = 0.11 gm, p less than 0.05). In the eleventh animal the filter was discharged high, with one leg perforating the brachiocephalic vein. No hemorrhage or distal embolism occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell seeding improves patency of small-diameter Dacron grafts and facilitates the development of a complete endothelial flow surface. However, the ideal number of cells relative to the length of graft to be seeded has not been determined. With a canine model previously shown to result in a well-endothelialized graft within 4 to 6 weeks, this study measured the quantity of autogenous endothelial cells labeled with indium 111-oxine that initially adhered to 10 cm long, experimental, porous 4 mm I.D. polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and then calculated their subsequent disappearance following implantation as carotid interposition grafts. Graft radioactivity was monitored with a gamma camera and compared with that of control vials of indium 111 implanted in the same animals. Counts were measured immediately at implantation and for up to 72 hours following restoration of flow. Data were analyzed by linear regression. The mean number of harvested endothelial cells was 6.2 X 10(5). A mean of 19.8% of the harvested cells were adherent to the grafts initially after seeding. In the first 30 minutes following restoration of flow, there was a rapid loss of these cells to a mean value, which was 70.2% of those initially present. From 30 minutes to 24 hours, cell losses continued at a constant rate of 3.7%/hr (r = -0.922, p less than 0.001). Beyond 24 hours, further loss was insignificant. Consequently, approximately 2.72 X 10(4) cells, or only 4.4% of all cells originally harvested, appear adequate to seed 12.5 cm2 of graft.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "A prospective series of carotid endarterectomies were performed with patients given local anesthesia in an attempt to determine the efficacy of intraoperative EEG monitoring and/or stump pressure measurements in predicting the need for carotid shunting. Carotid artery stump pressure was measured and EEG changes noted; however, neither low stump pressure nor EEG changes influenced the decision for shunt insertion. A shunt was only used if a neurologic deficit developed during carotid clamping. A total of 134 carotid endarterectomies were done in 121 patients. Sixty-six patients were men and 55 were women with ages ranging from 41 to 88 years. Indications included transient ischemic attacks in 57 (43%), prior stroke in 25 (19%), vertebrobasilar symptoms in nine (6%), and asymptomatic patients with high-grade stenosis, 43 (32%). Thirteen patients (9.7%) developed neurologic deficits following carotid clamping and had shunts inserted. All deficits cleared following shunt insertion. Nine of the 13 had EEG changes, but in four, EEGs were unchanged despite the occurrence of clear-cut neurologic changes. Stump pressure in the 13 patients ranged from 14 to 78 mm Hg. Ten were greater than 24 mm Hg and three were more than 50 mm Hg. In 121 operations no neurologic deficits occurred during carotid clamping and no shunts were inserted. In 13 of these operations, significant EEG changes were noted. Stump pressures in these 13 with EEG changes ranged from 15 to 120 mm Hg. In seven, stump pressure was greater than 50 mm Hg. There were no deaths in the series. Two (1.5%) temporary and one (0.7%) permanent postoperative deficits occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The computerized registry of The Cleveland Vascular Society includes 19,990 vascular procedures, which have been divided into two groups. Group A consists of 16,731 operations performed on patients younger than 75 years of age and group B consists of 3259 procedures performed on patients older than 75 years of age. The overall operative mortality rate in group A was 4.4% (736 of 16,731). In subsets of group B the mortality rates were: age 75 to 79 years, 11.3% (210 of 1862), age 80 to 84 years, 13.4% (125 of 932), age 85 to 89 years, 18.0% (68 of 376), and age 90 to 98 years, 28.1% (25 of 89). In carotid endarterectomy there were no significant differences in the stroke and operative mortality rates when groups A and B were compared. Group A stroke rate was 1.8% (94 of 5220), operative mortality rate was 1.5% (77 of 5220); group B stroke rate was 2.2% (17 of 782) and the mortality rate was 2.3% (18 of 782).

This article describes an alternative vascular approach to excision of infected dialysis PTFE grafts; success occurred in 14 of 15 excised grafts in 12 patients. The surgical procedure consisted of a 2 to 3 mm oversewn cuff of PTFE left at the arterial anastomosis, with excision of the remaining graft including the venous anastomosis. The entire tunnel tract was opened, debrided, and irrigated extensively with cefazolin solution. Wounds were closed over drains. Fourteen PTFE graft excisions healed without sequelae. This small but successful series of excised, infected PTFE dialysis grafts supports the procedure to leave a small cuff of oversewn PTFE on the artery and to close the wounds primarily over drains.",

    "abstract": "A sterile 8.5 MHz continuous-wave Doppler probe was used intraoperatively to evaluate the technical result of 229 consecutive carotid endarterectomies. Primary areas of evaluation included the proximal point of plaque transection and the internal and external carotid arteries at and distal to the termination of the endarterectomy. Subjective interpretation was made of the Doppler audio signal. Signs associated with inadequate technical results were a high-frequency signal indicative of luminal narrowing with a reduction in frequency distal to the area of stenosis, absence of a Doppler signal indicating occlusion, and a weak monophasic flow signal indicating poor distal perfusion. Abnormal signals were identified in 10 internal carotid arteries (4.3%) which prompted intraoperative angiography in eight and immediate reopening of the artery in an additional two. Significant lesions were identified in seven arteries (70%). Twenty external carotid lesions (8.7%) were detected by Doppler and in 19 cases (95%) a significant stenosis or obstruction was found when the vessel was reopened. Auscultation of a continuous-wave Doppler signal with a sterile probe at operation appears to have a high positive predictive value in the identification of both internal and external carotid stenoses. It is rapid, safe, relatively inexpensive, and avoids the problems associated with routine intraoperative angiography.",

    "abstract": "Most lower extremity amputations result from complications of diabetes and arterio-sclerotic occlusive diseases below the inguinal ligament. Improved limb salvage has been achieved by an aggressive approach to distal revascularization in the severely ischemic lower extremity. There remains, however, a high incidence of amputation resulting from progression of the ulceration or gangrene into deeper and less well-vascularized tissues, such as tendon and bone. Even in the nonischemic extremity, such wounds rarely heal without flap coverage. Microvascular free tissue transfers promote healing by providing coverage with healthy, nondiseased, well-vascularized tissue for these difficult defects. Successful free flap transfer requires a high-pressure recipient inflow vessel. In contrast to individuals with nonarteriosclerotic lesions, many individuals with nonhealing ischemic lesions have no acceptable artery demonstrated on high-resolution angiography to serve as a recipient vessel. Limb salvage has been achieved in four candidates for amputation utilizing distal revascularization followed by free tissue transfer coverage of the ischemic lower leg defects.",

    "abstract": "A 7-year experience with 90 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) femoropopliteal bypass grafts in the above-knee (AK) position is presented. The 5- and 7-year actuarial patency rate was 58.3%. No statistical difference was found between the patency rate of this series and that of a group of 17 AK and 77 below-knee (BK) femoropopliteal bypass grafts performed during the same period with the autologous saphenous vein (ASV). During the follow-up period (range 6 to 84 months, mean 42 months) a new bypass in a more distal location was required in 20 limbs. The ASV was available in seven of the eight PTFE graft failures and in only one of the 12 ASV failures. The 3-year patency rate of these new groups was 58.3% and 16.7%, respectively (p less than 0.02). Eighteen of the 48 deaths occurring during the follow-up period were related to atherosclerotic heart disease, whereas only one patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Five hundred patients randomly selected from our series of myocardial revascularization procedures were reviewed. In five a femorodistal reconstruction was performed before coronary artery bypass, and in only two (0.4%), the ASV was not available. PTFE use in the AK position may be a reasonable alternative to the ASV to preserve it for additional treatment of more distal occlusive disease. There is no evidence that such a need exists for further treatment of coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the success of endothelial cell-seeded and non-seeded small-diameter vascular grafts in dogs medicated with antiplatelet agents. Eighty dogs underwent bilateral carotid artery replacements with 6 cm lengths of 4 mm I.D. double-velour Dacron grafts. In each dog one graft was seeded with enzymatically derived autologous endothelial cells; the contralateral graft was nonseeded. The following anti-platelet medications were administered beginning 4 days preoperatively: aspirin (5 grains every day); dipyridamole (50 mg twice a day); aspirin plus dipyridamole (5 grains each day plus 50 mg twice a day); aspirin (1.25 grains every other day); ibuprofen (10 mg/kg/day); U-53,059, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (3 mg/kg/day); and U-63557A, a thromboxane synthase inhibitor (10 mg/kg/day). Grafts were harvested 5 weeks postoperatively. Graft success was evaluated by patency, thrombus-free surface area, area endothelialized, and graft production of prostacyclin. None of the medications prevented neoendothelialization of seeded grafts. Mean patencies of endothelial cell-seeded grafts from medicated dogs were significantly greater than mean patencies of endothelial cell-seeded grafts from nonmedicated dogs. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors best maintained patency in nonseeded grafts. Thrombus-free surface areas of endothelial cell-seeded grafts from medicated dogs were significantly greater than from nonseeded control grafts from the medicated dogs. All medications impaired prostacyclin synthesis. We conclude that the combination of endothelial cell seeding plus antiplatelet medication is most efficacious in small-vessel grafting success and that high levels of prostacyclin production by vascular grafts are not necessary to maintain patency in dogs medicated with antiplatelet agents.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has provided an alternative method of treatment for occlusive disease of the lower extremities. However, the long-term durability of PTA compared with that of surgical reconstruction has not been adequately evaluated. This study was undertaken to assess the long-term hemodynamic results of PTA. Thirty-four dilatations performed on 28 patients over a 30-month period and followed for 1 to 53 months were reviewed. Twenty-two dilatations were done in the iliac arteries, seven in the superficial femoral, three in the popliteal, one in the peroneal artery, and one at a bypass graft anastomosis. All patients underwent noninvasive measurements of lower extremity segmental pressure prior to dilatation and at scheduled follow-up intervals. Success was defined as an increase in the Doppler-derived segmental lower extremity/brachial index of greater than or equal to 0.15 or normalization of the index (greater than or equal to 0.90), measured at the closest level distal to the site of dilatation. Sixteen of 22 iliac dilatations (72.7%) were initially successful. However, long-term success was maintained in only six (27.6%). Cumulative hemodynamic success for the initially successful iliac dilatations was 28% at 3 years. Seven of 11 (63.6%) dilatations performed on infrainguinal arteries were initially successful; however, only two (18.2%) experienced continued success. Cumulative hemodynamic success for the initially successful infrainguinal dilatations in this group was 35% at 3 years. Although immediate patency and improvement in hemodynamic parameters are similar to comparable surgical procedures, these results demonstrate that PTA is not as durable as conventional surgical procedures.",
