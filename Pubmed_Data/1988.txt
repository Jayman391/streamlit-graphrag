    "abstract": "The influence of pressure, flow, and pulsatility on the release of prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane (measured as TxB2) was assessed in canine jugular veins perfused ex vivo with Hanks' balanced salt solution for five consecutive 15-minute periods. Control segments were perfused at 7 mm Hg with nonpulsatile flow at a rate of 90 ml/min, whereas experimental segments were perfused with pulsatile flow as well as nonpulsatile flow at pressures of 50 or 100 mm Hg and flow rates of 60 or 130 ml/min. Prostacyclin release from control segments during the first 15-minute period was 49.5 +/- 7.4 pg/mm2/15 min, which declined to 13.9 +/- 2.5 pg/mm2/15 min after 60 minutes (p less than 0.002). Arachidonic acid stimulation during the last 15-minute perfusion period increased the release to 56.1 +/- 9.4 pg/mm2/15 min (p less than 0.002). Thromboxane release from control segments was initially 4.4 +/- 1.2 pg/mm2/15 min, which declined to 0.8 +/- 0.2 pg/mm2/15 min after 60 minutes (p less than 0.002), and subsequently increased with arachidonic acid stimulation to 1.3 +/- 0.1 pg/mm2/15 min (p less than 0.01). In contrast to control perfusion conditions, changes in nonpulsatile flow rates did not affect prostacyclin release, whereas thromboxane release was lower when perfused at 60 ml/min. Pressures of 50 and 100 mm Hg increased the initial release of prostacyclin. Similarly, pulsatile flow enhanced prostacyclin release at both low and high pressures, being more pronounced with the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Both regimens began 3 days before insertion of PTFE aortic grafts (10 mm long and 3 mm internal diameter).

Morphologic techniques, including conventional light microscopy, immunoperoxidase staining for endothelial factor VIII-related antigen, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that neointima was composed of endothelial cells arising by ingrowth at anastomotic site and as islands in the center of the graft. The percentage of graft neoendothelialization was measured by SEM. At 2 weeks 18% +/- 2% of the PTFE surface was covered with endothelium in the aspirin/dipyridamole group. The percentages of graft neoendothelialization for the treatment and control groups at 4 weeks were 44% +/- 13% (n = 5) and 46% +/- 10% (n = 4) (p = NS), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To assess the value of exercise testing in the prediction of cardiac risk, 100 patients requiring arterial reconstructive surgery had either treadmill testing or arm ergometry before operation. Thirty-four patients then had abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, 48 had reconstructions for aortoiliac occlusive disease, and 18 had infrainguinal revascularization procedures. Cardiac complications included myocardial infarction in 10%, acute congestive failure in 5%, malignant ventricular arrhythmias in 7%, and cardiac death in 7%. Contingency table analysis showed that patients who achieved less than 85% of their predicted maximum heart rate (PMHR) during exercise testing had a complication rate of 24%, whereas patients who achieved more than 85% of PMHR had a 6% complication rate (p = 0.0396). The degree of ST segment depression during exercise testing was not a significant predictor of cardiac complications. However, patients who had a positive stress test (ST depression more than 1 mm) and achieved less than 85% of their PMHR had a complication rate of 33%, whereas patients with a positive stress test who achieved more than 85% of their PMHR had no complications (p = 0.048). Statistical analysis with a logistic regression model showed two factors to be significant. Patients who achieved a high maximum heart rate during exercise testing had a low probability of developing postoperative cardiac complications (p = 0.04), as did patients who achieved high cardiac work load maximal oxygen uptake (p = 0.03). We conclude that preoperative exercise testing is useful to predict cardiac complications after arterial reconstruction. Patients who are able to achieve more than 85% of their PMHR and a high maximal oxygen uptake represent a low-risk group.",

    "abstract": "A photoplethysmographic technique was used in 30 consecutive patients who had abdominal aortic reconstruction to assess colonic viability intraoperatively. A sterile pulse oximeter probe was used to measure arterial pulsatility and transcolonic oxygen saturation (TCOS) in the proximal, midportion, and distal sigmoid colon before and after the reconstruction. No attempt at inferior mesenteric revascularization was made, irrespective of the photoplethysmographic results. The status of the colon was assessed between the third and sixth postoperative day by a colonoscopist unaware of the intraoperative data. Before the reconstructive procedure photoplethysmography displayed pulsatile flow in all patients with a mean TCOS of 95% +/- 0.4%. After reconstruction, 28 patients (93%) demonstrated unchanged pulsatility with mean TCOS of 94% +/- 0.4%. Despite ligation of a patent inferior mesenteric artery in 10 of these patients, all 28 had normal colonoscopic examinations. By contrast, two patients (6.7%) had a loss of photoplethysmographic pulsatility with unmeasurable TCOS. Both of these patients had ligation of an initially patent inferior mesenteric artery and demonstrated evidence of ischemic mucosal changes at colonoscopy. Intraoperative colonic photoplethysmography represents an easily performed, accurate method for predicting colonic viability. A loss of pulsatility suggests inadequate postreconstructive colonic perfusion and mandates revascularization of the inferior mesenteric artery.",

    "abstract": "This is a prospective analysis of 351 patients in two distinct groups undergoing ascending phlebography, impedance plethysmography (IPG), and/or phleborheography (PRG) within the same 24-hour period. One hundred twenty patients also had a 125I-fibrinogen uptake test (RFUT). The two patient groups consisted of the following: those patients evaluated because of suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (diagnostic) and those patients at high risk for postoperative DVT (total joint replacement) who had routine noninvasive testing and ascending phlebography (surveillance). The overall sensitivities for IPG and PRG were significantly better in the diagnosis group (71% [69 of 97 patients] and 78% [82 of 105], respectively) compared with the surveillance group (20% [14 of 71] and 27% [17 of 63], respectively) (p less than 0.0001). The sensitivities for IPG and PRG detecting proximal (A/K) thrombi was 83% (68 of 82 patients) and 92% (79 of 86) in the diagnosis group compared with 32% (11 of 34) and 33% (9 of 27) in the surveillance group (p less than 0.0001). Although there was no difference in overall incidence of DVT between the diagnosis group (56%, 118 of 212 patients) and the surveillance group (55%, 76 of 139), the results can be explained by the difference in A/K thrombi (84% [99 of 118] and 47% [36 of 76]) (p less than 0.001) and occlusive A/K thrombi (84% [58 of 69] and 23% [7 of 31]) (p less than 0.0001), respectively. Of the patients with A/K thrombi, 97% (67 of 69) in the diagnosis group had hemodynamically detectable thrombi compared with only 48% (12 of 25) in the surveillance group (p less than 0.001). Combining the RFUT with the noninvasive studies for surveillance significantly improved the sensitivity for both A/K and distal thrombi. Patient selection also appears to have a significant influence on the results of the combination of IPG and RFUT when the current surveillance group is compared with similarly performed studies in a previously reported diagnosis group. The location and magnitude of thrombi in any patient population can be skewed depending on indications and timing of testing, thereby significantly affecting the sensitivity of noninvasive tests. IPG and PRG are reliable for evaluating patients with suspected DVT. However, patients with postoperative DVT have a high incidence of nonocclusive thrombi. Because noninvasive hemodynamic tests cannot identify accurately postoperative DVT, they cannot be used to generate epidemiologic data or as end points for studies evaluating efficacy of prophylaxis in patients undergoing total joint replacement, and anatomic studies of the deep venous system continue to be required.",

    "abstract": "In the past 14 years, 22 patients (25 operated sides), with occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), underwent ipsilateral external carotid artery (ECA) endarterectomy at our institution. Operative indications were amaurosis fugax in 13 sides and nonlateralizing transient ischemic attacks in the remaining 12. There were no operative deaths. One patient suffered a minor stroke after operation. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 110 months (median 36 months). In 16 cases, simple endarterectomy with or without vein patch closure was performed (type I). In two cases the ostium of the ICA was occluded with interrupted sutures after endarterectomy (type II). In the remaining seven cases the ICA was transposed as a patch over the endarterectomized ECA after endarterectomy (type III). All but six patients (six sides) underwent duplex scanning or angiography during follow-up. Four of nine patients with previous nonlateralizing symptoms had persistent symptoms after operation, whereas none of those with previous amaurosis fugax did. Recurrent occlusive disease was more common in type I reconstructions (p less than 0.05). Proper ECA reconstruction results in long-term patency. In the patient with ipsilateral ICA occlusion, transposition of the ICA as a patch over the endarterectomized ECA offers a valid hemodynamic solution. Objective parameters are needed to identify patients with nonlateralizing symptoms who will benefit from operation.",

    "abstract": "The usefulness of antiplatelet agents in vascular graft recipients remains controversial because of uncertainties regarding drug mechanisms of action and dose-duration effects. In our study, a well-characterized murine monoclonal antibody (LJ-CP8, 10 mg/kg) was infused into baboons to assess the hemostatic consequences and antithrombotic effectiveness of blocking the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor for fibrinogen and other adhesive glycoproteins. Five treated animals and six control animals were evaluated with serial measurements of platelet count, bleeding time, and platelet aggregation ex vivo (in response to adenosine diphosphate and collagen). Indium 111-labeled platelet deposition onto femoral vascular grafts (4 mm inner diameter Gore-Tex) implanted immediately after antibody infusion was measured by quantitative gamma camera imaging. Although the antibody did not alter circulating platelet counts, bleeding times were immediately prolonged to more than 30 minutes (vs. 4.8 +/- 0.4 minutes pretreatment) with only partial normalization by 48 hours (8.3 +/- 1.0 minutes, p less than 0.05). Platelet aggregation in response to both collagen and adenosine diphosphate was abolished immediately and remained impaired for 48 hours. Despite the profound inhibition of platelet function, graft platelet deposition was equivalent postoperatively in both the treated and untreated groups (p greater than 0.5), averaging approximately 5 x 10(9) platelets per graft. Graft-associated indium 111-labeled platelet activity increased over 48 hours and was not reduced by the antibody treatment (p greater than 0.5 at all times). All grafts were removed at 8 days; only one graft from a treated animal was found patent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord monitoring during thoracic aneurysmectomy by somatosensory evoked potentials has been criticized for its failure to measure anterior (motor) spinal cord function. We have developed a clinically applicable, noninvasive technique for intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEP), which allows direct functional assessment of spinal cord motor tracts during thoracic aortic occlusion. Twelve dogs underwent continuous intraoperative monitoring of MEP before, during, and after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. Motor tract response to noninvasive cord stimulation (5 to 10 mA, 0.02 msec, 4.3 H2) was recorded by subcutaneous electrodes placed along the length of the spine (T-10, L-1, and L-4). Six animals (group I) subjected to aortic cross-clamping alone demonstrated a characteristic time- and level-dependent deterioration and loss of MEP. Ischemic cord dysfunction (as determined by time from clamping to loss of MEP) progressed from the distal to the proximal cord (L-4 = 11.3 +/- 1.5 minutes; L-1 = 14.9 +/- 2.3 minutes; T-10 = 16.9 +/- 2.3 minutes; p less than 0.05 between all levels). Reperfusion of the distal aorta 20 minutes after clamping resulted in MEP return that progressed from the proximal (T-10) to distal (L-1 and L-4) cord. In another six animals (group II), distal perfusion (mean blood pressure = 95 mm Hg) was maintained for 1 hour after cross-clamping by left atrial-femoral artery bypass. Normal configuration and amplitude of MEP was maintained throughout the cross-clamping period. These data suggest that distinctive changes in MEP indicative of reversible ischemia of spinal cord motor tracts occur after aortic cross-clamping. Such ischemia begins in the most distal cord, exhibits upward progression with time, and can be prevented by maintenance of adequate distal aortic perfusion. Clinical use of MEP monitoring during thoracic aneurysmectomy may provide a method for intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of motor tract perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia occurs in 6.5% to 40% of patients after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms requiring aortic clamping. This study aimed to determine whether drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) done before aortic cross-clamping could decrease the incidence of paraplegia in dogs. The descending thoracic aorta was clamped distal to the left subclavian artery for either 40 minutes (group I) or 60 minutes (group II). All control animals in group I (10) and group II (10) showed evidence of spinal cord injury with paraparesis or paraplegia. In contrast, 9 of 10 animals (90%) in group I and 7 of 10 animals (70%) in group II that had CSF drainage before aortic cross-clamping were neurologically normal (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Aortic pressure distal to the aortic cross clamp was the same in all groups; however, spinal cord perfusion pressure (distal aortic pressure minus CSF pressure) was significantly higher in neurologically normal animals (34 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 15) compared with those with paraparesis (26 +/- 4 mm Hg, n = 8) or paraplegia (19 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 8) (r = 0.871, p less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that drainage of CSF before thoracic aortic occlusion significantly increases spinal cord perfusion pressure and decreases the incidence of paraplegia. Limited early clinical experience suggests that CSF drainage may be a useful adjunct to prevent paraplegia in patients who are having repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The association between cigarette smoking and the development of atherosclerosis is well established, but the mechanism that makes cigarettes such a potent \"risk factor\" is not understood. There is normally a constant insudation of plasma macromolecules into the arterial wall. Fibrinogen and lipids are two of the large molecules involved in atherosclerosis. Therefore we studied the effect of cigarette smoke, nicotine, and carbon monoxide on the permeability of the canine arterial wall to 125I-labeled fibrinogen. The results show that inhaled cigarette smoke significantly and rapidly increases the permeability of the arterial wall to fibrinogen and that this effect can be produced with carbon monoxide alone but not with intravenous nicotine.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs) in culture respond to repetitive tensional deformation with an increase in deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and cell proliferation. This study was designed to determine whether cyclic tensional deformation of ECs in vitro induces different morphologic or protein synthetic responses. ECs from passages 6 through 9 were seeded in 35 mm2 well silicone rubber plates at 2 x 10(5) cells/well and allowed to attach for 24 hours. The experimental group was placed in a vacuum-operated stress-providing device that exerted an elongation of 24% at maximum downward deflection of the culture plate bottom and was subjected to repetitive cycles of 10 seconds of 24% maximum elongation and 10 seconds of relaxation for 5 days. The control group was subjected to similar incubation conditions but without stretch. 35S-methionine (500 muCi/well) was added to the plates 24 hours before harvesting, and two-dimensional gels of the harvested lysates (isoelectric focusing with pH 3 to 10 ampholytes followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% gels) were performed and the labeled proteins visualized by autoradiography. The data indicate that there is a differential synthesis of proteins, with synthesis of some proteins decreased or ablated whereas other proteins were increased in response to cyclic mechanical tension. The actin filament organization was evaluated after staining with rhodamine phalloidin, a fluorescent F-actin probe. The ECs subjected to tension had a more polygonal shape and demonstrated pseudopods and actin stress fibers, whereas ECs cultured under static conditions were more rounded and did not express actin stress cables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The process of reendothelialization was studied in a deendothelialized 3 cm segment of the canine descending thoracic aorta from which peripheral endothelial cell ingrowth had been prevented by impervious prosthetic graft sleeves. Three preparations were studied: (1) removal of only the endothelial cells, accomplished by flow surface drying and balloon catheter denudation, (2) removal of the superficial portion of the nonvasal media, accomplished by endarterectomy to a depth of 200 to 300 micron, and (3) removal of the entire inner (nonvasal) media, accomplished by endarterectomy to a depth of 500 to 600 micron to reach the outer (vasal) media. A total of 44 specimens were studied after implantation periods of 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. In all cases endothelial cell ingrowth from the host aorta into the test specimen was prevented by the impervious graft sleeves. In the deep endarterectomy group there were scattered areas of reendothelialization at 1 week, extensive reendothelialization at 2 weeks, almost complete reendothelialization at 4 weeks, and confluence by 8 weeks. However, in the superficial endarterectomy group scanning electron microscopy showed scattered areas of factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (FVIII/vWF)-negative, endothelial-like cells at 4 weeks, whereas at 8 weeks most of the surface was covered by endothelial cells identified by FVIII/vWF. In those specimens subjected to balloon catheter removal of endothelial cells only, reendothelialization was not seen, even at 8 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Marine lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids (chiefly, eicosapentanoic acid [EPA] and docosahexanoic acid [DHA]) may inhibit the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, but the mechanisms responsible for this putative beneficial effect are unknown. We investigated the effects of EPA and DHA in a canine model of accelerated vein graft arteriosclerosis during a 3-month period. Twenty-five dogs were divided into three dietary groups: group I (control), group II (2.5% cholesterol), and group III (2.5% cholesterol plus 2 gm EPA/day [as MaxEPA]). The effects of EPA on vein graft intimal thickening, platelet and vascular prostaglandin metabolism, lipid and lipoprotein receptor metabolism, and hematologic parameters were assessed. Cholesterol feeding caused a significant 54% increase in graft intimal thickness compared with control animals (124.9 +/- 50.4 vs 81.2 +/- 32.4 micron; p = 0.013), which was prevented by supplementation with EPA in group III (56.9 +/- 30.0 micron; p = 0.001 vs group II). Intimal thickness in group III was not significantly different from that of control. EPA supplementation was also associated with a 38% decline in serum thromboxane levels from 457.0 +/- 129.3 pg/0.1 ml in group II to 283.5 +/- 96.9 pg/0.1 ml in group III (p = 0.007). The alterations in lipoprotein metabolism associated with cholesterol feeding were not affected by EPA: in both groups II and III, serum cholesterol and high-density lipoproteins and liver cholesterol content were elevated and hepatic low-density lipoproteins (LDL) receptor content was reduced. There were no differences between the three groups in terms of vein graft or native vessel prostacyclin production, hematocrit, platelet count, or coagulation parameters. In this canine model, dietary supplementation with marine omega-3 fatty acids reduced the extent and magnitude of accelerated vein graft intimal thickening induced by hypercholesterolemia; moreover, this beneficial effect was associated with lower serum thromboxane production and appeared to be independent of alterations in lipoprotein metabolism or LDL receptor density.",

    "abstract": "Neointimal fibromuscular hyperplasia (NFH) in vein grafts and perianastomotic zones of vascular prostheses has been attributed to the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) released by platelets interacting with bypass conduits. But inhibition of platelet aggregation often fails to prevent NFH, and recurrent growth of intact, platelet-free endothelium over perianastomotic areas where NFH occurs is inconsistent with the concept of sustained PDGF release from platelets causing NFH progression at late times after surgical procedures. Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs) and human umbilical vein ECs have been shown to release a PDGF-like molecule. We report that confluent cultured fourth passage adult human saphenous vein ECs (AHSVECs) grown in the presence of heparin (100 micrograms/ml) and retina-derived growth factor (RDGF) studied by Northern blotting transcribed a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of 3.9 kb, strongly hybridizing to PDGF B chain probes, and two species of 2.0 and 2.6 kb hybridizing to PDGF A chain probes. Withdrawal of RDGF and heparin from these cultures for 48 hours before mRNA extraction amplified the scanning densitometric mRNA signal per cell by 8.0 +/- 7.6 fold (mean +/- SD) (N = 4 cultures) for B chain mRNA and 5.2 +/- 3.6 fold (N = 3 cultures) for A chain mRNA. In addition, AHSVEC cultures released a PDGF-like substance, because 50% vol/vol AHSVEC-conditioned serum-free medium increased tritiated thymidine uptake elevenfold in PDGF receptor-bearing 3T3 cells whereas an excess (50 micrograms/ml) of nonspecific goat anti-human-PDGF antibody significantly reduced this increase by a mean of 30% to 7.0 +/- 3.4 fold (N = 6 trials, p less than 0.001). Flow cytometry determined AHSVEC cultures to be proliferating with a mean of 6.2% +/- 1.9% (N = 3 culture lines) of ECs in S phase even at confluence when deprived of EC mitogens for 48 hours. Adult human ECs, which proliferate on bypass conduits and host vessels after perioperative injury, may play a role in causing NFH by stimulating proliferation of adjacent smooth muscle cells. Prevention of NFH may require not only antiplatelet agents but also ways to prevent EC release of smooth muscle cell mitogens in response to perioperative EC injury.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the patient population and operative management of 666 patients with nonruptured aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Statistical significance of variables was determined by the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. There were no statistically significant differences (p greater than 0.05) in mortality rate for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on the basis of indication for surgery (asymptomatic, 3.9%; asymptomatic but with evidence of enlargement, 4.9%; and symptomatic, 7.2%) or the urgency of operation (elective operation, 4.5%; and urgent operation, 7.1%). Characteristics of the 72 participating surgeons did not influence the operative mortality rate. A family history of AAA was documented in 6.1% of cases and was more common if the patient was female (p = 0.03) and less than 65 years of age (p = 0.04). Patients without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease had a 0.8% mortality rate from cardiac disease compared with 6.2% if any stigmata of coronary disease were present. Prior aortocoronary bypass surgery did not reduce the incidence of postoperative cardiac events or operative mortality rate. Patients having \"routine\" angiography did not have a less complicated operative course, fewer thrombotic complications, or lower mortality rate than those not having it. Those patients with an inflammatory AAA (4.5%) did not have a significantly higher incidence of pain. Heparin administration (84.8%) did not reduce the complications of graft thrombosis, \"trash,\" distal thrombosis, and/or amputation. The 6.8% of patients requiring suprarenal aortic cross-clamping had a higher incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction (p = 0.02) and intraoperative blood loss (p less than 0.001), but cardiac events were not more frequent. When the aortic cross-clamping time was prolonged (more than 70 minutes), the requirement for crystalloid fluid administration increased (p less than 0.001) and postoperative myocardial infarction was more common (p = 0.004). After ligation of the left renal vein in 7.9%, renal damage or dialysis was more frequent (p = 0.01). Patients having an intra-abdominal graft (tube, 38.5% and biiliac, 30.7%) had fewer wound infections (p = 0.02) and graft thromboses (p less than 0.001) than the patients with a femoral anastomosis. When the internal iliac artery flow was interrupted bilaterally (12%), diarrhea (p = 0.03) and ischemic colitis (p = 0.03) were more frequent complications. Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery was carried out in 4.8%. After renal artery bypass in 2.1%, the mortality rate was not increased, but the incidence of transient renal dysfunction was increased (p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relationship of the site of venous valvular incompetence to the severity of venous reflux, legs of 71 patients with suspected chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated with Doppler ultrasonography and photoplethysmography. A venous recovery time (VRT) of less than 20 seconds after calf muscle exercise was considered indicative of significant reflux. Average VRTs were brief in 15 legs with stasis changes (10 +/- 7 seconds), longer in 42 legs with edema (26 +/- 23 seconds), and normal in 64 asymptomatic legs (37 +/- 24 seconds) and 16 legs with pain (53 +/- 19 seconds). Average VRTs in limbs with incompetent saphenous veins were abnormal. In limbs with competent superficial veins, only those with incompetent distal deep veins (popliteal and posterior tibial) had abnormal VRTs (14 +/- 10 seconds). VRTs in limbs with no detectable valvular incompetence and in those with incompetence limited to the proximal deep veins (common and superficial femoral) were normal (47 +/- 23 and 42 +/- 27 seconds, respectively). When superficial veins were incompetent, an ankle tourniquet normalized VRTs in 63% of legs with proximal deep venous incompetence and in only 33% of legs with distal deep venous incompetence. It is concluded that venous reflux is largely determined by saphenous and distal deep valvular function and that competence of the proximal valves has little effect. Decreased venous reflux would not be expected after proximal valvular reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CsA) was explored as a means of preventing arterial allograft rejection and failure. Aortic allografts across the major histocompatibility barrier were studied in Brown-Norway and Lewis inbred rats. Grafts 1 cm long were interposed into the infra-abdominal aorta of Lewis recipients; five groups included two groups of untreated isograft and allograft control animals and three groups had allograft-CsA treatment regimens. The grafts were examined at 30, 60, and 100 days for patency, aneurysmal dilation, gross structural changes, inflammatory responses, and infiltration of W3/25- and OX8-positive lymphocytes. Only three allograft controls became occluded; the rest showed significant dilation (p less than 0.01), medial thinning and necrosis, intimal proliferation, and prominent cellular infiltration at 30 days. With all CsA regimens, aneurysmal dilation was significantly reduced or prevented (p less than 0.01), correlating with medial smooth muscle cell preservation. Cellular infiltration was delayed by an average daily dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg subcutaneous CsA for 30 days and was suppressed at 100 days by a continuous 5 mg/kg dose every 4 days. Intimal thickening in the graft was delayed but not prevented. We conclude that a low maintenance dose of CsA provides effective immunosuppression, thereby preventing aneurysm formation, and that the potential use of arterial allografts in vascular surgery may need to be readdressed.",

    "abstract": "A canine model was developed to study the efficacy of graft replacement as treatment for vascular prosthesis infections from Staphylococcus epidermidis. Infrarenal aortic graft infections were established in 18 dogs by implantation of Dacron prostheses colonized in vitro with a slime-producing strain of S. epidermidis to form an adherent bacteria-laden biofilm (5 X 10(6) colony-forming units/cm2 graft). Study animals developed a graft infection with anatomic and microbiologic characteristics typical of late prosthetic graft infections in humans (sterile perigraft exudate, absent graft incorporation, and normal serum leukocyte count and sedimentation rate). The S. epidermidis study strain was isolated from 14 of 18 explanted grafts (78%) by mechanical disruption of the graft surface biofilm and culture in broth media. Four dogs with sterile graft cultures had histologic evidence of bacterial infection. The established prosthetic surface biofilm infection was treated by graft excision, parenteral cefazolin, and graft replacement with a Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular prosthesis. One month after graft replacement, no PTFE graft had signs of infection, but perigraft exudate and inflammation involved three of nine Dacron grafts (33%). The study strain was recovered from four of nine PTFE grafts (44%) and two of nine Dacron (22%) replacement grafts (p greater than 0.05). Prosthetic replacement of Dacron prostheses infected by S. epidermidis as a bacteria-laden surface biofilm can result in early graft healing, but persistent colonization of one third of replacement grafts signify that recurrent clinical infection remains a risk.",

One hundred seventeen long vein grafts (LVGs) were longer than 40 cm (42 to 92 cm, mean 60.9 +/- 9 cm) and 120 short vein grafts (SVGs) were 40 cm or shorter (6 to 40 cm, mean 24.7 +/- 8 cm). Ninety-three percent of the LVGs originated from or were proximal to the superficial femoral artery (SFA) whereas all of the SVGs originated at or distal to the SFA. The cumulative patency rate for LVGs at 3 years was 45% and for SVGs was 63% (p less than 0.025). In the absence of an intact pedal arch, 3-year patency rates for LVGs (51 cases) and SVGs (78 cases) were 22% and 53%, respectively (p less than 0.01). High intraoperative outflow resistance measurements (greater than 0.7 mm Hg/ml/min) were encountered in 25 cases. Of these, occlusion within 6 months occurred in six of seven cases with LVGs and in only 8 of 18 cases with SVGs (p less than 0.05). Wound complications at vein harvest sites occurred in 17% of LVGs and in only 6% of SVGs (p less than 0.01). Of 16 additional cases in which a proximal patch angioplasty or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed tandem with a short distal vein graft, four occluded (less than 6 months) and 12 remained patent from 3 to 43 months (mean 12.6 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Patients were required to purchase their medication at a cost of $28 to $35 per month. The drug was administered regardless of the severity of symptoms, and no patient was offered operation without at least a 6-week trial of PTFX. An assessment of the severity of IC was made at the initial visit based on noninvasive data and the impact of the IC on the patient's life-style. One hundred thirty patients were enrolled in the study and were followed for 9 +/- 1 months. Patients were seen every 2 months for treadmill exercise or induced hyperemic testing and interviews until the effects of the medication were determined. The duration of IC before the start of treatment had no effect on the results. IC did not improve in 88 patients (71%) followed for 7.2 +/- 1 month. Thirty-six of these patients stopped the drug themselves because there was no benefit and the expense of PTFX was a hardship. An initial but short-lived improvement in walking was noted in another 13 patients (10%) following 14 +/- 2 months, and the medication was eventually discontinued. Only 23 patients (19%) followed for 11.6 +/- 2 months felt that IC had improved to the point where they did not feel limited in any way. Gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 13 patients and were severe in eight patients (6%) who stopped taking the medication.

    "abstract": "A new high-speed rotary atherectomy device, inserted over a guide wire and directed with an angioscope, offers the potential of restoring patency of outflow vessels by \"boring out\" the atheromatous lesion of the orifices of runoff vessels. The device was tested on 68 cadaver arteries with atheromatous lesions involving the superficial femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries. This was performed with either free segments or in situ with the device placed through a popliteal arteriotomy. The gross results of rotary atherectomy were assessed by angioscopy, angiography, or both. The luminal surfaces were studied with scanning electron microscopy and transverse sections of vessels were studied with light microscopy. The pulverized atheroma, in colloidal suspension, was analyzed for particle size by Coulter counter. The effect of a colloidal suspension of atheromatous particles on distal capillary circulation was measured in animal experiments. Obstructive lesions were successfully removed in 36 of 37 stenotic arteries (97%) and 18 of 31 completely occluded arteries (58%), an overall efficacy of 54 of 68 (79%). In successfully atherectomized arteries, angioscopy and angiography demonstrated a widely patent, smooth, polished surface. Light microscopy demonstrated removal of the diseased intima with maintenance of the outer media and adventitia. The pulverized atheroma particles were generally smaller than red blood cells and injection of the colloidal atheroma into canine femoral arteries failed to produce local tissue injury. We conclude that in the human cadaver this atherectomy device effectively enlarges and recanalizes obstructed superficial femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Several retrospective community surveys have provoked speculation concerning the safety of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) throughout the United States. To address this serious issue, surgical outcome was calculated for 8535 CEAs entered prospectively into a computer registry by 51 trained vascular surgeons in a large metropolitan area from 1973 to 1985. A total of 7480 procedures (88%) were performed for symptomatic lesions and 1055 (12%) were performed for asymptomatic stenosis or ulceration. There were 178 operative strokes (2.1%) and 135 early deaths (1.6%), for a combined morbidity-mortality rate of 3.2%. Fatal events were attributed to cardiac disease in 0.7%, neurologic complications in 0.6%, and other causes in 0.3%. The stroke rate (n = 148; 2.0%) in symptomatic patients was better than that in asymptomatic patients (n = 30; 2.8%) (chi 2 = 5.2; p less than 0.025), but the combined morbidity-mortality rates (2.9% and 3.7%) were not statistically different. The incidence of stroke reported by surgeons who performed more than 5 CEAs annually (1.7%) was statistically superior to the stroke rate (3.4%) among those with less experience (chi 2 = 37.1; p less than 0.0001). Nevertheless, both groups had acceptable results that were consistent with their training and continued interest in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Among 1500 carotid endarterectomies performed between 1975 and 1984, 11 ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhages (IH) occurred between the first and tenth postoperative days for an incidence of 0.7%. The mortality rate among these patients was 36%. The only recognizable predisposing factor was relief of high-grade carotid stenosis (greater than 90%) whereas other factors such as age (58 to 81 years), preoperative hypertension (systolic blood pressure 120 to 160 mm Hg), preoperative head CT scans showing recent infarction (only one in five positive), and preoperative cerebral infarction (only 1 of 11 patients) did not play a role. All patients had normal coagulation studies. No patient required a shunt because all tolerated cross-clamping of the carotid artery. Postoperative systolic blood pressures were 200 to 240 mm Hg in 6 of 11 patients. The time of occurrence of IH extended from the immediate postoperative period to the tenth postoperative day (mean interval 3.3 days). Treatment consisted of craniotomy in five patients; four survived and one recovered completely. Of the six patients treated nonoperatively, three survived and two completely recovered. IH shares equal incidence with recurrent thrombosis, cross-clamping ischemia, and embolization as a cause of perioperative stroke. Although all except IH can be prevented by current practice, the means of preventing IH are not apparent; however, careful monitoring of blood pressure to prevent uncontrolled hypertension deserves consideration.",

    "abstract": "In a collaborative prospective study from two institutions, we reviewed the clinical course of 969 consecutive patients who had 1200 carotid endarterectomies (CEs) for the treatment of occlusive arterial disease during the period 1977 to 1987. The indications for CE comprised transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in 581 cases (48.4%), cerebral infarction (CI) in 170 (14.2%), monocular blindness in 166 (13.8%), and asymptomatic stenosis in 283 (23.6%). Neurologic monitoring of the awake patient provided more reliable indication of the need for brain protection during operative arterial clamping than did electroencephalography or carotid stump pressure measurement. Of the 1200 cases, 113 (9%) required a shunt as determined by this method. Patients with contralateral carotid occlusion or severe stenosis required shunting six times more frequently than those with a unilateral lesion. Among all procedures, there were nine cases of transient neurologic deficit (0.9%), 11 cases of permanent neurologic deficit (0.9%), and eight deaths (0.67%). Among 283 CEs performed to treat asymptomatic lesions, no strokes and only one death (0.4%) occurred. One hundred sixty-six cases with amaurosis fugax were operated on without stroke or death. In the age group of 70 to 90 years, 508 procedures were carried out with four deaths (0.8%) and three strokes (0.6%). We conclude that CE performed with the patient under local anesthesia is safe and effective and permits satisfactory management of old and high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing appreciation for the high incidence of silent cerebral infarction and cerebral atrophy on CT scans in patients with amaurosis fugax (AF) and hemispheric transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Seventy patients with AF only (no TIAs), 104 patients with hemispheric TIAs (no AF), 185 patients without focal carotid territory symptoms (i.e., vertebrobasilar TIAs or asymptomatic carotid bruit only), and 129 patients with stroke and good recovery were studied with CT scan and duplex scanning to grade the degree of stenosis of the internal carotid artery (grades: A = normal, B = 0% to 15% stenosis, C = 16% to 49%, D = 50% to 99%, and E = occlusion). In patients with AF, the incidence of infarction increased from 20% in grades A, B, and C to 40% in grade D and 58% in grade E. The incidence of atrophy increased in parallel from 10% in grade A to 30% in grade E. The increased incidence of atrophy with increasing degrees of stenosis was not the result of increasing degrees of stenosis per se, but the associated increase in the incidence of infarction (patients without CT infarcts in grades D and E had 5% and 0% incidence of atrophy). In patients with hemispheric TIAs, the incidence of CT infarction increased from 25% in grades A and B to 48% in grades D and E. The incidence of atrophy did not show a parallel increase. Our findings support the hypothesis that atrophy is associated not only with cerebral infarction but may be causally related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Although the retroperitoneal aortic approach (RP) is advocated to reduce myocardial ischemia and cardiac-related death, inadequate physiologic data exist to support this contention. As the aorta is exposed via the transabdominal approach (TA) we noted some patients have manifested reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR) associated with tachycardia, reduced blood pressure, and facial flushing. To determine whether RP offered physiologic advantages over TA we compared cardiac dynamics and blood levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, during exposure of the aorta in 52 patients (33 with TA and 19 with RP), comparable in age, cardiac history, medications, and body surface area. Serial measurements of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, wedge pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were obtained. Results revealed decreased mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance, increased cardiac index and heart rate, and facial flush occurring 10 minutes after the bowel was explored in TA. This was not observed in RP. These hemodynamic alterations correlated in time and magnitude with a fourteen fold increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. These changes in cardiac indexes can produce increased myocardial oxygen consumption with the risk for myocardial ischemia, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease. The absence of this response to bowel exploration in RP may account for some of the observed advantages in \"high-risk\" aortic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Since ultrasonic energy can be used to interrogate vessels at great depth, it is only natural that it should be applied to deeply placed arteries in the abdomen. Early studies suggested that high-grade stenoses of the renal artery could be detected by this approach as long as the peak systolic velocity in the renal artery was normalized by that measured in the abdominal aorta. A retrospective study comparing the peak velocity in the renal artery to that from the adjacent abdominal aorta (the renal aortic ratio) showed that if this value exceeded 3.5, it is likely to be associated with a greater than 60% diameter-reducing stenosis. To test this hypothesis, we used duplex scanning to prospectively evaluate 58 renal arteries in 29 patients in whom arteriograms were available. There were 39 renal arteries with 0% to 59% stenosis, 14 with 60% to 99% stenosis, and five occlusions by angiography. Renal duplex scanning accurately diagnosed 38 of 39, 11 of 14, and four of five of these, respectively, giving a sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 94% for the detection of a greater than 60% diameter-reducing stenosis. The overall agreement with angiography was 93%. These data show that renal duplex scanning can be used to diagnose renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension or renal dysfunction, thus providing a rational basis for the selection of patients for angiography.",

A prospective study was undertaken to determine its value with random selection between primary closure and saphenous vein patching. A consecutive series of 129 carotid endarterectomies was evaluated by duplex scanning at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. Intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in the first postoperative days for control of the surgical technique and after 1 year to serve as a reference for the duplex scanning. Sixty-two patients were selected to have primary closure and 67 were chosen for the patching technique. Both groups were identical with regard to risk factors (mean age 63 years, 74% were men, 57% had hypertension, 41% had coronary disease, 37% had peripheral arterial disease, and 9% had diabetes mellitus), side of operation (55% left), symptoms (18% were asymptomatic), and postoperative DSA (81% were normal, 17% had residual lesions, and 2% had occlusions). A complete 1-year follow-up was obtained in 105 cases (81%); duplex scanning showed recurrent stenosis of more than 50% in 12 cases (11%). This was significantly higher after primary closure (10 of 48 patients = 21%) compared with patch closure (2 of 57 = 3.5%; p = 0.006) and also in women (6 of 25 = 24%) compared with men (6 of 80 = 7.5%; p = 0.03). Recurrent stenosis was present in 6 of 11 women with primary closure (55%), 4 of 37 men with primary closure (11%), 2 of 43 men with patching (5%), and none of 14 women with patch closure (0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Three hundred twenty-five cases of spontaneous aortic dissection seen at two institutions between 1965 and 1986 were reviewed to assess the incidence, morbid sequelae, and specific management of aortic branch compromise. Noncardiac vascular complications occurred in 33% of the study group, and in these patients the overall mortality rate (51%) was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than in patients without (29%) such complications. Although aortic rupture was the strongest correlate of mortality (90%), death specifically related to vascular occlusion was common when such occlusion occurred in the carotid, mesenteric, and renal circulation. There was a strong correlation between stroke and carotid occlusion (22/26 cases), yet specific carotid revascularization was only used during the chronic phase of the disease. Similarly, peripheral operation was ineffective in reducing the mortality rate in the setting of mesenteric (87%) and renal (50%) ischemia. Fifteen patients required either fenestration or graft replacement of the abdominal aorta for acute obstruction, rupture, or chronic aneurysm development. Thirty-eight patients (12%) demonstrated some degree of lower extremity ischemia, and one third of these required a direct approach on the abdominal aorta or iliofemoral segments to restore circulation. Selected patients with acute aortic dissection may require peripheral vascular operation in accordance with a treatment strategy that directs initial attention to the immediate life-threatening complications.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-two patients were selected from a group of 33 patients who underwent recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) thrombolysis for thrombosed infrainguinal bypass grafts of the lower extremity and were compared with 38 matched patients who had undergone surgical thrombectomy during the same period. The proportion of persons with diabetes mellitus, smokers, and types of bypass grafts was similar in both groups. More patients in the rt-PA-treated group had hypertension (p = 0.01). To evaluate the different lengths of follow-up, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used with a log-rank test to compare the proportion of persons with patent grafts in the two treatment groups. At 30 days, 86% of the rt-PA-treated grafts were still patent compared with 42% of the surgically treated grafts (p = 0.001). When risk factors on the Kaplan-Meier curves were compared, there was no statistical difference with regard to graft patency among the groups. According to simultaneous Cox regression analysis, no risk factor was significantly associated with graft patency. When amputation was evaluated between treatment groups simultaneously with other risk factors in a logistic regression analysis, smoking and age of the graft were marginally significant (p = 0.07), whereas all other factors were clearly not significant. In 91% of the rt-PA-treated patients, a secondary surgical procedure was required to maintain patency of the graft segment. Eighty-nine percent of the surgically treated patients required similar graft revisions. Two patients in the surgical group and one patient in the rt-PA-treated group had major complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Between October 1975 and November 1985, 907 lower limb bypasses were constructed in 715 patients (799 limbs) with glutaraldehyde-stabilized umbilical veins (UV-G) used as the predominant, or sole, graft material. Each reconstruction was classified in one of eight categories depending on the site of the distal anastomosis: above- and below-knee popliteal, anterior and posterior tibial, peroneal, trifurcation, sequential, and crural (tibial or peroneal) bypasses with adjunctive distal arteriovenous fistulas. Primary and secondary cumulative graft patency rates were determined for each category as well as cumulative actual palliation that combines end points of graft failure, amputation, and death. Half-life patencies for popliteal, tibial, and peroneal bypasses were 6.5, 2.3, and 1.7 years, respectively. Perioperative graft thrombosis occurred in 11% of popliteal reconstructions compared with 22% for the crural group. Nonocclusive graft failure caused by infection, aneurysm, or progressive foot gangrene occurred in 87 grafts (8%). The overall infection rate was 4.3%. Anastomotic aneurysms (1.4%) and strictures (2.1%) occurred infrequently as isolated phenomena. The incidence of graft dilatation and aneurysms assumed significant proportion after 5 years (36% aneurysms and 21% dilation); the diagnosis was particularly facilitated by B-mode imaging. Nevertheless, the overall clinical impact of graft degradation remained minimal (6% after 5 years). Twenty-two of 26 graft aneurysms were excised with successful graft replacement achieved in 10. During this 10-year period, our attitudes did change with regard to the indication for UV-Gs in relation to the maturation of infrapopliteal reconstructive surgery, appreciation of the superior results attainable with in situ saphenous vein, recognition of morphologic changes in long-term UV-G implants, and the growing documentation of poor results with polytetrafluorethylene in the crural position. We believe that UV-G is an acceptable alternative to the absent or deficient autologous vein, particularly in patients with limited life expectancy and where expediency may be a critical factor.",

    "abstract": "Platelet aggregation and release phenomena are central to most postulated mechanisms of thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia after carotid endarterectomy. Therefore high-dose aspirin (HDA) has been advocated to minimize these sources of endarterectomy failure. We have defined low-dose aspirin (LDA) that selectively blocks platelet cyclooxygenase but preserves arterial wall cyclooxygenase in the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We compared this theoretically optimal aspirin dose with HDA and no treatment (control) in a model of carotid endarterectomy. The aspirin was started before operation and continued for 6 weeks after operation, at which time the endarterectomized vessels were excised. The patency and morphologic findings of the arteries were measured. Platelet function was monitored by bleeding time and serum thromboxane A2 determinations. LDA and HDA were associated with 100% patency, whereas the control group had 50% patency. However, HDA did not protect the vessel from developing neointimal hyperplasia, which was seen in the control group and was associated with platelet adherence to the flow surface at 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, LDA significantly decreased but did not totally prevent neointimal hyperplasia and the flow surface was healed. Therefore the genesis of neointimal hyperplasia after endarterectomy may be more complex than simply a function of platelet-vessel wall interaction.",

    "abstract": "Aortic tissue elastase and alpha 1-antitrypsin were assayed in 67 patients with different types of infrarenal aortic disease; occlusive disease, elective abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), multiple aneurysms, and ruptured aneurysms. Elastase modified by alpha 1-antitrypsin (elastase/alpha 1-antitrypsin) increased significantly as the type of aortic disease changed from occlusive to aneurysmal disease. Aortic elastase was significantly higher in patients with AAAs, multiple aneurysms, and ruptured AAAs compared with occlusive disease. The alpha 1-antitrypsin, was significantly lower in patients with multiple aneurysms and ruptured AAAs. These data suggest that the ratio between elastase and its major serum inhibitor, alpha 1-antitrypsin, is significantly altered in the aortic wall in different types of infrarenal aortic disease. In addition, the ratio between these two enzyme systems changes in favor of more proteolytic activity as the type of infrarenal disease changes from occlusive to aneurysmal.",

    "abstract": "Laser energy can vaporize biologic tissues, and this unique method of ablation has been considered for the disobstruction of the occlusive lesion in atherosclerotic disease. To assess the potential embolic sequelae from laser angioplasty, solid phase debris (SPD) was analyzed. Specimens of human cadaver aorta were subjected to standardized argon laser injury, and SPD was quantified by weight in four types of ablated tissue: normal aortic intima, fatty streaks, fibrous plaque, and calcified plaque (CP). The debris by weight of tissue ablated was significantly higher for CP (p less than 0.05), measuring 7.9%, whereas normal aortic intima, fatty streaks, and fibrous plaque yielded 3.2%, 2.7%, and 3.7%, respectively. Likewise, the amount of debris liberated per unit volume of albated tissue was greatest for CP averaging 156 mg/cc. Light and scanning electron microscopy of SPD revealed carbonized tissue particles up to 350 mumol from all classes and cholesterol crystals up to 250 mumol from CP. SPD from CP was infused into renal arteries of rats at two dosages, 4 and 16 mg, to observe effects on end-organ tissue. At 10 days, all kidneys demonstrated focal ischemic atrophy and recovering acute tubular necrosis in a dose-dependent fashion (p less than 0.05). Control rats showed no disease. Kidneys embolized with SPD also displayed foreign body granulomas (9 of 12), periarterial inflammation (11 of 12), and cortical wedge infarcts (10 of 12). Argon laser energy that ablates tissue predominantly by thermal mechanisms liquified or vaporized 96% to 97% of noncalcified atheromatous material. Laser ablation of CP, however, liberated significantly more SPD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Video angioscopy was employed in 12 patients to monitor thrombectomy or embolectomy within prosthetic bypass grafts (n = 4), saphenous vein grafts (n = 2), and native femoropopliteal arteries (n = 6). A flexible, 2.8 mm diameter angioscope was introduced into the vessel for confirmation and accurate localization of the diagnosed embolus. A Fogarty embolectomy balloon catheter was passed alongside the angioscope and balloon inflation was visually calibrated to the exact vessel lumen. Thromboembolic debris was then retrieved under direct visualization. Intraoperative angiograms were obtained in all cases and results were compared with the finding at angioscopy. After conventional thrombectomy, angioscopic inspection revealed residual thrombus within the lumen or adherent to the wall in 10 of 12 cases. Residual debris was also identified in tributary vessels in two cases, and the embolectomy catheter was successfully guided into these channels by the tip of the scope. Limb salvage was achieved in all but one patient, with early follow-up of up to 18 months. As a result of this experience we conclude that angioscopic thromboembolectomy has several advantages over the traditional blind technique: (1) accurate detection and localization of thrombus or embolus; (2) monitoring and control of the degree of balloon inflation, thereby preventing vessel wall damage caused by overinflation; (3) detection and retrieval of residual clot after blind embolectomy; (4) manipulation of the balloon catheter to selected vessels; (5) decreased requirement for repeated arteriograms; (6) increased speed, convenience, and accuracy when compared with intraoperative angiography; and (7) avoidance of surgical exposure of the distal popliteal and tibial vessels.",

    "abstract": "Among 211 limbs with nonobstructive chronic venous insufficiency, valve reflux of the deep system was the predominant (more than 70%) pathologic condition. Superficial venous or perforator incompetence when present invariably occurred in combination with valve reflux of the deep veins, suggesting that the latter is a common denominator for symptom production. Single level-single system reflux was only occasionally symptomatic (10%), whereas the incidence of single level-multisystem reflux (25%) and multilevel-multisystem reflux (65%) in symptomatic limbs was much higher. Our experience with 107 venous valve reconstructions with a 2- to 8-year follow-up is described. Different techniques of valve reconstruction employed are detailed. The most common pathologic feature is a redundant valve with malcoaptation probably of nonthrombotic origin. Valsalva foot venous pressure elevation is a useful hemodynamic technique for assessing surgical results. Valvuloplasty may be superior to other reconstruction techniques in relieving symptoms of stasis, including stasis ulceration.",

    "abstract": "The goal of carotid endarterectomy is to remove an obstructing or embologenic lesion and reconstruct a durable arterial segment free of flow abnormality. The technical adequacy of 250 endarterectomy sites in 235 patients was assessed at operation by pulsed Doppler spectral analysis and arteriography and was correlated with postoperative patency, the incidence of residual and recurrent stenosis, and clinical outcome. Duplex scanning was used after operation to categorize disease severity. At operation, 10 patients (4%) had angiographic and Doppler flow abnormalities identified in the internal carotid artery. Vessel exploration identified intimal flaps, platelet aggregation, or stricture. Residual flow disturbances at the endarterectomy site correlated with perioperative thrombosis and stroke, angiographic abnormalities, primary closure of the arteriotomy, and a postoperative duplex scan consistent with stenosis. In 175 patients (182 sites) with normal arterial flow after carotid bifurcation endarterectomy, no thrombotic events occurred and the incidence of recurrent stenosis (life-table analysis) was zero at 3 months, 5% at 1 year, and 9% at 2 years. The incidence of occlusion and recurrent stenosis was increased (8% at 3 months, 18% at 1 year, and 21% at 2 years) in 68 arteries with residual flow disturbance identified at operation. Assessment of endarterectomy sites for turbulence identifies anatomic lesions that threaten patency and increase the incidence of residual and recurrent stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial Doppler (TCD) insonation permits quantitative noninvasive evaluation of intracerebral arterial velocity. With the use of a 2 MHz Doppler through a transtemporal approach, middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA-V, centimeters per second) and major collaterals were measured in 96 patients, including 15 normal control subjects, 66 patients with extracranial cerebrovascular disease (ECCVD), and 15 patients with other medical problems without ECCVD. MCA-V was higher in control subjects (62.7 +/- 15.1) than in patients with ECCVD (45.0 +/- 16.3, p less than 0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between MCA-V and the degree of internal carotid artery stenosis present by duplex examination. Twenty-three patients monitored during carotid endarterectomy had a mean MCA-V under anesthesia of 37.0 +/- 16.9, which decreased to 22.4 +/- 14.8 during cross-clamping (p less than 0.01). MCA-V during cross-clamping correlated directly with stump pressure (R = 0.87) and was higher when major collaterals were identified before operation by TCD than when none were seen (31.7 +/- 9.5 vs. 8.8 +/- 8.5, p less than 0.01). Shunt function was verified in all 11 patients shunted. Electroencephalographic changes occurred in four patients with an MCA-V of 14.7 +/- 8.5 compared with an average of 24.1 +/- 15.5 for patients with normal electroencephalograms. MCA-V increased from 46.6 +/- 21.2 before operation to 61.0 +/- 22.4 after carotid endarterectomy (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Almost 75% of carotid body and cervical paragangliomas are adherent to or surround adjacent arteries and cranial nerves. Their resection can result in neurovascular injury, stroke, and excessive blood loss. To assess trends in neurovascular complications, we reviewed 153 carotid body and cervical paragangliomas that were surgically managed between 1935 and 1985. Results of the past 10 years were compared with two previous time periods: period I (1935 to 1965), when carotid artery reconstruction was uncommon at our institution, and period II (1966 to 1975), when methods of intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring and carotid patch angioplasty were being developed. During the past 10 years (period III), surgical approach to these tumors has included intraoperative monitoring of cerebral blood flow, selective use of shunts, vein patch or graft reconstructions after extensive tumor resections, and mobilization of the parotid gland to facilitate adequate exposure of high tumors. Although tumor resection was attempted in 80% of patients in period I, surgical resection was complete in 98% during periods II and III. Three trends were observed: (1) The perioperative stroke rate has decreased dramatically from 23% in period I to 2.7% in period III (p = 0.007); (2) the perioperative mortality rate has been reduced from 6% in period I to no deaths in the past 10 years, but (3) the rate of postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction remains unchanged over 50 years (period I, 46%; period III, 40%). The median tumor size among patients with postoperative complications was significantly larger than those without complications (median size: 17 vs. 7 cm3, p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Heparin-binding growth factor-I (HBGF-I) produces a significant increase in endothelial cell replication in vitro and may prove useful for endothelial regeneration and endothelial seeding in vivo. Heparin enhances the mitogenic effects of HBGF-I in vitro and may be an important adjunct to its pharmacologic use. Binding studies in the rat were undertaken to determine the feasibility of use of HBGF-I in vivo. For saturation studies, 125I-labeled HBGF-I was administered intravenously at various concentrations with heparin (approximately 5 U/ml blood volume). Further binding studies were conducted with the use of a constant concentration of 125I-labeled HBGF-I (40 ng) with or without heparin (2.5 U/ng HBGF-I). In each case, the rat was perfused with ice-cold saline solution 5 minutes after drug administration and the aorta or carotid arteries were harvested. 125I-labeled HBGF-I with heparin demonstrated saturation binding to rat aortic endothelium at an approximate blood concentration of 10 ng/ml. Scatchard plot analysis of in vivo data revealed a binding constant (KD) of 1.60 +/- 0.004 x 10(-9) mol/L compared with 2 to 8 x 10(-10) mol/L obtained for in vitro binding. Receptor number per cell was approximately 3000 for rat aortic endothelium, compared with a receptor number of 2000 to 20,000 for several endothelial cell lines, including bovine aortic endothelial cells, determined in vitro. 125I-labeled HBGF-I binding to uninjured rat carotid endothelium was significantly increased (p = 0.0001) by heparin (463 +/- 302 cpm to 1172 +/- 403 cpm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "A 15-year experience with 27 patients, 20 to 75 years of age, with refractory venous stasis ulcers is presented. All patients had been managed with support hose, elevation, elastic wraps, Unna's paste boots, and graduated compression stockings. Because of multiple recurrences of their ulcers, the patients were offered surgical treatment to reduce the venous hypertension in the areas of ulceration. The 27 patients had 32 modified Linton procedures. Five had bilateral procedures. At the time of operation, 18 limbs had medial malleolar ulcers, five had bimalleolar ulcers, four had lateral ulcers, three had posterior ulcers, and two patients were free of ulcer. Medial incisions were used in 20 limbs, lateral incisions in six, medial and lateral incisions in three, and midposterior incisions in three. Split-thickness skin grafts were placed on six limbs the day of surgery and on 22 limbs 4 to 7 days later. Postoperative complications included deep venous thrombosis in two, partial flap necrosis in three, and cellulitis of the lower leg in three patients. Follow-up has ranged from 6 months to 10 years. During the most recent clinic visits, 21 limbs were completely healed, whereas six limbs had a recurrence of the ulcer. Five patients have been lost to follow-up. The good long-term results in 78% of the cases indicate that patients with recurrent venous stasis ulcers may receive lasting benefit from modified Linton procedures.",

    "abstract": "Controversy has surrounded the role of local hypothermia as a preoperative treatment in amputations of the lower extremity. A study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of amputation under cryoanesthesia in decreasing postoperative morbidity and mortality in below-knee (BK) amputations. Of 154 BK amputations, only 91 with unreconstructable vascular disease, gangrene, or both, were included in this study. Group I consisted of 48 patients (mean age 63.9 years) who had undergone a routine BK amputation; group II consisted of 43 patients (mean age 65.7 years) who were acutely ill and too unstable to undergo a major surgical procedure. Group II patients were treated by amputation while under cryoanesthesia before any definitive operative intervention. The patients in group II were significantly (p less than 0.05) more ill preoperatively than those in group I. Group II patients had a higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, diabetes mellitus, osteomyelitis, and wet gangrene. Seventy percent of the patients in group II had three or more risk factors vs. 46% in group I. Early postoperative mortality rates did not differ significantly between groups (group I, 8%; group II, 9%); the average length of hospital stay for group I patients was 24.2 days compared with 17.7 days in group II. Group II patients sustained slightly more postoperative complications. Amputation under cryoanesthesia appears to be of value in reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality and length of hospital stay in the acutely ill patient with unreconstructable vascular disease, gangrene, or both.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed (1) to determine the load on polypropylene (Prolene) sutures when used to close a longitudinal carotid arteriotomy and (2) to compare that load with the tensile strength of the suture material. Laboratory methods were used to determine the stress caused by pressure, the surgeon's knot, and that resulting from longitudinal extension of the sutured vessel. Results showed that the stress from the surgeon's knot accounts for more than 95% of total load on the suture, the remainder resulting from pressure and geometry. At 100 mm Hg in a 10 mm carotid artery at in situ length, 5-0 Prolene suture is loaded to 22%, 6-0 to 32%, and 7-0 to 42% of their respective breaking stresses. When the cervical spine is hyperextended, the carotid artery is stretched up to 6%. When the sutured pressurized vessel is extended 6%, 5-0 Prolene suture is loaded to 51%, 6-0 to 52%, and 7-0 to 75% of breaking stresses. These data suggest that 5-0 and 6-0 Prolene sutures should be used in preference to 7-0 sutures to close a carotid arteriotomy.",

    "abstract": "We compared the mechanical integrity of microvascular anastomoses created with a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser with conventional suture anastomoses. Seventy rat femoral artery segments (35 lased and 35 sutured) were harvested at 1, 24, and 72 hours, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. These segments were subjected to increasingly higher in vitro intraluminal hydrostatic pressures (bursting pressure). Conventionally sutured anastomoses exhibited significantly increased ability (p less than 0.05) to withstand greater bursting pressures than the laser-welded tissue up to 3 weeks postoperatively. After the third postoperative week, the laser anastomoses demonstrated increased bursting pressures compared with the conventional anastomoses. At the end of the 12-week period both groups demonstrated an ability to withstand supraphysiologic pressures in excess of 2000 mm Hg.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysm formation is a known complication of peripheral arterial access procedures. Although standard contrast angiography has been considered the diagnostic study of choice to identify pseudoaneurysms, isotope angiography has been described as an alternative method. In this study, we examined the role of 99mTc-tagged red blood cell scans in the diagnosis of traumatic pseudoaneurysm. Forty patients underwent scans; 25 scans were reported as abnormal and 15 as normal. There were no false-negative results; one scan had false-positive results (2.5%). The presence of pseudoaneurysm among the patients with abnormal scans was verified at operation in 23 of 25 patients. The one false-positive test was verified by ultrasound. All patients with normal scans were followed up for verification. Follow-up time ranged from 2 to 28 months. Radionuclide vascular flow study appears to give information similar to that of conventional angiography. With a series false-positive rate of 2.5%, the examination has a high specificity. The 99mTc-tagged red blood cell scan is a viable alternative to conventional angiography for the diagnosis of traumatic pseudoaneurysms and is associated with less radiation and morbidity.",

    "abstract": "We studied the relationships among intimal plaque area, lumen area, and artery size in 481 sections of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery taken at four standard sampling sites in 125 pressure-perfusion-fixed postmortem adult human hearts. The internal elastic lamina area was considered to be a measure of artery size or potential lumen area. Artery size correlated strongly with intimal plaque area at each LAD level (p less than 0.0001). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that plaque area was the principal determinant of artery size at each LAD level (r2 = 0.20 to 0.33). Sections of arteries with the most intimal plaque (highest quartile) were compared with those with the least plaque (lowest quartile) at each sample site. In the proximal LAD artery, the most severely diseased arteries increased in size 62% but lumen area decreased 25%. In the midportion of the LAD artery, plaque area was 10 times greater in the most diseased arteries, but lumen area remained normal because of an 80% increase in artery size. In the most severely diseased distal LAD artery sections, despite a fourteenfold increase in plaque area, lumen area almost doubled because of a marked increase in artery size. If no enlargement had occurred, the most severely diseased arteries in the proximal LAD segment would have developed a 92% lumen stenosis rather than the observed 25% lumen stenosis. In the distal LAD artery, without enlargement there would have been a 65% lumen stenosis rather than the 85% increase in lumen area that was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Preoperative angiography is widely used to estimate runoff before peripheral vascular bypass surgery. The Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards for the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery recently proposed an angiographic scoring system that grades the quality of vessels distal to the proposed bypass site and calculates an overall runoff score after adjusting each vessel score by an arbitrary weighting factor. We compared this score with intraoperatively measured runoff resistance in 67 patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass. Correlation between overall runoff score and measured resistance varied with the distal bypass site and was reasonably predictive for femoropopliteal above-knee bypasses (r = 0.67, p = 0.004, N = 17) and femoroposterior tibial bypasses (r = 0.73, p = 0.03, N = 9), but not for femoropopliteal below-knee (r = 0.05, p = 0.76, N = 34) or femoroperoneal (r = 0.57, p = 0.18, N = 7) bypasses. When multiple linear regression was used to calculate the weighting factors (rather than using arbitrarily assigned factors), the correlation between overall angiogram score and measured resistance improved substantially for femoropopliteal above-knee (r = 0.85, p = 0.00006), femoropopliteal below-knee (r = 0.50, p = 0.03) and femoroperoneal (r = 0.83, p = 0.02) bypasses. Correlation for the entire group of 67 patients improved from r = 0.30 (p = 0.02) to r = 0.64 (p = 0.0001). We conclude that the committee's scoring system correlates with measured runoff resistance but can be improved by the use of multiple linear regression to calculate weighting factors for each vessel in the outflow tract.",

    "abstract": "In many centers the standard treatment for venous stasis ulcers consists of UB dressings. A new dressing, DuoDERM hydroactive dressing (HD), has recently been used extensively for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers. Because of this trend, a prospective, randomized trial of these two dressings was undertaken. Sixty-nine ulcers (39 HD and 30 UB) were randomized. End points were complete healing and development of complications necessitating cessation of treatment. Time to healing, cost of treatment, and patient convenience were also evaluated. Twenty-one of 30 ulcers (70%) healed with UB therapy compared with 15 of 39 ulcers (38%) treated with HD (p less than 0.01, CST). Life-table healing rates at 15 weeks were 64% for UB compared with 35% for HD (p = 0.01, log rank test). Ten of 39 patients (26%) receiving HD had complications compared with no complications in the UB group (p = 0.004, FET). For those patients whose ulcers healed, there was no significant difference (p = 0.51, STT) in the mean time required for healing or the average weekly cost of dressing materials between the HD group (7.0 weeks at +11.50 per week) and the UB group (8.4 weeks at +12.60 per week). Those patients treated with HD reported a significantly greater level of convenience than those patients with UB (p = 0.004, STT). Although treatment with HD led to better patient acceptance, those patients receiving UB therapy had a significantly greater rate of healing and a significantly lesser incidence of complications than those patients treated with HD.",

Both the aortoiliac and the superior mesenteric arteries were treated by resection and reconstruction. Within one year after this operation, fibrodysplastic aneurysms developed in previously angiographically normal visceral arteries. The patient came to us with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by rupture of a visceral fibrodysplastic aneurysm of the middle colic artery into the transverse colon. The classification, the origin, the localization, and the natural history of fibrodysplasia are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic assessment of aortoiliac occlusive disease is necessary for successful arterial reconstruction of the aorta and legs. Various methods have been proposed and \"pull-through\" intra-arterial pressures are the \"gold standard.\" Deep Doppler duplex imaging was supplemented with real-time spectral analysis and velocity measurements in 29 cases. Twenty-three of these patients needed arteriography. One hundred sixty-six (166) arterial segments extending from the proximal aorta to the common femoral arteries were independently graded on duplex scans and arteriograms. For severe occlusive disease, duplex scanning is highly accurate (sensitivity 82%, specificity 93%). Velocity measurements were useful in determining the hemodynamic significance of stenoses. Peak systolic velocities in stenoses were measured with a duplex scanner. The pressure gradient calculated with the modified Bernoulli equation (delta P = 4Vmax2) correlated well with the gradients measured during arteriography (r = 0.9, n = 11). These noninvasive velocity measurements and Bernoulli calculations alert arteriographers to obtain special views of suspected areas and suggest the need for \"pull-through\" pressures and possible balloon angioplasty. In addition, these noninvasive measurements are useful to follow up patients who have mild to moderate aortoiliac disease and after angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Other than review of clinical experience, no assay exists that can reliably predict the long-term potential for aneurysm formation in an arterial prosthesis of biologic origin. Since mural degeneration probably results from proteolytic digestion, an in vitro assay was devised that used graft perfusion with 1% collagenase to induce rapid changes in mechanical properties. The effect of enzyme on graft diameter, compliance, permeability, and burst pressure was measured in ficin-digested, adipoyl chloride and glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine carotid artery and glutaraldehyde-tanned human umbilical vein. Both grafts have recently been reported to have a significant incidence of aneurysm within several years of implantation. Compliance and diameter were also measured noninvasively in patients with bovine carotid artery and human umbilical vein for more than 40 weeks after implantation. In vitro, the response to enzyme could be categorized into three groups. In group III, a diameter increase of more than 14% was associated with a significantly decreased compliance, and this paralleled the results found in aneurysmal grafts in vivo. In both grafts there was a strong correlation between postenzyme compliance change and initial compliance, loss of compliance being significantly greater in grafts with group III responses (p less than 0.01). This response may be a good predictor of a graft's overall susceptibility to aneurysmal degeneration, and initial compliance measurement may effectively identify inadequate fixation. Thus measurement of compliance may prove useful in quality control of a fixation process used in mass production. In conclusion, measurement of mechanical properties of biologic vascular grafts before and after collagenase exposure forms the basis for an effective in vitro assay of aneurysm susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "There has been a resurgence of interest in the concept of presealing high-porosity knitted Dacron prostheses with an absorbable biologic material. Such a material should provide reliable porosity control, preferably reducing water porosity from 2000 ml/cm2/min to less than 50 ml/cm2/min. It should not interfere with the fibrous and vascular ingrowth that securely anchors the developing pseudointima. In previous studies, we have examined fibrin glue and two forms of aldehyde cross-linked insoluble collagen used as Dacron sealants. We concluded that delayed resorption of the sealant as seen with glutaraldehyde cross-linked insoluble collagen results in undesirable healing characteristics, particularly lack of adhesion between pseudointima and the luminal surface of a prosthesis. This study examines a new sealant. Soluble collagen (gelatin) is treated to reduce the number of free amino groups available for aldehyde cross-linking. It is then weakly cross-linked with an aldehyde mixture and applied to a knitted Dacron prosthesis. Water porosity studies have confirmed satisfactory porosity control. Both rat subcutaneous and canine circulatory implants for 6 months reveal relatively rapid and complete sealant resorption without undesirable modification of the normal healing process of knitted Dacron.",

    "abstract": "In earlier studies, we have shown that porous (60 micron internodal distance) PTFE grafts develop a complete endothelial layer 2 weeks after being implanted in baboons. Subsequently, the intima of the graft thickens on account of SMC proliferation only where an overlying endothelial layer is present. SMCs in normal endothelialized artery proximal and distal to the graft show no detectable proliferation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility that growth factors released from the graft endothelium or SMCs regulate SMC proliferation. PTFE grafts (4 mm I.D., 60 micron internodal distance) were placed in the aortoiliac circulation of baboons and removed at 2 weeks. The grafts were perfused ex vivo with tissue culture medium (Ham's F12 + 25 mmol/L HEPES and 2% calf plasma-derived serum) at 2.5 ml/hr for 5 hours. Perfused native carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries served as controls. After this period of perfusion, graft and arterial endothelium was intact as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The mitogenic activity (thymidine incorporation) of the perfusates was measured in an assay with quiescent 3T3 cells and baboon aortic SMCs and corrected for the surface area of the perfused vessels. These studies demonstrated markedly increased mitogenic activity in the perfusates of grafts compared with perfusates of native vessels. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the vascular wall cells in healing grafts can produce factors that regulate smooth muscle cell growth.",

    "abstract": "Physical and biochemical forces exist that are necessary for the persistent attachment and function of ECs on native and prosthetic blood vessels. The optimization of conditions that permit regeneration of these attachment forces may allow rapid establishment of a durable, biocompatible EC monolayer. We examined the effects of three major factors, protein substrate, EC incubation time, and shear stress, on the attachment kinetics of human adult ECs to two different polymers. ECs were incubated up to 30 minutes on polymers (PS or PET) coated with extracellular matrix proteins: collagen I/III, fibronectin, collagen IV/V, laminin, gelatin, or saline control. After incubation, continued attachment in the presence of shear stress (created in a rotating disc device) between zero and 90 dynes/cm2 for 30 minutes was evaluated. Maximal adherence was observed on all substrates by 30 minutes. Therefore, after a 30-minute incubation, the percentage of cells attached (postshear ECs/preshear ECs/preshear ECs X 100) was measured as a function of shear stress. ECs attached to a matrix of fibronectin or collagen I/III demonstrated shear-resistant adherence after as little as 5 minutes of static incubation before initial shear exposure. By 30 minutes, more than 90% of the ECs on both matrices demonstrated the ability to remain attached in the presence of 90 dynes/cm2 of shear stress. We conclude that forces that attach ECs to surfaces are affected by temporal factors (incubation time) and substrate composition and may be quantified with a defined shear stress detachment assay. Understanding and manipulating these temporal physiochemical parameters should allow one to re-create an optimal EC monolayer on a blood-contacting surface.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle injury after revascularization (ischemia-reperfusion) continues to be a major clinical problem. Although heparinization has been recommended, its action in an experimental model of I-R has not been evaluated. We investigated the ability of heparinization to decrease I-R injury in 10 anesthetized dogs (nonheparinized, n = 5; heparinized, n = 5), subjecting one gracilis muscle to 6 hours of ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion while the identically prepared contralateral muscle served as a nonischemic control. Skeletal muscle infarction was determined by Tc-PYP uptake. Endothelial permeability was quantified by measurement of skeletal muscle 125I-Alb activity after intravenous injection. Interstitial hydrogen ion (H+) accumulation was determined by a miniature pH electrode inserted into the gracilis muscle. Isotopic activities from the ischemic muscle were calculated as a percentage of the contralateral nonischemic muscle (mean +/- SEM). Nonheparinized ischemic muscles had an increase in the activities of Tc-PYP and 125I-Alb of 684% +/- 149% and 742% +/- 130%, which were reduced to 218% +/- 54% and 378% +/- 85% by heparinization, respectively (p less than 0.05). During ischemia, the nonheparinized muscles accumulated 1223 +/- 121 nmol of H+ compared with 785 +/- 95 nmol in the heparinized animals (p less than 0.01). This significant reduction in I-R injury may be causally related to diminished endothelial permeability and H+ accumulation.",

We compared saline solution vs blood on prostanoid production and maintenance of endothelium in canine veins after 1 hour of storage at 23 degrees C with 0.2 mg/ml of papaverine. Spontaneous and arachidonate-stimulated prostaglandin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Endothelial integrity was analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Prostaglandin production in blood vs that in saline solution was 1821 +/- 1264 and 1259 +/- 719 pg/cm2/min at control and 6705 +/- 3702 vs 6264 +/- 3409 pg/cm2/min, respectively, after stimulation. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at any time point. Thromboxane levels were also indistinguishable between groups. Microscopy revealed 70% endothelial loss in blood vs 95% for saline solution. We conclude that endothelial preservation is enhanced by blood storage, that the medial layer produces substantial amounts of prostacyclin, and that additional storage solutions need to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "A prospective study was performed between May 1982 and March 1987 to assess the value of intraoperative prereconstruction angiography (IPA) in limb salvage. Eligibility was limited to patients with rest pain, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene limited to the toes: only candidates for infrapopliteal bypass were included. Seventy-eight such patients were examined with preoperative angiography. Delayed films, selective catheterization, reactive hyperemia, or vasodilators were used routinely. In only 11 of 78 patients (14%) was the runoff adequately visualized, demonstrating the tibial vessels and the pedal arch. The remaining 67 patients (86%) (with nonreconstructable disease by currently accepted outflow criteria) had surgical exposure of a tibial or pedal artery for IPA. In 56 of these patients (84%) good runoff was demonstrated and bypass was performed. The reconstruction rate was 86% (67 of 78 patients), significantly higher than the 33% rate reported by others. The operative mortality rate was 2.8% (2 of 78 patients). We concluded that in severe ischemia preoperative angiography is often inadequate in demonstrating runoff, even with adjunctive measures to dilate the outflow vessels. IPA through the tibial and pedal vessels eliminates all of the proximal vascular resistance, thereby providing a \"completion angiogram\" before reconstruction. This in turn extends reconstructability to many patients who would otherwise undergo primary amputation.",

    "abstract": "Vascular prosthetic grafts become more resistant to infection as the interval between implantation and bacteremic challenge increases. Endothelial cell (EC) seeding of such grafts has been shown to improve measurably their ability to resist a bacteremic challenge several weeks after implantation, presumably by reducing the amount of thrombus-free area (TFA) on their luminal surface. However, no investigators have reported the impact of EC seeding on the ability of chronically implanted vascular prostheses to resist a late bacteremic challenge. Bilateral common carotid interposition grafts were placed in 15 adult mongrel dogs with a 4 mm internal diameter, experimental, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prosthesis. One animal died shortly after operation and the grafts in two dogs thrombosed, thereby leaving 12 animals with at least one patent graft for subsequent study. At a mean interval of 45 weeks after implantation, five dogs (seven patent grafts) were challenged with an intravenous infusion of 3 X 10(8) radiolabeled Staphylococcus aureus; bacterial adherence and the TFA of the graft's luminal surface were determined for each of the patent grafts. There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial adherence or TFA between EC-seeded and control grafts. At a mean interval of 53 weeks after implantation, the remaining seven dogs (14 patent grafts) received a similar bacterial infusion and the animals were allowed to recover. Five days later, the grafts were harvested and cultured. Once again, there was no significant difference in the infectibility of EC-seeded vs. control grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide pressure (PO2 and PCO2) foot monitoring was compared with ankle Doppler-derived systolic pressure regarding their respective abilities to discriminate the severity of limb ischemia before vascular reconstruction and to predict surgical outcome early in the postoperative period. Transcutaneous PO2 (tcPCO2), foot-chest tcPO2 index, transcutaneous PCO2 (tcPCO2), foot tcPO2/tcPCO2 index (tcPO2/tcPCO2), ankle Doppler systolic pressure (AP), and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) were determined in 89 revascularized limbs. The measurement of tcPO2 and foot-chest tcPO2 was found to be more sensitive to degrees of severity of limb ischemia and more closely associated with the outcome of revascularization than AP and ABI. TcPCO2 and tcPO2/tcPCO2 were not useful in assessment of the vascular patient undergoing reconstructive surgery. Before operation, tcPO2 less than or equal to 22 torr and foot-chest tcPO2 less than or equal to 0.46 indicate severe limb ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. After operation, tcPO2 less than or equal to 22 torr and foot-chest tcPO2 index less than or equal to 0.53 indicate that revascularization is likely to fail. We conclude that tcPO2 monitoring, as a metabolic test of actual tissue perfusion, is a more reliable indicator of preoperative limb ischemia and postoperative outcome of revascularization than hemodynamic, Doppler-derived pressure tests.",

    "abstract": "Arterial stenosis occurring after balloon catheter embolectomy may be caused by myointimal hyperplasia (MIH). This study investigated the effects of shear force and repeated catheter withdrawals on the development of MIH after embolectomy. The procedures were performed in the common carotid and common femoral arteries of 18 anesthetized dogs. During catheter withdrawal, the balloons were filled gradually to produce shear forces rising smoothly from 50 to 200 gm. Four weeks after embolectomy, the vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ with 2% glutaraldehyde and were excised. The thickness and circumferential extent of MIH were measured in cross sections from segments of the vessels exposed to shear forces of 50, 100, and 200 gm. Sixty-nine of 72 arteries remained patent. Low shear force (50 gm) consistently elicited less MIH than did higher shear forces (p less than 0.05). At each level of shear force, repeated withdrawals resulted in greater circumferential extent of MIH than did single withdrawals (p less than 0.005).

    "abstract": "Most complications of embolectomy with the Fogarty balloon catheter are recognized early and have received ample attention in the surgical and radiologic literature. However, the delayed complication of diffuse arterial narrowing causing severe ischemia has received little emphasis, perhaps because follow-up arteriography is not always performed. This report describes five patients--women 43 to 62 years of age--with progressive leg ischemia discovered 2 to 4 months after embolectomy with the balloon catheter. Angiography showed a characteristic pattern of severe, smooth narrowing of that portion of the artery in which balloon embolectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of arterial specimens, available in two of the five patients, revealed marked intimal cellular proliferation, which narrowed the arteries severely without evidence of thrombosis, significant atheromatosis, or active arteritis. The cause appears to be intimal damage by the balloon. Embolectomy with the balloon catheter should be done especially carefully in relatively young women.",

    "abstract": "The blood-surface interface of 12 mm ID x 5 cm ePTFE vena cava conduits, unseeded (n = 8) and seeded (n = 8) with enzymatically derived autologous endothelial cells, was studied in a canine model at 4 and 12 weeks after graft implantation. Acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg each day) and Coumadin (prothrombin time 1.4 to 1.7 times the control value) were administered preoperatively and continued 4 weeks postoperatively. Platelets labeled with 111In and 125I-labeled fibrinogen were administered 24 hours before graft removal. Luminal platelet adherence, expressed as 10(6) platelets/cm2 of graft surface, was 8.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 56.4 +/- 8.0 (p less than 0.008) and 4.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 12.4 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.005) in seeded vs. unseeded grafts at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Luminal fibrinogen deposition, expressed in micrograms per square centimeter of graft surface, was 11.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 32.0 +/- 2.0 (p less than 0.06) and 6.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 12.4 +/- 6.3 (p less than 0.005) in seeded vs. unseeded grafts at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Cumulative 4- and 12-week luminal production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from seeded and unseeded grafts represented 11% and 5%, respectively, of that produced from the native iliac vein. Luminal endothelial cell coverage was 71% +/- 22% vs. 33% +/- 9% and 79% +/- 8% vs. 55% +/- 8% (p less than 0.05) in seeded and unseeded grafts at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively.

TxA2 and PGI2 concentrations were determined in 22 patients before, during, and after arterial reconstruction for limb salvage and in 10 control subjects. Control samples and preoperative patient samples had no detectable TxA2 or PGI2 (less than 26 pg/ml). Five minutes after reperfusion TxA2 increased (TxA2 = 76.27 +/- 48.9 pg/ml, mean +/- SEM) and persisted at 1 day (TxA2 = 190.1 +/- 80.1 pg/ml), 2 days (TxA2 = 224.7 +/- 131.7 pg/ml), 5 days (TxA2 = 334.8 +/- 272.8 pg/ml), and 7 days postoperatively (TxA2 = 256.6 +/- 149.0 pg/ml). Elevated TxA2 production was not associated with chronic ischemia of peripheral vascular disease. Reperfusion of the severely ischemic limb caused significant TxA2 release.",

    "abstract": "The response of canine platelets to arachidonic acid (AA) stimulation was studied as a predictor of thrombotic potential. Fifty mongrel dogs underwent in vitro platelet aggregation studies with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and AA used as inducing agents. Thirty-two dogs were selected on the basis of their response to AA stimulation. Platelet aggregation in response to AA stimulation occurred in 16 (responders) and 16 showed no aggregatory response (nonresponders). The animals were divided into four groups. Group I received no antiplatelet agents (control); group II received U-63,557A, a specific thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (TSI); group III received aspirin; and group IV received aspirin and TSI. Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were implanted in the carotid and femoral arteries of the dogs in all four groups. Plasma thromboxane (TxB2) levels were drawn before drug treatment and 4 weeks after surgery. Platelet deposition on the luminal surface of the implanted grafts was studied in vivo with a technique that uses both 111In-labeled platelets and 99mTc-labeled red blood cells and was expressed as percentage of indium excess (%IE). Group I (control) dogs whose platelets aggregated in response to AA stimulation had significantly higher 24-hour platelet deposition (%IE) on the luminal surface of implanted grafts (p less than 0.02), lower 4-week graft patency (p less than 0.002), and higher plasma TxB2 levels (p less than 0.01) than those dogs whose platelets did not aggregate. In contrast to the results of AA stimulation, neither ADP nor collagen responsiveness was discriminatory for the thrombotic potential of canine arteries as measured by 24-hour platelet deposition (%IE), 4-week graft patency, or plasma TxB2 levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The laser has been shown to vaporize arterial atheromatous plaque, but little information is available about its effect on various vascular materials. This study attempts to determine a safe margin for laser graft thrombectomy. An 18 watt argon laser with a 2 mm metal-encased sapphire tip fiberoptic system was used. Specimens such as autogenous vein, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and Dacron grafts as well as polypropylene and PTFE sutures were harvested from amputated human legs. Laser energy was delivered from the tip of the fiberoptic system while perpendicular to and in direct contact with these materials. The effects were examined histologically and compared by determining the bursting pressure of the grafts and the breaking strength of the sutures. The results indicate that seven sections of autogenous vein grafts and 11 sections of PTFE grafts were perforated by laser delivery of 32.9 +/- 9.9 and 50.0 +/- 7.1 joules, respectively, whereas two sections of Dacron grafts were easily perforated after only 10 joules was delivered. The bursting pressure of PTFE and autogenous vein grafts after laser application was determined to be more than 300 mm Hg. The breaking strength of 6-0 PTFE sutures was compared before and after receiving 200 joules by contact laser application. No significant difference was found; in a before laser application the breaking strength was 585.0 +/- 9.6 gm compared with 560.0 +/- 16.4 gm after laser application (n = 4, p greater than 0.1). However, 6-0 polypropylene sutures were easily melted after receiving 10 joules of laser energy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Clinical use of laser angioplasty is limited by the lack of an adequate guidance system. As a first step toward developing a reliable guidance system, laser-induced surface fluorescence and a fluorescent probe were used to differentiate plaque from normal arterial wall. The aortas from four normal New Zealand white rabbits and six atherosclerotic rabbits were studied in vitro. Rabbits from each group received 2.5 mg/kg of hematoporphyrin derivative intravenously 24 hours before death. Segments of the aortas were irradiated with a helium-cadmium laser, and the tissue surface fluorescence spectra were recorded with an optical multichannel analyzer. A plaque index, based on the resulting spectra, was calculated for each specimen of aorta. The spectra from normal aorta without hematoporphyrin derivative, normal aorta with hematoporphyrin derivative, and from plaque of atherosclerotic rabbits without hematoporphyrin derivative showed the same wavelength dependence. The plaque index values were not significantly different from one another. However, in plaque from atherosclerotic rabbits given hematoporphyrin derivative, the spectrum was markedly different, showing a broad spectral peak at 632 nm. This spectral peak corresponds to the spectral peak of hematoporphyrin derivative and was only seen in the plaque of atherosclerotic rabbits given hematoporphyrin derivative. The plaque index for these specimens was significantly different from all other specimens (p less than 0.001). This difference in fluorescence spectra and plaque index could be incorporated into a guidance system for laser angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "To better understand renal and systemic hemodynamics associated with hindquarter ischemia produced by aortic compression, chloralose-anesthetized dogs were given phentolamine while an external clamp maintained infrarenal aortic pressure below 25 mm Hg for 45 minutes. In four sham-operated dogs, infrarenal pressure was maintained; reinforced cannulas, capable of resisting clamp compression, were placed within the aorta and the inferior vena cava. Suprarenal and infrarenal arterial pressure and renal blood flow were continuously monitored. Blood samples taken before clamp application and at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after clamp removal were assayed for adenosine, inosine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine. On clamp removal suprarenal pressure immediately dropped from a preclamp pressure of 114 to 82 mm Hg but returned to preclamp values within 1 minute. Renal blood flow was significantly reduced after clamp release, reaching a nadir of 39% of preclamp flow. This reduction persisted despite a normalization of arterial pressure. Summed plasma purines were significantly elevated 1 minute after clamp removal. Sham-operated dogs showed no significant alterations in arterial pressure, renal blood flow, or plasma purine levels. This study demonstrates a significant non-alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated reduction in renal blood flow and a coincident increase in purine degradation products after removal of an infrarenal aortic cross-clamp.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal vascular injuries account for 25% to 30% of all vascular injuries seen in urban trauma centers where penetrating wounds are the most common cause of trauma. Patients have moderate hypotension if contained hematomas are present and present in extremis with massive abdominal distension, if hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity is occurring. Injuries occur in five areas, each containing its own vessels and techniques of exposure and vascular repair. Included are the midline supramesocolic, midline inframesocolic, lateral perirenal, lateral pelvic, and portal areas. In these areas, arterial repair is essentially always attempted, whereas ligation of major veins, if necessary, is well tolerated in many instances. Survival depends on the number and magnitude of associated vascular and visceral injuries. If an operation can be performed soon after injury, survival with most major abdominal arterial injuries ranges from 35% to 85%. When major abdominal venous injuries are considered, the survival rate ranges from 50% to 95%. Postoperative complications include thrombosis of repairs, dehiscence of suture lines, and infection. Second-look operations may be beneficial to evaluate tenuous repairs, whereas various techniques are helpful in avoiding suture line breakdowns as a result of infection.",

    "abstract": "Different segments of the aorta and its branches show differing susceptibilities to atherosclerosis. To identify metabolic features that may account for plaque formation and sparing, we studied aortic wall respiration and glycolysis proximal and distal to an aortic coarctation in 30 rabbits fed a standard or atherogenic diet. Three months after coarctation, blood pressure in the proximal aorta was elevated, and plaque occupied 98% +/- 28% of the intimal surface compared with 57% +/- 26% for control animals (p less than 0.05). Aortic pressure distal to the stenosis remained normal, but plaque formation was markedly decreased (5% +/- 4%) compared with controls (30% +/- 27%, p less than 0.05). Metabolic studies included measurement of oxygen consumption of proximal and distal aortic walls, lactic acid production, and 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Elevated pressure or hyperlipidemia increased respiration (22.6 +/- 4.0 or 16.3 +/- 6.0 pmol oxygen consumed/min/microgram deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] vs 5.8 +/- 5.2 for controls; p values less than 0.05) without increasing glycolytic metabolism. The coexistence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia resulted in maximal plaque formation and a sevenfold increase in both oxidative metabolism (46.6 +/- 27.2 pmol oxygen consumed/min/microgram DNA vs 5.8 +/- 5.2 for controls, p less than 0.004) and glycolytic metabolism (44 +/- 10 ng lactic acid produced/90 min/microgram DNA vs 6 +/- 3 for controls, p less than 0.004). In the spared aortic segment distal to coarctation, glycolytic metabolism was increased (10 +/- 8 ng lactic acid produced/90 min/microgram DNA vs 2 +/- 1 for controls, p less than 0.05) but oxidative metabolism remained normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Forty-nine bypasses originating from the distal superficial femoral artery or popliteal artery in 46 patients were reviewed to examine late patency, limb salvage, and factors leading to graft failure. Operations were performed because of tissue loss in 86%, rest pain in 12%, and limiting claudication in 2% of limbs. Proximal anastomosis was from the distal superficial femoral artery in 12% and the popliteal artery in 88%. Distal anastomosis was to the below-knee popliteal artery or proximal tibial vessels in 20% and the distal tibial vessels in 80%. Life-table analysis showed a primary patency rate of 83%, 62%, and 41%, at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The rate of limb salvage at 6 years for all grafts was 69%. Cox proportional hazards analysis determined that stenosis of 20% or greater in the proximal superficial femoral artery before bypass was a significant risk factor for graft failure (p = 0.02) despite the presence of normal intra-arterial pressure at the site of the proximal anastomosis at the time of bypass. Long-term survival in these patients was low, with a 6-year survival rate of only 24%. Infragenicular bypasses originating from the distal superficial femoral artery or the popliteal artery can be performed with patency and limb salvage rates comparable to bypasses originating from the common femoral artery. These bypasses are more likely to fail when performed in the presence of a stenosis 20% or greater in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery proximal to the graft origin.",

All patients received a heparin infusion after operation and were switched to warfarin before discharge to maintain coagulation parameters (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) approximately twice that of control subjects. Primary procedures were done in 14 patients (19%), and the remaining patients had one or more previous procedures. Ninety-seven percent of patients had limb-threatening ischemia. Graft patency was confirmed by interval examinations and Doppler ankle pressure measurements. The mean follow-up was 36 months, and long-term graft patency (4 years) was determined by life-table analysis. The 2-year cumulative patency rate for this group was 45% and the 4-year patency rate was 37%. The latter is significantly better than the patency rates of 12% reported for similar untreated randomized grafts. Anticoagulation was subtherapeutic in 15 patients at the time of graft thrombosis, and if these were excluded, the 2- and 4-year patency rates were 58% and 50%, respectively. Hematomas requiring drainage occurred in 10 patients (13.3%) and six patients (8%) developed wound infections, but graft infection occurred in only two patients. Two patients (2.6%) developed late bleeding complications necessitating cessation of the warfarin. There was one fatal perioperative myocardial infarction (1.3%) and four late deaths, none of which were related to the warfarin therapy. Although the incidence of postoperative hematoma and wound infection was increased, late complications occurred infrequently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "During a 2-year period 75 patients underwent 77 major lower extremity amputations for arterial insufficiency deemed untreatable by reconstruction (36 primary and 41 after failed infrainguinal arterial bypass). Patients with nonfunctional prosthetic grafts were randomized prospectively to either partial graft removal or complete graft removal, performed simultaneously with amputation, to determine which technique more effectively reduces delayed wound healing, stump infection, operative revision, and process-related death. Patients with known graft and deep wound infection were excluded from this review, as were patients who had positive graft cultures at the time of amputation. Partial graft removal resulted in an increased rate of delayed wound healing (47.8% vs 7.7%; chi 2 5.9, p less than 0.025) and secondary stump infection (39.1% vs 7.7%; chi 2 4.4, p less than 0.05), when compared with complete graft removal. The operative revision and process-related mortality rates were also higher in limbs that had partial graft removal, although not statistically significant. The operative morbidity and mortality rate was no greater in the group with complete graft removal, although the mean operative time was nearly doubled (1.4 vs 2.6 hours). Therefore we recommend that all nonfunctional prosthetic graft material be removed concomitant with major lower extremity amputation to avoid the excessive number of wound healing and suppurative complications that are encountered when residual graft material is present in the amputation stump.",

    "abstract": "Ten patients with heparin-coated pulmonary artery catheters had heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which persisted after all other sources of heparin were discontinued. The thrombocytopenia occurred in approximately 0.4% of the patients receiving heparin-coated catheters and remitted when the catheters were removed. The platelet counts averaged 59,000/mm3 at the time of the diagnosis and recovered to an average of 143,000/mm3 by 3 days (range 2 to 4 days) after removal of the heparin-coated catheters. One patient required a second catheter 31 days after the first catheter had been removed. When the second heparin-coated catheter was inserted, the platelet count decreased from 307,000/mm3 to 102,000/mm3 in 4 days. Segments of heparin-coated pulmonary artery catheters were placed in platelet-rich plasma and incubated with serum from patients with known heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies or with serum from volunteers with no exposure to heparin. The heparin-coated catheters induced platelet aggregation in all samples containing serum from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. However, platelet aggregation did not occur when the catheters were incubated with the serum of the volunteers. Non-heparin-coated catheters failed to produce platelet aggregation when incubated with either sera. The high mortality and morbidity rates associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia mandate that afflicted patients receive no more heparin, at least until the heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies are no longer detectable. Patients with heparin-coated catheters who have thrombocytopenia should be tested for the presence of heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies. If heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the catheters must be removed if the thrombocytopenia is to be reversed and complication avoided.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities of the fibrinolytic system can result in unusual or unexplained clotting that occurs spontaneously or after minor trauma. We identified five patients with limb-threatening arterial thrombosis of the upper extremity associated with either a low level of plasminogen or an abnormal immunoreactive plasminogen. All patients had extensive thrombosis of the brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries. Two patients had concomitant thrombus of the subclavian artery, which in one patient was associated with distal embolization to the hand. There was no evidence of atherosclerosis in any patient. Detection of an abnormal plasminogen level was done by immunoelectrophoresis of the patient's serum with antiplasminogen sera. In these patients a separate immunoreactive band located near the anode and distinct from the normal single plasminogen band was detected. Because of extensive thrombosis of the arterial system, exploration of the brachial artery, as well as the origin of all the forearm vessels, was necessary for complete balloon catheter thrombectomy. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent the catastrophic complication of arm or hand amputation. Patients with an abnormal plasminogen level should receive perioperative heparin therapy and long-term warfarin to prevent recurrent thrombotic episodes.",

    "abstract": "Lymphovenous anastomoses (LVA) offer ideal physiologic treatment for lymphedema, and our experimental data support late patency. Between Jan. 1, 1982, and April 1, 1986, 18 patients underwent operation for chronic lymphedema; LVA could be performed in 14 patients (10 women and four men). Six patients had secondary lymphedema of the upper extremity. One of eight patients with lymphedema of the lower extremity had filariasis, and seven had primary lymphedema. Mean follow-up was 36.6 months (range: 5 to 57 months). Limb circumference and volume, number of postoperative episodes of cellulitis, and lymphoscintigraphy were used to assess results. Improvement occurred in three upper extremities and two lower extremities. There was no change in five extremities, and in four patients the edema progressed. One patient with primary lymphedema and four of seven patients with secondary lymphedema improved. Only one of five patients benefited from one anastomosis; however, all patients with more than two anastomoses improved. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed in 10 patients. No lymphatic channel was visualized before operation in three patients, and at operation none was found. In four other patients lymph channels localized by lymphoscintigraphy were identified during operation. Significant improvement was documented by lymphoscintigraphy in one patient after operation, and this patient had permanent improvement 30 months later. Patients with primary lymphedema had disappointing results, but four of seven patients with secondary lymphedema benefited from LVA, especially if several anastomoses could be performed. Lymphoscintigraphy appears to be a suitable method of both identifying patent lymph channels before surgery and determining function of LVA after operation. However, presently objective data to prove the clinical efficacy of this operation are lacking.",

    "abstract": "A surgically created, totally autogenous venous valve has been devised that holds potential for the treatment of venous insufficiency. Valves were constructed from 2.7 cm long segments of canine external jugular veins. Through the use of intimal separation, folding, and suturing techniques, thin, pliable valves with an intimal lining were constructed and interposed in the canine superficial femoral vein. Fifteen valves were implanted in three groups of dogs. In group I (six dogs) the valves were immediately removed after implantation and subjected to various levels of hydrostatic pressure. In group 2 (six dogs) valves were removed after 1 week and examined for patency and competency. Group 3 animals (three dogs) were anticoagulated with subcutaneously administered heparin from implantation to removal at 7, 9, and 13 days. In group 1 valves were found to open at less than 3 cm of water and remain competent at 55 cm of water. Two of these valves subjected to 300 mm Hg pressure also remained competent. In the six group 2 dogs, two valves remained patent and competent, whereas four valves were patent but incompetent as a result of thrombus that prevented valve closure. In group 3 all valves were patent and competent at 7, 9, and 13 days after implantation. An autogenous venous valve that opens at physiologic pressures and remains competent at high pressures can be surgically created. The ability to remain competent at high pressures may give this valve an advantage over the repaired, transposed, or transplanted native venous valve in the treatment of chronic venous valvular insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "The success of bypass grafting for popliteal aneurysms may be compromised by the natural history of these lesions. During a 9-year period 35 patients had repair of 48 popliteal aneurysms. Elective repair was performed in 26 limbs and the remaining 22 limbs required urgent or emergent treatment after aneurysm thrombosis (16) or embolic digital ischemia (six). Retrospective review of preoperative and intraoperative arteriograms and CT or ultrasound scans was done to define the relationship of distal runoff anatomy to initial symptoms and long-term grafting success during a mean follow-up of 48 months. Only five of 48 limbs (10%) had three continuous tibial vessels and a patent pedal arch. Twenty-six limbs (55%) had one or no named calf vessels and 11 limbs had incomplete pedal arches. When thrombosis or symptomatic embolism occurred, the anatomy was significantly worse; 15 of 22 such limbs (68%) had one or no patent tibial vessels and seven had incomplete pedal arches. Nineteen of 28 aneurysms examined by CT or ultrasound scanning showed intraluminal thrombus. Eight of 13 patent aneurysms with intraluminal thrombus had one or no patent tibial vessels. The 5-year graft patency rate was 74% for the entire study group. Bypass for repair of asymptomatic aneurysms had a patency rate of 91% at 5 years vs 54% for symptomatic patients (p less than 0.05). Patients with popliteal aneurysms often have advanced tibial disease that appears worse in those with symptoms. The occurrence of a patent popliteal aneurysm with intraluminal thrombus and advanced runoff disease suggests that chronic microembolism may be an etiologic factor in the tibial disease observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Seventy-six limbs with clinically suspected acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were evaluated by means of ultrasonic imaging (UI) to define the ability of this technique to detect acute and chronic venous obstruction and to determine the origin and distribution of venous thrombi. UI was compared with ascending contrast phlebography in 46 limbs and was found to be 100% accurate in detecting both acute and chronic venous thrombosis. Overall, acute DVT was present in 63 of 76 limbs (83%) studied. Acute DVT was found in 24% and recurrent acute DVT in 76%. Our results indicate that although the calf veins are the most common site of involvement (89%), thrombi may frequently arise simultaneously in multiple anatomic sites. All limbs with recurrent acute DVT had evidence of previous calf thrombi but only 13% had previous proximal disease. This suggests that asymptomatic calf DVT is common and the prevalence of recurrent acute DVT is significantly greater than previously believed. We found UI is a practical, accurate, non-invasive method for investigating the pathogenesis of venous disease.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that bioresorbable vascular prostheses woven from lactide-glycolide copolymers and implanted into arteries of several animal models become replaced by cellular tissues; the rate of replacement parallels the kinetics of prosthetic resorption. This study evaluates the efficacy of bicomponent resorbable prostheses as a method of augmenting resistance to dilatation during the resorption period of the more rapidly resorbed component. Bicomponent prostheses (n = 37) were woven from compound yarns containing 74% polyglactin 910 (PG910) and 26% polydioxanone (PDS) and were interposed into adult white New Zealand rabbit infrarenal aortas. Resultant prosthesis-tissue complexes were harvested after 2 weeks to 12 months. Specimens were photographed and sectioned for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Randomly selected fresh explants at 1 and 3 months and control aortic segments from the same rabbits were simultaneously perfused with culture media (37 degrees C, 100/80 mm Hg, 60 ml/min) and perfusates assayed by means of tritiated radioimmunoassay techniques for the stable prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha before and after the addition of sodium arachidonate (10 micrograms/ml) to the media. Results showed 100% patency, no aneurysms, and stenosis in 1 of 37 prostheses (3%). PG910 was totally resorbed by 2 months and PDS by 6 months. By 1 month inner capsule thickness was 303 +/- 30 microns. In contrast to previous reports this was significantly thicker than that within 100% PDS (230 +/- 40 microns) and significantly less thick than in 100% PG910 (530 +/- 62 microns). Inner capsules in all three groups stabilized at similar thicknesses (417 to 502 microns).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In the first part of this experiment, the effects of pharmacotherapy on the neurologic consequences of transient global ischemia were examined in Wistar rats. The control and four experimental groups each contained six rats. In comparison to the control group receiving normal saline (NS) solution, in which no rats survived, all rats given naloxone (Nx) (23 mg/kg), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (10,000 U/kg), or allopurinol (APL) (35 mg/kg), 15 minutes before interruption of cerebral blood flow, survived the 20-minute period of global ischemia (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). No rat receiving deferoxamine (DEF) (20 mg/kg) survived the same ischemic period. In the second part of the experiment, the arachidonic acid (AA) content of brain samples was determined by gas chromatography and was used as an indicator of cerebral ischemia. Two control and four experimental groups consisted of six rats each. An ischemia control group received NS, whereas experimental groups were given Nx, SOD, APL, or DEF with the same previous dosage schedule. The animals were decapitated 15 minutes after drug infusion and cerebral ischemia was simulated by incubation of the heads in a 37 degrees C water bath for 60 minutes. AA content of ischemic brain treated with NS was markedly elevated (60.0 +/- 24.1 micrograms/gm of brain tissue), whereas in comparison the AA content of brain treated with Nx (5.1 +/- 3.0 micrograms/gm of brain tissue, p less than 0.05), SOD (3.5 +/- 2.7 micrograms/gm of brain tissue, p less than 0.05), or APL (2.9 +/- 1.5 micrograms/gm of brain tissue, p less than 0.05) all demonstrated much lower levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The operative management of extracranial cerebrovascular occlusive disease requires meticulous surgical technique. Intraoperative duplex imaging (10 MHz B-mode ultrasound combined with 7.5 MHz Doppler spectrum analysis) was used in an attempt to recognize technical problems that might result in serious neurologic injury. Eighty-four carotid arteries were studied in 76 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or reconstruction. Indications for operation included carotid territory transient ischemic attack (n = 36 [43%]), amaurosis fugax (n = 16 [19%]), stroke (n = 11 [13%]), asymptomatic stenosis (n = 11 [13%]), vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack (n = 7 [8%]), recurrent stenosis (n = 2 [2%]), and trauma (n = 1 [1%]). Arterial anatomy was assessed ultrasonographically and duplex-derived velocity measurements were obtained to assess hemodynamics. Increased velocity measurement was noted to correlate with ultrasound image of stenosis. Technical errors were identified in 17 patients (22%), including six persons with residual internal carotid artery stenoses, three persons with hemodynamically significant stenoses caused by \"kinked\" internal carotid arteries, eight persons with debris or intimal flaps in their external carotid arteries, and one person with an occluded external carotid artery. The intraoperative duplex scan led to corrective measures during the surgical procedure in eight patients (11%). No new ipsilateral brain injury was noted in the 76 patients postoperatively. Intraoperative duplex scanning accurately identified residual stenosis, intraluminal thrombus, and loose debris. Duplex scanning altered intraoperative decision making in a significant proportion of patients studied.",

    "abstract": "In situ saphenous vein bypass presents unique problems in wound management. A retrospective analysis of wound complications occurring after in situ bypass was undertaken in 93 patients who had 98 operations. For purposes of statistical analysis, only the first procedure was considered in patients having bilateral bypass. Fifty-nine percent of patients were male; the average age was 69 years. Medical risk factors surveyed included diabetes (64%), hypertension (52%), and smoking (53%). Ninety-one percent of the procedures were done for limb salvage; the mean ankle-brachial index was 0.43. Sixty percent of bypasses were infrapopliteal, and the mean duration of surgery was 4.6 hours. Continuous incision was used to expose the vein in 59% of cases. Skin closure was effected with staples in 44% and with sutures or both in the remainder. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 27 days. Wound problems developed in 31 cases, 11 of which were major. The thigh was the most common location. There was a significant association between continuous incision and anterior tibial bypass and wound complications. Anterior tibial bypass and staple closure were found to be independent predictors of wound problems with the use of stepwise logistic regression. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly prolonged; two bypasses failed and three lower extremities were amputated because of incisional complications. A discussion of the technical aspects of wound management is presented.",

    "abstract": "A review was undertaken of all patients seen in our institution between January 1978 and March 1987 in whom a cerebral CT scan was obtained in association with elective carotid endarterectomy. Three hundred fifty-nine such patients were identified. In a subgroup of 89 patients who were neurologically normal after carotid endarterectomy, scans were performed at least 48 hours after surgery to quantitate the incidence of silent postoperative infarction. These scans were interpreted by one neuroradiologist. Preoperative cerebral CT scans showed ipsilateral infarction in 146 of 359 patients (40.6%). Ipsilateral infarction was most common in patients with stroke (76%) but was also seen in 32.8% of patients with transient ischemic attacks, in 9 of 40 patients (22.5%) with nonhemispheric symptoms, and in 9 of 45 patients (20%) with asymptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis. The postoperative stroke rate was not significantly increased by the presence of infarct on preoperative cerebral CT scan (2.6% vs 1.9%). New infarcts were seen on cerebral CT scanning after carotid endarterectomy in 2 of 89 patients with no detectable neurologic abnormality (2.3%). This study demonstrates a high frequency of ipsilateral infarction in patients having elective carotid endarterectomy, even in those patients with clinical symptom complexes thought by many physicians to be relatively benign (i.e., transient cerebral ischemia, nonhemispheric ischemia, and asymptomatic carotid stenoses).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Two hundred forty-three bypasses to paramalleolar arteries were performed in 224 extremities of 208 patients since 1971; 166 were implanted in men (68%) and 77 in women (32%). The median age was 73 years. Gangrene (61%), nonhealing ulcer (15%), rest pain (22%), and trauma (2%) were the indications for bypass. Usual risk factors were noted: diabetes (65%), smoking (51%), heart disease (46%), and hypertension (45%). The extent of occlusive disease dictated three graft configurations: long grafts originating in arteries proximal to the adductor tendon (n = 111), short grafts originating at or below the popliteal artery (n = 88), and jump grafts originating near the distal end of a previous femorodistal bypass (n = 44). The association between diabetes (incidence 80%) and gangrene (75%) in patients with short grafts was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The 2-year secondary patency rate of long in situ grafts was 92% compared with 72% for other autogenous vein long grafts. The limb salvage rate for all autogenous vein long grafts was 90% at 3 years. The secondary patency rate at 3 years for short grafts was 81% and the limb salvage rate was 80%. There were four amputations with patent grafts. Primary and secondary patency rates of jump grafts were similar (53%), whereas the limb salvage rate was 89% at 2 years. Patency and limb salvage rates of rarely employed nonautogenous conduits were less than 35% at 1 year (long grafts). Bypass grafts to the ankle and foot are effective and durable and should be performed with autogenous vein.",

    "abstract": "Primitive embryonic anastomotic vessels between the internal carotid and basilar arterial systems occasionally persist into adult life. We encountered six such patients in a series of 765 carotid endarterectomies (0.8%). These arteries are named for the cranial nerves with which they run. The most commonly found vessel is the trigeminal artery, followed by the hypoglossal and proatlantal intersegmental arteries. The primitive otic artery is the rarest of the four anomalous vessels. These vessels are usually large and are associated with hypoplasia or aplasia of the normal intracranial anastomotic channels. Cerebral ischemia is common during temporary intraoperative carotid occlusion and was encountered in two of three patients who had intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring. Thus cerebral ischemia should be anticipated during carotid cross-clamping and cerebral protective measures should be instituted when persistent primitive cranial vessels are encountered.",

    "abstract": "Three cases are described of upper extremity ischemia occurring after the creation of fistulas (AVFs) (one case) and bridge AVFs (two cases) for hemodialysis access. All three cases were successfully treated with ligation of the artery immediately distal to the origin of the AVF in conjunction with a reversed saphenous vein bypass. The latter was constructed from the artery proximal to the origin of the fistula to the artery distal to the site of ligation. Preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic measurements and complete disappearance of symptoms indicated that this procedure corrected the ischemic steal phenomenon. Angioaccess function was not affected in these three cases, thereby allowing continuation of its use immediately after corrective surgery and for follow-up periods of 1 month, 6 months, and 8 years.",

    "abstract": "Hematocrit values, plasma fibrinogen levels, and erythrocyte deformability are well-recognized factors affecting blood viscosity. We studied the incidence of abnormalities in these factors among 17 patients suffering from thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) compared with 14 normal age- and sex-matched control subjects. Hematocrit values and fibrinogen levels were higher, whereas the erythrocyte filterability index was lower among the patients with Buerger's disease (p less than 0.001). Incubation of washed erythrocytes from these patients with control plasma of blood type AB produced an improvement of the filterability index (p less than 0.005). Our findings suggest that patients suffering from Buerger's disease show, in addition to the well-recognized arterial lesions, an abnormality in the factors affecting blood viscosity. This may contribute to a worsening of the clinical manifestations. Evidence is presented suggesting that a plasmatic factor may be responsible for the impaired erythrocyte filterability.",

In addition to fasciotomies and administration of mannitol, sodium hydrogen bicarbonate, and furosemide, we performed plasma exchanges on three occasions. The urine and serum concentrations of myoglobin fell from above 180.0 and 50.0 mg/dl, respectively, to 0.14 and 0.11 mg/dl after the third plasma exchange on the ninth day after admission. The serum creatinine concentration was normal on admission, peaked at 2.85 mg/dl, and returned to normal values at discharge. We suggest that plasma exchange may be considered an adjunct to conventional therapy of compartment syndrome with associated acute toxic nephropathy caused by myoglobinemia.",

    "abstract": "Heparin, an anticoagulant medication used therapeutically and prophylactically, may have thrombotic complications that are paradoxical in nature. There is growing awareness, as evidenced by recent reports, that heparin has a small but definite incidence of causing thrombocytopenia (6 to 8 days after initiation of therapy) associated with platelet aggregation causing intravascular thrombosis, with potentially devastating morbidity and mortality. We review this phenomenon and bring attention to a recent case that resulted in a 10 X 19 cm full-thickness skin necrosis of the thigh. This case clearly implicates heparin as the \"aggregating factor\" of platelets, resulting in intravascular thrombosis. No risk factors have been identified that place a patient at increased risk for this phenomenon. This disorder occurs in patients who have received all forms of heparin. Therefore all patients receiving heparin are considered at risk. Early recognition of thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin will alert the physician to this disorder.",

No associated disorders were discovered in this patient. The aneurysm was resected and a Dacron aortic graft was implanted. Nine years after operation the patient was in good health without evidence of other aneurysms. Thirty-two cases of probable congenital abdominal aortic aneurysms were collected from the literature. In 19 cases, the cause of aneurysm was not ascertained. We identified two groups of patients with probably congenital AAAs: type I congenital AAA, in which there is a generalized disorder of the arterial tissue and usually aneurysms are present in other areas and type II congenital AAA, in which there is a localized defect of the abdominal aorta, without aneurysms in other areas. We speculate that a congenital defect localized to the wall of the abdominal aorta was the cause of the aneurysm in this patient (type II congenital AAA).",

Tests in 84 patients were positive for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies by an abnormal rabbit brain neutralization procedure, positive for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies, or both. Twenty-three of these 84 patients had 51 separate surgical procedures, 18 vascular and 33 nonvascular. Four patients had 11 postoperative thrombotic complications (during same hospitalization), involving peripheral arteries in nine cases, vein in one, and coronary artery in one. Nine of the 18 vascular procedures were complicated by thrombosis, whereas only two of the 33 nonvascular procedures were complicated by thrombosis (p less than 0.025). Three of the seven patients who had a vascular procedure suffered multiple postoperative thrombotic complications, and ultimately all three required an amputation. At the time of these thrombotic complications, all three patients had not received any perioperative medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and/or corticosteroids). Further analysis revealed a correlation between preoperative medications and the lack of postoperative complications, suggesting that perioperative corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and/or antiplatelet agents may protect against postoperative thrombosis. We conclude that patients with the lupus anticoagulant having surgical procedures carry a significant risk of postoperative thrombotic complications, particularly after vascular procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The brachial artery is not used for long-term catheterization and routine hemodynamic monitoring because a high incidence of ischemic complications is anticipated. However, in a review of 157 patients who had 225 percutaneous transbrachial hepatic artery catheters placed for infusion of chemotherapeutic agents, catheters remained in situ from 1 day to 14 months (median 68 days). One hundred seventy-three catheters (77%) were removed electively and 52 catheters (23%) were removed because of complications. Diminution or loss of the radial pulses occurred on insertion of 88 catheters (39.1%) and 16 of these (8%) were removed after 24 hours because ischemic symptoms developed. Subsequently, 25 other catheters (11.1%) were removed because of complications such as paresthesia, eight (3.5%); brachial artery thrombosis, four (1.7%); microembolization, three (1.3%); claudication, two (0.8%); and pseudoaneurysm, one (0.4%). Seven catheters (3.1%) were removed because of a combination of pallor, diminished pulses, and muscle weakness. Hemorrhage from the arteriotomy site necessitated the removal of 11 other catheters (4.9%). Amputation, ischemic ulceration, major neuromuscular sequelae, and peripheral embolization to the head or lower limbs did not occur. This study suggests that long-term brachial artery catheterization is associated with a low incidence of permanent ischemic complications.",

    "abstract": "Nonpenetrating injury to the subclavian vessels is uncommon. During a 6-year period we have treated 167 patients with injuries to the subclavian and superior mediastinal arteries. Fifteen of these injuries (9%) occurred after blunt trauma. In 10 patients the proximal segment (first and second parts) of the artery was involved. No patient had an isolated injury; the most frequent associated injuries were rib fractures (n = 11), with the first rib being involved in four of these. Total brachial plexus disruption was found in nine patients. All patients with distal artery involvement had a clavicular fracture. All had an absent radial pulse and eight had critical ischemia of the hand. Four patients were treated nonoperatively and the remainder were treated along standard lines. Brachial plexus reconstruction was not feasible in any patient. Within 2 weeks of operation, one patient died as a result of head injuries and one required amputation because of sepsis. During a 12-month period, five regained full function, one additional patient requested above-elbow amputation after 6 months, and seven had a flail anesthetic limb. Twelve of these patients were involved in automobile accidents, eight of whom were wearing lap-shoulder harness seat belts with a loose-fitting shoulder strap component that created a characteristic abrasion pattern on the torso and chest. We conclude that the torsionshearing motion allowed by this situation contributed significantly to the pattern of injury and a plea is made for correctly fitted restraining devices.",

    "abstract": "Congenital vascular malformations (CVMs) of the limb include simple and cavernous hemangiomas, microarteriovenous and macroarteriovenous fistulas, venous angiomas, and mixed CVMs. In differentiating these lesions, Doppler waveform analysis, labeled microsphere studies, arteriography, closed-space phlebography, and contrast-enhanced CT scans have all been advocated, but each has significant limitations. This article evaluates the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in characterizing CVMs. Limb CVMs were evaluated by MRI in eight patients: four in the upper and four in the lower extremity. Before MRI, seven of the patients had arteriography, five had phlebography, and five had Doppler waveform analysis. MRI showed a highly cellular network with little arteriovenous flow in five patients. In four of these, arteriography and phlebography confirmed the presence of a predominantly venous or microfistulous anomaly. In the other three patients, MRI demonstrated high-flow arterial and venous channels and were confirmed by arteriography to have macrofistulous arteriovenous malformations. In all eight patients, MRI revealed the anatomic location and the longitudinal and transverse extent of the vascular malformation as well as their relationships with contiguous muscle groups, bones, and vessels. We conclude that CVMs of the limbs can be characterized accurately with MRI, with the anatomic extent, degree of cellularity, and flow characteristics readily gauged. Because MRI provides the same basic information supplied by angiography and the noninvasive laboratory and assesses anatomic extent and cellularity, it serves well as the primary diagnostic test for suspected CVMs, particularly in infants and children in whom competitive tests pose additional limitations.",

    "abstract": "To rapidly start systemic anticoagulation there are few alternatives to heparin; those that may be used are often less effective and are impractical substitutes for various reasons. We report the cases of seven patients in whom anticoagulant therapy was begun with ancrod instead of heparin for one or more of the following reasons: (1) failure to achieve systemic anticoagulation in response to heparin (e.g., antithrombin III deficiency), (2) heparin-associated complications (e.g., thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, or both), and (3) combined anticoagulation and improved blood rheology considered to be potentially more beneficial than anticoagulation alone (e.g., massive thrombosis). In the cases reported, ancrod permitted systemic anticoagulation equal to that of heparin; this was achieved without bleeding complications. In contrast to streptokinase or urokinase, ancrod does not degrade preformed, fully cross-linked thrombin fibrin; consequently hemorrhagic complications are uncommon. Ancrod appears to be an appropriate alternative to heparin and may be preferable to it in certain circumstances.",

    "abstract": "The blotchy mouse has an X chromosome mutation affecting crosslinking of collagen and elastin, which results in aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta. The age of onset, patterns of distribution, and histologic features of these lesions have not been characterized in detail in previous studies. Male normal and blotchy mice 1 to 8 months of age were killed and latex was injected into the left ventricles to facilitate exposure, examination, histologic sampling, and photography of the aorta. Aneurysms were not detected in any normal animals but the affected animals had a progressive increase in the incidence of aneurysms with age, reaching 100% by 6 months. Most aneurysms occurred in the ascending aorta, with some also present in the descending thoracic and abdominal segments. Some animals had multiple aneurysms. Histologically the blotchy mice aortas exhibited disrupted elastic lamellae and thickening of the interlamellar spaces. These spaces contained conspicuously pleomorphic smooth muscle cells, confirmed by electron microscopy. These changes occurred as early as 21 days, when there was no gross evidence of aneurysmal development. Aortic aneurysms develop in blotchy mice in a consistent fashion, with characteristic gross and histologic changes. These animals provide a practical model for further studies of aneurysmal disease, including possible therapeutic interventions to prevent aneurysm development.",

To decrease the risk of morbidity and death after blunt renovascular trauma, a patent artery with an intimal flap may be observed. Mandatory urgent repair is reserved for patients with bilateral renal injuries or for patients with a solitary kidney. Should symptomatic renal infarction or hypertension develop, delayed renal artery repair or nephrectomy is indicated.",

    "abstract": "In a prospective study 37 patients who required amputations of the leg were studied with a new technique: segmental photoplethysmographic skin perfusion pressures. The decision to amputate was made by a vascular surgeon in a traditional manner, with the aid of clinical criteria. The simple method of determining skin perfusion pressures with photoplethysmography is described; 273 measurements were performed. The technique proved to be highly correlated (r = 0.88) with wound healing after amputation, at a separating value of 21 mm Hg (p = 0.0001). The study suggests that the value of this noninvasive method will be to enable the surgeon to amputate at a lower level and to diminish complications and failure of rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "To determine the relative incidence of recurrent carotid stenosis (RCS) and the effect of methodology on data analysis and interpretation, late results were obtained for 232 patients (270 procedures) from 1 to 51 months (mean 22 months) after carotid endarterectomy (group A). Patency of the carotid artery was confirmed by postoperative intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for most of the series, and a subset (subgroup A1) of 113 patients (129 procedures) also received DSA studies at later intervals of 4 to 49 months (mean 26 months). There were 23 late deaths and five late strokes. Only two of the strokes were ipsilateral to previous endarterectomy, and both of these patients had normal follow-up DSA studies. Late DSA imaging revealed either no RCS or only trivial defects (20% diameter or less) in 111 arteries, moderate (36% to 60%) RCS in nine, severe (70% to 90%) RCS requiring secondary procedures in eight, and internal carotid occlusion in one. Depending on the definition of RCS (secondary operation vs greater than or equal to 30% angiographic lesions), the cohort selected for analysis (group A vs subgroup A1), and the approach to calculations (crude vs cumulative), the incidence of recurrent stenosis after carotid reconstruction in this single study could be expressed within the extraordinary wide range of 3% to 32%. Although carotid endarterectomy was associated with uniformly low risk for late stroke, these results confirm that the reported recurrence rate may be substantially influenced by the method in which data are grouped and manipulated. Consistently presented data are essential to any comparisons concerning the surgical therapy for extracranial disease.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effect of 9-beta-methyl carbacyclin, a synthetic, stable prostacyclin analog, on canine polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft patency. Twenty-five dogs had 4 mm x 7 cm PTFE grafts implanted bilaterally into the femoral arteries. A subcutaneous infusion pump was used to deliver either saline solution (control) or 9-beta-methyl carbacyclin (Ciprostine) at 100 (CARB-100) or 200 ng/kg/min (CARB-200) through a femoral artery branch just proximal to one of the femoral grafts, with the contralateral graft serving as a noninfused control. Graft-platelet deposition (with 111In-labeled platelets) was measured between the fifth and seventh days, with patency determined on the seventh day. Dogs were classified as aggregators (AGG [+]) if the preoperative epinephrine-enhanced sodium arachidonate platelet aggregation was greater than 20%. CARB-200 infusion significantly improved ipsilateral graft patency (80%) compared with noninfused grafts (50%, p less than 0.05), or grafts in control and CARB-100 dogs (43%, p less than 0.05). Anastomotic platelet deposition was decreased bilaterally in CARB-200 dogs by 45% to 59% compared with CARB-100 and control dogs (p less than 0.05). With the exception of grafts infused with CARB-200, AGG (+) dogs had significantly lower graft patency (26%) than nonaggregator AGG (-) dogs (71%, p less than 0.01). CARB-200 infusion significantly improved graft patency in AGG (+) dogs (71%), compared with control and CARB-100-infused grafts (19%, p less than 0.025). Intra-arterial 9-beta-methyl carbacyclin improved early PTFE graft patency and inhibited platelet deposition in a severe canine model, independent of baseline platelet aggregation status, which also had an important effect on graft patency.",

The sutureless intraluminal graft with an elastic ring can attach itself to the vessel wall by elastic expansion of the ring. The elastic-ring graft was implanted in the descending thoracic aortas of nine dogs and was evaluated histologically and angiographically at different intervals from 18 to 150 days. No complication such as detachment of the ring, aortic rupture, stenosis, or aneurysmal dilatation was observed. With the new graft neither ligation nor posterior aortic wall dissection is necessary, and no anastomotic stenosis occurs. This graft is applicable even if the diameter of the aorta is small. Therefore the elastic-ring sutureless intraluminal graft promises theoretic advantages over sutureless methods that use tape ligation.",

    "abstract": "Because clinical assessment of bowel viability is unreliable, other methods of determining intestinal perfusion have been recommended. Since none of these quantifies intestinal blood flow, we measured flow at the detection thresholds of Doppler ultrasound, photoplethysmography, and intravenously administered fluorescein, perfused the intestines at these threshold levels, and assessed histologic evidence of ischemic damage. The intestines of five anesthetized dogs were perfused for 4 hours via an in-line pulsatile extra-corporeal circuit assembled between the iliac and superior mesenteric arteries at either relatively physiologic (approximately 20 ml/min/kg body weight) levels or reduced levels representing the flow detection thresholds of Doppler ultrasound or photoplethysmographic probes (approximately 4 ml/min/kg). Intravenously administered fluorescein was detected at even lower perfusion levels (approximately 2.1 ml/min/kg). Clear-cut ischemic changes were documented histologically in all subjects perfused at Doppler/PPG flow detection thresholds but in none of those perfused at normal levels. We conclude that threshold blood flow detection by any one of these methods, especially fluorescein, occurs at levels inadequate to guarantee tissue viability.",

    "abstract": "Colonization of a polyester (Dacron) vascular graft by Staphylococcus aureus 209P-R was studied. Twenty-five dogs had thoracoabdominal aortic bypass. After intervals of 2 hours (three dogs), 8 days (five dogs), 1 month (six dogs), 2 months (six dogs), or 6 months (five dogs), a bacteremic challenge was produced by intravenous injection of 6 x 10(8) colony-forming units of S. aureus. Two hours later grafts were removed and cut into 10 fragments, each submitted to bacterial counts and scanning electron microscopic studies. Results of bacterial counts were expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) per square centimeter of graft segment (median [lower to upper quartiles]). Normal canine aortas (n = 2) used as controls trapped no bacteria. Colonization of Dacron grafts varied according to the duration of graft function (p less than 0.01): after 2 hours, 4416.5 CFU (1158 to 9073 CFU); after 8 days, 1515 CFU (963 to 2893 CFU); after 1 month, 199 CFU (86 to 538 CFU); after 2 months, 615 CFU (243 to 1407 CFU); and after 6 months, 1 CFU (1 to 5 CFU). Heavily colonized fragments were observed for duration of graft function of 2 months or less, whereas at 6 months all the fragments trapped fewer than 50 CFU/cm2 of graft segment. Scanning electron microscopy showed that colonization was closely associated with healing. Staphylococcal entrapment was related to the amount of fibrin deposits, which were especially abundant where the thrombotic matrix was unorganized and on bare polyester filaments. Graft colonization is especially to be feared in the first weeks after graft implantation, an observation which may help to define guidelines for preventing hematogenous vascular graft infection.",

    "abstract": "Advances in venous reconstruction have been limited by inherent venous thrombogenicity and the absence of a suitable prosthetic material for use in the venous system. We have designed an in vivo experimental model to evaluate early blood-material interactions within the venous system and to quantitate drug efficacy in the alteration of platelet function and fibrin deposition in the baboon. An 8F catheter was placed percutaneously in the femoral vein of an adult male baboon. Indium 111-labeled autogenous platelets or iodine 125-labeled human fibrinogen was infused before the introduction, into the inferior vena cava, of a linear array of 5 x 15 mm alternating Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene samples attached to a benzalkonium-heparin-treated guide wire. At 60 or 120 minutes the samples were removed and a 1 ml aliquot of blood was drawn. The materials and blood samples were counted in a gamma well counter, and the material counts were normalized to the circulating label present in the 1 ml blood sample. The experiment was repeated after pretreatment with heparin, aspirin, or dextran. Whole blood clotting times and bleeding times were monitored. The results showed decreased platelet and fibrin deposition on polytetrafluoroethylene when compared with Dacron in the venous system. Aspirin, heparin, and dextran were all found to decrease platelet and fibrin deposition onto intravenously placed graft material samples (p less than 0.05, Student's t test). The data confirm the ability of the model to evaluate quantitatively anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and prospective graft materials for use in venous reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of prosthetic aortic graft infection was evaluated in 18 patients with history and findings suggestive of this complication. The prospective interpretation of MRI was compared with surgical findings. Sixteen patients had a graft infection verified at operation. Fourteen patients had infection of the retroperitoneal portion of the graft; two patients had an infection limited to one of the groins; no graft infection was found at surgical exploration in the remaining two patients. Perigraft infection was correctly diagnosed on the basis of MRI findings in 14 of 16 cases; findings were false negative in one case, questionable in another case, and correctly excluded graft infection in two of two cases. MRI also defined the extent of infection in 14 of 16 cases. MRI findings that supported the clinical suspicion of graft infection were perigraft fluid collections remaining more than 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, local inflammation was suggested by an increased signal intensity of adjacent muscle on T2-weighted images in some cases. CT scans were performed in 12 patients; these enabled a correct diagnosis in five and provided indeterminate or false information in seven. These results indicate that MRI is helpful in the diagnosis of aortic graft infection. Furthermore, MRI provides information about the extent of infection crucial for planning therapy.",

Of the 146 cases reported, 109 had surgical treatment with an operative mortality rate of 6.9%. Of those patients having surgery 96% were normotensive or were easily controlled postoperatively with antihypertensive medications.

Operative indications were acute azotemic renal failure (three patients), poorly controlled renovascular hypertension (four patients), and staged repair of bilateral renal artery disease (one patient). All revascularizations were successful in restoring renal function or rendering hypertension manageable and were assessed by means of renal flow scans, celiac angiography, or return of function in those patients with a solitary, functioning kidney. All patients survived the operation with one late death caused by myocardial infarction after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The gastroduodenal artery may be used as the source for arterial inflow in revascularization of the right renal artery by end-to-end anastomosis in approximately 50% of instances, conferring the advantage of the use of only one anastomosis and obviating the long-term possibility of vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "During the past 15 years, we have employed a modified classification and management plan to treat infections involving nonaortic peripheral arterial prosthetic grafts (PAPGs) without graft removal whenever possible. Sixty-eight infected wounds potentially involving PAPGs were initially treated by excision of necrotic and infected wound tissue in the operating room (wound excision). This was sufficient for all 34 minor infections that did not directly involve the graft. In the 34 remaining infected wounds with graft involvement (major infections), partial removal of a PAPG in 13 cases allowed preservation for up to 15 years of a functioning arterial segment and its collaterals. Ten other grafts were entirely saved. Only 11 of 34 major graft infections ultimately required total graft removal. This approach to infection complicating PAPGs resulted in only two deaths (6%) and directly led to limb loss or amputation at a higher level in eight patients (24%). Total removal of an infected PAPG is often unnecessary and may increase mortality and morbidity.",

    "abstract": "The kinetics of cefuroxime in serum and wound fluid were investigated in the period after vascular prosthetic implantation. Cefuroxime was administered as intravenous bolus injections in doses of 0.75 gm (five patients) or 1.5 gm (five patients). The concentration of cefuroxime in wound fluid increased after the injection and reached a maximal level corresponding to serum concentration levels with 1.5 hours. The subsequent elimination of cefuroxime from the wound fluid closely paralleled the elimination from the serum. The wound fluid concentrations were found to be greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in 8 and 5 hours, respectively, after injection of 0.75 gm of cefuroxime, and in 11 and 7 hours, respectively, after injection of 1.5 gm of cefuroxime.",

    "abstract": "Secondary vascular procedures to below-knee vessels for lower extremity ischemia present a challenge to the vascular surgeon. Autogenous vein is often unavailable and failure of the previous bypass often limits the choice of distal vessels suitable for revascularization. This dilemma raises the question of amputation vs secondary vascular surgery. To address this question we reviewed the results of our previous aggressive approach to revascularization in a select group of 25 patients (26 limbs) who had secondary procedures with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts to tibial vessels or the infragenicular popliteal artery with single-vessel runoff. Nine of these 26 bypasses (35%) have remained patent for a mean of 17.2 months and no amputations have been done in this group. The other 17 bypasses (65%) have occluded from 1 day to 36 months postoperatively (mean 4.3 months); 15 of these limbs have required major amputation (58%). Ten were performed within the first 3 months postoperatively. Thirteen of the 25 patients died in the follow-up period (mean 27.5 months); five of these patients had viable limbs. Of 12 surviving patients (mean follow-up 19.9 months), six had viable limbs and six have required amputation. These results indicate that patients having secondary vascular surgical procedures with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts to tibial vessels have a high amputation rate and poor overall survival. Within this select group of patients, those who could walk with the aid of a prosthesis should be considered as candidates for primary amputation. This would facilitate rehabilitation and avoid the anguish of recurrent graft failure and multiple procedures.",

    "abstract": "Of the patients with penetrating neck wounds treated between 1979 and 1986, 61 patients with 65 injuries had arteriography during their evaluation. Twenty-seven patients had stab wounds and 34 had gunshot wounds, with a relatively equal distribution between the zones of injury. Fifty-seven arteriograms were normal and six were abnormal. Of the six arteriographic defects, three were thought to be spurious on subsequent review, two were clinically insignificant, and one required surgery. No significant arterial injuries were identified by arteriography in the absence of suggestive physical findings. No major arterial injuries were discovered during neck surgery that were missed preoperatively. Neither abnormal nor normal angiograms significantly altered the course of management, including the approach to neck exploration. These data suggest that arteriography for penetrating neck trauma is usually unnecessary for observation of patients in stable condition without suggestive physical findings. Thorough neck exploration with dissection of the carotid sheath in patients with physical diagnostic criteria for surgery eliminates the need for angiography in most cases and avoids the consequences of a possible false-negative study.",

    "abstract": "Fifty-five patients with 72 aneurysms of the iliac vessels were evaluated retrospectively during a 12-year period (1972 to 1985). Atherosclerotic vascular disease was found in all aneurysms. Marked male predominance (5:1) and advanced age (mean 74.6 years) characterized this population group. Two thirds of them harbored multiple aneurysms and isolated aneurysms were found primarily to involve the internal iliac artery (12 of 18 patients). Although symptomatic presentation varied with anatomic location and presence of rupture, most patients were either asymptomatic (45%) or had such nonspecific complaints (11%) that diagnosis was often delayed or erroneous. A mass detected during abdominal, rectal, or vaginal examination was found in 39 patients (70%). Aneurysm size ranged from 2.5 to 18 cm (mean 5.5 cm) for the entire group. Internal iliac aneurysms tended to be larger (7.7 cm) yet demonstrated no increased risk of rupture, which was encountered in 33% of patients. Elective operative management was undertaken in 26 patients with a mortality rate of 11%. When repair had to be performed as an emergency procedure mortality increased to 33%. Aneurysm ligation, resection, or endoaneurysmorrhaphy coupled with graft interposition when necessary did not seem to influence patient survival. Eleven patients treated nonoperatively demonstrated enlargement in three, rupture in one, and progressive ureteral obstruction in one patient. Iliac aneurysms demonstrate expansile growth with eruptive and erosive complications and therefore should be managed aggressively under elective circumstances.",

None of the patients had prophylactic coronary artery reconstruction to reduce the risk of AAA repair despite angina in 27% and previous myocardial infarction (MI) in 42%.

The overall perioperative (30-day) mortality rate was 5%. MI occurred in 7% within 30 postoperative days; none was fatal. Life-table analysis revealed that overall survival after AAA repair was significantly lower in patients with an EF of 50% or less (p less than 0.025, Mantel-Cox) during a follow-up of 20.1 +/- 11.9 months. Overall survival differences were even more striking for those with an EF of 35% or less (p = 0.003, Mantel-Cox).

    "abstract": "Favorable long-term results have been reported after femorofemoral bypass in the treatment of iliofemoral occlusive disease. Functional alterations in the donor artery, occurring after the implantation of the graft, have been considered as having an arresting effect on the progress of the occlusive disease, which explains the favorable long-term results. However, until now, the intrinsic mechanism of this phenomenon has remained unexplained. Little attention has been devoted to the evaluation of the natural history of the donor artery. To achieve this purpose, 18 patients previously operated on for femorofemoral bypass, with a normal patent graft, were submitted to angiographic evaluation, from 8 to 57 months after the operation (mean 22 months). The angiograms were compared with the preoperative films to assess the progress of the occlusive disease in the donor artery. A slight but significant dilatation of the proximal donor arterial segment was documented in every case, affecting the external iliac and common femoral arteries. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is discussed. It may be related to decreased peripheral resistance and increased blood flow occurring in the donor arterial segment, reported after the implantation of the shunt. This dilatation of the donor artery may have a compensatory effect for local atherosclerotic stenosis, thereby explaining the favorably long duration of the femorofemoral bypasses, which has been emphasized since the early days of extraanatomic revascularization. A similar phenomenon may occur in the vessels of the upper extremity, after axillofemoral revascularization.",

    "abstract": "The study of ischemia and reperfusion injury in the extremity has been hampered by lack of an accurate method of measuring skeletal muscle injury. We used a bilateral isolated in vivo canine gracilis muscle model in 15 anesthetized dogs. The experimental muscles had 4, 6, or 8 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. The contralateral gracilis muscle served as a control. Technetium 99m pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP), an agent which localizes in injured muscle cells, was used to quantitate canine skeletal muscle damage. After 6 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion, there was a significant increase of 215% of 99mTc-PYP uptake in the experimental vs the control muscle. Experimental muscle uptake was 8% greater than control after 4 hours and 405% more after 8 hours of ischemia and reperfusion. Segmental distribution of 99mTc-PYP uptake showed localization to be greatest in the middle of the muscle at the entry site of the gracilis artery. Electron microscopic evaluation also documented this area to have undergone the most severe injury. Distal portions of the muscle did not show increased damage.

The pattern of 99mTc-PYP uptake suggests that considerable injury is caused during reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "Potential differences in flow rates between reversed and in situ saphenous vein bypass grafts were evaluated. One hundred ten greater saphenous vein segments containing isolated valves were examined with fiber-optic angioscopy during pulsatile and nonpulsatile flow. Valve competency was determined, and the degree of luminal obstruction caused by the valve during reversed flow was calculated with caliper measurements of the video image. Flow measurements were obtained before and after valvulotomy, in reversed and nonreversed vein orientations. Increased flow rates occurred during pulsatile irrigation only, after valvulotomy in vein segments with diameters less than 2.5 mm (p less than 0.001, Bonferroni t test). In these small-diameter vein segments, the flow rate in reversed valve-intact vein was 94.4 +/- 28.9 ml/min (mean +/- 1 standard deviation), the flow rate in reversed valve-disrupted vein was 136.4 +/- 36.5 ml/min, and the flow rate in nonreversed valve-disrupted vein was 137.8 +/- 31.3 ml/min. In 22 vein segments, luminal obstruction caused by the intact valve was measured angioscopically. A small valve orifice was found to be related to a large increase in flow rate after valvulotomy (p less than 0.02, least-squares regression). In addition, veins with diameters less than 2.5 mm have significantly smaller valve orifices compared with veins with diameters greater than 2.5 mm. These results present important clinical implications as the number of distal extremity reconstructions increases.",

    "abstract": "Anastomotic false aneurysm (AFA) of the aorta or iliac artery is a potentially lethal complication of prosthetic grafts. To study this complication, the records of 18 patients with 22 noninfected AFAs (15 aortic and seven iliac) were reviewed. Patients with an intact AFA had a pulsatile abdominal mass, abdominal pain, an occluded graft, peripheral emboli, or a femoral anastomotic false aneurysm. All patients with a ruptured AFA were in shock, but 67% (four of six) had symptoms before hemorrhage. For diagnosis, single-plane angiography was 69% accurate (11 of 16), computed tomography was 100% accurate (six of six), and ultrasound was used once and suggested an AFA. Three patients with an AFA less than 5 cm diameter were initially observed; however, all three aneurysms rapidly enlarged and one ruptured. The operative mortality rate was 8% (1 of 12) for patients with an intact aneurysm and 67% (four of six) for patients with a ruptured aneurysm. Treatment was resection of the AFA and replacement with a new graft. Retroperitoneal AFAs often appear years after the initial operation, and life-long follow-up is required for patients with an aortic or iliac graft. All retroperitoneal AFAs should be resected since the outcome of patients with a ruptured AFA is poor.",

    "abstract": "The results of treatment after excision of infected arterial grafts were analyzed as a function of aortic/arterial wall cultures and duration of antibiotic therapy in 33 patients. Four patients died during surgery and 29 patients were observed for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 76 months. Negative arterial wall cultures (NAwC) were found in 16 patients, three of whom died of multiple-organ failure and sepsis but none of whom had aortic/arterial disruption/hemorrhage. Positive arterial wall cultures (PAwC) were found in 13 patients, seven of whom received short-term, broad-spectrum antibiotics for less than 10 days (PAwC-STA) and six of whom received long-term culture-specific antibiotic therapy (intravenous therapy for 6 weeks and oral therapy for 6 months) (PAwC-LTA). Five of seven patients in the PAwC-STA group died of aortic disruption or hemorrhage, one patient had severe hemorrhage caused by disintegration of a saphenous vein patch over the common femoral artery, and one patient had a recurrent aortoenteric fistula. There were 10 episodes of arterial disruption/hemorrhage in those seven patients. All episodes of aortic/arterial disruption/hemorrhage occurred in the PAwC-STA subgroup (seven of seven patients) and none occurred in the PAwC-LTA subgroup (none of six patients) (0.005 less than p less than 0.001). The incidence of aortic/arterial disruption/hemorrhage was significantly different between overall PAwC (7 of 13 patients) vs NAwC (none of 16 patients) (0.005 less than p less than 0.001) and NAwC-STA (none of 16 patients) vs PAwC-STA (seven of seven patients) (0.001 less than p less than 0.0005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To determine the usefulness of computed electroencephalographic (EEG) topographic (CET) brain mapping to monitor neurologic function during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 46 consecutive patients having CEA were monitored preoperatively, intraoperatively, and immediately postoperatively by CET brain mapping and simultaneous 16-lead EEG. Preoperative studies revealed that 7 of 16 asymptomatic patients, 5 of 11 patients with amaurosis fugax, and 8 of 12 patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) had abnormal CET brain mapping suggestive of previous subclinical stroke. EEG was abnormal in only 8 of the 20 patients with abnormal CET brain mapping. Intraoperatively during carotid cross-clamping, ischemic changes were seen on CET brain mapping in 23 patients whereas EEG detected these changes in only 13 patients. Ischemic changes detected by intraoperative CET brain mapping were more likely to occur in patients with previous stroke (six of seven) than in patients without previous stroke (17 of 39), p less than 0.05. Patients with changes detected by intraoperative CET brain mapping had an average carotid back-pressure of 38 mm Hg, in contrast to 57 mm Hg for patients without CET brain mapping changes, p less than 0.05. After endarterectomy, CET brain mapping revealed new ischemic changes in one patient who awoke with a mild stroke and in one patient who had TIAs and amaurosis fugax within 6 hours of surgery. We conclude that CET brain mapping is a sensitive, accurate, and useful noninvasive monitor of cerebral circulation and function for patients having CEA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to analyze the long-term results of femoropopliteal bypass done preferentially with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in patients who presumably had saphenous vein available. The results are analyzed according to preoperative variables in an attempt to determine those instances in which PTFE grafts may be preferred for the first reconstruction and to identify those patients who benefited from vein preservation. From 1979 to 1985, 146 femoropopliteal bypass operations were performed in 120 patients with 6 mm PTFE grafts used preferentially. The results with follow-up at 5 years are analyzed by actuarial methods. The patency rate at hospital discharge was 100%. The overall primary patency rate at 5 years was 57%. Reconstructions above the knee (101) and below the knee (45) had significantly different 5-year patency rates (63% vs 44%, p less than 0.03). Sixty-two reconstructions done to alleviate disabling claudication had a 5-year primary patency rate of 69% and no amputations. Eighty-one reconstructions were done to treat critical ischemia with a 5-year patency rate of 49% and a 5-year foot salvage rate of 73%. When secondary operations were required to treat graft failures, the 4-year cumulative patency rate of the secondary reconstruction was 18% when performed with a prosthetic graft, in contrast to 70% when performed with the spared saphenous vein. We conclude that femoropopliteal reconstruction with PTFE grafts is a reasonable alternative for older patients with disabling claudication. Patients with critical ischemia will likely benefit from preservation of the vein with initial femoropopliteal reconstruction done with PTFE. Staged infrainguinal revascularization for foot salvage may improve present results. In this regard the sequence PTFE-then-vein carries a higher predicted patency rate than the sequence vein-then-PTFE.",

    "abstract": "The frequency and causes of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding occurring after aortic surgery were evaluated retrospectively to determine the incidence of aortoenteric fistula (AEF) in relation to other causes and to place in perspective the role of laparotomy for the diagnosis of AEF. Two hundred fifty-three patients in whom aortic prostheses have been inserted were observed for a mean of 46 months. Seventy-four bleeding episodes occurred in 21% of patients between 1 and 108 months after surgery (mean 29 months). Only one AEF appeared that was associated with GI bleeding, for an incidence of 1.4% of bleeding episodes and 0.4% of grafts inserted. No diagnostic workup for GI bleeding was performed for 20 of the 74 episodes and no AEFs were noted in this group during a mean follow-up of 28 months. Diagnostic evaluation was done for the remaining 54 episodes. No cause for bleeding was identified in 16 patients and no AEF developed in this group during a mean follow-up of 26 months. A potential bleeding site was identified in 38 patients, of whom 30 had intrinsic GI lesions and no subsequent evidence of AEF during a mean follow-up of 28 months. Laparotomy for a suspected AEF was recommended for the remaining eight episodes in eight patients and was performed in six patients. An AEF was seen in one patient with abnormality found on preoperative CT scanning; an intrinsic GI lesion was identified in three patients; and no pathologic condition was found in the remaining two (negative laparotomy rate, 33%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Sequential 1 cm longitudinal carotid and femoral arteriotomies (n = 80) or jugular and femoral phlebotomies (n = 80) were performed, with each vessel having two tandem, randomly positioned arteriotomies or phlebotomies separated by a 4 cm length of intact vessel. One incision was repaired by SVA with continuous 6-0 polypropylene sutures and the other by argon LAVA. For the laser fusions, argon laser energy was applied to the adventitial surface of the vessel with a 300 micron fiberoptic probe with 0.5 W power, 1100 joules per square centimeter energy fluence, and 150 second exposure per 1 cm length. The arterial and venous segments of SVAs and LAVAs and an equivalent length of normal vessel were harvested at 48 hours (n = 16, 16, 16), 2 weeks (n = 12, 12, 12), and 4 weeks (n = 12, 12, 12). Autologous indium 111 oxine-labeled platelets were injected intravenously 48 hours before removal of the vascular repairs and the radioactivity of the specimens was determined on removal with a NaI (T1) well-type scintillation counter. Anastomotic platelet adherence index (APAI) was calculated as the ratio of emissions of SVA or LAVA to normal reference vessel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We assessed the capacity of preformed confluent endothelial cell (EC) monolayers on small-caliber prosthetic grafts to prevent early platelet deposition in a baboon model. Cultured human umbilical vein ECs were attached to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex, 4 mm inner diameter, 3 cm length) precoated with type I collagen and perfused in vitro for 2 hours at 15 ml/min with serum-containing culture medium to achieve cell spreading into confluent monolayers. Cell numbers were quantified by deoxyribonucleic acid assay or isotopic counting of indium 111-labeled ECs. Saturation density for cell attachment was 3.55 +/- 0.29 x 10(5) cells per square centimeter of graft. After 1 hour of in vitro perfusion at 100 ml/min, 92.8% +/- 1.8% of cells remained attached and the flow surface was morphologically confluent. When grafts were inserted as extension segments into arteriovenous silicone rubber (Silastic) shunts in baboons, thereby exposing the endothelialized grafts to native flowing blood (100 ml/min) for 1 hour, the EC monolayers remained confluent with 81.05% +/- 5.88% of the cells attached. Indium 111-labeled platelet deposition onto grafts was quantified by dynamic scintillation camera imaging. Platelet deposition on 10 endothelialized grafts was markedly reduced (0.16 +/- 0.04 x 10(9) platelets per graft) compared with 10 untreated control grafts (1.84 +/- 0.59 x 10(9) platelets, p less than 0.02), eight grafts with early attached unspread ECs (2.38 +/- 0.66 x 10(9) platelets, p less than 0.005), and 11 grafts treated with collagen alone (5.93 +/- 0.72 x 10(9) platelets, p less than 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Infected femoral artery pseudoaneurysms in narcotic addicts present challenging management options. Our policy of routine revascularization is based on the concern that a high rate of amputations must follow ligation and resection alone or with selective delayed revascularization. Fifteen of 16 patients with infected pseudoaneurysms of femoral arteries, treated with resection and bypass grafts, were observed from 1 to 44 months. Obturator bypass grafts were used in 10 patients, iliac-femoral grafts in three, axillopopliteal in one, and right external iliac crossover to left popliteal in one patient. One limb, unsalvageable at presentation, was amputated primarily, along with resection of pseudoaneurysm and femoral artery ligation, without bypass grafting. One iliac-femoral graft became infected and then thrombosed 4 months after operation. Unsuitable distal arteries and impending necrosis led to above-knee amputation. One late failure among 15 revascularization attempts (7%) is significantly lower than the 11% to 33% amputation rates reported in the literature with resection of pseudoaneurysm alone and delayed selective revascularization. The other 14 patients had functioning limbs without claudication or rest pain. Our experience indicates that revascularization at the time of resection of infected pseudoaneurysm offers better prospects for limb salvage.",

The objective of this study was to determine perioperative (30-day) and subsequent outcome after major vascular surgery in those with severe cardiac dysfunction, defined by EF being 35% or less (normal EF greater than 50%). From Aug. 1, 1984 to Jan. 1, 1988, 35 patients with EF equal to 27.7% +/- 6.1% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) have required 47 major vascular procedures: 53% (n = 25) were limb revascularizations; 21% (n = 10) were direct aortoiliac aneurysm repairs: 23% (n = 11) were carotid endarterectomies: one patient had transaortic renal endarterectomy. Two deaths occurred within the first 30 days, yielding a 4.3% perioperative mortality rate (2 of 47 procedures). The cumulative mortality rate for the entire group during follow-up of 410 +/- 390 days was 40% (14 of 35 patients). Most late deaths (71%) occurred within the first 6 months after surgery and each was due to cardiovascular complications. Survival for those with an EF of 29% or less was significantly worse than for those with an EF greater than 29%, determined by life-table analysis (p less than 0.012, Mantel-Cox). The cumulative mortality rate was 59% with an EF of 29% or less and 18% in those with an EF greater than 29% (p less than 0.029, two-tailed Fisher exact test). The perioperative mortality rate for those with an EF of 35% or less who require major vascular surgery is acceptable, but overall survival during follow-up is diminished.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Each subject was supine and non-weight-bearing on a tilt table and rotated in 10-degree increments from -10 degrees (head down) to +30 degrees (head up). Cross-sectional B-mode image was used to monitor continuously CFV diameter for 5 minutes in each position. Doppler flow patterns were recorded in longitudinal axis; heart rate and respiratory movements were also noted. CFV flow was affected by respiratory and cardiac events. At -10 degrees flow was primarily related to cardiac events, with flow increasing during diastole. At +30 degrees flow varied minimally with the cardiac cycle and was primarily respiration dependent, stopping at peak inspiration. Proceeding from -10 to +30 degrees the mean maximal CFV diameter corrected for body surface area increased 92% (0.47 +/- 0.11 cm/m2 to 0.90 +/- 0.16 cm/m2, p less than 0.001), whereas peak flow velocity decreased from 41 +/- 10 cm/sec to 13 +/- 5 cm/sec, p less than 0.001.

We compared the surgical outcome in 96 such patients after ABF (n = 32), FF (n = 47), or IF (n = 17) bypasses, with biplane arteriography and noninvasive laboratory testing used to assess the contralateral iliac artery and runoff status, in particular, patency of the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Graft patencies were assessed by noninvasive criteria and analyzed by the life-table method. The only death occurred after ABF bypass (3.1%). Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years with an open SFA were 100%, 89% and 89%, respectively, for ABF; 92%, 92%, and 92% for FF; and 71%, 71%, and 36% for IF. When the SFA was occluded, the primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 100%, 100%, and 72%, respectively, for ABF; 72%, 53%, and 35% for FF; and 56%, 56%, and 56% for IF bypasses. There were no later occlusions on the contralateral (\"good\") side after ABF. Significant progression of atherosclerosis in donor iliac artery was observed in 6% of both FF and IF bypasses. We conclude that ABF is the preferred operation for extensive iliac artery occlusive disease that is hemodynamically significant only on the symptomatic side unless specifically contraindicated by prohibitive risk or abdominal disease. This is particularly true in the face of SFA occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) of 83 renal artery lesions in 55 patients was done because of renal failure in eight patients, hypertension in 35, renal failure and hypertension in 11, and polycythemia in one patient. Early results in 38 patients with arteriosclerosis showed five (13%) were worse and 13 (34%) were unchanged. Twenty patients (53%) with arteriosclerosis were initially cured or improved; however, seven of these patients had recurrence in 4 to 48 months. Ultimately, only 13 of 38 patients with arteriosclerosis (34%) were cured or improved (mean follow-up 22 months). Nine patients with fibromuscular dysplasia required 17 dilatations of arteries (three bilateral and five repeat), resulting in eight patients (89%) who were cured or improved. Selection of patients with hypertension by medical failure while receiving three or more hypertension medications or by lateralizing renal vein renin values yielded benefit in 17 of 26 patients (65%). Five of six patients with transplant stenosis of the renal artery and hypertension were cured or improved at mean follow-up of 18 months. Overall technical results of 83 artery dilatations were as follows: good, 58 (69%); fair, 10 (12%); poor or unsatisfactory, 16 (19%); these were judged with a blinded radiologic review. No patient suffered main renal artery thrombosis. There were 16 patients with complications of dilatation (morbidity rate of 29%). Nine patients subsequently had renal artery surgery from the same day to 64 days later with good results in all patients except one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The role of balloon catheter femoropopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (FP PTA) continues to be controversial 14 years after its initial description. In high-risk patients with limb-threatening ischemia, the role of FP PTA is unknown. We reviewed the cases of 27 patients in whom high operative risk and advanced ischemia resulted in referral for PTA of the femoropopliteal segment. Technical and hemodynamic success rates were 74% and 52%, respectively. Patient follow-up was 3 to 84 months after PTA (mean 24 months). Nine patients (33%) had successful limb salvage for more than 12 months. The cumulative limb salvage rate was 47% at 2 years. Established prognostic criteria did not predict this subset of patients. Hemodynamic improvement after PTA did correlate closely with both early and late successful limb salvage. There were two periprocedural deaths. Morbidity included an acute arterial occlusion necessitating an emergency FP bypass and two minor complications. FP PTA is useful in selected high-risk patients with limb-threatening ischemia. Protocols to facilitate successful long-term limb salvage must include close liaison between the vascular surgeon and interventional radiologist, intensive periprocedural monitoring, and serial noninvasive hemodynamic assessment.",

    "abstract": "Two hundred forty-nine well-characterized difficult distal bypasses, entered into a multicenter dextran 40 trial, were reevaluated after 3 years. Seventy in situ (IS) vein grafts, 49 reversed saphenous (RS) vein grafts, 60 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, and 70 umbilical vein (UV) grafts were used. Primary and secondary patency rates at 3 years were, respectively, 84% and 90% for IS, 66% and 73% for RS, 35% and 48% for PTFE, and 24% and 32% for UV. Subgroup analysis according to the site of distal anastomosis showed no significant differences in primary patency among these grafts at the above-knee level but significant differences between both vein grafts (IS and RV) and the others (PTFE and UV) below the knee (78% vs 31%, respectively). This difference increased at the tibial level (78% vs 10%) but there was also a significant difference between IS grafts (88%) and RS grafts (63%) at this level. Hazard functional analysis showed all grafts except IS grafts begin to fail at an increasing rate again by 24 months. Although overall results appeared to favor PTFE over UV, 62% of PTFE vs 16% of UV terminated at the above-knee level and the patency results of these two grafts were not significantly different at any level. The only other factor than graft type and distal anastomotic site that consistently correlated with late patency was tobacco use. Diabetic patients actually fared significantly better than nondiabetic patients, presumably because of the higher use of IS grafts and lower use of tobacco. The choice of graft overshadows all other factors affecting patency and its influence is magnified with more distal terminal anastomosis.",

    "abstract": "From Jan. 1, 1979 through July 31, 1987, 63 patients had carotid endarterectomy (CEA) concurrently with cardiac surgical procedures including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 61, CABG plus mitral value replacement in one, and aortic valve replacement in one. Among the 62 patients having CABG, unstable angina had been present in 36 (58%), left main coronary artery disease in 21 (34%), and both unstable angina and left main coronary artery disease in 13 (21%). Indications for carotid surgery included previous stroke, amaurosis fugax, or hemispheric transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in 33 patients (52%); bilaterally significant carotid disease was noted in 48% of the patients. Major neurologic complications occurred in three patients (4.8%), including perioperative stroke in two (3.2%) (fatal in one) and a TIA in a third patient. Bilateral carotid lesions, a contralateral total carotid occlusion, previous cerebrovascular symptoms, and intraaortic balloon pump support did not increase neurologic risk. Seven patients died postoperatively (11%). The mortality rate was 2.8% in patients younger than 65 years vs 22% in patients 65 years or older, 19% in patients with left main coronary artery disease vs 7.3% in patients without, 13.3% in men vs 5.6% in women, 25% in patients with a history of congestive heart failure vs 7.8% in patients without failure, and 6.2% in patients with unilateral carotid disease, 17% in patients with bilateral carotid disease, and 23% in patients with bilateral disease including a contralateral carotid occlusion. A mortality predictive index (MPI) was developed to summarize individual risk for a fatal outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta causes renal ischemia and activates the renin-angiotensin system with resulting increased production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral constrictor and elevated levels may constrict collateral spinal cord circulation. At the time of aortic cross-clamping, 10 dogs received 100 mg/kg of MK422 (intravenous enalapril maleate), a converting enzyme inhibitor, and nine animals served as controls. The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system had no preserving effects on spinal cord flow as measured by microspheres and on spinal cord function as graded with the Tarlov scale. However, the paraplegic animals all had significantly increased lower thoracic and lumbar spinal cord flows 30 minutes after clamp release when compared with those animals that remained neurologically intact. In conclusion, marked hyperemia occurring after a period of hypoperfusion may lead to spinal cord edema and compartment syndrome with resulting paraplegia.",

    "abstract": "The benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CE) in preventing recurrent stroke and improving survival in the patient who has sustained a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) or stroke is still controversial. To determine the long-term benefits and value of CE in these patients, a 10-year review of 253 patients who suffered a RIND or stroke was conducted. All patients had CT brain scans, as well as arch, extracranial, and intracranial arteriography; any patients without demonstrated carotid bifurcation disease were excluded from the study. On the basis of clinical symptoms and CT scan findings, 66 patients were categorized as having sustained a RIND and 187 a stroke. One hundred fifty-one patients who suffered a RIND or stroke had CE, whereas 102 patients with RIND or stroke did not have CE and served as a control group. All endarterectomies were performed with a temporary indwelling shunt. Postoperative complications included two deaths (1%), six strokes (4%), and 10 transient neurologic deficits (7%). In follow-up extending to 10 years the cumulative incidence of recurrent stroke was only 7% (11 patients) in the operated group, whereas 18% of patients in the nonoperated control group (18) sustained a recurrent stroke (p less than 0.05). As anticipated, the leading cause of death during follow-up was cardiac related; although CE did not significantly improve long-term survival, there was more than a twofold decrease in the incidence of recurrent stroke as a cause of death in the group having CE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic differences between aortic and venous endothelial cells were demonstrated by studies of morphology, growth rates, and protein synthesis. Endothelial cells from bovine thoracic aortas (AECs) and inferior vena caval (VECs) were harvested, maintained in cell culture, and characterized. VECs were consistently larger (mean cell diameter 14.3 micron vs 12.7 micron; p less than 0.001) and more pleomorphic than were AECs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that VECs were thinner than AECs and that VECs had numerous fine, cellular processes that were much less abundant on the AECs. Enzymatic disaggregation of confluent cells resulted in a reduced generation time by the AECs compared with VECs. Moreover, VECs responded to disaggregation by a significantly larger increase in cell size than the AECs. Protein synthesis was quantitated by computer analysis of autoradiograph of two-dimensional gel eletrophoresis and separation of 998 35S-methionine-labeled proteins from cell lysates. Synthesis of 257 proteins was significantly different (p less than 0.05); synthesis of 239 proteins by VECs was either decreased (219) or undetectable (20) compared with those of AECs. In contrast, only 18 proteins were produced in significantly greater quantity by VECs than by AECs. The cytoskeletal proteins actin and alpha- and beta-tubulins were produced in significantly greater quantity by AECs than VECs. These results indicate that cultured endothelial cells of arterial origin are substantially different from those of the venous circulation. These phenotypic differences are maintained in vitro despite eliminating variability in hemodynamic stress and interaction with other cellular elements of the vessel wall.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of 41 patients with chronic mesenteric insufficiency is reviewed: 20 men and 21 women with a mean age of 59 years were treated and observed for an average of 42 months. Thirty-one patients had symptoms of intestinal angina whereas 10 patients underwent prophylactic revascularization during other aortic operations. All but one patient had revascularization of the superior mesenteric artery, alone or in combination with another revascularization. Various surgical techniques were used, including retrograde bypass in 24 patients, antegrade bypass in 11 patients, and endarterectomy in the remaining six patients. Seven patients had acute abdominal symptoms and required emergency operation while in the hospital awaiting elective revascularization. There were two deaths in the perioperative period (4.9%), both caused by bowel necrosis. Six patients are known to have had late revascularization failure, resulting in recurrent symptoms in three patients and two subsequent deaths. All patients who remained asymptomatic after late graft failure had undergone multiple vessel revascularization; no patient revascularized prophylactically had symptoms of intestinal angina during the follow-up period. Early mesenteric revascularization is a safe and effective method of relieving the symptoms of chronic visceral ischemia and may prevent the development of fatal bowel necrosis.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell growth in vitro is enhanced by coating with fibronectin the surface on which cells grow. Similar coating of prosthetic arterial grafts may promote in vivo graft endothelialization if graft patency is not adversely affected. In each of 15 dogs, two fibronectin-coated polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and two grafts that were not coated were implanted. One graft in each pair was seeded with autologous endothelial cells, so that four different grafts were studied in each animal: a coated, seeded graft; a coated graft that was not seeded; a seeded graft that was not coated; a graft that was neither coated nor seeded. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks, grafts from five animals were examined for patency, surface endothelialization, and indium 111 platelet reactivity. After seeding, surface coverage by endothelium of coated grafts was more complete and more rapid than in uncoated grafts (64% +/- 23% vs 31% +/- 13% at 4 weeks, p less than 0.05). Without seeding, coated grafts also appeared to have increased endothelial cell ingrowth compared with plain grafts (48.8% +/- 15.1% vs 37.6% +/- 1.5% at 8 weeks). Early (2-week) platelet reactivity of coated grafts was increased (p = 0.06), but patency was not adversely affected. Thus fibronectin coating of prosthetic grafts promotes surface endothelialization in vivo without altering graft patency.",

    "abstract": "This study was done to emphasize the importance of early, accurate diagnosis of arterial aneurysms that show the symptoms of venous obstruction. Fourteen patients were identified as having atherosclerotic aneurysms producing venous compression. Nine patients had popliteal aneurysms, causing popliteal vein thrombosis in three patients and vein compression without thrombosis in six patients. Five patients had iliac artery aneurysms, producing left iliac vein thrombosis in one patient and venous compression without thrombosis in four patients. In 10 patients the cause of the venous compression symptoms was correctly identified and appropriate revascularization was performed with successful results. In four patients, two with iliac artery aneurysms and two with popliteal artery aneurysms, the associated aneurysm was not identified. One patient died of a ruptured aneurysm and three patients had below-knee amputations because of untreatable distal ischemia. Inappropriate treatment of patients with venous obstruction from unrecognized arterial aneurysms is associated with unacceptable morbidity and mortality. Accurate diagnosis with timely aneurysm repair eliminates the risk of aneurysm rupture or thrombosis and simultaneously alleviates venous compression symptoms.",

    "abstract": "This article evaluates the ease, safety, and convenience of percutaneous Greenfield filter placement and compares percutaneous with surgical placement. Greenfield filters were inserted percutaneously into the inferior vena cava in 96 patients. Ninety filters were placed via the femoral route and 12 were placed from the right internal jugular vein. Six patients had two filters inserted. An inferior venacavogram was performed before filter insertion in all patients. Cavography provided vital information concerning diameter of the inferior vena cava, the level of the renal veins, and the presence and location of thrombus. Filter placement was accomplished in all patients in whom it was attempted. There were four minor complications and one periprocedural death. The incidence of documented femoral vein thrombosis that could be related to percutaneous placement via the femoral veins was 33%; however, none of these patients had permanent venous stasis sequelae. Percutaneous insertion of the Greenfield filter is a safe and convenient procedure and is superior to surgical placement in terms of time, logistics, and the accuracy of filter positioning.",

The carotid artery contralateral to the endarterectomy was severely stenosed (lumen diameter reduction 51% up to 99%) and it was not repaired for different reasons. Group I patients were compared with 78 patients who had bilateral CE (group II), matched with group I for associated diseases, operative indication, and angiographic findings. In this analysis, only neurologic deficits referable to the contralateral hemisphere were considered. There was a higher incidence of later neurologic deficits in the group I patients; however, this difference was not statistically significant. In group I, the occurrence of late neurologic deficits was statistically correlated to (1) severity of stenosis, (2) presence of large compound ulceration, and (3) history of previous stroke. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified two groups of patients at higher risk for late neurologic deficits (1) patients with stenosis 75% or greater and large ulceration and (2) patients with stenosis 75% or greater and previous stroke. CE on the asymptomatic contralateral side should be considered in selected patients at high risk for late neurologic events at a surgical center with an established low incidence of perioperative complications. A nonoperative policy with careful follow-up is warranted in the remaining cases.",

All operations were performed by the same surgeon in a community hospital from 1963 to 1986. Arteriographic findings consisted of carotid stenosis of 50% or greater in 88.5% of patients and stenosis less than 50% and/or an ulcerated plaque in the remaining 11.5%. Medical risk factors were detected in 92% of patients; hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary atherosclerosis were most prevalent. All operative procedures were conducted with the patients under general anesthesia, routine shunting, and arterial closure without a patch. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5% (10 patients); the morality rate was 0.8% (three deaths from myocardial infarction and two from stroke) for a combined stroke and mortality rate of 2.0% (13 of 605 patients). Follow-up (mean 61.8 months) was possible in 570 (96%) of the patients surviving operation without a perioperative stroke. The cumulative probability of late stroke (i.e., cerebral infarct ipsilateral to the operated artery) was 2.5% at 5 years and 8.1% at 10 years. When the perioperative stroke-mortality rate (2.0%) is combined with the data for late ipsilateral stroke, the 5- and 10-year probabilities of ipsilateral stroke were 4.5% and 9.9%, respectively (mean 1% per year for 10-year period). Coronary atherosclerosis accounted for 43% of late deaths and 16% of strokes. The perioperative stroke-mortality rate of 2.0% in this group of patients falls within the acceptable range for carotid endarterectomy in patients with TIA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "During the past 6 years, we have encountered 24 cases in which all major infrapopliteal arteries were occluded as determined by adequate preoperative angiography. Each patient initially had critical ischemia, 14 had a previous failed ipsilateral distal bypass, and seven had an unsuccessful lumbar sympathectomy. Instead of resorting to an amputation, we attempted to perform a bypass using patent branches of distal vessels. Of the 24 bypasses, 14 were to the lateral or medial plantar branches, three were to the deep plantar branch (plantar arch), three were to the lateral tarsal branch, and four were to unnamed branches of the proximal one third of the posterior tibial arteries (two) or anterior tibial arteries (two). All bypasses were performed with reversed saphenous vein with origins at or distal to the superficial femoral artery. Eight bypasses (four plantar and four unnamed branches) became thrombosed up to 30 months postoperatively, resulting in four below-knee amputations. Fifteen bypasses (all plantar branches) have been patent from 6 to 52 months (mean 26 +/- 13 months). The remaining patient required a below-knee amputation at 2 months despite a patent graft. These results underscore the value of this extended approach to limb salvage in situations previously believed to be indications for major amputations. Although bypasses to unnamed branches of the proximal tibial arteries did not fare well, those to the plantar branches and lateral tarsal branch resulted in excellent graft patency and limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "Although the two-stage amputation technique entails an additional operation, several authors have advocated this approach to deal with wet gangrene because it allows primary wound closure with a reduced chance of wound infection. To examine this issue, 47 patients with necrotizing wet gangrene of the foot were randomized prospectively to receive either a one-stage amputation (definitive below- or above-knee amputation with delayed secondary skin closure in 3 to 5 days) or a two-stage amputation (open ankle guillotine amputation followed by definitive, closed below- or above-knee amputation). Antibiotic coverage was standardized with clindamycin and gentamicin used in all patients. Preoperative blood cultures and intraoperative foot cultures were obtained, as well as cultures from the deep muscle and lymphatic area along the saphenous vein to determine the presence of bacteria at the level of initial amputation. Twenty-four patients (11 diabetic and 13 nondiabetic) were randomized to the one-stage procedure. Twenty-three patients (14 diabetic and nine nondiabetic) were randomized to the two-stage procedure. Five of 24 patients in the one-stage group (21%) had positive muscle cultures vs 10 of 23 patients in the two-stage group (43%). Two of 24 patients in the one-stage group (8%) had positive lymphatic cultures vs 7 of 23 patients in the two-stage group (30%). Five of 24 patients in the one-stage group (21%) had wound complications attributable to the amputation technique vs none of 23 patients in the two-stage group (p = 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "An in vivo system was established whereby the transmural forces exerted across the arterial wall during vascular occlusion were directly measured. Evaluation of various currently available vascular occlusive devices was conducted and transmural force transmission data were recorded. The clamps were classified according to their mechanical design characteristics. The magnitude of force required to obtain cessation of distal flow varied significantly among devices of differing mechanical design but correlated well when compared with clamps of similar design. This information was then compared with graded analysis of the degree of intimal injury created by these specific devices as assessed with scanning electron microscopy. The amount of transmural force exerted by each individual device correlated with the grade of intimal injury created by that device. We conclude that fundamental clamp design dictates the magnitude of applied transmural force, that force and the vectors of the application of that force are directly responsible for the degree of resultant intimal injury, and that the intima appears to possess an injury threshold of approximately 5 x 10(4) dynes/cm2. Intimal injury may determine success or failure of vascular surgical procedures; therefore it is prudent to seek the least traumatic means of vascular occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Compression of the left renal vein (LRV) between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta has been termed the nutcracker syndrome. Although often asymptomatic, this syndrome may result in varicocele, ovarian vein syndrome, and rarely LRV hypertension, pelviureteral varices, hematuria, and flank pain. Previous surgical approaches have included nephrectomy, variceal ligation, nephropexy, or renocaval reimplantation. We report a new LRV stenting procedure that provided relief for a young woman incapacitated by daily left flank pain and microscopic hematuria. Phlebography of the LRV revealed mesoaortic compression associated with a pressure gradient of 12 mm Hg and preferential outflow down large pelviureteral varices. At operation compression of the LRV was corrected with an external stent of reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene. The patient was asymptomatic and free of hematuria for 9 months after operation and follow-up phlebography documented normal renocaval flow, elimination of the pressure gradient, and reduction of the pelviureteral varices. This represents the first description in the vascular surgical literature of this venous compression syndrome, which has been recognized in previous urologic and radiologic reports reviewed herein. Vascular surgeons should be cognizant of the nutcracker syndrome, and we recommend this new stenting procedure as a more simple and physiologic therapy than previous approaches to this problem.",

    "abstract": "This article is concerned with observations in 17 patients with renal fusion and ectopic abnormalities: horseshoe kidney in 13 patients, crossed ectopia with fusion in two, pancake kidney in one, and pelvic kidney in one. Three patients had occlusive disease, one may have had renal artery occlusion, and 13 had aneurysms--three thoracoabdominal and 10 infrarenal. Rupture of aneurysm had occurred in one patient at each level and six patients had had one or more previous attempts at aneurysmal removal. Diagnosis and evaluation were made with the aid of intravenous pyelography, retrograde pyelography, CT scanning, and at operation (three patients). Three patients had two normally located right and left renal arteries. Twelve patients had one to three additional aberrant arteries arising from the aorta and iliac arteries. One patient's renal blood supply arose from multiple aberrant arteries. Ureters crossed the midline in two patients. Treatment of occlusive disease consisted of endarterectomy in one patient and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in two. Aneurysms were treated by graft replacement with retroperitoneal exposure in seven patients and transabdominal exposure in six. One patient was treated medically. Renal isthmus division was employed in only two patients and involved accessory arteries were reattached to the grafts in all cases. Death from myocardial infarction occurred in two patients (12%). Eleven patients subjected to operation were alive 6 months to 14 years later.",

    "abstract": "Low-dose dopamine (DA) is often used in surgical patients to induce diuresis when appropriate volume replacement is unsuccessful. Despite wide application, there are little objective data supporting any beneficial effects on renal hemodynamics in this patient population. To better define the response to dopamine in the clinical setting, we studied the renal effects of low-dose DA in 13 patients having vascular surgery. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) were measured by inulin and p-aminohippurate clearance, respectively. Group I (n = 8) included patients in stable condition after operation who were administered intravenous DA, 0.5 micrograms/kg/min, for 2 hours. RBF significantly increased from 579 +/- 85 to 726 +/- 114 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p less than 0.05). Increases were also observed in GFR (95.0 +/- 10.9 to 107 +/- 15.7 ml/min/1.73 m2), sodium excretion (164 +/- 35 to 239 +/- 53 mu Eq/min), and osmolar excretion (709 +/- 78 to 866 +/- 93 mu Osm/min). There were no changes in urine output (2.17 +/- 0.36 to 2.49 +/- 0.43 ml/min). Group II (n = 5) consisted of patients having abdominal aortic surgery who were treated with DA, 2.0 micrograms/kg/min, before and after surgery. Increases in RBF were seen in both the preoperative period (414 +/- 59 to 659 +/- 96 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.01) and postoperative period (439 +/- 60 to 623 +/- 94 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The spasm was refractory to oral calcium channel blocking agents and direct intraarterial infusion of tolazoline (Priscoline). However, intraarterial nitroglycerin produced a prompt and dramatic improvement in symptoms and in physical and arteriographic findings.

    "abstract": "The existence of inhibitors of plasminogen activator has been shown to play an important role in regulation of fibrinolysis and postoperative thrombosis. Platelets and endothelium are sources of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). This study determines the contribution of platelet-released PAI to perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown. PAI levels were measured in 25 patients having aortic surgery. In nine patients the platelet-released PAI contribution was determined by in vitro activation of platelets with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). Mean preoperative PAI levels (3.78 +/- 1.19 U/ml) were similar to controls (3.01 +/- 1.04 U/ml) (p greater than 0.05). Plasma PAI showed an operative increase to a maximum at 8 hours postoperatively and returning to preoperative values by the second postoperative day. In the nine patients who were subjected to studies with in vitro activation, the preoperative PAI level (4.0 +/- 0.9 U/ml) was elevated to 5.1 +/- 0.7 U/ml (p = 0.001) with PMA induction. Maximum stimulated release of platelet granule contents (platelet releasate) could account for an increase of only 1.0 U/ml compared with a postoperative increase of 2.3 U/ml. Postoperative mean peak plasma PAI (6.3 +/- 0.4 U/ml) could not be further elevated by induced release (6.3 +/- 0.4 U/ml) (p = 0.003). A statistically significant increase in PAI occurred in aortic surgery patients postoperatively. The platelet releasable pool of PAI contributed to the increase and was functionally exhausted postoperatively. Postoperative increases of PAI were twice that induced by platelet in vitro stimulation alone. The perioperative increase in PAI was partly due to platelet release.",

PGI2 formation (expressed as picomoles 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/2-min incubation per sample) by nonatheromatous proximal intima of CES (307 +/- 23, mean +/- standard error) and distal intima of CES (260 +/- 22) was not statistically different; however, it was greater than atheromatous transitional plaque (159 +/- 13 pmol) (p less than 0.01) and ulceration regions (140 +/- 15 pmol) (p less than 0.01) of CES, NAS (204 +/- 16 pmol) (p less than 0.01), and SVS (165 +/- 9 pmol) (p less than 0.01). TxA2 formation (expressed as picomoles TxB2/2-min incubation per sample) by CES ulceration (51 +/- 2 pmol) was low but greater than proximal (17 +/- 2 pmol) (p less than 0.01), distal (19 +/- 3 pmol) (p less than 0.01), and transitional (23 +/- 3 pmol) (p less than 0.01) regions. TxA2 formation by NAS and SVS was not detected (less than 10 pmol). CGS 13080 inhibited TxA2 formation by CES below the limits of detection. Incubation of 1.9 x 10(5) intact platelets with 10 mumol/L of PGH2 formed a quantity of TxA2 equal to that of CES ulceration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Blunt trauma accounts for 3% to 10% of cervical vessel injuries. Death and severe neurologic impairment have been reported in more than 80% of blunt carotid injuries. In our recent experience, 10 patients sustained 18 blunt cervical arterial injuries: two internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections, three ICA transections with pseudoaneurysm, five ICA thromboses, two vertebral artery dissections, one vertebral artery transection with pseudoaneurysm, one vertebral artery thrombosis, one minimal vertebral artery injury, and three caroticocavernous fistulas. A delay of more than 12 hours in making the diagnosis occurred in seven of the 10 patients. The mental status was initially normal in seven patients. The subsequent development of focal neurologic findings incongruent with CT scanning of the head prompted four-vessel angiography. Treatment was individualized and included supportive management, intravenous heparin, ligation, extracranial-intracranial bypass, and radiologic embolization. We have developed an angiographic classification that may aid management. Early angiography in patients with neurologic findings incongruent with head CT scan or in whom a normal sensorium and hemiparesis are present may permit improved outcomes. We advocate direct operative repair for accessible lesions of recent onset. For surgically inaccessible lesions, those with delayed presentation or in some cases with a fixed neurologic deficit, intravenous heparin can be started and follow-up angiography, head CT scanning, and the patient's clinical status determine further therapy.",

    "abstract": "Although complications of balloon catheter embolectomy are infrequent, the injury potential of these catheters is well recognized. This article describes a case of multiple tibial artery pseudoaneurysms that appeared 4 years after embolectomy in a 42-year-old man with otherwise normal arteries. The patient was treated by internal aneurysmorrhaphy without sequelae. A literature review of balloon catheter injuries yielded 46 cases categorized as arterial disruption (29), intimal injury (12), or catheter malfunction (5). These resulted in hemorrhage (13 cases), arteriovenous fistula (12), pseudoaneurysm (four), thrombosis (three), dissection (five), accelerated atherosclerosis (four), and catheter fragment embolism (five). Of these complications, only 41% were recognized during the initial operation. Direct observation detected 32% of these, whereas 68% were shown only by completion arteriography. Complications recognized during initial operation were more frequently asymptomatic without further surgery (84%) than those detected postoperatively (30%, p less than 0.001). Completion arteriography detected 87% of balloon catheter complications compared with only 23% of complications recognized intraoperatively without arteriography (p less than 0.001). We conclude that delicate technique, completion arteriography, prompt surgical treatment, and extended follow-up are important components of balloon catheter embolectomy.",

    "abstract": "Our experience with the management of two patients with life-threatening aortic disease during pregnancy is presented with a review of the literature. One of our patients had intimal disruption caused by trauma; the other had probable Ehlers-Danlos type IV syndrome, causing an acute dissection of the descending thoracic aorta and eventually requiring replacement of the aorta from the left subclavian artery to common iliac arteries. The challenge of treating both the pregnant woman and the fetus was managed successfully by an emergent cesarean section followed by Dacron graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta. The literature reviewed disclosed that aneurysm expansion producing symptoms and dissection is most common during the third trimester and during labor and delivery in patients with or without Marfan's syndrome. Half of the aortic dissections in women less than 40 years of age occur in association with pregnancy. The available evidence indicates that patients with known valvular or aortic disease should have surgical repairs during the first or second trimester and thereafter have delivery by cesarean section. However, patients with acute aortic problems near term appear to be better managed by cesarean section followed promptly by treatment of the aortic disease.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) is a controversial treatment for renal artery stenosis. This article discusses whether or not a prior attempt at PTRA compromises a subsequent elective or emergent surgical revascularization. Thirteen patients had surgical renal artery reconstruction after one or more PTRAs. Eight of the patients were treated because of atherosclerotic renal artery disease whereas five had a form of fibromuscular dysplasia. Five patients had renal artery injury directly related to the angioplasty. Four of these kidneys were saved. Eight patients were treated from 6 to 920 days after PTRA because of recurrent stenosis or occlusion of the renal artery. Only one of these kidneys was lost, an attempt at revascularization of a small kidney that failed to resume function. A prior attempt at PTRA did not compromise the ability of subsequent surgical revascularization to ameliorate hypertension. We conclude that surgical renal revascularization is not made less likely to succeed by a previous attempt at PTRA; even if the renal artery is thrombosed or perforated during the procedure, a reasonable chance of renal salvage is obtained by immediate surgical revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Between 1982 and 1987, 32 patients with severe aortorenal atherosclerosis had simultaneous aortic and bilateral renal revascularization. All patients were hypertensive. Eighteen patients (56%) had renal insufficiency with a mean serum creatinine (SC) of 2.8 mg/dl. Nine patients had an aortic aneurysm; the remaining 23 patients had aortoiliac occlusive disease of varying severity. Aortic reconstruction was done with either a straight (six patients) or bifurcated (26 patients) Dacron graft. Renal revascularization was accomplished with either bypass (60 arteries) or transaortic endarterectomy (four arteries). One patient died of pulmonary embolism (operative mortality rate 3%). Beneficial blood pressure response was achieved in 28 of 31 survivors, (90%). Among the 18 patients with renal insufficiency, mean SC was 2.80 +/- 1.18 mg/dl preoperatively and 1.65 +/- 0.48 mg/dl postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Among eight patients with severe renal dysfunction before surgery (SC greater than 3 mg/dl), mean SC was 3.90 +/- 0.85 mg/dl before and 1.79 +/- 0.69 mg/dl after operation (p less than 0.001). In follow-up extending to 58 months (mean 27.6 months), five late deaths occurred; cumulative survival was 94% at 2 years and 60% at 4 years. There were no instances of worsening hypertension; one patient had deteriorating renal function. These results indicate that severe aortorenal atherosclerosis can be managed with simultaneous aortic reconstruction and bilateral renal revascularization at low operative risk. In addition, there can be high expectation of significant and persisting benefit in both hypertension and renal dysfunction after operation.",

    "abstract": "We report the vascular surgical strategies and results in 13 patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and describe useful in vitro techniques for the evaluation of anticoagulant therapy. Thirteen of 40 patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia had 18 cardiovascular procedures done to save life or limb. Greenfield filters were placed in eight patients to prevent pulmonary embolism. Eight patients had 10 arterial procedures, with alternative anticoagulation that used dextran or warfarin in five cases. In three cases iloprost, a derivative of prostacyclin and a potent platelet inhibitor, was infused intraoperatively and heparin was given. Both the use of alternative anticoagulants and platelet suppression by iloprost were clinically effective strategies. The concurrent measurement of plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinopeptide A in two patients confirmed that both approaches can successfully prevent activation of platelets and plasma coagulation during arterial surgery. One operative death occurred; all vascular reconstructions remained patent at 3 to 6 months. In two patients who received heparin alone for arterial surgery, both procedures resulted in thrombosis and limb loss. When major venous thromboembolism is complicated by heparin-associated thrombocytopenia, insertion of a Greenfield vena cava filter should be considered if there is significant risk of pulmonary embolism. When necessary, arterial surgery is feasible in patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia if alternative anticoagulation or adequate suppression of platelet reactivity can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Controversy still exists concerning the optimal treatment for adventitial cystic disease of the popliteal artery: complete removal of the cyst without arterectomy or arteriectomy with venous replacement. In the two cases presented here, it was possible to completely excise the cyst and to preserve a solid arterial wall despite the magnitude of lesions documented on preoperative angiograms. Good functional and anatomic outcome has been maintained for 5 and 9 years, respectively. According to the available literature on pathologic data, complete cyst excision without arterial reconstruction is often feasible. Our results, as well as those published by others, suggest that short- and long-term outcome is better after complete cyst removal without than that with arterial reconstruction. As most patients are generally young adults, cystic excision should be preferred to venous bypass whenever feasible and whenever the remaining arterial wall seems to be healthy and solid.",

    "abstract": "Internal carotid injuries in zone III near the base of the skull are technically the most challenging of the carotid injuries. Diagnostic angiography is important to evaluate the exact site and extent of injury and the presence or absence of prograde flow in the injured segment. Vascular repair in this area is highly dependent on the adequacy of surgical exposure. Previous approaches have emphasized displacement of the mandible either by subluxation or mandibulotomy. Problems related to mandibulotomy, such as intraoral contamination, infection, and nonunion, are potential complications of this approach to the high carotid artery. In addition, it does not give adequate exposure of the internal carotid artery at the critical area, near the base of the skull. Experience gained from the extended radical neck dissection exposing the internal carotid artery up to the skull base has demonstrated that a posterolateral anatomic approach can provide superior exposure of the high carotid artery with lower morbidity and shortened operative time. This surgical approach involves cutting the sternomastoid muscle close to the mastoid and dissecting all the tissues away from the surface of the mastoid. Dividing the posterior belly of the digastric and styloid group of muscles assists in exposure of the internal carotid artery. Rarely, dissection of the facial nerve and removal of the tail of parotid add additional access to this area. This article describes the stepwise anatomic approach to the internal carotid artery near the base of the skull.",

    "abstract": "A short-term canine model of lower extremity venous hypertension was created to study the hemodynamics of crossfemoral venous bypass grafts (CFB). Specifically, the hemodynamic effects of bypass conduit diameter and adjunctive arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) were investigated. Unilateral hind limb venous hypertension was produced by iliofemoral venous ligation in six groups of five greyhounds each. Group I had venous ligation alone. CFBs were constructed in the remaining five groups: group II, 3 mm bypass conduit alone; group III, 3 mm bypass plus sequential AVF; group IV, 3 mm bypass plus caudad AVF; group V, 3 mm bypass plus cephalad AVF; group VI, 6 mm bypass conduit alone. Venous hypertension was significantly reduced by CFB (group II, p less than 0.025; group VI, p less than 0.001); increasing the diameter of the bypass conduit from 3 to 6 mm produced significantly greater graft flow (p less than 0.05), while completely relieving venous hypertension. Addition of adjunctive AVFs significantly augmented graft flow (p less than 0.001) but tended to aggravate ipsilateral venous hypertension (group III, p less than 0.01; group IV increase, NSS; group V, p less than 0.001). During the 4 hours of pressure monitoring, venous hypertension diminished significantly (p less than 0.05) with the sequential AVF but not with the other AVF. We conclude that (1) AVFs may be required for adequate graft flow if a small-diameter (3 mm) bypass conduit is used to relieve venous hypertension; (2) adjunctive AVFs aggravate venous hypertension; (3) sequential AVFs seem to be the most hemodynamically efficacious; (4) AVFs may not be necessary if a large, isodiametric (6 mm) conduit is used.",

    "abstract": "This study describes a technique that facilitates lower extremity \"redo\" revascularizations and that may increase the number of patients who can be revascularized. By using the distal deep femoral artery for bypass outflow or inflow, we were able to revascularize patients with no other accessible patent major thigh artery, to increase the use of autologous vein for infrapopliteal bypasses, and to avoid difficult groin reoperations. Thirty-seven patients (23 men) had various distal deep femoral revascularizations for limb salvage indications only (rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and/or gangrene). Techniques to expose the distal deep femoral artery directly are described and their uses discussed. We found that the type of bypass performed (e.g., axillofemoral or aortofemoral) determined the patency rate of the reconstruction. Placement of the origin or termination of the graft in the deep femoral artery did not appear to affect the results adversely.",

    "abstract": "Current techniques for treating chronic venous disease caused by venous valve incompetence all have deficiencies. A need exists for a simple technique to restore competence to the diseased valves at multiple sites in the venous system. The Venocuff is an implantable device developed to restore venous valve competence by reducing the vein circumference. Two animal models are described that are useful in the study of venous valve incompetence; the device was tested in these two models in the jugular vein of sheep. The first model was of naturally incompetent valves. The device was implanted around 11 completely incompetent and seven partially incompetent valves in 18 veins of 11 sheep. After implantation competence was restored or improved in all valves. The second model made use of an arteriovenous fistula to produce incompetence in the jugular vein in four sheep. The implant increased the pressure difference across the valve from 16 to 68 mm Hg. The Venocuff implant was thus effective at restoring valvular competence in the two animal models studied. There is evidence that valvular incompetence in these models and the results observed may be applicable in some cases of chronic venous disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "Blunt subclavian artery injury has been uncommonly reported in the literature. Recent encounter with three such injuries prompted us to review our experience over the past 10 years uncovering only one additional case. These four cases and a review of pertinent literature form the basis for this article. Key clinical issues include a high index of suspicion in patients sustaining major blunt deceleration and rotational or direct injuries to the neck, thorax, and/or upper extremities. Prompt diagnosis remains obscured by the presence of severe associated injuries, the treatment of which requires prioritization. Arteriography is invaluable to elucidate injury because prompt vascular control is dictated by various approaches depending on the location. Expeditious surgical repair is indicated to prevent complications of hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, thromboembolism, and/or arteriovenous fistula. Long-term results appear to be good with major morbidity related to associated neurologic, soft tissue, and bony injuries.",

    "abstract": "Superficial temporal artery (STA) aneurysms as a result of trauma represent less than 1% of reported aneurysms. During the past 200 years only the type of trauma and the preferred treatment have significantly changed. Patients are generally young men with a recent history of blunt head trauma. They may complain of a mass, headache, or other vague symptoms. Neurologic defects are rare; however, if a neurologic deficit exists, the physician should consider either arteriography or a head CT scan to search for intracranial pathologic conditions. In most cases the diagnosis may be made by obtaining a complete history and physical examination. The treatment of choice is ligation and resection, which may be accomplished with the patient under local or general anesthesia. In rare instances, arteriography with selective embolization may be useful when the traumatic aneurysm is complicated by severe facial trauma. Three cases of STA aneurysms are presented. The history, pathophysiology, origin, presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of STA aneurysms are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Aortic dissections limited to the abdominal aorta occur infrequently. We have identified four cases of abdominal aortic dissection and have reviewed these in combination with 43 previously reported cases to identify factors that influence the prognosis and management of this disease. Abdominal aortic dissections are similar to thoracic dissections in their presentation, with acute shearing pain and systolic hypertension occurring commonly. Although the diagnosis may be made by ultrasonography or CT scanning, angiography is the definitive diagnostic study. Factors found to be associated with high mortality include presentation with acute pain (p less than 0.0003), involvement of visceral vessels (p less than 0.02), and rupture (p less than 0.000002). Chronicity appears to be protective (p less than 0.04), although chronic dissections may present acutely. Although prosthetic replacement of the involved aorta is the treatment of choice in most cases, nonoperative management with regular follow-up can be considered in asymptomatic chronic dissections.",

Control grafts, control plus parenteral oxacillin, and oxacillin-bonded Dacron grafts were challenged by local inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus. Ninety percent of controls, 80% of parenteral antibiotic recipients, and only 30% of antibiotic-bonded Dacron grafts became infected (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.03). Antibiotic-bonded grafts were also superior in terms of suture line cultures and patency. In separate experiments in a subcutaneous pouch model, antibiotic bonding significantly improved the median infective dose of Dacron over that of controls and Dacron soaked in cephalosporin. These studies demonstrate that antibiotic-bonded Dacron implants are highly resistant to infection. A multicenter clinical trial is planned.",

    "abstract": "The efficacies of standard heparin (SH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and a mixture of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (Org 10172) were investigated with respect to their inhibitory effects on intimal thickening after endothelial injury in the common carotid artery of the rat. The injury was induced by air infusion into an isolated segment of the artery; the pharmacologic agents were administered by continuous intravenous infusion. After 2 weeks the animals were killed and the arteries examined. The control animals developed a marked intimal thickening. A dose-dependent decreases in the intima to media area (I-M) ratio was seen after SH, with approximately 50% and 90% inhibition of intimal thickening at doses of 5 and 50 USP U/kg/hr, respectively. At these effective doses, the effect of SH was associated with reendothelialization of the injured area. The effects of LMWH and Org 10172 were similar to that of SH at doses of 50 anti-Xa U/kg/hr, but these agents had only about 40% inhibition at doses of 15 anti-Xa U/kg/hr. The activated partial thromboplastin times were slightly prolonged in the animals treated with 50 USP/anti-Xa U/kg/hr of SH, LMWH, and Org 10172, whereas significant anti-Xa levels were observed at doses higher than 15 USP/anti-Xa U/kg/hr. It is concluded that SH, LMWH, and Org 10172 have significant inhibitory effects of intimal thickening after injury even at nonanticoagulant levels, with SH being the most potent.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate potential clinical applications of nonautologous fibrin glue (FG) as a hemostatic agent in vascular surgery, we compared its efficacy to oxidized regenerated cellulose (OC) in hemostatically sealing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular graft anastomoses. PTFE grafts (4 mm wide and 4 to 6 cm in length) were placed to each femoral artery in a heparinized canine model, in end-to-end fashion in half of the dogs and in end-to-side fashion in the remaining dogs. Each set of graft-arterial anastomoses was then sealed with either FG or OC, determined randomly, followed by simultaneous measurement of blood loss through the graft anastomoses and needle holes. There was significantly less bleeding from anastomoses sealed with FG compared with those sealed with OC, regardless of whether the anastomoses sealed with FG compared with those sealed with OC, regardless of whether the anastomosis was constructed in end-to-end (p less than 0.03) or end-to-side (p less than 0.004) fashion; overall, the operative blood loss for grafts sealed with FG was 14 +/- 6 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) vs 99 +/- 27 ml/min for those sealed with OC (p less than 0.001). In the early postoperative period, significant groin hematomas occurred more frequently in grafts sealed with OC compared with those sealed with FG. Microscopic examination of graft-arterial specimens harvested at postoperative intervals ranging from 1 day to 3 months revealed no significant inflammatory reaction with either hemostatic agent; after 2 to 3 weeks, paired specimens appeared histologically similar despite previous treatment with either FG or OC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This article is a report on a case of a giant pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery where important features of the diagnosis, with special mention of magnetic resonance imaging and arteriography, are discussed. Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice for these lesions. Historically, proximal arterial control has been the main dilemma in the management of gluteal artery pseudoaneurysm. We found transcatheter embolization to provide optimal control and eliminate the need for preperitoneal or intraabdominal dissection. Surgical repair can then be carried out without risk of intraoperative hemorrhage.",

    "abstract": "The hemodynamic effect of conventional surgery for varicose veins has been evaluated with a new method of air-plethysmography. The functional venous volume of the leg, venous reflux, and calf muscle pump-ejecting capacity have been measured in 42 legs with primary varicose veins. The patients were studied clinically, with Doppler ultrasound, duplex scanning, and phlebography preoperatively. Doppler ultrasound was repeated postoperatively. Air-plethysmography was performed one day before surgery and 8 to 10 days after surgery. A decrease of the functional venous volume of 16% has been observed (p less than 0.001). The abolition of venous reflux has been shown in all the patients. An improvement in the calf muscle pump-ejecting capacity has also been shown, with a 30% increase of the ejection fraction of the calf muscle pump and with a 43% decrease of the residual volume fraction after 10 tiptoe movements (p less than 0.001). The results indicate that this new method of air-plethysmography apart from its diagnostic value offers a new and unique technique for a noninvasive, objective, and quantitative evaluation of the results of established and experimental venous surgery.",

    "abstract": "Various tests are used preoperatively to differentiate patients who require an above-knee amputation (AKA) from those whose vascular supply is adequate to heal a below-knee procedure (BKA). This 15-month study of 109 amputations compared four of these methods: segmental Doppler systolic pressure measurements, transcutaneous oxygen measurement (tcPO2), fluorescein angiography, and skin thermometry. There were 66 BKAs (85% healed primarily) and 43 AKAs (93% healed primarily). The actual level of amputation was determined by the operating surgeon without consideration of the preoperative test results, and the incidence of healing was then related to the test parameters. The average skin temperature at the amputation site was higher (93.7 degrees F) in the group that healed primarily compared with those who required operative stump revision (89.9 degrees F) (p less than 0.001). The mean midcalf tcPO2 was also higher in the BKA group that healed (PO2 = 36.6 mm Hg) compared with those who failed (PO2 = 16.4 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001). Qualitative skin fluorescence was less successful in differentiating success from failure. Of the 63 BKAs that fluorescein predicted would heal, eight failed (13%). Doppler pressures at the thigh, popliteal, midcalf, or ankle level were unreliable in predicting healing of a BKA. Formulation of indexes relating absolute pressures to the brachial systolic pressure did not improve the value of this examination. From this review it is concluded that the skin temperature and tcPO2 obtained at the site of proposed amputation were the most reliable prognostic noninvasive examinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The results of duplex ultrasonography in grading stenosis after carotid endarterectomy (78 sites) were compared with those of contrast angiography in 71 patients studied for recurrent or contralateral occlusive disease of the carotid bifurcation. Duplex and angiographic studies were performed within one month of each other at a mean postoperative interval of 44 months (range 3 to 122 months). Stenosis of the common carotid (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) was classified into five disease categories (normal or less than 15% diameter reduction [DR], 16% to 49% DR, 50% to 75% DR, greater than 75% DR, and occlusion). The overall accuracy of duplex scanning compared with angiography in predicting recurrent carotid bifurcation disease was 83%, a level of agreement similar to classification of disease involving the nonoperated, contralateral bifurcation (overall accuracy 87%). Recurrent stenosis (greater than 50% DR) or occlusion of the CCA or ICA after endarterectomy was identified with an accuracy of 97%. Overestimation of severity of recurrent stenosis accounted for 11 of 13 duplex classification errors (85%). Presence of moderate (30% to 50% DR) recurrent stenosis of the CCA, tortuosity of the ICA, and severe contralateral carotid bifurcation disease were associated with velocity spectra that predicted a more severe recurrent stenosis at the endarterectomy site compared with angiographic grading. The level of agreement between duplex scanning and angiography was comparable to the interobserver variability in angiographic interpretation. The accuracy reported justifies the use of duplex scanning to grade the severity of carotid bifurcation recurrent stenosis and to follow these lesions for disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The hemodynamics of 56 femorodistal saphenous vein bypasses (in situ [n = 53] or reversed [n = 3]) identified to have residual or recurrent graft stenoses were characterized with Doppler-derived blood flow velocity and resting limb systolic pressure measurements. The magnitude and configuration of the graft blood flow velocity waveform were the best predictors of graft stenosis. Transformation of the graft blood flow velocity waveform from a triphasic to a monophasic or biphasic configuration coupled with a low (less than 45 cm/sec) or decrease (greater than 30 cm/sec) in peak systolic blood flow velocity relative to initial postoperative levels reliably predicted the presence of a remote occlusive lesion. In 20 (36%) of the 56 limbs, the ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) did not identify graft stenosis. The low sensitivity of ABI in the identification of graft stenosis was due to insignificant decrease (less than 0.15) of ABI (n = 11), incompressibility of the tibial arteries (n = 6), or residual occlusive lesions after surgery (n = 3). Duplex scanning of grafts with low blood flow velocity localized the site of stenosis in 31 (86%) of 36 patients examined. Graft revision increased systolic blood flow velocity from 33 +/- 9 to 77 +/- 18 cm/sec (mean +/- one standard deviation) a velocity similar to immediate postoperative levels (74 +/- 17 cm/sec). Resting ABI increased from 0.61 +/- 0.2 to 0.92 +/- 0.1 after graft revision. Four grafts with low systolic blood flow velocity (range 18 to 40 cm/sec) not revised occluded 5 to 45 days later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Twenty-four patients, 14 men and 10 women with a mean age of 50 years (range 24 to 72 years), were subjected to duplex imaging and phlebography a mean of 5 years after surgery. Scanning was done with patients in an erect position. A graft was reported as patient if it met the following criteria: it could be imaged in continuity, it could be compressed by the scan probe, and blood flow varied with respiration and was augmented by thigh compression on the symptomatic side. Phlebography indicated that 20 grafts were patent and 17 of these were correctly identified with duplex scanning. Three scans were false negative in obese patients in whom the graft could not be imaged. Four grafts, not imaged, were confirmed by phlebography to be occluded. Compared with phlebography, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 88%. Duplex scanning is safe and accurate way to determine patency after femorofemoral venous bypass if the criteria for patency are fulfilled. If not, the true status of the graft must still be established by phlebography.",

    "abstract": "The risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease appears to be related to the presence of a high-grade stenosis. To determine the prevalence of such lesions, duplex scanning was performed on 348 unselected volunteers without symptoms who attended hospital-sponsored health fairs. There were 209 women and 139 men whose ages ranged from 24 to 91 years. Risk factors included hypertension (37%), diabetes (8%), and smoking (23%). One hundred seven subjects (31%) had evidence of extracranial carotid artery disease, 13 (4%) with greater than 50% stenosis, and three (1%) with greater than 80% stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Bilateral disease was present in 50 patients. Disease prevalence and severity were significantly correlated with age (p less than 0.001) and hypertension (p less than 0.01) but not with diabetes or smoking. The incidence of disease was similar in men and women. Although carotid plaques are common in people older than 50 years of age who do not have symptoms, the prevalence of high-grade stenosis--even in the elderly hypertension population--is low, casting doubt on the cost-effectiveness of generalized screening.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the accuracy of duplex ultrasound in the postoperative follow-up of patients after renal revascularization. Between May 1976 and December 1987, 125 adult patients underwent 153 renal reconstructive procedures for renovascular occlusive disease. Technically satisfactory duplex scans were obtained in 49 of 59 patients (84%) at an average follow-up of 32 months (maximum 11 years). Arteriograms were available for correlation in 51 arteries or bypasses in 36 patients. Duplex scans accurately classified 8 of 10 stenotic (greater than 60% diameter reduction) or occluded vessels and 36 of 41 patent vessels. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 86%, sensitivity was 80%, and specificity was 87%. We confirmed previous reports that decreased diastolic flow correlated with advanced renal parenchymal dysfunction. We conclude that a normal duplex scan makes it highly unlikely that arteriography will reveal significant recurrent disease. An abnormal duplex scan, particularly in the presence of hypertension or deteriorating renal function, warrants arteriography.",

    "abstract": "Increasing recognition of the importance of vein graft stenoses in precipitating failure of femorodistal bypass procedures has stimulated an increasing interest in noninvasive postoperative surveillance. We have used duplex scanning, measuring relative changes in velocity throughout the entire length of the graft, to detect nonhemodynamic stenoses (i.e., stenoses without a significant change in ankle-brachial pressure indexes) as well as more severe lesions during the postoperative period. Seventy-five in situ vein grafts were assessed at three monthly intervals from operation with duplex scanning and intravenous digital subtraction angiography. Nineteen grafts (25%) had angiographically documented stenoses at a mean follow-up of 12 months. All 19 stenoses were detected independently by duplex velocity ratio criteria and 15 were correctly graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The results suggest that duplex-derived velocity ratio criteria are appropriate for graft surveillance and for determining the natural history of even minor stenoses to identify the optimal time of surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Among 42 patients who had undergone portacaval shunt (PCS) to treat bleeding esophageal varices, shunt patency was assessed with duplex sonography 1 month to 5 years postoperatively. Patency was confirmed in all patients (100%). Correlative angiograms confirming the sonographic findings were obtained in 24 patients. Duplex scanning showed hepatofugal or stagnant flow in the distal portal vein in all 42 patients. Very low rates of liver-failure-related mortality (6%) and morbidity (6% incidence of encephaloparthy) in this series despite loss of portal perfusion of the liver in patients incriminate factors other than magnitude and direction of portal vein flow as the cause of complications occurring after PCS. Duplex sonography offers accurate and relevant clinical and physiologic data about shunt hemodynamics in patients who have undergone PCS.",
