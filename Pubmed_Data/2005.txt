    "abstract": "An elderly, widowed man with early dementia has required several surgical procedures for treatment of peripheral vascular disease over the years. Each of the operations has been performed by a single surgeon, for whom the patient and his family have developed enormous respect and admiration. The patient is quite wealthy, and at the urging of his unmarried adult daughter, his guardian, has endowed a professorship and directed that this surgeon be the first appointment to the new position. The surgeon has recently divorced, and soon after he accepts the medical school offer the daughter invites him to dinner alone at her apartment. What should he do?",

    "abstract": "We propose a technique for treating abdominal aortic aneurysm in which first a minilaparotomy (retroperitoneal) is performed to make a conventional arterial dissection; then, video assistance is used to control the left lumbar arteries and to make the aortic anastomosis. This technique can be performed with no significant laparoscopic capability.The patient was installed in a 20-degree right lateral decubitus. A transverse left 8- to 10-cm abdominal incision was made, followed by separation of the muscular structures. Retroperitoneal control of the proximal aortic neck and of both common iliac arteries was obtained by digital and instrumental dissection. A 30-degree laparoscope was then introduced through a 8- to 12-mm trocar and provided the light and magnification that facilitated the dissection of the posterior wall of the aortic neck and of the left flank of the aneurysm, looking for the lumbar arteries to be clipped. A suspended running suture to make the aorto-prosthetic anastomosis was facilitated by the magnification of the camera, especially during the passage of needles. Between March and September 2001, 32 patients fulfilled the anatomic conditions: an infrarenal aortic neck length of 2 cm or more, absence of hypogastric artery aneurysm, and no need for inferior mesenteric artery reimplantation. In 30 patients, the surgery was performed by using the planned minimally invasive approach, and extension of the incision was necessary in two patients.",

Supportive therapy is the treatment offered to most patients, often with poor symptom control. Patients have had to learn to cope with the sequelae of the syndrome and to accept lifelong disability and pain. This may no longer be the case, because endovascular procedures have emerged as a promising alternative for treatment of chronic IVC occlusion. We present 2 case reports of long-standing long-segment IVC occlusion successfully treated with endovascular procedures that incorporated progressive balloon dilation and stenting. The remarkably rapid relief of pain and swelling and overall improvement in quality of life warrants attempts to correct the condition in other patients with IVC occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endovenous laser therapy (ELT) have emerged as percutaneous minimally invasive procedures for ablation of incompetent great saphenous veins in patients with varicosity and venous insufficiency. Early reports showed safety and efficacy of both techniques, with excellent technical success rates and few major complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. During our initial experience with ELT in 56 limbs of 41 patients, 39 underwent postoperative duplex scanning. We encountered three cases (7.7%) with thrombus extension into the common femoral vein. All three patients were anticoagulated, and a temporary inferior vena cava filter was placed in one. All remained asymptomatic. The thrombus resolved by 1 month in all three patients. Review of the literature revealed that the incidence of thrombus extension into the common femoral vein or deep vein thrombosis in published clinical series is 0.3% after ELT and 2.1% after RFA. This possibility warrants routine postoperative duplex scanning, more alertness during these procedures, and patient education on this possible complication.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the effect of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia on a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft seeded with smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nSMCs retrovirally transduced with tPA and eNOS genes were seeded on PTFE grafts and then implanted into the infrarenal rabbit aorta. Thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia on the grafts were examined after 30 and 100 days of implantation.\nAt 30 days of implantation, thrombus was observed on the luminal surface of both unseeded and SMC seeded control grafts, whereas grafts seeded with SMCs secreting tPA were nearly free of thrombus. At 100 days, the neointima on grafts seeded with tPA transduced SMCs was significantly thicker (925 +/- 150 microm, n = 5) than neointima on the other grafts (range, 132 to 374 microm; P < .001). Neointima thickness on grafts seeded with eNOS transduced SMCs (154 +/- 27 microm) was similar to that of unseeded grafts (132 +/- 16 microm, P > .05); both were thinner than those on grafts seeded with SMCs transduced with only lacZ gene (287 +/- 35 microm). The ratio of seeded cells in the neointima was significantly higher on SMC/tPA grafts (46% +/- 8%) than SMC/NOS grafts (21% +/- 6%, P < .05), indicating tPA transduced cells proliferated more than eNOS transduced cells.\nEngineered tPA expression in seeded SMCs causes significantly more neointimal hyperplasia, despite the favorable inhibition of luminal thrombus. eNOS expression in the seeded cells inhibits neointimal hyperplasia.",

Neointima thickness on grafts seeded with eNOS transduced SMCs (154 +/- 27 microm) was similar to that of unseeded grafts (132 +/- 16 microm, P > .05); both were thinner than those on grafts seeded with SMCs transduced with only lacZ gene (287 +/- 35 microm).

    "abstract": "Vascular remodeling in response to injury or low shear stress (or both) is characterized by neointimal hyperplasia and luminal contraction. When profound, the response leads to restenosis after percutaneous endovascular intervention as well as to de novo stenosis in vein grafts. It has recently been reported that exposure of vein patches to neurovirulence-attenuated Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) decreases neointimal hyperplasia and increases luminal area. This experiment tested the hypothesis that R7020, a more highly attenuated mutant of HSV-1, would modulate the vascular remodeling response of experimental vein grafts chronically exposed to low shear stress.\nThe external jugular veins of 31 New Zealand white rabbits were clamped and intraluminally exposed to vehicle (phospate-buffered saline solution, n = 11), R7020 2.5 x 10(8) plaque forming units [PFU]/mL (n = 8), or R7020 2.5 x 10(9) PFU/mL (n = 12) for 10 or 30 minutes at an average pressure of 80 mm Hg. After exposure, an end-to-side distal external jugular-to-common carotid artery anastomosis was created, resulting in a widely patent arteriovenous fistula. The external jugular was suture-ligated just proximal to the thoracic inlet, distal to a small 10- to 50-microm venous tributary, creating a reversed vein \"graft\" segment immediately and abruptly exposed to arterial pressure (48 +/- 3 mm Hg) and low shear stress (0.12 +/- .02 dyne/cm(2)). In the 29 animals (N = 31) that survived to harvest, 26 grafts were found to be patent and were analyzed further. Nine grafts were harvested within the first week after operation, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and assayed for the presence of the Herpes viral immediate-response protein ICP0 by Western blot analysis. The 17 remaining grafts were perfusion-fixed, excised, stained, and analyzed morphometrically by digital planimetry.\nIn patent grafts, the hemodynamic environment of low shear stress was maintained (shear stress at harvest, 0.26 +/- .06 dyne/cm(2)). Western blot analysis revealed the presence of ICP0 in R7020-exposed vein grafts after 2, 3, 7, and 14 days; ICP0 was not detected in unexposed vein grafts or adjacent carotid arteries. After 4 weeks, vein grafts exposed to R7020 exhibited a statistically significantly increased ratio of luminal radius to wall thickness, indicating altered remodeling (vehicle, 6.7 +/- 1.3; R7020 2.5 x 10(8), 9.1 +/- 1.3; R7020 2.5 x 10(9) ratio, 11.3 +/- 1.4; P < .05 for high dose compared with vehicle).\nA brief exposure of the neurovirulence-attenuated HSV-1 strain R7020 results in an increased ratio of luminal radius to wall thickness in experimental vein grafts chronically exposed to low shear stress.",

    "abstract": "Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), similar to estrogens, possess vasoprotective effects by reducing release of reactive oxygen species. Little is known about the potential effects of SERMs on the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). This study's objective was to investigate the growth of experimental AAAs in the setting of the SERM tamoxifen.\nIn the first set of experiments, adult male rats underwent subcutaneous tamoxifen pellet (delivering 10 mg/kg/day) implantation (n = 14) or sham operation (n = 16). Seven days later, all animals underwent pancreatic elastase perfusion of the abdominal aorta. Aortic diameters were determined at that time, and aortas were harvested 7 and 14 days after elastase perfusion for immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and zymography. In the second set of experiments, a direct irreversible catalase inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT), was administered intraperitoneally (1 mg/kg) daily to tamoxifen-treated (n = 6) and control rats (n = 6), starting on day 7 after elastase perfusion. Aortic diameters were measured on day 14. In a third set of experiments, rats were perfused with catalase (150 mg/kg) after the elastase (n = 5), followed by daily intravenous injections of catalase (150 mg/kg/day) administered for 10 days. A control group of rats (n = 7) received 0.9% NaCl instead of catalase.\nMean AAA diameters were approximately 50% smaller in tamoxifen-treated rats compared with sham rats 14 days after elastase perfusion (P = .002). The tamoxifen-treated group's aortas had a five-fold increase in catalase mRNA expression (P = .02) on day 7 and an eight-fold increase in catalase protein on day 14 (P = .04). Matrix metalloprotroteinase-9 activity was 2.4-fold higher (P = .01) on day 7 in the aortas of the controls compared to the tamoxifen-treated group's aortas. Tamoxifen-treated rats had approximately 40% fewer aortic polymorphonuclear neutrophils compared to controls on day 7 (P = .05). Administration of the direct catalase inhibitor AT to tamoxifen-treated rats partially reversed the aneurysm inhibitory effect of tamoxifen by nearly 30% (P = .02). In contrast, catalase administration inhibited AAA formation by 44% (P = .002).\nThe selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen inhibits the development of AAAs in male rats in association with an up-regulation of catalase and inhibition of aortic wall neutrophil infiltration.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a source of morbidity after thoracoabdominal aortic reconstruction. These studies were designed to determine whether PJ34, a novel ultrapotent inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) could modulate neurologic injury after thoracic aortic ischemia reperfusion (TAR) in a murine model of SCI.\nForty-one anesthetized male mice were subject to thoracic aortic occlusion (11 minutes) through a cervical mediastinotomy followed by 48 hours of reperfusion (TAR) under normothermic conditions. PJ34-treated mice (PJ, n = 12) were given 10 mg/kg PJ34 intraperitoneally 1 hour before ischemia and 1 hour after unclamping. The control group (UN, n = 21) received normal saline intraperitoneally 1 hour before ischemia and 1 hour after unclamping. Sham animals (n = 10) were subject to thoracic aortic exposure with no aortic clamping and similar intraperitoneal normal saline injections. PARP-1-/- (KO, n = 8) mice were subjected to the same conditions as the UN mice. Blinded observers rated murine neurologic status after TAR by using an established rodent paralysis scoring system. Murine spinal cords were subjected to cytokine (GRO-1) protein analysis as a marker of inflammation and immunohistochemical analysis (hematoxylin-eosin and PAR staining). Paralysis scores (PS) and GRO-1 levels were compared with analysis of variance, and survival data were compared with chi 2 .\nImmediately after TAR, UN and PJ mice had severe neurologic dysfunction (PS = 5.8 +/- 0.1 and 4.6 +/- 0.6, respectively; P > .05), which was significantly worse than the KO mice (PS = 1.0 +/- 0.7, P < .001). After 6, 24, and 48 hours KO mice had no discernable neurologic injury (PS = 0). Six hours after TAR, PJ mice significantly improved (PS = 1.1 +/- 0.73, P < .001) and remained improved at 24 (PS = 0.7 +/- 0.6) and 48 hours (PS = 0.6 +/- 0.6). UN mice did not improve their PS, and Sham mice showed no neurologic abnormality at any time during these experiments. The mortality at 48 hours was 0% for PJ and KO mice, 43% for UN (P = .012), and 0% for Sham. GRO-1 levels were significantly decreased in PJ and KO versus UN mice (UN, 583 +/- 119 vs PJ, 5.8 +/- 0 vs KO, 5.3 +/- 1.4 mg/pg; P < .0001). Immunohistochemistry showed evidence of decreased PAR staining and ventral motor neuron injury in PJ mice.\nGenetic deletion of PARP or inhibition of its activity (PJ34) rescued neurologic function in mice subjected to TAR. PARP inhibition might represent a novel therapeutic approach for prevention of SCI after TAR.",

Phosphorylation of p70S6K was also assayed after S-1-P treatment in the presence and absence of inhibitors of PI3 kinase (wortmannin, WN, and LY294002, LY), Akt (AktI), p38(MAPK) (SB203580), and MEK1 (PD98059).\nS-1-P stimulated migration of SMCs in both linear wound and Boyden chamber assays compared to control (P < .05); these responses were inhibited by rapamycin to below the level of control (P < .05 vs S-1-P alone for both assays) in a dose-dependent manner (inhibitory concentration of 50%, 10 nmol/L). S-1-P stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38(MAPK), and p70S6K, which peaked at 5 minutes for ERK1/2 and p38(MAPK) and10 minutes for p70S6K (2-fold increase over control for each, P < .05). Rapamycin prevented the phosphorylation of p70S6K at the Thr 389 site (which correlates with enzyme activity), reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but had no effect on the Thr 421/Ser 424 site or on p38(MAPK) phosphorylation. Wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of the Thr 389 site of p70S6K. AktI and SB203580 had no effect on p70S6K, whereas PD98059 had a marginal effect.\nS-1-P-induced SMC migration was completely inhibited by rapamycin, indicating that the p70S6K pathway is involved. This mechanism likely involves modulation of the ERK1/2 pathway. S-1-P stimulates phosphorylation of p70S6K in a MEK1-dependent, PI3 kinase-dependent, but Akt-independent manner.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated whether the simultaneous application of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) enhances blood vessel formation in murine ischemic hindlimb compared with bFGF or HGF applied alone.\nUnilateral hindlimb ischemia was created in C57BL/6 mice. Hindlimb blood flow was evaluated by laser Doppler perfusion image index (LDPII) (ratio (%) of ischemic-to-normal-limb blood flow). The ischemic limbs were treated with bFGF and HGF separately, or bFGF and HGF together, and their therapeutic effects were assessed. Collagen microspheres (CM) were used as a sustained-release carrier for bFGF and HGF.\nA single intramuscular injection of 5 microg or less of bFGF-incorporated CM (bFGF/CM) into the ischemic limb did not significantly increase the LDPII compared with the control (no treatment) 4 weeks after the treatment. Similarly, 20 microg or less of HGF/CM did not increase LDPII. Based on these results, we compared the dual release of CM incorporating 5 microg of bFGF and 20 microg of HGF with either the single release of 5 mug of bFGF/CM alone or 20 microg of HGF/CM alone. The LDPII of the dual release (94.2% +/- 10.9%) was higher than either single release (51.2% +/- 5.8% or 52.5% +/- 8.0%, P < .01). Furthermore, the LDPII in the dual release (94.2% +/- 10.9%) was equivalent to that with 80 microg of bFGF/CM (95.1% +/- 7.6%) alone or 80 microg of HGF/CM (92.8% +/- 7.6%) alone. A histologic evaluation at 4 weeks showed capillary density in the dual release (868 +/- 173 vessels/mm(2)) was higher than that in either single release (204 +/- 68 vessels/mm(2) or 185 +/- 98 vessels/mm(2) , P < .01). The percentage of mature vessels assessed by alpha-smooth muscle actin staining was also higher in the dual release (43.8% +/- 7.8% vs 9.5% +/- 3.0% or 11.7% +/- 3.8%, respectively; P < .01).\nThis study demonstrates that the sustained dual release of a lower dose of bFGF and HGF from a carrier matrix can achieve equivalent blood perfusion recovery and more mature vasculature in the ischemic limb than a higher dose of bFGF or HGF alone. This approach may be a highly promising strategy for the future treatment of peripheral vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The re-establishment of patency in a stenosed or thrombosed native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is fundamental to regaining adequate hemodialysis through the same cannulable vein. Many surgeons have been reluctant to use even small segments of synthetic grafts in AVF revisions because of a perception that these would lead to poor results; however, studies comparing various treatment options are scarce. This study compared the use of short (<6 cm) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) segments with pure autologous repair in stenosed or thrombosed native fistulas.\nThe cumulative postintervention primary patency rates of two groups of hemodialysis patients receiving different surgical revision operations of their vascular accesses were prospectively compared. Group I (n = 30) comprised patients who presented with stenosed or thrombosed native fistulas and received short (2 to 6 cm) interposition PTFE grafts placed after the stenosed or thrombosed outflow vein segment was resected. These short PTFE grafts were not used for cannulation. Group II (n = 29) comprised patients who presented with dysfunctional or failed AVFs and underwent various types of pure autogenous corrections. AVF dysfunction or thrombosis was detected with clinical examination and color duplex ultrasound scanning. In all cases, on-table arteriography-fistulography was performed before surgical repair. Access adequacy was assessed in all patients postoperatively after the first puncture and every month thereafter (mean follow up 16.7 months).\nNo statistically significant difference in patency was observed between the two groups. Postintervention cumulative patencies were 100%, 88%, and 82% for group I and 90%, 82%, and 71% for group II at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively ( P = .8).\nShort (<6 cm) interposition PTFE segments used for the revision of failing or failed AVFs compare favorably to purely native repair and do not alter the autologous behavior of the initial access. These short PTFE revisions resulted in satisfactory midterm primary patency without further consumption of the venous capital by harvesting segments of vein from other locations and without compromising more proximal access sites. This practice is recommended and is justified as part of an aggressive access salvage policy addressed by many authors so far.",

Autopsy protocols coded for intestinal ischemia or mesenteric vessel occlusion, or both, were identified in a database. In all, 997 of 23,446 clinical and 9 of 7,569 forensic autopsy protocols were analyzed. A 3-year sample of the surgical procedures, comprising 21.3% (11,985 of 56,251) of all operations performed during the entire study period, was chosen to capture trends of diagnostic and surgical activity. In a nested case-control study within the clinical autopsy cohort, four MVT-free controls, matched for gender, age at death, and year of death were identified for each fatal MVT case to evaluate the clinical autopsy findings.\nFour forensic and 23 clinical autopsies demonstrated MVT with intestinal infarction. Seven patients were operated on, of whom six survived. The cause-specific mortality ratio was 0.9:1000 autopsies. The incidence was 1.8/100,000 person years. At autopsy, portal vein thrombosis and systemic venous thromboembolism occurred in 2 of 3 and 1 of 2 of the cases, respectively. Obesity was an independent risk factor for fatal MVT (P =.021).\nThe estimated incidence of MVT with transmural intestinal infarction was 1.8/100,000 person years. Portal vein thrombosis, systemic venous thromboembolism and obesity were associated with fatal MVT.",

    "abstract": "We present our experience with surgical treatment of arterial complications in Behcet disease (vasculo-Behcet disease), and the long-term results and pitfalls of surgical treatment.\nBetween January 1990 and January 2003, 20 consecutive patients underwent surgery to treat vasculo-Behcet disease. Most patients (17 of 20) were men, with mean age of 38.4 years.\nThirty-four operations were performed in 20 patients. The operative mortality rate was 5.8% (2 patients). There were 17 emergency operations, 6 because of ruptured primary abdominal aneurysms. There were five others with critical limb ischemia, resulting in 3 amputations. All patients were followed up postoperatively on average for 44 months (range, 6 months-14 years). Two additional patients were lost to follow-up. After the initial operation 10-year survival rate was 30%, 10-year complication-free survival rate was 13%, and 5-year repeat operation-free survival rate was 26%.\nAlthough surgical intervention should be postponed until active inflammation has subsided, often this is not possible, because of the emergent nature of these problems. Most arterial complications of vasculo-Behcet disease present with a pseudoaneurysm rupture or with impending rupture. An aggressive surgical approach can be life-saving in such instances, and should be undertaken regardless of long-term complications, which are more common when the operation is performed in the presence of active inflammation. Early and late results can be improved by individualizing, selecting a disease-free area for reconstruction, and eliminating use of autologous graft material.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial reconstruction frequently have increased cardiac risk factors. Diabetic patients are often asymptomatic despite advanced cardiac disease. This study investigates whether preoperative cardiac testing improves the outcome in diabetic patients at risk for cardiac disease.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing lower-extremity arterial reconstructions in a 32-month period from July 1999 to February 2002. Of the 433 patients identified undergoing 539 procedures, 295 had diabetes mellitus and considered in this study. The patients were stratified into two groups according to the present American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) algorithm. We identified 140 patients with two or more of ACC (Eagle) criteria who met the inclusion criteria for a preoperative cardiac evaluation. These patients were separated into two groups: those undergoing a cardiac work-up (WU) according to the ACC/AHA algorithm and those not undergoing the recommended work-up (NWU). Outcomes included perioperative mortality, postoperative myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and length of hospitalization. Significance of association was assessed by the Fisher exact test. Length of hospitalization was compared using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Survival data was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nOne hundred forty patients met the criteria for moderate risk. There were 61 patients in the NWU group and 79 in the WU group. Ten patients in the WU group underwent preoperative coronary revascularization (6 had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, 4 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting). There was no difference between perioperative mortality (WU, 1%; NWU, 2%; P = 1.00) or in postoperative cardiac morbidity, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia requiring treatment (WU, 5%; NWU, 6%; P = .71). There were no perioperative deaths and one episode of congestive heart failure in the group that had preoperative coronary revascularization. Median length of hospitalization was 10 days in the WU group and 8 days in the NWU group ( P = .11). Patient survival at 12 months for the NWU, WU, and revascularized groups was 85.3%, 78.5%, and 80.0%, respectively; 36-month survival was 73.6%, 62.9%, and 80.0%, respectively. The three survival curves did not differ significantly ( P = .209).\nPreoperative cardiac evaluation, as defined by the ACC/AHA algorithm, does not predict or improve postoperative morbidity, mortality, or 36-month survival in asymptomatic, diabetic patients undergoing elective lower-extremity arterial reconstruction. These data do not support the current ACC/AHA recommendations as a standard of care for diabetic patients with an intermediate clinical predictor who undergo peripheral arterial reconstruction, a high-risk surgical procedure.",

Arterial allografts were harvested from multiple organ donors and cryopreserved at -80 degrees C. The patients were observed for survival, limb salvage, persistence or recurrence of infection, and allograft patency. The results were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nDuring the 7-year study period, 17 patients (14 men, 3 women; mean age, 68 years) with major peripheral graft infection underwent graft excision and cryopreserved arterial allograft reconstruction. Eight patients (47%) had systemic sepsis, 5 (29%) had acute ischemia at the time of the allograft reconstruction, and 9 (53%) had experienced anastomotic rupture. Allograft reconstruction was performed as an emergency procedure in 7 patients (41%). There were no perioperative deaths or early amputations. Two patients had allograft ruptures in the groin during the early postoperative period. The mean follow-up period was 34 months (range, 8 to 80 months). There was no persistent or recurrent infection, and none of the patients received long-term (>3 months) antibiotic therapy. Reoperation for allograft revision, excision, or replacement was performed in 2 patients. The 18-month primary and secondary allograft patency rates were 68% and 86%; the overall limb salvage rate was 82% at 2 years.\nOur experience with cryopreserved arterial allograft in the management of major peripheral bypass graft infection suggests that this technique seems to be a useful option for treating one of the most dreaded vascular complications.",

There was no persistent or recurrent infection, and none of the patients received long-term (>3 months) antibiotic therapy. Reoperation for allograft revision, excision, or replacement was performed in 2 patients. The 18-month primary and secondary allograft patency rates were 68% and 86%; the overall limb salvage rate was 82% at 2 years.",

    "abstract": "The published results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) patients are contradictory, mostly because of the relatively small number of patients in these studies. To better assess the neurologic complications and mortality, we reviewed a recent and substantially larger series of CRI patients who underwent CEAs.\nFrom March 2000 to March 2003, 675 consecutive primary CEAs were performed in 609 patients (346 men, 57%) under general anesthesia. Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis accounted for 71% of cases. CRI (serum creatinine level > or = 1.5 mg/dL) was detected in 166 patients (27%) who underwent 184 CEAs. The remaining 443 patients (73%) had 491 CEAs.\nPatients with CRI were different in age (76 +/- 8 years vs 72 +/- 9 years, P < .001), male gender (73% vs 51%, P < .001), coronary artery disease (50% vs 28%, P < .001), and diabetes mellitus incidence (38% vs 27%, P < .02). No significant difference in stroke rates was observed between the CRI patients and the control group (1.2% vs 0.5%). The mortality rate for CRI patients was 3%, whereas it was 0% for the control group ( P < .002). The 143 CRI patients with serum creatinine levels from 1.5 to 2.9 mg/dL had a 0.7% mortality rate, whereas it was 17% for 23 patients with serum creatinine levels of 3 mg/dL or more ( P < .001). The stroke rate for the former group was 0.7% and 4.3% for the latter group (NS). Asymptomatic (16) and symptomatic (7) patients with serum creatinine levels of 3 mg/dL or more had mortality rates of 13% and 28%, respectively, with P = .6.\nThe high mortality rate observed in patients with serum creatinine levels of 3 mg/dL or more after CEA calls for a nonoperative approach in the management of asymptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is one of the treatment options for localized obstruction of the subclavian artery. To document long-term durability of this kind of PTA we report a 10-year single-center experience in 110 patients.\nFrom January 1993 to July 2003, 110 patients (72 women; mean age, 62 +/- 10 years) underwent PTA of symptomatic (>75%) stenosis (n = 90) or occlusion of the proximal subclavian artery (84 left-sided). Forty one patients (37%) had symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, 29 patients (26%) had disabling chronic arm ischemia, and 20 patients had both symptoms. Twenty patients with coronary artery disease underwent PTA in preparation for myocardial revascularization with the internal mammary artery. Duplex scans and arteriograms confirmed significant stenosis or occlusion. All PTA procedures were performed with the patient under local anesthesia, through the femoral artery (n = 89), brachial artery (n = 6), or combined route (n = 15). In 59 patients (58%) an additional stent was placed.\nAngioplasty was initially technically and clinically successful in 102 patients (93%). Seven occlusions could not be recanalized, and 1 procedure had to be stopped because of ischemic stroke. Of the 102 patients in whom treatment was successful, 1 patient (1%) had a minor stroke in the contralateral hemisphere 2 hours post-PTA. Seven patients (7%) had minor problems, all without permanent sequelae. Follow-up with duplex scanning ranged from 3 months to 10 years (mean, 34 months). Primary clinical patency at 5 years was 89%, with a median recurrent obstruction-free period of 23 months. The local complication rate was 4.5%, and the combined stroke and death rate was 3.6%. Significant recurrent obstruction (>70%) developed in 8 patients with clinical symptoms. Four stenoses were successfully treated with repeat PTA (2 with additional stent placement); 4occlusions required surgery.\nPTA of obstructive lesions of the proximal subclavian artery is not only an effective initial treatment, but is also successful over the long-term. Inasmuch as all clinical failures occured within 26 months after initial therapy, we recommend regular follow-up for at least 2 years post-PTA. All clinically significant recurrent stenoses can be treated with repeat endovascular procedures. We could not prove positive or negative influence of additional placement of stents; however, the number of recurrent stenoses might be too small in this retrospective study to draw firm conclusions. Adverse events of any kind are certainly no greater than with invasive surgical procedures. Therefore PTA must be seriously considered in patients with localized obstruction of the proximal subclavian artery.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to differentiate type II lumbar endoleaks on the basis of dynamic features identified by contrast-enhanced ultrasound scanning (CUS) and to evaluate the role of this differentiation in detecting abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) enlargement > or =1 mL/mo.\nEighteen male patients (mean age, 71.8 years) with type II lumbar endoleak suspected at CUS underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). On CTA, AAA volumes and endoleak visualization and volume were assessed. At CUS, performed after a bolus of 1.5 to 2.4 mL of a second generation blood pool contrast agent, the following parameters were evaluated: presence of contrast material within the aneurysmal sac (endoleak), delay of endoleak detection (wash-in) and disappearance (washout) from the beginning of contrast injection, visualization of inflow and outflow vessels, and presence of cavity filling. Statistical analysis was performed regarding endoleak features at CUS, endoleak detection at CTA, and rate of AAA enlargement.\nDSA confirmed all the endoleaks. Mean +/- standard deviation wash-in and washout times were 121.9 +/- 132.6 and 337.2 +/- 193.7 seconds, respectively; a significant relation was observed between these two parameters (P < .01, analysis of variance). By Youden plots, endoleaks were classified as hyperdynamic when wash-in was <100 seconds (n = 10, 55.5%) and/or washout was <520 seconds (n = 13, 72.2%). A slower washout was associated with nonvisualized outflow (66.7%) and/or inflow arteries (66.7%) ( P < .05). Eight endoleaks (44.4%) were missed at CTA; it occurred in hypodynamic endoleaks, absence of detectable inflow or outflow vessels, and absence of cavity filling at CUS (P < .05). Overall mean AAA volume increase rate was 1.1 +/- 1.7 mL/mo. By multiple logistic regression model, the washout time > or = 520 seconds was the only independent predictor of AAA volume increase > or = 1 mL/mo (8 patients, 44.4%).\nType II lumbar endoleaks show different hemodynamic features at CUS, which might influence the rate of aneurysm enlargement, addressing the need for treatment.",

The GORE TAG endoprosthesis, an investigational nitinol-supported expanded polytetrafluoroethylene tube graft with diameters of 26 to 40 mm, is the first DTA device to enter phase II trials in the United States and has been used worldwide for a host of thoracic pathologies.\nA multicenter prospective nonrandomized phase II study of the GORE TAG endoprosthesis was conducted at 17 sites. Enrollment was from September 1999 to May 2001. Preoperative workup included arteriography and spiral computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Follow-up radiographs and computed tomography scans were obtained at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter.\nA total of 139 (98%) of 142 patients had a successful implantation of the device. Inadequate arterial access was responsible for the 3 failures. The mean DTA size was 64.1 +/- 15.4 mm. Men slightly outnumbered women (57.7%), with an average age of 71 years, and 88% of the patients were white. Ninety percent were American Society of Anesthesiologists category III or IV. One device was used in 44% of patients, and 56% required two or more devices to bridge the thoracic aorta. The left subclavian artery was covered in 28 patients, with planned carotid-subclavian transposition. The procedure time averaged 150 minutes, estimated blood loss averaged 506 mL, intensive care unit stay averaged 2.6 days, and hospital stay averaged 7.6 days. Within 30 days, 45 (32%) patients had at least 1 major adverse event: 5 (4%) experienced a stroke, 4 (3%) demonstrated temporary or permanent paraplegia, 20 (14%) experienced vascular trauma or thrombosis, and 2 (1.5%) died. Mean follow-up was 24.0 months. Four patients had aneurysm-related deaths. Three patients underwent endovascular revisions for endoleak. No ruptures have been reported. Twenty wire fractures have been identified in 19 patients; 18 (90%) of these occurred in the longitudinal spine, and only 1 patient required treatment. At 2 years, aneurysm-related and overall survival rates are 97% and 75%, respectively.\nThe GORE TAG thoracic endoprosthesis provides a safe alternative for the treatment of DTAs, with low mortality, relatively low morbidity, and excellent 2-year freedom from aneurysm-related death. Longitudinal spine fractures have so far been associated with rare clinical events.",

    "abstract": "Artificial blood vessels composed of viable tissue represent the ideal vascular graft. Compliance, lack of thrombogenicity, and resistance to infections as well as the ability to heal, remodel, contract, and secrete normal blood vessel products are theoretical advantages of such grafts. Three basic elements are generally required for the construction of an artificial vessel: a structural scaffold, made either of collagen or a biodegradable polymer; vascular cells, and a nurturing environment. Mechanical properties of the artificial vessels are enhanced by bioreactors that mimic the in vivo environment of the vascular cells by producing pulsatile flow. Alternative approaches include the production of fibrocollagenous tubes within the recipient's own body (subcutaneous tissue or peritoneal cavity) and the construction of an artificial vessel from acellular native tissues, such as decellularized small intestine submucosa, ureter, and allogeneic or xenogeneic arteries. This review details the most recent developments on vascular tissue engineering, summarizes the results of initial experiments on animals and humans, and outlines the current status and the challenges for the future.",

The patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities and complex aneurysm morphology not amenable to endovascular repair. In both cases complete thrombosis of the aneurysm was verified by computed tomography. Both patients are alive at follow-up without evidence of an increase in aneurysm size, postoperative leak, or rupture or impairment of renal function. To our knowledge these are the first reported cases in which this modality has been successfully used in patients presenting with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Earlier results of nonresectional therapy for abdominal aortic aneurysm have reported a significant incidence of postoperative aneurysm rupture and renal failure. Growing experience at our institution with nonresectional therapy for high risk patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms suggests that nonresectional therapy can be a valuable treatment modality for high risk patients including those with contained rupture of the aneurysm who are hemodynamically stable.",

We report on two cases in which limb viability was maintained by using endovascular native vessel recanalization after excision of infected prosthetic grafts. This approach was successful in maintaining adequate limb perfusion in both cases.

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration is critical to the development of atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia. Hemodynamic forces such as shear stress and cyclic strain stimulate endothelial cell signal-transduction pathways, resulting in the secretion of several factors, including SMC chemoattractants such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We hypothesized that mechanical forces stimulate endothelial cells to secrete SMC chemoattractants to induce migration via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.\nBovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to shear stress, cyclic strain, or static conditions for 16 hours. The resulting conditioned medium was used as a SMC chemoattractant in a Boyden chamber. Activation of SMC extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was assessed by Western blot analysis. Pathways were inhibited with anti-PDGF-BB or anti-interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) antibodies, or the ERK1/2 upstream pathway inhibitor PD98059.\nConditioned medium from endothelial cells exposed to shear stress corresponding to arterial levels of shear stress stimulated SMC migration but lower levels of shear stress or cyclic strain did not. Both PDGF-BB and IL-1alpha were secreted into the conditioned medium by endothelial cells stimulated with shear stress. Both PDGF-BB and IL-1alpha stimulated SMC chemotaxis but were not synergistic, and both stimulated SMC ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PDGF-BB or IL-1alpha inhibited SMC chemotaxis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.\nShear stress stimulates endothelial cells to secrete several SMC chemoattractants, including PDGF-BB and IL-1alpha; both PDGF-BB and IL-1alpha stimulate SMC chemotaxis via the ERK1/2 signal-transduction pathway. These results suggest that the response to vascular injury may have a common pathway amenable to pharmacologic manipulation.\nOne difficulty in the pharmacologic treatment of atherosclerosis or neointimal hyperplasia leading to restenosis is the multiplicity of activated pathways and thus potential treatment targets. This study demonstrates that shear stress, a hemodynamic force that may be a biologically relevant stimulus to induce vascular pathology, stimulates endothelial cells to secrete PDGF-BB and IL-1alpha. Both of these mediators stimulate the SMC ERK1/2 pathway to induce migration, a critical event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia. Therefore, this study suggests a relevant common target pathway in SMC that is amenable to manipulation for clinical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Current experimental models of critical limb ischemia are based on acute ischemia rather than on chronic ischemia. Human peripheral vascular disease is largely a result of chromic ischemia. We hypothesized that a model of chronic hindlimb ischemia would develop more collateral arteries, more blood flow, and less necrosis and inflammation than would acute hindlimb ischemia. We therefore developed a rat model of chronic hindlimb ischemia and compared the effects of chronic ischemia with those of acute ischemia on hindlimb skeletal muscle.\nAcute or chronic ischemia was induced in 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Chronic ischemia caused blood flow, as measured by laser Doppler scanning and confirmed by muscle oxygen tension measurements, to gradually decrease over 1 to 2 weeks after operation.\nHistologic analysis showed chronic hindlimb ischemia better preserved muscle mass and architecture and stimulated capillary angiogenesis, while lacking the muscle necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrate seen after acute ischemia. Surprisingly, the chronic ischemia group recovered dermal blood flow more slowly and less completely than did the acute ischemia group, as measured by laser Doppler (0.66 +/- 0.02 vs 0.76 +/- 0.04, P < .05) and tissue oxygen tension (0.61 +/- 0.06 vs 0.81 +/- 0.05, P < .05) at 40 days postoperatively. Consistent with poorer blood flow recovery, chronic ischemia resulted in smaller diameter collateral arteries (average diameter of the five largest collaterals on angiogram was 0.01 +/- 0.0003 mm vs 0.013 +/- 0.0007 mm for acute, P < .005 at 40 days postoperatively). Acute ischemia resulted in decreased tissue concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (0.96 +/- 0.23 pg/mg of muscle for acute vs 4.4 +/- 0.75 and 4.8 +/- 0.75 pg/mg of muscle for unoperated and chronic, respectively, P < .05 acute vs unoperated), and in increased tissue concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta (7.3 +/- 4.0 pg/mg of muscle for acute vs undetectable and 1.7 +/- 1.6 pg/mg of muscle for unoperated and chronic, respectively, P < 0.05 acute vs unoperated).\nWe describe here the first model of chronic hindlimb ischemia in the rat. Restoration of blood flow after induction of hindlimb ischemia is dependent on the rate of arterial occlusion. This difference in blood flow recovery correlates with distinct patterns of muscle necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cytokine induction in the ischemic muscle. Differences between models of acute and chronic hindlimb ischemia may have important consequences for future studies of mechanisms regulating arteriogenesis and for therapeutic approaches aimed at promoting arteriogenesis in humans suffering from critical limb ischemia.\nDespite the substantial clinical differences between acute and chronic ischemia, researchers attempting to develop molecular therapies to treat critical limb ischemia have only tested those therapies in experimental models of acute hindlimb ischemia. We present here a novel model of chronic hindlimb ischemia in the rat. We further demonstrate that when hindlimb ischemia is developed chronically, collateral artery development is poorer than when hindlimb ischemia is developed acutely. These findings suggest that further tests of molecular therapies for critical limb ischemia should be performed in chronic hindlimb ischemia models rather than in acute hindlimb ischemia models.",

    "abstract": "Clinical observation suggests that chronic venous insufficiency is related to failure of venous valves. Duplex ultrasound studies of lower extremity superficial veins regularly show valve failure and venous reflux. Gross morphologic observation of venous valves in surgical specimens shows tearing, splitting, scarring, and disappearance of valves.\nVenous valve damage is acquired, linked with venous hypertension, and affected by inflammation.\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the inflammatory process in valve remodeling associated with acute and chronic venous hypertension.\nA femoral arteriovenous fistula was created in study animals (Wistar rats, n = 60), and animals without an arteriovenous fistula were studied as controls (n = 5). At 1, 7, 21, and 42 days animals with the femoral arteriovenous fistula were anesthetized, and systemic pressure, the pressure in the femoral vein distal to fistula, and the pressure of the femoral vein in the contralateral hind limb were measured. Timed collection of blood backflow after division of the femoral vein distal to the fistula and in the alive, anesthetized animal was collected, measured, and calculated per unit time to be used as an indicator of valve insufficiency. The femoral vein distal to the fistula was harvested; valvular structures were examined and measured. Specimens were processed, and longitudinal sections were made and challenged with immunostaining antibodies against matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Sections were examined, and expression of molecular markers was determined by light absorption measurements after image digitization.\nOne week after the procedure, all animals exhibited some degree of hind limb edema ipsilateral to the arteriovenous fistula. Pressure in the femoral vein distal to the fistula was markedly increased on average to 96 +/- 9 mm Hg. Reflux was increased in a time-dependent manner, with the 21-day and 42-day groups showing the highest values. Valves just distal to the fistula showed an increased diameter of the valvular annulus and a shortening of the annular height. Venous wall findings included fibrosis and fusion of the media and adventitia and scarring and disappearance of valves principally in the 21- and 42-day specimens. Immunolabeling for MMP-2 showed an increased level in the 21- and 42-day groups. MMP-9 showed an increased level at 1 day, followed by a more marked level in the 21- and 42-day groups.\nIn this animal model of venous hypertension the findings of limb edema, increasing valvular reflux, and morphologic changes of increased annulus diameter and valve height are seen. Histologic changes included massive fibrosis of media and fusion with adventitia. Inflammatory markers MMP-2 and MMP-9 are strongly represented, and valve disappearance occurs after these markers are present. The gross morphologic changes seen are quite similar to those observed in human surgical specimens removed in treatment of venous insufficiency.\nWhen observed angioscopically at the time of vein stripping, saphenous vein valves show severe deformities including shortening, scarring, and tearing. The current model of induced venous hypertension demonstrates early venous valve changes that replicate those observed in humans. This observation provides a link from venous hypertension to an induced inflammatory reaction that stimulates the valve damage. Thus the model could be useful for defining the fundamental mechanisms that cause venous valve failure and varicose veins and in pharmacologic testing to prevent or treat venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Measuring venous refilling time by photoplethysmography is one of the most commonly used methods in venous diagnostics. Numerous studies have been done in adults to investigate its suitability to assess the overall venous calf pump function and to discriminate healthy subjects from patients with venous disease. The present study investigated any changes in the behavior of venous calf pump function from childhood to adulthood in subjects with healthy veins.\nThe study population consisted of 73 healthy (CEAP clinical classes C0 and C1) subjects (52 females, 21 males) who were all of the same age group (10 to 12 years old). It was a representative selection of the participants in a comprehensive longitudinal vein study known as the Bochum study (BO). The data of this study were obtained from (original) pupils of 11 secondary schools in the city of Bochum, Germany at four different periods (BO I 1982-1983, 10 to 12 years; BO II 1986-1987, 14 to 16 years; BO III 1991, 18 to 20 years; and BO IV 2001-2002, 29 to 31 years), 1990 RESULTS: The distribution patterns of venous refilling time showed a successive shift to the right from childhood to adulthood. The distribution peak was in the range of 10.1 to 20 seconds in BO I, broadened to 10.1 to 30 seconds in BO II, and changed to 40.1 to 50 seconds in BO III and BO IV. The median values increased from 24 seconds to more than 45 seconds. When we compared the two subgroups classified as C0 and C1, there was no significant difference in the behavior of their venous refilling time.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time the physiologic changes of venous calf pump function have been documented in a longitudinal study in young volunteers with healthy veins. The median venous refilling time successively lengthened, corresponding to a maturing of the venous calf pump function during adolescence and then stayed on a stable level. Therefore, measurements of venous calf pump function are not a means for assessing malfunction of the venous system during childhood and adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) often ask whether elective vein surgery could be delayed without consequences. Because the natural history of CVD is not well known, this study was designed to determine its progression in such patients.\nOne hundred and sixteen limbs in 90 patients who had at least 2 exams with duplex ultrasound (DU) scanning prior to vein surgery at a university medical center were studied. These were patients who were offered an operation but for various reasons were treated at a later stage. Patients were classified by the CEAP system.\nThe mean age of the patients was 49 years (range, 23 to 81 years). A second DU scan was performed 1 to 43 months after the initial exam (median, 19 months). Eighty-five limbs (73.3%) were unchanged. Thirteen limbs (11.2%) had progression of clinical stage, and seven had progression on DU scanning as well. Seven limbs progressed from C2 to C3, four limbs from C3 to C4, and two limbs from C4 to C6. Thirty-four limbs had a documented change on repeat DU scanning. In 3 of these limbs, reflux was missed on the initial exam; therefore, 31 limbs had progression of disease. The great saphenous vein and tributaries were the most often anatomic sites affected by a change, followed by perforators. Seventeen limbs (14.7%) had extension of pre-existing reflux, and 14 (12.1%) had reflux in a new segment. In 11 of these limbs, a change in the initial plan for treatment was required. Symptomatic or DU changes were noted 6 months or later in 95% of limbs and 74.2% of limbs with disease progression were diagnosed at 12 months or later. All but one of the 13 symptomatic limbs developed symptoms at least a year later.\nNearly one third of patients with venous reflux had progression. Anatomic extension is frequent with disease progression but not a pre-requisite. Progression was found in most limbs 6 months after the initial study.

There were two failures (9%).\nUnilateral arm swelling without thrombosis, when not caused by lymphatic obstruction, may be due to subclavian vein compression at the costoclavicular ligament because of compression either by that ligament or the subclavius tendon most often because of congenital close proximity of the vein to the ligament. Arm symptoms of neurogenic TOS, pain, and paresthesia often accompany venous TOS while neck pain and headache, other common symptoms of neurogenic TOS, are infrequent. Diagnosis was made by dynamic venography.

    "abstract": "Construction of prosthetic arteriovenous access for hemodialysis in the thigh results in a high incidence of graft failure and infection. Autogenous femoral artery-common femoral thigh transposition (transposed femoral vein [tFV]) arteriovenous accesses have superior patency, but our previous report documented a high incidence of ischemic events requiring secondary surgical intervention. Recent results of improved patient selection and intraoperative maneuvers to reduce ischemia are unknown.\nDuring a 6-year period eight children (mean age, 13.3 years) and 46 adults (mean age, 52.3 years; 27 female, 19 male) underwent construction of 55 tFV thigh accesses for hemodialysis access. Adult patients were divided into groups I and II on the basis of the introduction of specific strategies to reduce the incidence of ischemic complications. In the cohort of children, steal prophylaxis included one banded femoral vein, three tapered femoral veins, two distal femoral artery pressure measurements taken before and after access construction (mean ratio, 0.70), and two closed anterior and superficial posterior compartment fasciotomies. Of the first 25 accesses in adults (group I, mean age, 55.9 years), 10 had access banding (six at the initial procedure and four in the immediate postoperative period to treat ischemia). Of the second 22 accesses (group II, mean age, 48.2 years), steal prophylaxis included 14 tapered femoral veins, 6 distal femoral artery pressure measurements (mean ratio, 0.76; range, 0.62 to 0.86), and 1 fasciotomy. Patients with significant distal occlusive disease were not offered a tFV access in the time frame of group II.\nEight accesses in children had 100% primary functional patency at 2 years, with no reoperations for ischemia. Nine group I adult patients underwent remedial procedures to correct distal ischemia. No adult patient in group II required a remedial procedure to correct ischemia. Groups I and II 2-year secondary functional access patency was 87% and 94%, respectively. There were no access infections in either group. Femoral vein tapering significantly reduced the need for remedial correction of ischemia ( P = .03).\nImproved patient selection and selective intraoperative femoral vein tapering eliminated remedial procedures to correct ischemia in patients undergoing tFV access. Patency rates were excellent despite the liberal use of vein tapering. Transposed FV access should be considered for good risk individuals undergoing their first lower extremity access.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to examine factors predictive of success or failure after percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) and stenting (S) of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and to compare the results of PTA/S with a contemporary group of patients treated with femoropopliteal bypass.\nA database of patients undergoing PTA and/or S of the SFA between 1986 and 2004 was maintained. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Patients underwent duplex scanning follow-up at 1, 3, and every 6 months after the intervention. Angiograms were reviewed in all cases to assess lesion characteristics and preprocedure and postprocedure runoff. Results were standardized to current TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) and Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to assess factors associated with patient survival and treatment efficacy.\nThree hundred eighty total limbs underwent PTA/S in 329 patients (67% male, 33% female; average age, 65 years). Mean follow-up was 1.8 years from the date of initial intervention. Indications for intervention were claudication in 66%, rest pain in 16%, and tissue loss in 18%. Runoff at the tibial level was 2.1 +/- 0.8 patent vessels. Mean SVS ischemia grade was 3.1 (range, 1 to 5). TASC lesion grades were A (48%), B (18%), C (22%), and D (12%). Angioplasty alone was used in 63% of cases. Primary treatment failure (inability to cross lesion) was seen in 7% of patients. There was one periprocedural death. Primary patency rates were 86% at 3 months, 80% at 6 months, 75% at 12 months, 66% at 24 months, 60% at 36 months, 58% at 48 months, and 52% at 60 months. Assisted primary patency rates were slightly higher ( P = not significant). By Cox proportional hazards analysis, patency of PTA/S was associated with higher preoperative ankle/brachial index ( P = .016) and the performance of angioplasty only ( P = .011). Failed or occluded PTA/S was associated with TASC C ( P < .0001) and TASC D lesions ( P < .0001). Patient death was associated with the presence of congestive heart failure ( P = .003). Subgroup analysis revealed that primary patency rates are highly dependent on lesion type (A > B > C > D, P < .0001). PTA/S patency for TASC A and B lesions compared favorably to prosthetic and venous femoropopliteal bypass. Surgical bypass was superior to PTA/S for TASC C and D lesions.\nPTA and stenting of the SFA can be performed safely with excellent procedural success rates. Improved patency of these interventions was seen with increased ankle/brachial index and the performance of angioplasty only. Worse patency was seen with TASC C and TASC D lesions. Patency rates were strongly dependent on lesion type, and the results of angioplasty and stenting compared favorably with surgical bypass for TASC A and B lesions.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the ability of generic and disease-specific questionnaires to assess quality of life (QOL) at baseline and to detect change in QOL after treatment in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nThis prospective multicenter trial recruited 514 patients with PAD who needed an imaging workup and had an ankle brachial pressure index of less than 0.90. Patients with severe comorbidity were excluded, leaving a study population of 450 patients. Patients completed two generic questionnaires, the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the European Quality of Life 5D (EuroQol-5D), and one disease-specific questionnaire, the Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQol) at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up. Rutherford classification and treadmill walking distance were determined at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up and were considered indicators of disease severity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUCs) were used to evaluate each of the three questionnaires for its ability to discriminate between severe and mild disease at baseline and to discriminate between a large and small change in disease severity after follow-up. The underlying assumption was that disease severity is a major determinant of QOL. This implies that the validity of a QOL questionnaire is reflected by its ability to discriminate between mildly and severely diseased patients.\nAt baseline, 443 patients and after follow-up, 386 patients completed questionnaires. At baseline, no significant ( P >.05) differences were observed among AUCs for the total scores of the three questionnaires, indicating that all three questionnaires assessed the disease severity equally well. After follow-up, the AUCs for the VascuQol were significantly higher than the AUCs for the SF-36 and EuroQol-5D with respect to detection of improvement in Rutherford classification ( P < .05), indicating that change in disease severity after follow-up was best detected by the VascuQol.\nThe VascuQol is the preferred questionnaire as outcome measure for QOL in future trials and clinical follow-up of patients with PAD.",

Over the last years, several novel mediators relevant to the process of atherogenesis have been identified, but few and conflicting data are available on the possible association with PAD symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine an extended thrombophilic risk profile of patients with symptomatic PAD.\nTwo hundred eighty patients with symptomatic PAD admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Florence were compared with 280 control subjects without PAD, matched for age and gender. The following metabolic and genetic risk factors were evaluated: lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, antiphospholipid antibodies, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin variant, and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism.\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, showed a significant association between PAD symptoms and prothrombin variant, altered levels of homocysteine, lipoprotein(a), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Moreover, the presence of high levels of lipoprotein(a) and another metabolic risk factor raised the likelihood of PAD symptoms (dyslipidemia and elevated lipoprotein[a]: odds ratio [OR], 29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2 to 136.2; P <.0001; hyperhomocysteinemia and elevated lipoprotein[a]: OR, 37.7; 95% CI, 3.7 to 381.5; P <.0001). A significant correlation between the number of altered thrombophilic parameters and the Fontaine stage was observed ( R = 0.16; P = .006).\nThere is an independent association between altered levels of important thrombophilic risk factors and PAD symptoms. The clinical significance of this association needs to be tested in prospective population-based trials.",

    "abstract": "Penetrating injuries to the axillary and subclavian vessels are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Although the endovascular repair of such injuries has been increasingly described, an algorithm for endovascular versus conventional surgical repair has yet to be clearly defined. On the basis of institutional endovascular experience treating vascular injuries in other anatomic locations, we defined an algorithm for the management of axillosubclavian vascular injuries. Subsequently, a near decade long experience with the management of axillosubclavian vascular injuries was retrospectively analyzed, so as to more accurately assess the true feasibility of endovascular treatment in these patients.\nWe defined a management algorithm that included (1) indications, (2) relative contraindications, and (3) strict contraindications for the endovascular repair of axillosubclavian vascular injuries. Anatomic indications for endovascular repair were restricted to relatively limited axillosubclavian injuries (pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas, first-order branch vessel injuries, intimal flaps, and focal lacerations). Relative contraindications for endovascular repair included injury to the axillary artery's third portion, substantial venous injury (eg, transection), refractory hypotension, and upper extremity compartment syndrome with neurovascular compression. Strict contraindications to endovascular repair included long segmental injuries, injuries without sufficient proximal or distal vascular fixation points, and subtotal/total arterial transection. Within the context of these definitions, we retrospectively reviewed 46 noniatrogenic subclavian and axillary vascular injuries in 45 patients identified by a prospectively maintained computer registry during a 9-year period. Presentations were reviewed concurrently by two endovascular surgeons, and potential candidates for endovascular management were defined.\nAmong 46 total case presentations and among the 40 patients who maintained vital signs on presentation, 17 were potentially treatable with endovascular therapy. Among the cohort of 40 presentations, the most common contraindications to endovascular therapy were hemodynamic instability (n = 10), vessel transection (n = 7), and no proximal vascular fixation site (n = 3).\nDespite growing enthusiasm for endovascular repair of injuries to the axillary and subclavian vessels, realistic clinical presentation and anatomic locations restrict the broad application of this technique at present. In our experience, less than but approaching 50% of all injuries encountered could be addressed with an endovascular approach. This percentage will increase during the upcoming decades if the endovascular technologies available in hybrid endovascular operating rooms uniformly improve.",

    "abstract": "Carotid arteriography (CA) is an important method of assessing carotid artery occlusive disease and is the best method of planning for carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS). This study compared the results of CA performed by vascular surgeons in a contemporary series against widely recognized interdisciplinary quality standards for this procedure. Although many vascular surgeons perform CA, there is a paucity of data about its safety, efficacy, and compliance with quality standards in vascular practice. The importance of quality CA will likely increase as CAS emerges to assume a broader clinical role.\nCarotid arteriograms performed by seven vascular surgeons at three institutions from September 2000 to May 2004 were reviewed. These results were compared with quality standards for the performance of CA.\nFive hundred three carotid arteriograms were performed over 45 months. Indications for the procedure were extracranial cerebrovascular disease (86%), trauma (5%), and other conditions (9%). Indications for the procedure were appropriate in 100% of patients (as determined by guidelines document) and exceeded the recommended standard of appropriate indications in 99%. All procedures successfully provided the information required, exceeding the threshold of 98% for procedural success. Reversible neurologic deficits occurred in 0.6% (two transient ischemic attacks and one stroke) compared with the threshold of 2.5%.

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is proven to be the most effective treatment for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 50% or greater and asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 60% or greater. Although the prevalence of carotid artery disease increases with age, most prospective and randomized trials have excluded patients older than 80 years, implying that they are either at higher procedural risk or have decreased life expectancy. Since advanced age (>/=80 years) has been viewed as a \"high-risk\" indicator for CEA, age >/=80 years has been used as an indication for alternative treatment. The study was conducted to determine if age >/=80 years is related to increased morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in patients undergoing CEA.\nIn the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, 2217 CEAs were performed in 1961 patients. Three hundred sixty procedures were performed in 334 patients >/=80 years. Demographics, presentation, risk factors, operative outcome, and survival were analyzed. Contemporary literature was reviewed and the results summarized.\nIn patients aged >/=80 years, compared with their younger cohort, there was no difference in stroke (1.1% vs 0.8%, P = .333) but there was a higher operative mortality (1.9% vs 0.8%, P = .053). The combined stroke/death rate was higher in octogenarians (3.1% vs 1.5%, P = .041). This difference was due to the greater stroke/death rate in symptomatic octogenarians vs asymptomatic octogenarians (6.0% vs 0.9%, P = .007). The average postoperative length of stay was 3.2 +/- 4.8 days for octogenarians compared with 2.4 +/- 3.5 days for their younger counterparts ( P < .001). Thirty-seven percent of the octogenarians were discharged on the first postoperative day vs 51% ( P < .001), whereas 13% remained hospitalized beyond 5 days vs 8% ( P = .003). Although Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a higher mortality in octogenarians, survival after CEA approaches that of the overall population. A summary of the contemporary literature of CEA in 2204 patients >/=80 shows an operative stroke rate of 2.23% and death rate of 1.28%, with a combined stroke/death rate of 3.51%.\nCEA is a safe and effective procedure in the octogenarian. The combined stroke/death rate is increased in patients aged >/=80, indicating increased risk, predominantly in symptomatic patients. Although CEA risk in octogenarians is higher compared with a younger cohort, outcomes remain within acceptable national guidelines and within outcome measures known to confer benefit compared with best medical care. Therefore, the term \"high risk\" should not be arbitrarily applied to patients reaching the 80-year threshold. This is confirmed by the contemporary literature.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of adverse events after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for women compared with men is controversial. This report compares the incidence of perioperative stroke and death in men and women by examining the effect of comorbidities and hospital setting on CEA outcomes.\nAll CEAs performed in non-Federal acute-care Virginia hospitals between 1997 and 2001 were reviewed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics were compared for possible relationships to perioperative adverse events.\nA total of 14,095 CEAs were performed in 34 urban and 28 rural hospitals (9 high-volume and 53 low-volume hospitals); 42% were performed on women, and 58% were performed on men. Women experienced a significantly higher stroke rate (1.23%) than men (0.87%; P = .04) with bivariate analysis. However, logistic regression analysis of comorbidities and hospital settings demonstrated that sex was actually not independently related to adverse outcomes in CEA ( P = .08). Preoperative neurologic symptoms could not be evaluated as risk factors for adverse events. Acute coronary ischemia, history of arrhythmia, end-stage renal disease, nonwhite race, advanced age, and low hospital volume were all significantly related to mortality. History of arrhythmia was the only factor that was significantly related to the incidence of stroke.\nLogistic regression analysis of comorbidities and hospital setting indicated that female sex is not independently associated with higher mortality or a higher stroke rate during CEA. These data indicate that patients with carotid stenosis frequently have multiple medical problems that need to be carefully examined and controlled before any single patient or hospital factor is designated as significantly related to adverse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The feasibility of carotid stenting (CS) is no longer questionable, although its indications remain debatable. Until the results of randomized trials are available, personal series and registries should help in the comparison of long-term results of CS with those of endarterectomy. We report here the long-term results of a large series of CS in our department with a long follow-up. This retrospective study reviews a single surgeon's 11-year experience with CS. Our results are compared with those of conventional surgery emanating from our own series and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), and Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS).\nCS has been performed in our department in a single, semi-private institution for 12 years. Patients with high lesions, and postradiotherapy and postendarterectomy stenoses were treated with CS, as were patients at high risk for surgery. The others were operated on with conventional endarterectomy. During the study, we performed 221 CS procedures on 193 patients (150 men and 43 women). The average follow-up was 2.7 years (1 month to 9.3 years). We analyzed the late results in terms of prevention from stroke, the freedom from new neurologic events, and also patency rates of the treated carotid vessels. We also identified predictors for neurologic complication and in-stent restenosis by using univariate analysis.\nLife-table analyses at 10 years gave a 96% (confidence interval [CI] = 3%) rate for stroke freedom, a 98% (CI = 2%) rate for fatal stroke freedom, and a primary assisted patency rate of 95% (CI = 3%). Predictors for neurologic complication were [corrected] age >70 ( P = .041), and [corrected] potential renal insufficiency ( P = .056 [corrected] In-stent restenosis occurrence extended from 2 months to 4.5 years after the procedure. The restenosis rates at 6 months, 1, 2, and 4.5 years were, respectively, 1.4%, 2.3%, 3.7%, and 5.9% (13/221). No factors were found to be strong predictors of in-stent restenosis [corrected]\nThese long-term results show that CS is competitive with conventional surgery. A more accurate selection for CS or surgery might reduce the rate of complications after carotid stenosis repair.",

We analyzed the data of consecutive 17 patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections who underwent endovascular repairs with the Inoue single-branched stent graft between July 1999 and April 2004. Complete baseline and follow-up data were available on all patients. The mean age was 71 +/- 9 years, and 13 of the patients (76%) were men. Eight patients (47%) were considered unfit for open surgery because of advanced age or the presence of comorbid diseases.\nThe stent grafts were successfully delivered and deployed in all 17 patients. Periprocedural major complications, defined as those that caused any persistent disorder, occurred in one patient who developed spinal ischemia. A postoperative computed tomographic scan revealed three attachment site endoleaks; two endoleaks were from the proximal attachment sites and one endoleak was from the distal attachment site. The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 7 to 65 months). Two deaths occurred in the follow-up period from cerebral bleeding and pneumonia, both considered unrelated to the stent grafting. Two patients with attachment site endoleaks needed secondary stent-grafting; one patient required the implantation of a straight stent-graft in the distal attachment site and the other, the implantation of a double-branched stent-graft. Another patient with attachment site endoleak was considered very high-risk for open surgery or secondary stent grafting and did not undergo secondary intervention. The aneurysmal sac size of the patient has been stable for 28 months. The branched section of the stent graft was patent in all patients in the follow-up period.\nThe results demonstrate the feasibility of the Inoue single-branched stent graft for thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections involving the left subclavian artery.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative imaging modalities for endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) include conventional computed tomography (CT), aortography with a marking catheter, and three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT). Although each technique has advantages, to date no study has compared in a prospective manner the reproducibility of measurements and impact on graft selection of all three modalities. The objective of this study was to determine the most useful imaging studies in planning EVAR.\nTwenty patients being considered for EVAR were enrolled prospectively to undergo a conventional CT scan and aortography. The CT scans were then reconstructed into 3D images using Preview Treatment Planning Software (Medical Media Systems, West Lebanon, NH). Four measurements of diameter and six of length were made from each modality in determining the proper graft for EVAR.\nMeasurements from all three modalities were reproducible with intraobserver correlation coefficients of 0.79 to 1.0 for aortography, 0.87 to 1.0 for CT, and 0.96 to 1.0 for 3D CT. Measurements between observers were also similar from each modality; interobserver correlations were 0.70 to 0.97 for aortography, 0.76 to 0.97 for CT, and 0.73 to 0.99 for 3D CT. Significant differences ( P < .01) in diameter measurements were noted at D2 with aortography compared with 3D CT, whereas differences in length measurements were found between CT and 3D CT at L4 (nonaneurysmal right iliac) ( P < .01). The correlation between CT and 3D CT for most length measurements was acceptable (0.63 to 1.0). Aortography for diameters correlated poorly (0.35 to 0.67) with 3D CT. When the endograft selected by aortography/CT or 3D CT alone was compared with the actual endograft used, there was agreement in 11 of 11 patients when adjusted for +/- one size in diameter or length.\nReproducible and comparable measures of diameter and length can be obtained by each of three imaging modalities available for endograft sizing. As a single imaging modality, 3D CT appears to have the best correlation for both diameters and lengths; however, the difference is not sufficient enough to alter endograft selection. Three-dimensional CT may be reserved for challenging aortic anatomy where small differences in measurements would affect patient or graft selection for EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Pararenal and type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) are not currently considered as indications for endovascular repair given unfavorable neck anatomy or aneurysm involvement of the visceral vessels. Open repair of these aneurysms is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly postoperative renal dysfunction. In selective high-risk patients, debranching of the visceral aorta to improve the proximal neck region can be used to facilitate endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm.\nBetween October 2000 and July 2003, 10 patients were treated with open visceral revascularization and endovascular repair of pararenal and type IV TAAAs at a single institution. Patient demographics and procedural characteristics were obtained from medical records.\nOverall 13 visceral bypasses were performed in 10 patients: 6 patients with a single iliorenal bypass, 3 with a hepatorenal bypass, and 1 patient with complete visceral revascularization. Juxtarenal aneurysms occurred in 5 patients (50%), suprarenal aneurysms in 3 patients (30%), and type IV TAAAs in 2 patients (20%). All patients had successful endovascular aneurysm exclusion. Mean follow-up was 8.7 months. There were no perioperative deaths, neurologic deficits coagulopathies, or renal dysfunction. Follow-up spiral computed tomography scans demonstrated patency of all bypass grafts with only one patient requiring a secondary intervention for late type I leak which was sealed with placement of a proximal cuff.\nThese initial results suggest that are similar to infrarenal AAA endovascular repair. This combined approach to repair of pararenal and type IV TAAAs reduces the morbidity and mortality of open repair, and represents an attractive option in high-risk patients while endoluminal technology continues to evolve.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair uses the visceral aortic segment, in the setting of a suboptimal proximal neck, for sealing and fixation. This technique requires the placement of visceral stents and might be hampered by the deleterious effects of such interventions. This study was performed to define outcomes related to renal events.\nConsecutive clinical records and radiographic studies of patients treated primarily with an endovascular approach with a fenestrated endograft were reviewed. The population was divided into groups with and without baseline renal dysfunction based on the National Kidney Foundation definition of chronic kidney disease. Morphologic measurements and the detection of postoperative renal events such as renal artery stenosis or occlusion, need for dialysis, deterioration of renal function by using estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and secondary interventions related to the renal arteries were assessed. Preoperative and postprocedural factors predictive for the development of renal dysfunction were assessed by using a Fisher exact test, t test, and logistic regression.\nA total of 72 patients were treated between 2001 and 2004 with a mean age, aneurysm size, and follow-up of 75 years, 6.2 cm, and 6 months (range, 1 to 24 months), respectively. No ruptures and five deaths (two procedure-related) were observed. There were 23 patients with baseline renal insufficiency and 49 patients without insufficiency. Twenty-four patients had deterioration in GFR >30% during the follow-up period, and 17 patients experienced 19 renal-related events (more common in patients with baseline insufficiency, 39% vs 16.3%; P = .04; relative risk, 2.4). Four patients required dialysis (two permanent), and all had preoperative renal dysfunction ( P = .002); similarly, death was also more common in this group (17.4% vs 2%; P = .02; relative risk, 8.52). Renal events in most patients occurred within the first postoperative month (59%). However, mean GFR stabilized after 6 months.\nAneurysm repair with fenestrated endovascular grafts is associated with a significant risk for adverse renal events (16% in those without renal dysfunction, although none developed a creatinine >2 mg/dL, and 39% for patients with preoperative renal dysfunction). These patients must be meticulously followed, particularly within the first month after such a procedure. When renal artery restenosis is suspected or diagnosed, aggressive approach might be warranted to limit the extent of late renal dysfunction.",

A recent arteriogram revealed innominate and left common carotid artery stenosis as well as recurrent coarctation. He had previously undergone three Dacron patch aortoplasties. At the age of 7, he underwent a fourth operation for recurrent coarctation and because of extensive scar tissue in the region of his prior procedures, a left subclavian artery-to-descending aortic bypass was performed. An endovascular repair to deal with the recent recurrence was performed because of prior surgical difficulties. Percutaneous balloon-expandable stents were placed in the aortic coarctation, innominate, and the left common carotid arteries.

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1 ) is known to maintain a balance between apoptosis and cellular dysfunction and therefore may have a pivotal role in vessel remodeling during pathogenesis of vascular disorders. We previously demonstrated that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mediates signal transduction in vascular wall during the development of varicose veins. Currently, we investigated the expression and correlation of TGF-beta 1 , iNOS, monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), in a series of normal and varicose vein specimens.\nTwenty varicose vein specimens were retrieved from 20 patients undergoing lower-extremity varicose vein excision, and 27 normal greater saphenous vein segments (controls) were obtained from 27 patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery. Principal risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco abuse) were also compared. Varicose vein segments were separated into tortuous and nontortuous regions based on their macroscopic and microscopic morphology. VSMC actin, CD68 + monocytes/macrophages, iNOS, and TGF-beta 1 , were examined by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.\nAccording to the CEAP classification for chronic lower extremity venous disease, most of the patients were in class 2 for clinical signs of the disease (n = 11). Mean ages were 53.6 +/- 4.7 years for the varicose vein group and 56.5 +/- 4.4 years for the controls. The gender distribution was same in both groups. Immunoreactivity to TGF-beta 1 and iNOS was significantly different in the tortuous regions of the varicose veins compared with nontortuous regions (P < .01). Not only was a significantly higher expression of iNOS noted in the varicose vein group (P < .001), but a differential expression of iNOS was also observed in the tortuous and nontortuous portions of the varicose veins. Significant overexpression of TGF-beta 1 (P < .01) that correlated with overproduction of iNOS and with increased presence of CD68 + monocytes/macrophages was observed in the varicose vein walls compared with normal veins.\nThis is the first evidence of TGF-beta 1 , as well as iNOS, being differentially upregulated in nontortuous and tortuous segments of varicose veins. The increased expression of TGF-beta 1 and presence of macrophages, correlating with overproduction of iNOS, may be associated with varicosity development and deserves further study.\nThe pathogenesis of varicose veins, the most common manifestation of chronic venous disease, is debatable. Elucidation of mechanisms involved in the disease process is the first step to improved therapeutic modulations. Towards this goal, the relationship between NO production and TGF-beta 1 in the molecular pathophysiology of chronic venous disease was investigated. The data identify for the first time, an important role for TGF-b1-iNOS-monocyte/macrophage signaling in the etiology of varicosities. Furthermore, we determine if there are any significant differences within the varicose vein group itself based on regional differences, by classifying the varicose tissues into tortuous and non-tortuous segments.",

    "abstract": "Increased levels of homocysteine in the blood are a risk factor for atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of homocysteine on smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and to determine whether p38 was involved in this process.\nThe effect of 0.5 to 2.0 mmol/L d , l -homocysteine as a chemoattractant for SMCs was assayed with a modified Boyden chamber. To determine the functional role of p38 in SMC chemotaxis induced by d , l -homocysteine, we treated SMCs with a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, before the assay.\nThe number of migrated cells was increased 7.0 +/- 1.2-fold (n = 15; P < .001) by 2.0 mmol/L d , l -homocysteine. SB203580 partially prevented the migration of SMCs toward homocysteine. Preconditioning SMCs with 2.0 mmol/L d , l -homocysteine significantly enhanced chemotaxis toward 10% fetal bovine serum compared with nonconditioned control SMCs (28.9 +/- 3.3-fold vs 15.6 +/- 2.8-fold; P < .05). There was a fourfold p38 activation after exposure of SMCs to 2.0 mmol/L d , l -homocysteine by immunoblot.\nThese results suggest that homocysteine not only is a chemoattractant for SMC but can also enhance SMC chemotactic potential. The mechanism of these effects may involve p38 activation.\nThis study demonstrates that homocysteine can promote chemotaxis of SMCs through a p38-dependent pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report that homocysteine may influence SMC chemotaxis. It may be an important mechanism for homocysteine-induced atherogenesis, because the migration of SMCs from the media is believed to play a critical role in progressive intimal thickening. Although homocysteine promotes atherogenesis and thrombosis by a variety of mechanisms, the effects of homocysteine on SMC proliferation and migration might be critical elements that may have potential therapeutic implications, because selective blockade of the p38 pathway is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are fundamental in diverse cardiovascular processes such as arteriogenesis, atherosclerosis, and restenosis. We aimed to determine the intracellular signaling mechanisms by which ECs promote a differentiated SMC phenotype.\nBovine thoracic aorta ECs and SMCs were isolated and cultured. For co-culture studies, ECs were grown to confluence on one side of a semi-permeable Cyclopore membrane. SMCs were then plated on the opposite side of the membrane and cultured for 24 to 48 hours. For adenovirus experiments, SMCs were infected prior to plating opposite ECs. For conditioned media studies, SMCs cultured alone on plastic were treated with media harvested from EC/SMC in co-culture. SMC phenotype was assayed by microscopy and measurement of two-dimensional area, or by western blotting for contractile protein markers of differentiation. Akt activation was measured by western blotting for phospho-Serine 473.\nAlthough SMCs cultured alone exhibit a dedifferentiated synthetic phenotype, we report that bilayer co-culture with ECs induced a differentiated SMC phenotype as measured by morphology and cell area and expression of protein markers of differentiation, including contractile proteins and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip . The EC/SMC bilayer co-culture resulted in activation of the SMC protein kinase Akt, with no effect on total Akt expression. Similarly, conditioned media from co-cultured EC/SMC promoted rapid Akt phosphorylation and subsequent expression of differentiation protein markers in SMCs cultured alone. Adenoviral overexpression of constitutively active Akt in SMCs cultured alone mimicked the ability of ECs to induce SMC differentiation. Notably, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase activity with wortmannin or adenoviral overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt prevented the EC-mediated effect on SMC morphology and differentiation protein marker expression.\nECs direct SMCs towards a differentiated phenotype through activation of the SMC PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway.\nInteractions between endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are fundamental in diverse cardiovascular processes such as arteriogenesis, collateral blood vessel development, atherosclerosis, and restenosis. Alterations in SMC phenotype occur in each of these processes. Endothelial denudation has been suggested to contribute to the SMC proliferative response to vessel injury by angioplasty or other catheterization procedures. We have employed a co-culture approach to dissect the molecular signals that are dependent on the spatial relationship between ECs and SMCs, and have identified the importance of the PI3K/Akt pathway in EC-induced SMC differentiation. This pathway may suggest targets for therapeutic interventions for intimal hyperplasia and restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous vein grafts are commonly used for arterial reconstructive procedures. Their success is limited by the development of intimal hyperplasia (IH), a fibroproliferative disease that predisposes the grafts to occlusive stenosis. Mesenchymal cell proliferation and the deposition of an extracellular matrix characterize neointimal development. Increasing evidence suggests that, regardless of blood vessel type, IH results from complex interactions among vessel wall cells, infiltrating leukocytes, and cytokines. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a pleiotropic cytokine with powerful effects on inflammatory cell chemotaxis; smooth muscle cell, fibroblast, and endothelial cell proliferation; and extracellular matrix synthesis.\nEpigastric vein to common femoral artery interposition grafts were placed in male Lewis rats and harvested at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery. We used replication-defective adenoviruses to deliver a control reporter gene for the enzyme beta-galactosidase (Ad-GAL), empty virus (Ad-CMVpLpA), or the sequence encoding the antisense strand of TGF-beta1 (Ad-AST). The vein graft was transduced passively in medium containing 10 7 plaque-forming units per milliliter of Ad-GAL, Ad-CMVpLpA, or Ad-AST for 20 minutes at room temperature. The adenovirus-treated grafts were compared with grafts treated with medium without virus (sham).\nThe Ad-GAL control grafts showed beta-galactosidase activity from 3 days to 4 weeks. Twenty percent of cells were positive out to 2 weeks, at which time the number of cells positive for beta-galactosidase activity began to decline. Treatment with Ad-AST resulted in a significant reduction vs sham, Ad-CMVpLpA, and Ad-GAL in TGF-beta1 messenger RNA, total TGF-beta1 protein, and bioactive TGF-beta1 protein. Neointimal area was significantly reduced in the Ad-AST group vs Ad-GAL at 4 weeks, vs Ad-CMVpLpA at 4 and 12 weeks, and vs sham at 2 and 4 weeks. The medial/adventitial layer was significantly thicker in the Ad-AST group than the Ad-GAL group at 12 weeks. In addition, we studied the effect of Ad-AST on monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). Although the reduction in TGF-beta1 resulted in a reduction of MCP-1 messenger RNA in whole-graft homogenates and MCP-1 protein-positive staining in histologic sections from the perianastomotic region, no reduction in the number of ED1-positive cells (monocytes and macrophages) was observed.\nPerioperative antisense TGF-beta1 treatment of the vein to be used in arterial reconstructions resulted in a prolonged diminution of IH; this emphasizes the importance of TGF-beta1 in neointimal thickening and indicates that ex vivo gene therapy can reduce the vessel's predisposition to IH.\nThe main cause of occlusion and graft failure after peripheral and cardiac arterial reconstruction is IH. The study of the mechanisms and mediators of IH, including TGF-beta1, should lead to future gene therapies to prevent or limit IH. The clinical effect of such treatments would be enormous, because they would increase graft longevity, thereby enhancing quality of life and enabling patients to live without the threat of limb loss or recurrent heart attack.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficacy of bovine peritoneum/fascia as an arterial substitute.\nTwelve dogs underwent bilateral femoral artery patch angioplasty with a glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine peritoneal/fascial patch (PFA patch) on one side and polyester patch on the contralateral side. Arteriograms were performed just before vessel harvest at 1 and 6 months, and vessels were evaluated for aneurysms and inflammation. Histologic analysis included intima area, media thickness, and lumen area. Immunofluorescence for CD 34 and Factor VIII was done to evaluate endothelialization and alpha-actin for smooth muscle cell growth. Mechanical strength testing was evaluated in separate PFA patches and compared independently to a commercially available bovine pericardial patch and polyester patch.\nAll vessels examined at both 1 and 6 months were patent with no arteriographic evidence of stenosis. There was no evidence of aneurysm formation in any vessel and no difference between groups in inflammatory reaction. One polyester patch at 1 month developed an infection. Microscopic evaluation of experimental vessels revealed no difference between groups in intima area at 1 month (2.1 +/- 1.2 vs 2.2 +/- 1.2 mm 2 ; P = .5) and at 6 months (1.81 +/- 1.2 vs 1.9 +/- 1.2 mm 2 ; P = .5). There was no difference in media thickness, but the PFA patch group had a greater lumen area at 1 month (8.8 +/- 2.9 vs 9.8 +/- 3.0 mm 2 ; P = .02) and 6 months (10.5 +/- 4.2 vs 11.7 +/- 5.6 mm 2 ; P = .02). Immunofluorescence for CD34 and Factor VIII demonstrated complete re-endothelialization of all patches. The polyester patch had a chronic inflammatory response, but not the PFA patch. Mechanical strength testing demonstrated that compared to pericardium, the PFA patch had superior ( P < .05) failure tension, stiffness, and suture pull-out strength, whereas extensibility, fatigue tension, relax slope, and creep tests were not different. Polyester demonstrated superior suture pull-out, stiffness, relax slope, and failure strain ( P < .05), but it was not different in failure tension and extensibility than the PFA patch. However, the PFA patch had significantly less creep (0.25 +/- 0.25 vs 4.92 +/- 0.84; P < .01).\nThe PFA patch has similar clot-resistant properties to polyester and is superior to the pericardial patch in mechanical strength. It is a promising endothelial alternative for not only arterial patches but other vascular products.\nThe search for an artificial, thromboresistant, and intimal hyperplasia resistant interface between blood and native blood vessels still continues. This study demonstrates the feasibility and proof of concept of the peritoneum's clot-resistant properties. When adding the underlying fascia, it serves as an ideal arterial patch. Other studies are underway evaluating its feasibility as a bypass graft and a \"drug coated\"-like stent lining.",

    "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are prominent mediators of the connective tissue destruction that characterizes abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is a cytokine-responsive transcription factor that promotes macrophage MMP expression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether aneurysmal degeneration is influenced by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a pharmacologic inhibitor of NF-kappaB.\nAdult male C57BL/6 mice underwent transient elastase perfusion of the abdominal aorta to induce the development of AAAs. Animals were treated every 48 hours by intraperitoneal injection with either saline (n = 34) or PDTC 20 mg/kg (n = 49). Aortic diameter (AD) measurements were used to determine the extent of aortic dilatation before and immediately after elastase perfusion and again at day 14.\nAll saline-treated mice developed AAAs associated with mononuclear inflammation and destruction of medial elastin (overall increase in AD, mean +/- SEM, 169.1% +/- 7.5%). In contrast, the incidence of AAAs was only 63% in PDTC-treated mice, with a reduction in the overall increase in AD to 109.8% +/- 4.2% ( P < .0001 vs saline), decreased inflammation, and structural preservation of aortic wall connective tissue. Although aneurysm development in saline-treated mice was associated with a marked increase in aortic tissue NF-kappaB and activator protein 1 DNA-binding activities, both activities were substantially reduced in PDTC-treated animals. PDTC-treated mice also exhibited significantly lower serum and aortic wall concentrations of interleukin 1beta and interleukin 6, as well as lower amounts of aortic wall MMP-9, as compared with saline-treated controls.\nTreatment with PDTC inhibits elastase-induced experimental AAAs in the mouse, along with suppression of aortic wall NF-kappaB and activator protein 1 transcription factor activities, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and suppression of MMP-9. NF-kappaB is therefore a potentially important therapeutic target for the suppression of aneurysmal degeneration.\nDevelopment and progression of human AAAs is associated with inflammation and enzymatic degradation of connective tissue proteins. MMP-9 is one of the enzymes involved in aneurysm disease, and its production may be induced in part by activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. In this mouse model, treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (a pharmacologic inhibitor of NF-kappaB) acted to suppress MMP-9 and aneurysm development. It is hoped that treatment strategies that target NF-kappaB may eventually be shown to suppress the growth of small aortic aneurysms in patients.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the natural history of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT), we examined factors that may contribute to the high mortality associated with UEDVT.\nFive hundred forty-six patients were diagnosed with acute internal jugular/subclavian/axillary deep venous thrombosis from January 1992 to June 2003 by duplex scanning at our institution. There were 329 women (60%). The mean age +/- SD was 68 +/- 17 years (range, 1-101 years). Risk factors for UEDVT were the presence of a central venous catheter or pacemaker in 327 patients (60%) and a history of malignancy in 119 patients (22%). Risk factors for mortality within 2 months of the diagnosis of UEDVT that were analyzed included age, sex, presence of a central venous catheter or pacemaker, history of malignancy, location of UEDVT, concomitant lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, systemic anticoagulation, placement of a superior vena caval filter, and pulmonary embolism.\nThe overall mortality rate at 2 months was 29.6%. The number of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism by positive ventilation/perfusion scan or computed tomographic scan was 26 (5%). The presence of a central venous catheter or pacemaker ( P < .001), concomitant lower extremity deep venous thrombosis ( P = .04), not undergoing systemic anticoagulation ( P = .002), and the placement of a superior vena caval filter ( P = .02) were associated with mortality within 2 months of the diagnosis of UEDVT by univariate analysis. Pulmonary embolism ( P = .42), sex ( P = .65), and a history of malignancy ( P = .96) were not.\nThese data suggest that the high associated mortality of UEDVT may be due to the underlying characteristics of the patients' disease process and may not be a direct consequence of the UEDVT itself.",

    "abstract": "Because stents can cause vessel angulation during movement, we hypothesized that internal carotid artery (ICA) stents might lead to alterations of cerebropetal blood flow. This study assessed three-dimensional anatomy and volumetric flow rate (VFR) in the ICA in various head positions by comparing patients treated with carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with patients treated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nThree-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance flow quantification were performed on six subjects after CAS (median age, 70 years) and on six subjects after CEA (median age, 67 years). All investigations were performed in five head positions: neutral, bent forward, bent backward, and turned to the treated, ipsilateral side and to the contralateral side. Maximum-intensity projection reconstructions were obtained to measure maximal angulation of the ICA in the forward, backward, ipsilateral, and contralateral positions compared with neutral. Subsequently, the plane perpendicular to the ICA, 1 cm distal to the stent or 4 cm distal to the carotid bifurcation (CEA patients), was established. The VFR through this plane was measured for each position, and the forward, backward, ipsilateral, and contralateral positions were compared with neutral.\nIn CAS patients, there was a median change in ICA angulation of +10.2 degrees (interquartile range, +7.3 degrees to +17.9 degrees ) in the forward position, compared with +0.2 degrees (-1.0 degrees to +2.4 degrees ) in CEA patients ( P = .016). In all other head positions, there was no statistically significant difference in angulation change. There was no statistically significant difference in VFR change between groups in any of the head positions tested.\nThere was a significant increase in ICA angulation in CAS patients if the head was bent forward; this was not observed in CEA patients. This angulation change did not lead to significant acute changes in cerebropetal blood flow, but it might have chronic effects not yet tested.",

    "abstract": "Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is commonly used as a screening modality for the detection of renal artery stenosis. However, evidence supporting its utility in clinical practice is lacking; few rigorous studies have compared MRA with contrast arteriography (CA). After making anecdotal clinical observations that MRA sometimes overestimated the degree of renal artery stenosis, we decided to determine the interobserver variability, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of MRA compared with CA.\nFrom September 1999 to April 2003, we evaluated 68 renal arteries in 34 patients with clinically suspected renal artery stenosis using both MRA and CA. All studies were independently reviewed by four blinded observers. Renal arteries were categorized by MRA as normal, <50%, and >50% stenosis/occlusion. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRA detection of renal artery stenosis were compared to CA as the gold standard. Interobserver variability (kappa) was also calculated.\nMRA demonstrated 87% sensitivity, 69% specificity, 85% accuracy, 95% negative predictive value, and 51% positive predictive value for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. Interobserver agreement was moderate for MRA (kappa = 0.53) and good for CA (kappa = 0.76). In 21 arteries (31%), MRA was falsely positive.\nIn patients with a high clinical suspicion of renal artery stenosis, MRA is 87% sensitive in the detection of >50% stenosis. However, MRA is relatively nonspecific compared with CA and results in significant overestimation of renal artery stenosis in nearly one third of patients. To reduce unnecessary CA, clinicians should consider supplemental studies.",

    "abstract": "Surgical revascularization of intestinal arteries is an effective long-term treatment for chronic intestinal ischemia (CII) regardless of the technique used. Conventional antegrade or retrograde bypass techniques are the most common modalities for extensive lesions that cannot be treated by endarterectomy or transposition. In this report, we describe our experience with an antegrade bypass technique from the ascending aorta in patients with no other available inflow.\nFrom April 1990 to May 2004, we performed antegrade bypass from the ascending aorta to the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), or both in five patients. These cases accounted for 2.4% of the 211 patients who underwent surgery on intestinal arteries during the study period.\nFour patients presented with symptomatic CII, and one patient had no intestinal ischemic symptoms. The underlying disease was Takayasu disease in two cases, Erdheim-Chester disease in one case, chronic aortic dissection in one case, and atherosclerosis in one case. Two patients had already undergone an unsuccessful revascularization attempt with another technique. Bypass was performed alone in three cases in association with revascularization of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and proximal descending thoracic aorta in one case and in association with revascularization of the ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch and renal autotransplantation in one case. Recovery was uneventful in all cases. One venous graft occluded because of technical defects and required reoperation for prosthetic graft replacement on the 10th postoperative day. Symptoms of CII resolved in all cases. Four months after the procedure, one patient underwent dilatation of an asymptomatic stenosis of the SMA distal to the bypass. During the 50th month after the procedure, a new re-stenosis of the SMA appeared. Left untreated, this stenosis led to asymptomatic occlusion of the mesenteric segment of a sequential aortoceliomesenteric bypass 13 months later. This aortoceliac bypass and the other four bypasses were patent after 4, 31, 46, 52, and 120 months of follow-up.\nAntegrade intestinal artery bypass from the ascending aorta is an effective alternative for patients who have no other available inflow for conventional antegrade or retrograde bypass and for patients in whom major technical difficulties are likely after multiple exposures of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Although indications are uncommon, antegrade intestinal artery bypass can provide durable revascularization of the intestine.",

    "abstract": "To assess the utility of a novel rapid urinary cotinine assay to detect and quantify the level of smoking in patients with peripheral arterial disease.\nThis was a cross-sectional study in a vascular surgical outpatient department of a large teaching hospital. Participants were 100 consecutive subjects presenting to a hospital outpatient clinic with a diagnosis of intermittent claudication confirmed by a positive Edinburgh claudication questionnaire and an ankle-brachial pressure index of less than 0.9. Main outcome measures were patient-offered smoking history, exhaled breath carbon monoxide levels, urinary cotinine levels as measured by a novel rapid assay, and laboratory-measured creatinine-adjusted urinary cotinine levels. Results Fifty-five subjects declared that they were current smokers, 40 declared that they were ex-smokers, and 5 declared that they were never-smokers. Of the 40 ex-smokers, 6 subjects (15%) had urinary cotinine levels greater than 500 ng/mL (regular smokers), and a further 2 (5%) had urinary cotinine levels between 100 and 500 ng/mL (light, irregular, or passive smokers). The rapid urinary cotinine assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 98%, respectively, in its ability to detect active smoking, and the degree of smoking correlated well with laboratory creatinine-corrected urinary cotinine levels (Spearman coefficient, 0.805; P < .001). By contrast, exhaled carbon monoxide had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 89%, respectively, and although it correlated well with urinary cotinine (Spearman coefficient, 0.782; P < .001), it was found on linear regression analysis to be unreliable in differentiating light smokers from nonsmokers.\nPatient-offered smoking history is unreliable because there is no correlation between the patient-reported number of cigarettes smoked per day and urinary cotinine levels. The novel rapid assay for urinary cotinine described here is superior to exhaled carbon monoxide measurement in detecting the level of smoking exposure among patients with intermittent claudication, and its results correlate well with laboratory-measured cotinine.",

    "abstract": "It has been argued that health status and quality of life (QOL) should be taken into account in the treatment policy of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In cardiac patients, it has been shown that poor perceived health status is an independent predictor of mortality and hospitalization. We therefore examined (1) the role of health status, QOL, and clinical indices of disease severity as determinants of invasive treatment in patients with PAD and (2) the effect of invasive treatment on health status and QOL.\nAt their first visit, patients completed the RAND 36-item Health Survey and World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument questionnaires to assess health status and QOL, respectively. During the 1-year follow-up period, data concerning hospitalization were derived from the patients' medical files. Furthermore, patients completed the RAND 36 and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument again at 1-year follow-up. The setting was a vascular outpatient clinic of a teaching hospital in Tilburg, The Netherlands; participants were 200 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with intermittent claudication, a common expression of PAD. Diagnosis was based on history, physical examination, treadmill walking distance, and ankle-brachial pressure indices. Main outcome measures were (1) invasive treatment of PAD that took place during the 1-year follow-up, derived from the patients' medical files, and (2) health status and QOL after 1 year of follow-up.\nAfter 1 year of follow-up, 107 patients (53.5%) were event free, whereas 77 patients (38.5%) had been hospitalized for invasive treatment of PAD. Sixteen patients (8%) were hospitalized for other cardiovascular reasons. In a multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-0.99; P = .024), pain-free walking distance (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.05-7.17; P = .04), and physical functioning (OR, 4.46; 95% CI, 1.79-11.12; P = .001) were independent predictors of invasive treatment of intermittent claudication. After 1 year of follow-up, patients who were treated invasively experienced a significant improvement in their physical functioning ( P = .004), role limitations due to emotional problems ( P = .018), and bodily pain ( P = .026).\nPatients with poor self-reported physical functioning, limited walking distance, and a younger age were likely to be treated invasively. The physician's clinical judgment about when to intervene adequately reflects the patient's own opinion about his or her health status. Invasive treatment led to a significant improvement in patients' health status. These findings indicate the effectiveness of the strategy to include patients' perceived physical functioning into the process of clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "To determine the efficacy, safety, and long-term results, including continued clinical improvement and limb salvage, of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nFrom August 1993 to March 2004, 138 limbs in 111 patients with CLI (rest pain in 62 [45%] and ulcer/gangrene in 76 [55%]) were treated by PTA. In iliac lesions, stents were placed selectively for primary PTA failure: residual stenosis (>30%) or pressure gradient (>5 mm Hg). Stent placement was limited in infrainguinal lesions. The most distal affected arteries treated with angioplasty were the iliac artery in 45 limbs (33%; iliac group), the femoropopliteal artery in 41 limbs (30%; FP group), and tibial arteries in 52 limbs (37%; BK group). All analysis was performed according to an intent-to-treat basis. Reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery were followed to evaluate initial success, and late follow-up status was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Patency was evaluated by using ultrasound scanning and ankle-brachial pressure index measurement.\nThere was one (0.9%) perioperative death. Twenty stents were placed selectively in 14 iliac arteries. Mean follow-up was 14.7 months (range, 1-75 months). Overall, initial technical and clinical success rates were 96.4% and 92.8%, respectively. The cumulative primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency; continued clinical improvement; and limb salvage rates +/- SE at 5 years were 31.4% +/- 10.4%, 75.5% +/- 5.7%, 79.6% +/- 5.5%, 36.1% +/- 10.0%, and 89.1% +/- 4.0%, respectively. In each subgroup, the primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency; continued clinical improvement; and limb salvage rates at 3 years were 51.6%, 94.7%, 97.8%, 65.1%, and 95.0%, respectively, in the iliac group; 49.4%, 72.2%, 76.4%, 57.4%, and 92.7%, respectively, in the FP group; and 23.5%, 41.8%, 46.1%, 51.1%, and 77.3%, respectively, in the BK group. Of the 12 predictable variables, hypertension, multiple segment lesions, more distal lesions, and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification type D were significant independent risk factors for the outcomes ( P < .05; univariate log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis).\nPTA is a feasible, safe, and effective procedure for the treatment of CLI. The high limb salvage rate is attributed to the high assisted primary and secondary patency rates despite the low primary patency rate. Angioplasty can be the primary choice for the treatment of CLI due to iliac and infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting can be used in stroke prevention in high-risk patients. As embolic complications can occur during carotid angioplasty and stenting, a device was developed to protect from cerebral embolization.\nBetween September 1999 and May 2002, carotid angioplasty and stenting was performed in 100 patients (84 men; mean age, 69.2 years) with symptomatic (26%) or asymptomatic (74%) severe carotid artery stenosis. Wallstents were used in all cases with selective pre-dilatation. Cerebral protection devices (Parodi Anti-Emboli System [PAES], ArteriA, San Francisco, Calif) were used in all patients. All patients were evaluated by a neurologist, both before and after the procedure. According to the criteria set forth by the large trials, the occurrence of minor, major or fatal stroke and myocardial infarction (end points) within 30 days and follow-up were determined as end points. Data were collected prospectively.\nThe overall perioperative stroke and death rate was 3% (1 noncorresponding minor stroke, 1 hemorrhagic stroke, and 1 cardiac event). Four patients developed postoperative transient neurologic events (three related to hemodynamic instability and the fourth due to postoperative embolization). The overall technical success rate for carotid angioplasty (protection device placed in position percutaneously) was 99%.\nThe efficacy and safety of carotid angioplasty and stenting with PAES are confirmed. This innovative protection device may prevent the debris released by angioplasty from entering the cerebral circulation. Further investigation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery balloon angioplasty and stenting (CBAS) is emerging as an acceptable alternative to carotid endarterectomy in selected high-risk patients. Conversely, patients with pre-existing renal impairment, diabetes, or both may be harmed by the nephrotoxic contrast agents required during CBAS. We attempted to limit or eliminate the use of contrast material during CBAS.\nEighteen patients with severe carotid stenoses (>70%) underwent CBAS at our institution over the last 12 months with duplex scan-assisted CBAS. Of these, 12 were primary procedures, and 6 were performed for carotid re-stenosis. Fourteen patients (78%) were neurologically asymptomatic. The average age of these patients was 75 +/- 11 years (range, 44-92 years). Hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level > or =1.5 mg/dL), coronary artery disease, diabetes, and smoking were present in 89%, 67%, 59%, 33%, and 28% of patients, respectively. Preoperative duplex carotid mapping was performed in all cases. All procedures were performed with patients under local anesthesia and light sedation.\nAn ATL HDI 5000 scanner with the SonoCT feature was used. The common femoral artery was cannulated with a single-entry needle under direct ultrasound visualization. Fluoroscopy was used to assist passage of the guidewire into the aorta and the common carotid artery. In only four cases (22%) was an aortic arch angiogram obtained. Selective catheterization of the internal and external carotid arteries was performed under ultrasound guidance. The distal cerebral protection device (17 cases) was placed under fluoroscopic guidance. Balloon width and length were chosen according to ultrasound measurements. Balloon and stent deployment were successfully achieved with ultrasound guidance alone in all cases. Appropriate stent apposition and resolution of the stenosis was confirmed by duplex scanning in all cases. Five patients (28%) were noted to have low (<100 mL/min) internal carotid artery volume flow after stent deployment (range, 20-88 mL/min; mean +/- SD, 50 +/- 25 mL/min). The internal carotid artery volume flow increased immediately after Filterwire retrieval in all cases and ranged from 136 to 400 mL/min (mean, 245 +/- 107 mL/min). This increase was statistically significant ( P < .02). No ipsilateral strokes or deaths occurred during follow-up from 1 to 12 months (mean follow-up, 5 months).\nDuplex scan-assisted CBAS is feasible and may reduce the need for intra-arterial contrast injection in selected patients deemed at high risk for renal failure from nephrotoxic contrast material. Additional advantages include direct visualization of the puncture site, precise position of the balloon and stent, and B-mode and hemodynamic confirmation of the adequacy of the technique.",

    "abstract": "The use of synthetic patch angioplasty during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been advocated to reduce restenosis, stroke, and death, but the type of material used is still being debated. This study compared rate of restenosis, neurologic events, and perioperative death in patients undergoing CEA with primary closure versus polyester urethane patch closure.\nIn a prospective randomized study, we compared patch angioplasty with polyester urethane (Vascular-patch, B. Braun Medical AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) to primary closure between February 1999 and March 2002 in 404 operations. Early (30-day) stroke and mortality rate, long-term restenosis, and neurologic events were compared in the two groups during 2.5 to 5 years of follow-up (median follow-up, 2 years).\nPrimary closure was used in 216 operations, and patch angioplasty was used in 206. Clamping time was significantly shorter in the primary closure group ( P < .001). Perioperative mortality and neurologic events were similar in both groups (1.9% vs 3.9%, P = .21, odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 9.85). The rate of residual stenosis (> or =50%) at 0 or 3-month follow-up was significantly lower in the patch group (2 operations, 1.1%) compared with the primary closure group (17 operations, 8.9%) ( P = .001, OR, 0.114; 95% CI, 0.026 to 0.5). Multivariable logistic regression showed that only primacy closure was found to influence residual stenosis. Restenosis of 70% was significantly less in the patch angioplasty group (2.2% vs 8.6%) ( P = . 01, hazard ratio, 0.246; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.75). No correlation was found between restenosis and gender, preoperative symptoms, or risk factors.\nPatch angioplasty with polyester urethane significantly reduced the restenosis rate ( P = . 01) compared with primary closure. Even though clamping time was longer, patching was not associated with more perioperative complications.",

Patients who underwent combined CEA-CABG were compared with all isolated CABG patients and a risk-matched cohort of isolated CABG patients.\nThe 35,539 isolated CABG patients had fewer postoperative complications than the 744 combined CEA-CABG patients, but also had a lower overall risk profile. The isolated CABG patients had a lower incidence of stroke (2% vs 5.1%), death (2% vs 4.4%), and combined stroke and death (3.7% vs 8.1%) compared with the combined group ( P < .001). After risk-factor matching, no differences in stroke (5% vs 5.1%), death (3.9% vs 4.4%), or combined stroke and death (8.5% vs 8.1%) were observed.\nAlthough increased complications are reported after CEA-CABG, these do not differ from those of a risk-matched cohort of isolated CABG patients.

This study was designed to compare early outcomes of open (OPEN) versus EVAR in a contemporary (2000 to 2003) large, multicenter prospective cohort.\nFourteen academic medical centers contributed data to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Private Sector (NSQIP-PS), which ensures uniform, comprehensive, prospective, and previously validated data entry by trained, independent nurse reviewers. A battery of clinical and demographic features was assessed with multivariate analysis for association with the principal study end points of 30-day operative mortality and morbidity.\nOne thousand forty-two patients underwent elective infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs: 460 EVAR and 582 OPEN. EVAR patients were older (74 vs 71 years, P < .0001), included more men (84.6% vs 79.6%, P < .05), and had a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25.4% vs 17.9%, P < .01). EVAR resulted in significantly reduced overall morbidity (24% vs 35%, P < .0001) and hospital stay (4 vs 9 days, P < .0001). Cardiopulmonary and renal function-related comorbidities had the expected significant impact on mortality for both procedures at univariate analysis ( P < .05). While crude mortality rates between EVAR and OPEN did not differ significantly (2.8% vs 4.0%) ( P = 0.32). After multivariate analysis, correlates of operative mortality included OPEN (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 5.78; P < .05), advanced age (OR, 1.11; P < .001), history of angina (OR, 5.54; P < .01), poor functional status (OR, 5.78; P < .001), history of weight loss (OR, 7.42; P < .01), and preoperative dialysis (OR, 51.4; P < .0001). EVAR also compared favorably to OPEN (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.89; P < .0001) for overall morbidity.\nSignificant morbidity accompanies AAA repair, even at major academic medical centers. These data strongly endorse EVAR as the preferred approach in the presence of significant cardiopulmonary or renal comorbidities, or poor preoperative functional status.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is considered to be less invasive and better tolerated by the cardiovascular system than open repair. Our aim was to assess the true incidence of perioperative myocardial damage associated with endovascular vs open infrarenal AAA repair.\nBetween July 1999 and June 2001, preoperative and postoperative serum troponin T (TnT) levels were measured in all patients presenting for elective AAA repair at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The incidence of myocardial damage was recorded on the basis of standard clinical, biochemical, and electrocardiographic changes or a subclinical increase of 50% or more in serum TnT. Patients were excluded if the TnT increase was associated with a significant increase of serum creatinine (> or =50%) with no other evidence of myocardial ischemia. The differences between the two groups were analyzed with the chi 2 test and odds ratios.\nA total of 35 open and 112 endovascular AAA repairs were included in the study. There was no significant difference in age, sex, preoperative serum creatinine, or preoperative serum TnT between the two treatment groups. Seventeen patients had biochemical evidence of myocardial damage, which was clinically obvious in only one patient. Even though the incidence of previous myocardial infarction was significantly higher in patients undergoing endovascular repair (41%) than open repair (22%; P < .05), the overall incidence of myocardial damage (clinical or subclinical) was significantly higher in the open group compared with the endovascular group (8 [25%] of 32 vs 9 [8%] of 109, respectively; odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-10.49; P < .02).\nThere is a previously underestimated incidence of subclinical myocardial damage associated with surgery for infrarenal AAA which is lower after endovascular than open repair.",

    "abstract": "A vascular surgeon has practiced in the same community for more than 20 years, holding privileges at the two largest local general hospitals. She is widely respected and admired by patients and fellow physicians in all specialties, and her results are consistently good. Recently, the board of directors at the hospital that has been the source of 80% of her case referrals hired a notorious slash-and-burn management firm to improve the balance sheet. The new chief executive officer (CEO) installed an information technology system that can provide management with physician-specific figures on costs and reimbursements. The management consultants identified the 10% of physicians with the worst cost/reimbursement ratios over the preceding 5 years and persuaded the board of directors to order their clinical privileges withdrawn. Our seasoned surgeon learns that she is among the targeted group. Is there an ethical issue here, and, if so, how should she respond?",

    "abstract": "An 18-year-old soldier had a gunshot wound to his left thigh during the Mexican Civil War (1910-1917). He presented with persistent bright red bleeding. His wound was treated by compression. A few years after the injury, he noticed a thrill, large varicose veins, limb swelling, and skin changes. A plain film showed an 8 x 10-cm midthigh mass. After a bullfighting incident, the pseudoaneurysm ruptured. Because of increased bulk and discomfort, the patient agreed 3 years later to be treated. Angiography showed a chronically obstructed femoral artery and vein. A 3000-mL hematoma was evacuated. This case illustrates the long-term sequelae of an arteriovenous fistula. This report describes a 51-year delay of treatment for causes unrelated to diagnosis. To our knowledge, this case is the longest delay in treatment of an arteriovenous fistula and its complications reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Aortoesophageal fistula secondary to thoracic aneurysm is rare and is usually fatal without prompt surgical intervention. A 79-year-old man with significant comorbidities and previous cancer surgery was admitted on an emergency basis because of the suspicion of a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm. Computed tomographic scan followed by angiography demonstrated a ruptured thoracic aneurysm with aortoesophageal fistula. An endovascular stent graft repair was performed with successful exclusion of both aneurysm and fistula. On postoperative day 6, dyspnea and an isolated episode of hemoptysis occurred. Endoscopy revealed the presence of a bronchoesophageal fistula, which necessitated double exclusion of the esophagus and feeding jejunostomy. At 6 months, clinical, bronchoscopic, and computed tomographic scan follow-up showed complete sealing of the aneurysm and resolution of the bronchoesophageal fistula. At 9 months, the patient was still alive but refused to undergo substernal gastric bypass in an attempt to restore oral feeding. Endovascular repair seems promising as an emergent and palliative treatment of aortoesophageal fistula. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which a bronchoesophageal fistula developed after successful endovascular repair of aortoesophageal fistula. The pathogenesis of this complications remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Neovascularization, angiogenesis, and collagen constriction are essential for wound healing. We tested whether vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) can promote collagen constriction, capillary sprouting (angiogenesis), and invasion/migration of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells into collagen (vasculogenesis).\nWe used a recently characterized three-dimensional collagen matrix assay with either monolayers of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) or bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BMD EPCs), obtained from Tie-2 LacZ transgenic mice, overlaid with an acellular layer and then a cellular layer of collagen embedded with fibroblasts, that were nontransduced or transduced with either LacZ adenoviral vector (Ad5) or VEGF-C/Ad5. The ability of VEGF-C to enhance fibroblast-mediated collagen constriction was measured, and gels overlying HMVECs or BMD EPCs were co-cultured, harvested, and assayed for HMVEC migration, sprouting, and capillary-like formation; gels containing BMD EPCs were assayed for EPC invasion/migration into the collagen extracellular matrix.\nVEGF-C significantly increased collagen constriction and formation of capillary-like structures with true lumina (P < .05) assessed by von Willebrand factor and VEGF receptor-2 immunoassaying. VEGF-C induced a significant increase in HMVEC migration, tubular polarization, and branching sprouts associated with a significant up-regulation of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) ( P < .05). Fibroblasts were necessary to support BMD-EPC invasion/migration from the monolayer into the collagen. Moreover, fibroblasts overexpressing VEGF-C significantly enhanced EPC invasion/migration ( P < .05) into the extracellular matrix by two-fold, and this effect could not be achieved with equivalent levels of exogenous VEGF-C in the absence of fibroblasts. The addition of a soluble VEGF-C competitor protein only partially inhibited these responses, reducing the EPCs by three-fold, but significant numbers of EPCs still invaded/migrated into the extracellular matrix, suggesting that other fibroblast-specific signals also contribute to the vasculogenic response.\nFibroblast-specific expression of VEGF-C promotes collagen constriction by fibroblasts and enhances microvascular endothelial cell migration, branching, and capillary sprouting in association with up-regulating MT1-MMP expression. Fibroblasts are necessary for BMD EPC invasion/migration into collagen, and their overexpression of VEGF-C enhances this fibroblast-mediated vasculogenic effect. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for VEGF-C in multiple biologic steps required for wound healing (angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and collagen constriction).\nIschemic wound healing remains an unsolved problem with no previously identified molecular target for therapeutic intervention. This study demonstrates that VEGF-C overexpression by fibroblasts stimulates multiple biologic processes known to impact wound healing, such as collagen constriction, capillary sprouting, and EPC invasion and migration through extracellular matrix. Most ischemic wounds fail to heal and frequently lead to major limb amputation. Available cytokine ointments are ineffective, and revascularization is often not technically feasible. Even when these procedures are accomplished, many ischemic wounds frequently still do not heal because of multifactorial tissue level impairments in the fibroblastic and neovascularization responses at the wound base. Our findings identify an important role for two novel tissue level targets, dermis-derived fibroblasts and VEGF-C, in collagen constriction, angiogenesis, and postnatal vasculogenesis from BMD EPCs. Thus the findings are particularly relevant to the unsolved clinical problem of ischemic wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Resistin, a novel adipocyte-derived cytokine, is involved in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. In this study, we determined whether resistin could affect vasomotor function, oxidative stress, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in porcine coronary arteries.\nPorcine coronary arteries were treated with resistin or antioxidant seleno-L-methionine (SeMet). Vasomotor function was studied by using a myograph system. Levels of superoxide anion (O 2 - ) were detected by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method. The eNOS mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Culture of isolated porcine coronary artery endothelial cells (PCAECs) was also included.\nEndothelium-dependent relaxation in response to bradykinin was reduced by 15% and 30% for the rings treated with 10 and 40 ng/mL of resistin, respectively, as compared with controls ( P < .05). Endothelium-independent relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was also reduced by 11% after treatment with 40 ng/mL of resistin ( P < .05). The O 2 - level was increased in the 40 ng/mL resistin-treated vessels by 88% as compared with controls ( P < .05). SeMet reversed these effects. The eNOS mRNA levels in PCAEC cultures treated with resistin (10 and 40 ng/mL) were decreased by 27% and 55%, respectively ( P < .05) and by 39% in the endothelial cells purified from porcine coronary artery rings after treatment with 40 ng/mL of resistin ( P < .05). Immunoreactivity of eNOS in the resistin-treated vessel rings was also substantially reduced.\nResistin reduces the endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation. This effect is associated with increased superoxide radical production, decreased eNOS expression, and is effectively reversed by the antioxidant SeMet.\nObesity has been considered to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and other vascular lesions. Resistin is a newly discovered adipocyte-derived cytokine, and its plasma levels are increased in obese individuals. However, it is not clear whether resistin could directly contribute to vascular disease formation. This study showed that resistin can cause endothelial dysfunction in porcine coronary arteries through oxidative stress and down-regulation of eNOS. Thus, this study may suggest a new mechanism of obesity-associated vascular disease and that antioxidants may effectively prevent vascular disease in obese individuals.",

    "abstract": "The healing response to vascular injury is characterized by neointimal thickening. Proliferation and phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) have been implicated in this process. We sought to investigate the role of survivin, a dual regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis, in lesion formation after diverse forms of vascular injury.\nRabbits underwent either carotid interposition vein grafting (n = 17) or bilateral femoral balloon injury (BI; n = 29); some in the BI group were placed on a high-cholesterol diet. A subset of BI arteries were treated with local adenoviral gene delivery of a survivin dominant negative-mutant (AdT34A) versus vector or saline controls. Survivin expression in vessels was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which also included markers of SMC differentiation. Specimens of human tissue including failed lower extremity bypass grafts and carotid plaque were also examined.\nRT-PCR and IHC demonstrated increased survivin expression in all experimental models, colocalizing at early times with proliferating and alpha-actin-expressing cells but was largely absent in mature, contractile SMCs. Delivery of AdT34A after BI attenuated neointimal hyperplasia.\nThese studies provide strong evidence supporting a role for survivin in the cellular response to vascular injury.\nThe regulation of cell proliferation, death, and phenotype after vascular interventions remains incompletely understood. We investigated the role of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin in diverse models of vascular injury. The results suggest that survivin is an important modulator of the generalized vascular injury response and may represent a relevant target for therapies targeting intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) a key serine protease during remodeling, is capable of inducing both smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. However, the signals that produce these responses are poorly understood.\nEarly passage rat aortic arterial smooth muscle cells were cultured in vitro and standard assays of DNA synthesis ([ 3 H]thymidine incorporation), cell proliferation (manual cell counting), and migration (linear wound assay and Boyden chamber) were used to study the cells responses to uPA. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK , Akt, MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK1/2), MAP kinase kinase (MKK)3/6, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in response to uPA was assayed by Western blot analysis for the phosphorylated form of each kinase. These assays were repeated in the presence of the Galphai inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTx, 100 ng/mL), the Ras inhibitor manumycin A (MA, 10 microM), the phosphatidyl-inositol 3' kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (WN, 1 microM), the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (AG, 10 nM), the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (PD, 10 microM), the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (SB, 10 microM), and the plasmin inhibitors aprotinin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid.\nuPA induced a twofold increase in smooth muscle cell migration and increased smooth muscle cell DNA synthesis and proliferation. The ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK inhibitors PD98059 (PD) and SB203580 (SB) blocked cell proliferation, but only PD blocked cell migration. Although uPA-induced phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was blocked by Galphai inhibition, inhibition of PI3K and Ras decreased the uPA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not p38 MAPK . Activation of MEK1/2 was abrogated by inhibitors of Galphai and Ras, but not by PI3K inhibition. In contrast, activation of MKK3/6 was abrogated by inhibition of Galphai, but not by Ras or PI3K inhibition. uPA induced time-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR, which was dependent on plasmin activity. Inhibition of EGFR reduced both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation. uPA activation of PI3K and MKK3/6 was EGFR-dependent and that of MEK1 was EGFR-independent.\nuPA induces smooth muscle cell proliferation through ERK1/2- and p38 MAPK -mediated pathways. Migration appears to be dependent on ERK1/2 activity alone. Activation of EGFR appears to be required. The differential activation of pathways for ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK by uPA allows for two distinct biologic responses that both require tyrosine kinase receptor transactivation.\nElevated urokinase-like plasminogen activator (uPA) and decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels are predictors for restenosis. Matrix remodeling and smooth muscle cell responses are integrally linked. Changes in smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation are dependent on the extracellular matrix environment in which they are encased. Proteases such as uPA can effect smooth muscle cells and alter the matrix; their activity is controlled by a series of inhibitors (eg, PAI-1). The balance of activation and inhibition forms the basis of the proteolytic thermostat in the vessel wall. Understanding the biology of the proteolytic thermostat will allow for structured therapeutic interventions to control restenosis and thus improve patient care and avoid secondary interventions. Our study demonstrates that uPA is capable of inducing separate responses through more than one signaling pathway, in part, by transactivation of a nearby receptor for the unrelated ligand epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Blockade of EGFR can inhibit both cell migration and proliferation induced by uPA. This is the first description of cross talk between uPA and EGFR in vascular smooth muscle cells. Targeting a pivotal receptor such as EGFR, which can be transactivated by both G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, is an attractive molecular target to control restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Migration of endovascular stent grafts has been related to the security of proximal device fixation to the aortic neck. This study evaluated the importance of iliac fixation in preventing longitudinal in vivo device displacement of a modular, externally supported stent graft.\nExperimental ovine infrarenal aneurysms (n = 8) were treated with a fully supported, modular, bifurcated stent graft (AneuRx, Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif). Minimum iliac fixation length (1 cm) was used in four animals and iliac extender modules were used to achieve maximum iliac fixation in four animals. Suture anastomosis of bifurcated polyester grafts to the infrarenal aorta served as controls (n = 8). Aortic grafts were displaced in vivo by applying downward traction to a guidewire that was passed over the iliac flow divider and brought out both femoral arteries. The displacement force needed to initiate stent-graft migration was recorded and compared with the force needed to disrupt the sutured anastomosis.\nThere was no difference in animal weight (88.8 +/- 2.5 kg vs 87.5 +/- 2.9 kg), aortic neck diameter (12.7 +/- 0.9 mm vs 13.4 +/- 1.1 mm), aortic neck length (23.2 +/- 0.9 mm vs 21.8 +/- 2.4 mm), experimental aneurysm size (24.7 +/- 1.1 mm vs 24.2 +/- 2.0 mm), or iliac artery diameter (9.0 +/- 1.5 mm vs 9.3 +/- 0.5 mm) among the groups. Iliac fixation length was 31.0 +/- 0.3 mm in the maximum iliac fixation group and 11 +/- 0.25 mm in the minimum fixation group (P < .0001). Peak displacement force to initiate migration was 30.2 +/- 5.5 N (range, 25 to 38) in animals with maximum iliac fixation compared with 18.1 +/- 3.7 N (range, 13 to 21) in those with minimum fixation (P = .01). The force needed to disrupt the control surgical anastomosis was 40.6 +/- 7.5 N (range, 31 to 50) (P < .01).\nMaximizing iliac fixation length increases the longitudinal in vivo force needed to displace a fully supported stent graft by 67%. This suggests that increasing iliac fixation length may reduce the long-term risk of migration in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that type II endoleak size is a predictor of aneurysm growth after aortic endografting. To better understand this observation, we investigated the influence of endoleak size on pressure transmitted to the aneurysm wall and its distribution within the aneurysm sac.\nIn an ex vivo model, an artificial aneurysm sac was incorporated within a mock circulation comprised of rubber tubing and a pulsatile pump. Three strain-gauge pressure transducers were placed in the aneurysm wall at different locations, including the site of maximum aneurysm diameter. The aneurysm was filled with either human aneurysm thrombus or dough that mimicked thrombus and simulated type II endoleaks of varying volumes (1 to 10 mL) were created. Aneurysm wall pressure (AWP) measurements were recorded at mean arterial pressures (MAPs) of 60, 80, and 100 mm Hg. Correlation coefficients ( r ) and analysis of variance were used to assess the relationship between endoleak volume and AWP.\nIncreasing endoleak volume '3 cm 3 resulted in proportionally increased AWP at all levels of MAP and at all sites, with highest pressures recorded at the site of the maximum aneurysm diameter (r = 0.83 when MAP = 100 mm Hg; r = 0.85 when MAP = 80 mm Hg; r = 0.88 when MAP = 60 mm Hg; P < .001). AWP plateaued when the endoleak volume was >3 cm 3 . Pressure distribution within the sac was not uniform. Although the difference was within +/-10%, statistically significant higher AWPs were observed at the site of maximum aneurysm diameter (P <.001). AWP also correlated with MAP.\nIncreasing type II endoleak volume results in proportionally higher AWP, which is greatest at the site of maximum aneurysm diameter. This study confirms the clinical observation that type II endoleak volume and MAP may be important predictors of aneurysm expansion.\nOur experimental model of a type II endoleak revealed that endoleak size is a significant factor that influences the magnitude of pressure transmission into the aneurysm wall. Increasing volume of the endoleak nidus was associated with proportionally higher aneurysm sac pressures. This mechanism may, in fact, account for the increased risk of aneurysm expansion observed in our clinical experience, thereby suggesting the need for more aggressive surveillance and possibly earlier intervention for patients with larger endoleaks.",

    "abstract": "Varicose veins have been linked to great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux and in particular, with reflux at the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ). Early stages of disease, however, may be associated with limited, localized reflux in segments of the GSV and/or small saphenous vein (SSV). Ultrasound mapping of saphenous veins was performed to determine patterns of GSV and SSV reflux in women with simple, primary varicose veins.\nUltrasound mapping was performed prospectively in 590 extremities of 326 women with varicose veins (CEAP C 2 class) but without edema, skin changes, or ulcers (C 3 to C 6 ). Average age was 42 +/- 13 (SD) years (range, 8 to 87). Patterns of GSV and SSV reflux, obtained in the upright position, were classified as I: perijunctional, originating from the SFJ or saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) tributaries into the GSV or SSV; II: proximal, from the SFJ or SPJ to a tributary or perforating vein above the level of the malleoli; III: distal, from a tributary or perforating vein to the paramalleolar GSV or SSV; IV: segmental, from a tributary or perforating vein to another tributary or perforating vein above the malleoli; V; multisegmental, if two or more distinct refluxing segments were detected; and VI: diffused, involving the entire GSV or SSV from the SFJ or SPJ to the malleoli.\nReflux was detected in 472 extremities (80%): 100 (17%) had reflux in both the GSV and SSV, 353 (60%) had GSV reflux only, and 19 (3%) had SSV reflux only, for a total prevalence of 77% at the GSV and 20% at the SSV. The most common pattern of GSV reflux was segmental (types IV and V) in 342 (58%) of 590; either one segment in 213 (36%) or more than one segment with competent SFJ in 99 (17%), or incompetent SFJ in 30 (5%), followed by distal GSV reflux (type III) in 65 (11%), proximal GSV reflux (type II) in 32 (5%), diffused throughout the entire GSV (type VI) in 10 (2%), and perijunctional (type I) in 4 (<1%). GSV refluxing segments were noted in the SFJ in 72 (12%) and in the thigh in 220 (37%), and leg (or both) in 345 (58%).\nThe high prevalence of reflux justifies ultrasound mapping of the saphenous veins in women with primary varicose veins. Correction of SFJ reflux, however, may be needed in <or=12% of the extremities, and only about one third CEAP C2 limbs may require treatment of a refluxing GSV in the thigh.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of wartime injuries has led to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular trauma. Recent experience has stimulated a reappraisal of the management of such injuries, specifically assessing the effect of explosive devices on injury patterns and treatment strategies. The objective of this report is to provide a single-institution analysis of injury patterns and management strategies in the care of modern wartime vascular injuries.\nFrom December 2001 through March 2004, all wartime evacuees evaluated at a single institution were prospectively entered into a database and retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included site, type, and mechanism of vascular injury; associated trauma; type of vascular repair; initial outcome; occult injury; amputation rate; and complication. Liberal application of arteriography was used to assess these injuries. The results of that diagnostic and therapeutic approach, particularly as it related to the care of the blast-injured patient, are reviewed.\nOf 3057 soldiers evacuated for medical evaluation, 1524 (50%) sustained battle injuries. Known or suspected vascular injuries occurred in 107 (7%) patients, and these patients comprised the study group. Sixty-eight (64%) patients were wounded by explosive devices, 27 (25%) were wounded by gunshots, and 12 (11%) experienced blunt traumatic injury. The majority of injuries (59/66 [88%]) occurred in the extremities. Nearly half (48/107) of the patients underwent vascular repair in a forward hospital in Iraq or Afghanistan. Twenty-eight (26%) required additional operative intervention on arrival in the United States. Vascular injuries were associated with bony fracture in 37% of soldiers. Twenty-one of the 107 had a primary amputation performed before evacuation. Amputation after vascular repair occurred in 8 patients. Of those, 5 had mangled extremities associated with contaminated wounds and infected grafts. Sixty-seven (63%) patients underwent diagnostic angiography. The most common indication was mechanism of injury (42%), followed by abnormal examination (33%), operative planning (18%), or evaluation of a repair (7%).\nThis interim report represents the largest analysis of US military vascular injuries in more than 30 years. Wounding patterns reflect past experience with a high percentage of extremity injuries. Management of arterial repair with autologous vein graft remains the treatment of choice. Repairs in contaminated wound beds should be avoided. An increase in injuries from improvised explosive devices in modern conflict warrants the more liberal application of contrast arteriography. Endovascular techniques have advanced the contemporary management and proved valuable in the treatment of select wartime vascular injuries.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of carotid endarterectomy on blood pressure homeostasis and baroreflex function, with particular reference to the presence or absence of significant contralateral carotid artery disease, we conducted a prospective study in 80 patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid disease undergoing carotid endarterectomy in a regional teaching hospital over 2 years.\nPatients were divided into two groups: the control group (n = 37) had no significant contralateral carotid disease; patients in the diseased group (n = 23) had either >70% stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery. Seventeen patients with abnormal heart rhythms, poor quality recordings, or with intermediate degrees of contralateral carotid stenosis were excluded. Three patients who had previously undergone contralateral carotid endarterectomy were separately evaluated. Atheromatous plaque was removed from carotid lumen and the baroreflex mechanism received direct intraoperative stimulation before and after carotid endarterectomy. The main outcome measures were (1) the hemodynamic response to the carotid endarterectomy, baroreflex sensitivity, and operating set point (the resting blood pressure, which the baroreflex mechanism maintains) before and after removal of the atheromatous plaque, and (2) the responsiveness of the ipsilateral baroreceptor mechanism to direct stimulation. The impact of the presence of contralateral carotid stenosis on these variables was also evaluated.\nPatients in the two groups were comparable for preoperative demographic, medication, and hemodynamic variables. Carotid endarterectomy led to a rise in mean arterial pressure from 81.3 +/- 3.9 mm Hg to 103.5 +/- 4.6 mm Hg ( P < .00001) and from 87.6 +/- 4.3 mm Hg to 94.0 +/- 4.5 mm Hg ( P < .003) in the diseased and control groups, respectively. The magnitude of blood pressure response was significantly greater in the diseased group than in the control group ( P < .00001). This hypertensive shift was not accompanied by the expected fall in heart rate. Direct baroreflex stimulation prior to carotid endarterectomy caused a significantly greater response in the diseased group, suggesting sensitization of the ipsilateral carotid baroreceptor in the presence of contralateral carotid disease. Furthermore, the baroreflex response was obliterated after endarterectomy. There were significant reductions in baroreflex sensitivity and a hypertensive shift in the operating set point, the magnitude of which was significantly greater in patients with contralateral carotid disease.\nCarotid endarterectomy impairs blood pressure homeostasis through surgical destruction of the ipsilateral carotid baroreflex mechanism. Patients with contralateral carotid stenosis have a reduced baroreflex reserve and show greater baroreflex dysfunction and hemodynamic instability after endarterectomy. These patients are at greater risk of postendarterectomy complications and should be monitored closely.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the relation between functional measures of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) severity with both disease-specific and generic self-reported health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) measures, as well as the relation between the two types of HR-QOL measures.\nThis was a cross-sectional observation of participants from the community and primary care or vascular surgery clinics in an academic Veterans Administration medical center. Eighty patients with symptomatic Fontaine stage II PAD provided physiologic measures and self-response questionnaires. Objective measures included the ankle-brachial index (ABI), time to maximum claudication pain on a graded exercise test, and a 6-minute floor-walking distance. Self-reports included the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), a disease-specific HR-QOL measure and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short-Form 36 (SF-36), a generic HR-QOL measure.\nPatients (mean age 70 +/- 8 [+/- SD] and 85% men) exhibited moderate-to-severe PAD by objective measures of ABI (0.65 +/- 0.19) and time in minutes to maximal claudication on a graded exercise test (7:54 +/- 4:58). Significant correlations were found between these measures and the WIQ distance, MOS-Physical Function, and MOS-Role Limitations due to physical dysfunction. The SF-36 and the WIQ subscales were significantly correlated.\nIn older PAD patients with intermittent claudication, objective measures of disease severity are correlated with a self-reported, disease-specific and generic HR-QOL.",

    "abstract": "The outcomes of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) are, in addition to patient baseline characteristics, highly dependent on the safety of the endovascular procedure. During the successive stages of CAS, transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the middle cerebral artery was used to assess the association of cerebral embolism and hemodynamic changes with transient (amaurosis fugax and transient ischemic attack) and persistent (minor and major stroke) cerebral deficits, and death.\nBy use of a prospectively completed database of 550 patients, the association of various TCD emboli and velocity variables with periprocedural cerebral outcome <or=7 days was evaluated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses in combination with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. The impact of basic patient characteristics, such as age, sex, preprocedural cerebral symptoms, and ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy before CAS was also evaluated.\nWe observed 36 patients with amaurosis fugax (n = 6; 1.1%) or transient ischemic attack (n = 30; 5.4%), 1 patient (0.2%) with an ipsilateral retinal infarct, and 21 patients with minor (n = 15; 2.7%) or major (n = 6; 1.1%) stroke, respectively. Five patients (0.9%) died. Multiple showers of microemboli (>5) at postdilation after stent deployment (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 5.1), particulate macroembolus (OR, 27.0; 95% CI, 4.5 to 157), and massive air embolism (OR, 51.4; 95% CI, 5.4 to 492), as well as angioplasty-induced asystole and prolonged hypotension with a >70% reduction of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.3 to 17.8) were independently associated with cerebral deficits. The ROC area of this model was 0.72. Of the patient characteristics, only preprocedural cerebral ischemia (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.4 to 10.4) was associated with outcome. Adding this patient characteristic to the model, the area under the ROC curve increased to 0.80.\nIn CAS, in addition to such obviously adverse events as particulate macroembolism and massive air embolism, multiple microemboli (>5 showers) at postdilation after stent deployment and angioplasty-induced asystole and hypotension with a significant reduction of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities are associated with periprocedural cerebral deficits. In combination with the presence of preprocedural cerebral symptoms, these four TCD monitoring variables reasonably differentiate between patients with and without adverse cerebral outcome. TCD monitoring provides insight into the pathogenesis of CAS related adverse cerebral events.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that higher neutrophil counts are associated with an increased incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with clinically advanced atherosclerosis.\nWe prospectively studied 398 patients (233 men; median age, 69 years) with symptomatic peripheral artery disease who were admitted to the inpatient ward of the angiology department of a tertiary care university hospital in a cohort study. Total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts were obtained, and patients were followed for MACE, defined as myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting, stroke, carotid revascularization, and death.\nDuring a median follow-up of 20 months, 140 MACE occurred in 105 patients (26%). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the association of differential WBC count parameters (in tertiles) with MACE and their interrelation with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and other parameters of inflammation. Patients with neutrophil counts >5.8 G/L (upper tertile) exhibited an increased adjusted risk for all MACE (hazards ratio [HR], 1.83; P = .017), death (HR, 3.39; P = .010), and the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death (HR, 2.20; P = . 012) compared with patients in the lower tertile (<4.4 G/L), independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Only neutrophils, but not eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, or the total WBC count showed a significant association with cardiovascular outcome.\nIn patients with peripheral artery disease, neutrophil counts in the upper tertile (>5.8 G/L) indicate a substantially increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, adding to the prognostic information of traditional atherothrombotic risk factors and other parameters of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether a pragmatic policy of perioperative beta-blockade, with metoprolol, reduced the 30-day cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduced the length of hospital stay in average patients undergoing infrarenal vascular surgery.\nThis was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial that occurred in vascular surgical units in four UK hospitals. Participants were 103 patients without previous myocardial infarction who had infrarenal vascular surgery between July 2001 and March 2004. Interventions were oral metoprolol (50 mg twice daily, supplemented by intravenous doses when necessary) or placebo from admission until 7 days after surgery. Holter monitors were kept in place for 72 hours after surgery.\nEighty men and 23 women (median age, 73 years) were randomized, 55 to metoprolol and 48 to placebo, and 97 (94%) underwent surgery during the trial. The most common operations were aortic aneurysm repair (38%) and distal bypass (29%). Intraoperative inotropic support was required in 64% and 92% of patients in the placebo and metoprolol groups, respectively. Within 30 days, cardiovascular events occurred in 32 patients, including myocardial infarction (8%), unstable angina (9%), ventricular tachycardia (19%), and stroke (1%). Four (4%) deaths were reported. Cardiovascular events occurred in 15 (34%) and 17 (32%) patients in the placebo and metoprolol groups, respectively (unadjusted relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.66; adjusted [for age, sex, statin use, and aortic cross-clamping] relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-1.55).

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgical treatment for atypical aortic coarctation due to Takayasu's arteritis and to elucidate the factors that affected outcome.\nThe outcomes of surgical treatment for atypical aortic coarctation complicating Takayasu's arteritis in 33 consecutive patients over the previous 44 years at our institution were reviewed retrospectively. Preoperatively, 29 patients had coarctation proximal to the renal arteries and hypertension in the upper half of the body. Four hospital deaths occurred, and the remaining 29 patients were followed from 0.5 to 42.0 years (median, 17.9 years). The impacts of several risk factors on survival as well as cardiac and vascular events were analyzed.\nAmong 27 initial survivors who had hypertension preoperatively, 15 did not show normalization of blood pressure. The overall cumulative survival and event-free survival rate at 20 years were 62.3% and 58.4%, respectively. Serious long-term complications were anastomotic aneurysms, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, graft deterioration, abdominal aortic aneurysms, and renal failure. Among several risk factors analyzed, only the presence of postoperative hypertension had an effect on event-free survival.\nThe long-term survival after surgery for atypical aortic coarctation was satisfactory. However, our study showed that complications associated with cardiovascular system or the operation could occur at any time after surgery; thus, life-long follow-up is mandatory. Further, the absence of normalization of blood pressure after surgery was a poor prognostic factor. Our results demonstrate the need for an intimate preoperative evaluation of renal and carotid artery lesions, which often coexist and may also cause secondary hypertension, to fully manage hypertension by surgery.",

Surgical modification of proximal or distal fixation sites was performed when necessary to establish adequate regions for device landing zones. Follow-up studies included radiographic evaluation before discharge and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. Aortic morphologic characteristics were determined by using three-dimensional imaging studies and centerline of flow measurements. Statistical analyses were performed with Kaplan Meier analysis to assess survival, factors predictive of poor outcome, and morphologic changes, including sac shrinkage.\nA total of 100 patients (42% women) were treated, including 81 aneurysms, 15 aortic dissections (with aneurysms), 2 patients with fistulous connections (1 aortobronchial and 1 aortoesophageal), 1 subclavian artery aneurysm, and 1 aortic rupture. Mean follow-up and aneurysm size were 14 months and 62 mm, respectively. Most patients (55%) had undergone prior aortic aneurysm repair. Surgical modifications were required to create adequate implantation sites in 29% patients, including 14 elephant trunk/arch reconstructions, 18 carotid-subclavian bypasses, and 4 visceral vessel bypasses. Iliac conduits were required in 19 patients. Overall mortality was 17%, and aneurysm-related mortality was 14% at 1 year. Sac regression (>5 mm maximum diameter decrease) was observed in 52% and 56% at 12 and 24 months. Growth was noted in one patient (1.6%) at 12 months. Endoleaks were detected in eight patients (8.5%) at 30 days and three patients (6%) at 12 months. Secondary interventions were required in 15 patients. Migration (>10 mm) of the proximal or distal stent was noted in three patients (6%) (two proximal and one distal), none of which required treatment or resulted in an adverse event.\nAcceptable intermediate-term outcomes have been achieved in the treatment of high-risk patients in the setting of both favorable and challenging anatomic situations with these devices. The complexity of the patient population, in contrast to endovascular infrarenal repair, attests to the differences in the pathophysiology aortic disease in the anatomic beds.",

    "abstract": "During endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR), the rapid deployment of the Gore Excluder endograft may be associated with anatomic shortening of the endograft path. This shortened path may result in coverage of the hypogastric artery origin or overly conservative graft length selection that may lead to unnecessary extensions. We quantified the degree of path alteration with this endograft and developed an algorithm to predict it.\nPreoperative and postoperative three-dimensional (3D) computed tomographic (CT) scans were evaluated for 50 consecutive patients with Gore Excluder endografts by using 21 anatomic measurements and 6 calculated indices. Measurements were evaluated as if only 3D lumen centerline measurements were available, rather than complete 3D computer-aided measurement and \"virtual graft\" simulation. Tortuosity was quantitated from the renal artery to the hypogastric origin, using the difference between a straight line and the lumen centerline.\nThe endograft was deployed successfully in all cases. The graft end points were typically quite close to the preoperative plan: mean renal artery-to-graft distance was within 2.0 +/- .5 mm, and the limb end point-to-hypogastric origin differed by an average of only 1.8 +/- 1.6 mm. Although accurate in most cases, the actual graft path shortened 1 cm or more relative to the centerline in 11% of limbs. On univariate analysis, determinants of alteration of >1 cm in the graft deployment path were (1) aortoiliac tortuosity (renal-to-hypogastric artery, P < .002), (2) the degree of planned graft rotation (73% of cases altered >10 mm were in the rotated position, P < .05), and (3) the insertion side (73% of alterations >or=10 mm were ipsilateral to the main device, P < .05). On multivariate analysis, the renal-to-hypogastric artery tortuosity index (RHTI) was significant ( P < .004), and device type and rotation approached significance ( P < .08). We developed a classification scheme based on RHTI to predict the risk of alteration of the graft path >or=1 cm (low risk, 0%; medium risk, 10%; high risk, 25%) and an algorithm to predict the degree of alteration of the anatomy that reduced the number of cases shortening >or=1 cm to zero.\nThe graft deployment path will be altered significantly in a minority of cases with the Gore Excluder endograft, but this can cause hypogastric occlusion or other problems. Anatomic shortening is predictable from morphologic features such as tortuosity, graft insertion side, and rotation. We developed an algorithm based on a tortuosity index that quantitates the risk and degree of shortening associated with endograft deployment.",

    "results": "The endograft was deployed successfully in all cases. The graft end points were typically quite close to the preoperative plan: mean renal artery-to-graft distance was within 2.0 +/- .5 mm, and the limb end point-to-hypogastric origin differed by an average of only 1.8 +/- 1.6 mm. Although accurate in most cases, the actual graft path shortened 1 cm or more relative to the centerline in 11% of limbs. On univariate analysis, determinants of alteration of >1 cm in the graft deployment path were (1) aortoiliac tortuosity (renal-to-hypogastric artery, P < .002), (2) the degree of planned graft rotation (73% of cases altered >10 mm were in the rotated position, P < .05), and (3) the insertion side (73% of alterations >or=10 mm were ipsilateral to the main device, P < .05). On multivariate analysis, the renal-to-hypogastric artery tortuosity index (RHTI) was significant ( P < .004), and device type and rotation approached significance ( P < .08). We developed a classification scheme based on RHTI to predict the risk of alteration of the graft path >or=1 cm (low risk, 0%; medium risk, 10%; high risk, 25%) and an algorithm to predict the degree of alteration of the anatomy that reduced the number of cases shortening >or=1 cm to zero.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed using population-based data to determine the changing trends in the techniques for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the state of Illinois during the past 9 years and to examine the extent to which endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has influenced overall AAA management.\nAll records of patients who underwent AAA repair (1995 to 2003 inclusive) were retrieved from the Illinois Hospital Association COMPdata database. The outcome as determined by in-hospital mortality was analyzed according to intervention type (open vs EVAR) and indication (elective repair vs ruptured AAA). Data were stratified by age, gender, and hospital type (university vs community setting) and then analyzed using both univariate (chi 2 , t tests) and multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) techniques.\nBetween 1995 and 2003, 14,517 patients underwent AAA repair (85% for elective and 15% for ruptured AAA). The average age was 71.4 +/- 7.9 years, and 76% were men. For elective cases, open repair was performed in 86% and EVAR in 14%; and for ruptured cases, open repair in 97% and EVAR in 3%. Elective EVAR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality compared with open repair regardless of age. No differences were observed with age after either type of repair for a ruptured aneurysm. Men had a lower in-hospital mortality compared with women for open repair of both elective and ruptured aneurysms. For EVAR, the mortality of an elective repair was lower in men, but there was no difference after a ruptured AAA. In men, the difference in mortality between elective open repair and EVAR was significant; the type of institution did not influence outcome. Patients >80 years of age had a higher mortality after open repair for both elective and ruptured AAA and after EVAR of a ruptured AAA. The average length of stay was 9.9 days for open elective repair, 13.1 days after open repair of a ruptured AAA, and 3.6 days for EVAR. The independent predictors of higher in-hospital mortality were female gender, age >80 years, diagnosis (ruptured vs open), and procedure (open vs EVAR). The year of the procedure and type of hospital (university vs community) were not predictive of outcome.\nEVAR has had a significant impact on AAA management in Illinois over a relatively short time period. In this population-based review, EVAR was associated with a significantly decreased in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Octogenarians had higher mortality after both types of repair, with the exception of elective EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Popliteal artery aneurysms can be treated endovascularly with less perioperative morbidity compared with open repair. To evaluate suitability of the endovascular technique and the clinical results of this treatment, we analyzed a prospective cohort of consecutive popliteal aneurysms referred to a tertiary university vascular center.\nAll popliteal artery aneurysms between June 1998 and June 2004 that measured >20 mm in diameter were analyzed for endovascular repair. Anatomic suitability was based largely on quality of the proximal and distal landing zone as determined by angiography. Endovascular treatment was performed by using a nitinol-supported expanded polytetrafluoroethylene lined stent graft introduced through the common femoral artery.\nWe analyzed 67 aneurysms in 57 patients. Ten aneurysms (15%) were excluded from endovascular repair, or from any repair at all, for various reasons. The remaining 57 (85%) were treated endovascularly, of which 5 were treated emergently for acute ischemia. During a mean 24-month follow-up, 12 stent grafts (21%) occluded. Primary and secondary patency rates were 80% and 90% at 1 year, and 77% and 87% at 2 years of follow-up. Postoperative treatment with clopidogrel proved to be the only significant predictor for success.\nEndovascular repair of a popliteal artery aneurysm is feasible. Changes in the material used and the addition of clopidogrel may improve patency rates.",

The effects of orbital and laminar shear stress on EC morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis were compared.\nECs were exposed to orbital shear stress with an orbital shaker (210 rpm) or laminar shear stress (14 dyne/cm 2) with a parallel plate. Shear stress in the orbital shaker was measured with optical velocimetry. Cell proliferation was assessed with direct counting and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining; apoptosis was assessed with transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining. Cell surface E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule expression were assessed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Akt phosphorylation was assessed with Western blotting.\nOrbital shear stress increased EC proliferation by 29% and 3 [H]thymidine incorporation two-fold compared to 16% and 38% decreases, respectively, in ECs treated with laminar shear stress (P < .0001 and P = .03, analysis of variance). Cells in the periphery of the culture well aligned to the direction of shear stress similar to the shape change seen with laminar shear stress, whereas ECs in the center of the well appeared unaligned similar to ECs not exposed to shear stress. Shear stress at the bottom surface of the culture well was reduced in the center of the well (5 dyne/cm 2) compared to the periphery (11 dyne/cm 2); the Reynolds' number was 2066. ECs were seeded differentially in the center and periphery of the wells. ECs in the center of the well had increased proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduced Akt phosphorylation, increased intercelluar adhesion molecule expression, and reduced E-selectin down-regulation, compared with ECs in the periphery of the well.\nAlthough the orbital shaker does not apply uniform shear stress throughout the culture well, arterial magnitudes of shear stress are present in the periphery of the well. ECs cultured in the center of the well exposed to low magnitudes of orbital shear stress might be a model of the \"activated\" EC phenotype.\nThe perfect in vitro model to study and assess treatments for atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia does not exists. An extensive body of literature describing effects of laminar shear stress on endothelial cells has contributed to our understanding of the interactions between shear stress and blood vessels. Laminar shear stress is atheroprotective, whereas oscillatory or disturbed shear stress correlates with areas of atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. This study describes the orbital shear stress model, its effects on endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and suggests that activation of the intracellular Akt pathway is associated with these differing effects of laminar and orbital shear stress on endothelial cells.",

This study investigates the effects of ginsenoside Rb1, a major constituent of ginseng, on Hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and molecular changes in porcine coronary arteries.\nThe coronary arteries were harvested from pig hearts and cut into 5-mm ring segments, which were then divided into six groups, including control, Hcy alone (50 microM), low-dose (1 microM) or high-dose (10 microM) Rb1 alone, and Hcy plus low-dose or high-dose Rb1. After 24-hour incubation, the rings were analyzed for vasomotor function in response to thromboxane A2 analog U46619, bradykinin, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), respectively. In addition, superoxide anion was assessed by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence analysis. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.\nEndothelium-dependent relaxation (bradykinin) was significantly reduced in rings treated with Hcy alone as compared with the control (49.80% vs 71.77%, n = 8, P < .05), whereas neither high-dose nor low-dose Rb1 alone affected the endothelium-dependent relaxation. The low-dose Rb1-Hcy combined group had a partially improved endothelium-dependent relaxation (54.44%), whereas the high-dose Rb1-Hcy combined group showed a complete recovery of endothelium-dependent relaxation (72.89%). There was no substantial difference in maximal contraction induced by U46619 or endothelium-independent relaxation by SNP among all groups (P > .05). Furthermore, superoxide anion was markedly increased by 137% in the Hcy-treated group as compared with the control, but there were no statistically significant changes from the control in all other groups (P > .05). Lastly, eNOS mRNA and protein levels were substantially reduced in the Hcy-treated group, but not in the Rb1-Hcy combined groups.\nThis is the first study to show that ginsenoside Rb1 can effectively block Hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and superoxide anion production as well as eNOS downregulation in porcine coronary arteries.

    "abstract": "Homocysteine, a risk factor for atherosclerosis, increases intimal hyperplasia after carotid endarterectomy with associated smooth muscle cell proliferation and modulation of cytokines. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr), a glutamate-gated ion channel receptor, is associated with homocysteine-induced cerebrovascular injury; however, the receptor has not been identified in peripheral vascular cells, nor has any interaction with homocysteine been clarified. Our objectives were first, to identify NMDAr in rat carotid artery and rat aorta endothelial cells (RAEC); and second, to determine whether homocysteine activates NMDAr in the endothelium.\nNR1 and NR2A, two NMDAr subunits, were probed in rat carotid arteries by immunohistochemistry. RNA was isolated from RAECs, and expression of all NMDAr subunits (NR1, 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D) were examined by RT-PCR and sequencing. For receptor protein expression, RAEC were incubated with different homocysteine concentrations and incubation times and also were treated with 50 microM homocysteine and/or preincubated with 50 microM dizocilpine MK-801, an NMDAr inhibitor.\nBoth NR1 and NR2A were expressed in rat carotid arteries. All NMDAr subunits were expressed in the RAECs, and there was 92% to 100% similarity compared with rat NMDAr from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank. Homocysteine upregulated NR1 expression and increased cell proliferation. RAEC pretreatment with MK-801 reduced homocysteine-mediated cell proliferation.\nThis study is the first to show that NMDAr exists in the peripheral vasculature, and that homocysteine may act via NMDAr to increase intimal hyperplasia.\nOur objectives included the identification of a homocysteine receptor in the peripheral vasculature. The possible inhibition of a homocysteine receptor to prevent intimal hyperplasia rather than treat established stenosis would make a significant clinical impact. This will open further avenues of study in determining the role of homocysteine in the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) progression and disease resistance are related to mural cellularity; adventitial macrophages and neocapillaries predominate in larger, advanced aneurysms, whereas smaller AAAs have fewer macrophages and retain more medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Expression analysis of mRNA derived from the entire aorta may mask the role that specific cell types play in modulating disease progression. We used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate SMC and macrophage-predominant mural cell populations for gene expression analysis in variable-flow AAA.\nRat AAAs were created via porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) infusion. Aortic flow was increased via femoral arteriovenous fistula creation (HF-AAA) or reduced via unilateral iliac ligation (LF-AAA) in selected cohorts. SMC and macrophage-predominant cell populations were isolated via LCM and analyzed for expression of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and chemokines, cytokines, and proteolytic enzymes via real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nAortic PPE infusion precipitated endothelial cell (EC) denudation, SMC apoptosis, and elastic lamellar degeneration. Increased aortic flow (HF > NF > LF) stimulated restorative EC and SMC proliferation (45.8 +/- 6.6 > 30.5 +/- 2.1 > 21 +/- 3.6 and 212.2 +/- 9.8 > 136.5 +/- 8.9 > 110 +/- 13.5, respectively, for both cell types; P < .05) at 5 days after PPE infusion, while simultaneously reducing medial SMC apoptosis and transmural macrophage infiltration. Expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappab), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage migration inhibitory (MIF), heparin-binding EGF-like factor (HB-EGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) varied between cell types and flow conditions at all time points examined. Gelatinolytic protease expression varied by cell type in response to flow loading (eg, increased in SMCs, decreased in macrophages), consistent with observed patterns of elastolysis and SMC proliferation reported in prior experiments.\nFlow differentially regulates cell-specific AAA gene expression. Whole-organ analysis of AAA tissue lysates obscures important cellular responses to inflammation and flow, and may explain previous seemingly contradictory observations regarding proteolysis and cell proliferation. Cell-type specific expression and functional analyses may substantially clarify the pathophysiology of AAA disease.\nUnderstanding aneurysmal aortic degeneration at the most fundamental level is a critical precursor to the development of next-generation therapies such as drug-eluting endografts and/or medical therapies to limit expansion of preclinical AAA in high-risk or elderly patients. Although animal modeling is necessary to gain insight into the early initiating events of AAA disease, the methods used in such analyses have critical bearing on the conclusions drawn regarding pathogenesis and potential therapeutic derivations. By analyzing cell-type-specific gene expression rather than whole-organ tissue lysates, the precise roles of important mediators such as metalloproteinases can be placed in the appropriate context. Further refinement of these techniques may allow cell-specific therapies to be applied at defined time points in disease progression with improved patient outcome and reduced procedural morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Venous leg ulcers are a major cause of morbidity, economic loss, and decreased quality of life in affected patients. Recently, biomaterials derived from natural tissue sources have been used to stimulate wound closure. One such biomaterial obtained from porcine small-intestine submucosa (SIS) has shown promise as an effective treatment to manage full-thickness wounds. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of SIS wound matrix with compression vs compression alone in healing chronic leg ulcers within 12 weeks.\nThis was a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial. Patients were 120 patients with at least 1 chronic leg ulcer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either weekly topical treatment of SIS plus compression therapy (n = 62) or compression therapy alone (n = 58). Ulcer size was determined at enrollment and weekly throughout the treatment. Healing was assessed weekly for up to 12 weeks. Recurrence after 6 months was recorded. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of ulcers healed in each group at 12 weeks.\nAfter 12 weeks of treatment, 55% of the wounds in the SIS group were healed, as compared with 34% in the standard-care group (P = .0196). None of the healed patients treated with SIS wound matrix and seen for the 6-month follow-up experienced ulcer recurrence.\nThe SIS wound matrix, as an adjunct therapy, significantly improves healing of chronic leg ulcers over compression therapy alone.",

    "abstract": "This clinical, retrospective study is evaluated the effect of epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in the treatment of Buerger's disease.\nThe clinical criteria of Shionoya were used to diagnose 29 patients (22 men, 7 women; mean age 33.7 years) with Buerger's disease. The patients underwent SCS. Complete physical examination and vascular laboratory data were available and recorded for all patients. Questions regarding the improvement of symptoms, in lifestyle, and in physical activities were asked direct interview or by telephone during mean follow-up of 4 years.\nThe regional perfusion index (RPI), the ratio between the foot and chest transcutaneous oxygen pressure at baseline (before SCS treatment) was 0.27 +/- 0.25. Three months after SCS implantation the RPI increased to 0.41 +/- 0.22. During the follow-up period, a sustained improvement in microcirculation was recorded: the RPI at 1-year follow-up was 0.49 +/- 0.34 and at 3-year follow-up was 0.52 +/- 0.21. The most pronounced improvement in the RPI values was found in the subgroup of 13 patients with trophic lesions. In this group, the RPI increased significantly from 0.17 +/- 0.21 to 0.4 +/- 0.18 (P < .023) after a mean follow-up of 5.7 years. Two patients underwent major amputation of the lower target limb. The limb survival rate was 93.1%. During the follow-up period of 4 years, 21 of the 29 patients continued to smoke, and only five patients stopped nicotine exposure.\nWe recorded a significant benefit in the microcirculation, a good limb survival rate, and the absence of new trophic lesions. During the follow-up period, no severe complications related to the implanted devices occurred. Because of the diffuse, distal, segmental nature of the disease, SCS should be considered as an alternative treatment modality in patients with Buerger's disease.",

    "abstract": "African Americans have a much higher risk of major (above- or below-knee) lower extremity amputation and a lower rate of limb-preserving vascular surgery or angioplasty than white patients. This article analyzes two potential pathways for racial disparities: primary amputation, defined as a major amputation performed without any prior attempt at revascularization, and repeat amputation, defined as a major amputation subsequent to a previous through-foot or major amputation.\nRandomly selected medical records were reviewed for 248 African American, 30 Hispanic, and 235 white or other-race patients undergoing above- or below-knee amputation between 1995 and 2003 at three Chicago teaching hospitals. Chronic disease prevalence and severity, preadmission functional status, clinical presentation, and vascular history were used to test the risk-adjusted effect of race and ethnicity on rates of primary and repeat amputation.\nControlling for demographic, functional, chronic disease, and clinical characteristics, African American patients were 1.7 times more likely to have undergone both primary (P = .01) and repeat (P = .03) amputation than white or other-race amputees. Race remained a significant independent risk factor even after controlling for the higher severity of illness, greater disability, and more complex presentation of African American amputees.\nHigher rates of primary and repeat amputation for African American patients at study hospitals, which all have significant vascular surgery capacity and an aggressive policy of limb salvage, suggest that these rates may be even higher at less well equipped institutions. Improving access to primary and preventive care for lower-income patients could reduce amputation rates among African Americans.",

    "abstract": "The presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), even in the absence of overt coronary artery disease (CAD), confers the same relative risk of death from a cardiovascular cause as in patients with a previous cardiovascular event. Current guidelines recommend atherosclerotic risk factor-reduction strategies in PAD patients identical to those in patients with a recent coronary event. The purpose of this study was to determine the status of atherosclerotic risk factor control in patients with PAD.\nWe analyzed the records of patients treated at 2 regional clinics serving 92,940 individuals. Full examination, laboratory, and pharmacy data were available for all patients. Pharmacy data were analyzed to determine prescriptions for beta-blocker therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents. Lipid control was assessed through fasting lipid data. Glycemic control in diabetics was evaluated by using hemoglobin A 1c levels.\nWe administratively identified 2839 patients with a diagnosis of PAD. The exclusion of 1106 patients with a diagnosis of CAD or validated not to have PAD resulted in a cohort of 1733 patients. Of these, 33.1% (574/1733) were currently receiving beta-blockers, 28.9% (500/1733) were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and 31.3% (543/1733) were receiving a statin. Most patients (92%; 1594/1733) had a recent blood pressure recorded. However, 56% (893/1594) had a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher, 45.5% (726/1594) had a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or higher, and 13.6% (217/1594) had a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Screening fasting lipid profiles were found in 62.6% (1085/1733) of patients, 56% (508/912) had a low-density lipoprotein of 100 mg/dL or higher, and 21% (187/912) had a value of more than 130 mg/dL. In patients with diabetes, a hemoglobin A 1c level of 7.0% or higher was found in 54.2% (198/365) of patients.\nDespite national consensus of PAD as a CAD equivalent, patients are currently undertreated with regard to atherosclerotic risk factor modification. Until broader recognition of this disease process exists, vascular surgeons must continue to champion medical as well as surgical treatments for these patients.",

The exclusion of 1106 patients with a diagnosis of CAD or validated not to have PAD resulted in a cohort of 1733 patients. Of these, 33.1% (574/1733) were currently receiving beta-blockers, 28.9% (500/1733) were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and 31.3% (543/1733) were receiving a statin. Most patients (92%; 1594/1733) had a recent blood pressure recorded. However, 56% (893/1594) had a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher, 45.5% (726/1594) had a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or higher, and 13.6% (217/1594) had a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Screening fasting lipid profiles were found in 62.6% (1085/1733) of patients, 56% (508/912) had a low-density lipoprotein of 100 mg/dL or higher, and 21% (187/912) had a value of more than 130 mg/dL.

    "abstract": "Factor V G1691A (Leiden), prothrombin G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutations are considered risk factors for venous thromboembolism. It remains to be characterized whether the presence of these relatively common mutations poses a risk for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Therefore, we intended to test, by conducting a case-control study, the hypothesis that PAD was associated with an increased prevalence of factor V G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, and MTHFR C677T mutations.\nThe study comprised 433 patients admitted for inpatient diagnostics and treatment of PAD in patients with chronic limb ischemia. Patients with acute ischemia or malignancy were excluded. A total of 433 control subjects matched to the patients with PAD in a 1:1 design by sex, age (+/-2 years), and diabetes mellitus status were recruited. Factor V G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, and MTHFR C677T genotypes were assessed by polymerase chain reaction.\nFor the factor V G1691A polymorphism, the genotype frequencies in PAD patients were 92.8% GG (normal homozygotes = wild type) and 7.2% GA (mutant heterozygotes), and in control subjects they were 94.0% GG and 6.0% GA (chi 2 test; P = .493). The distribution of the prothrombin G20210A genotypes was 96.3% GG (normal homozygotes = wild type) and 3.7% GA (mutant heterozygotes) in PAD patients and was 97.2% GG and 2.8% GA in control subjects (chi 2 test; P = .442). Genotype frequencies for the MTHFR C677T polymorphism were 47.8% CC (normal homozygotes = wild type), 43.4% CT (mutant heterozygotes), and 8.8% TT (mutant homozygotes) in PAD patients, compared with 47.1% CC, 44.1% CT, and 8.8% TT in control subjects (chi 2 test; P = .977). Accordingly, as determined by logistic regression analysis, no significant odds ratios for heterozygous or homozygous genotypes of the three polymorphisms could be observed.\nPAD was not associated with an increased prevalence of factor V G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, and MTHFR C677T mutations in the population studied. Thus, there is no indication that of one of these mutations may be a risk factor for chronic limb ischemia. However, the role of these mutations in acute limb ischemia remains to be clarified.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the association between skeletal muscle and exercise intolerance in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we assessed treadmill-walking performance and gastrocnemius muscle phenotype in healthy control subjects and in patients with PAD. We hypothesized that gastrocnemius muscle characteristics would be altered in PAD compared with control subjects and that exercise tolerance in patients PAD would be related to muscle phenotype.\nSixteen patients with PAD and intermittent claudication and 13 healthy controls of the same age participated. Each subject completed a graded treadmill-walking test and underwent a resting muscle biopsy. Muscle biopsy samples were obtained from the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the most ischemic limb in PAD and a limb chosen at random in controls. Samples were analyzed for fiber type and cross-sectional area, capillary-to-fiber ratio, the number of capillaries in contact with each fiber type, and the optical density of glycogen within each fiber by using histochemical procedures. Total muscle glycogen content was determined biochemically.\nExercise capacity measured on the incremental walking test in the PAD group was only 30% to 40% of that observed in controls. The PAD group had a lower proportion of type I muscle fibers (P < .05), fewer capillaries per muscle fiber (P < .05), and tended to have smaller fiber areas (P = .08). The relative area of type I fibers, the capillary-to-fiber ratio, capillary contacts with type I and IIa fibers, and the optical density of glycogen in type I fibers were all positively correlated with exercise tolerance in the PAD group (P < .05) but not controls.\nThese data suggest that muscle phenotype is altered in PAD and that such alterations are associated with the exercise intolerance in these patients. In light of these findings, therapies such as resistance training or electrical stimulation that target skeletal muscle in PAD may prove beneficial, and further investigation of such therapies is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our pilot study was to determine the usefulness of rapid, high-pressure, intermittent pneumatic calf and foot compression (IPCFC) in patients with stable intermittent claudication, with reference to the end points of improvement in initial claudication distance (ICD) (distance at which patient feels pain or discomfort in the legs), and improvement in absolute claudication distance (ACD) (distance at which patient stops walking because the pain or discomfort becomes severe).\nThirty male patients presenting with stable, intermittent claudication (ACD between 50 and 150 meters on treadmill testing at 3.8 km/h, 10 degrees gradient) were recruited into this pilot study from a single center. Fifteen patients were randomized to treatment with IPCFC (applied for 1 hour twice daily in the sitting position) and were also advised to have daily exercise, and 15 patients served as controls, who were advised exercise alone. All patients received aspirin and had resting and postexercise ankle/brachial index (ABI) measured at enrollment along with ICD and ACD on treadmill testing (3.8 km/h, 10 degrees gradient). The mean age, baseline ICD, and ACD of the treatment and control groups were 70.4 +/- 7 years and 70.7 +/- 9 years, 55.8 +/- 15 meters and 68.4 +/- 17 meters, and 86.7 +/- 19 meters and 103.9 +/- 27 meters, respectively. Both groups were equally matched for risk factors, including smoking, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. IPCFC was applied. The study protocol included follow-up visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 months with the ABI, ICD and ACD being measured at every visit.\nThe percent change from baseline for ICD and ACD for each patient visit and the mean +/- standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), and median were calculated for the control and treatment groups. The percent change from baseline measurements (mean +/- SD) for ICD and ACD in the control group at 4, 6, and 12 months were 2.2 +/- 18 and 2.3 +/- 18, 2.9 +/- 17 and 5.2 +/- 20, and 3.6 +/- 18 and 5.8 +/- 20, respectively. In contrast, the changes in ICD and ACD at 4, 6, and 12 months in the treatment group were 137.1 +/- 128 (P < .01) and 84.3 +/- 82 (P < .01), 140.6 +/- 127 (P < .01) and 96.4 +/- 106 (P = .01), and 150.8 +/- 124 (P <0.01) and 101.2 +/- 104 (P <0.01), respectively. Although the ABI showed a slight increase in the treatment group, these differences were not statistically significant.\nThe results of this pilot study show that IPCFC improves walking distance in patients with stable intermittent claudication. A significant increase in ICD and ACD was seen at 4 and 6 months of treatment, respectively, and the improvement was sustained at 1 year. The combination of IPCFC with other treatment such as risk-factor modification and daily exercise may prove useful in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. It may be a useful first line of therapy in patients with disabling claudication who are unfit for major reconstructive surgery. Improved walking on long-term follow-up and experience from different centers may establish a role for this treatment modality in the future.",

    "abstract": "The carotid artery is frequently patched after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to minimize the risks of early postoperative thrombosis and late recurrent stenosis. The small intestinal submucosa (SIS) patch is a biologic vascular patch derived from porcine small intestine. It is composed primarily of cell-free collagen and other extracellular matrix constituents that act as a scaffold for host cell deposition.\nIn May 2001, we began an investigational trial of SIS patches in 76 patients undergoing patch angioplasty of the carotid artery after CEA.\nNo adverse events related to the patches were observed in the first 69 patients implanted with an SIS patch. However, in late 2002, seven patients were found to have asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms (PSA) by duplex imaging < or =10 weeks after their CEAs. The trial was immediately suspended. The PSAs were treated by surgical resection with vein grafting in two patients and placement of covered endoluminal stents in four patients. One patient is being followed as the PSA is small and has remained stable. Histopathologic examination of the SIS patch explanted from one of the surgically treated patients demonstrated the presence of actin-positive myofibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. Extensive mechanical testing of the SIS material from the two material lots associated with PSAs demonstrated thinner and more variable physical characteristics compared with control device lots.\nBiologic patches that undergo active remodeling in the carotid artery require greater thickness than was anticipated to decrease wall stress and suture hole elongation. Patches exceeding this minimum thickness will be required to ensure the safety of new SIS patch designs for vascular operations.",

However, in late 2002, seven patients were found to have asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms (PSA) by duplex imaging < or =10 weeks after their CEAs. The trial was immediately suspended. The PSAs were treated by surgical resection with vein grafting in two patients and placement of covered endoluminal stents in four patients. One patient is being followed as the PSA is small and has remained stable. Histopathologic examination of the SIS patch explanted from one of the surgically treated patients demonstrated the presence of actin-positive myofibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. Extensive mechanical testing of the SIS material from the two material lots associated with PSAs demonstrated thinner and more variable physical characteristics compared with control device lots.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) might improve cognitive functioning, but studies thus far have produced mixed results. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of CEA on cognitive functions in a methodologically more strict design, first by testing the presumption of preoperative cognitive impairment and second through a better control for the possible influence of the nonspecific effects of practice and surgery.\nPreoperative performance on a neuropsychologic test battery of 56 patients with severe occlusive disease of the carotid artery but without history of major stroke was compared with the performance of 46 healthy control subjects and 23 patients before endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery (remote endarterectomy). The degree of cognitive change in the 2 patient groups was compared at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. We assessed mood to control for possible momentary affective influences on cognition.\nBefore CEA, patients showed reduced functioning compared with that seen in healthy control subjects in terms of attention, verbal and visual memory, planning of motor behavior, psychomotor skills, and executive function. Performance of patients before remote endarterectomy was reduced as well. Improvements in several cognitive functions were observed after both types of surgical interventions and were attributed to psychologic relief from uncomplicated surgery and to practice.\nNo specific restorative effect of CEA on cognitive functioning was observed. The preoperative impairment in several cognitive domains might be caused by factors that patients with various types of vascular disease might have in common, such as small-vessel disease or other undetected abnormalities within the brain.",

    "abstract": "When compared with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), percutaneous carotid angioplasty with stent replacement (CAS) is a less invasive technique in the treatment of carotid stenosis. However, periprocedural hemodynamic instability still remains a challenge. This instability might lead to myocardial damage, which is now measured accurately by using cardiac troponin I (CTnI).\nThis study was designed to compare the periprocedural variation of CTnI in 150 consecutive patients scheduled to undergo CEA (n = 75) or CAS (n = 75). The levels of CTnI were measured until the third postoperative day in all patients. Short-term (1 month) and long-term (up to 5 years) postoperative cardiac outcome were assessed by means of chart review, regular follow-ups, and telephone calls.\nThere was not any statistically significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the demographic characteristics and preprocedural medical status. The incidence of increase of CTnI (>0.5 ng/mL) was significantly higher in the CEA group (13%) compared with that in the CAS group (1%; P = .001). During the acute postprocedural period, the CAS group was significantly more prone to hypotension, requiring vasopressor therapy, whereas the CEA group had more hypertension, necessitating hypotensive medications (P < .001). At 5 years, the overall incidence of major cardiac complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction and death related to cardiac origin) was significantly more frequent in the CEA group (20% vs 5%, P < .01).\nThe results of our study suggest that CAS yielded less myocardial damage in the short and long term when compared with CEA. Larger randomized multicenter trials with long-term outcomes are necessary to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the gold standard for treatment of carotid stenosis. With inevitable comparisons of catheter-based therapy to all aspects of CEA, this study of a large contemporary series was undertaken to evaluate the determinants of anatomic durability of CEA.\nDuring the interval (1989 through 1999), 2,127 primary, isolated CEAs with selective patching (50.2%) were performed in 1,853 patients (61.8% male, 36.1% symptomatic). End points included patient longevity and perioperative morbidity as well as evidence of CEA anatomic durability as defined by duplex evaluation: CEA restenosis (moderate, >50%, or greater recurrent stenosis), which included CEA anatomic failure (severe, >70%, restenosis/carotid occlusion). The incidence of CEA recurrent stenosis was temporally assessed early (<2 years) and late (>2 years) after operation. Clinical and surgical variables potentially associated with the study endpoints were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods.\nThe perioperative stroke and death rate was 1.4% and the 2-year and 10-year survival was 88.1% and 44.9%, respectively. Anatomic failure after CEA developed in 3.9% at 2 years and in 8.5% at 5 years; only 3.2% of CEA patients underwent reoperation during a mean follow-up of 73.4 months. Early (<2 years) analysis revealed 12.2% restenosis, whereas late (>2 years) results identified 9.8% progression of carotid stenosis and a 5.8% rate of anatomic failure. Multivariate analysis determined elevated creatinine (odds ratio [OR], 1.719, P < .001) and female gender (OR, 1.564; P < .02) correlated with early restenosis. Surgical patch closure and lipid-lowering drugs were protective for both early restenosis, with ORs of 0.543 (P < .0.001) and 0.601 (P < .007) and early anatomic failure ORs of 0.469 (P < .02) and 0.517 (P < .03), respectively. Although only elevated serum cholesterol (OR, 1.009; P < .03) correlated with late anatomic failure, only lipid-lowering drugs were protective for both late freedom from progression of disease (OR, 0.202; P < .0002) or late CEA anatomic failure (OR, 0.128; P < .0003).\nThe association of female gender and elevated cholesterol with recurrent carotid stenosis is confirmed, elevated creatinine is introduced as a risk factor, and surgical patch repair is protective for early CEA recurrent carotid stenosis. The unique findings of the significant, beneficial effects of lipid-lowering drugs on both early and late CEA anatomic durability and patient survival indicate that such therapy should be instituted in most patients after CEA.",

Devices inserted were as follows: Vanguard (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass; n = 7), Excluder (W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz; n = 25), Talent (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif; n = 2), and Zenith (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind; n = 3). Except for the adjunct postimplantation computed tomographic scanning, the imaging follow-up was the same as for nonruptured AAAs.\nThe mean follow-up period was 24 months (range, 1-59) months. Thirty-day mortality was 10.8%. Three patients died during the follow-up of non-AAA-related causes. One patient was converted early for presumed renal overstenting. The late conversion rate was 9% because of stent graft migration (n = 2) or infection (n = 1). Freedom from endoleak was 57% +/- 8.5% and 48.8% +/- 9% at 2 and 4 years, respectively. Seventeen secondary interventions were performed during the follow-up period, 41% of these within 1 month of stent graft placement. Endoleaks, primary or secondary, were responsible for 58.8% of these interventions. The cumulative risk of a secondary intervention was 35.3% +/- 9% at 2 years and 44.6% +/- 11% at 3 years. Aneurysmal sac shrinkage was observed in 30.8% +/- 9.1% and sac enlargement was observed in 15.3% +/- 10.8% at 2 years.\nEndoluminal devices are able to convert the acute life-threatening situation of ruptured AAA to a controlled situation that results in good patient survival at midterm follow-up.",

One patient was converted early for presumed renal overstenting. The late conversion rate was 9% because of stent graft migration (n = 2) or infection (n = 1). Freedom from endoleak was 57% +/- 8.5% and 48.8% +/- 9% at 2 and 4 years, respectively. Seventeen secondary interventions were performed during the follow-up period, 41% of these within 1 month of stent graft placement. Endoleaks, primary or secondary, were responsible for 58.8% of these interventions. The cumulative risk of a secondary intervention was 35.3% +/- 9% at 2 years and 44.6% +/- 11% at 3 years.

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in men.\nA systematic review of the literature was conducted for different screening strategies in terms of age (60, 65, or 70 years) and risk profiles (all men or specific high-risk groups) of the screened population, and rescreening after 5 or 10 years. These data were analyzed in a Markov simulation cohort model.\nThe cost per life year gained for different screening strategies ranged from US 8,309 dollars to US 14,084 dollars and was estimated at US 10,474 dollars when 65-year-old men were screened once. Screening 60-year-old men was equally cost-effective, with the advantage of more life years gained. We demonstrated a trade-off between high prevalence of AAA and lower life expectancy, eliminating the expected benefits of screening high-risk groups such as smokers (US 10,695 dollars) or cardiovascular patients (US 10,392 dollars). Assuming general population utility resulted in a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of US 13,900 dollars, whereas a hypothetical 5% reduction in utility among men with a screening-detected AAA raised the cost per QALY gained to US 75,100 dollars.\nThis Markov model, which was based on a systematic review of the literature, supplied information on the estimated cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies. Screening men for AAA may be cost-effective in the long-term. Different screening strategies and quality-of-life effects related to screening for AAA need to be evaluated in future clinical studies.",

The available evidence supports the provision of an antiplatelet agent, a statin, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for cardiovascular protection in these patients. When used together, these approaches are expected to produce a cumulative relative risk reduction of approximately 80%. Given the high baseline risk of this population and the effectiveness of these interventions, a combination of multiple drug therapies, in concert with aggressive lifestyle change and revascularization (where appropriate), can substantially reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral arterial disease.",

We present our experience with two patients treated with a combination of coil embolization and laparoscopic occlusion of the splenic artery achieved by developing a retropancreatic plane and applying clips immediately distal to the aneurysm.

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia is a vascular remodelling process that occurs after a vascular injury. The mechanisms involved in intimal hyperplasia are proliferation, dedifferentiation, and migration of medial smooth muscle cells towards the subintimal space. We postulated that gap junctions, which coordinate physiologic processes such as cell growth and differentiation, might participate in the development of intimal hyperplasia. Connexin43 (Cx43) expression levels may be altered in intimal hyperplasia, and we therefore evaluated the regulated expression of Cx43 in human saphenous veins in culture in the presence or not of fluvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity.\nSegments of harvested human saphenous veins, obtained at the time of bypass graft, were opened longitudinally with the luminal surface uppermost and maintained in culture for 14 days. Vein fragments were then processed for histologic examination, neointimal thickness measurements, immunocytochemistry, RNA, and proteins analysis.\nOf the four connexins (Cx37, 40, 43, and 45), we focused on Cx43 and Cx40, which we found by real-time polymerase chain reaction to be expressed in the saphenous vein because they are the predominant connexins expressed by smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. After 14 days of culture, histomorphometric analysis showed a significant increase in the intimal thickness as observed during the process of intimal hyperplasia. A time-course analysis revealed a progressive upregulation of Cx43 to reach a maximal increase of sixfold to eightfold at both transcript and protein levels after 14 days in culture. In contrast, the expression of Cx40, abundantly expressed in the endothelial cells, was not altered. Immunofluorescence showed a large increase in Cx43 within smooth muscle cell membranes of the media layer. The development of intimal hyperplasia in vitro was decreased in presence of fluvastatin and was associated with reduced Cx43 expression.\nThese data show that Cx43 is increased in vitro during the process of intimal hyperplasia and that fluvastatin could prevent this induction, supporting a critical role for Cx43-mediated gap-junctional communication in the human vein during the development of intimal hyperplasia.\nStenosis due to intimal hyperplasia is the most common cause of failure of venous bypass grafts. To better understand the development of intimal hyperplasia, we used an ex vivo organ culture model to study saphenous veins harvested from patients undergoing a lower limb bypass surgery. In this model, the morphologic and functional integrity of the vessel wall is maintained and significant intimal hyperplasia development occurs after 14 days in culture. We have postulated that gap junctions, which coordinate physiologic processes such as cell growth and differentiation, may participate in the development of intimal hyperplasia. Indeed, intimal hyperplasia consists of proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells into the subendothelial space. Intercellular communication is responsible for the direct transfer of ions and small molecules from one cell to the other through gap-junction channels found at cell-cell appositions. No study to date has evaluated whether gap junctional communication is involved in the process of intimal hyperplasia in humans. This assertion was investigated by using the aforementioned organ culture model of intimal hyperplasia in human saphenous veins, and our data support a critical role for Cx43-mediated gap junctional communication in human vein during the development of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "results": "Of the four connexins (Cx37, 40, 43, and 45), we focused on Cx43 and Cx40, which we found by real-time polymerase chain reaction to be expressed in the saphenous vein because they are the predominant connexins expressed by smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. After 14 days of culture, histomorphometric analysis showed a significant increase in the intimal thickness as observed during the process of intimal hyperplasia. A time-course analysis revealed a progressive upregulation of Cx43 to reach a maximal increase of sixfold to eightfold at both transcript and protein levels after 14 days in culture. In contrast, the expression of Cx40, abundantly expressed in the endothelial cells, was not altered. Immunofluorescence showed a large increase in Cx43 within smooth muscle cell membranes of the media layer. The development of intimal hyperplasia in vitro was decreased in presence of fluvastatin and was associated with reduced Cx43 expression.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are characterized by histologic signs of chronic inflammation, destructive remodeling of extracellular matrix, and depletion of vascular smooth muscle cells. We investigated the process of extracellular matrix remodeling by performing a genetic association study with polymorphisms in the genes for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and structural extracellular matrix molecules in AAA. Our hypothesis was that genetic variations in one or more of these genes contribute to greater or lesser activity of these gene products, and thereby contribute to susceptibility for developing AAAs.\nDNA samples from 812 unrelated white subject (AAA, n = 387; controls, n = 425) were genotyped for 14 polymorphisms in 13 different candidate genes: MMP1(nt-1607), MMP2(nt-955), MMP3(nt-1612), MMP9(nt-1562), MMP10(nt+180), MMP12(nt-82), MMP13(nt-77), TIMP1(nt+434), TIMP1(rs2070584), TIMP2(rs2009196), TIMP3(nt-1296), TGFB1(nt-509), ELN(nt+422), and COL3A1(nt+581). Odds ratios and P values adjusted for gender and country of origin using logistic regression and stratified by family history of AAA were calculated to test for association between genotype and disease status. Haplotype analysis was carried out for the two TIMP1 polymorphisms in male subjects.\nAnalyses with one polymorphism per test without interactions showed an association with the two TIMP1 gene polymorphisms (nt+434, P = .0047; rs2070584, P = .015) in male subjects without a family history of AAA. The association remained significant when analyzing TIMP1 haplotypes (chi 2 P = .014 and empirical P = .009). In addition, we found a significant interaction between the polymorphism and gender for MMP10 ( P = .037) in cases without a family history of AAA, as well as between the polymorphism and country of origin for ELN ( P = .0169) and TIMP3 ( P = .0023) in cases with a family history of AAA.\nThese findings suggest that genetic variations in TIMP1, TIMP3, MMP10, and ELN genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of AAAs. Further work is needed to confirm the findings in an independent set of samples and to study the functional role of these variants in AAA. It is noteworthy that contrary to a previous study, we did not find an association between the MMP9 (nt-1562) polymorphism and AAA, suggesting genetic heterogeneity of the disease.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are an important cardiovascular disease, but the genetic and environmental risk factors, which contribute to individual's risk to develop an aneurysm, are poorly understood. Histologically, AAAs are characterized by signs of chronic inflammation, destructive remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and depletion of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that genes involved in these events could harbor changes that make individuals more susceptible to developing aneurysms. This study identified significant genetic associations between DNA sequence changes in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), TIMP3, matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10) and elastin (ELN) genes, and AAA. The results will require confirmation using an independent set of samples. After replication it is possible that these sequence changes in combination with other risk factors could be used in the future to identify individuals who are at increased risk for developing an AAA.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and histological response of laparoscopic external aortic wrap implantation in conjunction with an endovascular stent/stent-graft placement in the infrarenal aorta in a porcine model.\nSeven swine underwent laparoscopic retroperitoneal placement of a custom-made Dacron fabric wrap placed around the infrarenal aorta to create a landing zone for an endovascularly placed aortic stent/stent-graft.\nTechnical success was achieved in all animals without any major complications. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 weeks. At necropsy, the external wraps were well incorporated into the adventitia, and the stents/stent-grafts were well incorporated into the intima.

This, in turn, could improve eligibility for endovascular aneurysm repair and prevent or treat type I endoleak and graft migration.

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that atheroemboli released during renal angioplasty could be responsible for the modest functional result of renal angioplasty even after anatomic reduction of renal artery stenosis. To test this hypothesis, we enumerated and sized fragments released during ex vivo angioplasty and stenting of human renal artery atherosclerotic specimens removed during aortorenal endarterectomy.\nThirty-three intact aortorenal atheroma specimens (16 pairs with adjacent aortic atheroma and one specimen with a single renal artery orifice) were removed from 17 patients with renal artery occlusive disease who underwent renal artery endarterectomy. specimens. Endarterectomy specimens were removed with a ring of aortic plaque and \"fitted\" with a polytetrafluoroethylene \"adventitia\". Ex vivo angioplasty was technically successful in 31 of the 33 specimens and was performed by using a 0.018-inch guidewire and 3.0-mm and 5.0-mm angioplasty balloons inflated for 30 seconds at 15 atmospheres pressure. Stenting was performed with either a 5-mm or 6-mm self-expanding Wallstent. Each artery was flushed with 20 mL of saline after guidewire placement, each angioplasty, and stent placement. The effluent was collected for analysis for counting with either a microscope (size >100 microm) or a Coulter counter (size <100 microm). The number and size of embolic fragments in the effluent collected after each manipulation was recorded.\nEach manipulation of the specimens, including simply advancing the guidewire through the atherosclerotic lesion, released thousands of fragments. The numbers of fragments in each size category increased with decreasing particle size. Positioning and deploying the Wallstent released an additional bolus of fragments similar to that released after balloon angioplasty.\nEx vivo renal angioplasty releases thousands of atherosclerotic fragments of sufficient size to create vascular occlusions and initiate significant renal parenchymal damage. The results of renal angioplasty procedures could be improved by placing distal protection devices to prevent atheroembolization.\nAthero-emboli produce a local arteritis in the kidney and could cause substantial damage to the renal parenchyma. This report explores the quantity of athero-emboli released during ex vivo angioplasty and stenting of renal atheroma specimens. The number of emboli found in this ex vivo study suggest that the use of protection devices may be advisable to protect the end organ, as done with angioplasty of the carotid artery. Of necessity, this was an ex vivo study and direct application to the clinical setting will need further study. Fortunately, multi-center trials examining the value of protection devices are currently in progress.",

Spinal or local, but not tumescent, anesthesia was used. Twenty-nine specimens (3 to 5 cm long) of 24 proximal greater saphenous and five anterior accessory saphenous veins were excised and studied by light microscopy for diameter and thickness of the venous wall, extent of injury into the intima, media, and adventitia, as well as penetration of thermal damage.\nThe histologic evaluation showed thermal injury to the intima in all specimens and full-thickness intimal injury in 22 specimens (75%); the average penetration of thermal injury in 29 specimens was 194.40 microm (range, 10 to 900 microm; 14.61% of the mean wall thickness); complete intimal circumference injury occurred in 8 specimen veins <10 mm in diameter (27.5%), full thickness damage in 6 (20.7%), and perforation in 2 (6.9%).\nSaphenous ablation using 808-nm laser by variable retraction speed, combined with saphenofemoral interruption, leads to sufficient vein wall injury to assure venous occlusion. Full thickness thermal injury or perforation is infrequent. Optimal results can be obtained in veins <10 mm in diameter.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound scanning is used to detect velocity increases indicative of a bypass stenosis. Subsequent examinations have shown regression of some stenotic lesions. This study examined hemodynamic changes that coincided with stenosis regression.\nDuplex ultrasound scans were used to record the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and volume flow from proximal and distal segments of infrainguinal bypasses. Valve remnants or other image defects were also noted. The PSV ratio (Vr) was calculated as the PSV at a stenosis divided by the PSV proximal to the lesion. A stenosis was defined as Vr >/=2.0.\nAn initial ultrasound scan performed 31 +/- 6 days after surgery revealed a stenosis in 68 of 565 bypasses. In six bypasses, the increased PSV (272 +/- 61 cm/s) and Vr (3.4 +/- 1.3) were sustained during the follow-up period of 8 +/- 3 months. In 27 bypasses with a PSV of 335 +/- 63 cm/s and a Vr of 4.0 +/- 1.6, the stenosis was repaired. In 35 bypasses with a PSV of 261 +/- 82 cm/s and Vr of 3.2 +/- 1.2, stenosis regression occurred with no increases in PSV observed on later scans. In this group, proximal bypass flow decreased during the follow-up interval from 247 +/- 130 mL/min to 151 +/- 135 mL/min and distal flow from 180 +/- 102 mL/min to 103 +/- 54 mL/min ( P < .05, paired t test). Ultrasound image abnormalities were noted in 4 bypasses (67%) with persistent stenoses, 14 with repaired stenoses (52%), and 10 with resolved stenoses (29%).\nThese data indicate early postoperative hyperemia is present in bypasses, demonstrating focal velocity increases. Such velocity increases may be the result of the bypass conduit acting as a flow-limiting lesion until the hyperemia subsides. As the blood flow decreases so does the PSV, giving the appearance of stenosis regression.",

    "abstract": "In this report we present a novel procedure that uses an arterioarterial prosthetic loop (AAPL) with the proximal axillary or the femoral artery as a vascular access for hemodialysis in patients who have inadequate vascular conditions for creating an arteriovenous fistula or graft.\nBetween April 1996 and September 2004, 34 patients received 36 AAPLs as vascular access, either as an axillary chest loop (n = 31) or as a femoral loop (n = 5). In this procedure the artery is ligated between the anastomoses to direct flow through the AAPL. Data from all patients undergoing the procedure were prospectively collected.\nThe indication for an AAPL was the unsuitability of large deep veins in 64%, steal syndrome in 11%, the combination of only a suitable femoral vein and severe peripheral arterial disease in 22%, and congestive heart failure in 3%. All AAPLs were cannulated 18 +/- 4 days postoperatively. Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 1 to 83). Primary patency was 73% and secondary patency was 96% at 1 year; these rates at 3 years were 54% and 87%, respectively. The rate of all interventions for the maintenance of AAPL function was 0.47 procedures per patient year. Four grafts were abandoned. More than 11,000 hemodialyses with proven efficiency were performed.\nThe AAPL is an unusual but useful and easy-to-perform alternative procedure to create vascular access for hemodialysis. It can provide survival for strictly selected patients in whom conventional vascular access is not possible. The axillary chest AAPL is preferred.",

    "abstract": "Increasing use of primary arteriovenous fistulae (pAVFs) is a desired goal in hemodialysis patients (National Kidney Foundation /Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative guidelines). However, in many instances, pAVFs fail to adequately mature due to ill-defined mechanisms. We therefore investigated pAVFs with color duplex ultrasound (CDU) surveillance 4 to 12 weeks postoperatively to identify hemodynamically significant abnormalities that may contribute to pAVF failure.\nFrom March 2001 to October 2003, 54 upper extremity pAVFs were subjected to CDU assessment before access. A peak systolic velocity ratio (SVR) of >/=2:1 was used to detect >/=50% stenosis involving arterial inflow and venous outflow, whereas an SVR of >/=3:1 was used to detect >/=50% anastomotic stenosis. CDU findings were compared with preoperative vein mapping and postoperative fistulography when available.\nOf 54 pAVFs, there were 23 brachiocephalic, 14 radiocephalic, and 17 basilic vein transpositions. By CDU surveillance, 11 (20%) were occluded and 14 (26%) were negative. Twenty-nine (54%) pAVFs had 38 hemodynamically significant CDU abnormalities. These included 16 (42%) venous outflow, 13 (34%) anastomotic, and 2 (5%) inflow stenoses. In seven (18%), branch steal with reduced flow was found. In 35 of 54 (65%) pAVFs, preoperative vein mapping was available and demonstrated adequate vein size (>/=3 mm) and outflow in 86% of cases. Twenty-one fistulograms (38%) were available for verifying the CDU abnormalities. In each fistulogram, the arterial inflow, anastomosis, and venous outflow were compared with the CDU findings (63 segments). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CDU in detecting pAVF stenoses >/=50% were 93%, 94%, was 97%, respectively.\nBefore initiation of hemodialysis, an unexpectedly high prevalence of critical stenoses was found in patent pAVFs using CDU surveillance. These de novo stenoses appear to develop rapidly after arterialization of the upper extremity superficial veins and can be reliably detected by CDU surveillance. Turbulent flow conditions in pAVFs may play a role in inducing progressive vein wall and valve leaflet intimal thickening, although stenoses may be due to venous abnormalities that predate AVF placement. Routine CDU surveillance of pAVFs should be considered to identify and correct flow-limiting stenoses that may compromise pAVF long-term patency and use.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive tests are required to detect (in both male and female subjects and side by side) arteries toward the hypogastric circulation that are likely to present significant lesions as a cause of buttock claudication.\nWe compared the accuracy of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TCP o 2 ) on both buttocks during walking tests to detect lesions on the arteries toward the hypogastric circulation. NIRS was considered abnormal if recovery time to pre-exercise values was greater than 240 seconds for tissue oxygen saturation (absent data being coded 0), and TCP o 2 was coded abnormal if the minimal value of buttock changes minus chest changes was lower than -15 mm Hg. The study was conducted in a university hospital; there were 30 ambulatory patients with stage 2 claudication of the Fontaine classification.\nAngiography showed 36 abnormal (stenosis > 75%) and 24 normal arterial axes toward the buttocks circulation. NIRS and TCP o 2 provided respectively 55% (range, 41.6% to 67.9%) and 82% (range, 69.6% to 90.5%) accuracy (95% confidence interval) to predict the presence of arteriographically proven lesions; P < .05.\nUsing available cut-off points proposed in the literature, NIRS showed a lower diagnostic accuracy than TCP o 2 for the prediction of lesions on the arterial tree to the hypogastric circulation. NIRS is a recent technique as compared with TCP o 2 , and its diagnostic accuracy might improve in the future. Currently, one should carefully weigh the advantages and limits of NIRS and TCP o 2 when a choice is to be made between them to monitor exercise-induced changes resulting from lower limb arterial disease at the proximal level.",

Patients were considered poor surgical candidates because of absent distal target vessels (31 limbs), severe comorbid conditions (36 limbs), or lack of an autologous vein for distal bypass (9 limbs). Limb salvage was defined as preservation of a functional foot without the need for a prosthesis. Technical success was defined as the ability to percutaneously recanalize the arterial segment with less than 30% residual stenosis. Clinical success was healing of ulcers or minor amputation sites, resolving rest pain, or avoiding a major amputation. Successful technical and clinical outcomes were correlated with patient demographics, clinical presentation, and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus arterial lesion characteristics by using the Fisher exact test.\nSeventy-six limbs were treated for rest pain (n = 12), gangrene (n = 22), or nonhealing ulcers (n = 42). There were 40 men and 27 women. The mean age was 70 years (range, 36-94 years). Lesions were located in tibial (n = 55), popliteal (n = 6), and superficial femoral (n = 15) arteries. Arterial recanalization and limb salvage was achieved in 64 (83.5%) limbs. Technical failure (n = 12) correlated with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions ( P = .009) and the presence of occlusion ( P = .027). Clinical failure (major amputation, n = 12) correlated with the presence of gangrene ( P = .032) or the combination of diabetes, arterial occlusion, and gangrene ( P = .018). The single variables of age, sex, diabetes, and renal failure did not adversely affect outcomes. There was one mortality (myocardial infarction), and there were two major morbidities (femoral artery pseudoaneurysm and sepsis).\nPeripheral arterial angioplasty should be considered as an alternative to primary amputation in selected patients with CLI who are poor candidates for traditional surgical bypass.",

Primary patency and survival were estimated by product-limit methods.\nThirty-four RAs among 32 kidneys were repaired. Bilateral renal RA disease to a solitary kidney was present in nine patients. RA lesions included dysplasia (44%), RA hypoplasia (20%), midaortic syndrome (12%), RA aneurysm (12%), dissection (8%), and arteritis (4%). All patients had severe hypertension (>95 th percentile systolic or diastolic pressure adjusted for gender, age, and height). RA repair comprised 25 bypasses (73%) consisting of 28% saphenous vein, 60% hypogastric artery, and 12% polytetrafluoroethylene; 2 patch angioplasties (6%), and 7 reimplantations (21%). Branch RA exposure was required in 28 kidneys (88%), and branch reconstruction was required in 61%. Warm in situ repair was used in 53%, in situ cold perfusion in 24%, and ex vivo cold perfusion in 23%. Of six bilateral RA repairs, one was staged and two patients are awaiting a staged repair. Combined aortic reconstruction was required in three patients. No unplanned nephrectomy was performed. There were no perioperative deaths. Hypertension was cured in 36%, improved in 56%, and failed in 8% at mean follow-up of 46.4 +/- 7.8 months. The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate increased from 82.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 preoperatively to 98.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 postoperatively. The postoperative patency of 30 RA reconstructions was evaluated by angiography, RDS scanning, or both. At mean follow-up of 32.8 months (median, 21.2 months), primary RA patency was 91%. No failures were observed after 2 months follow-up. Estimated survival was 100% at 60 months, with one death 9 years after surgery.\nRenovascular hypertension in children and adolescents was caused by a heterogeneous group of lesions. All patients had RA repair, with arterial autografts in most of the RA bypasses. Cold perfusion preservation was used in half of the complex branch RA repairs. These strategies provided 91% primary patency at mean follow-up of 32.8 months, with beneficial blood pressure response in 92%. Surgical repair of clinically significant renovascular disease in children and adolescents is supported by these results.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound is widely used for the diagnosis of internal carotid artery stenosis. Standard duplex ultrasound criteria for the grading of internal carotid artery stenosis do not exist; thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relation between the degree of internal carotid artery stenosis by duplex ultrasound criteria and degree of stenosis by angiography.\nData were gathered from Medline from January 1966 to January 2003, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, ACP Journal Club, UpToDate, reference lists, and authors' files. Inclusion criteria were the comparison of color duplex ultrasound results with angiography by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method; peer-reviewed publications, and >/=10 adults.\nVariables extracted included internal carotid artery peak systolic velocity, internal carotid artery end diastolic velocity, internal carotid artery/common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio, sensitivity and specificity of duplex ultrasound scanning for internal carotid artery stenosis by angiography. The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria were used to assess study quality. Sensitivity and specificity for duplex ultrasound criteria were combined as weighted means by using a random effects model. The threshold of peak systolic velocity >/=130 cm/s is associated with sensitivity of 98% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 97% to 100%) and specificity of 88% (95% CI, 76% to 100%) in the identification of angiographic stenosis of >/=50%. For the diagnosis of angiographic stenosis of >/=70%, a peak systolic velocity >/=200 cm/s has a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI, 84% to 94%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI, 88% to 97%). For each duplex ultrasound threshold, measurement properties vary widely between laboratories, and the magnitude of the variation is clinically important. The heterogeneity observed in the measurement properties of duplex ultrasound may be caused by differences in patients, study design, equipment, techniques or training.\nClinicians need to be aware of the limitations of duplex ultrasound scanning when making management decisions.",

    "abstract": "We compared the physiologic effect of selective atropine administration for bradycardia with routine prophylactic administration, before balloon inflation, during carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). We also compared the incidence of procedural bradycardia and hypotension for CAS in patients with primary stenosis vs those with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nA total of 86 patients were treated with CAS at 3 institutions. Complete periprocedural information was available for 75 of these patients. The median degree of stenosis was 90% (range, 60%-99%). Indications for CAS were severe comorbidities (n = 49), prior CEA (n = 21), and prior neck radiation (n = 5). Twenty patients with primary lesions were treated selectively with atropine only if symptomatic bradycardia occurred (nonprophylactic group). Thirty-four patients with primary lesions received routine prophylactic atropine administration before balloon inflation or stent deployment (prophylactic group). The 21 patients with prior CEA received selective atropine treatment only if symptomatic bradycardia occurred (prior CEA group) and were analyzed separately. Mean age and cardiac comorbidities did not vary significantly either between the prophylactic and nonprophylactic atropine groups or between the primary and prior CEA patient groups. Outcome measures included bradycardia (decrease in heart rate >50% or absolute heart rate <40 bpm), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or mean blood pressure <50 mm Hg), requirement for vasopressors, and cardiac morbidity (myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure).\nThe overall incidence of hypotension and bradycardia in patients treated with CAS was 25 (33%) of 75. A decreased incidence of intraoperative bradycardia (9% vs 50%; P < .001) and perioperative cardiac morbidity (0% vs 15%; P < .05) was observed in patients with primary stenosis who received prophylactic atropine as compared with patients who did not receive prophylactic atropine. CAS after prior CEA was associated with a significantly lower incidence of perioperative bradycardia (10% vs 33%; P < .05), hypotension (5% vs 32%; P < .05), and vasopressor requirement (5% vs 30%; P < .05), with a trend toward a lower incidence of cardiac morbidity (0% vs 6%; not significant) as compared with patients treated with CAS for primary carotid lesions. There were no significant predictive demographic factors for bradycardia and hypotension after CAS.\nThe administration of prophylactic atropine before balloon inflation during CAS decreases the incidence of intraoperative bradycardia and cardiac morbidity in primary CAS patients. Periprocedural bradycardia, hypotension, and the need for vasopressors occur more frequently with primary CAS than with redo CAS procedures. On the basis of our data, we recommend that prophylactic atropine administration be considered in patients with primary carotid lesions undergoing CAS.",

    "abstract": "Neurologic complications during carotid artery stenting (CAS) are most clearly associated with embolization of visible debris. Distal filter devices may provide cerebral protection by capturing clinically significant debris. However, they increase procedural time and expense and have their own set of complications. The current study was undertaken to identify the clinical factors predictive for the presence or absence of visible debris captured by distal filter devices during CAS.\nPatients undergoing CAS with use of a distal filter device (n = 279) were prospectively entered into an investigational carotid registry. Recorded variables were classified as patient-, lesion-, or procedure-related. The filter was assessed for visible debris in each case. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for each variable to predict visible debris. The ability of each variable to predict the absence of visible debris was assessed by calculating the individual negative predictive value (NPV).\nVisible debris was present in 169 filters (60.3%). There was an increased risk of visible debris found with several variables (OR, 95% CI): hypertension (2.9, 1.7 to 5.2), hypercholesterolemia (2.3, 1.4 to 3.9), stent diameter >9 mm (16.6, 9.0 to 30.0), and any neurologic event (4.2, 1.5 to 9.9). The NPV failed to exceed 0.80 (80%) for any variable. The NPV of the variables with a significantly elevated OR was as follows: hypertension (0.60), hypercholesterolemia (0.52), stent diameter >9 mm (0.75), and any neurologic event (0.38).\nSeveral clinical variables are associated with the presence of visible debris captured by distal filter devices. The current study failed to identify any variables capable of consistently predicting the absence of visible debris. These findings support the routine rather than the selective use of cerebral protection during CAS.",

    "abstract": "Reoperative carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an accepted treatment for recurrent carotid stenosis. With reports of a higher operative morbidity than primary CEA and the advent of carotid stenting, catheter-based therapy has been advocated as the primary treatment for this reportedly \"high-risk\" subgroup. This study reviews a contemporary experience with reoperative CEA to validate the high-risk categorization of these patients.\nFrom 1989 to 2002, 153 consecutive, isolated (excluding CEA/coronary artery bypass graft and carotid bypass operations) reoperative CEA procedures were reviewed. Clinical and demographic variables potentially associated with the end points of perioperative morbidity, long-term durability, and late survival were assessed with multivariate analysis.\nThere were 153 reoperative CEA procedures in 145 patients (56% men, 36% symptomatic) with an average age of 69 +/- 1.3 years. The average time from primary CEA (68% primary closure, 23% prosthetic, 9% vein patch) to reoperative CEA was 6.1 +/- 0.4 years (range, 0.3 to 20.4 years). At reoperation, patch reconstruction was undertaken in 93% of cases. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.9%, with no deaths or cardiac complications. Other complications included cranial nerve injury (1.3%) and hematoma (3.2%). Average follow-up after reoperative CEA was 4.4 +/- 0.3 years (range, 0.1 to 12.7 years), with an overall total stroke-free rate of 96% and a restenosis rate (>50%) by carotid duplex of 9.2%. Among variables assessed for association with restenosis after reoperative CEA, only younger age was found to be significant (66 +/- 2.5 years vs 70 +/- 0.7 years, P < .05). The all-cause long-term mortality rate was 29%. Multivariate analysis of long-term survival identified diabetes mellitus as having a negative impact (hazard ratio, 3.4 +/- 0.3, P < .05) and lipid-lowering agents as having a protective effect (hazard ratio, 0.42 +/- 0.4, P < .05) on survival.\nReoperative CEA is a safe and durable procedure, comparable to reported standards for primary CEA, for long-term protection from stroke. These data do not support the contention that patients who require reoperative CEA constitute a \"high-risk\" subgroup in whom reoperative therapy should be avoided.",

The average time from primary CEA (68% primary closure, 23% prosthetic, 9% vein patch) to reoperative CEA was 6.1 +/- 0.4 years (range, 0.3 to 20.4 years). At reoperation, patch reconstruction was undertaken in 93% of cases. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.9%, with no deaths or cardiac complications. Other complications included cranial nerve injury (1.3%) and hematoma (3.2%). Average follow-up after reoperative CEA was 4.4 +/- 0.3 years (range, 0.1 to 12.7 years), with an overall total stroke-free rate of 96% and a restenosis rate (>50%) by carotid duplex of 9.2%. Among variables assessed for association with restenosis after reoperative CEA, only younger age was found to be significant (66 +/- 2.5 years vs 70 +/- 0.7 years, P < .05). The all-cause long-term mortality rate was 29%. Multivariate analysis of long-term survival identified diabetes mellitus as having a negative impact (hazard ratio, 3.4 +/- 0.3, P < .05) and lipid-lowering agents as having a protective effect (hazard ratio, 0.42 +/- 0.4, P < .05) on survival.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the clinical value of vascular laboratory surveillance after open or endovascular repair of popliteal aneurysm by analysis of the frequency and nature of secondary interventions performed.\nOver an 8-year period, 55 popliteal artery aneurysms were repaired in 46 men (mean age, 72 years) by aneurysm ligation and bypass grafting (vein, 37; prosthetic, 7), endoaneurysmorrhaphy and interposition grafting (prosthetic, 3; vein, 1), or endograft exclusion (n = 7). Indications for intervention included aneurysm thrombosis with critical limb ischemia (n = 8), symptomatic (n = 10) or asymptomatic (n = 37), >1.75 cm popliteal aneurysm with mural thrombus. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was used in three limbs to restore aneurysm and tibial artery patency before open repair. Duplex ultrasound surveillance was performed after repair to identify residual and acquired lesions. Life-table analysis was used to estimate repair site intervention-free (primary) and assisted-primary patency.\nDuring a mean 20-month follow-up interval, 20 secondary procedures were performed in 18 (31%) limbs to repair duplex-detected graft stenosis (n = 10), repair site thrombosis (n = 5), vein graft aneurysm (n = 3), graft entrapment (n = 1), or type 1 endoleak (n = 1). Primary patency was 76% and 68% at 1 and 3 years, and was uninfluenced by tibial artery runoff status or type of bypass conduit. Open (n = 12) or endovascular (n = 8) secondary procedures were performed on 15 (12 vein, 3 prosthetic) bypass grafts, 2 endografts, and 1 interposition graft. Mean time to repair graft stenosis (11 months) was shorter than to repair of vein graft aneurysm (37 months). Assisted-primary patency was 93% and 88% at 1 and 3 years; redo bypass grafting was required and successful in five limbs. Limb salvage was 100%.\nOne third of popliteal artery aneurysms repaired by open or endovascular procedures required a secondary intervention within 2 years of repair. Repair-site surveillance using duplex ultrasound was able to identify lesions that threaten patency, which resulted in excellent assisted patency and limb preservation rates when corrected.",

    "abstract": "This report presents our experience with open repair of post-traumatic aneurysms of the aortic isthmus using recent surgical techniques, including distal aortic perfusion and the preferential use of direct aortoaortic anastomosis without interposition of prosthetic material.\nFrom 1990 to 2004, the senior author (EK) patients (21 men; mean age, 40.3 years) who presented with post-traumatic aneurysms of the aortic isthmus were treated operatively, either with (20 patients) or without (3 patients) distal aortic perfusion, or endovascularly with a stent graft (3 patients). In 15 (75 %) of the 20 patients treated with distal aortic perfusion, the technique consisted of resection followed by direct aortoaortic anastomosis. Eight patients, including the three patients treated with simple clamping, had prosthetic replacement.\nNo postoperative deaths or permanent spinal cord complications occurred. One patient required reoperation to control hemorrhage. Aortography or computed tomography angiography was performed on 12 of the 15 patients treated by direct aortoaortic anastomosis, with a mean follow-up of 58.7 +/- 8.9 months. No morphologic abnormality was found.\nThis study shows that low-risk patients with a chronic post-traumatic aneurysm of the aortic isthmus can be successfully treated with excellent long-term results by resection and direct aortoaortic anastomosis without prosthetic interposition. In our opinion, endovascular repair should only be used in patients who present with absolute contraindications for open surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "To determine the impact on late postoperative renal function of suprarenal and infrarenal fixation of endografts used to treat infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nRetrospective analysis of 277 patients treated from 2000 to 2003 with three different endografts at two clinical centers. Five patients on dialysis for preoperative chronic renal failure were excluded. Group IF of 135 patients treated with an infrarenal device (Medtronic AneuRx) was compared with group SF of 137 patients treated with a suprarenal device (106 Cook Zenith and 31 Medtronic Talent). Renal function was evaluated by calculating preoperative and latest postoperative creatinine clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft formula. Patients who developed a >20% decrease in CrCl were considered to have significantly impaired renal function.\nThere were no significant differences in patient age, sex, aneurysm size, preoperative risk factors, dose of intra- and postoperative contrast, or baseline CrCl (IF: 69.3 mL/min, SF: 71.7 mL/min, P = .4). Follow-up time of 12.2 months was the same in both groups. CrCl decreased significantly during the follow-up period in both groups (IF: 69.3 mL/min to 61.7 mL/min, P < .01; SF: 71.7 mL/min to 64.9 mL/min, P < .03). Postoperative CrCl (IF: 61.7 mL/min, SF: 64.9 mL/min, P = .3), and the rate of CrCl decrease during the follow-up period (IF: -10.9%, SF: -9.5%, P = .2) was not different between the two groups. The number of patients with a >20% decrease in CrCl was not different between the two groups (IF: n = 35 [25.9%], SF: n = 41 [29.9%], P = .46). However, the magnitude of decrease in CrCl in patients with renal impairment was greater in patients treated with suprarenal fixation endografts (SF: -39%) compared with those treated with infrarenal endografts (IF: -31%, P = .005). This greater degree of renal impairment was not due to identifiable differences in preoperative risk factors, age, or baseline CrCl. No patients in these series required dialysis.\nRegardless the type of endograft used, there is a 10% decrease in CrCl in the first year after endovascular aneurysm repair. Suprarenal fixation does not seem to increase the likelihood of postoperative renal impairment. Decline in renal function over time after endovascular aortic repair is probably due to multiple factors, and measures known to be effective in protecting kidneys should be considered for these patients. Long-term follow-up with measurement of CrCl, along with renal imaging and regular blood pressure measurements, should be performed to detect possible late renal dysfunction. Prospective studies comparing suprarenal versus infrarenal fixation are needed to confirm those results.",

    "abstract": "The release of catabolic stress hormones because of surgical trauma leads to a breakdown of fats, proteins, and carbohydrate stores and interference with immune function. This can delay wound healing and may increase the risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis and postoperative complications. Minimally invasive surgery can attenuate this response. Our purpose was (1) to compare neuroendocrine responses in patients undergoing open abdominal aneurysm repair with those in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), (2) to compare the incidence of SIRS/sepsis and all complications in these two groups, and (3) to look at the relationship between procedure type, neuroendocrine response, and incidence of SIRS/sepsis and complications.\nForty-six patients who underwent open repair and 19 who underwent EVAR were studied. A baseline (T1) 24-hour urine save was undertaken in the week before admission, and a second 24-hour save (T2) commenced at anesthetic induction to measure cortisol and catecholamines. The incidences of SIRS/sepsis and complications were recorded.\nSignificant ( P </= .001) increases in cortisol and adrenaline from T1 to T2 occurred in all patients. Controlling for the type of anesthetic, the administration of exogenous inotropes, and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), there was a significant difference in cortisol (T2) associated with the type of procedure. Responses were greater in open patients in comparison to EVAR patients (F 3,61 = 5.0; P = .03). The incidence of SIRS (50% vs 32%), sepsis (26% vs 5%), and all complications (76% vs 32%) was significantly ( P </= .02) higher in open than EVAR patients, respectively. Cortisol and adrenaline measured for 24 hours, commencing at the time of induction, tended to be higher in patients with SIRS/sepsis and all complications, but this did not reach significance.\nAn attenuated glucocorticoid surge characterizes the reduced stress response experienced by patients undergoing EVAR compared with open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. A reduction in the occurrence of SIRS is a feature of a more favorable postoperative course after an endovascular approach.",

Vascular clamps, vessel loops, intraluminal occluding devices, and tourniquets have been used to control the tibial and pedal vessels but may cause injury or fail to control heavily calcified arteries. We describe an alternative way to control proximal and distal small arteries by using small, umbilical vein, feeding catheters. The catheters are introduced in the proximal and distal arterial lumen and in the vein graft lumen, achieving hemostasis, technically facilitating the suturing, and providing a means for the administration of vasodilator or thrombolytic agents as well as for a completion angiography.",

He had undergone a radical gastrectomy and catheter intubation in the common hepatic artery for chemotherapy 12 months before admission. The diagnosis of giant infected hepatic-celiac artery pseudoaneurysm was established. Coils embolotherapy was given in another hospital, but it failed. After admission, a computed tomographic aortogram showed a mass 10.3 x 8.5 x 8.1 cm in size in the right upper abdomen that originated from the common hepatic artery and the celiac artery. A celiac-super mesenteric artery (SMA) double catheter simultaneous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) further revealed that the entrance of the aneurysm opened directly from the abdominal aorta, the distance between the orifice of SMA and celiac axis was only 0.5 cm, and the diameter of the celiac trunk had been aneurysmally enlarged to 2.0 cm. A blood culture was positive for Bacillus pyocyaneus. After detailed discussion and preparation, a stent-graft complex was negotiated through the left femoral artery and deployed successfully into the abdominal aorta to seal the orifice of celiac trunk under the dynamic supervision of DSA. Completion angiography revealed that the hepatic-celiac pseudoaneurysm was completely excluded from aortic flow by the endoluminal stent-graft complex, while the SMA and renal arteries remained perfectly patent. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged without any residual symptoms. At a 5-year follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and was leading a normal life.",

    "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii, the etiologic agent of Q fever, is mainly responsible for endocarditis with negative blood culture results, but only a few cases of C. burnetii infections of aortic aneurysms have been published. We report three cases of abdominal aortic aneurysms treated in patients with Q fever infection with simultaneous endocarditis (n = 1) and previous history of cardiac valve replacement for endocarditis (n = 1). A coeliac aortic aneurysm was diagnosed in one patient treated for acute Q fever with persistent serologic results showing chronic infection despite adequate antibiotic therapy and without endocarditis. Resection of the aneurysm cured the chronic infection, and C. burnetii was identified by culture of the aneurysmal wall. In the two other cases, chronic infection of C. burnetii was diagnosed by serologic examination after surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. One patient with negative blood culture results had amaurosis fugax due to endocarditis and required aortic valve replacement; recurrent fever without evidence of valve dysfunction or infection developed in one patient who had had prosthetic cardiac valve replacement 6 months earlier for endocarditis. Aortic aneurysms were treated with in situ prosthetic grafts and long-term antibiotic therapy. At a mean follow-up of 12 years, no septic aortic complications occurred, and serologic test results have remained negative. The presence of an aortic aneurysm and cardiac valve disease seems to be a predisposing factor for chronic C. burnetii infection. Diagnosis particularly relies on the physician's awareness of this condition and is confirmed by serologic examination. Aortic aneurysm resection is mandatory to cure the chronic infection and must be associated with long-term antibiotic therapy.",

An axillobifemoral bypass allowed distal perfusion and retrograde visceral artery perfusion while maintaining normal blood pressure. The abdominal pain resolved, urine output increased, and the patient was discharged on day 7.

    "abstract": "Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) confers vein wall injury associated with fibrosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, likely mediated by matrix proteases. This study investigated the expression of proteases and collagen involved in early vein wall remodeling.\nIn the mouse, DVT was produced by ligation of the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC) or sham operation, and tissue was harvested at 4, 8, and 12 days. The vein wall tissue was processed for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (6 to 8 per time point), Western immunoblotting (5 per time point), and gelatin zymography (5 per time point). Analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons, and a P < .05 was significant.\nThrombus resolution was documented by a 38% decrease in the thrombosed IVC weight from day 4 to day 12 (P = .007). Total vein wall collagen increased over time, with a corresponding increase in procollagen I and III, and expression peaked at 12 days (24-fold and 6.1-fold, respectively, P < .02). Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) gene expression was 23-fold greater at 12 days after thrombus formation compared with sham or 4 days after thrombosis (P < .05). Total MMP-2 activity was also significantly elevated at 12 days compared with sham (P < .05). MMP-9 expression was 19-fold and 27-fold higher at days 4 and 8, respectively, relative to sham (P < .05), with no difference in activity. MMP-14 expression was twofold to 3.6-fold greater at day 12 compared with earlier time points and shams (P < .001), but no differences in protein levels were found. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) protein levels were not significantly different from sham over time; however, the ratio of uPA to PAI-1 was decreased through 8 days.\nVein wall remodeling after DVT is similar to wound healing and is associated with increased procollagen gene expression and total collagen. It is also associated with increased early MMP-9 expression, followed by MMP-2 expression and activity after DVT resolution.\nDeep vein thrombosis is an often neglected problem that long term is associated with the postphlebitic syndrome of limb swelling, pain, and often ulceration. The basic mechanisms of the vein wall damage that results have not been delineated. The following study describes the vein wall matrix metalloproteinase gene and activity response induced over time in the vein wall after DVT. Additionally, the corresponding collagen upregulation and proximate plasmin system mediators are determined. With this knowledge, potential therapies to reduce vein wall injury directly might be possible.",

Total vein wall collagen increased over time, with a corresponding increase in procollagen I and III, and expression peaked at 12 days (24-fold and 6.1-fold, respectively, P < .02). Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) gene expression was 23-fold greater at 12 days after thrombus formation compared with sham or 4 days after thrombosis (P < .05). Total MMP-2 activity was also significantly elevated at 12 days compared with sham (P < .05). MMP-9 expression was 19-fold and 27-fold higher at days 4 and 8, respectively, relative to sham (P < .05), with no difference in activity. MMP-14 expression was twofold to 3.6-fold greater at day 12 compared with earlier time points and shams (P < .001), but no differences in protein levels were found. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) protein levels were not significantly different from sham over time; however, the ratio of uPA to PAI-1 was decreased through 8 days.",

    "abstract": "Renal impairment is a very frequent complication of aortic surgery requiring prolonged suprarenal clamping, especially if it is associated with previous hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to assess the beneficial effect of the administration of a nitric oxide (NO) donor on renal function through a modulation of the systemic inflammatory response in a model of abdominal aortic surgery.\nTwenty-five minipigs were divided into five groups. Under anesthesia, the animals were subjected to suprarenal aortic-iliac clamping (for 30 minutes) and bypass with a Dacron-collagen prosthetic graft impregnated in rifampicin, with or without associated hemorrhage (40% of total blood volume). Prophylaxis with cefazolin was implemented. The five groups were (1) the sham group (only aortic dissection), (2) the clamping and bypass (C) group, (3) hemorrhage preclamping and bypass (H+C) group, (4) the same as group C but with the administration of the NO donor molsidomine (4 mg/kg intravenously) (C+NO group), (5) the same as the H+C group but with the administration of the NO donor molsidomine (4 mg/kg intravenously) (H+C+NO group). The following were determined: (1) kidney function (serum creatinine), (2) serum cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha] and interleukin-10 [IL-10]); (3) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase [MPO]) in the kidney, (4) oxygen free radicals (superoxide anion [SOA] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) in the kidney, (5) serum nitrites, (6) soluble and kidney tissue cell adhesion molecule (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1], soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [sVCAM-1], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]), (7) inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the kidney, and (8) nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the kidney. Determinations were made during ischemia at 15 minutes post-reperfusion; at 24, 48, and 72 hours; and on day 7.\nThe different insults used in the experimental model led to deterioration in kidney function and an increase in the systemic (and renal) inflammatory response at all levels investigated. Treatment with an NO donor, both with and without associated hemorrhage, reduced the inflammatory response at the systemic (TNF-alpha and IL-10) and kidney (MPO, SOA, and SOD) levels, normalizing kidney function. Likewise, exogenous administration of NO improved the excessive production of NO (nitrites) via iNOS. This was also reflected in a reduction in CAMs and of NF-kappaB expression. The hypotension induced by molsidomine was transitory and did not elicit hemodynamic repercussions.\nIn our experimental model, prophylactic treatment with the NO donor molsidomine regulates the systemic inflammatory response and minimizes damage at the kidney level. Clinical Relevance The importance of this article resides in the fact that an experimental study that clarifies the effect of the donors of NO under circumstances as similar as possible to those of the human clinic, such as aortic surgery under hypovolemic shock (ruptured aortic aneurysm) have been little studied, most of these studies being performed in rodents without bypass. Using a model with one or two simultaneous insults (aortic clamping with/without previous hemorrhage) that is very similar to the human clinical situation (abdominal aortic rupture), we confirm the findings of previous work related to the beneficial effects of NO donors.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the pattern of clinical results in patients with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (N-TOS) after operative decompression and longitudinal follow-up.\nFrom May 1994 to December 2002, 254 operative sides in 185 patients with N-TOS were treated by the same operative protocol: (1) transaxillary first rib resection and the lower part of scalenectomy for the primary procedure with or without (2) the subsequent upper part of scalenectomy with supraclavicular approach for patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms. This retrospective cohort study included 38 men and 147 women with an age range of 19 to 80 years (mean, 40 years). Evaluated were primary success, defined as uninterrupted success with no procedure performed, and secondary success, defined as success maintained by the secondary operation after the primary failure. Success was defined as > or =50% symptomatic improvement judged by the patient using a 10-point scale, returning to preoperational work status, or both.\nFollow-up was 2 to 76 months (mean, 25 months). Eighty sides underwent a secondary operation for the primary clinical failure. No technical failures and no deaths occurred < o =30 days after the operations. The complication rate was 4% (13/334) and consisted of 7 pneumothoraxes, 3 subclavian vein injuries, 1 nerve injury, 1 internal mammary artery injury, and 1 suture granuloma. Of 254 operative sides, the primary and secondary success was 46% (118/254) and 64% (163/254). Most the primary failures (90%, 122/136) and the secondary failures (66%, 23/35) occurred < or =18 months after the respective operation.\nThe long-term results of operations for TOS in this study were much worse than those initially achieved, and most of the primary and secondary failures occurred < or =12 months of the respective operations. A minimum of 18-month follow-up on patients and standardized definition of the outcomes are necessary to determine the true effectiveness and outcome of operative treatment of N-TOS.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment of arterial lesions associated with Beh\u00e7et disease (BD) is often complicated by graft occlusion and recurrence of aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to clarify the long-term outcome of surgical intervention for arterial involvement in BD.\nTen patients with BD (9 men, 1 woman) who underwent surgical treatment for arterial aneurysms between 1980 and 2004 were included in the study. The age of patients at the first operation ranged from 36 to 69 years (mean, 50.4 +/- 9.0 years). The mean period between the onset of BD and that of arterial manifestations was 8.0 +/- 5.0 years. We retrospectively reviewed their postoperative courses, including survival, graft occlusion, formation of anastomotic false aneurysms, and the development of aneurysms at different sites. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the chronologic incidence of complications after surgery.\nThe mean follow-up period was 133 +/- 92 months, ranging from 5 to 285 months. One patient died of rupture of a dissecting aortic aneurysm after undergoing several surgical interventions for multiple aneurysms. There were five graft occlusions among 21 grafts. The cumulative primary graft patency rate in the infrainguinal region was 83.9% at 3 years. Five anastomotic false aneurysms formed among 49 anastomoses between grafts and host arteries. The overall cumulative incidence of formation of anastomotic pseudoaneurysm was 12.9% at 5 and 10 years. All of them formed within 18 months after surgery. Development of new aneurysms in different arteries was observed in two patients.\nEarly occurrence of anastomotic false aneurysm is characteristic of BD. Further investigation is necessary to establish effective postoperative treatment.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that infectious organisms play a role in vascular diseases. In this study, to explore a possible link between oral infection and Buerger disease, we investigated whether oral (periodontal) bacteria were present in occluded arteries removed from patients with characteristic Buerger disease.\nFourteen male patients with a smoking history who had developed characteristics of Buerger disease before the age of 50 years were included in this study. Occluded arteries, including superficial femoral (n = 4), popliteal (n = 2), anterior tibial (n = 4), and posterior tibial (n = 4) arteries, were removed and studied. A periodontist performed a periodontal examination on each patient and collected dental plaque and saliva samples from them at the same time. The polymerase chain reaction method was applied to detect whether seven species of periodontal bacteria--Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter rectus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia , and Prevotella nigrescens--were present in the occluded arteries and oral samples. In addition, arterial specimens from seven control patients were examined by polymerase chain reaction analysis.\nDNA of oral bacteria was detected in 13 of 14 arterial samples and all oral samples of patients with Buerger disease. Treponema denticola was found in 12 arterial and all oral samples. Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Prevotella nigrescens were found in 14% to 43% of the arterial samples and 71% to 100% of the oral samples. A pathologic examination revealed that arterial specimens showed the characteristics of an intermediate-chronic-stage or chronic-stage lesion of Buerger disease. All 14 patients with Buerger disease had moderate to severe periodontitis. None of the control arterial samples was positive for periodontal bacteria.\nThis is the first study to identify oral microorganisms in the lesions of Buerger disease. Our findings suggest a possible etiologic link between Buerger disease and chronic infections such as oral bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS-IV) results from abnormal procollagen III synthesis and leads to arterial, intestinal, and uterine rupture. The purpose of this study was to review the spectrum, management, and clinical outcome of EDS-IV patients.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 31 patients (15 male and 16 female) with a clinical diagnosis of EDS-IV treated over a 30-year period (1971 to 2001). Biochemical confirmation was obtained in 24 patients, and mutation of the COL3A1 gene was confirmed in 11 patients. The study excluded patients with other connective tissue dysplasias.\nThe mean age at the time of diagnosis was 28.5 +/- 11 years (range, 10 to 53 years). Twenty-four patients developed 132 vascular complications; of these, 85 were present either before or at the time of the initial evaluation, and 47 complications occurred during a median follow-up of 6.3 years (range, 0.5 to 26 years). Survival free of vascular complications was 90% at age 20 years, 39% at 40 years, and 20% at age 60 years. Fifteen patients underwent 30 operative interventions for vascular complications, including arterial reconstruction (n = 15), simple repair or ligation (n = 4), coil embolization (n = 3), splenectomy (n = 2), and abdominal decompression, nephrectomy, graft thrombectomy, vein stripping and thoracoscopy (n = 1 each). Three hospital deaths occurred from exsanguinating hemorrhage: two after operative interventions and one because of a ruptured splenic artery. Procedure-related morbidity was 46%, including a 37% incidence of postoperative bleeding and a 20% need for re-exploration. The incidence of late graft-related complications was 40% of arterial reconstructions, including 4 anastomotic aneurysms, 1 fatal anastomotic disruption, and 1 graft thrombosis. Patient survival was 68% at age 50 years and 35% at age 80 years. Of the 12 deaths during the study period, 11 were associated with vascular or graft-related complications.\nOperative mortality in patients with vascular complications of EDS-IV was not excessively high, but the incidence of postoperative bleeding complications and late graft-related problems was significant. Despite successful repair of vascular complications, survival was shortened because of secondary vascular or graft-related complications.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate limb-salvage surgery with vascular resection for lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS) in adult patients and to classify blood vessel involvement.\nSubjects were consecutive patients (median age, 56 years) who underwent vascular replacement during surgery of STS in the lower limb between January 1988 and December 2003. Blood vessel involvement by STS was classified as follows: type I, artery and vein; type II, artery only; type III, vein only; and type IV, neither artery nor vein (excluded from the analysis). Patient data were prospectively gathered in a computerized database.\nTwenty-one (9.9%) of 213 patients underwent vascular resections for lower limb STS. Besides 17 type I tumors (81.0%), 3 (14.3%) type II and 1 (4.7%) type III STS were diagnosed. Arterial reconstruction was performed for all type I and II tumors. Venous replacement in type I and III tumors was performed in 66.7% of patients. Autologous vein (n = 8) and synthetic (Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene; n = 12) bypasses were used with comparable frequency for arterial repair, whereas expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were implanted in veins. Morbidity was 57.2% (hematoma, thrombosis, and infection), and mortality was 5% (embolism). At a median follow-up of 34 months, the primary and secondary patency rates of arterial (venous) reconstructions were 58.3% (54.9%) and 78.3% (54.9%). Limb salvage was achieved in 94.1% of all cases. The 5-year local control rate and survival rate were 80.4% and 52%, respectively. We observed a 5-year metastasis-free survival rate of 37.7% and found vessel infiltration and higher tumor grade (low-grade vs intermediate grade and high grade tumors) to be negative prognostic factors at univariate and multivariate analysis.\nLong-term bypass patency rates, the high percentage of limb salvage, and the oncologic outcome underline the efficacy of en bloc resection of STS involving major vessels in the lower limb. Disease-specific morbidity must be anticipated. The classification of vascular involvement (type I to IV) is useful for surgical management.",

    "abstract": "To test whether the availability of vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in a region affects revascularization and amputation rates for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nWe identified all patients with PAD in the Medicare claims database in 1994 and tracked their claims through 1999. We aggregated risk-adjusted data on the 143,202 patients who survived through 1999 by Hospital Referral Region and merged this data with information on local physician supply and other regional characteristics. Instrumental variables analysis was used to account for unobserved illness severity. Main outcome measures were risk-adjusted rates of lower extremity bypass surgery, angioplasty, and amputation by region.\nIncreasing vascular surgeon supply in a region by approximately one standard deviation (.30/10,000 Medicare beneficiaries) is associated with a 0.9 percentage point increase in bypass surgery rates and a 1.6 percentage point reduction in amputation rates. We find weaker evidence that greater availability of interventional radiologists increases angioplasty rates and reduces amputation rates. Factors reflecting regional attractiveness, such as the rating of a region based on climate, recreation, crime, and other attributes, were strong independent predictors of the number of vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in an area.\nAvailability of specialists affects outcomes for PAD patients. Regional variability in specialists who treat PAD is influenced by factors other than regional medical needs. Policies aimed at increasing the supply of vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists and their provision of bypass surgery in underserved areas may help to reduce regional disparities in amputation.",

    "abstract": "The atherosclerotic process has inflammatory features. Patients with peripheral atherosclerosis and critical limb ischemia have a poor prognosis. This study evaluated the hypothesis that inflammatory markers are associated with mortality among patients admitted to the hospital because of critical limb ischemia.\nThis was a prospective, single-center, 1-year, follow-up study of 259 consecutive patients with critical limb ischemia who were admitted to a secondary referral center of vascular diseases. Interventions included evaluation of intercurrent disease, ankle and arm blood pressures, plasma glucose and lipid levels, plasma homocysteine, cardiolipin antibodies, resistance to activated protein C, plasma endothelin-1, and the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, neopterin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, CD40 ligand, and 8-iso-prostaglandin F alpha in plasma. The main outcome measure was total mortality and causes of death assessed 1 year after admission.\nDuring the first year after admission, 61 patients (24%) died. These patients were older (P < .0001), showed a higher leukocyte count (P = .0011) and levels of serum creatinine (P < .0001), lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P = .003) and frequency of active treatment (P = .014) than the 198 (76%) survivors. More nonsurvivors had gangrene (P < .0001), and fewer (P = .004) had lipid-lowering treatment. The plasma levels of interleukin-6 (P < .0001), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P < .0001), neopterin (P < .0001), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = .002) at admission for critical limb ischemia were all significantly lower in the survivors, whereas there was no difference concerning CD40 ligand. In logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, lipid-lowering therapy, active treatment, gangrene, leukocyte count, creatinine, and serum HDL cholesterol, the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P = .0084), neopterin (P = .0035), but not interleukin-6 (P = .585) or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = .314) were independent risk variables of death within 1 year.\nIncreased age, leukocyte count, creatinine, and inflammatory mediators, together with gangrene, were associated with 1-year mortality despite intervention in critical limb ischemia. For tumor necrosis factor-alpha and neopterin in plasma, this association was independent of the other parameters.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is the major risk factor associated with the development and progression of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). To establish the best estimate of the effect of smoking, smoking cessation, and the dose-response relationship on the patency of lower extremity bypass grafts, we performed a systematic review.\nA search of medical articles and reviews relating to the influence of smoking on the patency of arterial reconstructive grafts in patients with PAD was made. Studies considered for inclusion were those that evaluated the influence of smoking on the primary, secondary, or cumulative patency rates of arterial reconstructive surgery in the lower extremities in patients with PAD. Primary data were used to calculate summary estimates with standard meta-analysis techniques.\nThe 29 eligible studies included 4 randomized clinical trials, 12 prospective studies, and 13 retrospective studies. The effect of smoking on graft patency in the randomized clinical trials and other prospective studies had a 3.09-fold (2.34 to 4.08; P < .00001) increase in graft failure. A comparison of patency rates among all studies that used autogenous or polyester grafts showed no difference. A clear dose-response relationship was present, with a decreased patency in heavy smokers compared with moderate smokers. Smoking cessation restores patency rates toward the never smokers group.\nContinued smoking after lower limb bypass surgery results in a threefold increased risk of graft failure. Smoking cessation, even if instigated after the operation, restored graft patency towards the patency of never smokers. These results indicate that adequate smoking cessation strategies in patients eligible for lower limb bypass surgery are of utmost importance.",

    "abstract": "To determine intraobserver and interobserver variability of carotid arteriography interpretation as well as the reliability of simple visual interpretation (SVI) or \"eyeballing\" of arteriography in the measurement of internal carotid artery stenoses.\nIntraobserver and interobserver measurements of 200 carotid arteriograms were performed in a blinded fashion by two vascular surgeons (VS1 and VS2) using a digital caliber computer program similar to software available in catheterization laboratories. The distal normal internal carotid artery was used as a frame of reference. These computer-derived measurements were compared with previous SVI measurements, found by retrospective chart review, that were performed at the initial time of arteriography.\nIntraobserver agreement (VS1a vs VS1b and VS2a vs VS2b) within +/-5% using the computer program was 94% and 92%. Interobserver agreement within +/-5% using the computer program for the four possible combinations ranged from 43% to 48%. Interobserver agreement using the computer program increased to 83% to 88% for correct stenosis interpretation within +/-20%. In the 16% to 49% category (by computer measurement), SVI would have placed the stenosis in a higher category 40% to 56% of the time. Likewise, in the 50% to 79% category, comparing SVI with the four different computer caliber measurements, SVI overestimated the stenosis to the 80% to 99% category by 30% to 44%. In the 80% to 99% category, SVI overestimated lesions in 27% to 51% of the cases. All occlusions seen on SVI correlated with computer program measurements. The computer readings in many cases downgraded the degree of carotid stenosis into a lower category and in some cases, may have led to a different treatment paradigm. SVI never underestimated carotid stenosis compared with all matched computer program measurements.\nCompared with a method of objective measurement similar to that used in a catheterization laboratory, SVI overestimated most carotid artery stenoses. Given the coming era of carotid stenting and a renewed need for arteriography before carotid intervention, knowledge of variability and correct interpretation of carotid stenosis using available technology remains paramount to warranted treatment.",

    "abstract": "Although the surgical management of brachiocephalic disease is well established, evolving endovascular techniques present new options for treatment. We explored the potential benefits and drawbacks of these interventions in terms of outcome.\nFrom 1966 to 2004, 391 consecutive patients (43.7% male; mean age, 61.9 years) with single-vessel brachiocephalic disease were treated with either operative bypass (group A; n = 229) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (group B; n = 162).\nAll patients were asymptomatic after surgery or endovascular intervention. Group A and group B had similar operative mortality (0.9% vs 0.6%) and stroke (1.3% vs 0%) rates. However, 5 years after the procedure, group A had significantly better freedom from graft or intervention failure (92.7% +/- 2.1%) than did group B (83.9% +/- 3.7%; P = .03, Kaplan-Meier analysis; P = .001, Cox regression analysis). At 10 years, group A had the following rates of actuarial freedom from specific events: death, 73.7% +/- 4.6%; myocardial infarction, 84.2% +/- 3.6%; stroke, 91.4% +/- 3.4%; graft failure, 88.1% +/- 3.3%; coronary revascularization, 69.8% +/- 5.1%; and other vascular operation, 70.7% +/- 4.6%. Endovascular intervention involved less initial cost (mean savings, $8787 per procedure), was less invasive, and did not necessitate general anesthesia. On satisfaction questionnaires, 96.5% of patients receiving an endovascular intervention and 95.1% of patients receiving operative bypass for single-vessel brachiocephalic disease subjectively rated their treatment as \"good\" or \"very good.\"\nOperative bypass and endovascular intervention for single-vessel brachiocephalic disease are both associated with acceptably low operative morbidity and mortality. Operative bypass produces significantly better mid-term freedom from graft or intervention failure than endovascular intervention and produces excellent long-term freedom from failure. Endovascular intervention offers tangible benefits regarding cost, level of invasiveness, and subjective patient satisfaction. Undetermined are the differences between the procedures regarding long-term durability, patterns of failure, efficacy as an adjunct to coronary artery bypass grafting, need for anticoagulation, efficacy as treatment for complex (multivessel) disease, and long-term cost.",

    "abstract": "Complex brachiocephalic disease involves multiple vessels and is frequently associated with multisystem atherosclerosis. We reviewed surgical outcome and examined the impact of this problem on decision making regarding operative staging, technique, and choice of conduit.\nBetween 1966 and 2000, 157 consecutive patients (mean age, 54.0 years; 48.4% male) with innominate artery or multivessel brachiocephalic disease underwent operative reconstruction using either a transthoracic approach (group A, n = 113) or a less invasive, extrathoracic approach (group B, n = 44). Reconstruction required multiple distal anastomoses in 70 patients (44.6%), concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 37 patients (23.6%), and concomitant carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 26 patients (16.6%).\nNo significant differences were found between group A and group B when operative mortality (2.7% vs 2.3%) and stroke rates (2.7% vs 6.8%) were analyzed. However, 10 years after surgery, freedom from graft failure was significantly better in group A (94.4% +/- 4.4%) than in group B (60.3% +/- 13.4%) ( P = .002). Freedom from graft failure was adversely affected by nonaortic inflow ( P = .002) and axillo-axillary cervical grafts ( P = .0001). Mortality and stroke rates for subgroups having multiple distal anastomoses (2.9%, 2/70 and 4.3%, 3/70), concomitant CABG (5.4%, 2/37 and 0, 0/37), and concomitant CEA (3.8%, 1/26 and 3.8%, 1/26) were similar to those of other patients. For the entire patient group, 10-year rates of actuarial freedom from specific events were death, 68.8% +/- 6.0%; myocardial infarction, 86.7% +/- 4.5%; stroke, 87.0% +/- 4.4%; coronary revascularization, 88.0% +/- 3.6%, and other vascular operation, 79.9% +/- 4.4%.\nTransthoracic arch reconstruction for complex brachiocephalic disease can be done with acceptably low morbidity and mortality similar to those of a less invasive, extrathoracic approach. Furthermore, the transthoracic approach is associated with significantly better long-term freedom from graft failure, possibly because it preserves aortic inflow to the great vessels. Nonetheless, the high frequency of late events in this relatively young patient population reflects the presence of multisystem atherosclerosis and suggests the need for close follow-up and lifestyle modification.",

    "abstract": "Gold coating improves stent visibility under fluoroscopy. This is particularly valuable for precise stent placement during renal artery stenting (RAS). There is conflicting evidence regarding restenosis with gold-coated stents. To evaluate the effect of gold coating on restenosis after renal stenting, we reviewed the results of all patients undergoing RAS in our practice.\nA retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing RAS between June 2000 and September 2003 was performed. During this time, both gold-coated and stainless steel stents were used. Restenosis (>60% diameter) was determined by serial follow-up duplex exams (peak systolic velocity >180 cm/s and renal-aortic ratio >3.5). Restenosis rates were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier life-table method. Variables potentially affecting restenosis were evaluated with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards modeling.\nRAS was performed in 97 arteries (78 patients). Gold-coated (NIRoyal) stents were placed in 59 arteries (48 patients). Stainless steel stents (Corinthian, Genesis, and Herculink) were placed in 38 arteries (34 patients). Patient demographics, indication for treatment, technical success, and complications did not differ between gold and stainless steel stent groups. Mean follow-up was 15 months for gold-coated stents and 18 months for stainless steel stents (NS). By life-table method, 1-year and 2-year freedom from restenosis rates were 84% and 78% in arteries treated with stainless steel stents versus 69% and 39% in those treated with gold-coated stents (P = .012, log-rank test). By multivariate analysis, only the use of gold-coated stents (P = .018; hazard ratio [HR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 8.7) and bilateral disease (P = .046; HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.2) predicted restenosis. Stent diameter, patient demographics, and indication for RAS had no effect on restenosis by univariate analysis. According to American Heart Association criteria, 87% of patients in the stainless steel group had improved blood pressure at 1 year, compared with 77% in the gold-coated stent group (Kaplan-Meier; P = .042, log-rank test). There were no significant differences in the effect of RAS on serum creatinine levels between the two groups.\nGold-coated renal stents had a substantially higher rate of restenosis than stainless steel stents in our series. These findings have led us to abandon the use of gold-coated stents for RAS. Patients who have received gold-coated stents for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis should be followed closely for evidence of restenosis.",

Stainless steel stents (Corinthian, Genesis, and Herculink) were placed in 38 arteries (34 patients). Patient demographics, indication for treatment, technical success, and complications did not differ between gold and stainless steel stent groups. Mean follow-up was 15 months for gold-coated stents and 18 months for stainless steel stents (NS). By life-table method, 1-year and 2-year freedom from restenosis rates were 84% and 78% in arteries treated with stainless steel stents versus 69% and 39% in those treated with gold-coated stents (P = .012, log-rank test). By multivariate analysis, only the use of gold-coated stents (P = .018; hazard ratio [HR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 8.7) and bilateral disease (P = .046; HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.2) predicted restenosis. Stent diameter, patient demographics, and indication for RAS had no effect on restenosis by univariate analysis. According to American Heart Association criteria, 87% of patients in the stainless steel group had improved blood pressure at 1 year, compared with 77% in the gold-coated stent group (Kaplan-Meier; P = .042, log-rank test). There were no significant differences in the effect of RAS on serum creatinine levels between the two groups.",

    "abstract": "The femoropopliteal vein (FPV) has been used successfully for vascular reconstructions at multiple sites. To date, there have been no studies documenting patency of the FPV graft in the femorofemoral position. Our goal was to assess long-term patency of the FPV graft used for femorofemoral bypass (FFBP).\nPatients undergoing FFBP over a 10-year period were studied. Those in whom the FPV was used as a conduit were analyzed for runoff resistance score to assess how patients with poor runoff fared. Poor runoff was defined as a runoff resistance score of > or =7 (1 = normal runoff, 10 = total occlusion of all runoff vessels).\nFifty-four patients underwent FPV FFBP as a sole procedure (n = 16, 30%) or as a portion of an aortofemoral reconstruction with a FFBP component (n = 38, 70%). Mean (+/- SD) follow-up was 47 +/- 33 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year primary patencies were 97%, 93%, and 76%. The 5-year assisted primary and secondary patency rates were 85% and 90%. Among 27 patients with poor runoff (runoff resistance score of > or =7), the cumulative 40 month patency rate was 90%. Among patients in whom FPV FFBP was performed as a primary procedure (no aortofemoral component), there were no graft failures.\nFFBP performed with FPV has excellent 1-, 3, and 5-year patency rates. FPV has sustained patency for FFBP in patients with poor runoff.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass (LABF) has been performed for diffuse aortoiliac occlusive disease in a few large centers. We hypothesize that in selected patients LABF can be performed safely and is a viable, minimally invasive approach to aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of all individuals undergoing LABF over a 2.5-year period in a community-based vascular surgery practice.\nFrom January 2002 to August 2004, LABF was performed successfully in 20 of 22 patients. The age of the patients ranged from 49 to 75 years, with 11 male and 11 female subjects. LABF required a median duration of 267 minutes (range, 199 to 365 minutes) to complete. Median aortic cross-clamp time was 89.5 minutes (range, 64 to 14 minutes) with an aortic anastomotic time of 37 minutes (range, 30 to 56 minutes). Blood loss averaged 0.69 +/- 0.081 L. Median intensive care stay was 1 day, and hospital stay was 4 days. The median duration of postoperative intravenous narcotics via patient-controlled analgesia pump was 2 days. No patients received epidural analgesia. Nearly all patients began a liquid diet 1 day and a solid diet 4 days after surgery. Complications occurred early in our experience and included one death secondary to mesenteric infarction possibly caused by excessive visceral traction. There was one pelvic abscess, one ureteral injury, and two limb occlusions necessitating thrombectomy and revision. The last six patients had uneventful operative procedures and recoveries. Of the two LABF failures, one patient required open conversion because of inadequate aortic exposure and the other required a short upper midline incision to complete the aortic anastomosis. Compared with conventional open aortobifemoral bypasses performed concomitantly during this period, selected LABF patients required fewer narcotics, experienced less bowel dysfunction, and were discharged home sooner.\nAortobifemoral bypass can be performed through a minimally invasive laparoscopic approach. Although technically demanding with a steep learning curve, experience should reduce the significant complication rate. Compared with a conventional open aortobifemoral bypass, advantages include less pain, minimal postoperative bowel dysfunction, and a shorter hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that an increase in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth rate occurs when the diameter reaches 40 to 50 mm. AAA expansion is related to remodeling of the parietal extracellular matrix. The parietal mechanisms involved in this critical phase of sudden increase remain unexplained. Analysis of AAA wall movements and determination of AAA compliance may provide information about the constitution of the arterial wall. If a change in parietal wall motion somewhere between 40 and 50 mm could be shown, this would contribute to the understanding of the growth of AAA. Furthermore, it would provide a valuable additional parameter for AAA monitoring. This study had two aims: first, to evaluate the relationship between AAA compliance and maximum diameter using the tissue Doppler imaging system; and second, to test the hypothesis of a change in AAA behavior at around 45 mm in diameter.\nFifty-six patients with AAA (mean diameter, 39 mm) were prospectively investigated using the tissue Doppler imaging system, which provides information concerning arterial wall motion. Maximum mean segmental dilation (MMSD), segmental compliance, pressure strain elastic modulus (Ep), and stiffness were determined and related to the maximum diameter of AAA. Results After natural log transformation of all variables, there was a significant positive linear relationship between maximum diameter and both MMSD (P < .001) and segmental compliance (P < .001) but not with Ep or stiffness (P = .37 and .22, respectively). MMSD and segmental compliance were significantly higher in AAA > or = 45 mm than in AAA < 45 mm (P < .0002 and <. 004, respectively). Ep and stiffness tended to decrease in larger AAAs, but this was not statistically significant (P < .43 and .24, respectively). Dispersion of Ep and stiffness values seemed to be wider among AAA < 45 mm compared with those > or = 45 mm.\nCompliance parameters can easily be measured during routine AAA ultrasound monitoring using the tissue Doppler imaging system. The study showed an increase in MMSD and segmental compliance as well as a nonsignificant trend toward increased distensibility (decreased Ep and stiffness) with increased AAA diameter. A change in dispersion of AAA distensibility may appear around 45 mm in diameter, but a larger study will be needed to clarify this.",

    "abstract": "Neurologic deficit after endovascular treatment of the thoracic aorta is a complication reported with variable frequency that may be associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of spinal cord ischemia appears to be multifactorial and remains ill-defined. We reviewed our experience to investigate the determinants of paraplegia after stent-graft repair of the thoracic aorta, identify patients at risk, and assess the effectiveness of ancillary techniques.\nOver a 5-year period (June 1999 to December 2004), 103 patients underwent elective endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta at a university referral center. Indications for treatment were atherosclerotic aneurysms in 88 patients, chronic type B dissection in 10 patients, and penetrating aortic ulcer in 5 patients. Four of the 103 patients affected with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms had hybrid procedures and were excluded from the cumulative analysis. Twelve patients with zone 0 and zone 1 aortic arch aneurysms were operated on with synchronous or staged surgical aortic debranching. Preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage was instituted in seven selected patients. Neurologic deficits were assessed by an independent neurologist and classified as immediate or delayed. Patient demographics and perioperative factors related to the endovascular procedure were evaluated by using univariate statistical analyses.\nA primary technical success was achieved in 94 patients (94.9%). At a mean follow-up of 34 +/- 14 months, a midterm clinical success was obtained in 90 patients (90.9%). Four patients (4.04%) had delayed neurologic deficit that completely resolved after the institution of CSF drainage, steroids administration, and arterial pressure pharmacologic adjustment. None of the four patients who underwent hybrid procedures for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms had paraplegia or paraparesis. Univariate analyses identified only a perioperative lowest mean arterial pressure (MAP) of <70 mm Hg as a significant risk factor (P < .0001).\nPerioperative hypotension (MAP <70 mm Hg) was found to be a significant predictor of spinal cord ischemia; hence, careful monitoring and prompt correction of arterial pressure may prevent the development of paraplegia. When the latter occurred, reduction of the CSF pressure by drainage was useful. Patients with a previous or synchronous abdominal aortic repair may also benefit from CSF drainage as a perioperative adjunct.",

The registry contains data on 2,664 EG patients and 334 open surgical control (SC) patients collected under four multicenter Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical trials that lead to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval with mandatory 5-year follow-up. Primary outcome measures include operative mortality, AAA-related death, all-cause mortality, aneurysm rupture, and surgical conversion.\nPooled data from IDE clinical trials revealed that EG patients were 3 years older (73 +/- 8 years) than SC patients (70 +/- 8 years, P < .01) and had significantly more cardiac comorbidities before treatment. However, there was no difference in 30-day operative mortality between EG (1.7%) and SC (1.4%) (P = .72). Both EG and SC were successful in preventing rupture, with freedom from aneurysm rupture in 99.8% of EG and 100% of SC patients at 1 year (P = .51). Freedom from rupture remained at 99% in years 1 to 6 after EG, with no increasing risk of late rupture. There was no significant difference in the AAA-related death rate at 1 year between EG (98.2%) and SC (98.6%) (P = .64). Freedom from AAA-related death remained at 98% in years 1 to 6 after EG, with no increasing risk of late AAA-related death. Kaplan-Meier analysis at 6 years revealed freedom from aneurysm rupture in 99%, freedom from AAA-related death in 98%, and freedom from surgical conversion in 95% of EG patients. There was no difference in survival at 4 years between EG (74%) and SC (71%) (P = .49). Overall EG patient survival at 5 years was 66% and at 6 years was 52%. Women had a higher risk of rupture (2.4%) than men (1.2%) (P = .01) and a higher rate of surgical conversion (8.3%) than men (3.8%) (P < .01) but had the same low AAA-related death rate (3.5%) as men (2.1%) (P = .16) at 5 years. Most secondary interventional procedures (85%) were performed < or =30 days after EVAR. Freedom from secondary intervention was 84% at 1 year and 78% at 5 years.\nEndovascular aneurysm repair using FDA-approved devices is a safe, effective, and durable treatment for anatomically suited patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

There was no difference in survival at 4 years between EG (74%) and SC (71%) (P = .49). Overall EG patient survival at 5 years was 66% and at 6 years was 52%. Women had a higher risk of rupture (2.4%) than men (1.2%) (P = .01) and a higher rate of surgical conversion (8.3%) than men (3.8%) (P < .01) but had the same low AAA-related death rate (3.5%) as men (2.1%) (P = .16) at 5 years. Most secondary interventional procedures (85%) were performed < or =30 days after EVAR. Freedom from secondary intervention was 84% at 1 year and 78% at 5 years.",

Their management is technically challenging because of the distorted anatomy and intimate relation to the lower cranial nerves. We present a rare case of a 7-year-old boy referred to us by a pediatrician who was treating him for bacterial endocarditis. The pulsatile swelling measured 10 x 5 cm and was located in the left suboccipital triangle. The skin over the swelling was tethered to the underlying pulsatile swelling, suggesting prerupture syndrome. A contrast angiogram revealed a pseudoaneurysm from the third part of the left vertebral artery. Vegetations were seen on the tricuspid valve on echocardiography. Two-step surgery was performed under the cover of antibiotics. Excision of the aneurysm was done after ligation of the third part of the vertebral artery. The postoperative period was uneventful, and there was no neurologic deficit. Repeat magnetic resonance angiogram revealed no residual pseudoaneurysm. The histopathologic examination of the specimen was suggestive of mycotic aneurysm of left vertebral artery.",

A medial visceral rotation was performed to gain good vascular control and subsequently the aneurysm was ligated from within. A systematic review was carried out, allowing us to analyze 12 cases of giant SAAs >10 cm published to date. The difference in terms of demographics, clinical presentation, and arterial location between the giant SAA group and usual SAAs may indicate a different underlying physiopathology that remains unclear at this time.",

These studies were designed to determine whether the cytokines responsible for remote tissue injury are also synthesized and accumulate in the ischemic or reperfused hind limb.\nB6, 129SF2/J mice were subjected to either 3 hours of unilateral hind limb ischemia alone (IA) or 3 hours of ischemia followed by 4 or 24 hours of reperfusion (I/R). After IA or I/R, experimental and control (nonischemic) contralateral hind limbs were harvested for analysis of protein content, messenger RNA (mRNA), tissue edema, and viability.\nIA did not increase KC or MIP-2 mRNA or protein levels. In contrast, I/R resulted in a 15- and 10-fold increase in KC mRNA after 4 and 24 hours of reperfusion, respectively. KC protein levels were increased 10-fold after 4 hours of reperfusion and 30-fold after 24 hours (vs IA or sham; P < .001). MIP-2 mRNA transiently increased 42-fold after 4 hours of reperfusion but decreased to basal levels after 24 hours of reperfusion. Despite the relative increase in MIP-2 mRNA by 4 hours of reperfusion, significantly increased (8- to 10 fold) MIP-2 protein levels were not detected until 24 hours of reperfusion only in the reperfused limbs. Tissue edema was increased significantly (P < .01) compared with sham after just 4 hours of reperfusion and remained increased at 24 hours. Tissue viability decreased 52% after 4 hours of reperfusion and did not change significantly by 24 hours.\nSkeletal muscle is a site of significant ongoing chemokine synthesis during reperfusion. The persistent increase in muscle chemokine levels at 24 hours of reperfusion was not associated with increased edema or injury. The role of these chemokines during reperfusion may be further investigated by local or oral administration of chemokines or chemokine receptor antagonists.\nI/R injury remains an important clinical problem across a variety of surgical specialties. In the critical care arena, serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been useful in predicting the mortality associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. In this article, the data presented indicate that murine skeletal muscle produces potent proinflammatory neutrophil and macrophage chemokines during reperfusion, but not during ischemia. These findings suggest that measurement of tissue and/or serum levels of chemokines during reperfusion may be an important adjunct to predicting tissue injury along with ongoing inflammation during the clinical course of reperfusion injury. Within the vascular system, severe inflammatory responses are usually associated with thrombotic events. New techniques to noninvasively image thrombin activation (by using magnetic resonance imaging) in reperfused limbs may coincide with the pattern of murine skeletal muscle chemokine expression in humans. The data suggest that reperfusion is when chemokine mRNA and protein synthesis increase. Within the time periods studied in these experiments, the chemokine component of the inflammatory response remained in the reperfused, rather than the systemic nonreperfused, tissue. This observation may underestimate the degree of the systemic response to ischemia because the single mouse hind limb represents only 7% of the mouse total body area, whereas the human limb represents nearly 18% of the adult body area. Despite this shortcoming, these data provide potential temporal and quantitative information regarding the location and magnitude of chemokine synthesis in skeletal muscle during reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "P-selectin inhibition with protein therapeutics such as antibodies or soluble ligands given intravenously can decrease thrombosis in a mouse ligation model of venous thrombosis. In this study, we hypothesized that oral inhibition of P selectin with a novel oral nonprotein inhibitor (PSI-697) would decrease thrombosis and circulating microparticle populations. This study evaluated the effects on thrombosis and circulating microparticle populations in this murine venous thrombosis model.\nMice underwent inferior vena cava ligation to induce thrombosis. Mice with high circulating level of P selectin, Delta Cytoplasmic Tail (CT), mice gene-deleted for both E- and P-selectin knockout (EPKO), and wild-type C57BL/6 mice (WT) were studied without and with administration of PSI-697 in food (100 mg/kg daily) from 2 days before thrombosis until the end of the study. Animals were killed 2 and 6 days later. Evaluations included thrombus weight (TW), vein wall morphometrics, microparticle quantification by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and vein wall enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for interleukin (IL)-10, P selectin, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1.\nPSI-697 significantly decreased TW in WT and CT mice, with a treated vs nontreated TW of 132 +/- 24 vs 228 +/- 29 x 10(-4) g (P = .014) and 166 +/- 19 vs 281 +/- 16 x 10(-4) g (P = .001), respectively. At day 6, the effect was significant only in the CT group (P < .05). Drug therapy at day 2 significantly increased vein wall monocytes in WT mice and increased monocytes and total inflammatory cells in CT animals. A significant decrease in neutrophils and total inflammatory cells was seen in EPKO mice at day 2 with therapy. Therapy significantly increased platelet-derived microparticles and total microparticles in CT mice on day 2. Changes in treated WT and treated EPKO animals were not significant compared with respective vehicle treatments at day 2. On day 6, therapy significantly decreased total microparticles in EPKO animals. Vein wall expression of IL-10 increased in all groups with therapy at day 2 (n = 18) and was significantly increased in WT (2687.5 +/- 903 pg/mL vs 636 +/- 108 pg/mL total protein; P = .038) and CT (2078 +/- 295 pg/mL vs 432 +/- 62 pg/mL total protein; P = .001) mice. Therapy significantly decreased vein wall P selectin, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and IL-10 levels at day 6.\nPSI-697 decreased thrombosis. P-selectin inhibition allowed vein wall inflammatory cell extravasation in this model of complete ligation. Circulating microparticles (platelet-derived microparticles and total microparticles) increased with P-selectin inhibition, possibly because of decreased consumption into the thrombus. In summary, the oral administration of an inhibitor to P selectin provides significant TW reduction.\nDeep venous thrombosis is a significant national health problem in the general population. The average annual incidence of deep venous thrombosis is approximately 250,000 cases per year. The selectin family of adhesion molecules is thought to be largely responsible for the initial attachment and rolling of leukocytes on stimulated vascular endothelium. Recent studies have explored the possible therapeutic implications of P-selectin inhibition to modulate venous thrombosis. For example, prophylactic dosing of a recombinant P-selectin ligand decreases venous thrombosis in a dose-dependent fashion in both feline and nonhuman primate animal models. Additionally, treatment of 2-day iliac thrombi with a recombinant protein, P-selectin inhibitor, significantly improves vein reopening in nonhuman primates. It is interesting to note that P-selectin inhibition decreases thrombosis without adverse anticoagulation. On the basis of the results from these previous studies, the use of P-selectin antagonism is a logical therapeutic approach to treat venous thrombosis. All inhibitors developed to date are either proteins or small molecules with low oral bioavailability that require intravenous or subcutaneous injection. This study evaluates, for the first time, a novel orally bioavailable inhibitor of P-selectin (PSI-697).",

    "abstract": "The clinical significance and treatment of retrograde collateral arterial perfusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms after endovascular repair (type II endoleak) have not been completely characterized. A canine abdominal aortic aneurysm model of type II endoleak with an implanted pressure transducer was used to evaluate the use of polyurethane foam to induce thrombosis of type II endoleaks. The effect on endoleak patency, intra-aneurysmal pressure, and thrombus histology was studied.\nProsthetic aneurysms with an intraluminal, solid-state, strain-gauge pressure transducer were created in the infrarenal aorta of 14 mongrel dogs. Aneurysm side-branch vessels were reimplanted into the prosthetic aneurysm of 10 animals by using a Carrel patch. Type II (retrograde) endoleaks were created by excluding the aneurysm from antegrade perfusion with an impermeable stent graft. Thrombosis of the type II endoleak was induced by implantation of polyurethane foam into the prosthetic aneurysm sac of four animals. Six animals with type II endoleaks were not treated. In four control animals, no collateral side branches were reimplanted, and therefore no endoleak was created. Intra-aneurysmal and systemic pressures were measured daily for 60 to 90 days after the implantation of the stent graft. Endoleak patency and flow were assessed during surgery and at the time of death by using angiographic imaging and duplex ultrasonography. Histologic analysis of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus was also performed.\nIntra-aneurysmal pressure values are indexed to systemic pressure and are represented as a percentage of the simultaneously obtained systemic pressure, which has a value of 1.0. All six animals with untreated type II endoleaks maintained patency of the endoleak and side-branch arteries throughout the study period. Compared with control aneurysms that had no endoleak, animals with patent type II endoleaks exhibited significantly higher intra-aneurysmal pressurization (systolic pressure: patent type II endoleak, 0.702 +/- 0.283; control, 0.172 +/- 0.091; P < .001; mean pressure: endoleak, 0.784 +/- 0.229; control, 0.137 +/- 0.102; P < .001; pulse pressure: endoleak, 0.406 +/- 0.248; control, 0.098 +/- 0.077; P < .001; P < .001 for comparison for all groups by analysis of variance). Treatment of the type II endoleak with polyurethane foam induced thrombosis of the endoleak and feeding side-branch arteries in all four animals with type II endoleaks. This resulted in intra-aneurysmal pressures statistically indistinguishable from the controls (systolic pressure, 0.183 +/- 0.08; mean pressure, 0.142 +/- 0.09; pulse pressure, 0.054 +/- 0.04; not significant). Angiography and histology documented persistent patency up to the time of death (mean, 64 days) for untreated type II endoleaks and confirmed thrombosis of polyurethane foam-treated endoleaks in all cases.\nUntreated type II endoleaks were associated with intra-aneurysmal pressures that were 70% to 80% of systemic pressure. Treatment with polyurethane foam resulted in a reduction of intra-aneurysmal pressure to a level that was indistinguishable from control aneurysms that had no endoleak.\nEndovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is dependent on the successful exclusion of the aneurysm from arterial circulation. Type II endoleaks originate from retrograde flow into the aneurysm sac. This study demonstrates the use of polyurethane foam to induce thrombosis in a canine model of a type II endoleak, thereby reducing intra-aneurysmal pressure to levels similar to levels in animals without endoleaks. This approach may be a strategy for future treatment of type II endoleaks.",

Sixty-one legs had no PVI preoperatively, 5 (8%) had PVI at 2 months, and 11 (18%) had PVI at 2 years. In the group of 251 legs, reversal of PVI between 2 months and 2 years was found in 28 (41%) of 68 and was more common than new PVI, which occurred in 41 (22%) of 183 (P = .003). After 2 years, the number of legs without venous incompetence in which perforator surgery was not performed was 11 (26%) of 42 legs with preoperative PVI and 18 (30%) of 61 legs without preoperative PVI, (P = .713). After 2 years, new vessel formation was more common in the surgically obliterated saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ), 4 (40%) of 10, than in the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ), 17 (11%) of 151(P = .027), and new incompetence in a previously normal junction was more common in the SFJ, 11 (18%) of 63, than in the SPJ, 3 (1%) of 226 (P < .001). Reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV) below the knee was abolished after stripping above the knee in 17 (34%) of 50 legs at 2 months and in 22 legs (44%) after 2 years.\nVaricose vein surgery induces changes in the remaining venous segments of the legs that continue for several months. In most patients, perforators and the GSV below the knee can be ignored at the primary surgery. A substantial number of recurrences in the SFJ and SPJ are unavoidable with present surgical knowledge because they stem from new vessel formation and progression of disease.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous disease (CVD) is the most common vascular disorder, progressing in approximately 10% of cases toward chronic venous leg ulceration, whereas the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) C282Y mutation is the most common recognized genetic defect in iron metabolism. Because CVD leads to local iron overload in the affected legs, we investigated whether two common HFE mutations could increase the risk of chronic venous leg ulceration.\nThis was a case-control study at the Vascular Diseases Center, University of Ferrara, Italy. From a cohort of 980 consecutive patients affected by severe CVD (CEAP clinical classes C4 to C6) we selected 238 cases with the exclusion of any other comorbidity factor potentially involved in wound etiology (group A). They were subdivided into group B, including 137 patients with ulcer (classes C5 and C6: 98 primary and 39 postthrombotic cases), and group C, including 101 cases with no skin lesions (class C4). They were completely matched for sex, age, and geographic origin with 280 healthy controls (group D). A total of 518 subjects were polymerase chain reaction genotyped for HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D). We assessed the risk of ulceration by comparing the prevalence of ulcer in homogenous cases with and without the HFE variants. Other main outcome measures were the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the genetic test in CVD cases.\nC282Y mutation significantly increases the risk of ulcer in primary CVD by almost seven times (odds ratio, 6.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-30.8; P = .01). Application of the HFE test in primary CVD demonstrated increased specificity and positive predictive values (98% and 86%, respectively), with negligible sensitivity and negative predictive values.\nThe overlap of primary CVD and the C282Y mutation consistently increases the risk of developing venous leg ulceration. These data, which have been confirmed in other clinical settings, suggest new strategies for preventing and treating primary CVD.\nThe number of patients affected by primary CVD is so great that the vast majority of ulcers are also related to this common problem. On the other hand, there is not a reliable way for identifying in advance, from the broad base of primary CVD patients (20-40% of the general population), the high risk minority (10% of primary CVD cases) who will develop a venous ulcer. In such cases, a simple C282Y blood genetic test demonstrated an elevated specificity in predicting ulcer development (98%, CI 95%, 92.8-99.7). The genetic test could be applied starting from the C2 class, varicose veins, the most common situation observed in clinical practice. In perspective, the presence of the C282Y mutation would strengthen the indications and priorities for surgical correction of superficial venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Venous ulcers represent an important medical problem because of their high prevalence and consequent sanitary costs. In this study, we evaluated the effect of prostaglandin E-1 (PGE-1), a drug that improves district ischemia, on the healing of venous ulcers.\nWe performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, single blind study in which 87 patients who had venous leg ulcers homogeneous for dimensions and characteristics were treated for 20 days with an infusion of prostaglandin E-1 or placebo, in association with topical therapy. The dimension and the number of the ulcers were determined at the beginning of the treatment and then every 20 days up to 4 months, or until total recovery. The main outcome of the study was the recovery percentage of the ulcers at the end of the 120-day period of observation and the referred healing time. The reduction in the extension of ulcers from the baseline measurement to the last observation was also evaluated.\nThe baseline characteristics of the treatment and control groups were similar. The reduction in the size of the ulcers was faster in the patients treated with PGE-1. In this group, 100% of the ulcers healed < or = 100 days, whereas in the placebo group, only 84.2% did so by the end of the 120-day observation period (P < .05). The estimated healing times of 25%, 50%, and 75% of the patients treated with PGE-1 were 23, 49, and 72 days, respectively, compared with 52, 80, and 108 for the patients in the placebo group. Only one serious event occurred in the treated group.\nThis study demonstrates the effectiveness of PGE-1 in reducing the healing time of venous ulcers, suggesting that venous ulcers should also be considered ischemic.",

    "abstract": "It has been previously shown that the SCD Response Compression System, by sensing the postcompression refill time of the lower limbs, delivers more compression cycles over time, resulting in as much as a 76% increase in the total volume of blood expelled per hour. Extended indications for pneumatic compression have necessitated the introduction of portable devices. The aim of our study was to test the hemodynamic effectiveness of a new portable sequential compression system (the SCD Express), which has the ability to detect the individual refill time of the two lower limbs separately.\nThis was an open, controlled trial with 30 normal volunteers. The new SCD Express was compared with the SCD Response Compression System in the supine and semirecumbent positions. The refilling time sensed by the device was compared with that determined from velocity recordings of the superficial femoral vein using duplex ultrasonography. Baseline and augmented flow velocity and volume flow, including the total volume of blood expelled per hour during compression with the SCD Express, were compared with those produced by the SCD Response compression system in the same volunteers and positions.\nBoth devices significantly increased venous flow velocity as much as 2.26 times baseline in supine position and 2.67 times baseline in semirecumbent position (all P < .001). There was a linear relationship between duplex ultrasonography-derived refill time and the SCD Express-derived refill time in both the supine (r = 0.39, P = .03) and semirecumbent (r = 0.71, P < .001) positions but not with the SCD Response. Refill time measured by the SCD Express device was significantly shorter and the cycle rate higher in comparison with the SCD Response in both positions. The single-cycle flow velocity and volume flow parameters generated by the two devices were similar in both positions. However, median (interquartile range) total volume of blood expelled per hour was slightly higher with the SCD Express device in the supine position (7206 mL/h [range, 5042-8437] vs 6712 mL/h [4941-10,676]; P = .85) and semirecumbent position (4588 mL/h [range, 3721-6252] vs 4262 mL/h [3520-5831]; P = .22). Peak volume of blood expelled per hour by the SCD Express device in the semirecumbent position was significantly increased by 10% in comparison with the SCD Response (P = .03).\nFlow velocity and volume flow enhancement by the SCD Response and SCD Express were essentially similar. The latter, a portable device with optional battery power that detects the individual refill time of the lower limbs separately, is anticipated to be associated with improved overall compliance and therefore optimized thromboprophylaxis. Studies testing its potential for improved efficacy in preventing deep vein thrombosis are justified.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent vascular access failure is a major cause of morbidity in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis. Central venous catheters are often necessary for dialysis, and easily accessed vessels (ie, the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein) frequently occlude because of repeated cannulation. When standard access sites occlude, unconventional access methods become necessary. We report a technique of placing hemodialysis catheters directly into the superior vena cava (SVC).\nBetween January 2002 and December 2004, 22 patients with documented bilateral jugular and subclavian vein occlusion underwent transthoracic SVC permanent catheter placement. Femoral vein access was obtained, and a sheath was placed. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a diagnostic catheter was then inserted into the SVC, and a venogram was obtained. By using the fluoroscopic image as a reference guide, supraclavicular access directly into the SVC was performed with lateral and anteroposterior views to better localize the SVC. Once venous blood was obtained, a hydrophilic wire was passed into the inferior vena cava. A 5F sheath was then placed, and, with the use of an exchange catheter, the wire was switched for a stiffer wire. The hemodialysis catheter was then placed in the standard fashion over this wire.\nIn a 24-month period, 22 patients underwent transthoracic permanent catheter placement. All patients had the permanent catheters successfully inserted. Two major complications occurred. One patient experienced a pneumothorax, and another patient experienced a hemothorax. Both patients were successfully treated with chest tube decompression. All permanent catheters functioned immediately with a range of 1 to 7 months.\nTransthoracic permanent catheter placement is an appropriate alternative for patients in whom traditional venous access sites are no longer available.",

    "abstract": "This study compares early results of video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy (VTS) at the thoracic T2 versus T3 ganglion denervation levels for the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis (PH).\nSixty patients with PH were prospectively randomized for VTS at the thoracic T2 or T3 ganglion denervation levels. The patients underwent postoperative evaluation on three occasions: before surgery, and 1 and 6 months after the operation. Endpoints included the absence of PH, the presence, location, and severity of compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH), and a quality-of-life assessment.\nFifty-nine of 60 patients reported complete resolution of PH after surgery. One failure occurred in the T3 group. CH was observed in 26 patients (86.66%) in the T2 group and in 27 patients (90%) in the T3 group at 1 month. At 6 months, 30 of 30 patients in the T2 group and 29 of 30 in the T3 group experienced CH, although in the T3 group, CH was less severe at both 1 and 6 months (P < .05). Quality of life was very poor in both groups before surgery. One month after operation, quality of life was improved similarly in both groups. This improvement was maintained at 6 months in both groups.\nPH is well treated by VTS at either the T2 or T3 levels. Denervation at the T3 level appears associated with less severe CH in the early postoperative period. Quality of life improved significantly in both groups.",

    "abstract": "Compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery is a rare but possibly underestimated condition. Surgical correction (42 cases reported in the literature) can be performed by means of a variety of different techniques. Although endovascular stenting is well accepted for iliocaval occlusive disease, it has been poorly evaluated in this indication. We describe five patients who were treated for nutcracker syndrome by using stenting and analyze the nine cases previously reported.\nFrom November 2002 to September 2004, five women (mean age, 34.7 years) were admitted for endovascular treatment of a nutcracker syndrome. They all had incapacitating pelvic congestion syndrome, including two with a history of left ovarian vein embolization; moreover, two had left lumbar pain, and three had hematuria. The mean preoperative venous disability score was 2.4. The patients underwent a gynecologic examination and laparoscopy to eliminate other causes of pelvic pain. The laparoscopy revealed large pelvic varicose veins and no signs of endometriosis. Duplex scan, computed tomographic scan, and iliocavography revealed left renal vein compression, with proximal distention and collateral pathways, with dilatation and permanent reflux in the left ovarian vein in the three patients who had not had prior embolization. The mean renocaval pullback gradient was 4.3 mm Hg. A percutaneous endovascular procedure, during in which a self-expanding metallic stent was implanted, was performed under general anaesthesia.\nTechnical success was achieved in all cases. One case of stent migration occurred: the stent was pulled down in the inferior vena cava, with uneventful follow-up (mean, 14.3 months). One month later, patients were all improved and stents were patent at the duplex scan examination, without restenosis. The mean venous disability score was 1. No further left ovarian vein reflux was evident at duplex scan in patients who did not have prior embolization. Pelvic pain recurred in one patient who had initially improved, and endometriosis was diagnosed 15 months after the procedure. Two other patients, who received 40-mm-long stents, had a secondary recurrence of the symptoms caused by stent dislodgement. The two other patients were asymptomatic.\nThis study shows that stenting is feasible, but some guidelines should be followed, mainly the use of long stents protruding into the inferior vena cava. Stenting can eliminate the symptoms of the condition, and the technique is only very slightly invasive. Further experience and follow-up are needed before accepting such a procedure for treatment of the nutcracker syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric stenting has not been widely adopted for the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). The recent availability of embolic protection and low-profile devices with the theoretical ability to decrease perioperative bowel necrosis, led us to begin using mesenteric stenting for patients with CMI. We review our initial experience to examine short-term outcomes.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who were treated by vascular surgeons with mesenteric stenting for CMI. Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia were excluded. We evaluated perioperative morbidity and mortality, restenosis, recurrent symptoms, and reintervention. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess events during follow-up. We also compared these outcomes with a historical control group of patients treated with open surgical revascularization.\nFourteen patients underwent mesenteric stenting over the past 3 years. Mean age was 73, and 64% were women. There was no perioperative or 30-day mortality or major morbidity. Early restenosis and recurrent symptoms occurred in 10% and 9% of patients at 6 months. At a mean follow-up of 13 months, 53% of patients underwent reintervention. However, 93% were symptom-free at their last follow-up. Compared with open surgery, stent patients had lower perioperative major morbidity (30% vs 0%, P < .01) and shorter hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (median 10 days vs 2 days, and 3 days vs 0 days, respectively, P < .01 for both). However, stent patients were seven times as likely to develop restenosis (P < .01), four times more likely to develop recurrent symptoms (P < .01), and 15 times more likely to undergo reintervention (P < .01). There was one death 13 months after stenting due to mesenteric infarction in a patient lost to follow-up. One patient was successfully converted to open surgery after a second restenosis. He had regained 20 pounds and was determined to be a better operative candidate than at his initial presentation. There was no perioperative or 30-day mortality or major morbidity with reintervention after mesenteric stenting.\nMesenteric stenting for CMI can be performed with low perioperative risk. However, stenting is associated with early restenosis and recurrent symptoms requiring secondary procedures. Patients with severe nutritional depletion or high surgical risk may benefit from mesenteric stenting for CMI, but close follow-up is required. Later open surgery can be performed for restenosis if nutritional status and surgical risk are improved, or repeat angioplasty and stenting can be effectively performed if operative risk remains high.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate levels as well as pH changes in exercising muscle at a workload of 4.5 W under progressive cuff stenoses, whereby the flow reduction due to cuff compression was quantified by flow-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging.\nBy using a whole-body 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner and an exercise bench, serial phosphorus 31 (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy with a time resolution of 30 seconds was performed in 10 healthy men. Percentage changes in PCr, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and pH were statistically evaluated in comparison with baseline. The exercise protocol was characterized by a constant workload level of 4.5 W. Ischemic conditions were achieved by a cuff that was placed at the upper leg. Consecutively, increments of 0, 60, 90, 120, and 150 mm Hg were applied. Each increment lasted for 3 minutes. The following rest period was 10 minutes.\nBlood flow increased significantly immediately after the onset of muscle exercise. No significant changes in blood flow were detected as long as the air pressure of the pneumatic cuff was 60 to 90 mm Hg. Significant reductions in blood flow were observed immediately after inflation of the cuff to 120 and 150 mm Hg. PCr passed into a steady state during the first increment with 0 mm Hg and showed no substantial changes during the increment with 60, 90, and 120 mm Hg. PCr hydrolysis seemed progressive during the 150-mm Hg increment. Pi passed into a plateau level at the onset of exercise and increased significantly at the increment of 150 mm Hg. The pH turned into a steady state with no significant changes during the increments up to 120 mm Hg. At 150 mm Hg, pH decreased progressively. PCr levels at the end of the 150-mm Hg increment correlated significantly and moderately with the reduction in blood flow.\nOur study shows that the ischemic condition during constant muscle exercise is clearly characterized by PCr and Pi kinetics, as well as by pH changes. The correlation between the degree of blood flow reduction and PCr levels in the exercising muscle groups, which are supplied by the stenosed arteries, is the first essential of using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the assessment of the effect of arterial stenoses on muscle function in claudicants.",

    "abstract": "Coagulation activation markers are significantly elevated in patients with peripheral arterial disease compared with healthy controls. The more severe the disease, the higher the markers. Increased coagulation activation may contribute to the disease process and the risk of complications in patients with peripheral arterial disease, particularly after endovascular intervention. Animal studies have shown that clopidogrel significantly inhibits coagulation activation. The aim of this study was to determine whether combination of aspirin and clopidogrel affects thrombin-antithrombin III and D-dimer in patients with intermittent claudication undergoing angioplasty, compared with aspirin alone.\nThis was a double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted in a vascular unit in a tertiary referral center. One hundred thirty-two patients with intermittent claudication were randomized to clopidogrel and aspirin or placebo and aspirin, with a loading dose 12 hours before endovascular intervention. D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, 1 hour before, and 1 hour, 24 hours, and 30 days after intervention in 103 patients who underwent endovascular intervention.\nThere was a significant rise in D-dimer levels at 1 hour and 24 hours after angioplasty in both groups (placebo group: 63.69, 141.45, 122.18 ng/mL; clopidogrel group: 103.79, 159.95, 134.69 ng/mL), but no difference between the two groups (P = .514). Similarly there was a significant rise in TAT levels at 1 hour after angioplasty in both groups (placebo group: 2.93, 6.16 microg/L; clopidogrel group: 3.39, 5.27 microg/L), with no significant difference between the two groups (P = .746).\nEndovascular intervention results in a significant increase in TAT and D-dimer. The addition of clopidogrel to aspirin has no effect on TAT and D-dimer before or after endovascular intervention.",

    "abstract": "Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) has proven to be an independent marker of the extent of atherosclerosis in patients with coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease. In this prospective observational study, we wanted to assess the relationship between serum CRP and extent of disease transversely and longitudinally in time, as well as future cardiovascular complications in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Hypothesizing that CRP not only is a marker of but also actively participates in atherogenesis, we explored the possibility of CRP production by femoral atherosclerotic plaques.\nSerum CRP was measured as highly sensitive (hsCRP) in 387 patients with PAD attending the vascular clinic of a university and 2 affiliated teaching hospitals. Serum hsCRP was related to the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) as an indication of severity of disease at inclusion and at 12 months' follow-up and to future events (death and coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial events). In femoral plaques, the production of CRP was analyzed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and CRP plaque localization was assessed with immunostaining on serial tissue sections with antibodies toward CRP, smooth muscle cells, T cells, and macrophages.\nThe hsCRP (average +/- SD) was 3.26 +/- 2.41 mg/L. Serum hsCRP showed a correlation with baseline and 12-month follow-up ABPI (Spearman rank correlation; P < .05 for both correlations). When the patients were divided into three equally sized groups according to baseline serum hsCRP, the ABPI at baseline and at 12 months decreased significantly from the low- to the high-hsCRP group (baseline ABPI: 0.70, 0.65, and 0.57, P < .01; 12-month follow-up ABPI: 0.78, 0.70, and 0.65, P < .01). These associations persisted after correction for conventional risk factors. Furthermore, serum hsCRP was related to the combined end point \"death and/or any cardiovascular event\" (log-rank test; P = .04) during a median 24-month follow-up period. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed CRP production in 4 of 14 femoral plaques. CRP was detected in all femoral plaques, but not in healthy brachial arteries. Immunoreactivity for CRP was observed in smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and T cells.\nSerum hsCRP was related to the severity of PAD, showing a relation to future hemodynamic function and cardiovascular events in PAD patients. In addition to coronary plaques, aneurysmal aortas, and failed venous coronary bypasses, femoral plaques also produce CRP, thus illustrating that the production of CRP may represent a universal response to vascular injury and suggesting that vascular CRP may contribute to plaque development.",

The waveforms were then compared with the findings of magnetic resonance angiography of the aortoiliac segment and peripheral runoff vessels. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of the duplex waveform for detecting >50% obstructive disease of the aortoiliac segment and determined the observer agreement for classifying the duplex waveforms done by two independent observers.\nMagnetic resonance angiography showed obstruction in 152 (39.9%) of 381 aortoiliac segments in 191 patients.

    "abstract": "Despite being a major determinant of functional independence, ambulation after major limb amputation has not been well studied. The purpose, therefore, of this study was to investigate the relationship between a variety of preoperative clinical characteristics and postoperative functional outcomes in order to formulate treatment recommendations for patients requiring major lower limb amputation.\nFrom January 1998 through December 2003, 627 major limb amputations (37.6% below knee amputations, 4.3% through knee amputations, 34.5% above knee amputations, and 23.6% bilateral amputations) were performed on 553 patients. Their mean age was 63.7 years; 55% were men, 70.2% had diabetes mellitus, and 91.5% had peripheral vascular disease. A retrospective review was performed correlating various preoperative presenting factors such as age at presentation, race, medical comorbidities, preoperative ambulatory status, and preoperative independent living status, with postoperative functional endpoints of prosthetic usage, survival, maintenance of ambulation, and maintenance of independent living status. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and compared by using the log-rank test. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals were constructed by using multiple logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards models.\nStatistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with not wearing a prosthesis in order of greatest to least risk were nonambulatory before amputation (OR, 9.5), above knee amputation (OR, 4.4), age > 60 years (OR, 2.7), homebound but ambulatory status (OR, 3.0), presence of dementia (OR, 2.4), end-stage renal disease (OR, 2.3), and coronary artery disease (OR, 2.0). Statistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with death in decreasing order of influence included age > or = 70 years (HR, 3.1), age 60 to 69 (HR, 2.5), and the presence of coronary artery disease (HR, 1.5). Statistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with failure of ambulation in decreasing order of influence included age > or = 70 years (HR, 2.3), age 60 to 69 (HR, 1.6), bilateral amputation (HR, 1.8), and end-stage renal disease (HR, 1.4). Statistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with failure to maintain independent living status in decreasing order of influence included age > or = 70 years (HR, 4.0), age 60 to 69 (HR, 2.7), level of amputation (HR, 1.8), homebound ambulatory status (HR, 1.6), and the presence of dementia (HR, 1.6).\nPatients with limited preoperative ambulatory ability, age > or = 70, dementia, end-stage renal disease, and advanced coronary artery disease perform poorly and should probably be grouped with bedridden patients, who traditionally have been best served with a palliative above knee amputation. Conversely, younger healthy patients with below knee amputations achieved functional outcomes similar to what might be expected after successful lower extremity revascularization. Amputation in these instances should probably not be considered a failure of therapy but another treatment option capable of extending functionality and independent living.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery bifurcation reconstruction after endarterectomy has been refined over the years. Methods including primary closure, patch closure, and eversion endarterectomy have been proven to be durable. However, there are patients who require more complicated reconstructions in primary or recurrent disease management. Carotid replacement with a prosthetic interposition graft is potentially a durable option to reconstruct an artery that is technically unsuitable for primary or patch closure.\nThe charts of all carotid endarterectomies (n = 482) performed by the authors at our institution between January 1999 and December 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up was performed in an Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories-accredited vascular laboratory. Patients were divided into two main groups: carotid replacement with 6-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) (REP) or standard endarterectomy (CEA) with or without patch closure. The decision for REP vs CEA (as well as the type of closure) was at the discretion of the surgeon according to an assessment of the end point, the distal internal carotid artery, and the quality and length of the endarterectomy segment. Interposition grafting with a 6-mm stretch of ePTFE from the transected common carotid to the transected internal carotid artery was performed in replacement reconstruction. The external carotid was ligated. Follow-up statistical analyses were performed with the Fisher exact test and analysis of variance for nominal values and t tests for continuous variables. Life table analyses were performed for patency and survival.\nComplete perioperative data were available for 478 of the 482 operations performed (including all REP cases) during the study. At least one duplex ultrasound scan in follow-up was documented in 84% (n = 402) of the patients. A total of 51 were in the REP group, and 427 received CEA (95.3% with patch closure). Preoperative demographics, preoperative symptoms, and degree of stenosis did not vary within the study groups. Three 30-day surgical deaths occurred. The perioperative stroke rate between groups was not statistically different (REP, 1/51 [1.9%]; CEA, 3/427 [0.70%]; P = .35). Long-term patency and stroke-free survival rates at 3 years exceeded 96% and did not vary significantly between groups. The presence of a patch in the CEA group had no influence on outcomes. Duplex follow-up scan averaged two studies for at least 14 months in each group. Significantly more REP cases were reoperative procedures.\nCarotid interposition reconstruction with an ePTFE graft is an acceptable alternative in cases in which the standard technique would be technically difficult or compromising to the endarterectomy closure. Carotid ePTFE interposition graft replacement seems to be safe and durable and to have no increased perioperative risk or altered intermediate-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Current clinical trials evaluating carotid stenting have focused on high-risk patients and may not reflect the broad population of patients with carotid stenosis who undergo treatment to prevent stroke. The Carotid Revascularization Using Endarterectomy or Stenting Systems (CaRESS) phase I study is a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized trial designed to address the question of whether carotid stenting (CAS) with cerebral protection is comparable to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis.\nPatients with symptomatic (with >50% stenosis) or asymptomatic (with >75% stenosis) carotid stenosis were entered into the study in a 2:1 ratio of carotid stent and GuardWire Plus distal protection device. This unique trial model was developed through collaboration with the International Society of Endovascular Specialists, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Institutes of Health, and industry representatives. The primary end points included death and stroke at 30 days and a composite 1-year end point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) from 0 to 30 days and death or stroke from 31 days to 1 year. The secondary end points included residual stenosis, restenosis, repeat angiography, and carotid revascularization at 30 days and 1 year and quality-of-life changes at 1 year.\nA total of 397 patients (254 CEA and 143 CAS) were enrolled in the study: 32% were symptomatic and 68% were asymptomatic. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, symptoms, or surgical risk profiles between groups at baseline. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant differences in combined death/stroke rates at 30 days (3.6% CEA vs 2.1% CAS) or at 1 year (13.6% CEA vs 10.0% CAS). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the combined end point of death, stroke, or MI at 30 days (4.4% CEA vs 2.1% CAS) or at 1 year (14.3% CEA vs 10.9% CAS). There were no significant differences between CEA and CAS in the secondary end points of residual stenosis (0% CEA vs 0.9% CAS), restenosis (3.6% CEA vs 6.3% CAS), repeat angiography (2.1% CEA vs 3.6% CAS), carotid revascularization (1.0% CEA vs 1.8% CAS), or change in quality of life (-1.56 points CEA vs -4.22 points CAS).\nThe CaRESS phase I study suggests that the 30-day and 1-year risk of death, stroke, or MI with CAS is equivalent to that with CEA in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Clinically evident renal disease (dialysis, history of renal insufficiency, or serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL) is a known risk factor for mortality after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. We extended this concept to the questions of whether subclinical renal disease is also a risk factor and how best to identify subclinical disease. We hypothesized that the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) would be a more sensitive determinant of renal function than serum creatinine alone.\nBetween 1991 and 2004, we repaired 1106 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. The median age was 67 years. There were 400 (36%) women and 706 (64%) men. We estimated GFR by using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. We divided baseline serum creatinine and baseline GFR into quartiles and estimated the association of the quartiles with 30-day postoperative mortality by chi2 testing. We further subdivided the population into patients with and without clinically evident renal disease and repeated the analysis in the patients without clinically apparent disease (n = 869).\nClinically apparent renal disease was highly associated with 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 3.2; P < .0001). In all patients, serum creatinine quartile and GFR quartile were also both highly significantly associated with 30-day mortality (P < .0001). In patients without clinically apparent renal disease, both creatinine and GFR predicted additional mortality, but GFR was a much stronger predictor (P < .02 for creatinine vs < .0001 for GFR). In these patients, mortality ranged from 5% in the best GFR quartile to 27% in the worst. Taken as continuous variables in logistic regression equations, serum creatinine had no discrimination in patients without clinical disease (P = .73), whereas GFR remained strong (P < .0001).\nPreoperative renal function is an important determinant of early mortality even in patients without clinically evident disease. Estimated GFR is a much more powerful determinant of mortality risk than serum creatinine alone.",

    "abstract": "We prospectively studied the clinical implication of plasma level of soluble fibrin monomer (FM)-fibrinogen complex, a recently established molecular marker reflecting thrombin activity, in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) undergoing elective aortic repair.\nThe study included 49 patients who underwent elective aneurysm repair using a gelatin-sealed or nonimpregnated Dacron prosthesis. Plasma level of soluble FM-fibrinogen complex was measured before surgery and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 postoperatively by latex agglutination assay utilizing monoclonal antibody IF-43. Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), D-dimer, alpha2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex (PIC), and fibrinogen were also evaluated.\nThe preoperative level of soluble FM-fibrinogen complex showed variation in the degree of hemostatic activation, with fair correlations with TAT (r = 0.509, P < .001), D-dimer (r = 0.521, P < .001), and PIC (r = 0.579, P < .001). The patients with greater intraoperative blood loss (> or = 800 mL) showed a significantly elevated plasma level of soluble FM-fibrinogen complex preoperatively compared with those with less intraoperative blood loss (P = .009). Its postoperative fluctuation showed a similar pattern to that of TAT, reflecting the time course of coagulation activity. Gelatin impregnation of the Dacron vascular graft did not seem to influence the postoperative systemic coagulation mechanism.\nThe results indicated that soluble FM-fibrinogen complex appears to be a useful diagnostic molecular marker to assess the activity of the coagulation system, and that its preoperative level may serve as a potential risk factor for intraoperative hemorrhagic diathesis in patients undergoing elective AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "The necessity of operative treatment of endotension after endovascular grafting of abdominal aortic aneurysms (endovascular aneurysm repair; EVAR) is under debate. The proposed causes of endotension and related treatment protocols are controversial. We report the outcome of a nonoperative approach to five patients with endotension after EVAR.\nFrom February 1997 to August 2004, 160 patients who underwent EVAR of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm were evaluated for the incidence of endotension. According to the endovascular protocol, plain radiographs, spiral computed tomography, and angiography were performed before and after surgery for follow-up. To detect endotension, spiral computed tomography was performed by using a delayed imaging technique after the infusion of contrast medium. Endotension was defined as an aneurysm sac enlargement after EVAR without evidence of endoleak. Aneurysm sac rupture was defined as discontinuity of the calcific rim of the aneurysmal sac and the presence of intra-aneurysmal fluid outside the sac.\nWe found five (3.1%) patients with endotension. Three of these experienced aneurysmal sac rupture. Only one of the three was underwent operation on experiencing sudden intestinal occlusion due to intra-abdominal adhesions. This patient had no intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding or hematoma but died after intensive care as a result of non-aneurysm-related problems. Four patients with endotension are still being closely followed up according to our surveillance protocol, and they are doing clinically well. After rupture, clear shrinking of the aneurysm sac was seen in two patients.\nEndotension after EVAR may cause subsequent aneurysm rupture. Endotension is evidently not associated with endoleak I to III provided that the endovascular graft is maintained in appropriate position and that free endovascular flow is observed. We propose to consider a nonoperative approach in the clinically asymptomatic patient with aneurysm enlargement after EVAR if endoleak is excluded by well-performed imaging techniques.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the relative risks and advantages of using the Hemobahn graft for popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) treatment compared with open repair (OR). The primary end point was patency rate; secondary end points were hospital stay and length of surgical procedure.\nThe study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial carried out at a single center from January 1999 to December 2003. Inclusion criteria were an aneurysmal lesion in the popliteal artery with a diameter > or = 2 cm at the angio-computed tomography (CT) scan, and proximal and distal neck of the aneurysm with a length of > 1 cm to offer a secure site of fixation of the stent graft. Exclusion criteria were age < 50 years old, poor distal runoff, contraindication to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic therapy, and symptoms of nerve and vein compression. The enrolled patients were thereafter prospectively randomized in a 1-to-1 ratio between OR (group A) or endovascular therapy (ET) (group B). The follow-up protocol consisted of duplex ultrasound scan and ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured during a force leg flexion at 1, 3, and 6 months. Group B patients underwent an angio-CT scan and plain radiography of the knee with leg flexion (> 120 degrees) at 6 and 12 months, and then yearly.\nBetween January 1999 and December 2003, 30 PAAs were performed: 15 OR (group A) and 15 ET (group B). Bypass and exclusion of the PAA was the preferred method of OR; no perioperative graft failure was observed. Twenty stent grafts were placed in 15 PAAs. Endograft thrombosis occurred in one patient (6.7%) in the postoperative period. The mean follow-up period was 46.1 months (range, 12 to 72 months) for group A and 45.9 months (range, 12 to 65 months) for group B. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a primary patency rate of 100% at 12 months for OR and 86.7% at 12 months with a secondary patency rate of 100% at 12 and 36 months for ET. No statistical differences were observed at the log-rank test. The mean operation time (OR, 155.3 minutes; ET, 75.4 minutes) and hospital stay (OR, 7.7 days; ET, 4.3 days) were statistically longer for OR compared with ET (P < .01).\nWe can conclude, with the power limitation of the study, that PAA treatment can be safely performed by using either OR or ET. ET has several advantages, such as quicker recovery and shorter hospital stay.",

Bypass and exclusion of the PAA was the preferred method of OR; no perioperative graft failure was observed. Twenty stent grafts were placed in 15 PAAs. Endograft thrombosis occurred in one patient (6.7%) in the postoperative period. The mean follow-up period was 46.1 months (range, 12 to 72 months) for group A and 45.9 months (range, 12 to 65 months) for group B. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a primary patency rate of 100% at 12 months for OR and 86.7% at 12 months with a secondary patency rate of 100% at 12 and 36 months for ET. No statistical differences were observed at the log-rank test. The mean operation time (OR, 155.3 minutes; ET, 75.4 minutes) and hospital stay (OR, 7.7 days; ET, 4.3 days) were statistically longer for OR compared with ET (P < .01).",

    "abstract": "A 300-bed general hospital in a mid-sized city has a busy cardiac catheterization laboratory, with 12 invasive cardiologists and more than 4000 annual procedures. An invasive radiology suite, the only one in town, is staffed by a single invasive radiologist and two vascular surgeons. They perform about 150 diagnostic angiograms and endovascular procedures each year, about half of which are generated by consultation requests from the cardiologists. The invasive radiology team has worked together for the last 5 years, since an endovascular fellowship-trained vascular surgeon joined the staff. The invasive radiologist helped to develop an endovascular team and mentored the more senior vascular surgeon until he could accumulate the requisite number of procedures to become credentialed. The program's finances and work schedule have been arranged to the satisfaction of all three participants. Until recently, whenever cardiologists found evidence of vascular occlusive disease during catheterizations, they changed host arteries; if symptoms and signs indicated a need for therapy, they referred patients to the invasive radiology clinic. Lately, the cardiologists have begun to perform terminal angiograms on all their patients to detect injuries. They have requested clinical privileges to perform peripheral endovascular procedures as well as traditional cardiac work. The hospital administrator is fearful that the cardiologists may leave the hospital if their request is denied. The invasive radiology staff are concerned that the caseload is insufficient to maintain quality if they must divide it with the cardiologists. You are the hospital Chief of Staff and must decide whether to grant the cardiologists privileges which have thus far been reserved to the endovascular team. What should you do?",

    "abstract": "Insufficient blood flow through end-resistance arteries leads to symptoms associated with peripheral vascular disease. This may be caused in part by poor macrocirculatory inflow or impaired microcirculatory function. Dysfunction of the microcirculation occurs in a similar fashion in multiple tissue beds long before the onset of atherosclerotic symptoms. Impaired microcirculatory vasodilatation has been shown to occur in certain disease states including peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, chronic renal failure, abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease, and venous insufficiency, as well as in menopause, advanced age, and obesity. Microcirculatory structure and function can be evaluated with transcutaneous oxygen, pulp skin flow, iontophoresis, and capillaroscopy. We discuss the importance of the microcirculation, investigative methods for evaluating its function, and clinical applications and review the literature of the microcirculation in these different states.",

Computed tomography angiography demonstrated bilateral internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms, with disruption of flow on the left and a carotid-jugular fistula on the right. At operation, transection of the left internal carotid artery necessitated ligation of the artery. No injuries to the trachea or larynx were found, but the pharynx was lacerated and was repaired. The patient was transferred to the angiography suite where a stent graft was placed in the right internal carotid artery. This served to close the pseudoaneurysm and the arteriovenous fistula while preserving distal flow. The patient recovered with intact cerebral function and with mild paresis of the tongue related to hypoglossal nerve injury. He was discharged home after 7 days.",

    "abstract": "Interval gangrene-necrosis of tissue proximal to a successful distal revascularization procedure-is an exceeding rare complication. To date, only nine cases have been reported in the literature, and all were secondary to traditional open bypass procedures. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of interval gangrene after endovascular stent placement in the superficial femoral artery. We believe that with the increasing utilization of endovascular techniques to treat limb ischemia, the serious complication of interval gangrene must be revisited. Assessment of collateral circulation, precise stent placement, and the appropriate choice of stents and stent grafts will become increasing important as more and more of these lesions are treated with endovascular techniques.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulceration are consequences of elevated pressure within affected limbs. We hypothesized that wounded cells maintained at different atmospheric pressures heal at different rates and that pressure would adversely affect the processes necessary for wound healing.\nWe have developed an in vitro model that replicates venous hypertension in a unique pressurized incubator using neonatal fibroblasts. Neonatal fibroblasts grown to confluence were wounded with a standardized linear incision and then placed in a unique pressure incubator at atmospheric pressure, atmospheric pressure plus 30 mm Hg, atmospheric pressure plus 60 mm Hg, and atmospheric pressure plus 120 mm Hg. Cells were observed daily until complete healing of the wound occurred. Twelve to 18 hours after wounding, proliferating cell nuclear antigen analysis was done by immunocytochemistry.\nWounds at atmospheric pressure plus 30 mm Hg were healed by day 3, those at atmospheric pressure plus 60 mm Hg by day 4, and those grown at atmospheric pressure plus 120 mm Hg took > or =4 days for complete healing. Significantly less proliferating cell nuclear antigen activity was present in cells grown at atmospheric pressure plus 60 mm Hg (P < .0001) and atmospheric pressure plus 120 mm Hg (P < .02). Wound edge fluorescence analysis demonstrated less fluorescence in each group compared with atmospheric pressure.\nIn this model of wound healing under pressure, neonatal fibroblasts grown to confluence and given a standardized wound displayed characteristics consistent with delayed healing. Elevated pressure has a role in the delayed migration and proliferation seen in this model.\nThe elevated pressure in patients with venous insufficiency causes their wounds to heal less quickly. Understanding and quantifying the physiology and role of elevated tissue pressure due to venous hypertension will lead to a better understanding of wound healing in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Resolution of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is involved in the pathogenesis of postthrombotic syndrome. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes that are critical in angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. We hypothesized that MMP-2 and its membrane-bound activator membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expression would be expressed and activated during the resolution of DVT.\nDVT was generated by caval ligation in wild-type and MMP-2 transgenic reporter mice. Ligated and sham-operated (control) cavae were analyzed for MMP-2 transcription (beta-galactosidase activity in MMP-2 reporter mice) and MT1-MMP mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction. MMP-2 activity was determined by zymography, and immunohistochemical staining for beta-galactosidase and MT1-MMP protein was used to localize expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with 10 U/mL thrombin and MMP-2 and MT1-MMP mRNA levels and MMP-2 activity was determined.\nMMP-2 activity increased 71% (n = 5, P < .05) at day 8 in ligated vs control cavae by zymography. beta-galactosidase activity showed a 1.2-fold (n = 8, P < .05) and 1.7-fold (n = 8, P < .05) induction in MMP-2 transcription at day 3 and day 8, respectively. No significant MT1-MMP gene induction was seen at day 3 in ligated vs control cavae, but MT1-MMP mRNA was upregulated 2.5-fold (n = 8, P < .05) in ligated cavae at day 8. Immunohistochemical staining localized MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression to the vein wall and cellular infiltrates of the thrombus. Thrombin-treated HUVEC showed differential responses of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. Zymography of conditioned media and cell lysates illustrated a 220% (152.6 +/- 8.6 vs 69.445 +/- 5.46 pixels/unit area, n = 5, P < .05) and 150% (74.1 +/- 7.3 vs 49.2 +/- 5.7 pixels/unit area, n = 5, P < .05) increases in MMP-2 activity respectively. MMP-2 mRNA levels were downregulated 30% (0.48 +/- 0.023 vs 0.63 +/- 0.035 copies of MMP-2 mRNA/copy GAPDH, n = 5, P < .05), whereas MT1-MMP message was upregulated 250% (0.147 +/- 0.009 vs 0.059 +/- 0.005 copies of MT1-MMP mRNA/copy GAPDH, n = 5, P < .05).\nResolution of DVT is associated with increased MMP-2 transcription and activity as well as MT1-MMP expression. Thrombin may mediate the increase in MT1-MMP noted in DVT. This is the first article studying MMP-2 and MT1-MMP transcription in DVT. These findings add DVT resolution to the class of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders in which transcriptional activation of the MT1-MMP/MMP-2 genes occurs and identify a potential therapeutic target to modulate this clinically relevant process.\nPostthrombotic syndrome remains a significant clinical problem after deep venous thrombosis (DVT), but the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in thrombus resolution and vein wall fibrosis remain undefined. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes are critical to cell migration and matrix breakdown. We identify gene transcription and activity of two MMP isoforms, MMP-2 and MMP-14 (membrane type MMP 1, MT1-MMP) in the resolution phase of experimental DVT and in thrombin-treated endothelial cells. These studies define new proteases potentially important to resolution of DVT and development of postthrombotic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Engineered overexpression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in vascular cells has been proposed as a means to decrease intravascular thrombosis; however, tPA gene transfer has augmented intimal hyperplasia in vivo in some studies. The purpose of this study was to define in vitro the effect of tPA gene transfer on smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nHuman SMCs were retrovirally transduced with the tPA gene (SMCs/tPA).\nIn the absence of plasminogen, no statistical differences in proliferation, migration, and morphology were observed between SMCs/tPA and SMCs. In the presence of plasminogen, many differences became apparent. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation was 10-fold higher in SMCs/tPA than in SMCs. This activation was inhibited by aprotinin, a plasmin inhibitor. Collagen degradation increased sevenfold in SMCs/tPA. SMCs/tPA contracted dramatically in the presence of plasminogen. This cell contraction, indicative of extracellular matrix degradation, was blocked by aprotinin and partially inhibited by MMP inhibitors. SMC/tPA-conditioned medium induced significantly more SMC proliferation. The migration of SMCs/tPA through a porous membrane significantly exceeded untransduced SMCs.\nOver-expression of tPA in SMCs results in increased extracellular matrix degradation and can promote cell proliferation and migration. This effect is mediated via plasmin, which further activates MMP-2.\nTPA has been clinically used as a thrombolytic agent in the treatment of acute thrombotic disorders. Transferring the tPA gene into vascular cells as a strategy of gene therapy has been proposed to enhance fibrinolytic capability and therefore inhibit thrombosis and restenosis after vascular interventions. The mechanism(s) by which tPA affects SMC proliferation and vascular remodeling has not been thoroughly characterized. This study unveils the relationship between thrombolytic activity and intimal hyperplasia by showing how the elevated expression of tPA affects the vascular remodeling. This study underscores that the overexpression of an enzyme thought beneficial to blood flow can potentially compromise blood flow by altering the biology of the cell engineered to express it. The results are important to the rational engineering of bioactive grafts with better patency. A new strategy to enhance the thrombolytic ability of a vascular surface without inducing excessive neointimal hyperplasia is proposed.",

    "results": "In the absence of plasminogen, no statistical differences in proliferation, migration, and morphology were observed between SMCs/tPA and SMCs. In the presence of plasminogen, many differences became apparent. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation was 10-fold higher in SMCs/tPA than in SMCs. This activation was inhibited by aprotinin, a plasmin inhibitor. Collagen degradation increased sevenfold in SMCs/tPA. SMCs/tPA contracted dramatically in the presence of plasminogen. This cell contraction, indicative of extracellular matrix degradation, was blocked by aprotinin and partially inhibited by MMP inhibitors. SMC/tPA-conditioned medium induced significantly more SMC proliferation. The migration of SMCs/tPA through a porous membrane significantly exceeded untransduced SMCs.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the hypothesis that clamping the aorta above the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) followed by suprarenal aortic clamping and reperfusion (SRACR) decreases microvascular blood flow by loss of endogenous medullary and cortical nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) E(2) synthesis.\nAnesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (350 g) had either microdialysis probes or laser Doppler fibers inserted into the renal cortex to a depth of 2 mm and into the renal medulla at 4 mm. Laser Doppler blood flow was continuously monitored (data reported as percentage of change compared to basal), and the microdialysis probes were connected to a syringe pump and perfused in vivo at 3 microL/min with lactated Ringer solution. Dialysate fluid was collected at basal time zero, following 30 minutes of suprarenal aortic clamping (ischemia) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion and compared to a sham operation. Both groups were treated with saline carrier, indomethacin (INDO) (10 mg/kg, a cyclooxygenase [COX] inhibitor), N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg, a NO synthase [NOS] inhibitor), or L-arginine (200 mg/kg, an NO precursor). Dialysate was analyzed for total NO (muM) and PGE(2) (pg/mL) synthesis. The renal cortex and medulla were analyzed for inducible NOS (iNOS) and COX-2 content by Western blot. All data are reported as mean +/- SEM, N > 5 and analyzed by analysis of variance.\nSRACR caused a marked decrease in medullary and cortical blood flow with a concomitant decrease in endogenous medullary and cortical NO synthesis. Treatment with L-NAME further decreased blood flow and NO synthesis in the medulla and cortex. L-Arginine restored medullary and cortical NO synthesis and blood flow in the cortex but not the medulla. SRACR did not alter renal medullary or cortical PGE(2); however, addition of INDO, COX inhibitor, caused a concomitant decrease in medullary and cortical PGE(2) synthesis and blood flow.\nNO is an important endogenous renal vasodilator that, when maintained can help preserve cortical blood flow following SRACR. These data also suggest that avoidance of COX-2 inhibitors can help maintain endogenous renal cortical and medullary PGE(2) synthesis and thus contribute to maintaining normal blood flow.\nThis study is the first to combine in vivo physiologic assays to simultaneously identify clinically relevant intrarenal vasodilators (cortical and medullary) that are required to maintain microvascular blood flow. Identification of endogenous renal cortical and medullary vasodilators responsible for maintaining renal microvascular blood flow will allow development of treatment strategies to preserve these vasodilators following SRACR. Successful preservation of endogenous intrarenal vasodilators will help maintain renal microvascular blood flow and renal function in the treatment of complex aortic pathology that requires SRACR.",

    "abstract": "Based on the significant number of unfilled vascular fellowship positions in the 2004 National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) and the perception of program directors that the quality of candidates is deteriorating, the Issues Committee of the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS) explored the characteristics and the trend of the applicant pool to develop recommendations for improvement.\nThe Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) database was queried for the total number of applicants, medical school, gender, and age, among other characteristics. The vascular surgery applicant pool was compared to the applicant pool for general surgery; the applicant pool for all fellowship positions, including a variety of medical subspecialties; the applicant pool for all residency positions; and the applicant pool for colorectal surgery, the only other surgical subspecialty participating in ERAS in 2004. NRMP data was used prior to 2004. The chi(2) test was used for statistical analysis, with significance set at P < .05.\nIn the 2004 match for June 2005 positions, there were 100 applicants for 110 first-year vascular surgery positions in 90 programs. In 1989, there were 123 applicants for 56 positions in 49 programs. In 1989, 55% of vascular surgery applicants did not match; whereas in 2004, only 7% were unmatched. Although the overall number of vascular surgery applicants has remained relatively stable, the number of United States applicants has decreased from 89% in 1990 to 68% in 2004 (P < .01). There was a significant geographic variation: 34% of those in the applicant pool came from the state of New York, but 23 states did not contribute a single applicant to the pool. In addition, vascular surgery, like other fellowships, attracts fewer female applicants.\nThe data from the ERAS database support the impression held by many in the vascular surgery education community that the size of the applicant pool for vascular surgery fellowship positions has remained stagnant, while the number of positions has significantly increased. Strategies to increase the size and quality of the applicant pool are needed.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the phenomenon of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) formation in venous thrombus.\nPatients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation for deep venous thrombosis were included. Duplex ultrasound scanning was used to detect flow within the thrombus. The flow patterns and the resistivity index were obtained in the veins above/proximal and below/distal to the thrombus, in the adjacent arteries, and within the perivenous vessels. Patients with trauma, hemodialysis access, endovenous ablation, known AVF, or inflammatory conditions were excluded.\nThere were 22 patients with AVF flow in thrombosed veins. Deep veins were involved in 15 cases and superficial veins in the remainder. Perivenous vessels feeding the AVF in the thrombus could be clearly identified in 16 patients (19 vein segments). In 21 of 22 patients, multiple flow channels were present throughout the involved thrombosed vein segment. These flow channels were isolated to a single vein segment. They measured <4 cm in length in 19 cases and were more extensive in the remaining three. Reflux within the vein segment was identified in 13 cases. Local symptoms that could be attributed to the arterialization of thrombosed veins occurred in four cases, and none of the patients manifested systemic symptoms. The flow within the thrombus had high end-diastolic velocities with a mean resistivity index of 0.48 (SD, 0.08), which is typical of a fistula flow pattern. The flow in the main arteries was unaffected.\nNeovessels were found with AVF flow in thrombi of superficial and deep veins. They had variable length and multiple flow channels, with inflow from perivenous arteries. The flow in the adjacent main arteries was not affected, and no systemic symptoms were detected. The exact etiology and natural history of this phenomenon are not known, and its clinical significance is unclear.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the impact of postoperative sensory abnormalities and bruising after long saphenous vein (LSV) stripping on short-term quality of life (QOL).\nSeventy patients with LSV incompetence were recruited before surgery. Surgery involved saphenofemoral disconnection, stripping of the LSV in the thigh, and multiple stab avulsions in all patients. Sensory abnormalities (subjective and objective) and bruising were recorded at two follow-up visits (mean, 8 and 47 days). The bruised area was traced manually, and the surface area was estimated by placing the tracing on a square chart. A QOL assessment was performed before surgery and repeated during the second visit by using the Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire. Minitab version 13.32 was used for statistical analysis.\nEight patients either did not complete follow-up or were excluded from the final analysis. Final analysis was performed on 63 limbs in 62 patients (27 men and 35 women; age, 19-75 years). The overall incidence of postoperative sensory abnormality was 40% (25/63 limbs). This included numbness or decreased sensation in 36.5% (23/63), paresthesia in 8% (5/63), and dysesthesia in 1.6% (1/63). Irrespective of the presence of sensory abnormalities, QOL scores improved after surgery (mean change in QOL score, -7.58 and -7.52; SE, 1.1 and 1.3 in those with and without sensory abnormalities, respectively). There was no significant difference either in the degree of improvement in the QOL score (P = .972; t test) or in the proportion of patients with an improved score (P = .69; Fisher exact test) between the groups with and without sensory abnormalities. Postoperative bruising at first follow-up ranged from 28 to 1419 cm(2) (mean, 500.7 cm(2); median, 438 cm(2)). Both groups--those who bruised less than the median value (438 cm(2)) and those who bruised more than the median value--showed improved postoperative QOL scores (mean change in QOL score, -7.64 and -7.46; SE, 1.3 and 1.3, respectively). There was no significant difference either in the degree of improvement in the QOL score (P = .924; t test) or in the proportion of patients with an improved score (P = .422; Fisher exact test). All patients with persistent bruising at the second follow-up (26%) also showed an improvement in the QOL score (mean change in QOL score, -10.29).\nConventional surgery for varicose veins with stripping of the LSV is associated with significant morbidity of sensory abnormalities and bruising. However, this does not adversely affect postoperative improvement in short-term QOL.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular radiofrequency obliteration has been used as an alternative to conventional vein-stripping surgery for elimination of saphenous vein insufficiency. A clinical registry was established in 1998, and its mid-term results have been reported previously. This study is to demonstrate the long-term treatment outcomes and to determine the risk factors that affect treatment efficacy.\nData were collected in an ongoing multicenter, prospective registry. Patients were treated before October 2004. Clinical and duplex ultrasound follow-up was performed 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, and yearly thereafter to 5 years. Treatment efficacy and clinical improvement after the procedure were analyzed. Three types of anatomical failure were identified. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the existence of any significant risk factors associated with anatomical failure. Risk factors considered were age, gender, body mass index, vein diameter, and pullback speed. The impact of anatomical failure on clinical symptoms and varicose vein recurrence was also analyzed.\nThere were 1,006 patients (1,222 limbs) treated, their mean age was 47.4 +/- 12.1 years, and 78.1% were female. Veins treated included 89.1% great saphenous vein above-knee segments, 1.2% great saphenous vein below-knee segments, 4.1% great saphenous vein groin-to-ankle, 4.3% small saphenous veins, and 1.3% accessory saphenous veins. Mean vein diameter was 7.5 mm, with a maximum of 24 mm. Vein occlusion rates were 87.1%, 88.2%, 83.5%, 84.9%, and 87.2%, and reflux-free rates were 88.2%, 88.2%, 88.0%, 86.6%, and 83.8% at each annual follow-up. Clinical symptom improvement was seen in 70% to 80% of limbs with anatomical failures and in 85% to 94% of limbs with anatomical success from 6 months to 5 years after the radiofrequency obliteration. Logistic regression analysis showed that catheter pullback speed (P < .0001) and body mass index (P < .0333) were risk factors for anatomical failure. Limbs that had type II and type III anatomical failures were found to be more prone to varicose vein recurrence.\nEndovascular radiofrequency obliteration of saphenous vein reflux exhibits enduring efficacy. Adequate pullback speed during the procedure should be emphasized to ensure the proper thermal dose delivery. A whole treatment strategy to address hemodynamically significant tributaries and perforators can further improve treatment outcomes. Body mass index is a risk factor for anatomical failure, indicating the impact of hemodynamic factors on disease progression and recurrence.",

Clinical symptom improvement was seen in 70% to 80% of limbs with anatomical failures and in 85% to 94% of limbs with anatomical success from 6 months to 5 years after the radiofrequency obliteration. Logistic regression analysis showed that catheter pullback speed (P < .0001) and body mass index (P < .0333) were risk factors for anatomical failure. Limbs that had type II and type III anatomical failures were found to be more prone to varicose vein recurrence.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the safety and efficacy of endovenous laser treatment (EVLT) of the saphenous vein combined with a surgical strategy for treatment of deep venous insufficiency in the lower extremity.\nTwo hundred thirty venous insufficiencies of the lower limbs in 208 consecutive patients (93 men and 115 women; mean age, 54.15 years) were treated with EVLT combined with surgical strategies. All patients were symptomatic. There were 84 limbs (36.5%) in C(2), 25 (10.9%) in C(3), 109 (47.7%) in C(4), 1 (0.4%) in C(5), and 9 (3.9%) in C(6) (CEAP), and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome was present in 2 limbs. A total of 119 (51.7%) had perforator vein incompetence. Four therapeutic methods were included in this series according to symptoms, CEAP classification, and venous reflux. Simple EVLT was performed for 15 patients with only great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence or Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome in 19 lower limbs. EVLT combined with high ligation of the GSV and open ligation of perforators was performed for 5 patients with GSV and perforator incompetence in 5 lower limbs. EVLT was combined with high ligation of the GSV for 76 patients with GSV incompetence in 94 lower limbs. EVLT was combined with external banding of the first femoral venous valve and high ligation of the GSV for 112 patients with primary deep venous insufficiency in 112 lower limbs. All patients were followed up on an outpatient basis for physical examinations and postoperative complaints, and duplex ultrasonography was performed 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after operation.\nAll patients tolerated the procedure well and returned to normal daily activities immediately, achieving a 100% immediate clinical success rate. Spot skin burn injuries occurred in 2 patients (1.0%). Paresthesia in the gaiter area was noted in 15 patients (7.2%). No postprocedural symptomatic deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism occurred. Three patients had local recurrent varicose veins in the calf (1.4%) during a 2- to 27-month follow-up (mean, 6.12 months). Postoperative clinical classes were significantly improved between 2 weeks and 24 months (P = .0001 at 2 weeks and 3 to 18 months; P = .0055 at 24 months compared with before operation), especially in preoperative C(2) to C(3) stage patients, who achieved complete amelioration.\nEVLT is a novel minimally invasive treatment with advantages of safety, effectiveness, and simplicity, and it leaves no scars.

    "abstract": "Endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are new, minimally invasive percutaneous endovenous techniques for ablation of the incompetent great saphenous vein (GSV). We have performed both procedures at the Mayo Clinic during two different consecutive periods. At the time of this report, no single-institution report has compared RFA with EVLT in the management of saphenous reflux. To evaluate early results, we reviewed saphenous closure rates and complications of both procedures.\nBetween June 1, 2001, and June 25, 2004, endovenous GSV ablation was performed on 130 limbs in 92 patients. RFA was the procedure of choice in 53 limbs over the first 24-month period of the study. This technique was subsequently replaced by EVLT, which was performed on the successive 77 limbs. The institutional review board approved the retrospective chart review of patients who underwent saphenous ablation. According to the CEAP classification, 124 limbs were C2-C4, and six were C5-C6. Concomitant procedures included avulsion phlebectomy in 126 limbs, subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery in 10, and small saphenous vein ablation in 4 (EVLT in 1, ligation in 1, stripping in 2). Routine postoperative duplex scanning was initiated at our institution only after recent publications reported thrombotic complications following RFA. This was obtained in 65 limbs (50%) (54/77 [70%] of the EVLT group and 11/53 [20.8%] of the RFA group) between 1 and 23 days (median, 7 days).\nOcclusion of the GSV was confirmed in 93.9% of limbs studied (94.4% in the EVLT [51/54] and 90.9% in the RFA group [10/11]). The distance between the GSV thrombus and the common femoral vein (CFV) ranged from -20 mm (protrusion in the CFV) to +50 mm (median, 9.5 mm) and was similar between the two groups (median, 9.5 mm vs 10 mm). Thrombus protruded into the lumen of the CFV in three limbs (2.3%) after EVLT. All three patients were treated with anticoagulation. One received a temporary inferior vena cava filter because of a floating thrombus in the CFV. Duplex follow-up scans of these three patients performed at 12, 14, and 95 days, respectively, showed that the thrombus previously identified at duplex scan was no longer protruding into the CFV. No cases of pulmonary embolism occurred. The distance between GSV thrombus and the saphenofemoral junction after EVLT was shorter in older patients (P = .006, r(2) = 0.13). The overall complication rate was 15.4% (20.8% in the EVLT and 7.6% in the RFA group, P =.049) and included superficial thrombophlebitis in 4, excessive pain in 6 (3 in the RFA group), hematoma in 1, edema in 3 (1 in the RFA group), and cellulitis in 2. Except for two of the three patients with thrombus extension into the CFV, none of these adverse effects required hospitalization.\nGSV occlusion was achieved in >90% of cases after both EVLT and RFA at 1 month. We observed three cases of thrombus protrusion into the CFV after EVLT and recommend early duplex scanning in all patients after endovenous saphenous ablations. DVT prophylaxis may be considered in patients >50 years old. Long-term follow-up and comparison with standard GSV stripping are required to confirm the durability of these endovenous procedures.",

    "abstract": "The construction of an autogenous radial-cephalic direct wrist arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF) is the primary and best option for vascular access for hemodialysis. However, 10%-24% of RCAVFs thrombose directly after operation or do not function adequately due to failure of maturation. In case of poor arterial and/or poor venous vessels for anastomosis, the outcome of RCAVFs may be worse and an alternative vascular access is probably indicated. A prosthetic graft implant may be a second best option. Therefore, a randomized multicenter study comparing RCAVF with prosthetic (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) graft implantation in patients with poor vessels was performed.\nA total of 383 consecutive new patients needing primary vascular access were screened for enrollment in a prospective randomized study. According to defined vessel criteria from the preoperative duplex scanning, 140 patients were allocated to primary placement of an RCAVF and 61 patients to primary prosthetic graft implantation. The remaining 182 patients were randomized to receive either an RCAVF (n = 92) or prosthetic graft implant (n = 90). Patency rate was defined as the percentage of AVFs that functioned well after implantation.\nPrimary and assisted primary 1-year patencies were 33% +/- 5.3% vs 44% +/- 6.2% (P = .03) and 48% +/- 5.5% vs 63% +/- 5.9% (P = .035) for the RCAVF and prosthetic AVF, respectively. Secondary patencies were 52% +/- 5.5% vs 79% +/- 5.1% (P = .0001) for the RCAVF and prosthetic AVF, respectively. Patients with RCAVFs developed a total of 102 (1.19/patient-year [py]) vs 122 (1.45/py; P = .739) complications in the prosthetic AVFs. A total of 43 (0.50/py) interventions in the RCAVF group and 79 (0.94/py) in the prosthetic graft group were needed for access salvage (P = .077).\nAlthough there were more interventions needed for access salvage in the patients with prosthetic graft implants, we may conclude that patients with poor forearm vessels do benefit from implantation of a prosthetic graft for vascular access.",

    "abstract": "Despite the frequent performance of minor foot amputations in patients with lower extremity vascular disease, little is known regarding the rate of conversion to major amputations and the role of bypass graft timing in relation to amputation.\nBetween January 1990 and December 2001, 670 patients underwent 920 minor amputations (interphalangeal, ray, or transmetatarsal) on 747 limbs.\nOf 670 patients, 468 were men (69.9%), 616 had diabetes mellitus (91.9%), and 137 (19.7%) had a serum creatinine level >2.0 mg/dL, of whom 92 were on dialysis (end-stage renal disease) (11.5%). Ipsilateral revascularization was performed < or =30 days before the initial amputation in 64.9% (485 of 747), whereas 9.8% (73 of 747) had a bypass < or =30 days postamputation. The initial amputation levels were 466 interphalangeal (62.4%), 159 transmetatarsal (21.3%), and 122 ray (16.3%). Operative 30-day mortality was 0.7% (6 of 920). Limb salvage was 89.8% at 1 year and 82.3% at 5 years. Diabetes mellitus had no impact on limb salvage (P = .61). Limb loss predictors included end-stage renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 2.83, P < .01) and the need for transmetatarsal amputation as the initial procedure (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.93; P < .01). Patients with revascularizations subsequent to an initial amputation had a significant increase in limb loss (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.21, P < .005). Patient survival was 83.9% at 1 year and 43.5% at 5 years. Neither gender nor diabetes mellitus impacted survival; however, serum creatinine levels >2.0 mg/dL (5 years, 48.8% +/- 2.3% vs 23.9% +/- 4.2%, P < .0001) and the need for a major amputation < or =30 days (3 years, 60.8% +/- 2.1% vs 40.1% +/- 7.8%, P < .01) adversely affected survival.\nAlthough minor amputations can lead to limb preservation in most patients, the performance of a revascularization subsequent to amputation, transmetatarsal as the initial amputation, and end-stage renal disease are poor prognostic indicators. Inferior long-term patient survival is most closely associated with renal insufficiency and conversion to major amputation early after the initial procedure.",

Limb loss predictors included end-stage renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 2.83, P < .01) and the need for transmetatarsal amputation as the initial procedure (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.93; P < .01). Patients with revascularizations subsequent to an initial amputation had a significant increase in limb loss (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.21, P < .005). Patient survival was 83.9% at 1 year and 43.5% at 5 years. Neither gender nor diabetes mellitus impacted survival; however, serum creatinine levels >2.0 mg/dL (5 years, 48.8% +/- 2.3% vs 23.9% +/- 4.2%, P < .0001) and the need for a major amputation < or =30 days (3 years, 60.8% +/- 2.1% vs 40.1% +/- 7.8%, P < .01) adversely affected survival.",

    "abstract": "To review our 11-year experience of iliac angioplasty with selective stenting and to evaluate the safety, short- and long-term patency, clinical success rates, and predictive risk factors in patients with iliac artery occlusive disease.\nFrom August 1993 to November 2004, 151 iliac lesions (149 stenoses, 2 occlusions) in 104 patients were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). The patients had chronic limb ischemia described as disabling claudication (the Society for Vascular Surgery clinical category 2 or 3) in 76 (50%), rest pain (category 4) in 38 (25%), and ulcer/gangrene (category 5) in 37 (25%). Forty-six limbs (30%) were treated with concomitant infrainguinal endovascular (36, 24%) or open procedures (10, 6%). Thirty-four limbs (23%) had one or more stents placed for primary PTA failure, including residual stenosis (> or =30%), mean pressure gradient (> or =5 mm Hg), or dissection (stent group); whereas, 117 limbs (77%) underwent PTA alone (PTA group). The affected arteries treated were 28 (19%) common iliac, 31 (20%) external iliac, and 92 (61%) both arteries. According to TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification, 39 limbs (26%) were in type A, 71 (47%) in type B, 36 (24%) in type C, and 5 (3%) in type D. Reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery were followed.\nThere was no perioperative death. Total complication rate was 0.7% (one groin hematoma). The mean follow-up was 21 months (median, 10; range, 1 to 94 months). Only 9 (8%) of 117 of the PTA group had subsequent stent placement for recurrent stenosis. The iliac lesions were more severe and extensive in the stent group than those in the PTA group according to TASC classification (Mann-Whitney U test [M-W], P < .0001) and anatomic location (M-W, P = .0019). The technical success rate was 99%, and the initial clinical success rate was 99%. Overall, the cumulative primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 76%, 59%, and 49% (Kaplan-Meier [K-M]). The cumulative assisted primary and secondary patency rates at 7 years were 98% and 99% (K-M). The mean number of subsequent iliac endovascular procedures was 1.4 per limb in patients with primary failure of iliac angioplasty/stenting. The continued clinical improvement rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 81%, 67%, and 53% (K-M). The limb salvage rates at 7 year were 93% (K-M). Of 15 predictor variables studied in 151 iliac lesions, the significant independent predictors for adverse outcomes were smoking history (P = .0074), TASC type C/type D lesions (P = .0001), and stenotic ipsilateral superficial femoral artery (P = .0002) for the primary patency rates; chronic renal failure with hemodialysis (P = .014), ulcer/gangrene as an indication for PTA (P < .0001), and stenotic ipsilateral superficial femoral artery (P = .034) for the continued clinical improvement (K-M, log-rank test and Cox regression model).\nAlthough the primary patency rates were not high, the assisted primary and secondary patency rates were excellent without primary stenting. Overall, >70% of iliac lesions were treated successfully with PTA alone. The results of this study show that selective stenting offers satisfactory assisted primary and secondary long-term patency after iliac angioplasty. Patients with TASC type C/type D iliac lesions, a stenotic ipsilateral superficial femoral artery, ulcer/gangrene, smoking history, and chronic renal failure with hemodialysis should be followed carefully after endovascular iliac revascularization. These risk factors could be considered indications for primary stenting, although further studies are needed to confirm this.",

    "abstract": "Patients who require infrainguinal revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI) are at elevated risk for cardiovascular events. The PREVENT III study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, phase 3 trial of edifoligide for the prevention of vein graft failure in patients with CLI. We examined the baseline characteristics, perioperative medical therapies, and 30-day incidence of major cardiovascular events in the PREVENT III cohort.\nDemographics, medical and surgical history, mode of presentation for the index limb, procedural details, and concomitant medications were reviewed for all patients enrolled in PREVENT III (N = 1,404). Major adverse cardiovascular events, including death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack) were tabulated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to discern factors that were associated with the utilization of medical therapies and with perioperative events.\nDemographics and comorbidities reflected a population with diffuse, advanced atherosclerosis. Perioperative mortality was 2.7%, and major morbidity included myocardial infarction in 4.7% and stroke/transient ischemic attack in 1.4%. Among this population of CLI patients, 33% were not on antiplatelet therapy at study entry, and 24% were not receiving antithrombotics of any type. In addition, 54% of patients were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, and 52% were not prescribed beta-blocker medications at study entry. On multivariate analysis, race was a significant determinant of antithrombotic utilization, with African-American patients less frequently treated both at baseline and discharge (adjusted odd ratios, 0.5 and 0.6, P < .0001). Antithrombotic and beta-blocker drug usage increased in the overall cohort from baseline (76% and 48%) to discharge (88% and 60%; P < .0001). Patients treated in a university hospital setting were more likely to be prescribed antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and beta-blocker medications. Advanced age (>75 years), coronary artery disease (prior myocardial infarction or revascularization), and dialysis-dependent renal failure were associated with an increased 30-day risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Protective effects of beta-blocker and lipid-lowering medications were noted in these defined subgroups.\nA significant percentage of the population that undergoes surgical revascularization for CLI is not prescribed therapies of proven benefit in reducing cardiovascular events. Utilization of antithrombotics and beta-blockers increases during hospitalization for limb salvage surgery but that of lipid-lowering therapy does not. African-American patients appear to be at greater risk for undertreatment with antithrombotics, and the data suggest that patients undergoing leg bypass surgery in a university hospital setting receive more comprehensive medical treatment of atherosclerosis. Treatment guidelines for medical therapy are needed to standardize care and improve outcomes for patients with CLI.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have described acceptable results for infrapopliteal bypass surgery that uses an autogenous vein other than the greater saphenous vein but is still no reliable prediction of outcomes. The objective of this study was to use meta-analysis to assess the long-term outcomes after infrapopliteal bypass grafting done with alternate autologous veins.\nStudies published from 1982 through 2004 were identified from electronic databases and pertinent original articles. Thirty-two series were selected, all of which had used survival analysis and had reported a 1-year graft patency rate, with at least 15 bypasses. An interval success rate was calculated for each month in each series of grafts by using data from life tables, survival curves, and texts. Monthly success rates were combined across series to obtain a pooled estimate of success for each month. Pooled survival curves were then constructed for graft patency and foot preservation.\nThe 5-year pooled estimates were 46.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 35.5%-58.3%) for primary patency, 66.5% (95% CI = 54.9%-78.2%) for secondary patency, and 76.4% (95% CI = 68.0%-84.8%) for foot preservation. These results were far superior to those reported for nonautologous grafts. Intensive duplex surveillance had a favorable impact on graft patency and foot preservation. No publication bias was detected.\nWhen the greater saphenous vein is unavailable, alternate autologous veins are preferable to other graft materials in bypass surgery to infrapopliteal arteries.",

The indication for bypass was limb salvage in 88.3%, claudication in 9.3%, and other in 2.4%. Atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent, with diabetes mellitus in 68% and dialysis-dependent renal failure in 11.7%.\nThe procedure was successful in all but one patient.

Two injuries to the main trunk of the vein occurred early in the series. Assisted primary patency at a mean follow-up of 18 months (range, 1 to 48 months) is 77.2% by life-table analysis. For patients with claudication, rest pain, or minimal gangrene, the average length of stay was 3.15 days (range, 1 to 6 days). Wound complications occurred in 16 patients (7.5%), 10 of these required only local care (class I and II), and 6 had deep wounds threatening the leg or graft (class III). Only 5 patients, all with class III wounds, required readmission to the hospital for graft-related problems. There is no increase in operating room time once the learning curve is overcome. Patient satisfaction is very high.\nEndoscopic saphenous vein harvest is a useful adjunct to infrainguinal vein bypass, with short length-of-hospital stay, few wound complications, and low hospital readmission rates.

US echolucency was quantitated ex vivo using computerized techniques for gray-scale median (GSM) analysis. Histopathologic correlates for US plaque echolucency (percentage of necrotic core area) and acoustic shadowing (percentage of calcification area) were determined.\nFifty CEA plaques were collected from 48 patients (46 unilateral and two bilateral); 26 of these plaques were from symptomatic patients. Age, degree of stenosis, and atherosclerotic risk factors were similar for the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Using preoperative B-mode US, 58%, 35%, and 7% of symptomatic plaques and 18%, 41%, and 41% of asymptomatic plaques were found to be echolucent, echogenic, and calcific, respectively (P < .05). Using ex-vivo B-mode US and GSM analysis, symptomatic plaques were more echolucent (41 +/- 19) than asymptomatic plaques (60 +/- 13), P < .03. A strong inverse correlation was found between the percent plaque necrotic area core and GSM (R = -0.9, P < .001). Percentage of calcification area in plaques with acoustic shadowing was 66% and only 27% in those without acoustic shadowing (P < .05).\nUsing B-mode US, symptomatic plaques are more echolucent and less calcified than asymptomatic plaques and are associated with a greater degree of histopathologic plaque necrosis. Such features are indicative of plaque instability and should be considered in the decision-making algorithm when selecting patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis for intervention.",

Age, degree of stenosis, and atherosclerotic risk factors were similar for the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Using preoperative B-mode US, 58%, 35%, and 7% of symptomatic plaques and 18%, 41%, and 41% of asymptomatic plaques were found to be echolucent, echogenic, and calcific, respectively (P < .05). Using ex-vivo B-mode US and GSM analysis, symptomatic plaques were more echolucent (41 +/- 19) than asymptomatic plaques (60 +/- 13), P < .03. A strong inverse correlation was found between the percent plaque necrotic area core and GSM (R = -0.9, P < .001). Percentage of calcification area in plaques with acoustic shadowing was 66% and only 27% in those without acoustic shadowing (P < .05).",

    "abstract": "Eversion carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been touted as superior to standard CEA with patch closure because of allegedly lower restenosis rates and greater technical ease of performance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early experience of one vascular surgeon beginning to use this technique.\nThis was a retrospective study in an academic vascular surgical practice. The first 100 patients undergoing CEA via the eversion technique were compared with 100 contemporaneous patients who had standard CEA with patch closure. Residual (first examination within 3 months) or recurrent postoperative duplex scan stenosis, perioperative neurologic deficit, and mortality were analyzed by cumulative sum failure and Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis.\nOperative indications were not significantly different between eversion and standard CEA patients (63% vs 60% asymptomatic, 10% vs 7% stroke, 4% vs 5% amaurosis, and 23% vs 28% transient ischemia). Intraoperative shunting was more commonly used during eversion CEA (87% vs 59%; P < .01). Perioperative neurologic deficits included amaurosis (n = 1) after eversion CEA and transient cerebral ischemia (n = 1) and retinal infarction (n = 1) after standard CEA, with one cardiac death each. By 36 months, one other patient in each group had experienced a transient ischemic event, but there were no strokes. Four carotids occluded within 36 months of eversion CEA, compared with one occlusion after standard CEA (not significant). Patients undergoing eversion CEA showed no difference in critical (>80%) residual or recurrent stenosis rates. However, after eversion CEA, a greater degree of greater than 50% recurrent stenosis was observed at 36 months (38% vs 6%; P < .001) despite similar residual stenosis rates. Cumulative sum failure analysis showed no plateau among patients undergoing eversion CEA, thus indicating the absence of a learning curve, at least within the first 100 patients.\nDespite enthusiasm by advocates for eversion CEA, the recurrent greater than 50% stenosis rate remained high for the first 100 patients who underwent this technique, with no evidence of a learning curve. This observation implies that vascular surgeons considering adoption of this technique should monitor their own early results carefully.",

    "abstract": "The net benefit for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy is critically dependent on the risk of perioperative stroke and death. Information about risk factors can aid appropriate selection of patients and inform efforts to reduce complication rates. This study identifies the clinical, radiographic, surgical, and anesthesia variables that are independent predictors of deaths and stroke following carotid endarterectomy.\nA retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in 1997 and 1998 by 64 surgeons in 6 hospitals was performed (N = 1972). Detailed information on clinical, radiographic, surgical, anesthesia, and medical management variables and deaths or strokes within 30 days of surgery were abstracted from inpatient and outpatient records. Multivariate logistic regression models identified independent clinical characteristics and operative techniques associated with risk-adjusted rates of combined death and nonfatal stroke as well as all strokes.\nDeath or stroke occurred in 2.28% of patients without carotid symptoms, 2.93% of those with carotid transient ischemic attacks, and 7.11% of those with strokes (P < .0001). Three clinical factors increased the risk-adjusted odds of complications: stroke as the indication for surgery (odds ratio [OR], 2.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.55-5.20), presence of active coronary artery disease (OR, 3.58; 95% CI = 1.53-8.36), and contralateral carotid stenosis > or =50% (OR, 2.32; 95% CI = 1.33-4.02). Two surgical techniques reduced the risk-adjusted odds of death or stroke: use of local anesthesia (OR, 0.30; 95% CI = 0.16-0.58) and patch closure (OR, 0.43; 95% CI = 0.24-0.76).\nInformation about these risk factors may help physicians weigh the risks and benefits of carotid endarterectomy in individual patients. Two operative techniques (use of local anesthesia and patch closure) may lower the risk of death or stroke.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) represents a chronic degenerative condition associated with atherosclerosis. Actually, data from experimental and clinical studies suggest that nitric oxide (NO) is a modulator in maintaining endothelial function and antithrombotic intravascular environment. Reduced vascular NO generation in subjects carrying the rare variants of the eNOS gene might predispose to AAA. No information is available about the influence of the eNOS gene T-786C, G894T, and 4a/4b polymorphisms in the susceptibility to the disease.\nIn this study, we evaluated the role of these polymorphisms in the predisposition to AAA and their influence in hypertensive and normotensive patients. We studied 250 consecutive patients with AAA referred to the Unit of Vascular Surgery of the University of Florence compared with 250 truly healthy subjects with a negative history of vascular diseases. All subjects, patients, and controls, underwent duplex scanning examination, and to assess the presence of other atherosclerotic localizations, all patients underwent clinical and instrumental examinations.\nA significant difference in genotype distribution and allele frequency was observed for eNOS G894T but not for T-786C and 4a/4b polymorphisms. At the multivariate analysis after adjustment for traditional vascular risk factors and other atherosclerotic localizations, the eNOS 894T variant was significantly associated with AAA, according to dominant and recessive models (dominant model odds ratio [OR]: 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-3.93, P = .007; recessive model OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.42-5.20, P = .002). When patients with other atherosclerotic localizations were excluded from the analysis, the 894T variant still remained associated with the predisposition to AAA, according to the models considered (dominant model OR: 2.1, 95%CI: 1.23-3.92, P = .007; recessive model OR: 2.8, 95%CI: 1.45-5.24, P = .002).\nThe present study showed that the eNOS G894T polymorphism is a mild modulator of the predisposition to AAA apart from traditional risk factors, suggesting a genetic influence on the molecular mechanisms responsible for this complex disease.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, increasing proportions of aortic aneurysms are repaired electively via the endovascular route. The purpose of this study was to report the recent utilization of endovascular repair in Canada by reviewing a national administrative database.\nThe Canadian Institute for Health Information database (a collection of all acute care hospitalizations) was reviewed to identify patients who received nonemergent repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) between April 1, 2003 and March 31, 2004. During this 1-year period, differentiation between endovascular (EVAR) and open repair was possible using ICD-10-CA procedural codes in eight of ten provinces. Case volumes, patient age, length of hospitalization, and mortality were stratified by method of repair, province, and size and teaching status of hospitals.\nIn this 1-year period, 1996 patients in eight provinces (representing 72% of Canada's population) underwent open repair (n = 1818, 91.1%) or EVAR (n = 178, 8.9%) of a nonruptured AAA. National utilization rates were 8.4 and 0.8 per 100,000 population for open repair and EVAR. These rates were more constant for EVAR (0 to 1.3) then for open repair (4 to 18.3) when analyzed on a provincial basis. Mean patient age did not differ between EVAR and open repair (73.7 vs 71.9 years, P = 0.4) while mean length of stay (5.8 vs 11.9 days, P = 0.03) and in-hospital mortality (0.6% vs 4.6%, P = .025) were significantly lower for EVAR than for open repair. Most EVAR (96%) and more than half of open repairs (56%) were performed in academic teaching centers.\nAlthough EVAR results in significant reductions in length of hospitalization and early mortality, it continues to be underutilized in Canada compared with other national reports involving administrative databases.",

The strategy of treatment generated three cohorts of patients (LA, RA, or GA). Primary outcome included all-cause mortality, nonfatal cardiac morbidity, respiratory complications, and renal failure. Secondary outcome measures included conversion to general anesthesia, use of analgesics, and time-related outcomes (operating time, length of stay in intensive care unit and hospital, time required to resume oral intake, and time to ambulation).\nA total of 239 patients underwent EVAR: 170 LA, 31 RA, and 38 GA. Overall mortality was one patient (0.4%). LA was associated with a lower incidence of complications compared with GA (P < .001). In the LA group, two patients had to be converted to GA, one because of a dissection and one because of anxiety. In 13% of the patients in the LA group, additional intravenous sedation or analgesia was required. Operating time and length of stay in intensive care was shorter in the LA and RA groups than in the GA group (P < .001). Length of stay in hospital and time to ambulation and regular diet was shorter in the LA group compared with the RA and GA groups (P < .001).\nA strategy based on the preferential use of LA for EVAR restricting RA or GA only to those with predefined contraindications is feasible and appears to be well tolerated.",

    "abstract": "Freedom from migration is key to the durability of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). This study evaluates the mid- and long-term incidence of migration with two different endografts.\nBetween September 1997 and June 2004, 235 patients were scheduled for EVAR with an AneuRx (Medtronic/AVE Inc.) or Zenith (Cook) endograft. Patients with fusiform, infrarenal aneurysms and a minimum 12 months of follow-up were analyzed, for a final cohort of 130 patients. Migration was assessed on axial computed tomography (CT) (2.5 to 3 mm cuts) as the distance from the most caudal renal artery to the first slice containing endograft (AneuRx) or to the top of the bare suprarenal stent (Zenith). Aortic neck diameters were measured at the most caudal renal artery. The initial postoperative CT scan was the baseline. Migration was defined by caudal movement of the endograft at two thresholds, > or =5 mm and > or =10 mm, or any migration with a related clinical event.\nLife-table analysis demonstrated AneuRx freedom from migration (> or =10 mm or clinical event) was 96.1%, 89.5%, 78.0%, and 72.0% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. Zenith freedom from migration was 100%, 97.6%, 97.6%, and 97.6% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively (P = .01, log-rank test). The stricter 5-mm migration threshold found 67.4% of AneuRx and 90.1% of Zenith patients free from migration at 4 years of follow-up. Twelve out of 14 (85.7%) AneuRx patients (12/14) with migration (> or =10 mm or clinical event) underwent 14 related secondary procedures (13 endovascular, 1 open conversion). The single Zenith patient with migration (> or =10 mm) has not required adjuvant treatment. Mean follow-up was 39.0 +/- 2.3 months (AneuRx) and 30.8 +/- 1.9 months (Zenith, P = .01). Patients with and without migration did not differ in age, gender ratio, aneurysm diameter, and neck diameter. However, initial neck length was shorter in patients with migration (22.1 +/- 2.1 mm vs 31.2 +/- 1.2 mm, P = .02). A subset of patients (21.6%) experienced significant (defined as > or =3 mm) maximum aortic neck dilation. Of the AneuRx patients, > or =3 mm aortic neck dilation affected 30.8% of migrators vs 13.0% of nonmigrators (P = .20).\nEndograft migration is a time-dependent phenomenon affected by both device choice and aortic neck length. A great majority of patients (85.7%) with migration of the AneuRx device ultimately required treatment. A minority of patients experienced aortic neck dilation that could be considered clinically significant. Careful surveillance for migration is an essential component of long-term follow-up after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) continue to result in early mortality in up to 50% of patients. Additionally, it remains difficult to compare outcomes given the variability in patient comorbidities and presentation. The purpose of this study was to describe an instrument that permits the prospective analysis of outcomes after RAAA repair while adjusting for the variability in preoperative risk.\nConsecutive patients undergoing attempted open RAAA repair over a 5-year period (1999 to 2003) at our center were reviewed. Thirty-day or in-hospital mortality was the main outcome variable. Preoperative mortality risk was estimated for each patient by using a validated modification of the POSSUM scoring system (V-POSSUM). A risk-adjusted cumulative sum method (RA-CUSUM) was used to compare observed versus predicted outcomes by assigning a risk-adjusted score, based on log-likelihood ratios, to each patient. These scores were sequentially plotted with preset control limits to allow for \"signaling\" when results were substantially different from expected (doubling or halving of odds ratios).\nA total of 136 patients were reviewed, with an early mortality rate of 45.6%. V-POSSUM scores were accurate in predicting mortality for the entire cohort, with an observed-to-predicted mortality ratio of 0.92 (P = .80). Each patient's risk-adjusted score was plotted sequentially. In one segment of the resulting plot, the graph adopted a negative slope and crossed the lower control limit, indicating improved results compared with predicted.\nV-POSSUM scores in this series accurately predicted early mortality after RAAA surgery. The RA-CUSUM method allows for the prospective evaluation of outcomes, while taking into account patient variability. In the current study, this resulted in the identification of a series of patients who had improved outcomes compared with predicted.",

    "abstract": "The optimal dialysis access for the patient with chronic renal failure is considered to be an autogenous fistula; this is reflected in the recommendations of the National Kidney Foundation-Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives (NKF-DOQI). If adequate superficial veins at the wrist or the forearm are not available, the next option is usually a prosthetic arteriovenous graft. In this case series, we describe our experience with an autogenous fistula constructed using the brachial vein. There were 20 patients over a 14-month period who were operated on for dialysis access. In these patients, no adequate superficial veins were found at operation. Instead of using a prosthetic graft, we performed a brachial artery-brachial vein fistula in two stages. The first stage involved a forearm anastomosis and then subsequently, weeks later, this fistula was \"superficialized.\" Twenty patients underwent a brachial artery-brachial vein fistula. Of these patients, all had successful maturation of their fistula and after a minimum waiting period of 12 weeks for maturation; all but one were able to be successfully dialyzed through their fistula. One patient developed arm swelling due to previously placed subclavian vein pacemaker wires. None of the other patients developed arm swelling or vascular steal. The brachial artery-brachial vein fistula is a feasible option for hemodialysis access and we suggest that this option be considered before a prosthetic arteriovenous graft is inserted. Arm swelling and steal have not been a problem, and all patients have been able to have full dialysis through the fistula after appropriate maturation times.",

Wegener's granulomatosis was clinically manifested in the 34th week of pregnancy with pulmonary infiltrates, splenic infarcts, and acute limb ischemia. Successive thrombectomies failed to maintain arterial flow in the distal limb due to the development of active vasculitis. Thrombosis of the tibial arteries and recurrence of thrombosis was a persistent clinical observation. In the meantime, a cesarean section was performed, with a successful delivery of a healthy male newborn. Because of the recent cesarean section, the patient did not undergo thrombolysis. The woman finally underwent amputation of the limb. According to the reviewed literature, this is the sixth reported case of Wegener's granulomatosis presenting with digital ischemia and the first manifested during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is characterized by an overproduction of eosinophils that leads to organ damage. Although most cases of HES frequently affect the lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract, there are a few reported cases of peripheral vascular involvement. We report a case of a patient with a history of colonic HES who presented with idiopathic occlusion of the brachial artery. A 28-year-old woman with a recent history of eosinophilic colitis presented with a several-week history of left hand pain, pallor, and paresthesias. Her hand was cool, without palpable pulses. Her eosinophilia count was 38%. An arteriogram documented a left brachial artery occlusion and diffuse left arm vasospasm. A brachial-to-brachial bypass was performed. Postoperatively, there was extensive vasospasm of her distal upper extremity arteries, which was treated with calcium-channel blockers and steroids. Her symptoms resolved and she has been asymptomatic for 9 months. The segment of occluded artery was found to contain many eosinophils on histologic examination. HES of the arterial system is an exceedingly rare cause of occlusion. Our patient presented with eosinophilia, arterial vasospasm with subsequent occlusion, and the presence of eosinophilic infiltration on the pathologic specimen. These data, combined with the patient's previous history, demonstrate that the patient's occlusion may have been secondary to HES.",

An initial renal transplantation failed, and hemoaccess was maintained with multiple central catheters and upper extremity prosthetic arteriovenous grafts. A successful second transplantation eliminated her need for hemodialysis, but a right brachial to internal jugular graft remained patent. Progressive visual loss 2 years after transplantation prompted ophthalmic evaluation which initially revealed unilateral left optic nerve edema and visual loss, ultimately worsening over several months to no light perception in the left eye, 20/60 vision in the right eye, and bilateral papilledema. Arteriography demonstrated cerebral venous hypertension attributed to the functioning hemoaccess graft. Permanent graft occlusion normalized the papilledema, and visual field defects in the right eye and visual acuity returned to 20/20 in the right eye.",

    "abstract": "Nonlaminar shear stress stimulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration in vivo, especially after an endothelial-denuding injury. To determine whether sustained shear stress directly stimulates SMC proliferation in vitro, the effect of orbital shear stress on SMC proliferation, phenotype, and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation was examined.\nBovine SMCs were exposed to orbital shear stress (210 rpm) for up to 10 days, with and without the ERK1/2 upstream pathway inhibitor PD98059 (10 microM) or the p38 pathway inhibitor SB203580 (10 microM). Proliferation was directly counted and assessed with proliferation cell nuclear antigen. Western blotting was used to assess activation of SMC ERK1/2 and SMC phenotype markers.\nSMCs exposed to sustained orbital shear stress (10 days) had 75% increased proliferation after 10 days compared with static conditions. Expression of markers of the contractile phenotype (alpha-actin, calponin) was decreased, and markers of the synthetic phenotype (vimentin, beta-actin) were increased. ERK1/2 was phosphorylated in the presence of orbital shear stress, and orbital shear-stress-stimulated SMC proliferation was inhibited in the presence of PD98059 but sustained in the presence of SB203580. Orbital shear-stress-induced changes in SMC phenotype were also inhibited in the presence of PD98059.\nOrbital shear stress directly stimulates SMC proliferation in long-term culture in vitro and is mediated, at least partially, by the ERK1/2 pathway. The ERK1/2 pathway may also mediate the orbital shear-stress-stimulated switch from SMC contractile to synthetic phenotype. These results suggest that shear-stress-stimulated SMC proliferation after vascular injury is mediated by a pathway amenable to pharmacologic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia remains a serious complication of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic operations. To avoid this dreadful complication, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been examined in the ischemic or excitotoxic neuronal injury model. In the present study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of NMDA receptor antagonists that were infused segmentally after aortic clamping, as a spinoplegia, to reduce aspartate neurotoxicity in the spinal cord.\nInfrarenal aortic isolation was performed in New Zealand white rabbits. Group A animals (n = 7) were pretreated with the segmental infusion of MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, followed by segmental aspartate (50 mmol) infusion for 10 minutes. Group B animals (n = 6) received pretreatment with CGS19755, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, followed by the same aspartate infusion as group A. Group C animals (n = 7) received vehicle only, followed by aspartate infusion as a control group. In addition, group D animals (n = 6) were pretreated with MK-801 that was administrated intravenously 1 hour before aspartate infusion. Neurologic status was assessed at 12, 24, and 48 hours after operation by using the Tarlov score. The spinal cords were procured at 48 hours for histopathologic analysis to determine the extent of excitotoxic neuronal injury.\nMost of the animals in groups A and D revealed full recovery or mild motor disturbance. Group B and C animals exhibited paraplegia or paraparesis with marked neuronal necrosis. In the Tarlov score at 48 hours, group A animals represented better neurologic function than group C (P < .01) and similar motor function to group D animals. Severe histopathologic change was not observed in groups A and D. Animals in groups A and D showed a greater number of motor neurons than animals in groups B and C (P < .01). The difference could be due to chance between group A and D animals (P = .08).\nThese results showed that the segmental infusion of noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist as an intraoperative spinoplegia could have a protective effect on the spinal cord neurons against excitotoxic neuronal injury in vivo. On the other hand, efficacy of the use of competitive antagonist was suggested to be limited in this model, probably because of the insurmountable obstacle of the blood-brain barrier.\nParaplegia is a devastating complication during surgical repair of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortas. Excitatory amino acids neurotoxicity through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is no doubt the pathologic hallmark of ischemic and postischemic spinal cord injury. Systemic administration of either a competitive or noncompetitive NMDA antagonist has been reported to have neuroprotective effect, in terms of preoperative treatment, with dose-related central sympathomimetic and sedative effects. Local administration, particularly of a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, infused segmentally after aortic clamping could therefore be a potent intraoperative pharmacologic strategy to minimize the effective dose that retains NMDA antagonism without undesirable adverse effects. Our ability to reproduce this model could facilitate pharmacologic prevention or provide a new surgical technique as a spinoplegia for NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal injury.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that statins can protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of their lipid-lowering activity through inhibition of the small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, Rho, and Rho-associated kinase. Little information is available on the inhibitory effect of statins on vein graft intimal hyperplasia, the main cause of late graft failure after bypass grafting. We therefore examined the effects of a hydrophilic statin on vein graft intimal hyperplasia in vivo and Rho-kinase activity in vitro.\nIn the first experiment, rabbits were randomized to a control group (n = 7) that was fed regular rabbit chow or to a pravastatin group (n = 7) that was fed regular rabbit chow supplemented with 10 mg/kg pravastatin sodium. The branches of the jugular vein were ligated and an approximately 3-cm segment of the jugular vein was taken for an autologous reversed-vein graft. The carotid artery was cut and replaced with the harvested autologous jugular vein. At 2 and 4 weeks after the operation, vein grafts in both groups were harvested, and intimal hyperplasia of the vein grafts was assessed. In the second experiment, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured and then treated with 1 micromol/L and 30 micromol/L pravastatin for 24 hours and harvested. Immunoblotting was performed on the resulting precipitates. Quantitative evaluation of phosphorylated myosin binding subunit and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was performed by densitometric analysis.\nWe demonstrated that oral administration of the hydrophilic statin pravastatin to normocholesterolemic rabbits inhibited intimal hyperplasia of carotid interposition-reversed jugular vein grafts 4 weeks after implantation (pravastatin group, 39.5 +/- 3.5 microm vs control group, 64.0 +/- 7.1 microm; n = 7; P < .05) and suppressed cell proliferation and apoptosis in the neointima 2 weeks after implantation. In addition, we found that pravastatin inhibited Rho-kinase activity and accelerated endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells but did not inhibit Rho-kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells.\nThese novel findings clearly demonstrate that a hydrophilic statin can suppress intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft in vivo and also show endothelial cell-tropic inhibition of Rho-kinase in vitro. Furthermore, these results strongly support the clinical use of hydrophilic statins to prevent intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft after bypass grafting.\nLate graft failure caused by neointimal hyperplasia limits the efficacy of vein grafting. Various treatments were examined to reduce neointimal hyperplasia, but a standard clinical treatment has not yet been established. We report here the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, we demonstrate that pravastatin showed endothelial cell-tropic benefits through both the inhibition of Rho-kinase activity and acceleration of eNOS expression in vitro. Because the clinical benefits and safety of pravastatin have been established to a certain extent through long-term clinical usage, pravastatin may soon become standard treatment after vein bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous vein bypasses are a common and effective method to treat occlusive disease. During surgical preparation, veins are routinely pressure distended to overcome vasospasm and twists. Distention, however, is believed to promote vascular remodeling and contribute to decreased graft patency. Pharmacologic vasorelaxation with a combination of effective vasodilators has been suggested as an alternative to pressure distention. The extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in vascular remodeling and neointima formation. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of pressure distention with pharmacologic vasorelaxation on graft remodeling and regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in porcine vein grafts.\nCarotid artery bypass utilizing internal jugular veins was performed in eight female white pigs. Jugular veins were randomized to receive pressure distention (300 mm Hg for 2 minutes) or a combination of vasodilators (the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine, 10 micromol/L; the Rho-kinase inhibitor HA-1077 [fasudil], 50 micromol/L; and the calcium-channel blocker nicardipine, 1 micromol/L) for 30 minutes and then were grafted into the carotid arteries. Two weeks after surgery, vein graft samples were analyzed for vessel intimal and medial area, lumen diameter, and ECM composition. Molecular analysis using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western immunoblotting, gelatin zymography, and reverse zymography were performed to study the expression and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2.\nPressure distention irreversibly overstretched the porcine jugular vein and increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteolytic activity by 40% and 77%, respectively. Two weeks of vein grafting in the carotid arterial bed induced vessel wall thickening, ECM modification, and neointima formation, which were more pronounced in the distended grafts (P < .05) and accompanied by an increase in MMP expression and activity. Distended grafts demonstrated higher percentages of active MMP-9 (17.8% +/- 1.0%) and higher activities of latent (35.5% +/- 3.3%) and active MMP-2 (69.6% +/- 8.8%) than the pharmacologically treated grafts. Protein expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was downregulated after arterial grafting, but the pharmacologically treated grafts expressed significantly more TIMP-1 protein (by 36.8% +/- 4.1%) than the distended ones. The activities of TIMPs were markedly decreased after grafting, contributing to the upregulated MMP activity.\nPressure distention of vein grafts before implantation, compared with pharmacologic vasodilatation, stimulates neointima formation and augments MMP activities. Pharmacologic vasorelaxation may be clinically superior to distention in attenuating graft remodeling and possibly improving graft patency.\nAutogenous vein bypasses are a common and effective method to treat occlusive disease. This study demonstrated that pressure distention, a common preparatory procedure in bypass surgery, upregulates extracellular matrix-degrading matrix metalloproteinases, which predisposes vein grafts to extensive remodeling and contributes to neointima formation and graft occlusion. The topical application of a combination of vasodilators to the vein graft before implantation may be clinically superior to pressure distention in attenuating graft remodeling and may possibly improve graft patency and reduce secondary surgical interventions.",

    "abstract": "Several imaging modalities are available for the evaluation of dysfunctional hemodialysis shunts. Color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are most widely used for the detection of access stenoses, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of shunts has recently been introduced. To date, no study has compared the value of these three modalities for stenosis detection in dysfunctional shunts. We prospectively compared CDUS and CE-MRA with DSA for the detection of significant (> or = 50%) stenoses in failing dialysis accesses, and we determined whether the interventionalist would benefit from CDUS performed before DSA and endovascular intervention.\nCDUS, CE-MRA, and DSA were performed of 49 dysfunctional hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and 32 grafts. The vascular tree of the accesses was divided into three to eight segments depending on the access type (arteriovenous fistula or arteriovenous graft) and the length of venous outflow. CDUS was performed and assessed by a vascular technician, whereas CE-MRA and DSA were interpreted by two magnetic resonance radiologists and two interventional radiologists, respectively. All readers were blinded to information from each other and from other studies. DSA was used as reference standard for stenosis detection.\nDSA detected 111 significant (> or = 50%) stenoses in 433 vascular segments. Sensitivity and specificity of CDUS for the detection of significant stenosed vessel segments were 91% (95% CI, 84%-95%) and 97% (95% CI, 94%-98%), respectively. We found a positive predictive value of 91% (95% CI, 84%-95%) and a negative predictive value of 97% (95% CI, 94%-98%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRA were 96% (95% CI, 90%-98%), 98% (95% CI, 96%-99%), 94% (95% CI, 88%-97%), and 98% (95% CI, 96%-99%), respectively. CDUS and CE-MRA depicted respectively three and four significant stenoses in six nondiagnostic DSA segments. The interventionalist would have chosen an alternative cannulation site in 38% of patients if the CDUS results had been available.\nWe suggest that CDUS be used as initial imaging modality of dysfunctional shunts, but complete access should be depicted at DSA and angioplasty to detect all significant stenoses eligible for intervention. CE-MRA should be considered only if DSA is inconclusive.",

This study investigated the external pressure necessary to narrow and occlude leg veins in different body positions.\nIn nine healthy volunteers and five patients with incompetent small saphenous veins, the diameter of the small saphenous veins and of one posterior tibial vein was measured at the mid level of the calf by duplex ultrasound scans in sitting, standing, and supine positions. A modified blood pressure cuff with an acetate window that permitted ultrasound visualization of the veins was gradually inflated, and the pressures needed to narrow or occlude the veins were recorded.\nInitial narrowing occurs with a median pressure of between 30 and 40 mm Hg in the sitting and standing positions. Complete occlusion of superficial and deep leg veins occurs with 20 to 25 mm Hg in the supine position, between 50 and 60 mm Hg in the sitting position, and at about 70 mm Hg in the standing position.

    "abstract": "To assess the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients enrolled in a national, multicenter database.\nThis was a retrospective, cohort study that randomly selected VTE patients from 38 academic/teaching, community, and Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals. The study included a physician survey component. The patients selected were those treated between January 2002 and June 2003 who had an ICD-9-CM code for pulmonary embolus (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pregnancy-related PE or DVT.\nThe study included 939 patients: 52.7% with DVT, 28.4% with PE, and 18.8% with PE and DVT. Mean age was 59.5 years. Risk factors included obesity (body mass index > 30) in 30.1%, history of VTE in 28.0%, malignancy in 27.4%, surgery in 21.1%, and immobility in 18.5%. Only 56.1% of patients were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Bridging from LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH) to warfarin was completed during hospitalization in 486 (68.6%), but only 246 (50.6%) had an international normalized ratio (INR) > or = 2 for 48 hours before discontinuation of the injectable anticoagulant. Length of stay in patients discharged on bridge therapy was 4.0 +/- 3.7 days vs 8.1 +/- 5.8 days for patients discharged on warfarin therapy (P < .001). Ninety-two (10.1%) patients were discharged with neither oral nor injectable anticoagulation and had a mean duration of treatment of only 10.6 +/- 16.2 days. Of 245 physicians surveyed from participating hospitals, 84% and 53%, respectively, indicated that LMWH was their preferred agent for treatment of DVT and treatment of PE. With regard to warfarin, 30% did not believe it was necessary to have a therapeutic INR for > or = 2 days before discontinuing LMWH or UFH, and 27% responded that it was necessary to keep DVT patients in the hospital until they were therapeutic.\nIn this cross-section of United States hospitals, lower than anticipated use of LMWH, insufficient bridging from UFH or LMWH to warfarin, and continuation of anticoagulation after hospitalization were all problems discovered with the treatment of VTE. Physician knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs are partially responsible for the gap between actual practice and international guidelines. These results suggest that hospitals should evaluate their adherence to international VTE treatment guidelines and develop strategies to optimize antithrombotic therapy.",

Risk factors included obesity (body mass index > 30) in 30.1%, history of VTE in 28.0%, malignancy in 27.4%, surgery in 21.1%, and immobility in 18.5%. Only 56.1% of patients were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Bridging from LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH) to warfarin was completed during hospitalization in 486 (68.6%), but only 246 (50.6%) had an international normalized ratio (INR) > or = 2 for 48 hours before discontinuation of the injectable anticoagulant. Length of stay in patients discharged on bridge therapy was 4.0 +/- 3.7 days vs 8.1 +/- 5.8 days for patients discharged on warfarin therapy (P < .001). Ninety-two (10.1%) patients were discharged with neither oral nor injectable anticoagulation and had a mean duration of treatment of only 10.6 +/- 16.2 days. Of 245 physicians surveyed from participating hospitals, 84% and 53%, respectively, indicated that LMWH was their preferred agent for treatment of DVT and treatment of PE. With regard to warfarin, 30% did not believe it was necessary to have a therapeutic INR for > or = 2 days before discontinuing LMWH or UFH, and 27% responded that it was necessary to keep DVT patients in the hospital until they were therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "By acutely enhancing the arterial leg inflow, intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) improves the walking ability, arterial hemodynamics, and quality of life of claudicants. We quantified the duration of acute leg inflow enhancement with IPC of the foot (IPC(foot)), calf (IPC(calf)), or both (IPC(foot+calf)) and its amplitude decay in claudicants and controls in relation to the pulsatility index, an estimate of peripheral resistance. These findings are cross-correlated with the features of the three implicated physiologic mechanisms: (1) an increase in the arteriovenous pressure gradient, (2) suspension of peripheral sympathetic autoregulation, and (3) enhanced release of nitric oxide with flow and shear-stress increase.\nTwenty-six limbs of 24 claudicants with superficial femoral artery occlusion or stenoses (>75%) and 24 limbs of 20 healthy controls matched for age and sex, meeting stringent selection criteria, had their popliteal volume flow and pulsating index (peak-to-peak velocity/mean velocity) measured with duplex scanning at rest and upon delivery of IPC. Spectral waveforms were analyzed for 50 seconds after IPC delivery per 5-second segments. The three IPC modes were applied in a true crossover design. Data analysis was performed with the Page, Friedman, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney and chi2 tests.\nThe median duration of flow enhancement in claudicants exceeded 50 seconds with IPC(foot), IPC(calf), and IPC(foot+calf) but was shorter (P < .001) in the controls (32.5 to 40 seconds). Among the three IPC modes, the duration of flow enhancement differed (P < .05) only between IPC(foot) and IPC(foot+calf). After reaching its peak within 5 seconds of IPC, flow enhancement decayed at rates decreasing over time (trend, P < .05, Page test), which in both groups were highest at 5 to 20 seconds, moderate at 20 to 35 seconds, and lowest at 35 to 50 seconds (P < .05, Friedman test). Baseline and peak flow with all IPC modes was similar between the two groups. Pulsatility index attenuation in claudicating limbs lasted a median 32.5 seconds with IPC(foot), 37.5 seconds with IPC(calf), and 40 seconds with IPC(foot+calf); duration of pulsatility index attenuation was shorter in the control limbs with IPC(foot) (30 seconds), IPC(calf) (32.5 seconds), or IPC(foot+calf) (35 seconds), yet differences, as well as those among the 3 IPC modes, were not significant.\nLeg inflow enhancement with IPC exceeds 50 seconds in claudicants and lasts 32.5 to 40 seconds in the controls. Peak flow occurs concurrently with maximal pulsatility index attenuation, within 5 seconds of IPC. Irrespective of group or IPC mode, the decay rate (%) of flow enhancement is highest within 5 to 20 seconds of IPC, moderate at 20 to 35 seconds, and lowest at 35 to 50 seconds. Since attenuation in peripheral resistance terminates with the mid time period (20 to 35 seconds) of flow decay, and nitric oxide has a half-life of <7 to 10 seconds, the study's data indicate that all implicated physiologic mechanisms (1, 2, and 3) are likely active immediately after IPC delivery (0 to 20 sec) and all but nitric oxide are effective in the mid time period (20 to 35 seconds). As the pulsatility index has returned to baseline, the late phase of flow enhancement (35 to 50 seconds) could be attributable to the declining arteriovenous pressure gradient alone.",

    "abstract": "Traditional teaching assumes that the distal arterial tree is maximally dilated in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Endovascular or arterial bypass procedures are the commonly used interventions to increase distal perfusion. However, other forms of treatment such as spinal cord stimulation or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) have been shown to improve limb salvage rates. This prospective study was designed to determine if the use of IPC increases popliteal, gastrocnemial, collateral arterial, and skin blood flow in patients with CLI.\nTwenty limbs with CLI in 20 patients (mean age, 74 years) were evaluated with duplex ultrasound scans and laser Doppler fluxmetry in the semi-erect position before, during, and after IPC. One pneumatic cuff was applied on the foot and the other on the calf. The maximum inflation pressure was 120 mm Hg and was applied for 3 seconds at three cycles per minute. All patients had at least two-level disease by arteriography. Fourteen limbs were characterized as inoperable, and six were considered marginal for reconstruction. Flow volumes were measured in the popliteal, medial gastrocnemial, and a genicular collateral artery. Skin blood flux was measured on the dorsum of the foot at the same time.\nSignificant flow increase during the application of IPC was found in all three arteries (18/20 limbs) compared with baseline values (P < .02). The highest change was seen in the popliteal, followed by the gastrocnemial and the collateral artery. After the cessation of IPC, the flow returned to baseline. This was attributed to the elevation of time average velocity, as the diameter of the arteries remained unchanged. The skin blood flux increased significantly as well (P < .03). In the two limbs without an increase in the arterial or skin blood flow, significant popliteal vein reflux was found. Both limbs were amputated shortly after.\nIPC increases axial, muscular, collateral, and skin blood flow in patients with CLI and may be beneficial to those who are not candidates for revascularization. Patients with significant venous reflux may not benefit from IPC. This supports the theory that one of the mechanisms by which IPC enhances flow is by increasing the arteriovenous pressure gradient.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this randomized trial was to compare the efficacy of a low-intensity exercise rehabilitation program vs a high-intensity program in changing physical function, peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients limited by intermittent claudication.\nThirty-one patients randomized to low-intensity exercise rehabilitation and 33 patients randomized to high-intensity exercise rehabilitation completed the study. The 6-month exercise rehabilitation programs consisted of intermittent treadmill walking to near maximal claudication pain 3 days per week at either 40% (low-intensity group) or 80% (high-intensity group) of maximal exercise capacity. Total work performed in the two training regimens was similar by having the patients in the low-intensity group exercise for a longer duration than patients in the high-intensity group. Measurements of physical function, peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life were obtained on each patient before and after the rehabilitation programs.\nAfter the exercise rehabilitation programs, patients in the two groups had similar improvements in these measures. Initial claudication distance increased by 109% in the low-intensity group (P < .01) and by 109% in the high-intensity group (P < .01), and absolute claudication distance increased by 61% (P < 0.01) and 63% (P < .01) in the low-intensity and high-intensity groups, respectively. Furthermore, both exercise programs elicited improvements (P < .05) in peak oxygen uptake, ischemic window, and health-related quality of life.\nThe efficacy of low-intensity exercise rehabilitation is similar to high-intensity rehabilitation in improving markers of functional independence in PAD patients limited by intermittent claudication, provided that a few additional minutes of walking is accomplished to elicit a similar volume of exercise.",

    "abstract": "African Americans (AAs) are at risk for developing diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Whether race influences the results of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of autogenous infrainguinal bypasses in AAs and Caucasians to determine the association of race with graft function and limb salvage.\nThis was a retrospective, comparative cohort study of AA and Caucasian patients who had undergone autogenous infrainguinal bypass surgery. Only single-limb bypasses in each patient cohort were considered in this analysis. In patients who had undergone bilateral lower limb bypasses, the first limb bypass was chosen as the index bypass procedure.\nFrom January 1985 to December 2003, 1459 autogenous infrainguinal bypasses were performed in 1459 patients for lower limb ischemia. Within this group, 89 AA patients/vein grafts formed the study cohort. The control group comprised 1370 Caucasian patients/vein grafts. Compared with the Caucasian cohort, AA patients were significantly younger (median age, 65 vs 70 years, respectively; P = .001) and predominantly female (57% vs 41%, respectively; P = .002). AA patients also had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, and dialysis-dependent renal failure. More AA than Caucasian patients presented with gangrene (34% vs 16%, respectively; P = .001), and more underwent bypass surgery for limb salvage indications (91% vs 81%, respectively; P = .01). The venous conduit used was predominantly the greater saphenous vein (AA, 83%; Caucasian, 85%), and the site of distal anastomosis was at the tibial/pedal level in 67% of AA and 61% of Caucasian patients. Overall morbidity (AA, 28%; Caucasian, 23%) and 30-day mortality (AA, 3%; Caucasian, 3%) were similar. Thirty-day graft failure was significantly greater in AAs than Caucasians (12% vs 5%, respectively; P = .003). The overall 5-year primary graft patency (+/-SE) was significantly worse in AA patients (AA, 52% +/- 6%; Caucasian, 67% +/- 2%; P = .009). The 5-year limb salvage rate (+/-SE) was also significantly worse in AA patients (AA, 81% +/- 5%; Caucasian, 90% +/- 1%; P = .04). With the Cox proportional hazard model, significant risk factors associated with primary graft failure were AA race, age younger than 65 years, female sex, secondary reconstructions, tibial bypasses, and critical limb ischemia. Significant risk factors associated with limb loss were age younger than 65 years, female sex, absence of coronary disease, presence of critical limb ischemia, and secondary reconstructions.\nAutogenous infrainguinal bypass surgery in AAs is associated with poorer primary graft patency and limb salvage rates compared with those of Caucasians. This may partially account for the higher rate of limb loss in AA patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Reperfusion of the limb after acute and persistent ischemia is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality despite complete revascularization. Although reperfusion is a prerequisite for maintaining limb function, it may in itself cause further injury. There is experimental evidence that modification of the initial reperfusion modalities can minimize this reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that controlled reperfusion using a simple blood bag perfusion system reduces reperfusion injury and facilitates the return of normal function.\nFifteen consecutive patients (mean age, 80.5 +/- 5.0 years) with severe, acute lower-limb ischemia were allocated to two treatment arms in this prospective, controlled observational study. Group I (n = 8) underwent surgical embolectomy alone, and group II (n = 7) underwent surgical embolectomy plus controlled reperfusion using a simplified perfusion system. Indication for controlled reperfusion was made by the responsible surgeon. Controlled reperfusion consisted of a 30-minute infusion of a crystalloid reperfusion solution that was mixed with oxygenated blood (the blood:reperfusion solution ratio was 6:1) distal to the occlusion. Duration of ischemia, postoperative amputation rate, motor function of the ischemic limb, and pre- and postoperative serum creatine kinase levels were assessed.\nThe duration of ischemia was 10.7 +/- 1.1 hours in group I and 19 +/- 5.2 hours in group II (P < .05). The site of the arterial occlusion was the iliac artery in nine patients and the common femoral artery in six patients. Full recovery was achieved in six of seven patients in group II and in only two of eight patients in group I (P < .05). There were three in-hospital deaths in group I, and two patients underwent major amputations. No in-hospital deaths or major amputations occurred in group II.\nThe results from this preliminary study strongly suggest the hypothesis that the results of conventional embolectomy for acute, severe lower-limb ischemia can be improved by controlled reperfusion. To prove our preliminary findings, a large randomized, prospective, controlled, multicenter trial, the Controlled Reperfusion of the Acutely Ischemic Limb trial (CRAIL-Trial) is currently being conducted to prove our preliminary findings.",

    "abstract": "A carotid artery stump pressure (SP) of < 50 mm Hg and abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) changes have been suggested as indications for selective shunting in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under general anesthesia. We attempted to determine the optimal SP threshold that correlated with neurologic changes in awake patients undergoing CEA using cervical block anesthesia (CBA) and performed a cost comparison with EEG monitoring.\nBetween July 1, 1995, and December 31, 2004, SP was measured during 474 CEAs performed under CBA by inserting a 19-gauge butterfly needle into the common carotid artery. A saline-filled intravenous bag in the patient's contralateral hand was connected to pressure tubing to generate waveforms with hand squeezing that could be visualized on a monitor. Systemic pressure was maintained approximately 10 mm Hg higher than baseline. Accurate SPs were confirmed by the finding of flatline waveforms after internal carotid artery clamping. Selective shunting was performed when neurologic changes occurred (aphasia, inability to squeeze the contralateral hand, decreased consciousness), regardless of SP. During this same period, 142 patients underwent CEA using GA, and SP was also measured.\nShunting was necessary because of neurologic changes in 7.2% (34/474) of all CEAs performed using CBA: 0.9% (3/335) with SPs > or = 50 mm Hg systolic vs 1.0% (4/402) with SPs > or = 40 mm Hg systolic, and 22% (31/139) with SPs < 50 mm Hg systolic vs 42% (30/72) with SPs < 40 mm Hg systolic. If these 474 CEAs had been performed using GA, shunts would have been used in 29% (139/474) of patients for a SP < 50 mm Hg systolic vs 15% (72/474) for a SP < 40 mm Hg systolic. In patients not shunted, the perioperative stroke/death rate was 1.2% in patients (4/332) with SPs > or = 50 mm Hg vs 1.0% (4/398) with SPs > or = 40 mm Hg. Three of the four strokes occurred > 24 hours postoperatively and were unrelated to lack of shunting and ischemia. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with SPs > or = 50 mm Hg who underwent CEA using CBA (70%, 335/474) vs GA (67%, 96/142) during this time period. At our hospital, charges for SPe measurement, including anesthesia charges and tubing, were 229 dollars per case vs 3439 dollars per case for EEG monitoring. Use of SP measurements in these 474 patients would have resulted in reduced charges of 1,521,540 dollars compared with EEG monitoring if CEA had been performed under GA.\nUsing 40 mm Hg systolic as a threshold, the need for shunting (15%) and the false-negative rate (1.0%) for SP in our series were equivalent to the results of EEG monitoring during CEA reported in the literature. However, charges for SP measurements are dramatically lower compared with EEG monitoring. Our results suggest that a carotid artery SP > or = 40 mm Hg systolic may be considered as an equally reliable but more cost-effective method to predict the need for carotid shunting during CEA under GA compared with EEG monitoring, but further investigation is warranted.",

All CT angiograms were retrospectively reviewed to determine the presence and laterality of persistent sciatic artery and its associated vascular abnormalities, such as aneurysm, thrombus, distal thromboembolism, and atherosclerotic change. The relationship of persistent sciatic artery with adjacent structures, such as sciatic nerve, muscle, accompanying vein, and femoral artery, as well as the presence of other anomalies, was analyzed. Clinical data regarding the presenting symptoms and hospital course were obtained from patient charts.\nSix persistent sciatic arteries, with or without occlusion, were identified in five female patients (age range, 54 to 80 years). CT angiography revealed unilateral persistent sciatic artery in four patients (left, 3; right, 1) and bilateral persistent sciatic artery in one patient. Aneurysm was present in two (mean size, 26 mm x 20 mm), thrombosis in three, and distal thromboembolism in all six persistent sciatic arteries. All persistent sciatic arteries coursed along the sciatic nerve and continued as popliteal artery. Characteristically, in all these instances, the superficial femoral arteries were hypoplastic and tapered smoothly. Anomalous popliteal venous drainage was noted in all ipsilateral limbs with persistent sciatic artery and even in contralateral limbs with normal superficial femoral artery in all but one.\nCT angiography enables the detection of persistent sciatic artery even in the presence of complete occlusion and is useful in the comprehensive evaluation of various complications and associated venous anomalies. It can potentially be used as the sole imaging modality for persistent sciatic artery.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to report our experience in the surgical treatment of arterial aneurysms in patients with Beh\u00e7et disease.\nFrom October 2001 through May 2004, 18 arterial aneurysms were diagnosed in 16 Beh\u00e7et patients. All patients were male. The patients ranged in age from 24 to 52 years (mean, 37.4 +/- 5.2 years). There were six abdominal aortic, three common femoral, two iliac, two popliteal, two superficial femoral, and two anterior tibial aneurysms and one subclavian artery aneurysm. All patients but four were in remission at the time of diagnosis. Those 4 patients received immunosuppressive therapy before the surgical intervention to induce remission. After hospital discharge, all patients were followed up regularly at 3-month intervals. The mean duration of follow-up was 17 +/- 4.2 months (range, 6-24 months).\nAll patients underwent a successful surgical intervention. During the study period, we performed five aortic tube graft interpositions, two aortofemoral bypasses, one aortobifemoral bypass, three common femoral artery graft interpositions, and two femoropopliteal bypasses. The popliteal artery (n = 2), anterior tibial artery (n = 2), and subclavian artery (n = 1) aneurysms were repaired primarily. There was no in-hospital mortality. One patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm had to undergo reoperation because of postoperative bleeding. The postoperative hospital stay was 8.5 +/- 4.3 days. Two patients were lost to follow-up. During the follow-up period, two false aneurysms of the common femoral artery were repaired with a graft interposition procedure. Another patient who had undergone an aortic tube graft interposition was readmitted 9 months later with an external iliac artery aneurysm. The external iliac artery was ligated through a retroperitoneal approach, and femorofemoral bypass was performed. In addition, one femoropopliteal interposition graft was occluded, without disabling ischemia.\nAlthough aneurysmal disease is rare in Beh\u00e7et disease, it can complicate the clinical picture and cause life-threatening complications. We believe that the establishment of remission before the surgical intervention decreases the incidence of postoperative complications. Because recurrence at the site of anastomosis is possible, prolonged monitoring is required.",

    "abstract": "The femoropopliteal vein (FPV) graft has been used extensively for large-caliber vascular reconstructions. To date, there have been no reports of anastomotic dehiscence or rupture leading to graft-associated hemorrhage (GAH). In the present report, we review our experience with GAH from FPV grafts to determine the incidence of this problem, to better understand the etiology, and to determine potential methods to prevent this complication.\nAll patients undergoing arterial reconstructions with FPV grafts were entered into a registry that included demographics, operative details, complications, and follow-up information. Episodes of GAH that occurred during the period from 1990 to 2004 were studied to determine etiologic factors and outcomes.\nDuring the study period, 574 FPV grafts were used for arterial reconstructions in 364 patients. GAH occurred in 11 patients (3%). Onset of GAH ranged from 1 hour to 180 days after operation. The mean blood transfusion requirement for GAH was 10 +/- 4 units. In three patients, the etiology of GAH was purely technical, resulting in a slipped or \"popped\" tie from a large side branch. In eight patients, the etiology was due to graft disruption secondary to uncontrolled infection and failure of anastomotic healing. Most of these patients were being treated for aortic graft infection. Special risk factors for this complication included malnutrition, ongoing polymicrobial and fungal infections, immunocompromised state, active cancer, steroid treatment, and ongoing graft contamination from gastrointestinal or pharyngeal leaks. Outcomes included four deaths and one stroke.\nGAH is a serious complication with high morbidity, mortality, and transfusion requirements. Although technical problems are preventable, FPV grafts, like all biologic grafts, can develop disruption with GAH from ongoing infection, especially in severely immunocompromised patients who are malnourished and have poor healing ability. Strategies for prevention and alternative treatment modalities are appropriate in patients at high risk for GAH.",

Presenting symptoms included gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 25), sepsis and retroperitoneal abscess (n = 3), and ruptured para-anastomotic aneurysm (n = 1). One third (10/29) of patients were hypotensive at presentation. Repair was accomplished by graft excision with axillobifemoral bypass (17 simultaneous, 8 staged), graft excision with in situ deep vein replacement (n = 2), or graft excision with rifampin-treated prosthetic replacement (n = 2). Mean follow-up was 51 months, and the incidence of late events was reported by life table methods.\nThe operative (< or = 30-day) mortality rate was 21%, with shock at presentation (P < .01), the need for preoperative transfusion (P < .01), and use of suprarenal aortic clamping during aortoenteric fistula repair (P = .03) associated with lethal outcome. Cumulative mortality related to aortoenteric fistula management was only 24% within an overall 5-year survival rate of 61%. Freedom from recurrent infection or amputation was 86% and 88% at 5 years, respectively, and assisted graft patency was 79%. Presence of staphylococcal species in 22% of patients and occasional operative findings of adjacent perigraft \"biofilm\" suggests that underlying indolent graft infection may contribute to the development of aortoenteric fistula in some cases.\nOutcomes associated with aortoenteric fistula repair were surprisingly favorable in the absence of preoperative hemodynamic instability.",

    "abstract": "Nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression after abdominal surgery is still largely used to prevent nausea and vomiting. However, indications are based more on practice than on studies. Moreover, prolonged NGT decompression can lead to complications. In this prospective and randomized study, we evaluated the effects of early withdrawal of NGTs in patients undergoing surgery of the infrarenal aorta.\nBetween October 2001 and May 2002, consecutive patients underwent scheduled infrarenal aortic operations. Patients were prospectively randomised into two groups: group 1, NGT maintenance until the passage of flatus; and group 2, NGT removal at the time of tracheal extubation. Preoperative and perioperative data were collected. The main end point was the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. Secondary end points were tolerance of NGT withdrawal and postoperative complications. Criteria were compared between groups by using Mann-Whitney or Fisher exact tests.\nForty-six patients underwent aortic operations. Six patients were subsequently excluded from the study. Of the 40 randomized subjects, 20 patients were included in each group. Preoperative and intraoperative data were similar in both groups. There was no statistical difference between groups regarding nausea and vomiting. In group 1, the occurrence of respiratory complications was more frequent compared with group 2 (5 vs 0 complications; P = .023). There was no significant difference in intensive care unit stay, but the hospital stay was shorter in group 2 (mean, 9 +/- 3 days vs 15 +/- 9 days; P = .016). There were no differences in other adverse events.\nThis study does not support a significant effect of early removal of NGTs on nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing open repair of the infrarenal aorta. However, these findings suggest that NGT maintenance increases the risk of respiratory complications and the length of hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "The life expectancy of patients with oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is significantly reduced, but the risk of any intervention is considered prohibitive. However, severe COPD may increase the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture. We reviewed our experience with AAA repair in oxygen-dependent patients to determine whether operative risk and expected long-term survival justify surgical intervention.\nA retrospective review of 44 consecutive patients with oxygen-dependent COPD undergoing AAA repair over an 8-year period was performed. Information was recorded for survival, length of follow-up, patient age, medical comorbidities, pulmonary function tests, and operative approach. Survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with published cohorts of oxygen-dependent patients and the natural history of untreated aneurysms.\nTwenty-four patients underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and 20 underwent open procedures (14 retroperitoneal and 6 transabdominal). The mean AAA diameter was 6.1 cm (range, 5-9.5 cm). The mean age was 71.4 years, and 82% of patients were male. Operative mortality was 0%. The mean length of stay was 11.2 days for open procedures and 4.3 days for EVAR (significantly longer than that for standard-risk patients). The mean survival time was 37.9 months (range, 2-91 months). Preoperative medical comorbidities, type of repair, and pulmonary function tests were not predictive of survival. Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher with open repair. Long term survival was comparable to historical series of the natural history of O2 dependent patients without AAA but better than untreated 6 cm AAA cohorts. At 42 months, almost 50% of patients in our study group were still alive, compared to 20% survival at 34 months for those with untreated 6 cm AAAs.\nIt is reasonable to continue to offer AAA repair to home oxygen-dependent COPD patients who are ambulatory and medically optimized and who are without untreated coronary artery disease. Although EVAR may be the most suitable treatment for oxygen-dependent COPD patients, our results show that even open repair may be safely performed in this population, with acceptable results.",

    "abstract": "Interventional radiologists, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons are capable of performing endovascular procedures successfully in their respective environments. Suboptimal anatomy or intraoperative technical problems can be encountered, and endovascular management alone is not always suitable. The objectives of this study were to define the incidence of adjunctive surgical techniques, to discuss the rationale for endovascular reconstruction in a well-developed surgical environment, and to assess the effect of experience on the incidence of adjunctive repair.\nAll primary aortic and aortoiliac elective, urgent, and emergent endovascular procedures performed at the Peter Lougheed Center and entered into a prospective database from May 25, 1999 to June 01, 2005, were reviewed. All adjunctive surgical techniques to enable stent deployment, enhance attachment site, or solve intraoperative difficulties were captured. The study period was divided into two time periods based on learning curve data to assess the effect of experience on the rate of adjunctive repairs.\nFour hundred thirty-eight patients underwent elective (80%), urgent (15%), or emergent (5%) endovascular procedures during the study period. These consisted of 101 thoracic and 337 abdominal operations, including the use of 13 fenestrated stents. One hundred thirty-nine patients (31.7%) required 180 open surgical procedures. Complete data were available for the entire patient cohort. The mean follow-up was 793.2 days (SD, 519.1 days). Procedures were necessary for vascular access, arterial dissection/rupture, limb ischemia, and enhancement/elongation of the stent attachment site. The persistent endoleak rate was 5.3%, the late rupture rate was 0.7%, the conversion rate was 1.6%, the 30-day surgical mortality rate was 3.2%, all-cause mortality to date is 7.3%, and the reintervention rate was 4.6%. There was no statistically significant effect of the learning curve on the incidence of surgical adjunctive procedures in either the thoracic group (11/26 [42.3%] for phase 1 vs 17/75 [22.6%] for phase 2) or the abdominal group (14/50 [28.0%] for phase 1 vs 97/287 [33.8%] for phase 2). Overall, 31.5% of patients required adjunctive surgical repair.\nSuccessful endografting requires endovascular expertise in addition to a well-developed surgical environment to increase applicability and decrease patient risk. Despite advances in endovascular technology, hybrid techniques will continue to be required to achieve good overall success rates.",

    "abstract": "Proximal neck dilatation (PND) and/or endograft migration with the subsequent development of type I endoleak is a significant cause of late endograft failure after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Although there are numerous reports examining PND in patients receiving endografts that use self-expanding stents (SES) for proximal fixation, there are no such reports for patients treated with endografts that use balloon-expanding stents (BES). The purpose of this study was to investigate PND and endograft migration after EVAR with BES endografts.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all charts and all serial computed tomographic scans available for patients who underwent EVAR with a BES endograft (surgeon-made, aortounifemoral polytetrafluoroethylene graft with a proximal Palmaz stent) between August 1997 and October 2002. Only patients with longer than a 12-month follow-up were analyzed. Neck diameter was measured at the level of the lowest renal artery and at 5 mm below it. PND was defined as neck enlargement of 2.5 mm or more. To assess endograft migration, the distance between the superior mesenteric artery and the cranial end of the BES was measured. Stent migration was defined as a change of 5 mm or more.\nA total of 77 patients received this device during the study period. The technical success rate was 99%. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 66%, 48%, and 29.5%, respectively. Complete serial computed tomographic scans were available in 41 of the 48 patients who survived 12 months or longer after the operation. The mean follow-up period for these patients was 31 months (range, 12-66 months). The maximum aneurysm diameter was either unchanged or decreased in 35 patients (85%). The immediate postoperative proximal neck diameter was 19 to 29 mm (median, 24 mm). This was unchanged at the latest follow-up. None of the patients had significant PND. The cranial end of the BES was located in the area between 14 mm proximal and 36 mm distal to the superior mesenteric artery (median, 6 mm). None of the patients developed significant endograft migration.\nNeither PND nor endograft migration was observed with the BES endograft. The nature of the SES may be responsible for the observed neck dilatation and device migration after EVAR with SES endografts. This study suggests that BES may be a better fixation method for EVAR.",

We report herein a review of all patients initially enrolled in multicenter US clinical trials of the Excluder endograft who underwent secondary conversion to open surgical repair.\nClinical data and relevant medical records of patients enrolled in phase I and II multicenter US clinical trials of the Excluder endograft were retrospectively reviewed for adverse events and further narrowed to those patients who underwent secondary operative conversion. Hospital records, operative and anesthesia reports, and all imaging studies were analyzed at initial implantation and at the time of subsequent open surgical repair.\nLate open conversion was performed in 16 (2.7%) of the 594 patients enrolled in the Excluder clinical trials. Presumed endotension accounted for 8 of 16 of secondary conversions. In two of these patients, however, an endoleak was identified at the time of open surgical repair. Of the remaining eight patients, two underwent conversion for device infection, five for persistent endoleak, and one for aneurysm rupture. The overall 30-day mortality was 6.25% (1/16), with one death occurring in a patient with a ruptured aneurysm. Of patients who underwent conversion because of endotension, the maximal abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter (mean +/- SD) at the time of initial implantation and subsequent graft removal was 61 +/- 11 mm and 70 +/- 10 mm, respectively. The mean time to open conversion for treatment of endotension was 37 +/- 12 months (range, 20-50 months; median, 42 months). Freedom from conversion was 98.6% and 96.7% at 24 and 48 months, respectively.\nEndotension in the absence of a demonstrable endoleak has been a major indication for late surgical conversion in patients treated with the Excluder endograft. Given the potential presence of an undetected endoleak and the possible effects of progressive sac enlargement on long-term device stability, continued close surveillance of patients with assumed endotension is required. Should changes in device design eliminate endotension, a further reduction in the already low incidence of late open conversion of the Excluder endograft can be anticipated.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the early and late outcome after endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) in octogenarians compared with patients aged < 80 years.\nPatients treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with endovascular repair during the period 1996 to 2004 were collated in the EUROSTAR registry. This study group consisted of 697 patients aged > or = 80 years. Comparison was made with 4198 patients aged < 80 years with regard to the incidence of preoperative characteristics and outcomes of the procedure.\nThe proportion of octogenarians treated by EVAR increased during the study period, from 11% in the first year to 18% in the last year. Octogenarians more frequently had cardiac disease, impaired renal function, and pulmonary disease (P = .03, P < .0001 and P = .0001). Thirty-two percent of the octogenarians were recorded unfit for open surgery as opposed to 22% in younger patients (P < .0001); they also had a larger aneurysm diameter (62 vs 58 mm, respectively; P < .0001). The 30-day and in-hospital mortality in octogenarians was 5% vs 2% in the younger group (P < .0001). More device-related complications and systemic complications, including cardiac disease, were noted in octogenarians (7% vs 5% and 19% vs 11%, P = .03 and P < .0001, respectively). This group of patients also had a higher incidence of postoperative hemorrhagic complications, including hematoma (7% vs 3%, P < .0001, respectively). No differences in conversion to open repair and post-EVAR rupture rate were observed. Aneurysm-related mortality and late all-cause mortality was 7% vs 3% and 10% vs 7%, both P < .0001.\nOur study supports that EVAR might be considered when treating elderly patients, provided their aneurysms are anatomically suited for the endovascular technique. The risk for late complications compared with open repair may be outweighed by a lower early mortality as well as a shorter time for physical recovery.",

    "abstract": "To report our early experience with endovascular treatment of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs).\nBetween March 1998 and October 2004, 40 consecutive patients with an RAAA presented to our unit; 38 underwent assessment by computed tomography, whereas 2 died on arrival before any assessment and treatment was possible. Twenty-three patients (61%) were suitable for stent grafting, and all proceeded to endovascular repair. Of these, 17 underwent operation with local anesthesia, 1 did so under general anesthesia, and a further 5 procedures were commenced under local anesthesia and converted to general anesthesia. A total of 14 bifurcated and 10 aortouni-iliac stent grafts were implanted; in 1 patient, the bifurcated graft was converted to an aortouni-iliac repair during surgery because of technical difficulties.\nStent-graft deployment in the intended location without a type I or III endoleak was technically successful in 22 of the 23 patients. There were no conversions to open surgery. The 30-day mortality was 39%. Six patients died immediately or soon after the procedure because of severe hypovolemic shock, and three died within 30 days from cardiac causes. After surgery, 13 complications were encountered in 10 patients (3 cardiac, 4 respiratory, 5 renal, and 1 implant related). Two patients required reintervention--one for a type I endoleak and one for limb occlusion. There were 14 survivors. During a median follow-up of 410 days (range, 90-1650 days), 2 more patients died from myocardial infarction, and 9 remain well; 3 patients were lost to follow-up. There were three secondary interventions (two for type I endoleak and one for stent-graft thrombosis).\nEndovascular treatment of RAAAs is feasible, and the early experience is promising. More experience and evidence from randomized trials are needed to determine whether such an approach is superior to open surgery.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia is a rare complication after open surgical repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). The use of emergency endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (eEVAR) is increasing, and paraplegia has been observed in a few patients. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence and pathogenesis of spinal cord ischemia after eEVAR in greater detail.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of patients who had eEVAR for rAAA in three hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium during a 3-year study period that ended in February 2004. The use of aortouniiliac devices combined with a femorofemoral crossover bypass was the preferred technique. Patients with postoperative symptoms of spinal cord ischemia were identified and the influence of potential risk factors was assessed. These factors included the presence of common iliac artery aneurysms necessitating device limb extension to the external iliac artery with associated overlapping the hypogastric artery, the prolonged interruption of bilateral hypogastric artery arterial inflow during the procedure (defined \"functional aortic occlusion time\" >30 minutes), and the occurrence of preoperative hemodynamic shock.\nThirty-five patients were treated by EVAR and they constituted the study group. The first-month mortality in the study group with EVAR was 23%. Four patients (11.5%) with EVAR developed paraplegia postoperatively; the unilateral or bilateral hypogastric artery in all four patients became occluded during the procedure. In the other 31 patients who did not have paraplegia, the unilateral or bilateral hypogastric arteries became occluded in 14 patients (45%). This constituted a significant difference in the prevalence of hypogastric artery occlusion in patients with or without paraplegia (P = .04). The functional aortic occlusion time was prolonged in all four patients with paraplegia and in five without spinal cord ischemia (P = .0003). All four patients with spinal cord ischemia presented with hemodynamic shock. This factor did not reach a significant difference from nonparaplegic patients.\nEmergency EVAR continues to be a promising approach to reduce the high mortality of rAAA, but the incidence of spinal cord ischemia after endovascular treatment of rAAA was worrisome. Although the pathogenesis is most likely multifactorial, interruption of the hypogastric artery inflow appeared to have significant influence. In patients with aneurysmatic common iliac arteries, any effort should be made to minimize hypogastric occlusion time during the procedure and to maintain hypogastric artery inflow afterwards, either by the use of a bell-bottom iliac extension or by electing open repair.",

Six renal arteries and two superior mesenteric arteries were targeted for incorporation by graft fenestrations and branches. The fenestration/renal ostium interface was secured with balloon-expandable Genesis stents (n = 5) or Jostent stent grafts (n = 1). Completion angiography demonstrated no endoleaks and antegrade perfusion in all target vessels. During follow-up, one patient developed asymptomatic renal artery occlusion and underwent further endovascular intervention for type I distal endoleak. Computed tomography at 12 months demonstrated complete aneurysm exclusion in all patients with antegrade perfusion in the remaining target vessels. Fenestrated and branched endovascular stent grafts may be an acceptable alternative to conventional open repair in this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "We report three cases of symptomatic acute carotid thrombosis occurring after carotid artery stenting (CAS). CASE 1: A patient presented with crescendo transient ischemic attacks on the second day after CAS. Ultrasound images demonstrated incomplete in-stent thrombosis due to plaque protrusion. The urgent surgical procedure consisted of stent removal and carotid thromboendarterectomy. CASE 2: A case of complete thrombosis of a carotid stent occurred 4 days after implantation in a patient with essential thrombocythemia diagnosed by chance. The surgical strategy included stent removal and carotid thromboendarterectomy. CASE 3: Cardiac multiple embolisms in a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation caused concomitant leg ischemia and acute carotid stent occlusion 2 hours after CAS. Cerebral reperfusion was established by embolectomy, without removing the stent. At the same time, the right leg ischemia was resolved by a thromboembolectomy with a Fogarty catheter. These three cases demonstrate that acute thrombosis after carotid stenting can be managed successfully with emergent surgical intervention. Thromboendarterectomy with stent removal or in selected cases, simple thromboembolectomy, can minimize neurologic sequelae in patients suffering from acute post-stenting carotid thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The most widely used techniques for graft preservation after localized graft infections are muscle flap closure or antibacterial dressings and irrigations after d\u00e9bridement. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) has been increasingly used for complex wounds in vascular surgery, including groin infections, but not directly on exposed bypass grafts as a stand-alone technique. We used the VAC system after wound d\u00e9bridement in four patients with fully exposed synthetic bypass grafts who were too unstable or risky for further operative interventions. Mean duration of VAC use was 22.8 days (range, 6 to 53 days), with time to total wound closure of 30 to 63 days (mean, 41 days). There were no reinfections with 11 to 25 months' follow-up (mean, 18.3 months). For high-risk surgical patients with a fully exposed infected prosthetic vascular graft, VAC therapy along with aggressive d\u00e9bridement and antibiotic therapy may be an effective alternative to current management strategies.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that rapamycin coated onto, and eluted from, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts would diminish neointimal hyperplasia in a porcine model.\nRapamycin (also called sirolimus) was coated onto the luminal surface of 6-mm-internal-diameter thin-walled ePTFE grafts by using an adhesive polymer that allows timed release of the drug. An adhesive polymer that allows timed release of rapamycin from ePTFE was developed with commercially available chemicals and applied on 6-mm ePTFE grafts. Graft integrity was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and rapamycin levels were quantified by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Twenty-two mongrel pigs were randomized into three groups: untreated ePTFE (n = 6), adhesive-only coated ePTFE (n = 6), or adhesive- and rapamycin-coated ePTFE (n = 10). End-to-side unilateral aortoiliac bypasses were performed by using 6-mm-internal-diameter ePTFE grafts and standardized anastomotic lengths. Unilateral end-to-side aortoiliac ePTFE grafts (6-mm internal diameter) were inserted by using polypropylene sutures, 6-0 proximally and 7-0 distally; all anastomoses were 12 mm long. All animals received aspirin (325 mg orally) daily. All animals were given oral aspirin (325 mg) daily beginning on the day before surgery. At 28 days, the animals were killed, and the grafts were explanted in continuity with the adjacent aortic cuff and the outflow iliac artery. Variables compared between groups included graft patency, distal anastomotic length and cross-sectional narrowing, and intimal thickness at the arterial-graft junction indexed to the adjacent graft thickness. Microscopic analysis was performed with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome stains on paraffin sections. A pathologist blinded to experimental groups graded sections for collagen deposition, neointima formation, inflammatory cellular infiltrates, medial necrosis, and aneurysmal degeneration.\nAll animals survived until they were killed without clinical evidence of limb ischemia or graft infection. Preplanned t tests in the context of one-way analysis of variance showed no difference in outcome measures between the untreated ePTFE and adhesive-only coated ePTFE groups; therefore, they were combined in further comparisons with the adhesive- and rapamycin-coated ePTFE group. The Rapamycine eluting expanded polytetrafluoroethylene group had longer anastomoses (85.6% vs 60.6% of the initial anastomotic length maintained; P < .0001) and less cross-sectional narrowing in the outflow graft (16.2% vs 28.5%; P = .0007) when compared with the other two groups by using two-tailed Student t tests. There was no evidence of medial necrosis or aneurysmal degeneration. All patent grafts had complete endothelialization on hematoxylin and eosin sections. Rapamycin was detectable and quantifiable in the arterial wall at 28 days after implantation.\nRapamycin can be coated onto and eluted from ePTFE by using a nonionic polymer and a simple coating technique. At 4 weeks after implantation, the rapamycin-eluting ePTFE grafts demonstrate gross, pathologic, and morphometric features of diminished neointimal hyperplasia when compared with non-drug-eluting ePTFE. Four weeks after implantation in a porcine model, rapamycin-eluting ePTFE grafts demonstrated gross, pathologic, and morphometric features of diminished neointimal hyperplasia when compared with untreated and adhesive-only coated ePTFE grafts.\nRapamycin-eluting ePTFE grafts decrease neointimal hyperplasia in a porcine model. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether patency will be improved. Rapamycin-eluting ePTFE grafts may allow the use of prosthetic grafts in situations in which autologous vein is unavailable and in which neointimal hyperplasia is pronounced, such as in small-diameter (<6-mm) vessels typical of infrapopliteal interventions.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to assess the error and variability that results from human factors in Doppler peak velocity measurement. The positioning of the Doppler sample volume in the vessel, adjustment of the Doppler gain and angle, and choice of waveform display size were investigated. We hypothesized that even experienced vascular technologists in a laboratory accredited by the Intersocietal Commission for Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories make significant errors and have significant variability in the subjective adjustments made during measurements.\nProblems of patient variability were avoided by having the four technologists measure peak velocities from an in vitro pulsatile flow model with unstenosed and 61% stenosed tubes. To evaluate inaccurate angle and sample volume positioning, a probe holder was used in some of the experiments to fix the Doppler angle at 60 degrees. The effect of Doppler gain was studied at three settings--low, ideal, and saturated gains--that were standardized from the ideal level chosen by consensus amongst the technologists. Two waveform display sizes were also investigated. Peak velocity measurement was assessed by comparison with true peak velocities. For each variable studied, average peak velocities were calculated from the 10 measurements made by each technologist and used to find the percent error from the true value, and the coefficient of variation was used to measure the variability.\nDoppler angle, sample volume placement, and the Doppler gain were the most significant sources of error and variability. Inaccurate angle and placement increased the variability in measurements from 1% to 2% (range) to 4% to 6% for the straight tube and from 1% to 2% to 3% to 9% for the 61% stenosis. The peak velocity error was increased from 9% to 13% to 7% to 28% for the stenosis. Both measurement error and variability were strongly dependent on the Doppler gain level. At low gain, the error was approximately 10% less than the true value and at saturated gain, 20% greater. The display size only affected measurements from the stenosed tube, increasing the error from 9% to 13% to 15% to 24%.\nMajor factors affecting Doppler peak velocity measurement error and variability were identified. Inaccurate angle and sample volume placement increased the variability. The presence of a stenosis was found to increase the measurement errors. The error was found to depend on the Doppler gain setting, with greater variability at low and saturated gains and on the display size with a stenosis.\nDoppler ultrasound peak velocity measurements are widely used for the diagnostic assessment of the severity of arterial stenoses. However, it is known that these measurements are often in error. We have identified subjective human factors introduced by the technologist and assessed their contribution to peak velocity measurement error and variability. It is to be hoped that by understanding this, improvements in the machine design and measurement methods can be made that will result in improved measurement accuracy and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the risk of aneurysm sac rupture after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is estimated by using a group of anatomic variables. Available techniques for pressure monitoring include either direct measurement using catheter-based techniques or indirect measurement requiring implantation of a pressure sensor during aneurysm repair. None of these methods is without limitations. Radiation pressure, such as that generated by a modulated ultrasound (US) beam, can induce surface vibration at a distance. The velocity of the resulting surface waves depends on the tensile stress of the vibrated surface. By measuring the change in wave velocity, it is possible to detect the change in tensile stress and calculate the pressure through the vibrated surface. We tested this concept in an in vitro aneurysm model.\nRubber tubes and explanted porcine abdominal aortas were used to model an aneurysm sac. The surface of the model was vibrated with an amplitude-modulated US beam. The resulting motion was detected either by reflected laser light or by Doppler US. The phase of the propagating wave was measured to assess changes in velocity with different pressures.\nIncreasing hydrostatic pressure in the rubber model correlated well with the cumulative phase shift (R(2) = 0.96-0.99; P < .0001). By using a pump to generate dynamic pressure (between 110 and 200 mm Hg), the cumulative phase shift correlated well with the square of the mean pressure (R(2) = 0.92; P < .0001); however, the correlation with pulse pressure was poor (24-36 mm Hg; r = 0.38; P < .02). In the porcine in vitro aortic sac model, the cumulative phase shift detected with both laser (r = 0.94-0.99; P < .0001) and Doppler (r = 0.96-0.99; P < .0001) correlated well with the aneurysm pressure.\nApplication of vibrometry for noninvasive measurement of aortic aneurysm sac tension is feasible in an in vitro setting. The concept of vibrometry may be used to detect endotension noninvasively after EVAR. Vibrometry may also be used to estimate wall stress in native aneurysms, and it may predict the risk of aneurysm rupture.\nVibrometry may offer a technique for completely noninvasive monitoring of aneurysm sac pressure after EVAR. Vibrometry is based on the following principles: radiation pressure, such as that generated by modulated US, can induce surface vibration at a distance; by measuring the change in wave velocity of vibration, it is possible to detect changes in tensile stress and calculate the pressure through the vibrated surface. We tested this concept in an in vitro model and found that application of vibrometry for noninvasive measurement of aortic aneurysm sac tension is feasible. Vibrometry may also be used to estimate wall stress in native aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound mapping of arm veins is being performed with increasing frequency. Unlike ultrasound testing in other areas, this has never been subjected to a gold standard invasive test to determine accuracy. Duplex mapping appears to have a good predictive value whenever large veins are demonstrated preoperatively, but its ability to accurately measure minimum-sized veins is unproven. In this study, we compared diameter measurements obtained under six different conditions and used the maximum diameter as the comparison gold standard.\nA 12-MHz linear probe was used to measure the cephalic and basilic vein cross-sectional diameters at the wrist level in 24 normal volunteers under the following conditions: (1) resting supine with a room temperature of 23 degrees to 24 degrees C, (2) supine with a tourniquet inflated to 65 mm Hg, (3) sitting with the arm dangling, (4) sitting with a tourniquet, (5) sitting after a 2-minute immersion in warm water (44 degrees C), and (6) same with tourniquet. Half the subjects underwent the protocol in a different order.\nVein diameters were significantly larger after submersion in warm water compared with supine (P < .05, pair-wise multiple comparison procedure, Student-Newman-Keuls method). Assuming the sitting position (from supine) resulted in a decreased arm vein diameter 58% of the time. In 25% of the normal subjects, the cephalic vein size was <2 mm, which increased to >2 mm after warming. All subjects had either a cephalic or a basilic vein at the wrist that was >3.1 mm after warming.\nUse of warm water immersion before vein diameter measurement in a sitting position, without a tourniquet, will result in significantly larger diameter findings in normal arm veins. These diameters are likely to more closely resemble the venous diameter after distension with arterial pressure. Further studies are needed to see if warming in patients could result in increased utilization of autogenous arm vein for dialysis access and bypass.",

    "abstract": "The Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI)-inspired push to create autogenous fistulas has led to a resurgence of interest in basilic vein transposition as an autogenous access conduit. We reviewed our experience with autogenous brachial-basilic upper arm transpositions (BTX) to clarify current maturation and patency rates and provide realistic expectations for a tertiary referral vascular practice.\nWe follow an aggressive \"all-autogenous\" policy with regard to dialysis access and recommend BTX when all cephalic options are exhausted. Prosthetic grafts are not attempted unless all upper extremity veins are unusable. The records of all patients undergoing autogenous basilic and brachial vein upper arm transpositions for hemodialysis access between April 2001 and December 2004 were retrospectively evaluated. Mean follow-up was 10 months (range, 0 to 38 months).\nEighty-seven patients underwent 100 basilic and 3 brachial vein transpositions. Most of the patients were already receiving hemodialysis (83%), with a mean of 1.1 (range, 0 to 4) previous access attempts. Perioperative complications included 1 death secondary to a myocardial infarction, 7 hematomas (4 requiring reoperation), and 6 infections (2 requiring reoperation). Steal syndrome developed in five patients. Maturation rate was 79%. Functional primary and secondary patency rates were 23% +/- 5% and 47% +/- 6% at 1 year and 11% +/- 5% and 40% +/- 10% at 2 years, respectively (mean +/- SE). The most common causes of failure for a matured fistula were stenosis within the body of the basilic vein (44%) followed by central venous outflow stenosis (20%). No preoperative variable, including gender, age, diabetes mellitus, presence of ipsilateral hemodialysis catheter, number of previous access attempts, maximal or minimal vein diameter, or obesity, had a significant impact on rate of maturation or long term patency.\nIn our experience, autogenous brachial-basilic upper arm transposition fistulas have initial maturation rates that exceed DOQI guidelines, but disappointing short- to medium-term patency rates. Although these outcomes were obtained within the context of an aggressive all-autogenous policy, the poor durability of these transpositions should prompt further investigation of current access algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Autologous brachiobasilic transposition arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are desirable but require long incisions and extensive surgical dissection. To minimize the extent of surgery, we developed a catheter-based technique that requires only keyhole incisions and local anesthesia.\nThe technique involves exposure and division of the basilic vein at the elbow. A guidewire is introduced into the vein, and a 6F \"push catheter\" is advanced over the guidewire and attached to the vein with sutures. Gently pushing the catheter proximally inverts, or intussuscepts, the vein. Side branches that are felt as resistances when pushing the catheter forward are localized, clipped, and divided under direct vision. Throughout the procedure, the endothelium always remains intraluminal. The basilic vein is externalized at the axilla without dividing it proximally and is tunneled subcutaneously, where it is anastomosed to the brachial artery.\nThirty-two patients underwent the procedure--31 as outpatients. The mean duration of operation was less than 90 minutes. All patients tolerated the procedure well, and 31 required only intravenous sedation and local anesthesia. At a mean follow-up of 8 months, the primary patency rate of AVFs in patients with basilic vein diameters of 4 mm or more on preoperative duplex ultrasonography was 80%, vs 50% for those with vein diameters less than 4 mm. Overall, 78% of patent AVFs were being successfully accessed and 22% were still maturing at last follow-up.\nAutologous brachiobasilic transposition AVFs can be created by using catheter-mediated techniques that facilitate the mobilization and tunneling of the basilic vein through small incisions. Medium-term data suggest that the inversion method results in acceptable maturation and functionality of AVFs created with this technique.",

    "abstract": "Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is a promising treatment of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to prevent the postthrombotic syndrome by early removal of thrombus. During CDT for DVT patients, the calf muscle pump is compromised because of immobility. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) can be used to increase venous flow during bed rest. The CDT with IPC may lyse venous thrombus better than CDT alone. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of IPC during CDT for DVT using low-dose urokinase.\nTwenty-four patients with proximal DVT confirmed by duplex ultrasonography underwent CDT alone (10 cases) and CDT with IPC and a temporary inferior vena cava filter (14 cases) for 3 to 6 days. Pulmonary emboli (PEs) were assessed by pretreatment and posttreatment pulmonary angiogram or spiral computed tomography of the chest, and in the CDT/IPC patients, a posttreatment inferior vena cavogram was performed. The initial results were evaluated by venogram immediately after CDT, and the late results were evaluated by venous disability score and duplex ultrasonography 6 to 36 months after treatment.\nThere was no symptomatic PE in either group. In CDT with IPC, one new asymptomatic PE was found, but there was no large thrombus in the inferior vena cava. The initial thrombolytic results of CDT with IPC were better than those of CDT alone (five cases of complete lysis in the CDT/IPC group and none in the CDT alone group). In the follow-up, the deep veins were patent and competent in 43% (6/14) in the CDT/IPC group, compared with 17% (1/6) in the CDT-alone group. The venous disability score showed that the CDT/IPC group had less disability than the CDT-alone group.\nThis pilot study showed that adding IPC to CDT using low-dose urokinase for DVT treatment of the leg resulted in better early and late outcomes compared with CDT alone and was not associated with an increased risk of symptomatic PEs.",

    "abstract": "Although lower-extremity bypass grafting has been the gold standard for infrainguinal revascularization, endovascular therapies have been increasingly applied to avoid operative morbidities. This study addresses the initial results of an implementation of infrainguinal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) performed by vascular surgeons to treat lower-extremity ischemia.\nFrom January 2002 to July 2003, 95 consecutive patients presenting with the spectrum of lower-extremity ischemic manifestations, in whom infrainguinal PTA was the initial choice of treatment, were assessed for treatment efficacy by clinical and noninvasive evaluation. Study end points of angiographic, hemodynamic, and clinical successes (Society of Vascular Surgery reporting standards) were recorded, and variables associated with ischemic category improvement were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. During the same study interval, 87 patients underwent bypass grafting (not further considered).\nPTA was used to treat 100 limbs in 95 consecutive patients: 63 limbs (63%) had femoropopliteal PTA, 17 limbs (17%) had tibioperoneal PTA, and 20 limbs (20%) had multilevel PTA. Tissue-threatening ischemia was present in 47% of patients, and 53% were treated for claudication. Complications (no mortality) included one myocardial infarction (1%) and two access site hematomas (2%). Angiographic and hemodynamic success (a .10 increase in ankle-brachial index) was obtained in 97% and 90% of the treated limbs, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 14 months, clinical success was obtained in 85% of the treated limbs, and limb salvage for critical ischemia was achieved in 75% (30/40 limbs). Of the PTA failures, five patients (5%) underwent bypass grafting, and five patients (5%) underwent major amputation because of no further reconstructive options or extensive necrosis. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (risk ratio [RR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 8.7, P = .02), poor runoff into the foot (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6 to 8.6, P = .001), and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL) (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8 to 7.6, P = .001) were predictive of PTA failure.\nInfrainguinal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for lower-extremity ischemia is feasible, safe and provides acceptable hemodynamic and clinical results. PTA will become the initial treatment for most patients requiring lower-extremity revascularization.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of wall stress in the abdominal aorta (AA) of humans might be of specific interest, because the AA is the most common site for aneurysm formation in which wall stress seems to be an important pathophysiological factor. We studied the age-related changes in wall stress of the AA in healthy subjects, with the common carotid artery (CCA) as a comparison.\nA total of 111 healthy subjects were examined with B-mode ultrasonography to determine the lumen diameter and intima-media thickness (IMT) in the AA and the CCA.\nAortic IMT was affected by age in men and by both age and lumen diameter in women. Carotid IMT was affected by age and pulse pressure in both men and women. Wall stress was higher in the AA than in the CCA (P < .001), and men had higher wall stress than women in both the AA (P < .001) and the CCA (P < .05). Furthermore, wall stress was constant during life in the CCA of men and women and in the AA of women. In the male aorta, however, wall stress increased with age (P < 0.01).\nArterial diameters increase with age, and a compensatory thickening of the arterial wall prevents the circumferential wall stress from increasing. However, this compensatory response is insufficient in the male AA and results in an increase in stress with age. These findings might explain the propensity for aneurysms to develop in the AA of men.",

    "abstract": "Radionuclide imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) has been proposed for the identification of vascular graft infection; however, its accuracy has not been determined. We performed this prospective study to compare the usefulness of FDG-PET in the assessment of vascular graft infection relative to computed tomography (CT).\nFDG-PET was performed for 33 consecutive patients with a suspected arterial prosthetic graft infection. The PET images were then assessed visually in terms of the density of uptake. In cases with positive uptake, the pattern of accumulation was also defined, such as focal or diffuse uptake. We compared the diagnostic efficiency of PET with contemporaneous CT in detection of infection of the arterial prosthetic graft.\nOn the basis of the surgical, microbiological, and clinical follow-up findings, the aortic grafts were considered infected in 11 patients and not infected in 22 patients. Although the sensitivity of PET (91%) was higher than that of CT (64%), its specificity (64%) was lower than that of CT (86%). When focal uptake was set as the positive criterion in FDG, the specificity and positive predictive value of PET for the diagnosis of aortic graft infection improved significantly to 95% (P < .05 for both).\nAlthough both techniques are useful in evaluation of patients with suspected aortic graft infection, using the characteristic FDG uptake pattern described previously as a diagnostic criterion made the efficacy of FDG superior to that of CT in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected aortic graft infection.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the hospital and follow-up costs of patients who have undergone endovascular (EVAR) or open (OR) elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nThe records of 195 patients (EVAR, n = 55; OR, n = 140) who underwent elective aortic aneurysm repair between 1995 and 2004 were reviewed. Primary costing data were analyzed for 54 EVAR and 135 OR patients. Hospital costs were divided into preoperative, operative, and postoperative costs. Follow-up costs for EVAR patients were recorded, with a median follow-up time of 12 months.\nMean preoperative costs were slightly higher in the EVAR group (AU $961/US $733 vs AU $869/US $663; not significant). Operative costs were significantly higher in the EVAR group (AU $16,124/US $12,297 vs AU $6077/US $4635; P < .001); this was entirely due to the increased cost of the endograft (AU $10,181/US $7,765 for EVAR vs AU $476/US $363 for OR). Postoperative costs were significantly reduced in the EVAR group (AU $4719/US $3599 vs AU $11,491/US $8,764; P < .001). Total hospital costs were significantly greater in the EVAR group (AU $21,804/US $16,631 vs AU $18,437/US $14,063; P < .001). The increase in total hospital costs was due to a significant difference in graft costs, which was not offset by reduced postoperative costs. The average follow-up cost per year after EVAR was AU $1316/US $999. At 1 year of follow-up, EVAR remained significantly more expensive than OR (AU $23,120/US $17,640 vs AU $18,510/US $14,122; P < .001); this cost discrepancy increased with a longer follow-up.\nEVAR results in significantly greater hospital costs compared with OR, despite reduced hospital and intensive care unit stays. The inclusion of follow-up costs further increases the cost disparity between EVAR and OR. Because EVAR requires lifelong surveillance and has a high rate of reintervention, follow-up costs must be included in any cost comparison of EVAR and OR. The economic cost, as well as the efficacy, of new technologies such as EVAR must be addressed before their widespread use is advocated.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to identify differences in the per- and postoperative outcomes between total laparoscopic and open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nWe reviewed 30 patients who underwent total laparoscopic AAA repair between July 2003 and December 2004 (group I). This group was matched in a case-control fashion by AAA morphology and American Society of Anesthesiologists class with a group of 30 patients who underwent conventional AAA repair between April 1997 and May 2004 (group II). Proportions and categoric data were compared with a chi(2) test. Continuous data were compared with a Mann-Whitney test.\nThe two groups had comparable characteristics of age and cardiovascular risk factors. The number of tube and bifurcated grafts was 13 for group I and 17 for group II. Median operative time was 255 minutes (range, 170 to 410 minutes) in group I and 200 minutes (range, 130 to 410) in group II (P <.001). Median aortic clamping time was 80 minutes (range, 35 to 110 minutes) in group I and 50 minutes (range, 24 to 150 minutes) in group II (P < .0001). Total blood loss was 1600 mL (range, 400 to 4000 mL) for group I vd 1000 mL (range, 100 to 2900) for group II (P < .01). The mortality rate was 3.3% for group I (1 patient) vs 6.6% (2 patients) for group II (NS). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of postoperative systemic complications (23.3% vs 30%, NS) and local and vascular complications (10% vs 3.3%). Duration of ileus (2 vs 3 days, P < .05), return to normal diet (4 vs 8 days, P < .0001), day of ambulation (3 vs 4 days, P < .05) and dose of narcotics (3.5 mg vs 28.5 mg, P < .05) were significantly lower in group I. Median length of intensive care unit stay was similar between the two groups (48 hours). Median hospital stay was lower in group I but without significant differences with group II (9 vs 11 days, NS).\nThis case-control study provides preliminary results that short-term outcomes of total laparoscopic AAA repair are comparable with those of open surgery. Peroperative data demonstrate that laparoscopy is more technically demanding than open repair. However, the technical challenge of laparoscopy does not worsen the postoperative course.",

Noninvasive myocardial imaging (n = 325), coronary arteriography (n = 418), or both were performed before surgery in 687 patients (80%), and 100 patients (15%) underwent preliminary coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 78) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (n = 22) before their AAA procedures. Survival was assessed by using logistic regression analysis, proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier estimations.\nThe operative mortality rate was 2.5%, ranging only from 1.8% to 2.8% since 1980. Late survival rates (70% at 5 years, 36% at 10 years, and 16% at 15 years) also remained remarkably similar during five arbitrary intervals comprising the entire study period. On multivariable analysis, overall mortality rates were adversely affected by older age (P < .001), increased creatinine levels (P < .001), straight aortic replacement grafting (P < .001), larger aneurysm diameter (P = .036), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .012). The risk for any early or late death was favorably influenced by preliminary coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.98; P = .035) even when a separate multivariable model was fit to accommodate nine other patients who also had preliminary coronary intervention but developed symptomatic AAAs before elective repair could be performed (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.99; P = .044).\nPatient age and medical risk factors determine survival after open AAA repair to a very similar degree irrespective of the era when the operation is performed.

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are frequently familial. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of AAA among the siblings of AAA patients with that in the spouses' siblings.\nThe siblings of 375 AAA patients and the siblings of the spouses of the AAA patients were included in this study and offered ultrasonography screening for AAA. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to collect demographic and general health information. Statistical analysis was done with Fisher's exact test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated.\nAbdominal ultrasonography examinations were done for 309 individuals. The results indicated that 11 (11.2%) of 98 brothers of AAA patients, 4 (2.7%) of 147 sisters, and none of the 64 siblings of the spouses of the AAA patients were found to have an AAA. Combining the information from the ultrasonography screening and medical records on already known cases of AAA in these families, altogether 29.0% (44/152) of the brothers of AAA patients, 11.1% (20/181) of the sisters of AAA patients, and 2.3% (2/88) of the siblings of the spouses had an AAA.\nThere was a significant difference between the siblings of the AAA patients and those of the spouses both in the frequency of AAA detected by ultrasonography screening and in the overall prevalence of AAA. The overall prevalence of AAA in the siblings of AAA patients was about eight times that observed among the siblings of their spouses (19.2% vs 2.3%). These findings confirmed previous reports on high prevalence of AAA among siblings of AAA patients and emphasized the importance of an ultrasonography screening program for siblings of AAA patients.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative delirium is common in high-risk surgery and is associated with age, education, preoperative cognitive functioning, pre-existing medical conditions, and postoperative complications. We investigated these factors as well as lifestyle and demographic variables by using cognitive measures that were more sensitive than those used in previous studies.\nExtensive medical and demographic data were collected on 102 patients between 41 and 88 years of age to identify comorbidities and lifestyle considerations preoperatively. Elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery was performed under combined general/epidural anesthesia with postoperative epidural analgesia. A battery of sensitive, cognitive measures was administered preoperatively, at the time of discharge from hospital, and 3 months postoperatively. Symptoms of delirium were assessed during the first 6 postoperative days using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th Edition criteria. Intraoperative and postoperative data, including medications, vital signs, conduct of the surgery and anesthesia, complications, and details of pain control, were collected.\nDelirium occurred in 33% of the patients during the first 6 days after surgery. Longer duration of delirium was related to lower education, preoperative depression, and greater preoperative psychoactive medication use. Characteristics of the surgery and hospital stay were unrelated to the development of delirium. Patients who were diagnosed with delirium had lower cognitive scores during each of the three assessment periods, even when controlling for age and education. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the most powerful preoperative predictors of delirium were number of pack years smoked (P = .001), mental status scores (P = .003), and number of psychoactive medications (P = .005).\nA significant proportion of patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair are susceptible to the development of delirium and are at risk for cognitive dysfunction after surgery. Our findings have implications for promoting long-term lifestyle changes, including smoking cessation and improved management of mental health as risk-reduction strategies.",

    "abstract": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have been shown to have an increased incidence of complications after elective major vascular surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate a large series of diabetic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to determine if outcome differed from nondiabetic patients and to examine predisposing factors of poor outcome among diabetic patients.\nA retrospective review of a prospectively compiled database was performed. From 1992 through 2000, 2151 CEAs were performed at our institution. Of these, 507 were in diabetic patients (23.6%), and the remaining 1644 procedures were in nondiabetic patients (76.4%).\nDiabetic patients were significantly more likely than nondiabetic patients to have hypertension (70.8% vs 64.5%, P = .01) and cardiac disease (54.6% vs 49.1%, P = .03). They were more likely than nondiabetic patients to be symptomatic before surgery (52.5% vs 47.1%, P = .04) and to have sustained a preoperative stroke (21.3% vs 17.7%, P = .07). No differences were noted in other recorded demographic factors or in intraoperative factors between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Despite these differences, diabetic patients had similar perioperative outcomes compared with nondiabetic patients, including perioperative myocardial infarction (0.6% vs 0.4%, P = NS), perioperative death (0.8% vs 0.5%, P = NS), and perioperative neurologic events such as transient ischemic attack and stroke (3.2% vs 2.4%, P = NS). Among diabetic patients alone, cigarette smoking, general anesthesia, the use of a shunt, and the lack of clamp tolerance while under regional anesthesia predicted adverse perioperative neurologic outcome, and contralateral occlusion was associated with increased perioperative mortality.\nDespite an increased prevalence of cardiac disease and preoperative neurologic symptoms among diabetic patients undergoing CEA, the rates of perioperative cardiac morbidity, mortality, and stroke were equal to nondiabetic patients. In contrast to nondiabetic patients, current cigarette smoking appeared to predict increased adverse neurologic outcomes among diabetic patients, and the presence of contralateral occlusion among diabetic patients appeared to predispose them towards increased perioperative mortality. The use of a general anesthetic appeared to increased perioperative neurologic risk among diabetic patients; however, this may be related to surgeon bias in the selection of anesthetic technique. Although diabetic patients may have an increase in complications after other major vascular surgical procedures, the presence of diabetes mellitus does not appear to significantly increase risk.",

    "abstract": "Arterial endarterectomy and reconstruction during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can be performed in a variety of ways, including standard endarterectomy with primary closure, standard endarterectomy with patch angioplasty, and eversion endarterectomy. The optimal method of arterial reconstruction remains a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the method of arterial reconstruction during CEA on perioperative outcome.\nA retrospective cohort study of consecutive CEAs performed by 81 surgeons during 1997 and 1998 in six regional hospitals was performed. Detailed clinical data regarding each case and all deaths and nonfatal strokes within 30 days of surgery were ascertained by an independent review of the inpatient chart, outpatient surgeon record, and the hospitals' administrative databases. Two physician investigators--one neurologist and one internist--confirmed each adverse event by independently reviewing patients' medical records.\nA total of 1972 CEAs were performed. The mean age of the patients was 72.3 years, and 57.2% were male. Preoperative neurologic symptoms occurred in 28.7% of cases (n = 566), and the remaining 71.3% were asymptomatic before surgery (n = 1406). The method of arterial reconstruction was chosen by the surgeon. Primary closure was performed in 11.8% (n = 233), patch angioplasty in 69.8% (n = 1377), and eversion endarterectomy in 18.4% (n = 362). There was no significant difference in the preoperative symptom status of patients who underwent primary closure compared with the other methods of reconstruction (72.5% asymptomatic vs 71.1%, p = NS). Primary closure cases were significantly more likely to experience perioperative stroke compared with the other closure techniques (5.6% vs 2.2%, P = .006). Primary closure cases also had a higher incidence of perioperative stroke or death compared with the other closure techniques (6.0% vs 2.5%, P = .006). There were no significant differences with regard to either perioperative stroke, or perioperative stroke/death noted when comparing patch angioplasty with eversion endarterectomy: stroke, 2.2% vs 2.5% (P = NS) and stroke/death, 2.5% vs 2.5% (P = NS) respectively.\nIt appears that primary closure is associated with significantly worse perioperative outcomes compared with endarterectomy with patch angioplasty and eversion endarterectomy, even when the preoperative symptom status of the patient cohorts is equivalent. Although some of its advocates have reported that they can properly select appropriate patients for primary closure based on the size of the artery and other factors, the data demonstrate that these patients have poorer outcomes nonetheless. Primary closure during carotid endarterectomy should predominantly be abandoned in favor of either standard endarterectomy with patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the gold standard for the treatment of carotid disease, with mortality rates generally at 0.4% to 1.7%. Controversy remains with regards to its role in the treatment of the high-risk surgical population. We developed a new clinical scale incorporating weighted risk factors into a single numerical score that correlates with the risk of in-hospital death after CEA. We propose that this tool may serve to prospectively identify the high-risk patient.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of 10 years (1994 to 2003) of the Maryland hospital discharge database. Included in the analysis were patients with (1) International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure code 38.12 (endarterectomy of the vessels of the head and neck other than intracranial vessels) in the primary coding position but not in any secondary position, or (2) Diagnosis Code 433.00 to 433.91 (occlusion/stenosis, precerebral artery), or (3) the Diagnosis-Related Group 5 (extracranial vascular procedure). ICD codes representing preoperative conditions of the patients were identified and evaluated with stepwise regression modeling techniques for association with in-hospital deaths. Different regression models were evaluated and compared by discriminative power as measured by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and goodness-of-fit to data as measured by r(2) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. A numeric index correlating with the risk of in-hospital death was constructed by rounding the correlation coefficients for the statistically significant variables from the logistic regression.\nWe identified 23,237 cases. The mean age of patients was 70.6 years, with 54.7% male patients. There were 125 in-hospital deaths (0.54%). Patient age and four patient medical conditions emerged with significant associations with in-hospital deaths after CEA, and their relationships can be summarized in a single diagnostic scale: 1 point for age > or =75, 2 points for atherosclerosis (ICD code 440), 3 points for cardiomyopathy (ICD code 425), 4 points for iron-deficiency anemia (ICD code 280), and 5 points for cerebral degeneration (ICD code 331). This scale has moderate discriminative power (ROC = 0.67). On average, each point increase on this scale is associated with a 1.58-times increase in mortality risk, with score of 6 on the scale carrying a mortality risk >5%.\nThis new 5-item scale, based on patient age and past medical history, correlates moderately with the rate of in-hospital death after CEA. This clinical index may serve to identify high-risk patients. Future improvements to this diagnostic scale should focus on the diagnostic values of additional laboratory and demographic data.",

Indications included the presence of a large or enlarging pseudoaneurysm, a contraindication to anticoagulation, failure of anticoagulation, and compromised cerebral blood flow.\nFive patients had fibromuscular dysplasia. All patients tolerated the procedure well, with no adverse clinical events. All patients showed symptomatic improvement on clinical follow-up except for one patient, who had hemorrhagic conversion of a pre-existing large ischemic stroke 13 days after intervention; he made an eventual recovery to baseline. All stents have remained patent on radiologic follow-up.\nThis study provides additional evidence that endovascular stent angioplasty is a safe and effective treatment for SCD in patients for whom medical treatment is not adequate.",

    "abstract": "This was a prospective single-center study to assess and analyze cerebral embolization resulting from carotid artery stenting with neuroprotective filter devices in patients considered as poor surgical candidates for surgical carotid endarterectomy.\nFifty-three consecutive patients with an internal carotid artery stenosis were treated by placement of carotid Wallstents with two different types of temporary distal filter protection devices: the Spider filter and the FilterWire. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the brain was obtained 24 hours before the procedure and within 5 to 30 hours after the procedure to detect ischemic brain lesions resulting from the procedure. Inclusion criteria were symptomatic (> or =70%) or asymptomatic (> or =80%) stenoses in surgical high-risk patients.\nTwo (4%) regressive minor strokes occurred. Postprocedural DWI detected new focal ischemic lesions in 21 patients (40%). The average number of lesions was 5.9 per patient, and the mean lesion volume was 1 mL or less in 19 patients (90%). Small differences were found in the lesion distribution: homolateral anterior circulation in eight cases (15.1%), other vascular territories in seven cases (13.2%), and homolateral anterior circulation plus other vascular territories in six cases (11.3%). The microembolization risk seemed nonpredictable on the basis of clinical parameters and internal carotid artery lesion characteristics. An increased risk in the rate of ipsilateral hemispheric embolization has been observed in difficult carotid arch implantations (P = .04).\nThe incidence of new focal ischemic lesions detected by DWI is higher than expected on the basis of previous reports. Embolization from the aortic arch or common carotid arteries could account for most of those events in patients considered as surgical high-risk patients. Although 90% of the events were clinically silent, this high rate of microembolization raises questions about the possible consequences on cerebral cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "Whether surgically correcting symptomatic carotid elongation with coiling or kinking in the absence of an atherosclerotic lesion of the carotid bifurcation (isolated elongation) is effective in preventing stroke remains a controversial issue. The hypothesis behind this study was that surgical correction of symptomatic isolated carotid elongation with coiling or kinking could yield better results, in terms of stroke prevention and freedom from late stroke or carotid occlusion, than medical treatment.\nWe conducted a prospective clinical study randomly assigning symptomatic patients with isolated carotid elongation to undergo either elective surgery or medical treatment, with surgery reserved for any new onset or worsening of symptoms. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 10 years (median, 5.9; mean, 6.2 years) and was obtained for all patients. The study end points were perioperative (30-day) stroke and mortality, late stroke, and stroke-related death and late carotid occlusions.\nNinety-two patients were randomly assigned for surgery and 90 for medical treatment. Overall, 139 carotid surgical corrections were performed in 129 patients. All 92 patients in the surgical arm had an elective operation; 10 of these patients later developed symptoms on the opposite side (7 hemispheric and 3 retinal transient ischemic attacks) and had contralateral internal carotid artery surgery. An additional 37 patients (41.1%) randomly assigned to medical treatment crossed over to the surgical group within a mean of 16.8 months after randomization due to new hemispheric symptoms or worsening nonhemispheric complaints. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths. The incidence of late hemispheric and retinal transient ischemic attacks was significantly lower in the surgical than in the medical group, respectively, 7.6% (7 of 92) vs 21.1% (19 of 90) (P = .01) and 3.2% (3 of 92) vs 12.2% (11 of 90) (P = .03). Late strokes, 2 (2.2%) of which were fatal, occurred only in the medical group (6 of 90, 6.6%; P = .01). Late carotid occlusions also developed only in the medical group (5 of 90, 5.5%; P = .02). All surgically treated carotid elongations were analyzed histologically and 78 (56.%) of 139 showed atypical and typical patterns of fibromuscular dysplasia.\nThe overall results of this trial indicate that surgical correction of symptomatic isolated carotid elongations with coiling or kinking is better for stroke prevention than medical treatment.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events through anti-inflammatory, plaque stabilization, and neuroprotective effects independent of lipid lowering. This study was designed to investigate whether statin use reduces the incidence of perioperative stroke and mortality among patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nAll patients undergoing CEA from 1994 to 2004 at a large academic medical center were retrospectively reviewed. The independent association of statin use and perioperative morbidity was assessed via multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nCEA was performed by 13 surgeons on 1566 patients (987 men and 579 women; mean age, 72 +/- 10 years), including 1440 (92%) isolated and 126 (8%) combined CEA/coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. The indication for CEA was symptomatic disease in 660 (42%) cases. Six hundred fifty-seven (42%) patients received a statin medication for at least 1 week before surgery. Statin use was associated with a reduction in perioperative strokes (1.2% vs 4.5%; P < .01), transient ischemic attacks (1.5% vs 3.6%; P < .01), all-cause mortality (0.3% vs 2.1%; P < .01), and median (interquartile range) length of hospitalization (2 days [2-5 days] vs 3 days [2-7 days]; P < .05). Adjusting for all demographics and comorbidities in multivariate analysis, statin use independently reduced the odds of stroke threefold (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.35 [0.15-0.85]; P < .05) and death fivefold (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.20 [0.04-0.99]; P < .05).\nThese data suggest that perioperative statin use may reduce the incidence of cerebrovascular events and mortality among patients undergoing CEA.",

You were nevertheless unexpectedly detained establishing hemostasis in the main operating suite. You arrived in the SICU as the dressing was being applied. Fistula flows were excellent and there were no operative complications. The resident who began and finally completed the case was highly skilled and in the final month of his vascular training; you had supervised his satisfactory performance of many procedures like this one during the last 2 years. The patient's elderly wife had consented to the procedure, which she was told you would be directly supervising while the resident performed the surgery. When the operation was over you met with her to explain your emergency conflict and assure her that you checked the resident's work and found it entirely satisfactory. She accepted your explanation and was relieved that the operation went well. The patient's multiple comorbidities nevertheless necessitated an extended postoperative stay in the SICU, where you personally cared for him. The resident had dictated routinely that you attended the procedure, and your billing clerk had no reason to doubt the operative report's accuracy when she submitted your surgical fees to Medicare and the patient's private insurer, which paid to their contractual limits without challenge. On many occasions you have had your billings shorted by both. The resident since has graduated. What should you do?",

Although it is unclear in the present case whether eosinophilia was associated with the pseudoaneurysm of the ulnar artery, eosinophil infiltration into the aneurysmal wall may have influenced vascular injury as the cause of the pseudoaneurysm formation.",

We report the cases of three patients who presented with a rupture of the brachial artery after closed posterior dislocation, which is even more uncommon. Arteriograms were performed in all cases because of the persistent absence of pulses at the wrist after emergency reduction. In each patient, the treatment consisted of the insertion of reversed end-to-end saphenous bridges. None of them presented mid-term vascular complications (mean follow-up, 17 months). Brachial artery disruption can result from closed posterior elbow dislocation and responds well to vascular repair.",

A 44-year-old woman presented with acute left neck swelling that progressed rapidly to respiratory distress and subsequent hemothorax. Emergency endotracheal intubation was performed for airway control, and tube thoracostomy was placed for drainage of the pleural space. A review of the literature reveals that this is the second patient known to be successfully treated by arterial embolization of a ruptured aneurysm of the inferior thyroid artery and the fifteenth known case of aneurysm of the inferior thyroid artery. Surgical or endovascular intervention has been successful. Observation has been uniformly fatal. Because life-threatening rupture is possible, the presence of this aneurysm mandates intervention. Endovascular coil embolization is a viable option for treatment of this entity.",

She was successfully treated with an endograft implanted in the superior vena cava, covering the defect. The unique dual drainage of the pulmonary vein allowed percutaneous treatment of a condition that ordinarily requires complex caval and intracardiac reconstruction. Except for several episodes of arrhythmias, she has been doing well, with exercise tolerance improving from New York Heart Association class III at baseline to class I after treatment. Follow-up imaging and clinical findings at 36 months showed no migration of the stents and significant improvement of quality of life.",

Histopatholgic examination of the kidneys of ischemic/reperfusion rats revealed severe renal damage, which was attenuated in both preconditioned and resveratrol-treated animals. Preconditioning and resveratrol administration led to a marked increase in NO levels in kidney. Renoprotective effects of resveratrol were abolished when animals were pretreated with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nonspecific NO synthase inhibitor.\nThese findings demonstrate an important contributory role of NO in the protection afforded by resveratrol in renal ischemic preconditioning.\nIt is now well established that brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion render a variety of tissues tolerant to subsequent ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury. This phenomenon, referred to as ischemic preconditioning, was first demonstrated in the dog myocardium. The potential for clinical application of such a powerful protective phenomenon has generated enormous interest in identifying the underlying intracellular signaling pathways, with the ultimate aim of pharmacologically exploiting these mechanisms to develop therapeutic strategies that can enhance tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion injury in patients. This study explored the possible involvement of nitric oxide in renal ischemic preconditioning.",

    "abstract": "In France, despite a high intake of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat, the cardiovascular death rate is one of the lowest among developed countries. This \"French paradox\" has been postulated to be related to the high red wine intake in France. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of resveratrol, a major polyphenol component of red wine, on vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro.\nSMCs were exposed to 10(-6) to 10(-4) M resveratrol and cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting. Cell cycle analysis was done by treating cells with propidium iodide followed by flow-activated cell sorting. Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling staining.\nWe demonstrate that resveratrol inhibited bovine aortic SMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest concentration of resveratrol resulting in a significant decrease in SMC proliferation compared with control was 10(-5) M. By flow cytometry, we observed a block in the G1-S phase of the SMC cycle. Resveratrol treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent apoptosis of SMCs but had no effects on SMC morphology.\nThe results indicated that vascular SMC proliferation could be inhibited by resveratrol through a block on G1-S phase and by an increase in apoptosis. It supports the conjecture that red wine consumption may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality.\nOur results suggest that resveratrol inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, smooth muscle cell proliferation, which may help to partially explain a beneficial effect of wine drinking. This inhibition is related to an early block in the cell cycle and also to a dose-dependent apoptotic effect. The present study demonstrates that resveratrol not only is an indirect marker of a healthy life style and alimentation but may also be directly responsible for the French paradox.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing thrombus resolution may reduce the long-term complications of venous thrombosis. The aim of this study was to examine whether a sustained release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) would further improve thrombus recanalization.\nInferior caval vein thrombosis was induced in a cohort of 21 male Wistar rats. A plasmid encoding the human VEGF gene (phVEGF) was injected directly into thrombus (30 to 50 microg) and the muscle adjacent to the inferior vena cava (300 to 400 microg). A plasmid containing the gene encoding beta-galactosidase (pCMVbeta) was injected into the same sites of a separate cohort of rats to act as a control. Tissues were harvested after 1 and 2 weeks, and beta-galactosidase activity was measured to estimate transfection efficiency. Muscle and serum VEGF were measured by enzyme-inked immunosorbent assay. Thrombus size, recanalization, and organization were determined by computer-assisted image analysis.\nThe efficiency of control plasmid transfection into muscle was about 1%. No serum hVEGF was detected in phVEGF- or pCMVbeta-treated animals. Significantly raised levels of hVEGF (P < .01) were detected in the muscle injected with phVEGF after 2 weeks compared with control muscle. There was a significant reduction in thrombus size of 23% (P < .05) and 48% (P < .001) in phVEGF-treated animals compared with pCMVbeta-treated controls after 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. Thrombus recanalization was a significantly greater in the phVEGF-treated group after 2 weeks (mean 19% +/- 2% [SEM]) compared with controls (mean 13% +/- 2%, P < .01). There were no differences in the thrombus organization score.\nVEGF gene therapy of venous thrombus resulted in smaller thrombi with greater recanalization. Angiogenic gene therapy may form the basis of a novel treatment that may improve the resolution of venous thrombi.\nDeep vein thrombosis may lead to residual venous obstruction or reflux and result in post-thrombotic complications that are debilitating and have a substantial socioeconomic impact. Enhancing the resolution of venous thrombi may reduce post thrombotic complications.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the effect of intraluminal thrombus on pressure transmission.\nA saccular aneurysm was inserted into an artificial circulation system. Subsequently, the saccular aneurysm was filled with eight different human aortic aneurysm thrombus samples. Starch solution in an empty aneurysm was used as a control. A pressure sensor measured the pressure in the circulation, and a second piezoelectric sensor measured the pressure in the saccular aneurysm at 3, 2, and 1 cm from the endoluminal surface (23 locations). The influence of the elastic characteristics of the aneurysm wall on the extent of pressure reduction was evaluated by experiments performed with aneurysms made of rubber and paraffin.\nThe pressures measured in the empty aneurysm were identical to those measured in circulation (P > .05). The pressure measured in the thrombus was significantly lower than the pressure measured in the circulation (P < .05). The mean pressure ratio between the systolic thrombus pressure and systolic circulation pressure at 1, 2, and 3 cm was 0.90 +/- 0.09, 0.86 +/- 0.10, and 0.81 +/- 0.09, respectively. However, there was a clear correlation between the pressure in the circulation and in the thrombus (Pearson correlation coefficient: mean, r = 0.997; range, 0.975-0.999; P < .01). The change in circulatory pressure was followed by an almost identical change in thrombus pressure (regression coefficient: mean, beta = .997; range, .983-1.000; P < .01). In stiff aneurysms, the pressure reduction is less than in more compliant ones (P < .05).\nIn an in vitro model, pressure in the aneurysmal sac is reduced by fibrinous thrombus.\nEndovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) aims at reducing the pressure in the aneurysmal sac. Therefore, it seems attractive to use pressure monitoring in the aneurysmal sac as a follow-up after EVAR. This study contributes to the development of the rationale of pressure monitoring in the aneurysmal sac as a follow-up method after EVAR. The aneurysmal sac is filled with thrombus. To interpret pressure measurements in the thrombus, we have to learn about the effect of the thrombus on pressure transmission and on the pressure measurements themselves. Our study demonstrates that reduction of pressure occurs as it is transmitted through a human aortic thrombus.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypasses are performed by using an end-to-side anastomosis, and disease can develop at the distal end; this can lead to poor long-term patency rates. Disturbed flow characteristics are hypothesized as being a major factor in promoting disease development. The objective of this study was to propose a new prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass graft configuration specifically engineered to reduce or eliminate certain disease-influencing factors that act on the host artery.\nThe proposed device contains a streamlined bifurcation toward its distal end that results in two end-to-end anastomoses, rather than the single end-to-side anastomosis in the traditional procedure. Comparisons are made between idealized representations of it and the traditional end-to-side anastomosis for specific femoral artery flow rates. Qualitative results in the form of velocity vector plots and wall shear stress contour plots are compared, and quantitative results examine the wall shear stress magnitudes and gradients along the bed and roof of each graft model.\nVelocity vector plots through each junction suggest that the proposed graft configuration promotes streamlined flow and helps to reduce the magnitude of flow recirculation and separation regions associated with the traditional end-to-side anastomosis. At peak velocity, the flow separation region distal to the toe is eliminated, as evidenced by the change in toe wall shear stress from -0.2 Pa in the traditional anastomosis to +0.5 Pa in the proposed device. Normal fully developed flow occurs sooner in the distal host artery, approximately 15 mm downstream from the toe, unlike 20 mm in the conventional case. The proposed design results in reductions of up to 58% in peak wall shear stress and 86% in peak wall shear stress gradient during the decelerative phase of the femoral pulse in the vicinity of the artery bed below the toe.\nIn vitro tests on the proposed device suggest that the streamlined nature of blood flow through the junction does result in less disturbed hemodynamic conditions within the host artery junction. Abnormal wall shear stress magnitudes and gradients are reduced, and normal fully developed flow occurs sooner in the distal host artery. This suggests that the proposed graft may have design attributes that are relevant in the search for increased prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass graft patency rates. A drawback of the proposed device is that significant flow recirculation and separation exist within the prosthesis itself.\nThe search for a viable alternative to traditional end-to-side anastomosis for prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass procedures is ongoing. Prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass procedures have low long-term patency rates, and there is a need for methods that increase the life span of the procedure. Although research is progressing on a variety of different fronts, this study is significant in that it reports on in vitro tests on a potential device that may increase bypass patency. The device is simple, may be manufactured from clinically proven materials, does not require any additional training in its use, and combines attributes of end-to-side anastomoses with those of end-to-end anastomoses. In addition, the design concept behind the device, the natural bifurcation, may be relevant in other aspects of cardiovascular surgery.",

Our aim was to analyze the clinical and hemodynamic correlations of corona to determine its significance and potential usefulness in classification grading and systems such as the CEAP classification.\nA full clinical and duplex ultrasound record of 287 patients was collected by 60 vascular physicians from 10 European countries. They used the same computer software. This was designed to improve the interobserver consistency of computer-assisted procedures for clinical data gathering. Corona was defined as fan-shaped intradermal telangiectases in the medial and sometimes lateral portions of the ankle and foot. This definition was further refined into three severity grades of light, moderate, and severe, according to reference pictures provided by the software. To avoid overpowering the statistical tests, only data from right lower limbs were analyzed.\nIn this series of 287 unselected patients, a corona was detected in 96 right lower limbs (27.7%) and graded as light in 61 (21.1%), moderate in 24 (8.3%), and severe in 11 (3.8%). The presence of a corona and its severity grade were found significantly related to two risk factors of chronic venous disorders (age and personal history of deep vein thrombosis), the presence of so-called venous symptoms, including pain, pruritus, burning sensation, feeling of swelling, cramps, heavy legs; and most individual items of CEAP clinical classes (varicose veins, edema, all skin changes, C5; and open ulcers, C6). Furthermore, among the patients without skin changes (classes C1 to C3), the presence and grade of corona appeared to be significantly associated with the severity of the disease, with increasing CEAP (P < .05), disability (P < .03), and anatomic (P < .01) scores. The presence of a corona and its severity grade were also found significantly related to the CEAP clinical classes themselves (P < .001), the CEAP disability (P < .001) and clinical severity scores (P < .001), and the presence of superficial reflux in the saphenous and nonsaphenous territories (P = .05) and in the perforators (P < .001). The presence of a deep venous reflux was not found to be significant in this series. The relative risk of finding incompetent leg or calf perforators by duplex ultrasound is 4.4 times greater in patients with corona (P < .001). A comparison between the CEAP classification without corona and a modified classification including corona in C3 shows a better reliability coefficient of Cronbach.\nCorona strongly correlates with the clinical severity and hemodynamic disturbances of the disease. The inclusion of corona in the C3 class should probably improve the reliability of the CEAP clinical classes.",

    "results": "In this series of 287 unselected patients, a corona was detected in 96 right lower limbs (27.7%) and graded as light in 61 (21.1%), moderate in 24 (8.3%), and severe in 11 (3.8%). The presence of a corona and its severity grade were found significantly related to two risk factors of chronic venous disorders (age and personal history of deep vein thrombosis), the presence of so-called venous symptoms, including pain, pruritus, burning sensation, feeling of swelling, cramps, heavy legs; and most individual items of CEAP clinical classes (varicose veins, edema, all skin changes, C5; and open ulcers, C6). Furthermore, among the patients without skin changes (classes C1 to C3), the presence and grade of corona appeared to be significantly associated with the severity of the disease, with increasing CEAP (P < .05), disability (P < .03), and anatomic (P < .01) scores. The presence of a corona and its severity grade were also found significantly related to the CEAP clinical classes themselves (P < .001), the CEAP disability (P < .001) and clinical severity scores (P < .001), and the presence of superficial reflux in the saphenous and nonsaphenous territories (P = .05) and in the perforators (P < .001). The presence of a deep venous reflux was not found to be significant in this series. The relative risk of finding incompetent leg or calf perforators by duplex ultrasound is 4.4 times greater in patients with corona (P < .001). A comparison between the CEAP classification without corona and a modified classification including corona in C3 shows a better reliability coefficient of Cronbach.",

    "abstract": "To describe the fate of perforator veins after surgical treatment of varicose veins and factors that influence this.\nThis prospective study of 104 patients assessed perforator veins by using duplex ultrasound scanning in 145 limbs before superficial vein surgery for varicose veins. Veins were marked preoperatively with ultrasound guidance and ligated with an open procedure; those missed were later treated with sclerotherapy. Duplex ultrasound scans and air plethysmography were used to confirm surgical success within 1 month and to monitor recurrence at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years.\nA total of 850 incompetent perforators were treated, but 5.7% were missed and required further ablation. After 3 years, 75.8% of the limbs had developed further incompetent perforators for a total of 380 incompetent perforators. The number of ultrasound-detectable competent perforators had also increased from 356 to 1047 in that time. The incompetent perforators arose by (1) new vessel formation at the site of previous ligation in 152 (40.4%), (2) changes in pre-existing perforator vessels at other sites in 225 (59.2%), and (3) vessels missed at treatment (< 1%). The diameter of the neovascular channels (3.0 +/- 1.0 mm) was greater than the other incompetent perforators (2.7 +/- 1.0 mm; P < .001). The anatomic distribution of the neovascular recurrences was also different, with 63% found in the paratibial region. The number of new incompetent perforators in a limb was associated with the clinical and physiologic severity of venous disease before surgery, but not to body mass index, gender, or age (P < .01).\nThis study shows that incompetent perforator recurrence after surgery is far more common than previously recognized and is primarily due to either neovascularization of previously ligated perforators or the development of incompetence in newly detected perforators in association with persistent venous disease rather than due to poor surgery.",

    "abstract": "There is controversy regarding the effectiveness of elastic vs nonelastic compression in the healing of venous leg ulcers. To gain insight into this controversy, we randomly compared a four-layer elastic bandage with a nonelastic garment (CircAid) in patients with venous leg ulcers.\nTwenty-four extremities of 12 patients with bilateral leg ulcers were randomized to have a four-layer elastic bandage in 1 extremity and a nonelastic compression garment CircAid in the contralateral limb. The CEAP classification in 22 extremities was C(6 S); ES; A(D6,14,15,P18); PR; 1 extremity in 2 patients was C(6 S); E(S); A(D 6,14,15,P18); PRO. There were seven men and five women. Age ranged from 45 to 82 years, with a mean of 61 years. All patients had postthrombotic leg ulcers diagnosed clinically by duplex ultrasonography (n = 8) or by phlebography (n = 4). Every 4 weeks, patients had the ulcer area measured in square centimeters by a computerized scanning method and had the limb girth measured in centimeters at the foot, ankle, and calf. The ankle-brachial index was determined in all cases. Color photographs of the ulcer areas were taken monthly to assess healing progress. All patients were compliant. Results were assessed at 12 weeks. A patient satisfaction sheet was filled out by the patient, who circled one of the following scores: 3, very satisfied; 2, moderately satisfied; and 1, not satisfied. Cox proportional hazards models or paired t tests were used for comparison.\nThe 24 limbs were randomized and divided into 2 groups of 12 each. Group A received CircAid, and group B, a four-layer elastic bandage. Duplex scanning showed a pattern of reflux in 11 limbs of each group. One limb in each group had a pattern of obstruction documented by air plethysmography (n = 2). Phlebography demonstrated the anatomic site in both limbs. The initial ulcer area in group A was 48.98 +/- 14.13 cm2 and was 50.08 +/- 18.30 cm2 in group B (P = .9285). The ulcer healing rate was significantly faster in group A compared with group B (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.96; P = .0173). Ulcers with hemodynamic obstruction had a protracted course when compared with the contralateral limbs with reflux. There was no significant difference in girth reduction between groups A and B (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-18.52; P = .3580). The ankle-brachial index was normal (> or = 1.0) in all patients.\nIn compliant patients, venous leg ulcers randomized to nonelastic compression had a significantly faster healing rate per week than ulcers treated by the conventional four-layer compression system.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to observe the clinical sequelae of varicose veins after great saphenous vein (GSV) ablation and to assess possible predictability of spontaneous varicose vein regression.\nPatients with symptomatic varicose veins secondary to GSV insufficiency treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were enrolled in the study. Up to five of the largest varicose veins in each limb were mapped, sized, and documented before RFA. No varicose vein was treated either at the time of RFA or within 6 months postoperatively. Varicose vein status was recorded at follow-up visits.\nFifty-four limbs in 45 patients were included. A total of 222 varicose veins were documented before RFA (4.1 +/- 1.1 varicose veins per limb) with an average size of 11.4 +/- 3.7 mm. During the follow-up period, complete resolution of visible varicose veins was seen in 13% of limbs after RFA alone, and 63 (28.4%) varicose veins spontaneously resolved. A further 88.7% (141/159) of varicose veins decreased in size an average of 34.6% (4.3 +/- 3.4 mm). Preoperatively, 19.4% of varicose veins were above the knee and 75.7% were below the knee. Complete varicose vein resolution was 41.9% (18/43) above the knee and 25.6% (43/168) below the knee. For the above-knee varicose veins, 88.4% (38/43) were located medially, and all the resolved ones (47.4%, 18/38) were medial varicose veins. Resolution rates of the 168 below-knee varicose veins were 30.6% (33/108) of medial, 23.1% (6/26) of anterior, 20.0% (3/15) of lateral, and 5.3% (1/19) of posterior.\nGreat saphenous vein ablation resulted in subsequent resolution or regression of many lower-limb visible varicose veins. With further study, the predictability of varicose vein regression may perhaps be increased, which can then direct the treatment strategy to further leverage the advantages of minimally invasive endovenous procedures.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this article is to present clinical and patency results of endovascular treatment of nonmalignant, iliocaval venous obstructive disease and to discuss the evolution of technical details.\nFrom November 1995 to June 2004, 44 patients (female-male ratio, 3.9:1; left-right lower limb ratio, 8.6:1; median age, 42 years; range, 21-80 years) had treatment for chronic disabling obstructive venous insufficiency with iliocaval stenosis or occlusion. The clinical class of CEAP was 2 in 11 limbs, 3 in 31, 4 in 4, 5 in 1, and 6 in 1; etiology was primary in 32 patients, secondary in 10, and congenital in 2. Anatomic involvement included superficial veins in 16 patients and perforator veins in 11. Obstruction was associated with superficial reflux in 4 patients, deep reflux in 13, and both in 13. Ten patients had occlusion. All procedures were performed in the operating room with perioperative angiography and angioplasty with or without self-expanding stent implantation. Venous clinical severity and disability scores were obtained before and after treatment. Patency and restenosis were evaluated by duplex Doppler ultrasonography.\nNo perioperative death or pulmonary embolism occurred. The technical success rate was 95.5% (two recanalization failures), and two (4.5%) perioperative stent migrations occurred. One early thrombosis (2.4%) was treated by thrombectomy and creation of an arteriovenous fistula. One late death and one thrombosis occurred. Restenoses were found in five patients and were all treated successfully (four needed iterative stenting). Median follow-up was 27 months (range, 2-103 months). Median venous clinical severity score improved from 8.5 to 2, and median venous disability score improved from 2 to 0. Cumulative primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of the venous segments at 36 months were 73%, 88%, and 90%, respectively, in intention to treat. The survival rate was 100% at 12 months and 97.3% at 60 months.\nEndovascular treatment of benign iliocaval occlusive disease is a safe and efficient minimally invasive technique with good mid-term patency rates. Moreover, it improves cases with obstruction only, as well as cases with associated reflux and obstruction. Primary stenting should always be performed by using self-expanding stents deployed under general anesthesia to avoid lumbar pain. In case of failure, the endovascular procedure does not preclude further surgical reconstruction.",

The presence of comorbid illnesses was determined with medical record review, patient report, medications, laboratory values, and a primary care physician questionnaire. Functional outcomes, measured annually, included the 6-minute walk, usual-paced and fast-paced 4-meter walking speed, and summary performance score. The summary performance score is a composite measure of lower-extremity functioning (score range, 0 to 12; 12 = best).\nAdjusting for known and potential confounders, PAD patients with pulmonary disease had a significantly greater average annual decline in 6-minute walk performance of -34.02 ft/y (95% confidence interval [CI], -60.42 to -7.63; P = .012), rapid-paced 4-meter walk speed of -0.028 m/s/y (95% CI, -0.054 to -0.001; P = .042), and summary performance score of -0.460/y (95% CI, -0.762 to -0.157; P = .003) compared with those without pulmonary disease. PAD patients with spinal stenosis had a greater average annual decline in 6-minute walk performance of -77.4 ft/y (95% CI, -18.9 to -35.8; P < .001) and usual-paced 4-meter walking velocity of -0.045 m/s/y (95% CI, -0.081 to -0.009; P = .014) compared with participants without spinal stenosis.\nAt 3-year follow-up, pulmonary disease and spinal stenosis were each associated with a significant decline in functioning among persons with PAD. In contrast, female sex and black race were not associated with functional decline among persons with PAD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of a 24-week program of upper- and lower-limb aerobic exercise training on walking performance in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to study the mechanisms that could influence symptomatic improvement.\nAfter approval from the North Sheffield Local Research Ethics Committee, 104 patients (median age, 69 years; range, 50 to 85 years) with stable PAD were randomized into an upper- or lower-limb aerobic exercise training group (UL-Ex or LL-Ex), or to a nonexercise training control group. Training was performed twice weekly for 24 weeks at equivalent relative exercise intensities. An incremental arm- and leg-crank test (ACT and LCT) to maximum exercise tolerance was performed before and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks of the intervention to determine peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)). Walking performance, defined as the claudicating distance (CD) and maximum walking distance (MWD) achieved before intolerable claudication pain, was assessed at the same time points by using a shuttle-walk protocol. Peak blood lactate concentration, Borg ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and pain category ratio (CR-10) were recorded during all assessments.\nCD and MWD increased over time (P < .001) in both training groups. At 24 weeks, CD had improved by 51% and 57%, and MWD had improved by 29% and 31% (all P < .001) in the UL-Ex and LL-Ex groups, respectively. An increase in peak heart rate at MWD in the UL-Ex group (109 +/- 4 vs 115 +/- 4 beats/min; P < .01) and LL-Ex group (107 +/- 3 vs 118 +/- 3 beats/min; P = .01) was accompanied by an increase in the amount of pain experienced in both groups (P < .05), suggesting that exercising patients could tolerate a higher level of cardiovascular stress and an increased intensity of claudication pain before test termination after training. Patients assigned to exercise training also showed an increase in LCT peak VO2 at the 24-week time point in relation to baseline (P < .01) and control patients (P < .01), whereas ACT peak VO2 was only improved in the UL-Ex group (P < .05).\nOur results suggest that a combination of physiologic adaptations and improved exercise pain tolerance account for the improvement in walking performance achieved through upper-limb aerobic exercise training in patients with PAD. Furthermore, that both arm- and leg-crank training could be useful exercise training modalities for improving cardiovascular function, walking performance, and exercise pain tolerance in patients with symptomatic PAD.",

    "abstract": "Balloon angioplasties of stenotic or occluded infrapopliteal arteries may be helpful in selected high-risk patients threatened with limb loss. Thus far, these procedures have demanded fluoroscopy and the injection of potentially nephrotoxic contrast material. Herein, we proposed a new alternative to avoid the harmful effects of radiation exposure and the risk of acute renal failure.\nOver the last 16 months, 30 patients (57% male) aged 74 +/- 9 years (mean +/- SD) had a total of 52 attempted balloon angioplasties of the infrapopliteal arteries in 32 limbs under duplex guidance. Indications for the procedure were critical ischemia in 20 limbs (63%), including rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and gangrene in 4 (13%), 10 (31%), and 6 (19%) limbs, respectively. Severe disabling claudication was an indication in the remaining 12 limbs (37%). All patients had concomitantly performed balloon angioplasties of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries (28 cases) or the popliteal artery alone (4 cases). Balloon angioplasty of the infrapopliteal arteries was performed as an adjunct to improve runoff. Hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, smoking, and coronary artery disease were present in 77%, 73%, 50%, 47%, and 37% of cases, respectively. There were 42 cases (81%) with infrapopliteal arterial stenoses (25 tibioperoneal trunks, 9 peroneal arteries, 4 anterior tibial arteries, and 4 posterior tibial arteries) in 26 limbs. The remaining 10 cases (19%) had infrapopliteal arterial occlusions (4 tibioperoneal trunks, 5 peroneal arteries, and 1 anterior tibial artery) in 6 limbs. All these cases were combined with more proximal endovascular procedures (21 femoropopliteal stenoses and 11 femoropopliteal occlusions). All patients had preprocedure duplex arterial mapping and ankle/brachial index (ABI) measurement. Local anesthesia with light sedation was used in all cases. The common femoral artery was cannulated under direct duplex visualization. Still under duplex guidance, a guidewire was directed into the proximal superficial femoral artery and distally, beyond the infrapopliteal diseased segment. The diseased segment was then balloon-dilated. Balloon diameter and length were chosen according to the arterial measurements obtained by duplex guidance. Completion duplex examinations were performed and postprocedure ABIs were obtained in all cases.\nAlthough the overall technical success was 94% (49/52 cases), it was 95% for those with stenoses (40/42 cases) and 90% for those with occlusions (9/10 cases; P < .5). Intraoperative thrombosis occurred in three infrapopliteal cases (two tibioperoneal trunks and one peroneal artery) and in one popliteal artery. All four cases were successfully managed with intra-arterial infusion of thrombolytic agents under duplex guidance. Overall, the preprocedure and postprocedure ABIs ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 (mean +/- SD, 0.58 +/- 0.15) and 0.7 to 1.1 (mean +/- SD, 0.9 +/- 0.16), respectively (P < .0001). Twenty-two (88%) of 25 patients experienced a significant (> 0.15) postoperative ABI increase. Overall 30-day survival and limb salvage rates were 100%.\nThe proposed technique eliminates the need for radiation exposure and the use of contrast material, and it seems to be an effective alternative approach for the treatment of infrapopliteal occlusive disease. Additional advantages include accurate selection of the proper size of balloon and confirmation of the adequacy of the technique by hemodynamic and imaging parameters.",

    "abstract": "The technique of balloon angioplasty of infrainguinal arteries requires standard arteriography and fluoroscopic guidance. We attempted to perform this procedure under duplex guidance to avoid the use of nephrotoxic contrast material and radiation exposure in patients with renal insufficiency.\nOver 16 months, 28 patients (17 men) with serum creatinine levels of 1.5 mg/dL or more underwent 37 lower extremity duplex-guided balloon angioplasties at our institution. Ages ranged from 58 to 92 years (mean +/- SD, 74 +/- 9 years). Disabling claudication was the indication in 24 cases (65%), and critical ischemia, in 13 cases. Preoperative duplex arterial mapping showed severe superficial femoral artery and/or popliteal artery stenoses in all cases. No arterial occlusions were treated in this series. Seven procedures (19%) were performed for restenosis. The ipsilateral common femoral artery was cannulated in 32 cases (86%), and the contralateral common femoral artery, in 5 cases (14%), under direct duplex visualization. Contralateral common iliac artery cannulations were performed with the help of fluoroscopy. By using sonographic visualization, a guidewire was directed into the origin of the superficial femoral artery, across the diseased segment, and into the popliteal artery. The diseased segment was then balloon-dilated. Balloon diameter and length were chosen according to arterial measurements obtained by duplex scan. Plaque dissections and recoils causing stenosis of 30% or more, a peak systolic velocity ratio of 2 or more, or both were stented under duplex guidance. Arterial duplex examinations and ankle/brachial indexes were obtained before hospital discharge, within 1 month after the procedure, and every 3 months thereafter.\nThirty-day survival was 100%. Local complications included one open exploration for expanding hematoma. Technical success was achieved in all cases. Placement of intraluminal stents was deemed appropriate in 23 (62%) of 37 cases. The 1-month patency and limb salvage rates were 100%. Preprocedure and postprocedure ankle/brachial indexes ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 (mean +/- SD, 0.64 +/- 0.16) and 0.64 to 1.2 (mean +/- SD, 0.92 +/- 0.15), respectively (P < .0001).\nDuplex-guided balloon angioplasty seems to be a safe and effective technique that allows renal patients to experience continued limb salvage and relief from claudication without the risk of developing dye-induced acute renal failure. Other advantages include direct visualization of the puncture site, accurate selection of the proper size of balloon and stent, confirmation of the adequacy of the technique by hemodynamic and imaging parameters, and avoidance of radiation. Although this technique holds considerable potential, longer follow-up will help to fully evaluate its broader applicability.",

In the interim, numerous PCAS studies have recently been published, and the aim of this study was to combine the published results and examine the outcomes and safety of PCAS.\nElectronic, manual, and bibliographic searches of PubMed and PreMedline were conducted. Proportion differences were calculated for the periprocedural (30-day) outcomes of any stroke and any stroke or death.\nMore than 400 articles were identified. Only 26 studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 2,992 patients treated with PCAS. Within this patient group, the pooled perioperative PCAS rate of any type of stroke was 2.4% +/- 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]). The 30-day minor stroke rate was 1.1% +/- 0.2% (95% CI), and the 30-day major stroke rate was 0.6% +/- 0.2% (95% CI). The 30-day mortality rate was 0.9% +/- 0.4% (95% CI).\nThis study demonstrates relatively low rates of reported perioperative adverse events in PCAS. Selective use of PCAS to treat carotid artery stenosis in those at highest risk for surgical complications is appropriate until the randomized trials of CEA vs PCAS provide concurrent short- and long-term outcome data.",

Of these, 142 were men (56%). Hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and chronic renal failure were present in 81%, 44%, 43%, 28%, and 19% of the patients, respectively. Neurologically asymptomatic patients accounted for 71% of the cases. All patients received general anesthesia. Duplex-assisted skin markings of the diseased carotid artery were performed after proper patient positioning on the operating table. Synthetic patches were routinely used, and intraluminal shunts were deemed necessary by low stump pressures in 64 cases (24%). Completion duplex scanning was performed in all cases.\nThe length of the longitudinal skin incision varied from 0.8 to 3.5 inches (average 1.4 +/- 0.5 inches). It was < or = 1 inch in 56 cases (21%), 1.1 to 1.5 inches in 110 (42%), 1.6 to 2 inches in 85 (32%), and 2.1 to 3.5 inches in the remaining 14 cases (5%). Intraluminal shunts were required in 9 (16%), 18 (16%), 29 (34%), and 8 (57%) of the cases, respectively. Incisions were longer in cases requiring an indwelling shunt (1.6 +/- 0.6 inches vs 1.4 +/- 0.4 inches) (P < .0001). The average patch length was 1.3 +/- 0.3 inches (range, 0.7 to 2.6 inches). The skin incision averaged 1.54 +/- 0.45 inches for the first 133 cases and 1.35 +/- 0.45 inches for the remaining 132 cases (P < .0001). Technical defects occurred in 10 cases (3.8%). The overall incidence of ipsilateral stroke and death was 1.9% and 0%. There were no technical defects or strokes in patients with the shortest incisions (< or = 1 inch). Overall, there were three transitory peripheral nerve injuries (1.1%). A comparative analysis with 265 consecutive CEAs performed immediately before this series without duplex-assisted skin markings revealed no significant differences in age (71 +/- 11 years), incidence of neurologically symptomatic patients (26%), sex (60% men), shunt use (24%), and major technical defects (3%). Also, postoperative transitory peripheral nerve injury (0.8%), stroke (0%), and death (0%) were not significantly different from the duplex-assisted group. It is of interest to note that none of the former cases was performed with a skin incision < or = 2 inches.\nMost CEAs (95%) can safely be performed with < or = 2-inch skin incisions. Pre-CEA duplex-assisted skin marking is a novel approach that confirms the side of the operation, localizes the disease, and minimizes the magnitude of the operation via shorter, more esthetically pleasing incisions.",

    "abstract": "Patch closure after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) improves clinical outcome compared with primary closure. Whether there are differences in outcome between various patch materials is still not clear. The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate whether a relationship exists between the patch type and the number of microemboli as registered during CEA by transcranial Doppler imaging, the clinical outcome (transient ischemic attack and cerebrovascular accident), and the occurrence of restenosis.\nWe included 319 patients who underwent CEA. Intraoperative microembolus registration was performed in 205 procedures. Microembolization was recorded during four different periods: dissection, shunting, clamp release, and wound closure. The decision to perform primary closure or to use a patch for the closure of the arteriotomy was made by the surgeon, and Dacron patches were used when venous material was insufficient. Cerebral events were recorded within the first month after CEA, and duplex scanning was performed at 3 months (n = 319) and 1 year (n = 166) after CEA. A diameter reduction of more than 70% was defined as restenosis.\nPrimary, venous, and Dacron patch closures were performed in 83 (26.0%), 171 (53.6%), and 65 (20.4%) patients, respectively. Primary closure was significantly related to sex (Dacron patch, 35 men and 30 women; venous patch, 108 men and 63 women; primary closure, 72 men and 11 women; P < .001). The occurrence of microemboli during wound closure was also related to sex (women, 2.5 +/- 0.6; men, 1.0 +/- 0.2; P = .01). Additionally, during clamp release, Dacron patches were associated with significantly more microemboli than venous patches (11.1 +/- 3.4 vs 4.0 +/- 0.9; P < .01), and this difference was also noted during wound closure (3.1 +/- 0.9 vs 1.4 +/- 0.4; P < .05). Transient ischemic attacks and minor strokes after CEA occurred in 5 (2.4%) of 205 and 6 (2.9%) of 205 procedures, respectively, and the degree of microembolization during dissection was related to adverse cerebral events (P = .003). In contrast, the type of closure was not related to immediate clinical adverse events. However, primary closure and Dacron patches were associated with an increase in the restenosis rate compared with venous patches: after 400 days, the restenosis rate for Primary closure was 11%, Dacron patch 16%, and venous patch 7% (P = .05; Kaplan-Meier estimates).\nMicroemboli are more prevalent during clamp releases and wound closure when Dacron patches are used. Additionally, the observed differences in embolization noted by patch type were mainly evident in women. However, the use of Dacron patches was not related to immediate ischemic cerebral events but was associated with a higher restenosis rate compared with venous patch closure. This suggests that venous patch closure may be preferred for CEA.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease is responsible for a variety of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic to cerebral ischemic events. Considering the upcoming use of noninvasive imaging modalities, plaque characteristics could serve as a marker in the selection of patients eligible for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This would be more likely if characteristics corresponded with clinical manifestations and were predictive of future events. In this study, we hypothesized that plaque characteristics correlate with the clinical presentation of carotid artery disease.\nWe included 404 patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Ipsilateral clinical symptoms and duplex measurements were recorded. Patients could be asymptomatic (23.5%) or symptomatic with stroke (26.5%), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (36.1%), or amaurosis fugax (AFX) (13.9%). Plaques were stained and semi-quantitatively analyzed for the presence of macrophages, smooth muscle cells, collagen, calcifications, and thrombus. Plaques were categorized in three phenotypes by their overall presentation and the amount of fat. In addition, plaque matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and cytokines expressions were measured.\nFibrous, fibro-atheromatous, and atheromatous plaques were observed in 30.2%, 35.6%, and 34.2%, respectively. Atheromatous plaques were more prevalent in patients with stroke and TIA compared with asymptomatic patients or patients with AFX (P = .001). Collagen staining was less evident in patients with TIA and stroke compared with asymptomatic patients or patients with AFX (P < .001). Plaques of patients with TIA and stroke showed significantly higher activity levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9 and higher levels of interleukin-8 compared with asymptomatic and AFX patients.\nPlaque phenotype of patients with TIA is comparable to that of patients with stroke; whereas, the plaque phenotype of patients with AFX resembles the plaque phenotype of asymptomatic patients. Follow-up studies should be encouraged to determine whether plaque characteristics visualized by imaging techniques might help to identify patients most likely to benefit from CEA.",

    "abstract": "Vascular lesions involving the thoracic aorta are often life-threatening conditions that carry significant morbidity and mortality with traditional open surgical repair. Preliminary results suggest that endovascular therapy is an effective and possibly advantageous treatment for diseases of the descending thoracic aorta.\nBetween October 2000 and May 2004, 50 consecutive patients underwent endovascular stent-grafting of lesions involving the descending thoracic aorta. Attempted stent-graft deployment was performed electively in 39 patients and emergently in 11. The pathology of electively treated aortic lesions included degenerative/atherosclerotic aneurysms (n = 24), pseudoaneurysms (n = 11), aortic dissections (n = 2), and penetrating ulcers (n = 2). Emergently treated aortic lesions were for acute rupture due to infectious (mycotic) aneurysms (n = 4), atherosclerotic/degenerative aneurysms (n = 3), acute type B dissections (n = 2), and acute transections (n = 2). Devices used include Talent (n = 45), AneuRx aortic cuffs (n = 2), custom-fabricated Gianturco-Dacron grafts (n = 2), and a modified Cook-Zenith abdominal aortic graft (n = 1). Follow-up was performed at 1-month, 6-months, 1-year, and annually thereafter.\nPrimary technical success, defined as successful deployment and exclusion of the lesion without evidence of type I or type III endoleak, was achieved in 48 (96%) of 50 patients. In one patient, the procedure was terminated due to inability to access the iliac vessels. In another patient, a type III endoleak was observed at the completion of the primary procedure that required deployment of an additional stent-graft component 2 months later. Of the 49 patients who received endografts, seven underwent secondary procedures to correct endoleaks, with five of these seven requiring the deployment of additional endovascular stent-graft components. Major complications included four in-hospital deaths, with three of these occurring in patients treated emergently. Additionally, respiratory failure (n = 6), multisystem organ failure (n = 2), cerebrovascular accident (n = 2), retroperitoneal hematoma (n = 2), acute renal insufficiency (n = 1), and pulmonary embolus (n = 1) were also observed. The overall endoleak rate was 20%, with five primary (< or = 30 days) and five secondary (> 30 days) endoleaks observed. Five of the endoleaks were treated with the deployment of one or more additional endovascular stent-graft components. Two of the endoleaks were treated with endovascular balloon remolding. Mean follow-up was 271 days. There were no aneurysm ruptures or aneurysm-related deaths.\nEndovascular treatment of vascular lesions involving the descending thoracic aorta can be safely performed with low morbidity in high-risk patients. Endovascular repair may become an attractive alternative for the treatment of a wide range of pathology along this vascular territory.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to evaluate the use of conventional coils and the Amplatzer Vascular Plug, a type of nitinol-based self-expanding device, to occlude the internal iliac artery in patients undergoing aortoiliac or common iliac aneurysm endograft repair, or both.\nBetween August and December 2004, in preparation for endograft repairs of aortoiliac or common iliac artery aneurysms, or both, at a community hospital system, five patients underwent the occlusion of the internal iliac artery with an Amplatzer Vascular Plug to prevent endoleak. During the preceding 12 months, the conventional coil embolization of the internal iliac artery was used for the same purpose in 10 patients.\nIn five patients undergoing the Amplatzer Vascular Plug occlusion of the internal iliac artery, precise deployment at the origin of the artery was achieved. Complete and precise occlusion was confirmed angiographically, and only one device was used for each internal iliac artery. Two patients reported mild buttock claudication 2 weeks after occlusion, which resolved completely by 6 and 8 weeks, respectively. A type II endoleak from the inferior mesenteric artery developed in one patient. In the previous 10 patients, 11 internal iliac arteries were treated with conventional coils. Subsequent repeat coil embolization was required for three patients. The procedural complications in this second group included one case of coil embolization into the superficial femoral artery and one into the common iliac artery; both errant coils were retrieved successfully by endovascular techniques. An average of 7 +/- 3.4 (mode of 5) coils were used for each internal iliac artery. Three cases of buttock claudication occurred after the unilateral internal iliac artery occlusion in this group and did not resolve. No evidence of ischemic bowel, buttock necrosis, or sexual dysfunction was observed in either group. The estimated average cost to occlude one internal iliac artery was 375 dollars for Amplatzer Vascular Plugs and 3,500 dollars for conventional coils.\nThe Amplatzer Vascular Plug allows for a cost-effective method to occlude the internal iliac artery in patients undergoing endograft repairs of aortoiliac aneurysms. The use of a single device with a precise placement at the origin of the artery minimizes cost and avoids ischemic complications.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported different sac behavior after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, depending on the endografts. This study was designed to evaluate mid-term outcome and sac behavior after treatment with the Gore Excluder stent-graft.\nBetween June 1999 and January 2005, 109 selected patients with suitable anatomy were treated electively for abdominal aortic aneurysm with the Excluder stent graft. Data were prospectively collected in a computerised database and included demographics, details of the aortoiliac anatomy, procedural and clinical success, and postoperative complications. Postoperative sac size and the presence of endoleaks were assessed with computed tomography scans obtained at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. All diameter measures in patients followed for > 1 year (84.4%) were analyzed.\nAssisted primary technical success was achieved in 108 cases (99.1%). No type I endoleaks and 12 (11.1%) type II endoleaks were recorded < or = 1 month from the procedure. Mean follow-up was 29.6 +/- 16.1 months. We recorded one new-onset type IA endoleak, complete resolution of five type II endoleaks, and eight new-onset type II endoleaks. The overall prevalence of type II endoleaks was 14%. Shrinkage at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years was observed in 20.7%, 30.5%, 38.9%, and 36.8% of cases. The presence of type II endoleak influenced the trend of aneurysm size throughout the 4 years. Aneurysms without endoleak shrank more than aneurysms with type II endoleak (P < .0001). We observed two cases of sac enlargement due to the presence of endoleaks. No cases of endotension with sac enlargement, late open conversion, or aneurysm-related deaths were observed. Unchanged aneurysmal sacs remained stable during follow-up, with no adverse events.\nEndovascular treatment with the Excluder device in selected patients produces low rates of shrinkage, but this peculiar sac behavior does not affect mid-term clinical success.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (r-AAAs) has the potential to offer improved outcomes. As our experience with endovascular repair of r-AAA evolved, we recognized that the development of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) led to an increase in morbidity and mortality. We therefore reviewed our experience to identify risk factors associated with the development of ACS.\nFrom January 2002 to December 2004, 30 patients underwent emergent endovascular repair of r-AAA by using commercially available stent grafts. All patients who developed ACS underwent emergent laparotomy. Physiological and clinical parameters were analyzed between patients with and without ACS after endovascular r-AAA repair.\nOver the past 3 years, 30 patients underwent endovascular r-AAA repair, and 6 (20%) patients developed ACS. Patients with ACS had a higher incidence of the need for aortic occlusion balloon (67% vs 12%; P = .01), a markedly longer activated partial thromboplastin time (128 +/- 84 seconds vs 49 +/- 31 seconds; P = .01), a greater need for blood transfusion (8 +/- 2.5 units vs 1.8 +/- 1.7 units; P = .08), and a higher incidence of conversion to aortouni-iliac devices because of ongoing hemodynamic instability and an inability to expeditiously cannulate the contralateral gate (67% vs 8%) when compared with patients without ACS. The mortality was significantly higher in the patients with ACS (67%; 4 of 6) compared with patients without ACS (13%; 3 of 24; P = .01).\nACS is a potential complication of endovascular repair of r-AAA and negatively affects survival. Factors associated with the development of ACS include (1) use of an aortic occlusion balloon, (2) coagulopathy, (3) massive transfusion requirements, and (4) conversion of bifurcated stent grafts into aortouni-iliac devices. We recommend that, after endovascular repair of r-AAA, these patients undergo vigilant monitoring for the development of ACS.",
