    "abstract": "Dipyridamole thallium 201 scintigraphy (DTS) was used to screen 116 consecutive patients referred for aortic reconstructive surgery for coronary artery disease (CAD). Thallium redistribution was found to have the best statistical correlation with postoperative myocardial infarction (MI). No MIs occurred after aortic operations among 60 patients with normal scans compared with 8 of 31 patients with abnormal ones. The odds of a patient with abnormalities found by DTS having a postoperative MI were 12 times greater than for those with a normal scan. No symptom or combination of symptoms of CAD was as good as an abnormal DTS in identifying patients at risk. The incidence of MI was 7.0% for patients with symptomatic CAD and 8.5% for those who were asymptomatic. Cardiac complications gradually declined as surgeons gained confidence in the use of DTS, to the point where no postoperative MIs occurred during the final year of the study. DTS approaches the ideal preoperative test for CAD in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The test does not require exercise, is minimally invasive, safe, and of sufficient sensitivity to detect myocardial ischemia in the absence of symptoms. Furthermore, it is cost-effective; only those patients with an abnormal scan and an imperative need for aortic surgical treatment need further cardiac evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Extensive skeletal muscle necrosis may occur after prolonged ischemia to the lower extremity, with serious consequences both locally and systemically. The extent of necrosis is a combination of cellular damage that occurs during both the period of ischemia and the period of reperfusion. The purpose of this study was to reduce the extent of reperfusion-induced muscle necrosis by therapeutic interventions administered only during the initial period of reperfusion. Indeed, the pretreatment of patients who have an acute arterial occlusion is rarely possible and only interventions applicable to the reperfusion phase would be clinically relevant. By perfusing the isolated gracilis muscle in a controlled manner with reduced oxygen concentrations alone and in combination with free radical scavengers, we were able to reduce the extent of muscle necrosis. By means of controlled oxygen delivery alone, muscle necrosis was reduced from 87% +/- 8% in the control muscle to 67% +/- 9% (p less than 0.05) in the treated muscle. The combination of reduced oxygen delivery and free radical scavengers reduced necrosis from 78% +/- 8% in the control muscle to 53% +/- 7% (p less than 0.01) on the experimental side. We conclude that controlled oxygen delivery and free radical scavengers can reduce skeletal muscle necrosis occurring after prolonged normothermic ischemia.",

    "abstract": "We have studied mechanical factors that could determine how stenosis protects against distal atherosclerosis in cynomolgus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet. Critical aortic stenosis was produced by coarctation of the thoracic aorta. After 3 months, coarcted monkeys had a mean aortic pressure gradient of 25 +/- 1 mm Hg and a 76% +/- 2% lumen stenosis. Aortic wall motion was measured by means of in vivo ultrasonic sonomicrometry. Dynamic tracings of aortic pressure and diameter were recorded simultaneously at standard locations proximal and distal to the stenosis and at comparable sites in noncoarcted control animals. In the proximal aorta, mean blood pressure and pulse pressure were increased (p less than 0.05), but wall motion and intimal lesion area were not different from those determined in control monkeys. In the aorta distal to the coarct, mean blood pressure was no different from that in control animals but pulse pressure was diminished; in addition, there was marked reduction of arterial wall motion (p less than 0.001). This was accompanied by a significant reduction of intimal plaque area (p less than 0.05) and acid lipase activity (p less than 0.001). Thus, inhibition of plaque formation in the distal aorta coincided with reduction of pulse pressure and aortic wall motion rather than with blood pressure or hypercholesterolemia. Inhibition of arterial wall motion may account for the sparing effect often encountered in human arteries distal to stenosing atherosclerotic plaques.",

    "abstract": "From 1977 through 1985, 1043 patients underwent operation for supra-aortic occlusive disease. One hundred thirty-four of these patients (13%) with 146 lesions of the aortic arch branches (innominate, 25; subclavian, 103; and multiple, 10) had one or more symptoms of subclavian steal (78%), transient ischemic attacks (37%), arm ischemia (37%), and others (7%). However, according to results of a critical prospective neurologic examination, the classic steal syndrome appeared in only 13 patients (10%), vertebrobasilar insufficiency in 32 patients (24%), and hemispheric symptoms in 48 patients (36%). Symptomatic and/or significant internal carotid occlusive disease was present, ipsilateral in 28% and contralateral in 31% of the patients. Other supra-aortic vessels were involved in 49% of the patients. During the same period 192 patients with supra-aortic occlusive disease were treated without surgical intervention for various reasons. Fifty-five patients (27%) were completely asymptomatic except for the presence of reversed flow within the vertebral artery. The surgical approach in 138 operations was extrathoracic (ET) in 71% of patients (innominate artery, 2; subclavian artery, 95; and arch syndrome, 1) and transthoracic (TT) in 29% of patients (innominate artery, 23; subclavian artery, 8; and arch syndrome, 9). Generally, bypass procedures were preferred, but for 72 (71%) of the subclavian lesions subclavian-carotid transposition (SCT) was performed. Three patients had been referred for complications of previous carotid-subclavian bypass. The grafts were removed and vertebral and arm circulation restored by SCT. Carotid end-arterectomy was performed simultaneously (20%) or staged (3%) in 8% of the innominate procedures and 25% of the subclavian reconstructive procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent popularity of the in situ saphenous vein graft for infrainguinal arterial reconstruction, considerable doubt exists as to whether this approach offers any real advantage over conventional reversed vein grafts. Therefore we have reviewed our experience with 675 infrainguinal vein grafts undertaken during the past 10 years. There have been no substantial modifications in the technique used for 535 reversed vein grafts over the 10-year period. During the past 3 years, 140 in situ vein grafts have been carried out with the Leather valvulotome used to incise the venous valves. Life-table analysis of 449 femoropopliteal reversed saphenous vein grafts demonstrated 1- and 3-year cumulative patency rates of 81% and 73%, respectively, and a 5-year patency rate of 63%. Seventy-five femoropopliteal in situ bypasses demonstrated a patency rate of 85% at both 1- and 3-year intervals. Cumulative patency rates for 86 femoroinfrapopliteal reversed saphenous vein grafts were 64% and 62% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Comparable patency rates for 65 infrapopliteal in situ saphenous vein grafts remained stable at 87% for 3 years. Fifteen of the in situ bypasses were anastomosed to vessels at the ankle or foot level, whereas none of the reversed bypasses was carried that far distally. This experience with both in situ and reversed techniques on one service by the same surgeons demonstrates a clear superiority of the in situ saphenous vein graft for infrapopliteal reconstruction at the 3-year interval.",

    "abstract": "The Budd-Chiari syndrome is an unusual form of portal hypertension caused by hepatic vein occlusion, which results in centrilobular congestion and necrosis. Its overall mortality rate exceeds 50% at 2 years, and optimal treatment remains controversial. To determine optimal therapy on the basis of clinical and angiographic data, we retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with this disease treated at the University of California, Los Angeles or the University of Southern California School of Medicine between 1955 and 1985. Twelve patients were treated conservatively with diuretics, anticoagulants, paracentesis, and/or peritoneal-venous shunt. Eighteen patients were treated by definitive surgery: side-to-side portocaval shunt (four), mesocaval shunt (four), side-to-side splenorenal shunt (one), liver transplantation (two), transatrial membranotomy (TM) (two), TM followed by inferior vena cava reconstruction (IVCR) (one), TM followed by mesocaval shunt (one) simultaneous IVCR and side-to-side portocaval shunt (one), IVCR (one), and azygousatrial shunt followed 4 years later by a splenopulmonary shunt (one). Overall the surgical group had survival rates superior to the medical group, with a 2-year survival rate of 54% for the surgical group vs. 9% for the medical group (p less than 0.089). On the basis of these data we conclude that surgical therapy is superior to medical therapy for the Budd-Chiari syndrome. However, the operation must be tailored to treat the specific anatomic and clinical abnormality. Guidelines to select the proper surgical procedure are given.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of the retroperitoneal approach (RP) when compared with the transperitoneal (TP) approach in elective aortoiliac reconstruction, 104 consecutive cases were reviewed. From June 1983 through December 1985, 50 patients underwent aortoiliac reconstruction (26 for aortoiliac occlusive disease [AIOD] and 20 for abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA]) through the TP approach and 54 patients underwent operation (30 for AIOD and 24 for AAA) through the RP approach. Both groups had similar revascularization procedures, associated diseases, and preoperative cardiac and pulmonary function parameters. The TP approach was associated with a larger intraoperative blood loss (1950 +/- 196 ml) when compared with the RP approach (1296 +/- 109 ml) (p less than 0.001). The intraoperative crystalloid requirements were also significantly higher for the TP approach (5994 +/- 296 ml) when compared with the RP approach (4455 +/- 295 ml) (p less than 0.0005). Similarly, the intraoperative blood requirements were higher for the TP approach (1235 +/- 115 ml) than the RP approach (853 +/- 61 ml) (p less than 0.001). Both groups had similar operative times. Nasogastric intubation and initiation of oral feeding was significantly prolonged in the TP group when compared with the RP group (p less than 0.001). Postoperative hospitalization was also considerably prolonged in the TP group when compared with the RP group (p less than 0.02). This experience demonstrates that the RP approach is a preferable alternative to the TP route in elective aortoiliac reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "From January 1975 to December 1985, 1454 patients had an intra-aortic balloon inserted for cardiac assistance. Eighty balloon-dependent patients had severe limb ischemia and required a femorofemoral graft (FFG) (5% of the total group of patients). Twenty-nine of the 80 patients with grafts (or 36%) left the hospital and 28 were followed up for an average of 40 months to determine late complications associated with the crossover grafts. All grafts remained patent. The 28 patients were classified into five groups according to the degree and type of lower limb ischemia. Group I consisted of 13 asymptomatic patients (46%); group II had four (14%) patients with mild claudication caused by preexisting peripheral arteriosclerosis; group III comprised four patients (14%) without preexisting disease but claudication subsequent to the FFG; group IV had five patients with irreversible ischemic sequelae before grafting ending in amputation, foot drop, or persistent paresthesia; and group V consisted of two patients with graft infection (7%). The perioperative mortality rate of the balloon-dependent patients with an FFG (64%) reflects the gravity of the cardiac condition. Placement of an FFG to relieve limb ischemia in these patients is followed by few immediate or late complications in the survivors and any persistent limb changes were related to the prolonged ischemia present before revascularization. Our data suggest that in balloon-dependent patients with limb-threatening ischemia, aggressive use of the FFG is limb-saving, durable, and allows continuation of balloon support.",

    "abstract": "The present study reviews the fate of patients undergoing reoperation after failure of infrainguinal bypass grafts. During a 10-year period, 202 patients with failed distal bypass grafts had 389 infrainguinal reoperative procedures, an average of 1.9 reoperations per patient. Including the initial procedure and subsequent reoperations, a total of 591 operations were performed in this group. Secondary bypass was performed in 101 patients, a tertiary procedure in 51, a fourth bypass in 30, and more than four operations were required in 20 patients. Reoperation was performed to treat severe ischemia (rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene) in 377 of 389 cases (97%). Repetitive bypass was performed with autogenous vein in 21 cases (7.4%), composite grafts in 16 patients (5.6%), and polytetrafluoroethylene in 247 cases (87%). The remaining 105 reoperations were thrombectomy in 77 cases, thrombectomy plus distal angioplasty in 20 cases, and profundaplasty in eight cases. The distal anastomosis was to the popliteal artery in 14% of reoperative cases and to the tibial or peroneal artery in 59%. Mean follow-up for all patients was 70 months. Four operative deaths occurred in 389 reoperations (1.0%), and there were 35 late deaths. The cumulative life-table 5-year survival rate for all patients was 80%. The operative morbidity rate was 12.3%, including wound infection in 3.1% and hematoma in 6.4%. Sixty-seven cases required major amputation, below-knee in 48 (72%) and above-knee in 19 (28%). The 5-year limb salvage rate was 59%. Cumulative graft patency was 37% at 5 years. The 80% 5-year survival rate may reflect aggressive management of associated carotid and coronary artery disease. The demonstrated long survival indicates that recurrent ischemia after distal bypass failure requires attention. In this study, re-operation provided long-term limb salvage in most cases without significant compromise in patient safety or amputation level if amputation was required.",

    "abstract": "The present study reviewed arterial culture data from 172 patients undergoing major vascular reconstructions between July 1, 1977, and Dec. 31, 1984. Prosthetic graft infection was documented in 0 of 97 cases (0%) with negative arterial cultures but in six of 75 cases (8%) with positive arterial cultures (chi 2 = 5.84; 0.01 less than p less than 0.025). The data were reanalyzed after the patients were subdivided into two groups on the basis of the numbers of operations: group I (132 patients)--a culture obtained at initial vascular reconstruction--and group II (40 patients)--a culture obtained at a subsequent vascular reconstruction. Positive arterial cultures had no predictive value for graft infection among patients in group I (1 of 57 cases vs. 0 of 75 cases; chi 2 = 0.019), whereas the presence of positive arterial cultures was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of graft infection in group II patients (5 of 18 cases vs. 0 of 22 cases; chi 2 = 4.68; 0.025 less than p less than 0.05). For group I patients, we believe that neither routine arterial culture nor long-term antibiotic therapy for patients with positive arterial cultures is indicated. For group II patients we recommend that routine arterial cultures should be obtained; perioperative antibiotics should be continued until definitive arterial culture information is available; and positive arterial cultures should be treated with a short course of high-dose intravenous antibiotics. Thereafter, long-term treatment of positive arterial cultures with oral antibiotics, although not statistically validated, is probably appropriate.",

Venous volume (VV), venous filling time, and venous filling index on standing from the recumbent position, ejected volume (EV) and ejection fraction (EF = EV x 100/VV) with one tiptoe movement, and residual volume (RV) and residual volume fraction (RVF = RV x 100/VV) after 10 tiptoe movements were measured in normal limbs, limbs with superficial venous incompetence, and limbs with deep venous disease. The same measurements were repeated with a graduated medium compression stocking in limbs with SVI and graduated high compression stockings in limbs with DVD. Ambulatory venous pressure was measured at the same time, with a needle in a vein in the foot. The results indicate that this method of air-plethysmography is not only of diagnostic value but offers a new and unique technique to assess and study the hemodynamic effects of different forms of elastic compression. The lower ambulatory venous pressure, produced by the elastic compression, was the result of a reduction in reflux and an improvement in the calf muscle ejecting ability during rhythmic exercise.",

    "abstract": "To refine our ability to assess intraoperatively renal and visceral reconstructions, we have investigated the usefulness of combined duplex scanning and Doppler spectral analysis to determine the technical adequacy and flow characteristics of these repairs. We studied 62 patients (116 arteries) who underwent renal (83 arteries) or visceral (13) reconstruction by transaortic endarterectomy (76), autogenous graft (12) or prosthetic (5) bypass, reimplantation (2), and dilation (1). Twenty-six nonreconstructed vessels were also studied, including preoperative arteries (6), unrepaired arteries (14), and normal renal arteries (donor nephrectomies) (6). Duplex scanning was performed by means of a 7.5 or 10 MHz probe placed in a sterile glove and plastic sleeve. Peak (Vs) and mean (Vm) velocities measured in meters per second were subsequently calculated from frequency spectral analysis. Spectral broadening (SB) and aortic inflow data were also collected and analyzed. There were no complications related to ultrasound scanning. Mean scan time was 7.8 minutes. Fourteen of 26 nonreconstructed vessels (54%) appeared normal by duplex scanning, including all six control (normal) renal arteries. Sixty-five reconstructed arteries (68%) appeared normal, 27 had various minor defects, and four had major defects (three occlusions and one floating thrombus). The major defects were repaired, whereas minor ones were not. Confirmatory studies were obtained in 19 (73%) nonoperated and 73 (76%) operated vessels. There were two false negative duplex studies (sensitivity 89%) and 17 false positive duplex studies--all minor defects (specificity 77%). The predictive value of duplex scans in detecting the presence of confirmed defects was Tau = 0.47 (p = 0.01). Although SB correlated with B-mode imaging alone (Tau = 0.21, p = 0.07), it added no independent value in predicting the results of a confirmatory study. No other variable (Vs, Vm, or aortic inflow) added to the duplex scan in predicting an abnormal confirmatory study. Detailed renal and visceral artery spectral analysis data are provided for validation of this technique and comparison with transcutaneous studies. These data suggest that the requirement for reliable and immediate assessment of renal and visceral reconstructions, particularly those involving transaortic extraction endarterectomy, is satisfied by duplex scanning.",

    "abstract": "Vein grafts become thicker as they adapt to arterial circulation, and in large measure this is the consequence of cellular hyperplasia. The kinetics of smooth muscle cell (SMC) and endothelial cell (EC) replication were evaluated in rabbit jugular vein segments transplanted into the carotid arterial circulation to define the role of cell proliferation in this process, and these data were correlated with dimensional changes in grafts from 1 hour to 24 weeks after implantation. At 1 hour most of the perianastomotic endothelium was denuded, as were occasional cells in the graft away from the anastomosis. EC replication (thymidine labeling index) in the center of the graft increased 400 times during the first week and produced an intact endothelial surface by 2 weeks. The EC thymidine index then fell progressively to quiescent pretransplant levels by the twelfth week. SMC replication was maximal at 1 week after grafting and returned to near quiescent levels at 12 and 24 weeks. Graft wall thickness and cross-sectional area reached a maximum at 12 weeks and then remained constant. Deoxyribonucleic acid content exhibited a thirty-five-fold increase in the first 4 weeks, then did not change. Likewise, SMC mass did not increase after 4 weeks. Further increase in cross-sectional wall area between 4 and 12 weeks was accounted for by accumulation of connective tissue. The final ratio of luminal radius to wall thickness decreased to a level equal to that of normal artery. Since blood pressure did not change over the period of the study, this observation supports a possible regulatory role for wall tangential stress in the modification of vein graft structure after transplantation into the arterial circulation.",

    "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia of the arterial wall may occur after carotid endarterectomy. This proliferative lesion is a pathologic response of the injured arterial wall and may lead to progressive stenosis. We investigated the effect of endothelial cell seeding (ECS) or antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (ASA) on inhibition of this lesion in a canine model. Endarterectomies were performed in 160 carotid arteries; 46 endarterectomies were treated perioperatively with aspirin (325 mg per day), 34 were seeded with a high density (3 X 10(6)) of autogenous endothelial cells, and 80 were untreated control arteries. At selected time intervals, the patent arteries were perfusion-fixed and the cross-sectional area (measured in square millimeters) of neointimal hyperplasia was measured by means of digital planimetry. At 6 weeks, patency of the endarterectomized carotid artery was 88% in the ASA and ECS groups, in contrast to 35% in the control group (p less than 0.01). The cross-sectional area of neointimal hyperplasia was not significantly different in the ASA and the control groups at 6 weeks. However, the ECS group showed a marked reduction in neointimal hyperplasia at 6 weeks (p less than 0.01). This inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia after carotid endarterectomy by ECS may reflect accelerated luminal healing or a direct inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation in the injured arterial wall.",

    "abstract": "An animal model suitable for study of the origin and method of prevention of thromboembolic complications of arterial prostheses has been developed in the rabbit. In phase I of the experiments 42 New Zealand white rabbits underwent insertion of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) aortic grafts, 10 mm in length and of 2 mm internal diameter (I.D.) (n = 17) and 3 mm I.D. (n = 25). The patency rate at 3 months was 24% and 82%, respectively. Unexpected ischemic hind limb ulcers occurred in nine (38%) of the long-term survivors. Arteriograms in these animals showed a typical embolic occlusion of a distal artery, suggesting that the ulcers were due to embolization of loose mural thrombus, which was present in 50% of the grafts when removed. In phase II experiments 54 rabbits were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (ASA) 10 mg/kg/day and dipyridamole (DPM) 10 mg/kg/day (n = 25) or placebo (n = 29). Both regimens began 3 days before insertion of PTFE aortic grafts (10 mm long and 3 mm I.D.). Serum thromboxane B2 concentrations in the control group averaged 300.4 +/- 147.4 ng/ml and 43.2 +/- 58.6 ng/ml in the ASA/DPM group (p less than 0.0005). With the use of autologous indium 111 oxine-labeled platelets, a graft platelet accumulation index (GPAI) was calculated as the graft: reference ratio of emissions. ASA/DPM significantly reduced the mean GPAI calculated from grafts and reference aorta removed 48 hours after graft insertion from 69.3 +/- 4.0 on placebo (n = 4) to 34.3 +/- 2.9 (n = 4) (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The present study examines the hypothesis that alterations in the activity of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors (A2R) may underlie the clinical vasospasm seen in patients with Raynaud's syndrome. Platelets were isolated from 13 normal subjects, from 50 patients with vasospastic Raynaud's syndrome, and from 20 patients with obstructive Raynaud's syndrome and A2R levels measured. Binding capacity as determined in femtomoles per milligram of protein (fmol/mg of protein) and affinity were measured by Scatchard plot analysis. In a separate experiment normal human platelets were incubated with either buffer, normal serum, or serum from patients with spastic Raynaud's syndrome and A2R levels were measured. A2R levels in normal subjects averaged 112 +/- 18 fmol/mg; in the patients with spastic Raynaud's syndrome, 191 +/- 14 fmol/mg, p less than 0.01; and in the patients with obstructive Raynaud's syndrome, 164 +/- 31 fmol/mg, p greater than 0.05 (ns). Of the patients with spastic Raynaud's syndrome, 26% had values that were less than the mean value of the normal subjects (69 +/- 7 fmol/mg, p less than 0.05). The A2R levels decreased after incubation with serum from patients who had spastic Raynaud's syndrome by 17.4 +/- 3.1 fmol/mg (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that most patients with vasospastic Raynaud's syndrome have increased platelet A2R levels, which may constitute a primary pathophysiologic abnormality underlying this condition. The presence of subnormal A2R levels in a portion of the patients and the finding of a decrease in measurable A2R levels after incubation in serum from patients with spastic Raynaud's syndrome suggests the possibility of receptor modulation as a mechanism for increased cellular receptor synthesis.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the safety and efficacy of percutaneous laser thermal angioplasty as an adjunct to balloon angioplasty were investigated in 13 patients with severe peripheral vascular disease. By means of a novel fiberoptic laser delivery system (Laserprobe) in which argon laser energy is converted to heat in a metallic tip at the end of the fiberoptic fiber, improvement in the angiographic luminal diameter was noted in 14 of 15 femoropopliteal vessels (93%) by delivering 8 to 13 watts of continuous argon laser energy as the Laserprobe was advanced through the lesion. Initial clinical success (indicated by relief of symptoms and increase in Doppler index) for the combined laser and balloon angioplasty procedures was obtained in 12 of 15 vessels (80%), with inadequate balloon dilatation being the limiting factor in three patients. No significant complications of vessel perforation, dissection, pain, spasm, or embolization of debris occurred. Of the 12 patients who had procedures with initial angiographic and clinical success, 10 (83%) were asymptomatic in the initial follow-up period of 1 to 9 months (mean 6 months). Thus, laser thermal angioplasty with a Laserprobe is a safe and effective adjunct to peripheral balloon angioplasty. This technique has the potential to increase the initial success rate of angioplasty for lesions that are difficult or impossible to treat by conventional means. By removing most of the obstructing lesion, this technique may also reduce recurrent stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Low molecular weight dextran (LMD) has recently been shown in a randomized, multicenter trial to improve early patency in difficult lower extremity vascular bypass. The question remained as to whether this effect was due to plasma volume expansion by LMD or to its effects on platelets and coagulation. To analyze this we have studied the effects of LMD on platelet-graft interactions using an ex vivo baboon shunt. Indium 111-labeled autologous platelet deposition on expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and knitted Dacron grafts was monitored at a flow rate of 25 ml/min for 21/2 hours. LMD was given by intravenous bolus at a dose of 5 ml/kg and was followed by a continuous infusion of 10 ml/hr. Flow through the shunt was started after the initial dextran bolus. Control studies were performed in a similar manner without dextran. An additional series of experiments was performed with a 5 to 10 ml/kg bolus of 5% human serum albumin to analyze the contribution of plasma volume expansion to platelet deposition in this model. The results revealed a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in platelet deposition on both graft materials with the LMD infusion. No difference was seen between the control group and the albumin group. These studies provide direct in vivo evidence of the antiplatelet effect of LMD.",

    "abstract": "Heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) is a syndrome associated with thrombocytopenia, intravascular thrombosis, and arterial emboli. We have evaluated 16 patients for presumed HIPA because of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia or a new thrombotic complication during heparin therapy. In this group, 16 thrombotic events occurred in 10 patients with a mortality rate of 18.8%. Diagnosis was confirmed in vitro by the demonstration of at least 20% platelet aggregation and/or 6% 14C-serotonin release after heparin (0.1 to 3 U/ml) was added to a mixture of patient platelet-poor plasma (PPP, two parts) and aspirin-free donor platelet-rich plasma (PRP, three parts). After heparin was discontinued, seven patients continued to have HIPA in their own PRP although it could no longer be observed in donor PRP. Iloprost, a potent prostacyclin analog that reversibly inhibits platelet activation, completely prevented HIPA and release in all of nine patients. Aspirin, an irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor, failed to prevent HIPA in four of these nine patients. In conclusion, HIPA is associated with an extremely high morbidity and mortality rate. Evaluation of the patients' PRP in response to heparin may improve the diagnostic sensitivity of this assay. Aspirin does not reliably prevent HIPA, which suggests participation of thromboxane-independent pathways. Thus, if further exposure to heparin is unavoidable, a more effective platelet inhibitor such as iloprost is required to reliably prevent in vivo HIPA.",

    "abstract": "The endothelial injury induced by the placement of a synthetic graft has been implicated as a stimulus for the development of MIH. In this study we compared the degree of EC coverage and the early SMC-PR in the arterial segments proximal and distal to 2 mm diameter PTFE grafts that had been placed in rabbit carotid arteries (n = 49). In vivo labeling with 3H-thymidine and Evans blue was carried out at intervals of 2 to 33 days after grafting. The SMC-PR was measured as the degree of 3H-labeled DNA divided by the total DNA for each segment, and the EC coverage was determined by planimetry of the area of Evans blue exclusion. There was an early rise in the SMC-PR in both arterial segments, but it was more marked in the distal segment (p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between the SMC-PR and the degree of EC coverage in either the proximal (r = 0.25) or the distal segments (r = 0.10). The data suggest that there is a greater SMC-PR at the distal end of an implanted PTFE graft. The degree of endothelial loss and its regrowth does not appear to be an important factor.",

    "abstract": "To characterize any digitalis-induced differences in intestinal blood flow autoregulation, we studied the circulatory responses of the rat intestine in control (n = 7) and chronically digitalized (n = 7) animals. Data were generated from denervated isoperfused small intestinal preparations. Arterial pressure, venous pressure, and oxygen consumption were continuously monitored. Determinations of intestinal blood flow allowed calculation of mesenteric vascular resistance and oxygen consumption. Animals underwent stepwise reductions in arterial pressure and acute venous hypertension (10 to 15 mm Hg). There were no differences in baseline hemodynamic or metabolic parameters in control (C) or digitalized (D) animals. Blood flow and oxygen consumption were autoregulated in both C and D rats until perfusion pressure decreased below 50 mm Hg. The response to acute venous hypertension was different. In D rats, venous hypertension resulted in increased vascular resistance (millimeters of mercury per milliliter per minute per 100 gm) [0.89 +/- 0.05 to 0.97 +/- 0.07; p less than 0.05], whereas C rats demonstrated no change [0.92 +/- 0.08 to 0.95 +/- 0.09]. The decrease in oxygen consumption in D rats (-14%) was slightly but significantly greater than that observed in C rats (-9%). Digitalized rats demonstrated a heightened myogenic response to acute venous hypertension with deleterious effects on vascular resistance and oxygen consumption. This reaction was intrinsic to the mesenteric circulation and not mediated by sympathetic nerves or central reflexes. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia in digitalized patients may reflect a similar abnormal response to the acute increases in portal pressure accompanying cardiac failure.",

    "abstract": "To determine optimal methods of reoperation, experience with 157 secondary procedures for unilateral aortofemoral graft limb occlusion in 110 patients during a 16-year period was reviewed. In earlier years, inflow was reestablished by direct replacement of the graft limb or entire graft (11%); more recently, graft limb thrombectomy has been used most frequently (68%) with equal success, durability, and less morbidity. Femorofemoral grafts from the patent contralateral graft limb were employed in 18% of patients, usually those in whom thrombectomy was not attempted. Thrombolytic therapy (3%) appears to offer little advantage, is time-consuming, and occasionally causes significant complications. In addition to reestablishment of inflow, most patients also required revision of the femoral anastomosis to improve profunda femoris runoff; this was usually best accomplished by short segmental extension of the graft limb to the more distal deep femoral artery. Concomitant femoropopliteal bypass was done in 32% of patients and is indicated when preoperative angiography or specific intraoperative findings suggest inadequate profunda femoris outflow. An aggressive approach to reoperation appeared justified by long-term results (mean follow-up 37 months). Despite the need for repetitive reoperation in 26% of patients (two to five reoperations), graft limb patency was ultimately maintained in 78% and limb salvage achieved in 67% of patients, with an operative mortality rate of only 1.9%.",

Resting supine tcPO2 levels of 20 mm Hg or less at the foot were noted in all patients in this study (normal values 60.10 +/- 6.82 mm Hg). Group I patients were defined by an increase of less than 15 mm Hg on standing, whereas group II patients showed an increase of 15 mm Hg or more. Group I patients had a supine tcPO2 value of 4.24 +/- 5.31 mm Hg, with an increase of 3.91 +/- 4.59 mm Hg on standing. The group II subjects also had a low supine tcPO2 level, 5.73 +/- 4.98 mm Hg, but the increase on standing, 36.14 +/- 11.41 mm Hg, was significantly higher (p less than 0.001). When these levels increased by less than 15 mm Hg on standing in group I (31 patients), only 29% of limbs (10 of 34) were saved or had patent grafts at 3 months and 55% of attempted vascular reconstructions (11 of 20) failed. Amputations were performed in 50% of the limbs (17 of 34). This contrasted in group II (69 patients) with a significantly higher limb salvage and graft patency rate (81%, 57 of 70 limbs), success of reconstruction (79%, 37 of 47 procedures), and a significantly lower rate of amputation (11%, 8 of 70 limbs) (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Acute renal artery occlusion is an infrequently encountered entity, with a paucity of literature on which to form clinical decisions. During a 20-year period 35 patients were treated for acute renal artery occlusion as a result of embolism (13 patients), thrombosis of a stenosed vessel (16 patients), or trauma (six patients). Patients were treated operatively in 16 cases and nonoperatively in 19 cases. In patients with embolic occlusion, embolectomy was successful in the relief of hypertension but was ineffective in the restoration of renal function. In patients with thrombotic occlusion, thrombectomy and aortorenal bypass were successful in both the reduction of blood pressure and the retrieval of renal function. In this group, salvage was dependent on the presence of a reconstituted distal renal artery, irrespective of the operative delay. In patients with traumatic renal artery occlusion, return of renal function did not occur, despite reperfusion as early as 6 hours after injury. These data suggest that the period in which function of embolized or traumatized kidneys may be preserved has usually passed by the time the diagnosis of renal artery occlusion has been made. By contrast, operative therapy of thrombotic occlusion frequently results in return of renal function, irrespective of the delay in treatment.",

    "abstract": "Changes in endothelial permeability and the transport of macromolecules may be important in the initiation and/or progression of atherosclerosis. We have previously shown, with a carotid artery preparation isolated in situ with intact adventitia, that long-term cholesterol feeding in rabbits will result in a seven- to tenfold increase in 125I albumin transport across the artery into the systemic circulation. The current studies were undertaken to determine whether this abnormality of enhanced permeability could be reversed by cessation of cholesterol feeding and correction of the hyperlipidemia. Two groups of rabbits were fed either a standard Rabbit Chow or a diet containing 1.5% cholesterol and 5.2% corn oil for 12 to 15 weeks. Another group of rabbits was given cholesterol for 12 to 15 weeks with change to standard rabbit chow for an additional 22 to 24 weeks after which albumin transport studies were then performed. Mean plasma cholesterol level after 12 to 15 weeks of cholesterol feeding was 2052 +/- 395 mg/dl. After the animals were withdrawn from the cholesterol diet for 22 to 24 weeks, the mean plasma cholesterol level decreased to 80 +/- 21 mg/dl. The mean plasma cholesterol value in chow-fed animals was 39 +/- 6 mg/dl. Perfusion studies were done with 125I-labeled albumin and plasma radioactivity served as a measure of transport across the carotid artery. The average level of albumin transport across the artery into venous blood in the cholesterol-fed animals (13,911 dpm/ml of plasma) was significantly greater than that of control animals (2049 dpm/ml of plasma).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Because infrainguinal bypasses performed on the basis of normal papaverine testing in patients with multilevel arterial occlusive disease are done below arteriographically diseased although hemodynamically normal vessels, there is concern about progression of suprainguinal disease compromising long-term success. This study has been done to assess the long-term results of such bypasses. Between 1979 and 1985, infrainguinal bypasses selected by papaverine testing were done on 92 limbs having hemodynamically normal inflow in the presence of arteriographically demonstrable aortoiliac stenoses of 15% to 70%. Long-term hemodynamic and clinical success rates were determined with criteria based on papaverine and noninvasive vascular testing. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic success at 48 months (by life-table analysis) (p = 0.98) when comparing limbs with less than 50% aortoiliac stenoses to limbs having 50% or greater stenoses. The difference between the mean degree of preoperative inflow stenoses for long-term hemodynamic successes (32.5% +/- 1.5%) and failures (34.6% +/- 3.0%) was not significant (p = 0.57). There was no significant difference (p = 0.98) in the number of subsequent inflow procedures required in limbs with preoperative aortoiliac stenoses of less than 50% (13.5%) vs. aortoiliac stenoses of 50% or greater (13.3%). Long-term results of infrainguinal bypass done below stenotic but hemodynamically normal aortoiliac vessels are not related to the amount of angiographically demonstrable inflow stenosis. Selection of patients for infrainguinal bypass on the basis of papaverine testing, irrespective of angiographic findings, eliminates unnecessary inflow procedures without detriment to long-term success.",

    "abstract": "Of 724 bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts performed for critical ischemia during a 6-year period, 165 (23%) failed and necessitated reoperation for continued limb salvage. Forty-three failures occurred in 199 femoral-above-knee-popliteal bypasses (F-AKP), 33 failures in 177 femoral-below-knee-popliteal bypasses (F-BKP), 52 failures in 182 femorodistal bypasses (F-D), 28 failures in 85 axillofemoral bypasses (Ax-F), and nine failures in 81 femorofemoral bypasses (F-F). Our reoperative approach consisted of dissection of the distal anastomosis, longitudinal incision in the hood of the graft directly over the anastomosis, and proximal graft thrombectomy. Intimal hyperplasia was treated by patch angioplasty, proximal or distal progression of atherosclerosis was treated by a graft extension, and thrombectomy alone was performed when no cause of graft failure was identified. More recently, a totally new bypass was constructed in 27 cases of F-BKP or F-D failures. Reoperations featuring graft salvage for failed extra-anatomic and F-AKP bypasses yielded 3-year patency rates from the time of first reoperation of 71% and 52%, respectively, whereas for F-BKP and F-D reoperations, 3-year patency rates were 13% and 15%, respectively, at 3 years. However, totally new grafts to a different outflow artery in these settings had 3-year patency rates of 48% and 39%. These data support the aggressive use of reoperation with graft salvage when F-AKP or extra-anatomic graft failure reproduces critical ischemia. Conversely, a new bypass to a virginal outflow site, preferably with autologous vein, should be performed when a polytetrafluoroethylene F-BKP or F-D bypass fails.",

In addition to the standard evaluation of these patients, we have used stable xenon-enhanced computed tomographic mapping of cerebral blood flow (Xe/CT CBF). This relatively new and potentially widely available CBF methodology, by measuring approximately 30,000 CBF values within each of three CT levels, provides a readily interpretable means of evaluating extremes of hemodynamic compromise within any or all vascular territories. In the past 30 months, Xe/CT CBF studies in 300 patients with occlusive vascular disease have identified nine patients with global low flow and nonhemispheric symptoms (vertigo, lightheadedness, and/or blurred vision). Blood pressures determined by ocular pneumoplethysmography of Gee were markedly abnormal with reduced ocular/brachial ratios. Each patient had a combination of both segmental carotid and vertebrobasilar occlusive disease. Each patient had a flow-augmenting procedure performed on the anterior circulation in an attempt to improve global flow: carotid endarterectomy (two patients), subclavian-external carotid bypass (one patient), and superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass (six patients). In each case disabling transient symptoms were relieved. There were no operative deaths, but one stroke occurred, probably as a result of a brief period of postoperative hypotension. Postoperative Xe/CT CBF studies show a long-term improved global CBF in all patients.",

    "abstract": "During a 7-year period, 4047 patients underwent a battery of noninvasive carotid tests before cardiac surgery. Two thirds of the patients with abnormal studies underwent carotid angiography. One hundred fifty-three patients (3.8%) had significant carotid disease, narrowing the luminal diameter by greater than 50%. The incidence of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident following cardiac surgery was 1.9% in those patients with no carotid disease and 9.2% in those patients with carotid lesions. The incidence of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident in 32 patients with inoperable (occluded) carotid vessels was 15.6% and in 121 patients with operable (stenotic) lesions was 7.4%. In the group of patients with stenosis, 57 patients underwent carotid operation with an 8.8% incidence of neurologic deficit. During the last 1 1/2 years, no patient with asymptomatic carotid stenosis underwent simultaneous carotid and coronary surgery. Four of 64 patients with combined lesions but no carotid surgery (6.3%) had a neurologic deficit, one of which was severe and permanent. The highest incidence of neurologic dysfunction occurred in patients with unilateral occlusions and contralateral stenosis. Four of 12 patients in this group had a deficit (three of seven patients underwent operation; one of five did not), one of which was permanent. The operative mortality rate after cardiac surgery was three times higher in patients with carotid disease than in those patients with normal carotid arteries. Combined carotid and coronary surgery is currently reserved for patients with neurologic symptoms and severe cardiac disease.",

    "abstract": "Delineation of neural, arterial, and venous components contributing to penile erectile failure is critical to proper patient selection for surgical interventions, particularly for a subset of men with impotence as the sole manifestation of pelvic arterial disease. In addition to obtaining a history and physical examination specific for disordered erectile function and vascular risk factors, we developed a sequence of testing to include noninvasive estimates of penile perfusion, pulse volume recording (PVR), and penile/brachial blood pressure indices (PBPI); somatosensory evoked potentials from dorsal penile (PEP) and posterior tibial nerve stimulation (SEP) and bulbocavernosus reflex time (BCR); stimulation of artificial erection with injection of papaverine (AE); and selective hypogastric-pudendal arteriography with patients under epidural anesthesia, and corpus cavernosography with AE. Three hundred fifty-three men complaining of impotence were screened by PVR and PBPI; among these 42 impotent men and 20 additional concurrent potent control subjects had evoked potentials and BCR measurements, and 55 men received one or more AE injections. On the basis of these results, angiographic investigation was recommended. Age and risk factors were similar in the two groups. Abnormal penile blood perfusion was associated significantly only with cigarette smoking (p less than 0.0001) or overt large vessel disease. Impotent men with (138) or without perfusion abnormalities (215) averaged 54 and 56 years of age, respectively; impotent men with normal flow patterns most commonly had treated hypertension or diabetes (79 of 215 men). Covert neurologic abnormalities were detected in 28 of 42 impotent men. Abnormal penile perfusion plus failure of AE predicted isolated ischiopudendal trunk or pudendal artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease is recognized as the major cause of perioperative and late death after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Routine coronary angiography and prophylactic myocardial revascularization for all significant lesions, regardless of symptoms, have been recommended as a means of reducing this mortality risk. We have advocated a more selective approach in which coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization are performed on the basis of cardiac symptoms. Studies have shown that this selective approach is just as effective as the prophylactic approach in reducing perioperative deaths. To evaluate the effect on late survival of selective myocardial revascularization on the basis of symptoms, we reviewed the preoperative coronary status and course of 485 patients who successfully underwent AAA repair between 1980 and 1985. Late survival was evaluated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with life expectancy of an age- and sex-matched population. Late survival of the entire group of patients was no different from that of the matched population. Patients with no preoperative evidence of coronary artery disease did significantly better than expected (p = 0.05), whereas those patients with uncorrected or previously bypassed coronary disease had survival no different from that expected. When age was considered as a variable, patients in their 50s and 60s had survival significantly worse than the matched population (p less than 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Patients in their 70s and 80s had survival as good as or better than the matched population, regardless of coronary status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Recurrent carotid stenosis occurs randomly in approximately 10% of patients undergoing endarterectomy. Previous studies have described several histologic features but have failed to clearly elucidate the pathogenesis of this disorder. To improve our understanding of this disease, we reviewed pathologic lesions from 20 patients with recurrent stenosis. All specimens had been fixed in formalin and were embedded in paraffin and had undergone routine microscopic studies. In addition, immunoperoxidase staining with anti-factor VIII for endothelial cells and anti-desmin and anti-actin for smooth muscle cells was performed. Recurrent stenosis had developed in 16 of the 20 specimens within 2 years of endarterectomy (early), whereas the remaining four cases occurred from 2 to 7 years after the original carotid endarterectomy (late). Endothelial cells were found lining the luminal surface of both early and late recurrent lesions. Six of sixteen early and three of four late specimens had areas of luminal surface covered with cells exhibiting immunoreactivity for anti-factor VIII. Cells showing immunoreactivity for actin or desmin and demonstrating the morphology of smooth muscle cells were found in 9 of 16 early restenotic lesions but in no late ones. Areas of endothelial cell lining of the recurrent carotid lesions in a substantial number of patients in this study represent a finding not previously described. The presence of these cells implies that a phase of the arterial healing after endarterectomy involves re-endothelialization. Contrary to previous reports, no significant role of thrombosis and/or intraplaque hemorrhage could be found to contribute to development of recurrent stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The use of the saphenous vein in situ is associated with unique problems that decrease primary graft patency (patency uninterrupted by revision). During the past 5 years, we have performed 192 in situ saphenous vein bypasses in 182 patients, including 61 to the popliteal artery, 128 to infrapopliteal arteries, and three to isolated popliteal artery segments. The operative indications were critical limb ischemia in 178 cases (93%), popliteal aneurysm in eight cases (4%), and disabling claudication in six cases (3%). A progressive decline in primary patency occurred after operation. The primary patency rate at 36 months was only 48% for femoropopliteal bypasses and was 58% for femorotibial bypasses. In contrast, the secondary patency rate (patency maintained by thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or revision) at 36 months was 89% and 80% for femoropopliteal and femorotibial bypasses, respectively. The improved secondary patency was due to postoperative surveillance of graft hemodynamics and the success of graft revision. Problems unique to the in situ technique (incomplete valve incision, residual arteriovenous fistula, graft torsion and entrapment) accounted for 58% of early (less than 30 days) graft revisions and 52% of late revisions. The use of Doppler spectral analysis at operation and duplex scanning after operation can locate unsuspected technical errors and identify grafts with low flow at increased risk for failure. The primary patency of the in situ bypass mandates objective assessment of valve incision sites at operation and a protocol of postoperative surveillance to identify grafts that require revision. Early surgical intervention of hemodynamically abnormal but patent in situ bypasses is rewarded by excellent secondary patency.",

Type IV EDs, the arterial-ecchymotic type, is of concern to vascular surgeons because it is frequently associated with spontaneous catastrophic bleeding. This article summarizes our experience with five members of a family and reviews the 31 patients with type IV EDs described in the literature. The 22 male and 14 female patients had a mean age of 26 years. The 36 patients included 23 with easy \"bruisability,\" 22 with hypermobility of their joints (especially the fingers), 13 with transparent skin, and 11 with excessive elasticity of the skin. The patients had 41 episodes of hemorrhage and 29 vascular surgical procedures. Twenty-nine of the patients had an aneurysm or a dissection, whereas eight patients had arteriovenous fistulas. Arteriography was associated with a complication rate of 67%. The prognosis for a patient with type IV EDs is poor; 44% die before surgery and 19% die during the operative period. Bleeding should be managed nonoperatively when possible. Fifty-one percent die before reaching 40 years of age. Arteriography should be avoided. The standard repair of aneurysms and perforations is unlikely to be successful because of marked vessel friability. Bleeding vessels should be repaired with buttressed sutures and no tension or should be ligated. Genetic counseling with assay of collagen production is recommended for family members.",

    "abstract": "Smoking has been linked to the development and progression of atherosclerosis but the mechanism by which smoking exerts its deleterious effects remains unknown. This study was designed to examine in a systematic way the effects of nicotine and carbon monoxide on platelets, arterial walls, and the heart. Results of experiments designed to assess the effect of nicotine and carbon monoxide on the production of prostacyclin (PGI2) by the rabbit heart are reported. Animals exposed to carbon monoxide had the carboxyhemoglobin raised to at least 12% by breathing an atmosphere enriched with carbon monoxide. Nicotine was infused at 50 micrograms/kg/hr for 1 week. Nicotine was measured by gas/liquid chromatography. PGI2 was measured by radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and its biologic activity was assessed by inhibition of platelet aggregation. Nicotine is concentrated in the heart and blood vessel wall and causes a statistically significant reduction in PGI2 production. Carbon monoxide raised PGI2 production significantly in all chambers, and the combination of nicotine and carbon monoxide further raised PGI2 production. The difference between the effects of nitrogen and carbon monoxide alone and nitrogen and a combination of nitrogen and carbon monoxide was significant in all chambers. It is hypothesized that nicotine exerts a direct metabolic effect in lowering PGI2 production. Carbon monoxide may make the endothelial cell relatively hypoxic, a powerful stimulus of PGI2 production, or less likely exert a direct toxic effect on the endothelial cell.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that a mismatch in compliance between a vascular graft and its host artery is detrimental to graft patency was tested by implanting paired arterial autografts, prepared with differential glutaraldehyde fixation of carotid arteries in the femoral arteries of dogs. These grafts differed only in circumferential compliance: they were 100% (compliant) vs. 40% (stiff) as compliant as the host artery. Their flow surfaces were equivalent, as determined by physicochemical measurements and scanning electron microscopy; both lacked viable cells, as determined by in vitro cell culture. In 14 dogs, eight stiff and two compliant grafts became occluded within 3 months, the latter doing so within 24 hours after their contralateral counterparts. Cumulative patencies were 85% and 37% for compliant and stiff grafts, respectively (p less than 0.05) and 100% and 43%, excluding the two dogs with bilateral graft failures (p less than 0.01). We conclude that even with near optimal flow surfaces, compliance mismatch is deleterious to graft patency.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 90% of endothelial cells that are seeded or cultured onto vascular prostheses are lost from the flow surface within 24 hours of implantation. To determine the contribution of leukocytes to endothelial cell loss, 111In-labeled, cultured canine jugular venous endothelial cells were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated polyester elastomer tubes measuring 4 mm inner diameter and 30 mm in length. Autogenous cell-lined tubes were implanted as bilateral carotid replacement grafts in six dogs made leukopenic by cyclophosphamide. Similar unilateral grafts were placed in 12 control dogs. Grafts were removed and perfusion-fixed from six control animals after 2 hours of in vivo arterial perfusion and from the other six animals after 6 hours of perfusion. One graft was removed and perfusion-fixed from each leukopenic animal after 2 hours of implantation and the other after 6 hours. Attachment of endothelial cells to the grafts was measured by indium-labeling technique. Retention of endothelium on grafts removed after 2 hours was measured by planimetric counting with scanning electron microscopy and on those removed after 6 hours by radioisotope quantification. Endothelial cell retention after 2 hours was 37.6% +/- 27.0% in control dogs and 97.0% +/- 3.4% in leukopenic animals (p less than 0.0007). After 6 hours retention was 35.9% +/- 23.2% in control animals and 86.5% +/- 6.0% in leukopenic animals (p less than 0.0009). Leukocyte surface activity was present in less than 1% of the leukopenic dogs compared with 8.5% of the other in vivo midgrafts after 2 hours. These results suggest that leukocytes play a significant role in the loss of seeded endothelium from vascular prostheses.",

    "abstract": "ECGF, a polypeptide of bovine hypothalamic derivation, is the most potent endothelial cell mitogen known, with mitogenic and chemotactic effects well demonstrated in vitro on human endothelial cells. These effects are synergized by heparin. In vivo re-endothelialization of blood-contacting biomaterials may be enhanced by bonding ECGF and heparin to prosthetic surfaces. Long woven Dacron (24 mm) and woven PDS vascular prostheses were treated first with human plasma fibronectin (10 micrograms/cm2). Porcine sodium heparin (20 micrograms/cm2) was added by means of fibronectin's heparin affinity. Pure 125I-ECGF (95% alpha, 5% beta; 1 ng/cm2) was next fixed by the heparin affinity of ECGF and followed by a second heparin layer (20 micrograms/cm2) to synergize with and stabilize ECGF. 125I-ECGF adherences were determined by scintillation counts. Attachment efficiency averaged 25%. Prostheses were interposed into rabbit aortas and harvested in triplicate from 0 to 30 days to establish in vivo washout curves. After explantation, residual 125I-ECGF was eluted from prostheses, and intact ECGF was identified by SDS gel electrophoresis. Similarly prepared but nonradioiodinated Dacron and PDS prostheses were explanted after 7 days and their ECGF eluted off for in vitro activity documentation. This ECGF retained its mitogenic properties, causing a 1000% to 1200% increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in test murine LE-II cells. Fibronectin-heparin-ECGF fixation to blood-contacting biomaterials may enhance spontaneous re-endothelialization and/or hasten the confluence of transplanted endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that standard knitted and woven fabric grafts are forever dependent on the suture material for anastomotic tensile strength. Clinical experience with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and double velour knitted grafts have shown that there is extensive fibrous capsular bonding between the graft and the surrounding tissues. This would lead to increased anastomotic tensile strength. To test this theory, 34 mongrel dogs underwent replacement of their infrarenal aortas with grafts made of PTFE (10 dogs), of double velour knitted Dacron (DVD, 11 dogs), of single velour knitted Dacron (SVD, 5 dogs), and of woven Dacron (WD, 8 dogs). One anastomosis was constructed with 5-0 Prolene and the opposite anastomosis was constructed with 5-0 Dexon (average absorption time, 21 days). In five grafts each of PTFE and DVD, as well as in all eight WD grafts, the midgraft was divided and resutured with 5-0 Dexon. All grafts were harvested together with adjacent proximal and distal aorta between 3 and 10 months from the time of implantation. The tensile strength of each anastomosis was measured with a tensiometer. The mean graft-to-artery (absorbable suture) anastomotic tensile strength, in pounds, for PTFE (14.3) and DVD (12.6) was significantly higher than that for SVD (6.9) or WD (7.2) (p less than 0.003). Graft-to-graft anastomotic tensile strength for PTFE (mean 17.3) was significantly better than that for DVD (mean 9.0; p less than 0.03) or WD (mean 7.9; p less than 0.001). Analysis of anastomotic tensile strength as a function of time revealed continued increase in PTFE in contrast to a slow decline with time in DVD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A classic approach involves left thoracotomy, with resection of the aberrant subclavian artery from its origin to the right border of the esophagus. To prevent possible ischemic complications, most surgeons favor revascularization of the distal subclavian artery. Thoracotomy has been the traditional approach for division or reimplantation of the aberrant right subclavian artery. We describe a modification (right supraclavicular incision) of an extrathoracic approach, which was first described by Orvald in 1972, to simplify simultaneous correction of dysphagia lusoria and revascularization of the right upper extremity.",

    "abstract": "Injury can occur to several of the cranial nerves during carotid endarterectomy. Among these, glossopharyngeal nerve injury is an uncommon complication because it is remote from the field of dissection in most carotid procedures. From more than 2000 carotid operations four cases of symptomatic ninth cranial nerve injury were identified. Analysis revealed that dissection cephalad to the level of the hypoglossal nerve was a common feature of each and severe functional disability can result from glossopharyngeal nerve paresis. When mobilization of this nerve and division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and styloid process become necessary for additional exposure, the risk of glossopharyngeal nerve injury increases. Specific recommendations are made regarding management and maneuvers to help reduce the incidence of this uncommon, yet potentially serious, complication.",

    "abstract": "From 1957 to 1985, 116 consecutive operations for recurrent carotid stenosis were performed in 99 patients at the University of California, San Francisco. Ninety-four patients underwent 103 reoperations for primary recurrent stenosis (nine patients had bilateral repairs). Seventy-two operations (70%) were performed to relieve cerebrovascular symptoms whereas the indication for 31 operations (30%) was high-grade stenosis. The cause of primary recurrent stenosis was myointimal hyperplasia (MIH) in 47 cases, whereas 56 were caused by recurrent atherosclerosis (ASO). Secondary recurrent stenosis developed in six patients from our own series (5.8%) and an additional six patients were referred after reoperation elsewhere. The 12 lesions in this group were evenly divided between MIH (six) and recurrent ASO (six). MIH resulted in a single tertiary recurrent stenosis. Myointimectomy or repeat endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty were the most commonly used techniques for repair of a primary recurrent stenosis. Secondary recurrent stenosis necessitated resection of the carotid bifurcation and graft interposition when caused by MIH. Secondary recurrent stenosis caused by ASO could be treated by repeat endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty in five of six cases. Five strokes occurred in the entire series (4.3%), resulting in two deaths. There were 23 cranial nerve palsies, which rarely persisted beyond 3 months. The morbidity and mortality rates for primary and secondary carotid reoperation are comparable to the original procedure and should not deter the vascular surgeon from reoperative carotid reconstruction whenever indicated.",

    "abstract": "During a study period from 1977 through 1984, 11 (0.4%) of 2651 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy at The Cleveland Clinic had early, symptomatic thrombosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and underwent urgent reoperations. With only two exceptions, neurologic deficits occurred after lucid intervals when the patients had recovered from general anesthesia and were discovered within the first 8 hours in three patients, within 8 to 24 hours in five patients, and on the second postoperative day in one patient. Surgical management consisted of thrombectomy alone in two patients, thrombectomy and vein patch angioplasty in eight patients, and thrombectomy of the external carotid artery with ligation of the ICA in a single patient in whom retrograde ICA flow could not be reestablished. Eight (73%) of the 11 patients recovered substantial neurologic function after reoperations, six of whom had complete or nearly complete resolution of their symptoms. One patient (9%) sustained a fatal hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. In a collected series of 41 patients from this study and other reports, prompt surgical treatment of thrombosis occurring after carotid endarterectomy was associated with clinical improvement in 61% of patients and appears to be the preferred approach to this catastrophic complication.",

    "abstract": "Injury to the accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) during carotid endarterectomy is rare; to date only three cases have been reported in the literature. Traction on the sternocleido-mastoid muscle was the proposed mechanism of injury in all three cases. Four cases of accessory nerve palsy occurred in 850 carotid endarterectomies performed between 1978 and 1986 at this institution, an incidence of 0.47%. All four patients had classic signs and symptoms of accessory nerve injury, which developed between 20 and 60 days after operation. The three most recent cases were examined specifically for accessory nerve injury in the immediate postoperative period and exhibited normal trapezius function. None had any other central nervous system dysfunction. Two of these patients regained full accessory nerve function and the most recent case is showing signs of reinnervation with conservative therapy. Isolated central nervous system and spontaneous accessory nerve palsies are exceptionally rare, and since any traction injury or transection should have been detected by postoperative examinations in three of four patients, we propose surgical scar formation as a mechanism of accessory nerve palsy after carotid endarterectomy. If such a palsy develops in the postoperative period, we recommend conservative therapy.",

    "abstract": "Sequential external pneumatic compression (SEPC) has been reported to decrease the incidence of acute deep venous thrombosis in postoperative patients by a direct mechanical action on the lower extremity veins and/or by inducing alterations in systemic fibrinolysis. To evaluate the effect of SEPC on venous function in the postoperative patient, pre- and postoperative venous capacitance (VC) and outflow (VO) were measured in a series of general surgical patients. In phase I, 17 limbs were evaluated in patients who had been fully ambulatory preoperatively and at complete bed rest postoperatively. VC decreased from 3.19 +/- 0.43 cc/100 cc of tissue (mean +/- standard error of the mean) preoperatively to 2.08 +/- 0.34 cc/100 cc of tissue postoperatively (p less than 0.05) and VO decreased from 87.2 +/- 10.6 cc/100 cc of tissue/min preoperatively to 58.1 +/- 8.7 cc/100 cc of tissue/min postoperatively (p less than 0.025). In phase II SEPC was begun preoperatively and continued for 24 hours postoperatively on one limb of 20 patients. SEPC prevented the decrease in VC and VO both in the pumped leg (VC-2.65 +/- 0.26 cc/100 cc of tissue preop, 2.40 +/- 0.18 cc/100 cc of tissue postop, p greater than 0.2; VO-72.3 +/- 5.9 cc/100 cc of tissue/min preop, 66.2 +/- 5.3 cc/100 cc of tissue/min postop, p greater than 0.2) and in the unpumped limb (VC-2.85 +/- 0.18 cc/100 cc of tissue preop, 2.41 +/- 0.24 cc/100 cc of tissue postop, p greater than 0.05; VO-66.1 +/- 5.2 cc/100 cc of tissue/min preop, 66.7 +/- 6.7 cc/100 cc of tissue/min postop, p greater than 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To investigate the influence of operation sequence and staging on the outcome of aortic graft infection, we studied the mortality and amputation rates and incidence of new graft infection involving the extra-anatomic bypass (EAB) among 101 patients treated for secondary aortoenteric fistula (N = 43) or primary perigraft infection (N = 58). Patients were retrospectively grouped according to the operative treatment technique. Seven patients underwent infected graft removal (IGR) followed immediately by EAB (traditional). Fifty-seven patients were revascularized first, followed by immediate IGR in 38 patients (sequential) or by delayed IGR in 19 patients (staged). The median interoperative interval for the staged group was 5 days (range 2 to 31 days). Twenty patients underwent simultaneous IGR and in-line autogenous reconstruction (synchronous) and finally in 15 patients treatment consisted of IGR only with no extremity revascularization (none). The mean follow-up interval for all patients was 36.8 months. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality rate (traditional, 43%; sequential, 24%; and staged, 26%) or incidence of new graft infection (traditional, 43%; sequential, 18%; or staged, 16%) among those patients treated with EAB, although there was a trend toward an improved outcome with either sequential or staged treatment. There was a significantly lower amputation rate among sequential patients (11%) (p = 0.038) but not staged patients (16%) (p = 0.171) when compared with traditional treatment (43%). Staged operative treatment was associated with significantly less physiologic stress than sequential treatment as reflected by multiple perioperative metabolic variables (95% confidence limits). The treatment groups were comparable in the incidence of aortoenteric fistulas, culture-negative infections, emergent procedures, and appropriate antibiotic use. We conclude that reversed sequence or staged operative treatment of infected aortic grafts can be performed with no increased patient risk. Although traditional or sequential treatment may be required in the setting of acute hemorrhage, the staged operative approach is recommended for the treatment of chronic aortic graft infections.",

    "abstract": "We studied the adaptive response of the arterial wall and intimal thickening under conditions of increased flow in an atherogenic model. Blood flow was increased by construction of an arteriovenous fistula between the right iliac artery and vein in six cynomolgus monkeys fed a diet containing 2% cholesterol and 25% peanut oil. The left iliac artery served as the control. Serum cholesterol increased from 135 +/- 22 mg/dl to 880 +/- 129 mg/dl during the experiment. After 6 months, blood flow in the right iliac artery (420 +/- 95 ml/min) was 10 times greater than in the left iliac artery (44 +/- 9 ml/min, p less than 0.005). Flow velocity in the right iliac artery (31 +/- 6 cm/sec) was more than twofold greater than in the left (12 +/- 1 cm/sec, p less than 0.05). Despite the marked difference in blood flow and flow velocity, calculated wall shear stress was the same in both the right (16 +/- 4 dynes/cm2) and left iliac vessels (15 +/- 2 dynes/cm2) because of a twofold increase in lumen diameter (p less than 0.001) of the right iliac artery. Shear stress in the aorta was also normal (12 +/- 2 dynes/cm2). There was no difference in plaque deposition or mean intimal thickness between the right and left iliac arteries. In the right iliac artery there was a twofold increase in media cross-sectional area (p less than 0.001) but no change in media thickness or total wall thickness. Tangential wall tension and tangential wall stress were two times greater on the right than on the left (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Traumatic arteriovenous fistulas of the mesenteric circulation are extremely rare, with only 15 operated cases reported in the English language literature that involved the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Although surgical intervention has been considered the most successful method to treat traumatic mesenteric arteriovenous fistulas, percutaneous transcatheter embolization has been occasionally advocated in the management of small iatrogenic fistulas. We report a case of a gunshot wound patient who had an 8 cm abdominal aortic false aneurysm, as well as a high-flow arteriovenous communication between the superior mesenteric artery and vein, which were successfully treated by a combination of aorto-superior mesenteric bypass and postoperative percutaneous transcatheter embolization.

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are rare, usually benign, neoplasms of the extra-adrenal paraganglion system. They are almost always nonfunctional. The diagnosis is generally confirmed by an angiogram that shows a vascular tumor enlarging the space between the internal and external carotid arteries. A 55-year-old man with hypertension and episodes of flushing, palpitations, and dizziness was treated for a firm, nonmobile mass measuring 3 x 2 cm at the left carotid bifurcation. Plasma and urine catecholamines, and the vanilylmandelic acid/creatinine ratios were elevated. Carotid arteriograms showed a vascular mass displacing the vessels, but the space between the arteries was narrowed rather than enlarged, and an atherosclerotic plaque was present. At operation the CBT was removed by resection of the bifurcation and with a temporary shunt a saphenous vein graft was inserted between the common and internal carotid arteries. Pathologic examination revealed a typical paraganglionoma. Although most CBTs produce catecholamines, only 11 patients have been reported to have elevated plasma and urine levels, and most were symptomatic. Since these tumors slowly increase in size, early surgical removal is recommended, even in asymptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "When renal transplant recipients undergo aortic surgery, blood supply to the renal graft is interrupted while the aorta is clamped. Several innovative ways of using shunts have been described to preserve blood flow to the transplanted kidney during such surgery on the assumption that temporary warm ischemia of the renal transplant is poorly tolerated. We have performed aortic surgery in four renal transplant recipients without the use of any form of graft protection. One patient underwent urgent operation to treat an expanding aortic aneurysm and the other three had elective surgery for aortoiliac occlusive disease. Ischemic times ranged from 30 to 45 minutes. Two of the four patients had a temporary rise in serum creatinine levels. No patient required hemodialysis. We conclude that in selected renal transplant recipients, aortic surgery can be safely undertaken without graft protection.",

Of the 62 limbs studied, 24 were normal, 20 had primary varicose veins, and 18 had deep valvular incompetence. The results indicate that the photoplethysmographic refilling time can provide a good separation between the three groups when the test is performed in the standing, but not in the sitting, position. However, the test is qualitative because we found a lack of correlation between the short refilling times in limbs with deep venous insufficiency and the ambulatory venous pressure.",

Patch graft angioplasties were used selectively in patients because they had undergone previous carotid endarterectomy or had small-caliber vessels. There were no postoperative infections, occlusions, emboli, stroke, or pseudoaneurysms. In addition, no clinically detectable recurrent stenoses developed in this high-risk group of patients. Twenty-four of the 27 patients available for follow-up were screened for asymptomatic stenoses with spectral analysis and B-mode imaging; there was no sign of hemodynamically significant recurrent stenosis in this group. These encouraging results support the continued selective use of Dacron patch graft angioplasty in carotid surgery.",

    "abstract": "Innovations in therapy for peripheral vascular disease include laser vessel welding and angioscopy-assisted intraluminal laser instrumentation. Vascular tissue fusion by laser occurs at energy levels lower than those required to coagulate or vaporize. CO2, argon, and Nd:YAG (1.06 micron) lasers have all been reported to fuse anastomoses in microvessels, but adequate welding of larger veins and arteries (3 to 8 mm in diameter) has only been accomplished with the argon laser. Laser welds heal comparably to sutured wounds but do not have the chronic foreign body reaction and disorientation of elastin and collagen associated with sutures. Preliminary evidence suggests that argon laser-welded anastomoses have less intimal hyperplasia than sutured anastomoses. Laser welding may also be a useful adjunct for sealing intimal flaps during endarterectomy. Additional work is needed to determine the mechanism, optimal parameters, and wavelengths required for vascular tissue fusion by laser. Direct application of laser light intraluminally has thus far been associated with a high incidence of vessel perforation. Angioscopy-assisted delivery of a metal hot-tip probe shows promise for angioplasty of occluded medium-sized arteries and for valvulotomy in in situ vein bypasses.",

    "abstract": "Neurologic deficits evident when patients initially awaken from surgery are generally due to intraoperative embolization or inadequate cerebral protection in patients with marginal cerebral perfusion; neurologic deficits occurring in the immediate postoperative period are usually related to acute carotid occlusion or embolization. However, in a small subset of patients, transient postoperative neurologic dysfunction seems to be related to a syndrome of cerebral hyperperfusion rather than a lack of adequate cerebral blood flow. This study describes the courses of 10 patients with classic findings of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. Typically, this syndrome occurred in patients with longstanding severe chronic cerebral ischemia and occurred after correction of a very high-grade carotid stenosis. Intraoperatively, there was often a dramatic increase in xenon-labeled cerebral blood flows, with postocclusion flows sometimes attaining three to four times baseline levels. Postoperatively, the patients initially did well. However, over the next several days, many of them began to complain of unilateral headache on the operated side and subsequently had seizures. Electroencephalography obtained during this period uniformly revealed periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges on the side of the brain ipsilateral to the endarterectomy. Although neurologic dysfunction fully resolved in all of the patients in this group, it is possible that intracerebral hemorrhage may occur in some patients with hyperperfusion syndrome. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is believed to be related to preoperative loss of cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms caused by chronic cerebral ischemia.",

    "abstract": "To define the benefits and risks of renal revascularization or nephrectomy in patients with both severe hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency, we analyzed 98 patients who underwent renovascular operations after serum creatinine levels exceeded 2 mg/dl. This subset of patients was selected from a retrospective review of 652 renal operations performed at the Mayo Clinic for renovascular disease between 1970 and 1981. Special attention was given to the type of operations, their effect on hypertension and renal function, specific factors that affected operative deaths, and late survival. Unilateral renal operations were performed in 48 patients with bilateral procedures in 50. Simultaneous aortic reconstruction was necessary in 55 patients (56%). Postoperative diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg in 55% of patients and 90 to 100 mm Hg in an additional 33%. Seventy-six percent of patients required less antihypertension medication. Serum creatinine improved or stabilized in 69%. Ninety percent of patients avoided any early or late renal dialysis. The operative mortality rate was 7.1% and tended to be higher in patients with a serum creatinine greater than 3 mg/dl and in those with past myocardial infarction (p = 0.05). The late survival rate was 64% at 5 years. The main cause of operative and late death was myocardial infarction. In conclusion, most patients with renovascular hypertension and early chronic renal insufficiency can be benefited by surgical revascularization or nephrectomy. Future improvement in early and late survival may require a more aggressive approach to the identification and correction of significant coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "The improved patency rates of in situ vein grafts are attributed to better flow characteristics, anastomotic \"fit,\" and intimal preservation. This study compared the early changes in intimal morphology and fibrinolytic activity of in situ and reversed vein bypass grafts from mongrel dogs. Four to six centimeter in situ and reversed vein segments were used to bypass left and right femoral and internal carotid arteries, respectively. Heparin (100 U/kg) was administered before arterial clamping. Anastomoses were fashioned end to side and the intervening artery was ligated. Fifty-two grafts were harvested at day 1 (12 grafts), day 7 (16 grafts), day 14 (12 grafts), and 12 weeks (12 grafts). The veins were analyzed for histologic changes by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The fibrinolytic activity of the grafts was assayed by the fibrin slide and fibrin plate techniques. There were no significant differences in morphology or fibrinolytic activity between the reversed and in situ grafts at any time period. These findings indicate that the improved patency rates associated with in situ grafts are not dependent on improved preservation of intimal structure or fibrinolytic activity.",

    "abstract": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to detect segmental ventricular wall motion abnormalities (SWMAs) associated with ischemia in 49 high-risk patients who had 50 major vascular procedures, including 23 infrarenal aortic, five suprarenal aortic, 14 carotid, seven distal, and one axillofemoral reconstructions. A modified gastroscope tipped with an echocardiographic transducer was inserted into the esophagus and positioned behind the heart to obtain a reproducible cross-sectional view of the left ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles. Twelve patients (24%) had SWMA at baseline, probably representing areas of old infarction. Fourteen patients (28%) had new intraoperative SWMAs. Ten of 14 patients were successfully treated and wall motion was normalized. One of the four patients with persistent SWMA suffered a nonfatal subendocardial infarct; another patient suffered intraoperative cardiac arrest and died. No infarcts were documented in the 10 patients successfully treated. The mortality rate in the entire high-risk group was 6%. Alterations in ventricular wall motion were noted in almost 50% of high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Seventy-one percent of acute SWMAs were reversed without any evidence of myocardial infarction. TEE allowed early recognition of evolving myocardial ischemia and facilitated immediate and specific fluid and pharamcologic interventions. Continued application of this technique may reduce the incidence and morbidity of perioperative cardiac complications.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine what percentage of patients could avoid the transfusion of any homologous bank blood products during elective abdominal aortic surgery with a recently developed semicontinuous, rapid autotransfusion device. Fifty patients (26 with abdominal aortic aneurysms and 24 with aortic occlusive disease) prospectively received intraoperative autologous transfusion (group 1) and were matched for comparison with 50 patients receiving homologous blood without use of any autotransfusion equipment (group 2). For the entire perioperative period, 34 group 1 patients (68%) received only their own autotransfused blood and no other homologous blood components compared with group 2 in which 48 patients (96%) required some bank blood (p less than 0.0001). Rapid autotransfusion reduced usage of homologous red cell transfusion by 75%. The mean postoperative hemoglobin was similar in both groups (group 1, 11.91 gm/dl vs. group 2, 11.90 gm/dl, p = 0.73). Rapid autotransfusion was not associated with significant hemolysis, air embolism, or coagulopathy and did not increase morbidity or death. By eliminating the need for any bank blood components in most patients, rapid autotransfusion minimizes the risk of blood-borne diseases and transfusion reactions. New rapid autotransfusion devices offer a distinct advantage over past equipment and allow significant changes in current transfusion practices during elective abdominal aortic reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "One hundred sixteen patients with bilateral amputation as a result of severe ischemia were reviewed to evaluate their rehabilitation potential. Seventy patients were male and 46 were female; ages ranged from 31 to 92 years (mean 68 years). The operative mortality rate after the second amputation was 9.5% (11 of 116 patients). The time from the first to second amputation ranged from zero to 144 months (mean 23 months). Follow-up from 1 to 14 years was available on all patients. Sixty percent of the patients surviving the postoperative period were alive at 2 years and 40% at 5 years. Of the 105 patients available for follow-up, only 27 (26%) were able to use bilateral prostheses. Twenty-three (85%) of these patients were ambulatory after their first amputation. Four patients not walking after their first amputation became ambulatory after their second. All four had bilateral below-knee amputations. Of the 78 patients unable to use a bilateral prosthesis, 68 (87%) were able to function independently and 10 became bedridden. Successful prosthetic rehabilitation in the bilateral amputee appears primarily dependent on the use of a prosthesis after the first amputation. The acceptable long-term survival and the number of patients who became independent in their activities justify an aggressive approach to the rehabilitation of the bilateral amputee.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports have demonstrated that endothelial cell seeding of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts enhances short-term patency. This experiment was undertaken to study its impact on the long-term patency of a highly porous, experimental PTFE graft and to determine whether increasing the internodal distance of the graft material resulted in increased proliferation of the subendothelium. Ten centimeter long, 4 mm internal diameter segments of an unreinforced, experimental PTFE graft were implanted into 36 mongrel dogs as carotid interpositions. In each animal, one graft was seeded with autologous endothelial cells, enzymatically derived from the external jugular veins, whereas the contralateral graft was treated in identical fashion except that endothelial cells were not added to the preclot mixture. Nineteen animals were killed at 12 weeks; six at 22 weeks; eight at 26 weeks; and three at 52 weeks. The mean follow-up period was 20.1 weeks. The overall patency rate was 58.3% (21 of 36 grafts) for seeded grafts vs. 27.8% (10 of 36 grafts) for control grafts (p less than 0.01). The thrombus-free area was planimetrically measured at 83.4% +/- 4.5% in seeded grafts vs. 55.1% +/- 9.7% in control grafts (p less than 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of a confluent cellular monolayer in seeded grafts, whereas control grafts exhibited a variable coagulum of fibrin, platelets, and endothelial cells. The thickness of the subendothelial layer varied from 56 to 95 micron with no progressive increase in thickness between 12 and 52 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence of internal carotid arterial stenosis in an unselected asymptomatic population over 50 years of age, 102 volunteers from one church congregation were studied with ultrasonic arteriography, spectral analysis, and ocular pneumoplethysmography. Fifty subjects were 50 to 59 years old; 33 were 60 to 69 years of age; and 19 were older than 70 years. Forty-five were men and 57 were women. Risk factors included diabetes mellitus (4%), heart disease (9%), hypertension (24%), peripheral vascular disease (20%), and smoking (46%). Disease was found in 11 subjects (10.8%). Of the 204 internal carotid arteries, 13 (6.4%) were abnormal. Two vessels had 20% diameter stenosis; four had stenoses of 20% to 39%; five had stenoses of 40% to 59%; one had a stenosis of 60% to 79%; and one was occluded. Stenoses greater than 40% occurred in 4% of the 50 to 59 years of age group, 6% of the 60 to 69 years of age group, and 11% of the greater than 70 years of age group. Although the prevalence of carotid stenosis was increased in all subjects who had risk factors, only the association with heart disease reached statistical significance. These results indicate that carotid stenosis is present in an appreciable number of asymptomatic subjects over the age of 50 years and suggest that its prevalence is associated with age and other risk factors.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated morphologic and functional characteristics of tissue reactions to compound prostheses of 69% absorbable polyglactin 910 (PG910) and 31% nonabsorbable polypropylene in the rabbit. Forty-two woven PG910/polypropylene prostheses (24 X 4 mm internal diameter) implanted into rabbit infrarenal aortas were harvested after 2 weeks to 12 months. Each explant was photographed and sectioned for light microscopy and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Randomly selected explants underwent either compliance and bursting strength measurements or assays of production of prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolites by luminal surfaces of both regenerated conduits and normal control aortas in response to administered sodium arachidonate. Results showed 100% patency with no aneurysms and 2% stenoses (1 of 42 prostheses). Confluent endothelial-like cellular luminal surfaces covering oriented smooth muscle-like myofibroblasts comprised the inner capsules whose thicknesses stabilized at 1 to 2 months. Only residual polypropylene remained in the prostheses after 2 months. Compliance studies reflected a 0.65 mm (14%) change over a pressure range of 0 to 160 mm Hg. All regenerated prosthesis-tissue complexes had bursting strengths greater than the proximal perianastomotic native aortas, which burst between 600 and 2000 mm Hg. At 1 month the rate of production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha per square millimeter of surface area of experimental segments was normal. Production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha by experimental segments at 3 months had increased fourfold whereas thromboxane B2 (TxB2) production remained unchanged. The 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TxB2 ratio increased from 1 to 4 months. This study demonstrates clinically efficacious morphologic, mechanical, and biochemical characteristics of PG910/polypropylene-elicited vascular prosthesis-tissue complexes.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports have suggested that duplex ultrasonography might supplant arteriography as a guide to operative decision making in selected patients with cerebrovascular disease. This study was undertaken to test that tenet in patients with focal carotid territory symptoms. Seventy-two patients having independently interpreted arch and selective carotid arteriography and duplex scanning underwent 78 carotid endarterectomies. Operative specimens were analyzed in all cases and used as the standard in evaluating the accuracy of the preoperative studies. All patients had disease found at the time of operation. The sensitivity of duplex scanning was 99% vs. 91% for arteriography (p = 0.06). In seven cases the scan accurately predicted disease in patients with normal arteriograms and in a single case the scan was read as normal in a patient with a smooth minimally stenotic plaque read as an irregular 30% stenosis on arteriography. The accuracy of duplex scanning was markedly superior to arteriography in detecting intimal surface abnormalities (92% vs. 64%, p less than 0.001) and ulceration (90% vs. 54%, p less than 0.001). There was no difference between duplex scan and arteriography (p = 1.0) in predicting a greater or less than 50% stenosis (accuracy, 94% for arteriogram; 92% for duplex scanning). Of the patients with preoperative potentially reversible symptoms, 97% were free of symptoms at a mean follow-up of 9 months after operation. Eighty-nine percent (17 of 19 patients) of patients with concomitant, ipsilateral, intracranial, or intrathoracic cerebrovascular disease were free of symptoms after carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "With the use of duplex sonography, quantitative vertebral artery flow measurements have been made in 283 patients who had nonlocalizing symptoms of cerebral ischemia suggestive of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Net vertebral artery flow was calculated by adding flows from the right and left sides. When net vertebral flow was greater than 200 ml/min, 89 of 148 patients (60%) were found to have a significant stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) in one or both internal carotid arteries. Conversely, when net flow was less than 200 ml/min, 101 of 135 patients (75%) had normal or only mildly diseased carotid system (p less than 0.001). When compared with otherwise matched groups of asymptomatic patients or patients with lateralizing hemispheric symptoms, those with nonlocalizing symptoms were much more likely to have net flow less than 200 ml/min. For the nonlocalizing symptom group this was 135 of 283 patients (48%) compared with only 72 of 208 asymptomatic patients (35%, p = 0.005) and 110 of 310 patients with hemispheric symptoms (35%, p = 0.003). Duplex sonography appears to offer a noninvasive technique for the functional hemodynamic evaluation of patients with suspected vertebrobasilar insufficiency, with the capability to distinguish those patients whose symptoms may be related to thromboembolic carotid artery disease, true vertebrobasilar ischemia, or some other cause.",

    "abstract": "A recent experience with infrainguinal graft infections was reviewed in an effort to identify factors related to limb loss and mortality. The records of 32 patients who had operative treatment of 33 episodes of infrainguinal graft infection between 1978 and 1985 were reviewed to evaluate the effects of 20 factors possibly affecting outcome. The amputation rate was 79%. Of the 20 factors studied, only the presence of overt limb sepsis was associated with the need for amputation, with 100% of patients having limb sepsis requiring amputation vs. 72% of patients without limb sepsis (p = 0.03). The in-hospital mortality rate was 22%. Eighty-six percent of the deaths were due to ongoing sepsis. Again, a single factor was associated with death. Five of the 12 patients (42%) in whom preservation of axial flow was attempted died in contrast to only 2 of 20 patients (10%) who did not have attempted arterial reconstruction (p = 0.04). Limb salvage did not occur in any of the patients in whom preservation of axial flow was attempted and nine required above-knee amputation. Thirteen of the remaining 20 patients had occluded femoral vessels either because of operative ligation (nine) or previous thrombosis (four). Above-knee amputations healed in all but one of these 13 patients. Determined attempts at increasing limb preservation were associated with no improvement in amputation rate or level and were accompanied by an unacceptably high mortality rate. Aggressive control of sepsis through the early amputation of septic limbs after graft removal may improve survival without further detriment to limb preservation.",

    "abstract": "Small-diameter, thin-walled latex tubes, through which a blood-simulating agent (0.1% suspension of simethicone in 0.9% sodium chloride) flowed at controlled rates, were embedded at varying depths in a tissue-mimicking matrix of powered graphite suspended in 4% agar. A continuous-wave (CW) Doppler probe was mounted at a 45-degree angle to the flow and passed transversely over the tube by a motorized drive mechanism at a rate of 0.42 mm/sec. Flow rates through the tubes were monitored with electromagnetic flow probes. The maximum depth from which quantitatively reliable signals could be obtained was 1.2 cm for 10 MHz probes and 3.3 cm for 5 MHz probes. Qualitative detection of flow was possible to a depth of 3.1 cm for 10 MHz probes and 7.0 cm for 5 MHz probes. The distances from the tube center for obtaining quantitatively reliable signals were limited to +/- 0.9 mm with a 10 MHz probe and +/- 1.8 mm with a 5 MHz probe. Qualitatively useful signals could be detected +/- 2.9 mm from the beam center by the 10 MHz probes and +/- 4.4 mm by the 5 MHz probes indicating a need for cautious interpretation as an interfering signal might be generated by any vessel within that range. Twenty percent of the randomly tested CW probes were considered unsuitable for use in quantitating blood flow, which underscores the importance of probe characterization before use.",

Therefore, it is important to make the diagnosis of infection to provide a reasonable chance for survival. Clinical signs of infection are usually apparent in the postoperative period. If absent, the diagnosis becomes more difficult.

This is especially true during the first 2 weeks after operation. CT-guided fine needle aspiration can provide a safe and reliable means to answer this clinical question.",

    "abstract": "One hundred two femoral-infrapopliteal bypasses, in which reversed autogenous saphenous vein grafts were used, were performed from January 1978 to July 1984, in 94 patients with severe claudication (14%) or threatened limb loss (86%). Follow-up examinations at 3-month intervals during the first 18 months and at 6-month intervals thereafter were performed to document the return of ischemic symptoms or loss of peripheral pulses. Ankle pressure index and pulse volume recordings were also measured. A decrease in ankle pressure index equal to or greater than 0.2 or a pulse volume recording decrease of 5 mm or more with or without confirmatory symptoms were indications for repeat arteriography. Twenty-two primary graft or anastomotic stenoses were discovered in 19 grafts during follow-up. Seventy-eight percent of these lesions were treated primarily by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the remainder were treated by short proximal interposition grafts or patch graft angioplasty. Twenty-five grafts occluded during follow-up and all of these were considered to have failed for purpose of life-table analysis. Stenotic lesions, which were corrected before occlusion, were listed as continuously patent under secondary patency and as failed under primary patency life-table analysis. The secondary graft patency rate was 70% at 5 years, which was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than the primary patency rate (47%), which was obtained without intervention. This 23% differential represents graft salvage achieved by careful surveillance and is reflected not only by improved patency but also by high limb salvage rates (86%) observed at 5 years.",

    "abstract": "The supraceliac aorta has received little attention as an inflow site of bypass graft origin for mesenteric arterial reconstruction; this article describes our experience with its use in 10 patients. Ten patients underwent bypass grafts (three vein and seven prosthetic grafts) from the supraceliac aorta incorporating the celiac axis to the superior mesenteric artery. All patients had two- or three-vessel mesenteric arterial occlusion. No operative deaths occurred. Nine patients were studied with postoperative arteriography. Nine of ten patients have had satisfactory results on follow-up from 5 to 99 months (mean 43 months), although two patients required operative revision to achieve this. The operative technique is described, including approach to the aorta in the lower mediastinum via upper abdominal exposure and pancreatic displacement to expose the superior mesenteric artery. This method permits avoidance of the infrarenal aorta, if desired because of atherosclerotic disease or previous operation. Antegrade supraceliac aortomesenteric grafts avoid turbulence and compression of conventional \"retrograde\" bypass beneath the mesentery. We conclude that supraceliac aortic grafts provide a useful visceral artery reconstruction technique.",

    "abstract": "We developed an animal model to reproduce hematogenous seeding of vascular grafts with Staphylococcus aureus. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts were implanted in 41 dogs as thoracoabdominal aortic bypasses for six durations of implantation between 2 hours and 6 months. The inoculum containing an average of 10(8) viable bacteria/ml was then injected intravenously in 1 minute. Normal dog aortas were used as controls. They entrapped very few bacteria (0.7 +/- 1.7 colony-forming unit [CFU]/cm2). Colonization of ePTFE grafts was maximal after 2 hours of implantation (589 +/- 733 CFU/cm2). Bacterial entrapment decreased after 2 days (225 +/- 315 CFU/cm2, p less than 0.001) and 8 days (70 +/- 115 CFU/cm2, p less than 0.001) of implantation, but it was similar after 8 days, 1 month (83 +/- 90 CFU/cm2), or 6 months (93 +/- 143 CFU/cm2) of implantation. Colonization of ePTFE measured after 2 months of implantation (371 +/- 591 CFU/cm2) was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than after 1 or 6 months of implantation. More than 500 CFU/cm2 were seen in 37% of the prosthetic fragments tested after 2 hours of exposure to blood; 99% of the fragments tested after 6 months of implantation trapped less than 500 CFU/cm2. Scanning electron microscopy showed that staphylococci were mostly seen on native fibrin deposits, particularly after 2 hours and 2 months of implantation. That persistent susceptibility of a flow surface devoid of endothelium to hematogenous bacterial colonization has to be taken into account to prevent delayed graft infections. Furthermore, it would be important to compare the ePTFE with other types of grafts whose healing phenomena are different.",

Ninety-two percent of the patients were considered to have good results (30% cured and 62% improved). Four patients were classified as unsuccessfully treated; one died postoperatively of myocardial infarction. All patients underwent late angiographic studies, with only one graft thrombosis being identified. No evidence of anastomotic stenosis, graft dilatation, or false aneurysm occurred during the follow-up period.

    "abstract": "To investigate the influence of hemodynamic conditions on intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts, two experimental models of canine femoral arteries were prepared. In group I, in which an autologous vein graft was transplanted under abnormal flow conditions (distal poor runoff), intimal thickening gradually developed and reached 358 +/- 33 microns at 8 months, whereas no thickening was observed under normal flow conditions at any time throughout the observation period. In group II the thickened intima, which developed under abnormal flow conditions for 1 month, was reimplanted into the contralateral leg under normal flow conditions. The thickness of the intima markedly regressed to about 66% at 1 month, 50% at 3 months, and 25% at 8 months, respectively, whereas no regression of the thickened intima was observed under continued abnormal flow conditions. Electron microscopic studies revealed that the thickened intima in group I was composed of proliferation of transformed smooth muscle cells with a marked increase in the mitochondria, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and an abundant fibrous matrix, whereas with the regressed thickness of the intima of group II, the smooth muscle cells were spindle-shaped with distinct myofibrillae. These results provide pertinent data on the process involved in the intimal thickening in cases of graft placement.",

Nineteen procedures were performed for symptomatic lesions in all cases except one. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths. During a mean follow-up of 44.7 months, no new strokes occurred.

    "abstract": "From 1973 through 1984, graft replacement of infrarenal aortic aneurysms (N = 56) or occlusive disease (N = 33) was performed in conjunction with simultaneous renal revascularization in 89 patients. Isolated renal artery stenosis was corrected by unilateral reconstruction in 56 patients (63%), but the remaining 33 (37%) had diffuse involvement that required either bilateral renal artery grafts or unilateral revascularization of solitary kidneys. The incidence of hypertension (greater than 180/90 mm Hg) refractory to preoperative medical therapy (88%), severe coronary disease documented by angiography (40%), and postoperative azotemia (33%) or oliguric renal failure (15%) was significantly higher among patients with bilateral renal artery disease (p less than 0.05). In addition, this group had twice the early mortality rate (15%) of patients having unilateral renal artery lesions (7.1%). During a mean follow-up interval of 37 months, medical control of hypertension was enhanced in 46 of the 80 operative survivors (58%), and renal function improved or remained stable in 63 survivors (79%). Five-year actuarial survival presently is 65% for the entire series, with a cumulative mortality rate of 38% among patients who underwent aneurysm resection (mean age 64 years) in comparison to 15% (p = 0.03) for those patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (mean age 60 years).",

    "abstract": "From December 1980 to December 1985, 54 patients underwent 56 lower extremity arterial procedures with the use of lesser saphenous vein (LSV) as graft material. LSV was used in all cases because a satisfactory greater saphenous vein (GSV) was unavailable to accomplish the proposed revascularization. Indications for operation were rest pain, ulceration, and gangrene (74%), and 26% had claudication alone. Fifty of the 56 procedures were femorotibial and femoroperoneal bypasses. Three graft combinations were used: LSV alone (29), lesser saphenous vein and other autogenous vein composites (LSV/AUTO) (14), and lesser saphenous vein with synthetic composite grafts (LSV/SYN) (13). Graft patency rates were determined by life-table analysis. The 3-year patency rate for LSV was 60% and for LSV/AUTO was 38%. LSV/SYN graft composites had a graft patency rate at 18 months of 21%. These data suggest that the LSV may function as an autogenous venous graft for lower extremity revascularization when sufficient GSV is not available.",

    "abstract": "Controversy regarding efficacy and durability of distal bypass grafting of the diabetic patient exists. A 22-year-long series of 259 vascular procedures with 100% follow-up (57% in diabetic individuals) is examined to compare these results with those of non-diabetic patients. Extensive review of predisposing factors, operative indications, preoperative medical evaluation, as well as techniques and peculiarities of angiography is rendered. Peripheral arterial case mix between the two groups is examined. The high utilization rate of solely venous conduits (94%) in diabetics compared with 76% in nondiabetics, along with anastomosis site selection, provides the most reasonable explanation for the successful outcome in both groups. Modifications in revascularization techniques contributing to successful outcome are presented. In the diabetic patients, both the cumulative graft patency rate (63%) and the limb salvage rate (77%) at 6 years were superior to those of the non-diabetics (52% and 65%, respectively). Diabetes mellitus does not predispose the person requiring revascularization for limb salvage to a lesser likelihood of success.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathy, peripheral ischemia, and an altered host defense make the diabetic patient particularly prone to the development of infected foot ulcers. Successful treatment must be directed at these three primary pathologic situations. Since a limb-threatening infection carries a 25% risk of major amputation, early and prompt recognition and reporting of all foot problems are essential. Neuropathy requires total rest of the injured part. An altered host defense requires knowledge of the bacteria involved and proper use of antibiotics. It requires strict adherence to sound surgical principles that ensure debridement of all necrotic material and adequate dependent drainage of the wound while conserving as much viable skin and tissue for later revision or conservative amputations. Once sepsis is controlled, ischemic extremities can be revascularized. Because of the peculiar nature of the diabetic's vascular disease, revascularization procedures require the maximum skill and experience of the operating vascular surgeon. After revascularization, revisions or more conservative distal amputations can be achieved. Patient and physician education and understanding still remain essential not only to prevention but to successful management of all diabetic foot-related problems.",

    "abstract": "Newer culture techniques have demonstrated that diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial, involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. These infections are characteristically foul-smelling and create immense tissue destruction. Occasionally, despite the absence of clostridial organisms, subcutaneous gas may be present. The importance of adequate surgical debridement has been emphasized. In the event of advancing, unremitting infection involving the foot, ankle guillotine amputation may be a life-saving technique. Finally, the role of host-defense mechanism in diabetes is important. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis are energy-dependent processes that are deficient in the diabetic. Better diabetic control with maintenance of normal blood sugars and avoidance of ketoacidosis may be the key to prevention of these morbid, lower extremity infections.",

Included in this report is a review and analysis of a 22-year experience in the vascular trauma literature with missile injuries resulting in cardioarterial or arterioarterial embolization. In-depth analysis of this collective literature review revealed small weapon caliber (79%), usually .22. Soft tissue tamponade at the injury site in the form of mediastinal hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma, or hemopericardium preventing exsanguination occurred in 37% of cases. Cardiac and thoracic aortic entry sites represented 70% of the series with distinct patterns of peripheral vascular embolization found resulting from anatomic relationships and laminar flow. Diagnostic evaluation by means of remote x-ray screening documented 86% of the emboli and was supplemented with arteriographic studies in 36%. Direct transverse arteriotomy overlying the projectile was favored; most of the delayed embolectomies stemmed from a failure to recognize those patients with peripheral embolization and a compensated asymptomatic limb. An appropriate management plan and diagnostic algorithm for this rare vascular phenomenon have been generated by this study.",

A duplex scan was also performed 2 years postoperatively in 75 cases. Moreover, the state of the endarterectomized carotid bifurcations was documented by intravenous digital subtraction angiography during hospitalization and at 12 months. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after operation the rate of significant recurrent stenosis was 6%, 12%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. Approximately half of the arteries with a significant stenosis at 1 year already demonstrated this lesion with intravenous digital subtraction angiography performed 1 week after operation. Persistent significant recurrent stenosis in the remaining arteries was probably the result of excessive myointimal proliferation. This occurred with a higher frequency in women (14.8%) than in men (4.1%). The greater number of the arteries with minimally or mildly disturbed spectral waveforms 3 months after endarterectomy spontaneously normalized or remained stable during the follow-up period. On the other hand, 40% of the arteries with a significant stenosis (diameter reduction of 50% or more) at the three-month control follow-up period increased to a more severe degree of stenosis during the first postoperative year. Most of the operated arteries did not significantly change during the second year.",

The first 82 patients had primary closure of the arteriotomy, whereas the subsequent 70 patients underwent closure with Dacron patch angioplasty. Duplex scanning was undertaken postoperatively in 102 of these patients with a mean follow-up period of 17 months. Perioperative thrombosis occurred in two patients (1.3%), late postoperative recurrent stenosis in 14 patients (13.7%), and late postoperative occlusion in three patients (2.9%). Of the various factors investigated for their correlation with late recurrent stenosis or occlusion, only three were significant: the female sex (recurrent stenosis in 29% vs. 8%, p less than 0.05), a small (less than 4 mm) internal carotid artery (37% vs. 12%, p less than 0.05), and failure to close the arteriotomy with a patch (29% vs. 6%, p less than 0.05). The development of recurrent carotid lesions appeared independent of smoking history, antiplatelet therapy, use of a shunt, or extent of carotid plaque. These data suggest that patients with small internal carotid arteries, specifically female patients, are at greater risk for recurrent carotid stenosis. Patch angioplasty may decrease this risk and should be considered in these patients.",

The frequency of complications in our series is high compared with that found in a survey of 13 studies with 2043 patients. The most marked discrepancy was our high frequency of septic symptoms. A mortality rate of 2.2% was also higher in our series, but we have consequently registered the 30-day mortality rate to make comparisons with surgical series relevant. Radiologic alterations are usually not reported in other series probably because they are regarded as a part of the method, but we consider these alterations as potentially dangerous and important to report because they can result in clinically relevant complications. Because of the complications PTA should only be performed in centers in which complications can be optimally treated.",

    "abstract": "Patients with heparin-induced platelet activation who are reexposed to heparin may have recurrent thrombocytopenia, intravascular thrombosis, arterial emboli, or sudden death. To permit carotid endarterectomy in two patients with confirmed heparin-induced platelet activation, we compared the efficacies of aspirin and iloprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin, in preventing heparin-induced platelet activation. In the first patient, although aspirin prevented both in vitro heparin-induced platelet aggregation (70% without and 7.5% with aspirin) and 14C serotonin release (48% without and 0% with aspirin), intraoperative administration of heparin resulted in an increase in plasma levels of platelet factor 4 from 8 to 260 ng/ml and beta-thromboglobulin levels from 29 to 39 ng/ml. In addition, the circulating platelet count decreased from 221,000 to 174,000 microliters, and 15% spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed. Fortunately, fibrinopeptide A levels remained less than 10 ng/ml intraoperatively, and no thrombotic complications occurred. In the second patient, aspirin did not prevent heparin-induced platelet aggregation in vitro (65% without and 41% with aspirin); however, iloprost (0.01 mumol/L) prevented both in vitro heparin-induced platelet aggregation (59.5% without and 0.0% with iloprost) and 14C serotonin release (56.7% without and 0.0% with iloprost). Therefore, a continuous infusion of iloprost was begun before administration of heparin and was continued until 20 minutes after reversal of heparin with protamine. After intraoperative administration of heparin, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 increased from 19 to 200 ng/ml, and beta-thromboglobulin levels increased from 56 to 76 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "One hundred forty-nine consecutive patients who had peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with clinically audible asymptomatic bruits were studied. Sixty-two of these patients were age- and sex-matched with 62 PAD patients in whom no bruits were detected. The PAD was demonstrated by angiography or by the 1-minute exercise test. Clinical assessment was performed every 6 months and oculoplethysmography and carotid phonoangiography (OPG/CPA) were performed every year. Angiography and reconstructive surgery were performed only if symptoms of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke occurred. Life-table analysis revealed that over a 5.5-year follow-up, 32% of 211 PAD patients were expected to die. In the control study 45% of bruit patients and 32% of control patients were expected to die (no significant difference). Myocardial infarction accounted for 59% of deaths in the bruit group compared with 28% in the control group (no significant difference). TIA occurred more commonly in the bruit group (26.5%) than in the controls (6%) (p less than 0.02). However, stroke without warning occurred in 9% of bruit patients compared with 8% of controls (no significant difference). It is concluded that for asymptomatic carotid bruit it is safe to wait for the onset of symptoms before angiography and corrective reconstructive surgery.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial damage after simulated angioscopic insertion was evaluated in 22 dogs by radioimmunoassay of endogenous 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (stable product of prostacyclin produced by the endothelium) by means of a closed perfusion system and scanning electron microscopy. In 20 dogs, a 1.7 mm diameter polyethylene tube similar in size and physical characteristics to a commercially available angioscope was passed once into the distal venotomy site and out of the proximal venotomy site for a total distance of 15 cm in the left saphenous vein (group A) and 10 times in both directions in the right saphenous vein, destroying all valves (group B). The vein segments were examined immediately after simulated angioscopic insertion and at intervals of 2, 3, and 4 weeks. The remaining two dogs were used as control animals to establish baseline prostacyclin production. All veins were patent when harvested. Scanning electron microscopy revealed globular and contracted endothelial cells in some areas of group A veins, whereas partial longitudinal absence of endothelial cells was noted in group B veins. Intimal coverage was complete by 2 weeks in group A veins and between 3 and 4 weeks in group B veins. Prostacyclin synthesis of group B veins was significantly less than that of group A at day 1 and at 2 weeks after operation (p less than 0.05), reaching that of control vein synthesis by 4 weeks. This study suggests that simulated angioscopic trauma of the luminal surface of the canine saphenous vein had no negative effect on early patency.",

    "abstract": "With demonstration of the failure of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass to reduce the incidence of stroke in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, controversy continues regarding the best method of stroke prevention in these high-risk persons. One approach, endarterectomy of stenotic lesions of the contralateral carotid bifurcation, has been used for 145 patients with ICA occlusion during the past 25 years. Presenting symptoms included focal transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in 62 patients, stroke (CVA) in 57, and nonfocal TIAs in 16. Ten patients were asymptomatic. Nine patients (6.2%) sustained perioperative strokes, only three of which were ipsilateral to the endarterectomy. There were three perioperative deaths (2.1%). During the follow-up period (mean 4 years) there were 13 new strokes (9.2%), four of which were fatal. These late results compare favorably with patients from the cooperative study of EC-IC bypass with occlusion of one ICA, whether they received surgical treatment or were managed nonoperatively. With the exception of select situations where an occluded ICA may be reopened, we conclude that the best current therapy for these patients is close observation of the nonoccluded ICA and endarterectomy once a stenotic lesion is encountered.",

We report 17 documented cases with long-term follow-up after diagnosis made on the basis of arteriography. Clinical findings include male sex, unilaterality, sudden onset, and severe Raynaud's phenomenon. Angiography indicated that the 17 patients had either ulnar thrombosis or ulnar aneurysm; most of them also had embolic occlusions of the digital arteries. Main pathologic findings were thrombosis on the intima and fibrosis in the media. We adopted a surgical procedure consisting of resection with end-to-end reconstruction for patent aneurysms to avoid downstream emboli and more conservative treatment when the ulnar artery was thrombosed. No patient required digital amputation and all except one improved and were able to live and work normally with only a moderate disability, consisting of Raynaud's phenomenon during the cold season only.",

    "abstract": "Revascularization of the lower extremities may require an axillofemoral bypass when an aortobifemoral bypass is contraindicated. Thirty-one patients underwent axillounifemoral and 59 had an axillobifemoral bypass, with a mortality rate of 9%. The indication for operation was limb salvage in 67%, intra-abdominal sepsis in 21%, and disabling claudication in 12%. Cumulative survival, patency, and limb salvage rates were determined by life-table analysis. The cumulative patency and limb salvage rates (with standard errors) at 3 years were 68% +/- 8% and 78% +/- 9%, respectively. When stratified for type of operation, axillobifemoral bypass had a superior patency rate compared with axillounifemoral bypass (log rank = 3.882, p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference when patients were stratified for diabetes (log rank = 2.213, p = no significance [NS]), operative indication (disabling claudication vs. limb salvage) (log rank = 0.0005, p = NS), or outflow (no profundaplasty vs. profundaplasty) (log rank = 2.011, p = NS). We conclude that axillofemoral bypass is a reasonable alternative for revascularization in high-risk patients or in those patients in whom a transabdominal approach is contraindicated. We recommend aggressive use of the profunda femoris artery when the superficial femoral artery is occluded to achieve optimal results.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative outflow resistance (OR) measurements in predicting late graft patency rates (PR) for femoropopliteal (FP) and femoroinfrapopliteal (FD) bypasses, we have reviewed 134 such cases performed during the past 3 years at our institution. Of these, 64 bypasses were FP (13 autogenous saphenous vein [ASV] and 51 polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) and 70 were FD (43 ASV and 27 PTFE). Total and distal OR measurements (measured in millimeters of mercury per milliliter per minute) were divided into four groups each for all infrainguinal bypasses combined and for FP and FD bypasses separately. The relationship of PR to total and distal OR measurements were analyzed according to the product limit method. Overall 1- and 2-year PRs were 64% and 56%, respectively. For FP bypasses the same PRs were 78% and 67% whereas for FD bypasses, they were 52% and 45%, respectively. The 1-year PRs for FP and FD bypasses within each respective OR group were analyzed. For FP bypasses in the lowest to the highest total OR groups, the 1-year PRs were 86%, 75%, 78%, and 62% (NS), and for FD bypasses they were 72%, 89%, 23%, and 22% (p less than 0.001). Similar trends were observed when distal OR measurements were analyzed. For infrainguinal PTFE bypasses, both total and distal OR measurements were significant predictors of patency, whereas for those with ASV only distal OR measurements were predictive. These data reaffirm our early experience with OR measurements. Although a trend for predicting graft patency was noted for FP bypasses, OR measurements were highly predictive only for FD bypasses.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-three patients with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease underwent angiography and CT of the aortoiliac segment within a 72-hour interval. Examinations were evaluated for depiction of disease in the aortic and iliac segments in five categories: stenosis, plaque morphology, vascular ectasia, calcification, and other pathologic conditions. Angiography and CT were equally accurate in their depiction of the degree of aortic stenosis or occlusion and in identification of aortic ectasia. Angiography proved superior to CT in the display of plaque morphology in 57% of aortic lesions and 74% of iliac abnormalities. Angiography also showed clear superiority over CT in quantification of iliac stenosis in 75% of patients with abnormalities, as well as in identification of iliac ectasia. CT detected both intimal calcification and incidental disease or congenital abnormalities better than angiography, including an unsuspected chronic contained aortic rupture. Overall, CT compared favorably with angiography in the identification of all types of aortic disease but major disadvantages of CT were evident in the iliac segment because of vessel tortuosity or heavy calcification. CT cannot replace arteriography in detecting atherosclerotic disease of the aortoiliac segment but can help to clarify angiographic findings in selected groups of patients.",

    "abstract": "Although compression stockings have long been recognized as a physiologically significant tool for the promotion of venous return from the lower extremity, the role of nonprescription, commercially available support hose has not been assessed in this regard. The present study involved 100 consecutive women with no known prior history of vascular disease, who responded to an advertisement for free evaluation of the venous status of their legs. The subjects, all of whom wore commercial support hose routinely, were screened for the presence of venous disease by means of Doppler ultrasonography, phleborheography, and a detailed history focusing on risk factors and unrecognized symptoms of venous disease. Photoplethysmography (PPG) was then used to evaluate the efficiency of venous return from the lower extremity with and without the support hose in place. Worsening of PPG results occurred in 43% of the women with commercial stockings in place, whereas 23% improved and 34% showed no change. Women 50 years of age and older had a somewhat higher tendency toward poorer PPG results while wearing the support hose. Furthermore, measurements in women who showed evidence of venous disease by an abnormality in one or more of the screening tests were significantly different from the overall group (p = 0.025): 61% exhibited worsening of PPG results when wearing stockings, only 14% showed improvement, and 25% were unchanged. These results suggest that the use of a commercial support hose may be particularly deleterious to older women and is contraindicated in those with evidence of venous disease in the lower extremity.",

    "abstract": "Prediction and localization of significant proximal occlusive disease in the lower extremities, whether in isolation or in combination with significant distal disease, still represent major problems to the noninvasive vascular laboratory. Power frequency spectrum analysis (PFSA) was done on continuous-wave Doppler signals in the common femoral artery of 86 limbs in 50 patients before and after postocclusive reactive hyperemia testing in an effort to differentiate hemodynamically significant from insignificant proximal occlusive disease, whether in isolation or in combination with hemodynamically significant distal disease. Limbs were assigned to four different categories according to their angiographic findings. With the use of a bandwidth at 50% peak amplitude (f50%) of 2000 Hz as the cut-off point between a positive and a negative examination, the test was 93% sensitive, 90% specific, and 92% accurate in distinguishing hemodynamically significant proximal lesions from hemodynamically insignificant lesions, regardless of distal disease. In addition, there exists a small group with significant disease at or close to the site of Doppler sampling, which produces f50% values of more than 3000 Hz. Diagnosis in this subgroup was much like that in carotid disorders. Finally, the predictive accuracy of standard noninvasive Doppler/segmental pressure measurement was compared with results of PFSA. In most patients, standard measurements were comparable; however, in the subgroup with hemodynamically significant proximal and distal disease, the PFSA technique accurately predicted hemodynamically significant proximal diseases in 93% of patients, where combined pressure/Doppler testing had an accuracy of only 61%. In all, spectrum analysis of common femoral artery velocity signals can greatly aid in determining the presence or absence of significant proximal disease in all situations.",

    "abstract": "The 1-month prognosis of 91 limbs with a pulseless foot in 49 patients was determined and related to elements of the physical examination, including Doppler ultrasonography. The risk factors that could predict loss of limb and death in this group of patients were determined. Gangrene and atrophy coupled with absent ultrasound signals predicted a 75% risk of loss of limb; this occurred despite attempted surgical intervention. Absence of Doppler signals in both ankle arteries was the strongest risk factor for predicting death. This is probably because ultrasound signals are absent only when arterial disease is far advanced. We conclude that Doppler ultrasound examination of the pulseless foot yields useful prognostic information relative to the fate of the limb and the patient who possesses such a limb.",

    "abstract": "A study was designed to compare platelet deposition between knitted and woven Dacron grafts in the same patient. Twenty patients received aortoiliac or aortofemoral bifurcated Dacron grafts, each composed of one woven and one double-velour knitted limb. External nuclear graft imaging was carried out after injection of autologous platelets labeled with indium 111. The patients were studied postoperatively in time periods ranging from 6 days to 42 months. Platelet accumulation was almost identical in knitted and woven limbs in all patients. This study appears to indicate that there is no difference in thrombogenicity between knitted and woven bifurcated Dacron grafts in the aortoiliac or aortofemoral positions measured by platelet accumulation.",

    "abstract": "A venous embolism model with autogenous thrombus was used for comparison of the functional properties of two new vena caval devices: a titanium Greenfield filter and the bird's nest filter. All nine Greenfield filters were correctly placed in the inferior vena cava and produced significant clot lysis of 81.3% +/- 16.3% (p less than 0.001, paired t test). Difficulty was encountered in affixing the hooks of the bird's nest device into the vein wall and resulted in two filters not being inserted and two filters being placed too proximally. One set of hooked wires of another bird's nest device migrated to the right atrium despite correct insertion. Eight bird's nest devices allowed clot lysis of 83.4% +/- 17.7% (p less than 0.001), paired t test) but thrombus size was increased in one case. The Greenfield and bird's nest filters have comparable effects on trapped emboli, but the bird's nest filter may be susceptible to thrombosis and occlusion under certain circumstances. The pre-shaped hooked wires of the bird's nest device may be difficult to insert and may allow proximal migration after a large thrombus was trapped.",

    "abstract": "A preliminary basic study of argon laser angioplasty with the use of a specially designed probe is presented. Arterial specimens were harvested from 10 amputated lower extremities. The studies included the evaluation of coaxial laser angioplasty in 10 partially or totally occluded arteries; the observation of the effect of perpendicularly applied laser energy on 35 thrombi, 54 soft and 10 hard atherosclerotic, and 51 normal arterial walls; the comparison of laser energy requirements for coaxial vessel lumen enlargement or recanalization vs. perpendicular penetration in 10 occluded, hard atherosclerotic arteries; and the spectrographic analysis of calcium density gradient in two specimens. The results showed that the power required for vessel lumen enlargement was 10 +/- 6 J/mm of atherosclerotic vessel (mean +/- standard deviation). The probe followed the original arterial lumen, did not perforate the vessel wall, and created a smooth, enlarged path. The power required to penetrate perpendicularly to a similar depth for thrombi, soft and hard atherosclerotic plaques, and normal arterial walls was 15 +/- 4, 30 +/- 15, 65 +/- 32, and 246 +/- 123 J/mm, respectively. In the hard calcified specimens, laser energy required for coaxial lumen enlargement or recanalization was significantly less than that for perpendicular penetration (p less than 0.05), which correlated with the calcium density map indicating an increase from inside to outside.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to assess the efficacy of thrombolytic infusions for arterial ischemia, a questionnaire was distributed to 142 vascular surgeons. Data from 45 respondents who had experience with thrombolytic infusion in 623 patients were reviewed. A successful outcome was obtained in 313 of 623 patients (50.2%). Morbidity was significant, with hemorrhage requiring transfusion or operation in 125 cases (20.1%) and major amputation in 103 cases (16.5%). There were nine strokes associated with thrombolytic infusion (1.4%), six of which were fatal. Sixteen deaths were associated with thrombolytic therapy, for a mortality rate of 2.5% (16 of 623 patients). Analysis of results by grouping centers according to numbers of lytic infusions failed to show significant correlation with center experience. Furthermore, morbidity and mortality were seen in centers with both limited and extensive experience with thrombolytic infusion. The initial enthusiasm for thrombolytic infusion to treat arterial ischemia is not substantiated by our data. Carefully controlled prospective trials are needed before this method can be offered as an alternative to arterial reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The hemodynamic consequences of six current types of surgically constructed arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in the human arm are studied with the use of the model of a stationary electric resistance circuit. Variations in arterial and venous resistances and in anastomosis techniques are considered. With this model all possible AVFs can be compared in terms of risk (loss of distal perfusion pressure) and benefit (volume of fistula flow). According to our model the most efficient type of fistula is the end-to-end AVF at the wrist. In patients with abnormally high resistance of the arm arteries this fistula is inadequate for efficient hemodialysis treatment. To reduce the incidence of finger ischemia in more proximal AVFs our model indicates that the arterial anastomosis should be as proximal as possible and/or hemodynamically nonsmooth (i.e., side-to-side).",

    "abstract": "The in vitro reactivity of vein bypass grafts to norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was studied in 20 rabbits undergoing bypass grafting. In these animals the right external jugular vein was grafted into the right carotid artery. The cumulative dose-response to NE and 5-HT of rings of vein grafts 2, 4, and 6 weeks after insertion was compared with that of rings from the normal contralateral jugular vein by means of an organ bath to measure changes in isometric tension. With NE there was no significant difference in the response of vein grafts harvested at 2 weeks and control veins. However, at 4 and 6 weeks there was a progressive decrease in the sensitivity of the grafts to NE. The difference in ED50 values (ED50 defined as concentration of agonist required to elicit 50% of the maximal response) between control veins and vein grafts at 4 weeks was twofold and at 6 weeks it was fivefold. None of the control veins responded to 5-HT stimulation. However, the vein grafts contracted with 5-HT, exhibiting sigmoid dose-response curves. The vein grafts showed intimal hyperplasia, which was maximal after 4 weeks. These results show that vein grafts undergo a progressive decrease in their sensitivity to norepinephrine and develop a marked, sustained increase in sensitivity to 5-HT. This finding is in contrast to previous observations in intimal hyperplastic rabbit aorta, suggesting a fundamental difference in the functional expression of arterial and venous intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The use of computed tomography (CT) in the management of patients who are hemodynamically stable with symptoms suggestive of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and in hemodynamically unstable patients without palpable or known aortic aneurysms was analyzed in a retrospective study. One hundred forty-two CT scans were performed; 48 patients had abdominal aortic aneurysms and 35 had no evidence of rupture or retroperitoneal blood. Ten patients had CT scans that showed evidence of rupture, and three patients had CT scans that were thought to be indeterminate for rupture, probably inflammatory. Forty patients underwent laparotomy. Excluding the three patients with inflammatory aneurysms, the results of CT scanning were compared with the findings at laparotomy. The sensitivity of CT scanning for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal blood in the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm was 77% and the specificity was 100%, with an overall accuracy of 92%. An algorithm for the management of the patient with symptoms suggestive of a ruptured aneurysm is presented.",

    "abstract": "From April 1981 to April 1985, 128 limbs in 120 patients who had primary femoropopliteal bypasses were entered in a randomized comparative study. Grafts used were 56 randomized and five obligatory reversed saphenous veins (RSVs), 41 randomized and 24 obligatory superficial femoral-popliteal veins (SF-PVs), and two obligatory prosthetic grafts. The primary patency rates of randomized SF-PVs (64% at 3 years) and RSVs (60% at 3 years) were not significantly different. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the secondary patency rates of 68% for SF-PVs and 63% for RSVs at 3 years. Combinations of obesity, hypertension, and poor medical condition mandated obligatory RSV use. Obligatory SF-PV use was necessitated by absence (eight cases) or inadequacy (16 cases) of the saphenous vein. Indications for bypass were critical ischemia (RSVs, 93% and SF-PVs, 92%) and claudication (RSVs, 7% and SF-PVs, 8%). Diabetes was present in 69% of patients with SF-PV bypass and 49% of those with RSV bypass. Limb retention, operative mortality, and patient survival rates were not significantly different with each graft. Continuation of the study as originally structured, with nonselective SF-PV use, became ethically untenable when it was appreciated that results in black patients and patients with excessively large grafts were markedly inferior and that construction of 3 cm moderately tapered anastomoses significantly reduced the incidence of distal anastomotic hyperplasia. These results, obtained during a period when important lessons about SF-PV use were being learned, indicate that during the first three years of observation after primary femoropopliteal bypass, the differences in cumulative primary and secondary patency rates of SF-PVs and RSVs were not statistically significant. Results in the most recent 76 SF-PV grafts, with primary and secondary patency rates of 82% and 89% at 3 years, provide a more realistic picture of the effectiveness of SF-PVs as primary femoropopliteal bypass grafts.",

This case report illustrates the need for prompt diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention. The most common organisms found with these aneurysms have been Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. We report a case of a mycotic internal carotid artery aneurysm resulting from Salmonella enteritidis. A 20-year review of both the foreign and English language literature revealed only one other case of a mycotic carotid aneurysm resulting from Salmonella infection. The cornerstone of therapy in the past had been proximal ligation. More recently, primary reconstructive procedures with either an end-to-end anastomosis or an interposition vein graft have been described. The present case was managed with an end-to-end technique with the use of a Pruitt-Inahara shunt.",

Sixty-six patients underwent IV-DSA as well as CT during a 2-year period. Sixty-four of the 66 patients underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The results of the 66 patients were analyzed to assess what additional information was obtained by IV-DSA concerning aneurysm size, vascular anomalies, visceral arterial anatomy, associated aneurysmal disease, and iliofemoral and distal occlusive disease.

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience with femorofemoral bypass during the past 10 years to define its role relative to other methods in the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. The cumulative patency rate for 82 patients was 80% +/- 5% at 1 year and 67% +/- 7% at 2 and 3 years. The operation was most likely to be successful if the indication was claudication (p less than 0.05) and if the operation was performed as the primary procedure (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference when patients with or without profundaplasty were compared. It is concluded that femorofemoral bypass is indicated to treat symptomatic unilateral iliac disease when transluminal dilatation is not possible. Femorofemoral bypass is also the procedure of choice for aortofemoral graft occlusion when the thrombosed limb cannot be reopened. Femorofemoral bypass is recommended for both high- and low-risk patients when indicated.",

    "abstract": "Autologous endothelial seeding (AES) of vascular prostheses in dogs increases thrombus-free surface and improves prosthetic prostacyclin production, patency, and the ability to withstand hematogenous challenge with bacteria. No such information is available in human subjects. In the present study one limb of an aortic Dacron bifurcation prosthesis was seeded with autologous endothelial cells (ECs) harvested from the distal portion of the saphenous vein by enzymatic treatment. The deposition of indium 111-labeled platelets on the vascular prostheses was studied 1 and 4 months after operation. In seven of nine patients seeding resulted in decreased accumulation of radiolabeled platelets compared with sham-seeded control limbs (p less than 0.04), when studied 1 month after surgery. A decrease in platelet accumulation occurred over the whole prosthesis between 1 and 4 months, and no significant difference was noted at 4 months between seeded and nonseeded graft limbs. Although the seeding density was very low (440 ECs/cm2), the observed difference in platelet accumulation for AES-treated graft limbs in the early postoperative course merits further investigation of this technique in human beings.",

    "abstract": "From 1965 to 1985, 19 patients with a single, ischemic kidney underwent renal revascularization. Thirteen patients had a single kidney and six had a single functioning kidney. The cause of the renal artery lesions was atherosclerosis in 17 patients and fibromuscular dysplasia in two. All but one were hypertensive with a mean diastolic blood pressure of 119 mm Hg and they were taking an average of 2.6 antihypertensive medications. Most had diminished renal function with a mean serum creatinine value of 3.7 mg/dl (range 0.8 to 9.0 mg/dl) and a mean creatinine clearance of 38 ml/min (range 8 to 75 ml/min). Three patients required preoperative hemodialysis. The first two patients treated died postoperatively, but no deaths have occurred since 1970. Follow-up among the survivors averaged 32.9 months. The mean serum creatinine value decreased significantly to 2.2 mg/dl postoperatively (p less than 0.04); the mean diastolic pressure decreased significantly to 86 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). One patient was normotensive preoperatively. Of the 16 patients surviving operation, 14 had improvement of their hypertension, one was cured, and only one did not benefit. No patient's hypertension was worse. The mean number of postoperative antihypertensive medications decreased significantly to 1.5 medications per patient (p less than 0.02). These data suggest that an aggressive surgical approach is warranted in patients with a single ischemic kidney in need of revascularization because of the gratifying response both in control of hypertension and improvement of renal function.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the assessment of thoracic outlet compression syndrome (TOS) by objective methods, we prospectively studied a group of 80 consecutive patients with disabling TOS who had been selected for surgical therapy. Comprehensive pre- and postoperative neurophysiologic tests were used and included electromyography, nerve conduction times, F wave determination, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) of median and ulnar nerves in neutral and stressed positions. Measurements were made of Erb's point peak (N9), cervical peak (P/N13), and cortical complex (N18-P22). Amplitude ratios were calculated for each side, and interpeak latencies were measured for N9-P/N13, P/N13-N18, and N9-N18. SEP results were abnormal on the affected side in 59 of 80 patients (74%); ulnar peak amplitudes were either less than 33% of median, reduced by more than 50% in the stressed position, or reduced by more than 50% when compared with the contralateral side. Of 64 patients studied pre- and postoperatively with SEP, 40 of 47 abnormal tests showed improvement, with 30 of these returning to normal values in the early postoperative period. Excellent clinical correlation was evident in 43 of these 47 patients (92%) who had pre- and postoperative tests; with relief of symptoms reflected in improved SEP, or continued symptoms explained by evidence of persistent or residual nerve dysfunction. The present methodology and criteria for test interpretation demonstrate that SEP can document the neurocompressive component of TOS and provide an objective assessment of pre- and postoperative clinical observations.",

    "abstract": "To determine which clinical and radiographic findings are valuable in selecting patients with blunt chest trauma for aortography, we analyzed the medical records and admission chest radiographs of 76 consecutive victims of blunt chest trauma with suspected thoracic aortic rupture during the past 7 years. All patients were evaluated by history, physical examination, chest radiography, and aortography; a total of 70 clinical and radiographic findings were independently assessed in each patient. The following occurred with significantly greater frequency in patients with thoracic aortic rupture than in those without: history of significant hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg) (p less than 0.04); the presence of upper extremity hypertension, bilateral lower extremity pulse pulse deficits, or an initial chest tube output greater than 750 ml of blood (p less than 0.05); and greater incidence of myocardial contusions, intra-abdominal injuries, and pelvic fractures compared with patients without thoracic aortic rupture (p less than 0.05). Mediastinal widening (equal to or greater than 8 cm) shown on anteroposterior chest radiography occurred in all patients with thoracic aortic rupture; however, its specificity was only 10.6%. Radiographic signs that were helpful in indicating the presence of thoracic aortic rupture included paratracheal stripe greater than 5 mm, rightward deviation of the nasogastric tube or central venous pressure line, blurring of the aortic knob, and an abnormal or absent paraspinous stripe. Upper rib fractures and mediastinal to thoracic cage width ratios at any level did not increase diagnostic accuracy for thoracic aortic rupture in the present series. Six patients in the series died, two of whom had thoracic aortic rupture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Nine hundred twelve patients received continuous epidural analgesia administered through an indwelling plastic catheter while undergoing vascular reconstruction of a lower extremity. During a portion of the operative event, the patients were totally, transiently anticoagulated with heparin. None of the patients had an untoward neurologic event that could be attributed to an epidural hematoma. Our results and those of others show that this form of regional analgesia is safe and far outweighs theoretic contraindications when anticoagulation with heparin is planned as a part of the operative event. In the patients with impaired pulmonary ventilation or a cardiac disorder, this method of analgesia offers many advantages over a general anesthetic, such as obviating aspiration pneumonitis and averting prolonged support in the recovery period after completion of the surgical procedure. The regional vasodilation ensuing from the epidural blockade is an additional advantage in patients undergoing vascular reconstruction for lower extremity ischemia.",

For 50 patients, the cumulative patency rate was 96% +/- 3% at 1 year and 92% +/- 5% at 2 and 3 years. The operation was most likely to be successful if the indication was claudication (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference when patients with or without profundaplasty were compared. It is concluded that iliofemoral bypass is a durable operation and indicated when transluminal dilatation is not possible and the common iliac artery is suitable as a source of inflow. When indicated, the procedure can be carried out safely for both high- and low-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Eighty-nine patients who underwent reoperation because of hemorrhagic complications after peripheral arterial surgery were studied and compared with 103 patients without such complications. Elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum creatinine values, and blood pressure before anesthesia was found more often in patients with hemorrhage. The frequency of reoperation due to control hemorrhage was 2.8%; femorodistal and carotid reconstructions were complicated by hemorrhage requiring reoperation significantly more often than other types of vascular surgery, 3.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The use of vacuum drains apparently did not contribute to the diagnosis of bleeding requiring reoperation. Amputation was a more frequent outcome in femorodistal reconstructions complicated by hemorrhage than in similar operations without this complication. After reoperations performed within 48 hours of the primary operation, the clinical course mostly was uncomplicated, whereas in reoperations performed later the bleeding usually was associated with infection of the reconstruction, resulting in a higher frequency of amputation. Most of the late hemorrhages occurred in groin incisions.",

    "abstract": "Kinked extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries are observed in 10% to 16% of cerebral angiograms. The hemodynamic significance of some kinked carotid arteries has been shown by investigators who documented oculoplethysmographic and angiographic differences accompanying flexion, extension, or rotation changes of the neck and head. In the 3-year period ending November 1985, we performed operations on seven patients to correct six kinked internal carotid arteries and one kinked vertebral artery at the C-2 level. The final decision regarding optimal operative technique was determined during operation, after observing the relative lengths of dissected arteries, envisioning the results of the procedures selected. We performed five segmental resections and end-to-end anastomoses (one vertebral, two common carotid, and two internal carotid arteries). Transection of the internal carotid artery with reimplantation into the side of the common carotid artery was performed twice. All patients became asymptomatic up to 4 years, irrespective of head and neck positions. There were no complications or deaths in these patients. This experience suggests that arterial kinks may constitute tenable indications for operative treatment in patients with transient cerebral ischemia who lack typical stenotic or ulcerative plaques to account for their symptoms. Kinked arteries can be corrected safely and effectively by appropriate surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "At St. Vincent Hospital, Indianapolis, 17 patients have undergone femoropopliteal bypass operations with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts that were seeded with enzymatically harvested, autogenous endothelium. Three patients received seeded grafts because satisfactory veins were not available. Twenty-eight patients alternately received seeded or unseeded, externally supported e-PTFE grafts. Graft patency was evaluated by clinical criteria and changes in the Doppler ankle-brachial systolic pressure ratios at 2 and 30 days postoperatively and at 3-month intervals thereafter. Occlusions were defined arteriographically if the clinical situation or the Doppler findings deteriorated. Smoking histories were taken, and carboxyhemoglobin (COHgb) levels were sampled 1 month postoperatively. Cumulative patency after 3 months was 93.3% +/- 6.5% for seeded and 84.0% +/- 10.4% for unseeded grafts. After 1 year it was 81.6% +/- 12.3% for seeded grafts and 30.8% +/- 18.7% for unseeded grafts (p = 0.02). Thus far all but one of the occlusions have occurred in patients with a history of smoking or with a COHgb level greater than 1.5%, whereas all of the seeded grafts in nonsmokers with COHgb levels less than or equal to 1.5% are patent. We conclude that endothelial seeding of PTFE femoropopliteal grafts is feasible. During this preliminary study period, a small number of patients had favorable patency rates with seeded as compared with unseeded grafts, especially among smokers. A multiple-institution study will be needed to establish the role of endothelial cell seeding in the treatment of vascular occlusions of the femoral and popliteal arteries.",

    "abstract": "Complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) may result in a variety of clinical states. Neurologic symptoms in the setting of ICA occlusion may be due to embolic events through the external carotid artery (ECA) circulation, hemodynamic insufficiency resulting from inadequate collateral development, or propagation of clot intracranially. External carotid reconstruction has been used to prevent neurologic events from the first two mechanisms. This review attempts to place in perspective the current indications for, techniques of, and results from ECA revascularization. A discussion of the cerebral collateral circulation is included for reference. Twenty-three series were collected from the literature. Cases were excluded in which procedures other than ECA reconstruction were undertaken, leaving 218 cases for analysis. These represented 195 EC endarterectomies and 23 ECA bypasses. Resolution of symptoms was seen in 83% of patients with another 7% showing marked improvement. The perioperative mortality rate was 3%; neurologic deaths accounted for most perioperative deaths. The overall neurologic complication rate was 5%. More recent reports were notable for improved mortality and morbidity. A diseased contralateral carotid artery was associated with higher neurologic morbidity whereas disease in the vertebral arteries had no impact on outcome. The best results were obtained when surgery was performed to relieve specific hemispheric or retinal symptoms as opposed to nonspecific neurologic complaints or previous stroke. The symptomatic patient with ICA occlusion has a poor neurologic prognosis. In selected circumstances ECA reconstruction should be considered among the treatment options in this clinical setting.",

Eighty-five GSVs were successfully used for infrainguinal revascularization; duplex scanning correctly identified 82 of these GSVs as being acceptable for use in in situ bypass. Seventeen GSVs were unacceptable for in situ bypass; duplex scanning correctly identified 11 of these as being unacceptable. Duplex scanning provides anatomic information about the GSV, including size, patency, course, varicosities, double segments, and tributaries.

    "abstract": "The management of an acutely ischemic extremity requires knowledge of the response of skeletal muscle (the largest component of the lower limb) to prolonged periods of complete normothermic ischemia. We have used the canine gracilis muscle model to evaluate the extent and distribution of ischemic necrosis after 3 and 5 hours of ischemia and 48 hours of reperfusion. Each muscle was cut into six slices, and the extent and distribution of postischemic necrosis identified by means of nitroblue tetrazolium staining and 99mTc pyrophosphate uptake. After 3, 4, and 5 hours of ischemia the extent of necrosis was 2.0% +/- 0.9%, 30.3% +/- 6.0%, and 90.1% +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SEM), respectively. A statistically significant correlation exists between the extent of necrosis and the uptake of 99mTc pyrophosphate uptake per gram of tissue (y = 1574.9x - 8.4, r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). Most necrosis was centrally located and found in the thickest portion of the muscle. We conclude that there is a graded response in the extent of skeletal muscle necrosis related to the length of ischemic stress rather than an \"all-or-none\" phenomenon. This central distribution of necrosis makes the usual external evaluation of ischemic damage clinically unreliable. In addition, since there was no enveloping fascia in this model, a compartment release alone may not prevent the development of skeletal muscle necrosis. This knowledge of the response of skeletal muscle to ischemia may lead to an improved clinical approach to an extremity suffering a prolonged ischemic insult.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the reproducibility of noninvasive vascular laboratory measurements for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and compares their variability to other clinical measurements, including pulse rate, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. To study the reproducibility of these measurements, we considered three components that affect the repeatability; the variation associated with the measurement process, the variation associated with transient changing characteristics of the patients with time, and the variation among the patients. It is useful to consider the variation of each component relative to the variation among the patients, measured in units of standard deviation. The variation associated with the measurement process (expressed as the relative precision) was determined by repeating the measurements in pairs at random times throughout the study period. The relative precision was 0.3% for the measurements of ankle-arm systolic blood pressure ratio and treadmill walking time, 2.7% for pulsatility index, and 1.2% to 4.2% for the other clinical, hematologic, and biochemical measurements. The temporal variations were determined by repeating the measurements over a 6-week period in 15 patients. The normalized long-term fluctuation was 1.7% for ankle-arm systolic pressure ratio, 3.2% for treadmill walking time, 7.5% for pulsatility index, and 1.3% to 5.5% for the other measurements. For each test, the 95% confidence interval for an individual patient's measurements and the values above which the difference between two successive measurements can be considered significantly different (95%) have been calculated. It is concluded that the reproducibility of standard vascular laboratory measurements compares favorably to the other clinical, hematologic, and biochemical measurements evaluated in this study.",

    "abstract": "The methods used in management of 102 femoral anastomotic aneurysms (FAAs) were analyzed, and a case control study was performed in an effort to define potential etiologic factors. Most FAAs resulted from host vessel degeneration, although broken sutures, infection, and prosthetic graft dilatation contributed in some cases. Patients forming FAAs after aortofemoral bypass more often were hypertensive, had progression of distal disease, and showed diffuse atherosclerosis when compared with control patients. The use of braided synthetic sutures, woven Dacron grafts, and concomitant femoral endarterectomy correlated with FAA development, whereas diabetes mellitus, multiple femoral operations, local wound-healing problems, and occlusion of the superficial femoral artery did not correlate with the formation of FAAs. Ninety FAAs (88%) were treated surgically with an operative mortality rate of 3%. The most common surgical technique was aneurysmectomy with interposition prosthetic graft replacement. Durability of the repair was better if a simultaneous outflow procedure was performed and if the reconstruction was done before complications developed. Complicated FAAs are still responsible for significant morbidity and loss of life despite aggressive surgical management. Elective FAA repair is the preferred method of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Thirty-nine infrainguinal bypass grafts with multiple sequential distal anastomoses were performed on 35 patients ranging in age from 32 to 79 years (mean 65.8 years) with severe femoropopliteal occlusive disease. Thirty-eight procedures were performed for limb salvage indications. Distal anastomoses were performed to the popliteal-anterior tibial arteries in seven procedures, the popliteal-posterior tibial arteries in six, the popliteal-peroneal arteries in six, the anterior tibial-peroneal arteries in eight, the posterior tibial-peroneal arteries in 10, and the posterior tibial-anterior tibial arteries in two. Saphenous vein was the graft material in 31 procedures (in situ in two), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in four, and saphenous vein-PTFE composite in four. The mean Doppler ankle-arm index was 0.38 +/- 0.14 preoperatively and 0.89 +/- 0.13 postoperatively. The early (30-day) graft patency rate was 93%. With life-table analysis, the long-term primary patency rate was 70% at 1 year, 61% at 3 years, and 52% at 7 years for saphenous vein grafts; the secondary patency rate was 65% at 7 years for saphenous vein grafts. The secondary patency rate for PTFE and PTFE-vein composite grafts was 75% at 1 year, 50% at 3 years, and 17% at 5 years. Cumulative life-table limb salvage rates were 91% at 1 year, 85% at 5 years, and 61% at 7 years. The multiple sequential distal bypass graft is durable and highly efficacious in achieving limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "To provide sequential, quantitative analysis of the cellular events occurring in reversed autogenous vein grafts after implantation and potential modifications of these events, two groups of veins were evaluated. Veins prepared by standard techniques of unmonitored pressure distension with cold heparinized saline solution, tributary ligation adjacent to the wall, and storage at 4 degrees C were morphometrically compared with veins harvested by means of a modified protocol of papaverine irrigation, tributary ligation away from the graft wall, pressure distension to 100 mm Hg with heparinized blood containing papaverine at body temperature, storage in identical solution at 4 degrees C, and implantation while distended. Unilateral jugular veins harvested from dogs with the modified technique (IRJV,N = 9) or standard technique (SRJV,N = 9) were implanted into carotid arteries, retrieved at 30 minutes, 2 days, and 10 days postoperatively along with the contralateral control vein after perfusion fixation in situ, and examined microscopically to quantitate intimal-medial thickness and endothelial damage (denudation and ultrastructural alterations). All IRJVs remained endothelialized, whereas SRJVs had 19% and 40% endothelial denudation at 30 minutes and 2 days, respectively, as well as massive neutrophil, platelet, and monocyte involvement. In contrast, IRJVs had only a modest infiltration of monocytes beginning early after implantation and culminating in their localization beneath endothelial cells; these endothelial cells increased in number during the 10-day period. Although SRJVs exhibited nearly complete reendothelialization over the luminal surface of macrophages by 10 days, endothelial damage was consistently higher than that of IRJVs at all periods and intimal-medial thickness was significantly greater at 10 days (65 +/- 0 vs. 57 +/- 0 micron, respectively; p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that endothelial preservation with improved harvesting techniques inhibits thrombosis and limits wall thickening and also that macrophages may play a protective role by promoting endothelial proliferation.",

    "abstract": "During the past 13 years, 16 patients with visual disturbances, ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, and external carotid artery (ECA) stenosis have had ECA reconstruction. Indications for operation included amaurosis fugax (AF) in five patients, AF and transient ischemic attacks in four patients, ischemic optic neuropathy in two patients, retinal artery occlusion in one patient, and blurry vision and scotomata in four patients. In 12 cases (75%), there were hemodynamically significant contralateral ICA lesions, including four contralateral ICA occlusions. EC endarterectomies were performed in 15 patients, whereas one patient was treated with a bypass graft. One transient neurologic event occurred in the perioperative period (6%). There were no deaths nor permanent neurologic deficits. Patients were followed up for periods of 1 to 60 months (mean 18.4 months). Two patients had AF postoperatively; in one instance, AF was associated with ECA thrombosis 53 months after operation. One patient had a transient ischemic attack when the ECA thrombosed 24 months after operation. This study demonstrates that visual symptoms can occur despite ipsilateral ICA occlusion. ECA revascularization is effective and can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Saphenous vein resistance influences graft flow rates and may affect graft patency in lower limb revascularization. To quantitate specifically the contribution of saphenous vein valves to this resistance, 10 human saphenous veins (mean length 68 cm, diameter 0.42 mm, and 5.2 valves per vein) were perfused with water under carefully controlled pressure gradients designed to simulate different peripheral resistances in the outflow bed. The Reynolds number was maintained at 350 to 600, within the physiologic range for in vivo grafts. Veins were perfused under both venous (10 mm Hg) and arterial (100 mm Hg) mean pressures to determine the effects of distension on the overall resistance of the conduit. The valves were bisected according to Leather's techniques and flow was measured in both directions, antegrade (simulating \"reversed\" grafts) and retrograde (simulating \"in situ\" grafts). Data (mean +/- standard error) were normalized to the baseline flow for each vein with intact valves and expressed as a percentage change. Data were analyzed by means of Student's t test (p less than 0.05). Baseline antegrade flow with intact valves averaged 71.0 +/- 3.0 ml/min at pressure gradients (delta P) of 10 mm Hg and 95.0 +/- 2.6 ml/min for delta P = 20 mm Hg. After valve incision, antegrade flow (reversed) increased an average of 29% at both pressure gradients. Retrograde flow (in situ) through the bisected valves was only 19% greater than baseline antegrade flow and was significantly less than antegrade flow through bisected valves. The difference is explained by theoretic considerations of stenosis area and orifice shape. The increases in flow did not correlate with vein length or diameter, nor did flow change with different distension pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "A 34-year-old man had a posttraumatic, pelvic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and false aneurysm of 18 years' duration. He had undergone four previous unsuccessful attempts at operative repair, the last of which almost resulted in exsanguination. After the false aneurysm was exposed, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Core cooling (25 degrees C) allowed the perfusion flow rates to be lowered (less than 0.5 L/min/m2) while the aneurysm was opened, thereby permitting visualization and ligation of the arteriovenous communications within the aneurysm. Total circulatory arrest was not required. There were no complications and the patient was discharged on the eleventh postoperative day. Arteriography 5 months later showed complete ablation of the AVF. We believe that cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermia and reduced blood flow is a useful adjunct in the repair of complex AVFs and arteriovenous malformations. This technique avoids the use of total circulatory arrest, which increases the risks of air embolism and ischemic organ injury.",

    "abstract": "The effects of applied cyclic tensional deformation and relaxation on cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were examined. Endothelial cells from passages 3 to 9 were seeded in flexible-bottomed plates and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Endothelial cells in the experimental group (n = 6 wells per time point) were placed in a vacuum-operated stress-providing instrument that exerted an average elongation of 10% at maximum downward deflection of the culture plate bottom. The stretched endothelial cells were subjected to repeating cycles of 10 seconds elongation and 10 seconds relaxation from days 1 through 7 in culture. Endothelial cells in the control group (n = 6 wells per time point) were subjected to similar incubation conditions as the experimental group but without tensional deformation. Tritiated thymidine was added to cells 24 hours before harvesting. On days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 cells were counted and analyzed for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable tritiated thymidine incorporation. The results showed that 3 cycles/min mechanical stretching stimulated deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and endothelial cell division. We conclude that cyclic tensional deformation may stimulate endothelial cell proliferation. It is possible that naturally occurring cyclic mechanical deformation in vivo, such as the repetitive stretching and relaxation of aortic tissue by the heart, may invoke a particular pattern of synthesis and division in endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The ideal management of the patient with an asymptomatic stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery remains controversial. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (CE) done to treat asymptomatic carotid stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction by angiography) 10 years later. In 1976, 42 prophylactic CEs were performed. There were no postoperative deaths or strokes. During 10-year follow-up two strokes occurred in the operated hemisphere; one stroke was fatal and was due to an intracranial hemorrhage, whereas the other stroke was thromboembolic in origin. Two other patients suffered strokes in the contralateral hemisphere and seven patients had transient ischemic attacks in the contralateral hemisphere, which necessitated CE. The survival rate at the end of the study period by life-table analysis was 57% (mean 8.7 years). Sixteen late deaths occurred, with coronary artery-related disease the most common cause of death. This review with actual 10-year follow-up demonstrated that prophylactic CE may be performed with minimal risk, that late stroke in the operated hemisphere was negligible, and that long-term survival was similar to that of a comparable age-matched population, possibly because late deaths attributed to stroke were reduced. On the basis of long-term follow-up, CE to treat asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenoses appears to be indicated in appropriate patients.",

    "abstract": "The distal profunda femoris artery is frequently spared from atherosclerosis and can be used as a recipient vessel in the absence of a satisfactory common or superficial femoral artery. During a 15-year period 53 inflow procedures were done to the distal profunda femoris artery at a point more than 3 cm from its origin. The ankle-brachial systolic pressure index increased an average of 0.27 +/- 0.04 postoperatively. Limb salvage was achieved in 33 of 37 threatened extremities (89%) and claudication improved in 10 of 14 cases (71%). Symptomatic improvement was dependent on an open popliteal segment and a low profundapopliteal collateral index. The overall 4-year patency by life-table methods was 76%, with a patency of 100% for femoroprofunda crossover grafts, 96% for aorto- and ilioprofunda grafts but only 26% for axilloprofunda grafts. Bypass to the distal profunda femoris artery represents a viable alternative when the common and superficial femoral arteries are unsuitable for outflow, with results comparable to procedures done to a healthy common femoral artery.",

    "abstract": "Suprarenal extension of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has been reported to be present in less than 10% of patients. Its preoperative demonstration is of value in planning the aneurysm repair; however, the most appropriate radiologic method of assessment remains controversial. Although many practitioners advocate angiography, recent advances in noninvasive techniques challenge this approach. To determine the optimal method of assessment, a retrospective study of CT, ultrasonography, and angiography was undertaken in a group of 101 patients with AAA. Conventional CT was used in all patients and high-resolution CT through the region of the renal vein was used in 45 of these patients. Ultrasonography was used in 27 patients and angiography in 23. Conventional CT detected the renal artery origins in 76% of the cases--results that improved to 98% when thin-section high-resolution CT was used. These improvements in CT make the delineation of the relationship of the renal arteries to the aortic aneurysms almost as accurate as angiography at approximately half the cost. Its accuracy, safety, and cost effectiveness make CT the modality of choice in the preoperative assessment of suprarenal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has received widespread publicity as a safe, simple, and successful alternative to operation for the management of renal artery stenoses and renovascular hypertension (RVH). Although, in our institution, the primary management of RVH remains operative revascularization, with more than 750 such procedures having been done, we have had the opportunity to manage a spectrum of PTA failures in nine patients during the last 5 years. These include (1) acute dissection of atherosclerotic lesions and occlusion of the distal renal artery requiring emergency operation; (2) unilateral perforation and bilateral thrombosis of fibrodysplastic branch renal artery lesions requiring staged ex vivo reconstruction; (3) cholesterol embolization and recurrence to total occlusion of orificial atherosclerotic lesions with loss of excretory renal function; (4) chronic dissection from repeated \"temporarily successful\" PTAs of medial fibrodysplastic lesions; and (5) rapid recurrence and acceleration of hypertension in a 17-year-old girl with congenital renal artery stenoses. In each instance operation was complicated by an intense perivascular inflammatory response from the previous PTA and required a more complex reconstruction than would have been needed originally. These sequelae argue for moderating enthusiasm for the use of PTA and for limiting its routine use to nonorificial atherosclerotic lesions and fibrodysplastic lesions restricted to the main renal artery. Orificial atherosclerotic lesions, branch fibrodysplastic lesions, and congenital stenoses have a high probability of failure, complications, or both when treated by PTA and should be considered for primary operative intervention.",

    "abstract": "Previous attempts to quantify blood flow by means of ultrasound have been hampered by inaccurate diameter measurements and failure to account for the parabolic nature of the cross-sectional velocity profile. Angiodynography (ADG) provides a B-mode image of vessel walls, and the outer flow envelope is constantly monitored to provide phasic diameter measurements throughout the cardiac cycle. Frequency shifts are color-coded to provide a real-time visual display of varying velocity patterns across the vessel lumen throughout the cardiac cycle as well as calculation of average flow velocity and mean blood flow. Simultaneous flow values obtained with ADG were compared with electromagnetic flow probe (EMF) measurements in 12 open-chest dogs. Flow was varied with volume administration and exsanguination, and 201 data points were obtained. The average flow determined by EMF was 2.0 +/- 0.9 L/min compared with 2.04 +/- 0.71 L/min for ADG. The correlation coefficient was 0.88, the y-intercept was close to zero, and the slope approached unity, confirming the ability of ADG to accurately determine volume blood flow rather than merely to establish a flow trend. It is concluded that ADG offers an accurate way of quantifying volume blood flow.",

In fact, the presence of a colostomy has been reported to be a contraindication for abdominal aortic reconstruction. This report is concerned with vascular operations in 13 such patients with aortic disease referred to us for fear of these complications. Eleven patients had abdominal aortic aneurysms and two had atherosclerotic occlusion of the aorta and iliac arteries. Twelve patients had colostomies, ileostomies, or both and one patient had permanent tube cystostomy. All had good renal function and the disease for which the diversion procedure was performed was either cured or under good control. All patients survived the vascular reconstructive procedures without significant complications and long-term follow-up revealed that late graft infection did not occur.",

Twenty-four patients were identified as having a prosthetic graft infection, yielding an overall infection rate of 0.92%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, occurring in one third of the cases. The most common graft material was polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (33%) followed by Dacron (29%), composite PTFE and Dacron (20%), and umbilical vein grafts (9%). Diabetes was a common factor in one third of the patients. Symptoms of infection were present in 15 patients (63%) within 3 months of operation, with 11 patients showing symptoms within 30 days. The longest interval between operation and onset of symptoms was 48 months. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered to 22 of the 24 patients, but in only 7 of the 22 (29.5%) were they given according to our usual practice. All patients required removal of the infected prosthesis, with limb loss in 17% and death in 17%.",

To investigate this problem, two commonly used grafts (Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) and two types of vascular suture (polypropylene and PTFE) were exposed to argon laser radiation in vitro. Dacron and PTFE grafts recovered from amputations were also studied to determine whether graft \"healing\" affected graft resistance to laser damage. Power and energy levels required to perforate atherosclerotic superficial femoral arteries were determined for comparison. PTFE grafts were significantly (1.5 to 7 times) more resistant to perforation by laser energy than atherosclerotic arteries under all conditions. In contrast, Dacron grafts perforated at power and energy levels one half to one third of that required for vaporization of atherosclerotic plaque. PTFE sutures remained intact at power and energy levels above the levels that perforated atherosclerotic arteries, whereas polypropylene sutures were destroyed by very low levels of power and energy (0.5 joules at 0.5 watts). Because of the variable levels of power and energy that damage different types of prosthetic grafts and sutures, laser angioplasty should only be investigated clinically as a therapy for anastomotic intimal hyperplasia when PTFE grafts and sutures are present.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental studies of temporary skeletal muscle ischemia in dogs showed that progressive deterioration in cell membrane electrical potentials (Em) occurred after partial but not total ischemia. With intracellular adenosine triphosphate concentration within the normal range, cell membrane damage by oxygen-derived free radicals was considered. In rats subjected to 60 minutes of infrarenal aortic occlusion, intra-arterial superoxide dismutase infused during removal of the aortic clamp prevented the continued decrease in Em. These data suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals may be mediators of reperfusion injury of cell membranes.",

Siphon stenoses less than 50% were not included because of their doubtful anatomic and hemodynamic significance. No patients with stenosis greater than 80% underwent operation. Moderate siphon stenosis affected 37 vessels, 24 (14.2%) ipsilateral and 13 (7.6%) contralateral to the side of operation. Eight patients had bilateral siphon stenosis. Three patients had stroke after operation; none of these cases had siphon stenosis. Moderate siphon stenosis did not increase the risk of perioperative cerebral infarction. Stroke only occurred in those patients in whom there was arteriographic or functional evidence that the affected hemisphere was isolated from effective collateral vessels.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord damage caused by ischemia is a serious, underappreciated, and relatively refractory problem in clinical practice. Research is hampered by a lack of experimental models that appropriately mimic clinical situations. A new model of paraplegia in the rat is presented and evaluated by standard neurologic deficit scoring (1, 4, 18, and 24 hours after occlusion) and by computerized activity monitoring (1 and 18 hours after occlusion). Rats underwent temporary occlusion of the thoracic aorta for 10, 15, or 20 minutes. Experimental groups received glucose (2 gm/kg) and demonstrated a significant elevation in blood glucose (p = 0.001) and were significantly more neurologically impaired at all four time periods (p less than or equal to 0.005) than the ischemic control group, which received equivalent volumes of normal saline solution. Significant differences in neurologic deficit were noted with direct clinical examination and computerized activity monitoring. With the use of the latter system, statistical differences were detected in total distance traveled and number of vertical movements. We conclude the following: (1) Paraplegia is reliably and reproducibly achieved in this rat model; (2) because of the rat's more extensive behavioral repertoire when compared with other models of spinal ischemia (e.g., rabbit), more end points can be monitored and more subtle behavioral deficits discerned; (3) computerized activity monitoring can distinguish varying degrees of neurologic deficit and correlates with clinical neurologic deficit scoring; and (4) glucose exacerbates paraplegia in this model.",

This therapy combined a continuous urokinase (UK) infusion of 1000 U/kg/hr and a lysyl plasminogen (LYS-PLG) infusion of 15 mukat every 30 minutes. Angiographically confirmed lysis was obtained in 77% of the cases. Five percent of the patients had major and 8% had minor groin hematomas. Only two patients had concentrations of fibrinogen as low as 100 mg/dl. Intravascular infusion of UK and LYS-PLG is as effective as streptokinase but produces lower systemic fibrinolysis. However, local fibrinolysis remains a potentially hazardous procedure (10% suffered major complications) and must only be applied to patients with severe ischemia and little or no possibility of surgical intervention.",

In this study of 932 patients entered into the computer registry of the Cleveland Vascular Society, 19 surgeons representing 13 community hospitals and referral centers in Cleveland and Akron report the intermediate-term outcome during a mean interval of 35 months after infrainguinal lower extremity revascularization performed in northeastern Ohio from 1978 through 1982. Operative risk (5%), the early amputation rate (7%), and actuarial 5-year survival (48% to 55%) for patients with rest pain or tissue necrosis were significantly worse (p less than 0.05) than comparable figures (0.6%, 0%, and 77%, respectively) for others who underwent procedures for disabling claudication. Although both materials had similar success above the knee, the cumulative 3-year patency rate of autogenous vein bypass to the distal popliteal (69% to 88%; p less than 0.05) and tibioperoneal arteries (43%; 0.05 less than p less than 0.1) was superior to the results of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (32% to 50% and 19%, respectively). Moreover, polytetrafluoroethylene grafts required reoperations at three times the rate of vein grafts to maintain limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "In this study the early and late results of surgical reconstruction for renovascular hypertension caused by fibrodysplasia are evaluated in 53 patients treated between 1962 and 1983. There were 40 female and 13 male patients. The mean blood pressure was 208/126 mm Hg before medical therapy and 171/109 mm Hg thereafter. Bilateral renal artery stenoses were present in 12 patients. In situ revascularization was used in 26 patients and extracorporeal surgery to repair branch artery lesions was performed in 27 patients. Surgical therapy reduced the blood pressure to normal levels with minimal antihypertensive medications. This effect was already apparent 6 to 12 months after operation (mean blood pressure level of 140/90 mm Hg) and it was maintained during a mean follow-up period of 8.4 years (range 1 to 20 years) (mean blood pressure level of 134/85 mm Hg). At 6 to 12 months after operation, 79% of the patients were classified as either cured or improved. At this time the results did not appear to have been influenced by the preoperative duration of hypertension, nor by manifestations of extrarenal arteriosclerosis (ERA) as found in 10 patients, or by the surgical technique applied. But at the end of the long-term follow-up period (mean 8.3 years) the beneficial response rate of 87% appeared to have been adversely influenced by the presence of preoperative ERA, since beneficial response rates were 93% for those without and 67% for those with ERA (p = 0.17). We conclude that renal revascularization is effective both early and late for the treatment of renovascular hypertension caused by fibrodysplasia and that complex renovascular obstruction can be treated effectively with extracorporeal repair.",

    "abstract": "Amaurosis fugax is considered an ocular transient ischemic attack with an ominous prognosis. One hundred twenty-eight patients with amaurosis fugax as the presenting symptom underwent carotid endarterectomy at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Scripps Clinic between 1970 and 1985 with one death (0.8%) and one postoperative permanent stroke (0.8%). Subsequently, these patients were followed up for 6 to 160 months (mean 45.3 months). Only two subsequent late strokes were documented (at 2 and 5 years after operation). These results were significantly better (p less than 0.01) by life-table analysis than the late stroke rate after carotid endarterectomy performed to treat anterior motor transient ischemic attacks at both UCSD and Scripps Clinic, as well as the reported late follow-up for all transient ischemic attacks after carotid endarterectomy in the literature (1.8% per year, 17 publications, 1980 operations). Thus amaurosis fugax appears to be a particularly favorable indication for carotid endarterectomy. Left untreated, this event carries a high risk of stroke; after carotid endarterectomy, which has a low operative risk, there is a very low postoperative stroke rate (two strokes in 448 patient-years of follow-up).",

In addition to our case, which forms the basis of this article, only 13 documented instances could be found in the literature in the 20-year period from 1966 to 1986. Three of these cases (21%) had both fungus and bacteria grown in culture. Candida and Aspergillus species constituted most of the infecting organisms (79%). There was no obvious difference in the clinical presentations between fungal and bacterial infections. In two cases (14%), there was a strong predisposition toward fungal infection: one in a patient with pulmonary histoplasmosis and one in a patient with leukemia. Appropriate intervention appears to be graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass with concomitant therapy with amphotericin B. Survival with this approach was 84%, whereas other methods yielded a survival rate of 20%.",

As a control, a similar series was performed without patching. Autologous saphenous vein was used as a patch in one group of patients, whereas in another, the bifurcation was widened by suturing the external carotid to the internal carotid artery, advancing the bifurcation by several centimeters, a technique we termed bifurcation advancement. All three groups were studied at least 1 year after operation by means of Doppler ultrasonography. We found no difference in either of the patched techniques compared with unpatched controls. Significant recurrent stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) was found in 12.5% of reconstructions with a vein patch, 12.5% of those with bifurcation advancement, and 16.6% of those with simple closure. The overall incidence of significant recurrent stenosis was 13.8%, with symptoms occurring in 2.7%.",

    "abstract": "Currently available prosthetic vascular grafts remain sufficiently thrombogenic to preclude their use as small-caliber arterial substitutes. However, thrombogenicity may be significantly reduced by the presence of an endothelial monolayer on the luminal surface. The present study was undertaken to test the efficacy of lining a small-caliber prosthesis with autogenous endothelial cells in vitro so that the graft may subsequently be implanted with an established confluent endothelial lining. For this purpose, cells were obtained from canine external jugular vein, harvested enzymatically, and passaged in culture. Dacron grafts (4 X 150 mm) were then seeded in vitro and maintained for 48 to 72 hours before implantation in the femoral position of the same animal. Seeded grafts were implanted contralateral to unseeded control grafts and explanted after 1 month. Seeded grafts demonstrated an 86% patency rate at explanation in contrast to the significantly lower 14% patency rate of the unseeded control grafts. This study justifies further investigation directed toward the feasibility of endothelializing intravascular prostheses in vitro before implantation.",

    "abstract": "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (Gore-Tex) and human umbilical vein (Biograft) arterial grafts were compared for below-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafting in a prospective randomized clinical trial. One hundred five patients (105 limbs) entered the trial. Seventy-six percent suffered from rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene. The median postoperative ankle-arm blood pressure index was 0.36. Twenty-three limbs had three patent tibial arteries, 46 limbs had two tibial arteries, 31 limbs had one patent artery, and five limbs had isolated popliteal segments. Thirty-four percent were repeat operations. Fifty-five patients were allocated to receive PTFE grafts and 50 to receive human umbilical vein grafts. The two groups were comparable as to preoperative risk factors and operative and postoperative treatment. During the first 4 years (maximum 1609 days) 40 PTFE grafts and 24 umbilical veins occluded. At 1 year the PTFE patency rate was 53% and at 4 years was 22%. For umbilical vein the corresponding figures were 74% and 42% (p = 0.005, Gehan test). During follow-up the incidence of PTFE failure was on the average 2.1 times higher than that of umbilical vein failure (95% confidence limits 1.2 to 3.4).",

    "abstract": "In a prospective study, we assessed the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of intraoperative angioscopy for peripheral vascular procedures. Sixty-seven vessels and 17 bypass grafts were examined with a flexible, multichannel, fiberoptic endoscope (outer diameter 2.8 mm), with video projection of a magnified image used during the following operations: femoropopliteal or femorotibial bypass (14), aortofemoral (six), axillopopliteal bypass (one), and femoral embolectomy (three). Preoperative angiograms were compared with the findings at prebypass intraoperative angioscopy. Immediately after bypass, angioscopic appearances of the graft, anastomosis, and distal runoff artery were compared with a completion angiogram. Significant disparity between angioscopy and arteriography occurred in five patients (21%), with resultant change of management in three (12.5%). In comparison to angioscopy, the arteriograms gave a false negative rate of 12.5% (3 of 24) and a false positive rate of 8% (2 of 24). Angioscopy was accurate for assessment of anastomoses in all cases and was particularly beneficial for monitoring balloon catheter embolectomy. Complications were limited to three instances of vasospasm when the scope was used in narrow vessels. No embolization, intimal trauma, infection, or vessel perforation occurred. We conclude that angioscopy promises to be a safe and accurate alternative technique for intraoperative assessment, monitoring anastomotic results and controlling therapeutic procedures.",

    "abstract": "The clinical value of indium 111-labeled white blood cell (WBC) scanning done after vascular graft procedures was investigated to differentiate noninfectious postoperative inflammation associated with graft incorporation from early prosthetic graft infection. Indium 111-labeled WBC scans were initially obtained in 30 patients before discharge from the hospital and during the subsequent follow-up period (334 days). Fourteen of 30 patients (47%) had normal predischarge scans that included all 10 patients who had grafts confined to the abdomen and 4 of 20 patients (20%) who had grafts arising or terminating at the femoral arteries (p less than 0.05). Sixteen of 30 patients (53%) discharged with abnormal initial indium 111 WBC scans underwent serial scanning until the scan normalized or a graft complication developed. All of the 16 patients had grafts involving the groin region. Abnormal indium 111 uptake in the femoral region continued for a mean 114 days without the development of prosthetic graft infections. The sensitivity of indium 111-labeled WBC scans for detecting wound complications was 100%, whereas the specificity was 50%. Thus, the accuracy of the test was only 53%. We conclude that (1) abnormal indium 111 WBC scans are common after graft operations involving the groin region but are unusual after vascular procedures confined to the abdomen, and (2) in the absence of clinical suspicion, the indium 111-labeled WBC scan does not reliably predict prosthetic graft infection because of the low specificity of the test in the early postoperative period.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine whether laser energy could be used effectively to resect atherosclerotic plaque through an endoscope in a live animal model. Twelve adult Yorkshire swine with infrarenal aortic atherosclerosis had a 2.5 mm and/or 3.2 mm diameter fiberscope passed into the aorta from the femoral artery after proximal aortic balloon occlusion. Endoscopic argon laser resection of the atherosclerotic plaque was then attempted in eight pigs with an argon laser fiber (60 to 400 microns). We were able to visualize the raised atherosclerotic plaque in all 12 pigs with the larger 3.2 mm diameter fiberscope, which was easily passed into the aortoiliac system from the 4 mm diameter femoral vessel. The articulating end feature enhanced maneuverability within the lumen and allowed laser fiber direction. The 2.5 mm endoscope did not allow adequate visualization in any pig since the vessel could not be cleared of blood. The 2.5 mm endoscope was also passed from the femoral artery distally into the hind limb and still did not allow adequate visualization of the vessel wall because of persistent luminal blood. The 3.2 mm endoscope enabled vessel wall visualization distal to the femoral artery when the proximal artery was occluded. No aortas were grossly perforated by the laser energy. In all pigs undergoing endoscopic laser resection, raised plaques were removed both grossly and histologically, although the plaque edges were carbonized and frayed as well as vaporized. With the small spot size of the argon fiber, channels were drilled through plaque, frequently with incomplete recanalization of the lumen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "For the past 15 years at our institution, all acute diabetic foot problems have been treated on the vascular surgery service. The treatment approach has emphasized aggressive local foot surgery and frequent use of revascularization to avoid amputation. A total of 212 urgent or emergent foot operations were performed on 138 limbs in 114 diabetic patients for indications of infection, gangrene, or infected neurotrophic ulcers. The average number of operations per limb was 1.5 (range one to six) and per patients was 1.9 (range one to nine). Ischemia was sufficiently severe to require concurrent lower extremity revascularization in 48 limbs in 43 patients. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 11 years (mean 3 years). Ultimately 36 major lower extremity amputations were required in 33 patients at time intervals ranging from zero to 86 months (mean 7 months) after the initial operation on the affected limb. These data indicate that an aggressive program of surgical treatment of diabetic foot problems combined with liberal use of lower extremity revascularization resulted in long-term salvage of 73% of threatened limbs in these high-risk patients. These results form the basis for our recommendation that major lower extremity amputations be considered only as a last resort in diabetic patients with limbs threatened by foot infection or localized gangrene.",

    "abstract": "The results of 60 femorofemoral, 27 axillobifemoral, and 15 axillounifemoral bypasses were analyzed. Considered in this order, the operative mortality rate was zero, 11%, and 13%, respectively; initial hemodynamic failure was 7%, 13%, and 9%, respectively; 5-year overall primary patency rate was 67%, 62%, and 19%, respectively; and the secondary patency rate was 74%, 82%, and 37%, respectively. However, axillobifemoral patency was made to seem better by including six cases (12 graft limbs) performed because of nonocclusive disease (aneurysm or failure of graft performed for aneurysm). Excluding these, axillobifemoral primary and secondary patency decreased to 47% and 69%, respectively. Femorofemoral bypass results were made worse by cases performed because of unilateral failure of an aortic bifurcation graft. Exclusion of these bypasses increased primary and secondary patency rates to 74% and 82%, respectively. Occlusion of the major outflow artery (superficial femoral) markedly affected long-term patency of all three bypasses. Thus, \"good\" and \"poor\" runoff primary patencies were, respectively, for femorofemoral bypass 79% and 53%, for axillobifemoral bypass 92% and 41%, respectively (occlusive disease only), and for axillounifemoral bypass 54% and zero, respectively. This detailed breakdown of results explains the wide variances in the reported results for these extra-anatomic bypasses and provides a better perspective for their application in different clinical settings.",

The carotid bifurcation in 900 patients was evaluated by angiography and ultrasound. In 216 cases, high-quality endarterectomy specimens were available for comparison with the preoperative images. All comparisons were made in a blinded fashion. Results indicate that ultrasound is able to differentiate angiographically normal from abnormal arteries with a sensitivity of 88% (1077 of 1233 arteries) and accuracy of 79% (1251 of 1578 arteries). Angiographic stenoses equal to or greater than 50% diameter were accurately identified by ultrasound imaging in 72% (1133 of 1578 arteries) of cases, and this was improved by the addition of other functional data (i.e., Doppler spectral analysis and oculoplethysmography). There was only modest correlation of absolute measurements of lesion width, minimal lumen, and standard lumen by the two imaging techniques (r = 0.28 to 0.55). Ultrasound measurements of lesion width were on the average 2 mm greater than those of angiography. The lumen averaged 1.5 mm larger when measured by ultrasound techniques. In the subset in which data were available from endarterectomy specimens, ultrasound showed the best correlation with lesion width (mean difference -1.1 mm) and angiography correlated best with minimal lumen (mean difference -0.1 mm). Neither examination consistently identified ulcerated plaques. Although ultrasound imaging alone has limited usefulness in quantitating luminal stenosis, this can be improved by the use of Doppler spectral analysis and oculoplethysmography. Ultrasound is superior to angiography for quantifying atherosclerotic plaque (lesion width) and will be an important tool for further study of atherosclerotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical (or functional) adaptation of venoarterial grafts has been demonstrated recently. We reexamined one aspect of this biochemical \"arterialization\" process: prostacyclin (PGI2) production by canine venoarterial autologous grafts and the responsiveness of this biosynthetic pathway to maximal stimulation with substrate enhancement. Four reversed autologous grafts (femoral vein) were interposed into both carotid and femoral arteries in eight dogs. After 12 weeks, the grafts were removed, and radioimmunoassay was used to determine luminal surface production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2) in both the basal and stimulated (27 mumol/L arachidonic acid [AA]) states. PGI2 production by the venous autologous grafts was compared with that of control native artery and vein. We confirmed that PGI2 production (measured in nanograms per milliliter) by control artery was greater than vein under both basal conditions (5.8 +/- 0.4 [+/- SEM] vs. 2.7 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.001) and stimulated conditions (8.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.4, p = 0.002); moreover, AA stimulation significantly increased PGI2 production in both native artery and vein compared with basal PGI2 production. Under basal conditions, graft PGI2 production (6.3 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) was not significantly different than basal arterial levels (p = 0.8) but was higher than basal venous levels (p = 0.05). However, in marked contrast to both native artery and vein, the vein graft flow surface showed no significant response to substrate enhancement with AA: basal (6.3 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) vs. stimulated (5.9 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) (p = 0.8). These observations confirm that canine venoarterial autologous grafts undergo biochemical \"arterialization\"; however, this process appears to be an incomplete one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Three methods for estimating peripheral artery pressure gradients from ultrasound data were assessed by means of an acute canine aortic coarctation with a variable stenosis and retrospective data from 18 patients with iliac stenoses who had duplex scanning studies and pressure measurements at the time of angiography. The measured pressure difference was correlated with end-diastolic velocity, the presence or absence of reverse flow in diastole, and a pressure difference calculated with the modified Bernoulli equation. Although the calculated pressure gradients correlated well with measured values in animal studies (11 animals, r = 0.78, n = 224, SD = 8.1), they did not in the clinical studies (r = 0.54, n = 33, SD = 28). In both cases, pressure gradients were consistently overestimated for mild stenoses. There was a strong correlation between end-diastolic velocity and pressure gradient (r = 0.71, n = 94, SD = 5.2 for animal studies; r = 0.81, n = 36, SD = 23 for clinical studies), but the data were too variable to provide useful pressure estimates. In clinical studies the absence of reverse flow in diastole at the site of the stenosis was the best indicator of a resting pressure gradient of greater than 15 mm Hg. We conclude that the modified Bernoulli equation and end-diastolic velocity correlate highly with the pressure gradient but are not clinically useful because the variability is too great. The absence of reverse flow in diastole is a more reliable indicator of hemodynamically significant stenosis.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the healing of laser-welded and sutured canine femoral arteriovenous anastomoses. Arteriovenous fistulas 2 cm in length were created bilaterally in the femoral vessels of 10 dogs and were studied at 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 2), 4 (n = 3), and 8 (n = 3) weeks. In each animal, one anastomosis (control) was closed with running 6-0 polypropylene sutures, and the contralateral anastomosis (experimental) was sealed with an argon laser (0.5 watt, 4 minutes of exposure, 1830 J/cm2/1 cm length of anastomosis). At removal all experimental anastomoses were patent without hematomas, aneurysms, or luminal narrowing. Histologic examination at 4 weeks revealed that laser-welded anastomoses had less inflammatory response and almost normal collagen and elastin reorientation. At 8 weeks sutured anastomoses had significant intimal hyperplasia whereas laser repairs had normal luminal architecture. Tensile strength and collagen production, measured by the synthesis of hydroxyproline and the steady-state levels of type I and type III procollagen messenger ribonucleic acids, at the anastomoses and in adjacent vein and artery specimens were similar in sutured and laser-welded repairs at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. We conclude that argon laser welding of anastomoses is an acceptable alternative to suture techniques, with the advantage of improved healing without foreign body response and possible diminished intimal hyperplasia at the anastomotic line.",

There were no treatment complications in this group of patients. This technique of balloon angioplasty is compared with the results of treatment in eight patients with fibromuscular dysplasia of the internal carotid artery, who had percutaneous transfemoral angioplasty.

    "abstract": "In previous baboon studies we have shown that porous (60 micron mean internodal distance) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts heal by ingrowth of endothelium and smooth muscle cells from the adjacent artery and from capillaries penetrating through the interstices of the graft. However, porous grafts (principally made of Dacron) in humans do not heal. This has been attributed to a wound healing deficiency in humans; however, it might be due to an inhibitory effect of the Dacron itself. To examine the latter possibility, we undertook this study to compare the healing of 4 mm internal diameter porous Dacron grafts (USCI, Sauvage Filamentous Knitted) with that of Gore-Tex 60 micron PTFE grafts in baboons (the latter graft not available for clinical use). The grafts were harvested at 2, 4, and 12 weeks and assessed for (1) percentage of endothelial coverage, (2) endothelial cell (EC) proliferation (thymidine labeling index), (3) intimal area, and (4) smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation (thymidine labeling index). The PTFE grafts at all three time points were fully covered, whereas only one of five Dacron grafts was completely covered at 12 weeks. The intima of the PTFE grafts consisted of ECs and SMCs, whereas that of the Dacron grafts contained ECs and SMCs as well as focal accumulations of thrombus. The intimal cross-sectional areas in the Dacron grafts (3.0 +/- 1.2 mm2) were significantly greater than in the PTFE grafts (0.8 +/- 0.6 mm2) at 4 weeks; there was no difference at 12 weeks (Dacron, 2.6 +/- 2.3 mm2 and PTFE, 3.0 +/- 2.5 mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The Joint Committee on Vascular Surgical Manpower was established in 1985 by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. It was charged to provide recommendations regarding vascular surgical manpower requirements for the next 15 years. Analysis of National Center for Health Statistics vascular operative rate data and 1690 questionnaire responses from vascular surgeons documented that vascular surgeons performed 235,400 (41%) of the total of 571,000 vascular operations undertaken in 1985. Vascular surgeons performed 87% of 30,000 aortoiliofemoral reconstructions, 77% of 72,000 peripheral vessel bypasses, 75% of 33,000 abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, 59% of 55,000 angioaccess procedures, and 50% of 107,000 carotid endarterectomies. However, lack of accurate data on caseloads of surgeons who were not vascular specialists precludes precise prediction of manpower requirements for vascular surgery. It is important that surgical leaders and policy makers define the types of vascular surgical procedures that may be undertaken by vascular and other surgeons. Ongoing analyses must include such determinations to establish accurate data for the prediction of future manpower needs for vascular surgery. Furthermore, future manpower studies should be linked to outcome studies to assess not only numbers of surgeons and operations but quality of care as well.",

Spontaneous iliac arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication of these aneurysms with only 16 cases previously described. The diagnosis depends on a strong clinical suspicion and usually requires angiography for confirmation. We report a case in which CT with contrast medium showed clear findings of a spontaneous iliac arteriovenous fistula complicating rupture of an isolated iliac artery aneurysm. CT findings included: (1) iliac artery aneurysm, (2) vena caval dilatation, (3) rapid flow of contrast medium from the arterial side into the dilated inferior vena cava on dynamic scanning, (4) increased density of the inferior vena cava similar to that of the aorta caused by entry through the fistula of blood with a high concentration of iodinated contrast medium, and (5) the actual fistula connecting the two vessels.",

In each instance the patient was hospitalized and intravenous heparin therapy was started. Phlebography demonstrated venous outflow obstruction without thrombosis; subsequent CT scanning revealed an obstructing lesion in each case. At surgical exploration, (1) endoaneurysmorrhaphy of a hypogastric artery aneurysm decompressed an obstructed right iliac vein; (2) a primary iliac vein leiomyosarcoma was extirpated; (3) a synovial cyst arising from the right hip joint, which obstructed the femoral vein, was excised; and, (4) a postherniorrhaphy inflammatory mass obstructing the left iliofemoral vein junction was confirmed with biopsy results. Improved diagnostic accuracy with its attendant specific therapy is achieved in suspected cases of iliofemoral vein thrombosis if, in addition to noninvasive venous studies or phlebography, CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis is performed.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective review of 106 cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was undertaken to determine whether analysis of preoperative variables might be predictive of death in this condition. Thirty variables were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods. Statistically significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors were noted for 12 of 30 factors when analyzed with univariate tests. Multivariate analysis with stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that elevation of the unmeasured anion gap, a history of congestive heart failure, and the patient's level of consciousness before operation were significantly and independently associated with death. Coefficients generated from this model allowed stratification of patients into four risk groups with respective mortality rates of 100%, 75%, 28%, and 12%. We conclude that it is possible to assign a mortality risk score to individual cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm on the basis of readily available clinical and laboratory parameters. A prospective study to address this question seems justified.",

Lodoxamide (20 mg/kg/hr) or 0.9% sodium chloride was infused beginning 15 minutes before infrarenal aortic occlusion and continuing for 105 minutes. With an occlusion time of 20 minutes, eight of eight lodoxamide-treated animals and five of eight saline-treated animals regained function after reperfusion. However, by 48 hours after occlusion, seven of eight saline-treated animals were completely paralyzed, whereas only two of eight lodoxamide-treated animals were paralyzed. An ischemia time of 30 minutes exceeded the protective capacity of this treatment. These results suggest lodoxamide may be useful in alleviating ischemic damage to the spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma extends into the inferior vena cava in 5% of patients undergoing exploratory surgery for this malignancy. If the tumor is left unresected, death within 1 year is certain. In addition, caval occlusion may result in massive lower extremity edema, ascites, hepatic failure, and pulmonary embolus. During the past 17 years, 12 patients with renal cell carcinoma extending into the inferior vena cava were treated at a single institution by radical nephrectomy and caval tumor extraction. There were 10 men (83%) and ages ranged from 50 to 78 years (mean 63 years). There was one operative death (8%) caused by refractory coagulopathy. Long-term follow-up was achieved for all survivors. One- and 3-year survival rates by life-table method were 73% and 27%, respectively. Mean survival time after resection was 32 months. Careful preoperative planning is essential. The optimal approach for venacaval tumor extraction or resection is dictated by the cephalad extent of tumor seen on preoperative thoracoabdominal CT scan, ultrasound, or inferior venacavography. Disease limited to the infrahepatic vena cava is best approached with a thoracoabdominal incision through the eighth intercostal space. Extension of tumor to the hepatic veins or right atrium requires median sternotomy in combination with an abdominal incision for complete removal. An ellipse of vena cava around the origin of the renal vein is excised with the specimen. The resultant incision is closed by lateral phleborrhaphy. Late sequelae of the mild caval narrowing were not observed. An aggressive multispecialty surgical policy for caval extraction and resection of renal cell carcinoma resulted in extended patient survival and excellent palliation.",

While the aorta was clamped, blood was withdrawn through the venous cannula, and oxygenated blood was delivered to the legs through the arterial cannula. This procedure allowed clamping and unclamping of the aorta to proceed without hemodynamic fluctuation. Intraoperatively, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance were measured. Both patients recovered, which indicates that this technique may be safely undertaken in the severely compromised patient with cardiac disease.",

    "abstract": "Eighty-three patients, 43 women and 40 men, with hemispheric transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and normal angiograms were studied. Fifty-two of the patients had a single episode of transient ischemia, whereas 31 had multiple episodes prompting initial evaluation. Follow-up ranging from 3 to 132 months was obtained for all patients. In this period, six patients suffered a cerebrovascular accident and five had further hemispheric TIAs. These results are in contrast to our earlier data, which suggested a benign prognosis in this group of patients. Results of this updated study show that the prognosis of patients with hemispheric TIAs and normal angiograms is not so benign as originally reported. Those patients with multiple events before initial evaluation are at increased risk of subsequent cerebrovascular accident or TIA. Close observation of this group of patients is recommended.",

The introduction of powerful, inexpensive microcomputers and \"user-friendly\" programs for data base management has made it possible to organize large amounts of information for subsequent review. Using such a microcomputer-based system, we developed a practical approach to the storage and retrieval of vascular surgical references, which permits virtually unlimited numbers of articles to be catalogued and quickly retrieved with multiple search parameters. This system has been operational in our Division of Vascular Surgery for nearly a year and currently contains more than 3000 journal articles that are readily available for resident teaching, patient care, and research.",

    "abstract": "Because prosthetic neointima produces much less prostacyclin (PGI2) than arterial intima and may be more susceptible to cyclooxygenase inhibition, aspirin treatment might enhance surface thrombogenesis. To test this hypothesis, aortic prostheses were placed in eight dogs and measurements of platelet survival and platelet serotonin (5HT) were made under conditions of no treatment and treatment with low-dose (2mg/kg) and high-dose (30 mg/kg) aspirin. These doses equally suppressed platelet function. Measurements were performed preoperatively, 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively (when little neointima was present), and 28 to 32 weeks postoperatively (neointima fully developed). Platelet survival and 5HT levels were markedly reduced 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and returned to normal at 28 to 32 weeks after implantation. At all times, low-dose aspirin improved platelet survival and this effect was most apparent 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively. Treatment with either aspirin dose decreased platelet 5HT levels at the 28 to 32 week postoperative period but not at other times. At recovery of prostheses, 90% of the luminal surface was covered with endothelialized neointima. Neointimal production of PGI2 was one half to one third that of aortic production. Despite this, low- and high-dose aspirin equally suppressed PGI2 production from both neointima and aorta. Furthermore, aspirin did not increase labeled platelet uptake on neointima. We conclude that (1) aspirin treatment does not render prosthetic neointima thrombogenic and (2) aspirin alters platelet survival and 5HT levels by mechanisms other than inhibition of platelet and neointima cyclooxygenase.",

    "abstract": "The importance of initial human trials with autologous endothelial seeding lies not only in the implementation of a promising idea but also in the fact that canine data are only partially applicable to humans. The surface area of jugular veins in humans is much smaller than in dogs and considerably longer grafts are needed. Moreover, the reproductive capacity of adult human endothelial cells under in vivo conditions, which probably determines the success of seeding more than the seeding density, is also uncertain. Therefore the efficiency of autologous endothelial seeding in humans was investigated in 18 patients undergoing distal femoropopliteal bypass surgery. The average surface area of the jugular veins was 4.9 +/- 1.7 cm2 with an average cell yield of 32.6 +/- 18.0 x 10(4). The mean number of seeded cells per square centimeter of graft surface was 3.1 x 10(3). In a follow-up extending for 14 weeks, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin as well as the platelet function in the whole blood aggregometer showed significantly better results in the seeded group. Plasma thromboxane B2, uptake and survival of indium 111-labeled platelets, and Doppler ultrasound investigations also favored the seeded group, but the results were statistically insignificant. No difference at all was found for the platelet dense granule compounds, releasable adenosine triphosphate and platelet serotonin. Thus our findings did not indicate the development of a closed endothelialized surface after 14 weeks, which is a period three times as long as the one required for confluent endothelial cell coverage in dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This article reports a case of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated with chronic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The patient was a 68-year-old man; bleeding of 20 months' duration was reported. Physical examination indicated a pulsating mass in the abdomen. The diagnosis of DIC was made on the basis of standard coagulation studies. Indium 111-labeled platelet scintigraphy demonstrated an increased accumulation of radioactivity over the aneurysm. After preoperative control of the bleeding tendency was obtained by continuous intravenous infusion of gabexate mesilate (FOY), the aneurysm was successfully replaced with a prosthetic graft. Gabexate mesilate therapy is useful for DIC as is heparin therapy. If surgical intervention is required for an abdominal aortic aneurysm with concomitant DIC, preoperative control of bleeding with gabexate mesilate or heparin is recommended to lessen operative bleeding.",

    "abstract": "The collagen content of the media of infrarenal aorta has been compared in age- and sex-matched normal aorta and dilated and nondilated atherosclerotic aorta. The proportion of collagen was increased in aneurysmal aorta from 62% to 84% and appears to be the result of preferential elastin degradation. The ratio of type I to type III collagen, estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of specific cyanogenbromide peptides, did not vary significantly from 2:1 in any of the three groups of aortas. There was no evidence of increased collagenase activity in unruptured aneurysmal aorta. Collagenase activity was increased in ruptured aneurysmal aorta but could only be satisfactorily measured after resolution from the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. We suggest that only limited collagen turnover occurs in the media of abdominal aortic aneurysms before rupture. A subgroup of three patients with a significant family history of aneurysm had lower amounts of type III collagen in the aortic media, suggesting that abnormalities in type III collagen may be one of the genetic factors contributing to familial clustering of aneurysms.",
