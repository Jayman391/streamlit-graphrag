    "abstract": "Whereas thermal ablation of incompetent saphenous veins is highly effective, all heat-based ablation techniques require the use of perivenous subfascial tumescent anesthesia, involving multiple needle punctures along the course of the target vein. Preliminary evidence suggests that cyanoacrylate embolization (CAE) may be effective in the treatment of incompetent great saphenous veins (GSVs). We report herein early results of a randomized trial of CAE vs radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of symptomatic incompetent GSVs.\nTwo hundred twenty-two subjects with symptomatic GSV incompetence were randomly assigned to receive either CAE (n = 108) with the VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System (Sapheon, Inc, Morrisville, NC) or RFA (n = 114) with the ClosureFast system (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass). After discharge, subjects returned to the clinic on day 3 and again at months 1 and 3. The study's primary end point was closure of the target vein at month 3 as assessed by duplex ultrasound and adjudicated by an independent vascular ultrasound core laboratory. Statistical testing focused on showing noninferiority with a 10% delta conditionally followed by superiority testing. No adjunctive procedures were allowed until after the month 3 visit, and missing month 3 data were imputed by various methods. Secondary end points included patient-reported pain during vein treatment and extent of ecchymosis at day 3. Additional assessments included general and disease-specific quality of life surveys and adverse event rates.\nAll subjects received the assigned intervention. By use of the predictive method for imputing missing data, 3-month closure rates were 99% for CAE and 96% for RFA. All primary end point analyses, which used various methods to account for the missing data rate (14%), showed evidence to support the study's noninferiority hypothesis (all P < .01); some of these analyses supported a trend toward superiority (P = .07 in the predictive model). Pain experienced during the procedure was mild and similar between treatment groups (2.2 and 2.4 for CAE and RFA, respectively, on a 10-point scale; P = .11). At day 3, less ecchymosis in the treated region was present after CAE compared with RFA (P < .01). Other adverse events occurred at a similar rate between groups and were generally mild and well tolerated.\nCAE was proven to be noninferior to RFA for the treatment of incompetent GSVs at month 3 after the procedure. Both treatment methods showed good safety profiles. CAE does not require tumescent anesthesia and is associated with less postprocedure ecchymosis.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the early and midterm to long-term experience of chimney grafts (CGs) in urgent endovascular repair of complex lesions in the thoracic aorta.\nTwenty-nine high-risk patients (20 men) who were unfit for open repair were treated using CG technique for ruptured (n = 14) or symptomatic (n = 15) aortic lesions engaging the aortic arch itself (n = 9), the descending aorta (n = 10), or the thoracoabdominal aorta (n = 10). Twenty-two patients (76%) were treated urgently (\u226424 hours) and seven were semiurgent (\u22643 days). Of 41 chimneys used, 24 were placed in supra-aortic branches and 17 in visceral branches. Median follow-up (interquartile range) for the entire cohort was 2 years (0.6-3.8 years), 2.5 years (1-4 years) for 30-day survivors, and 3.5 years (1.9-6.4 years) for those who were still alive.\nFour patients (14%) died \u226430 days of cerebral infarction (n = 1), visceral ischemia secondary to the initial rupture (n = 1), multiple organ failure (n = 1), or heart failure (n = 1). There were 11 late deaths (38%); however, only two deaths were related to the CG technique. The primary and secondary technical success rates were 86% (25 of 29) and 97% (28 of 29), respectively. The secondary patency rate of CGs was 98%. Seventeen (68%) of the aortic lesions shrank significantly. Three patients (10%) had primary type I endoleak and another three (10%) had secondary type I endoleak. The endoleaks were managed with Onyx (ev3 Endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, Minn) or coil embolization (n = 2), restenting (n = 1), and conversion to open repair (n = 2). One secondary endoleak is still under observation after >20 months. All primary endoleaks and one secondary endoleak originated from CGs in the brachiocephalic trunk (4 of 6 [67%]).\nThe midterm to long-term results of the CG technique for urgent and complex lesions of the thoracic aorta in high-risk patients are promising, with low early mortality and long durability of the CGs. More patients with longer follow-up are still needed.",

We analyzed the effect of VQI participation on perioperative (preoperative and postoperative) MM use over time and the effect of discharge MM on patient survival.\nWe studied VQI patients treated with MM preoperatively and at discharge from 2005 to 2014, including all elective carotid endarterectomy/carotid stenting (n = 28,092), suprainguinal/infrainguinal bypass (n = 11,362), peripheral vascular interventions (n = 24,476), open/endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 13,503), and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 702). We examined trends of MM use over time, as well as the effect of duration of VQI participation on MM use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with MM use. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with 5-year survival.\nMM with AP and statin preoperatively and postoperatively across VQI centers improved from 55% in 2005 to 68% in 2009, with a subsequent overall decline to 62% by 2014, coincident with many new centers with lower MM rates joining VQI in 2010. Longer center participation in VQI was associated with improved perioperative MM overall. This was also noted across all procedure types, with MM increasing from 47% to 82% for aneurysm repairs and 69% to 83% for carotid procedures from 1 to 12 years of participation in VQI. After multivariable adjustment, centers in VQI \u22653 years were 30% more likely to have patients on MM (odds ratio, 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.4). Importantly, discharge on AP and statin therapy was associated with improved 5-year survival, compared with discharge on neither medication (82% [95% CI, 81%-83%] vs 67% [95% CI, 62%-72%]), and an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5-0.7; P < .001). Discharge on a single medication was associated with intermediate survival at 5 years (AP only: 77% [95% CI, 75%-79%]; statin only: 73% [95% CI, 68%-77%]).\nThese data demonstrate that MM is associated with improved survival after a number of vascular procedures. Importantly, VQI participation improves the use of MM, demonstrating that involvement in an organized quality effort can affect patient outcomes.",

After multivariable adjustment, centers in VQI \u22653 years were 30% more likely to have patients on MM (odds ratio, 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.4). Importantly, discharge on AP and statin therapy was associated with improved 5-year survival, compared with discharge on neither medication (82% [95% CI, 81%-83%] vs 67% [95% CI, 62%-72%]), and an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5-0.7; P < .001). Discharge on a single medication was associated with intermediate survival at 5 years (AP only: 77% [95% CI, 75%-79%]; statin only: 73% [95% CI, 68%-77%]).",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous celiac artery dissection is rare, and its natural history is not well studied. The objective of this study was to review our experience with the evaluation and management of this condition.\nDuring the last 8 years, 19 patients (14 men, five women) presented with the diagnosis of spontaneous celiac artery dissection. Each patient's clinical course was retrospectively reviewed, and patients were contacted for assessment of current symptoms.\nAll patients had computed tomography scans documenting a celiac artery dissection without concomitant aortic dissection. Ages ranged from 39 to 76 years. Seven patients presented with abdominal pain, and 12 were diagnosed incidentally. All patients were initially treated with observation because none had threatened end organs. Patients presenting with aspirin or clopidogrel therapy were continued on these medications, but no patients were prescribed any medications due to their dissection. Three patients continued to have abdominal pain and eventually underwent celiac artery stenting. Pain improved after the intervention in all three. One patient with aneurysmal degeneration of the celiac artery underwent surgical repair. No other patients required intervention. Eighteen patients had follow-up within a year of data collection in the clinic or over the phone. The average time from the initial diagnosis to follow-up for the entire cohort was 46 months. None had abdominal or back pain related to the celiac dissection, had lost weight, or had to change their eating habits.\nCeliac artery dissection can be safely managed initially with observation. If abdominal pain is persistent, endovascular stenting may stabilize or improve the pain, and surgical reconstruction can be done for aneurysmal degeneration or occlusion, both unusual events. Long-term anticoagulation does not appear necessary in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Many surgeons favor routine shunting during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with recent stroke who otherwise prefer selective shunt placement for other indications of CEA. We analyzed the results of CEA in this group of patients with the strategy of selective shunting.\nA retrospective review was performed of 59 patients (group A) undergoing CEA \u22648 weeks of a stroke (2000-2014) from two midsized teaching hospitals with stroke certification; of these, 38 patients had CEA \u22642 weeks and 21 other had CEA >2 weeks but <8 weeks. All patients sustained a middle cerebral artery stroke with \u226570% ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. Cervical block anesthesia was used in 43 patients and general anesthesia in 16. During the same period, 1036 CEAs were performed for other indications (group B). All patients in group A were evaluated by stroke neurologist with a National Institutes of Health stroke scale score of 1 to 4 in 22 patients (minor stroke) and 5 to 15 in 37 patients (moderate stroke). A shunt was placed if neurologic changes (contralateral motor weakness, aphasia, loss of consciousness) occurred with the carotid cross-clamping or ischemic electroencephalogram changes under general anesthesia were observed.\nThe study population consisted of 59 patients (36 males and 23 females) in group A with mean age of 70.5 \u00b1 10.7 years. Carotid duplex imaging revealed contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis of <50% in 36 patients, 50% to 70% in 13, 71% to 99% in 9, and occlusion in 1. Ten patients (16.9%) required shunt placement, which was similar to the shunt in group B (11.8% for remote stroke, 10.2% for focal transient ischemic attack/monocular blindness, and 10.9% for asymptomatic carotid stenosis). Two patients in group A had perioperative stroke and died (3.4% stroke/mortality). There were no incidences of permanent cranial nerve palsy, myocardial infarction (MI), or hematoma requiring re-exploration in patients undergoing CEA in group A. Postoperative complications in group B included new neurologic deficits (postoperative stroke) in 16 (1.6%), MI in 2 (0.2%), permanent cranial nerve palsy in 3 (0.3%), and re-exploration for neck hematoma in 7 (0.7%). Six patients died after CEA in group B, for a combined stroke/death rate of 2.0%. Seizures after CEA for a recent stroke occurred in three patients (5.1%) in group A and in none in group B (P < .002). Postoperative complications (new neurologic deficits, MI, cranial nerve palsy, and re-exploration for neck hematoma) were similar in both groups (P > .05).\nShunt requirement during CEA for acute stroke is similar to other indications of CEA. Patients undergoing CEA for recent stroke had similar incidence of postoperative new neurologic deficit/mortality, MI, and cranial nerve palsy compared with other indications of CEA but had a higher incidence of perioperative seizures.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) of infrarenal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is increasingly used in patients with suitable aortic morphology conforming to device-specific instructions for use. Despite improvements in graft design, type II endoleak (EL-2) from the inferior mesenteric artery (EL-IMA) or the lumbar artery (EL-LA) remains the Achilles' heel of EVAR. The objective of this study was to evaluate the natural history of the AAA sac after EVAR. We hypothesized that persistent EL-2 would be associated with inferior AAA sac volume regression.\nA retrospective analysis was performed on all nonruptured AAA treated by elective EVAR using Food and Drug Administration-approved endografts from January 2005 to December 2008 in our facility. Review of medical records and preoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiograms at 1, 6, and 12 months was performed. Patients with type I, III, and IV endoleaks were excluded, as were those lost to all follow-up. AAA size and volume were analyzed using TeraRecon software (Aquarius Intuition, Foster City, Calif). Change in AAA sac volume was compared in patients with and without EL-2, and with an occluded vs patent IMA.\nThe study cohort comprised 191 patients (161 men, 30 women) with a mean age of 74 years. The mean preoperative AAA diameter was 5.5 cm (range, 4-11 cm), and mean volume was 137.45 cm(3). EL-2 was present in 24% at completion of EVAR and in 9% at a mean follow-up of 6 months (range 4-8 months). Completion angiography at 1 month showed 63% of EL-2 had resolved. Those with EL-2 present at 1 month had statistically inferior sac regression compared with those who did not (23% reduction vs 2% increase at 1 year; P = .002). Preoperatively, the IMA was occluded by coils or was chronically occluded in 82 patients vs 109 patients who had a patent IMA. At the 6-month follow-up, patients with an occluded IMA had an EL-2 rate of 2.4% vs 14.7% in those with a patent IMA (P = .005 by t-test). Sac volume regression was 21.8% in those with an occluded IMA vs 13.2% in those with a patent IMA (P = .004 by t-test). Regression in AAA sac volume was highly significant in patients with occluded IMA, at 30% vs 16% at 1 year (P = .0018 by two-sided t-test).\nThe presence of persistent EL-2 after EVAR results in inferior AAA sac regression. A preoperatively patent IMA is associated with increased rates of EL-2 and inferior AAA sac regression. Consideration should be given to preoperative occlusion of a patent IMA before EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs (EVARs) with fenestrated (FEVAR) stent grafts are high radiation dose cases, yet no skin injuries were found retrospectively in our 61 cases with a mean peak skin dose (PSD) of 6.8 Gy. We hypothesize that skin injury is under-reported. This study examined deterministic effects in FEVARs after procedural changes implemented to detect skin injury.\nAll FEVARs during a 6-month period with a radiation dose of 5 Gy reference air kerma (RAK; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements threshold for substantial radiation dose level [SRDL]) were included. Patients were questioned about skin erythema, epilation, and necrosis, with a physical examination of the back completed daily until discharge and then at 2 and 4 weeks and at 3 and 6 months. PSD distributions were calculated with custom software using input data from fluoroscopic machine logs. These calculations have been validated against Gafchromic (Ashland Inc, Covington, Ky) film measurements. Dose was summed for the subset of patients with multiple procedures \u22646 months of the SRDL event, consistent with the joint commission recommendations.\nTwenty-two patients, 21 FEVARs and one embolization, reached an RAK of 5 Gy. The embolization procedure was excluded from review. The average RAK was 7.6 \u00b1 2.0 Gy (range, 5.1-11.4 Gy), with a mean PSD of 4.8 \u00b1 2.0 Gy (range, 2.3-10.4 Gy). Fifty-two percent of patients had multiple endovascular procedures \u22646 months of the SRDL event. The mean RAK for this subset was 10.0 \u00b1 2.9 Gy (range, 5.5-15.1 Gy), with a mean PSD of 6.6 \u00b1 1.9 Gy (range, 3.4-9.4 Gy). One patient died before the first postoperative visit. No radiation skin injuries were found. Putative risk factors for skin injury were evaluated and included smoking (32%), diabetes (14%), cytotoxic drugs (9%), and fair skin type (91%). No other risk factors were present (hyperthyroidism, collagen vascular disorders).\nDeterministic skin injuries are uncommon after FEVAR, even at high RAK levels, regardless of cumulative dose effects. This study addresses the concern of missed injuries based on the retrospective clinical examination findings that were published in our previous work. Even with more comprehensive postoperative skin examinations and patient questioning, the fact that no skin injuries were found suggests that radiation-induced skin injuries are multifactorial and not solely dose dependent.",

    "abstract": "This study quantified the geometry and respiration-induced deformation of abdominal branch vessels and stents after fenestrated (F-) and snorkel (Sn-) endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nTwenty patients (80% male; mean age, 75.2 \u00b1 7.4 years; mean aneurysm diameter, 6.2 \u00b1 1.8 cm) underwent computed tomography angiography during inspiratory and expiratory breath hold protocols after F-EVAR (n = 11) or Sn-EVAR (n = 9). Centerlines for the aorta and visceral vessels were extracted from three-dimensional models. Branch angles were computed relative to the orthogonal plane at the branch ostia, and end-stent angles of the left renal artery (LRA) and right renal artery (RRA) were computed relative to the distal stent orientation. The radius of peak curvature was defined by the circumscribed circle at the highest curvature.\nSn-renal branches were more downward-angled than F-renal branches (P < .04). At the distal ends of the RRA stents, Sn-RRAs were angled greater than F-RRAs (P < .03) and had a smaller radius of peak curvature (P < .03). With expiration, the end-stent angle of Sn-LRAs increased by 4\u00b0 \u00b1 4\u00b0 (P < .02) and exhibited a significant reduction of radius of curvature (P < .04). The unstented celiac arteries were more downward-angled (P < .02, inspiration), with a smaller radius of curvature (P < .00001), than the unstented superior mesenteric arteries. With expiration, the celiac arteries angled upwards by 9\u00b0 \u00b1 9\u00b0 (P < .0005), which was greater than the superior mesenteric arteries (P < .03). At a median postoperative follow-up of 12.6 months (range, 1.0-37.1 months), branch vessel patency was 100%, serum creatinine levels remained stable, and one reintervention was required for a type III endoleak at the main body-LRA stent interface.\nSn-renals were angled more inferiorly at the branch and more angulated at the stent end than F-renals due to stent placement strategies. Sn-LRAs exhibited a significant change in end-stent angle and curvature during respiration, a finding that may compromise long-term durability for parallel stent graft configurations. Further investigation is warranted to better optimize anatomic, patient, and branch vessel stent selection between fenestrated and snorkel strategies and their relationship to long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "Celiac artery compression by the median arcuate ligament (MAL) is a potential cause of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss that overlaps with other common syndromes. Robotic technology may alter the current paradigm for surgical intervention. Open MAL release is often performed with concurrent bypass for celiac stenosis due to the morbidity of reintervention, whereas the laparoscopic approach is associated with high rates of conversion to open due to bleeding. We hypothesized that a robot-assisted technique might minimize conversion events to open, decrease perioperative morbidity, and defer consideration of vascular bypass at the initial operative setting.\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients treated for MAL syndrome by a multidisciplinary team at a tertiary medical center between September 2012 and December 2013. Diagnosis was based on symptom profile and peak systolic velocity (PSV) >200 cm/s during celiac artery duplex ultrasound imaging. All patients underwent robot-assisted MAL release with simultaneous circumferential neurolysis of the celiac plexus. Postoperative celiac duplex and symptom profiles were reassessed longitudinally to monitor outcomes.\nNine patients (67% women) were evaluated for postprandial pain (100%) and weight loss (100%). All patients had celiac stenosis by mesenteric duplex ultrasound imaging (median PSV, 342; range, 238-637 cm/s), and cross-sectional imaging indicated a fishhook deformity in five (56%). Robot-assisted MAL release was completed successfully in all nine patients (100%) using a standardized surgical technique. Estimated blood loss was <50 mL, with a median hospital stay of 2 days (range, 2-3 days). No postoperative complications of grade \u22653, readmissions or reoperations were observed. All patients (100%) improved symptomatically at the 25-week median follow-up. Three patients experienced complete resolution on postoperative celiac duplex ultrasound imaging, and six patients showed an improved but persistent stenosis (PSV >200 cm/s) compared with preoperative velocities (P < .05 by Wilcoxon signed rank). No patients required additional treatment.\nRobot-assisted MAL release can be performed safely and effectively with avoidance of conversion events and minimal morbidity. Potential factors contributing to success are patient selection by a multidisciplinary team and replication of the open surgical technique by means of robot-assisted dexterity and visualization. The need for delayed reintervention for persistently symptomatic celiac stenosis is uncertain.",

    "abstract": "The supraclavicular approach to scalenectomy and first rib resection has been modified since the original description in 1985. The incision is 1 to 2 cm above the clavicle, 1 cm lateral to the midline, and 5 to 7 cm long. Subplatysmal skin flaps are created. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is mobilized on its lateral edge and retracted but not divided. The scalene fat pad is split vertically, the omohyoid muscle excised, and the C5 nerve root dissected free. The accessory phrenic nerve is identified, if present, arising medially from C5, and preserved. The rest of the plexus is dissected free, muscular and connective tissue removed from all nerve roots and trunks, and the subclavian artery identified. The phrenic nerve is identified on the medial edge of the anterior scalene muscle (ASM). The ASM is divided on the first rib. The ASM is elevated, freed, and divided as high as possible and free of C5. The middle scalene muscle is dissected. C5 and C6 branches of the long thoracic nerve are identified and protected as the portion of middle scalene muscle adjacent to the nerves of the plexus is excised. The decision on whether the first rib is to be removed is determined by whether the lower trunk of the plexus is touching the first rib. If the rib is removed, its posterior end is freed, divided, and 1 cm excised. The rest of the rib is freed from the intercostal muscles with a periosteal elevator or harmonic scalpel, the pleura is separated from the inner surface of the rib, and the anterior end divided with an infraclavicular rib cutter. The operation has been made safer by identifying and dissecting the C5 nerve root before looking for the phrenic nerve.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated and branched endografts allow for proximal sealing zone extension into or above the visceral aorta to optimize landing in healthy aorta. We describe the incidence, causes, and implications of proximal endoleak development in patients undergoing complex endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.\nAll patients undergoing a fenestrated/branched repair were entered onto a prospective database, and this analysis included all those with at least one postoperative contrast computed tomography scan. Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional imaging was reanalyzed to characterize morphology and identify endoleak. A blinded assessor used the preoperative imaging to resize the repairs in the endoleak group and a matched cohort of patients without endoleak. The outcome measures were proximal endoleak development, mortality, and component stability, and a comparison was made with all patients undergoing complex aortic repair.\nFrom 2001 to July 2013, 969 patients underwent repair in a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption trial. Excluded were 24 emergency patients and 21 patients without requisite imaging, leaving 924 available for analysis. A proximal type Ia endoleak developed in 26 patients (2.8%). Poor choice of landing zone was implicated in most cases, with an area of sealing in the visceral aorta, compared with the thoracic aorta, being significantly associated with endoleak development (P\u00a0< .01). Aortic-related mortality was significantly higher in the endoleak group (26.9%) than in the group without endoleak (6.2%; P\u00a0= .001). These patients also experienced a higher incidence of component instability of 30.8% compared with 9.6% in patients without type Ia endoleak (P\u00a0< .01).\nFenestrated/branched endovascular repair has a low incidence of sealing zone failure despite the increased complexity. However, development of a proximal endoleak destabilizes the repair and leads to increased mortality. Increasing complexity of design seems to improve the long-term outcome for patients requiring complex aortic repair.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive alternative for type II endoleak repair after endovascular aneurysm repair. However, control of lumbar and median sacral arteries is considered technically difficult due to the dense inflammatory tissue surrounding the aorta. We describe a technical tip that avoids close dissection of the aneurysm sac. After the transperitoneal approaches we commonly use during laparoscopic aortic surgery, the aneurysm is drawn rightward to access the plane of the anterior longitudinal ligament. This technique allows a direct exposure of the lumbar and median sacral arteries, which are all methodically dissected and ligated along the anterior wall of the spine without close dissection of the aneurysm sac. In our experience, this technical tip was always feasible and simplified laparoscopic type II endoleak repair.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of carotid stenting has led to a rapid rise in the number of vascular specialists performing this procedure. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST) has shown that carotid stenting can be performed with an equivalent major event rate compared with carotid endarterectomy. However, there is still controversy about the appropriate training and experience required to safely perform this procedure. This observational study examined the performance of carotid stenting with regard to specialty and case volume.\nFrom 2004 to 2011, inpatients diagnosed with carotid stenosis who had a carotid stenting procedure were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. The cohort was separated on the basis of the provider performing the procedure (surgeon vs interventionalist), hospital location, and volume. Surgeons were defined as providers who also performed either a carotid endarterectomy or femoral-popliteal bypass during the same time interval. Primary end points analyzed included stroke, myocardial infarction, and 30-day mortality. Length of stay and hospital costs were also analyzed as secondary outcomes.\nA total of 20,663 cases of carotid stenting were found; 15,305 (74%) cases were identified to be performed by a \"surgeon,\" whereas 5358 (26%) were done by an \"interventionalist.\" The majority of cases were done at hospitals in urban locations (96.51%) and designated teaching institutions (61.47%). Unadjusted outcomes were similar between surgeons and interventionalists in terms of stroke (4.33% and 4.41%), myocardial infarction (2.10% and 2.13%), and mortality (0.84% and 1.03%) respectively. Qualitatively, volume per 10 cases was shown to decrease the risk of stroke. Adjusted multivariate analysis demonstrated no statistical significance between primary end point outcomes. However, length of stay (2.81 vs 3.08\u00a0days) and total charges ($48,087.61 and $51,718.77) were lower for procedures performed by surgeons.\nSurgeons are performing the majority of carotid stent procedures in the United States. The volume of cases performed by a provider, rather than the provider's specialty, appears to be a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes for carotid stenting. There were, however, significant cost differences between surgeons and interventionalists, which needs to be further evaluated at an institutional level.",

    "abstract": "Blood transfusions are common among patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Prior studies suggest an association between blood transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The predictors of perioperative transfusion and its impact on patients undergoing vascular surgery have been poorly defined.\nWe examined data from a large multicenter quality improvement vascular surgical registry of all patients undergoing elective or urgent open peripheral arterial disease procedures, endovascular aneurysm repair, or open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair between January 2012 and December 2013. Emergency cases, carotid endarterectomy, and carotid artery stenting were excluded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify predictors of transfusion and association of transfusion with outcomes. All regression models had Hosmer-Lemeshow P > .05 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of >0.8, confirming excellent goodness of fit and discrimination.\nOur study population comprised 2946 patients who underwent open peripheral arterial disease procedures (n\u00a0= 1744), open AAA repair (n\u00a0= 175), or endovascular aneurysm repair (n\u00a0= 1027) at 22 hospitals. The overall transfusion rate was 25%, at a median nadir hemoglobin level of 7.7\u00a0g/dL. Independent factors predicting transfusion included female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.2), nonwhite race (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.2), preoperative admission status (ie, acute care hospital) (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.3), preoperative anemia (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 3.3-5.1), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9), prior myocardial infarction (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.01-1.6), clopidogrel (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8), open AAA repair (OR, 25; 95% CI, 17-39), open bypass (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.7-4.6), and urgent procedures (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8). With adjustment for major covariates, perioperative transfusion was independently associated with death (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.2-15), myocardial infarction (OR, 8; 95% CI, 3.7-17), and pneumonia (OR, 7.4; 95% CI, 3.3-17).\nPerioperative transfusion in vascular surgical patients is independently associated with increased 30-day morbidity and mortality. Given indeterminate causation, these data suggest the need for a prospective transfusion threshold study in vascular surgical patients.",

    "abstract": "Cilostazol is an antiplatelet agent with vasodilatory effects that works by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This study investigated the effects of cilostazol in preventing high glucose (HG)-induced impaired angiogenesis and examined the potential mechanisms involving activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).\nAssays for colony formation, adhesion, proliferation, migration, and vascular tube formation were used to determine the effect of cilostazol in HG-treated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Animal-based assays were performed in hyperglycemic ICR mice undergoing hind limb ischemia. An immnunoblotting assay was used to identify the expression and activation of signaling molecules in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.\nCilostazol treatment significantly restored endothelial function in EPCs and HUVECs through activation of AMPK/acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)-dependent pathways and cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathways. Recovery of blood flow in the ischemic hind limb and the population of circulating CD34(+) cells were significantly improved in cilostazol-treated mice, and these effects were abolished by local AMPK knockdown. Cilostazol increased the phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC and Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling molecules in parallel with or downstream of the cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling pathway in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.\nCilostazol prevents HG-induced endothelial dysfunction in EPCs and HUVECs and enhances angiogenesis in hyperglycemic mice by interactions with a broad signaling network, including activation of AMPK/ACC and probably cAMP/PKA pathways.",

Several studies reported inferior outcomes in women compared with men after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We investigated the relationship between gender and outcomes after EVAR.\nA total of 1380 consecutive patients underwent elective EVAR from 1992 to 2012. Baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative variables by gender were analyzed from a prospective database.\nThe cohort comprised 214 women (15.5%) and 1166 men (84.5%). Women were older than men at repair (77.8 vs 74.5 years, P < .001) and had less cardiac disease (P = .005). They had shorter (19.8 \u00b1 12.9 vs 26.3 \u00b1 14.7 mm; P < .001) more angulated aortic necks (38.8\u00b0 \u00b1 16.1\u00b0 vs 31.2\u00b0 \u00b1 14.7\u00b0; P < .001) and fewer iliac aneurysms (P = .002). Women had more arterial reconstructions (iliac conduits, P = .006; thrombolysis and thrombectomy, P = .013; patch angioplasty, P < .001; endarterectomy, P < .001), more perioperative complications (16.9% vs 9.1%; P = .001), and more in-hospital days (4.1 vs 3.4 days; P = .029). Perioperative mortality was equivalent (women: 2% vs men: 2.3%; P = .73). Mean follow-up was 30.9 months. Women and men experienced equivalent aneurysm-related deaths and overall survival. Survival curve analysis showed endoleaks were more likely to develop in women than men (P = .005); however, there was no difference in rates of arterial reinterventions required for each gender during the follow-up period.\nFemale gender is associated with more periprocedural complications, adjunctive arterial procedures, and increased endoleaks but does not affect long-term reinterventions or survival. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the effect of gender on outcomes. These data should be considered when selecting EVAR for men and women.",

They had shorter (19.8 \u00b1 12.9 vs 26.3 \u00b1 14.7 mm; P < .001) more angulated aortic necks (38.8\u00b0 \u00b1 16.1\u00b0 vs 31.2\u00b0 \u00b1 14.7\u00b0; P < .001) and fewer iliac aneurysms (P = .002). Women had more arterial reconstructions (iliac conduits, P = .006; thrombolysis and thrombectomy, P = .013; patch angioplasty, P < .001; endarterectomy, P < .001), more perioperative complications (16.9% vs 9.1%; P = .001), and more in-hospital days (4.1 vs 3.4 days; P = .029). Perioperative mortality was equivalent (women: 2% vs men: 2.3%; P = .73). Mean follow-up was 30.9 months. Women and men experienced equivalent aneurysm-related deaths and overall survival. Survival curve analysis showed endoleaks were more likely to develop in women than men (P = .005); however, there was no difference in rates of arterial reinterventions required for each gender during the follow-up period.",

    "abstract": "New and efficient strategies to protect endothelium or to enhance endothelial regrowth are important for treatment of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Magnetic DNA microspheres are used to accelerate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) re-endothelialization and to attenuate intimal hyperplasia in balloon-injured artery. This study aimed to assess DNA-gelatin magnetic nanospheres containing VEGF expression plasmids in vascular restenosis attenuation.\nNinety-six rabbits underwent balloon injury and were randomly divided for gene transfer with naked VEGF plasmids (NAK group), magnetic VEGF microspheres (MIC group), and LacZ (CON group: naked LacZ plasmid and LacZ nanosphere subgroups). Serum and tissue VEGF levels were measured. Also, the ratios of intima area to media area were determined to assess neointima formation.\nMicrosphere gene delivery through the artery by a magnet resulted in VEGF overexpression in transfected arterial segments. Tissue VEGF integral optical densities were significantly increased in MIC rabbits compared with NAK animals. Serum VEGF was below detection in all animals. X-Gal staining showed higher transfection efficiency in the CON group. The impact of neointimal thickening was evaluated by light microscopy as the ratio of intima area to media area in cross sections. Significant differences in the ratio of intima area to media area were obtained between the NAK group (0.12 \u00b1 0.02, 0.41 \u00b1 0.03, 0.61 \u00b1 0.05, and 0.72 \u00b1 0.04 at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, respectively) and the MIC group (0.06 \u00b1 0.03, 0.20 \u00b1 0.05, 0.25 \u00b1 0.04, and 0.26 \u00b1 0.03 at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, respectively) at 2, 3, and 4 weeks (P < .05).\nIntra-arterial VEGF gene delivery by magnetic microspheres significantly increased DNA stability, transfection efficiency, and targeting specificity, resulting in exogenous VEGF overexpression and attenuated intimal hyperplasia in balloon-injured artery.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure remains a significant problem with reported early failure rates around 50%. Suboptimal hemodynamics, variable surgical skills, and technique dependency are widely believed to contribute to AVF nonmaturation. The Optiflow (Bioconnect Systems, Ambler, Pa) is a novel anastomotic device placed in situ that has potential for improving hemodynamics and standardizing AVF placement. We report results from a prospective nonrandomized controlled pilot study designed to investigate the safety and performance of the Optiflow.\nForty-one participants underwent AVF formation using either a 3-mm or 4-mm Optiflow and 39 matched control participants underwent AVF formation using the standard technique at two sites. Patients were observed for 90 days after AVF placement. The primary end point was unassisted maturation, which was defined as an outflow vein with a diameter \u22655 mm and blood flow \u2265500 mL/min measured by Doppler ultrasound. The secondary performance end point was unassisted patency, and the primary safety end point was freedom from device-related serious adverse events.\nUnassisted maturation rates at 14, 42, and 90 days were 76%, 72%, and 68%, respectively, for the Optiflow group and 67%, 68%, and 76%, respectively, in the control group (P = .38, .69, and .47 at 14, 42, and 90 days). There was a trend to earlier maturation (assessed at 14 days) in the 4-mm Optiflow group compared with the control group (P = .059). There were no device-related serious adverse events.\nMaturation results for both the Optiflow and control groups were highly favorable compared with historical assisted maturation rates of approximately 50%. The Optiflow appears to be safe and effective in the placement of AVFs, with high maturation rates.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to study associations between clinical variables, demographic factors, and outcome after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nData of consecutive patients who underwent EVAR between 1997 and 2011 at a tertiary center were analyzed. Comorbidity scores stratified patients into low/normal-risk (score \u2264 10) or high-risk categories (score > 10). The primary end point was mortality; secondary end points were morbidities, reinterventions, conversions, and ruptures.\nThe study included 934 patients, 117 women (13%) and 817 men (87%) (mean age, 76 \u00b1 7.3 years; range, 51-99 years). There were 870 (93%) asymptomatic, 36 (3.9%) symptomatic, and 28 (3.0%) ruptured AAAs. The 30-day mortality was 1.4% (13 of 934), 1.0% (9 of 870) for asymptomatic patients, 2.8% (1 of 36) for patients with symptomatic AAAs, and 11% (3 of 28) for patients with ruptured AAAs (P = .004). Clinical presentation with symptoms or rupture was associated with more complications (P = .02), reinterventions (P = .003), and a lower 5-year survival (P = .04). Association between surgical risk, female gender, age, and outcome was studied in 870 asymptomatic patients. Both 30-day mortality and complication rates were higher for high-risk vs low/normal-risk patients (2.3% vs 0.2%, P = .003; 15% vs 10%, P = .04); reintervention rates were equivalent (3.8% vs 4.4%; P = .67). The 30-day mortality and complication rates were similar in women and men (2.8% vs 0.8%, P = .09; 17% vs 11%, P = .11), but reintervention rate was higher in women (8.5% vs 3.5%; P = .02). Follow-up averaged 3.8 years (1 month-13.5 years). In asymptomatic patients, 5-year survival was 74% for low/normal-risk patients and 54% for high-risk patients (P < .001); both had similar rates of freedom from complications (65% vs 63%; P = .24), reinterventions (71% vs 75%; P = .36), or rupture (99.3% vs 99.7%; P = .42). Women had more complications (47% vs 34%; P = .04) and reinterventions than men did (39% vs 26%; P = .02); freedom from rupture was the same (100% vs 99.3%; P = .30). There were eight ruptures, all in asymptomatic patients. In multivariate analysis, high surgical risk and age were associated with all-cause mortality (P < .001); female gender was associated with complications and reinterventions (P < .05) but not mortality.\nClinical presentation predicts early mortality and complications, age predicts both early and late mortalities after EVAR. Although women had an increased rate of complications and reinterventions, women did not have significantly higher mortality than men.",

    "abstract": "Combined vascular reconstruction and free flap transfer has been established in centers as a feasible therapeutic option in cases with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and large tissue defects otherwise destined for major amputation. However, the number of patients treated with this combined approach is limited, and data regarding long-term follow-up and functional outcome are scarce. We therefore report our 10-year experience in free flap transplantation after vascular reconstruction as a last attempt for limb salvage, with special emphasis of complication rate, limb salvage, and postoperative mobility.\nCLI patients undergoing combined vascular reconstruction and consequent free flap transfer from 2003 to 2013 were retrospectively observed. Of 80 cases in total, patients with traumatic and oncologic indications were excluded; 33 (mean age, 66 years; range, 51-82 years) of these cases were performed for limb salvage and were included in this study. Long-term follow-up was possible in 32 of 33 patients (mean, 58 months; range, 2-126 months).\nThirty-three patients were analyzed. We performed arterial revascularization with 9 arteriovenous loops, 23 bypass grafts (10 popliteal-pedal, 9 femoral-crural, and 4 femoral-popliteal), and 1 venous interposition graft. For defect coverage, tissue transfer was comprised of six different flap entities (10 latissimus dorsi, 2 gracilis, 1 anterior lateral thigh, 7 rectus abdominis, 11 radialis, and 2 greater omentum flaps). Complications occurred in 16 of 33 patients (49%). Early complications included eight acute occlusions of arterial reconstructions; major bleedings were seen in eight patients as well. There were two flap losses and one major amputation in the early postoperative period. No in-hospital deaths were observed. Late results revealed a limb salvage rate of 87% after 1 year and 83% after 5 years. Amputation-free survival was 87% after 1 year and 75% after 5 years. Overall survival was 100% and 87% after 1 year and 5 years, respectively. Follow-up showed 42% of patients with no limitations in ambulation, 54% with maintained preoperative ambulatory status, and one bedridden patient.\nThe combined approach for limb salvage in CLI patients is associated with excellent results in limb salvage and functional outcome in patients who would otherwise be candidates for major amputation, despite an initially elevated complication rate. The option of combined revascularization with free tissue transfer should be evaluated in all mobile patients with CLI, large tissue defects, and exposed tendon or bone structures before major amputation. However, further studies are required to support these results.",

We performed arterial revascularization with 9 arteriovenous loops, 23 bypass grafts (10 popliteal-pedal, 9 femoral-crural, and 4 femoral-popliteal), and 1 venous interposition graft. For defect coverage, tissue transfer was comprised of six different flap entities (10 latissimus dorsi, 2 gracilis, 1 anterior lateral thigh, 7 rectus abdominis, 11 radialis, and 2 greater omentum flaps). Complications occurred in 16 of 33 patients (49%). Early complications included eight acute occlusions of arterial reconstructions; major bleedings were seen in eight patients as well. There were two flap losses and one major amputation in the early postoperative period. No in-hospital deaths were observed. Late results revealed a limb salvage rate of 87% after 1 year and 83% after 5 years. Amputation-free survival was 87% after 1 year and 75% after 5 years. Overall survival was 100% and 87% after 1 year and 5 years, respectively. Follow-up showed 42% of patients with no limitations in ambulation, 54% with maintained preoperative ambulatory status, and one bedridden patient.",

    "abstract": "In 2008, the top priority in our division's 5-year strategic plan was \"to become an internationally recognized center of excellence for the endovascular treatment of complex aortic pathology extending from the aortic valve to the external iliac artery.\" Five components were identified as \"most critical\" to achieve this strategic priority: (1) training at centers of excellence in complex endovascular repair; (2) industry partnership to improve access to developing technologies; (3) a fully integrated team approach with one leader involved in all steps of all cases; (4) prospective data collection; and (5) development and implementation of a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption for juxtarenal, pararenal, and thoracoabdominal aneurysms. We have now performed 49 repairs (16 commercially manufactured devices, 33 physician-modified devices) for 3 common iliac, 20 juxtarenal, 9 pararenal, and 17 thoracoabdominal aneurysms, using 142 fenestrations, branches, and scallops. All patients had complete 30-day follow-up for calculation of 30-day events. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate 1-year events. In 5 years, we developed a successful complex endovascular aortic program that uses fenestrated/branched repair techniques. A focused team strategic planning approach to program development is an effective way for vascular surgery divisions to gain experience and expertise with new complex technologies while ensuring acceptable patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Use of fluoroscopy and bone landmarks to guide percutaneous common femoral artery (CFA) access has decreased access site complications compared with palpation alone. However, only limited case series have examined the benefits of ultrasound to guide CFA access during peripheral vascular intervention (PVI). We evaluated the effect of routine vs selective use of ultrasound guidance (UG) on groin hematoma rates after PVI.\nThe Vascular Study Group of New England database (2010-2014) was queried to identify the complication of postprocedural groin hematoma after 7359 PVIs performed through CFA access. Hematoma (including pseudoaneurysms) was defined as minor (requiring compression or observation), moderate (requiring transfusion or thrombin injection), and major (requiring operation). Both procedure-level and interventionalist-level analyses were performed. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to compare hematoma rates of interventionalists based on routine (\u226580% of PVIs) and selective (<80%) utilization of UG in the adjusted overall sample and in multiple subgroups.\nThe overall postprocedural groin hematoma rate after PVI was 4.5%, and the rate of combined moderate and major hematoma was 0.8%. Among 114 interventionalists with \u226510 PVI procedures, routine and selective UG was used by 31 (27%) and 83 (73%) interventionalists, respectively. Routine UG was protective against hematoma (rate ratio [RR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.84; P < .01). Subgroup analysis revealed that routine UG was also protective against hematoma under the following circumstances: age >80 years (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.85; P = .01), body mass index \u226530 (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; P = .02), and sheath size >6F (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.79; P < .01).\nRoutine UG may potentially protect against the complication of hematoma for both modifiable and nonmodifiable patient and procedural characteristics. Encouraging routine UG is a feasible quality improvement opportunity to decrease patient morbidity after PVI.",

Early experience was defined as the first 50 patients treated at each center. Data from early and late experience were retrospectively analyzed and compared for differences in operative results and 1-year outcomes.\nEarly experience covered 4.7 years in Malm\u00f6 and 4.5 years in Lille; late experience covered 5.6 years in Malm\u00f6 and 3.7 years in Lille. A total of 288 patients were included. In the later phase, stent graft configuration was more complex because of increased number of fenestrations/scallops incorporated in the graft design (2.7 \u00b1 0.8 vs 3.2 \u00b1 0.7; P < .001). Despite this, volume of contrast material and radiation time decreased by 27% and 20%, respectively, whereas procedure time remained unchanged. At 1 year, a trend toward decreasing abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter was observed in the late group, but no differences were found in mortality, endoleaks, or target vessel patency between the groups.\nWith increasing experience, fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair design has become more complicated, with more visceral vessels targeted for better proximal seal, while operative risk still remains low. Simultaneously, radiation time and volume of contrast material have been reduced, with possible long-term benefits for the patient.",

Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT), followed by a split-thickness skin graft (STSG), can be a cost-effective alternative to this standard care. We performed a cost analysis of these two treatments.\nA retrospective review was performed of 10 ulcers treated with surgical debridement, 7 days of inpatient NPWT with topical antiseptic instillation (NPWTi), and STSG, with 4 additional days of inpatient NPWT bolster over the graft. Independent medical cost estimators were used to compare the cost of this treatment protocol with standard outpatient compression therapy.\nThe average length of time ulcers were present before patients entered the study was 38 months (range, 3-120 months). Eight of 10 patients had complete VLU closure by 6 months after NPWTi with STSG. The 6-month costs of the proposed treatment protocol and standard twice-weekly compression therapy were estimated to be $27,000 and $28,000, respectively.\nNPWTi with STSG treatment is more effective for closure of massive VLUs at 6 months than that reported for standard compression therapy. Further, the cost of the proposed treatment protocol is comparable with standard compression therapy.",

Among them, 1999 patients (8.7%) used cilostazol before LER. More patients received endovascular (14,353) than open (8601) procedures. Cilostazol users had fewer amputations than nonusers at 30 days (7.8% vs 13.4%), 90 days (10.7% vs 18.0%), and 1 year (14.8% vs 24.0%; P < .0001 for all). Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for age, gender, race, comorbidities, type of procedure, and atherosclerosis severity showed noncilostazol users were more likely to undergo amputation \u22641 year after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.29; P = .02). Subgroup analyses using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidities demonstrated significantly improved 1-year amputation-free survival for patients with renal failure (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.28-2.02; P < .001) and diabetes (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.36-1.92; P < .001) who were taking cilostazol.",

    "abstract": "In our prior study, we showed that delta-opioid peptide [D-Ala(2), D-Leu(5)] enkephalin (DADLE), by regional perfusion into the abdominal aorta, could protect the spinal cord against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury caused by aortic occlusion. However, the relative dose-response effects of DADLE still remain unclear. This study investigated whether DADLE has a dose-dependent efficiency on spinal cord I/R injury.\nNew Zealand White rabbits were randomly divided into one of six groups: normal saline (NS; n\u00a0= 8), DADLE (D) groups D0.0005 (n\u00a0= 8), D0.005 (n\u00a0= 8), D0.05 (n\u00a0= 8), and D0.5\u00a0mg/kg (n\u00a0= 8), and a sham group (n\u00a0= 6). In the NS and DADLE groups, spinal cord ischemia was induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion for 30\u00a0minutes. During the occlusion, the same volume of NS or DADLE at the indicated doses was infused continuously through a catheter to the distally clamped abdominal aorta. Heart rate, blood pressure, and core temperature were monitored continuously to evaluate the potential adverse effects of DADLE. Neurologic behavioral function was assessed with the Tarlov scale system at 1, 6, 24, 48, and 72\u00a0hours after reperfusion. Neuronal injury evaluation in the ventral horn of the gray matter was evaluated by counting the normal motor neurons at 72\u00a0hours after reperfusion.\nThe therapeutic benefits increased at the doses of DADLE from 0.0005 to 0.05\u00a0mg/kg and decreased at 0.5\u00a0mg/kg, whereas the hemodynamic parameter was suppressed temporarily at the dose of 0.5\u00a0mg/kg.\nThese data revealed that regional administration of DADLE through the abdominal aorta provided dose-dependent protection on spinal cord I/R in rabbits.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a burdensome cardiovascular condition that results from chronic inflammatory insults to the arterial vasculature. Key risk factors include age, gender, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, smoking, lack of physical fitness, and poor diet, the latter three being modifiable in the development and progression of PAD. A growing body of evidence indicates that imbalanced nutrient intake may contribute to the development and progression of PAD. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about nutritional patterns among patients with PAD and to ascertain whether certain health-promoting foods and nutrients could benefit patients with this condition.\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine primary source evidence for or against the nutrients that are commonly associated with PAD and their potential utility as therapies.\nWe summarized nine categories of nutrients, as well as four diets endorsed by the American Heart Association that may be prescribed to patients with or at risk for PAD. The nutrients reviewed included omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), folate and B-series vitamins, and antioxidants. The diet plans described include the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, Mediterranean diet, low-fat diet, low carbohydrate diet, Dr Dean Ornish's Spectrum Diet and Dr Andrew Weil's Anti-Inflammatory Diet.\nPAD is a chronic inflammatory condition that is associated with longstanding poor nutrition habits. We advocate for an intensified use of diet in PAD therapy, and we specifically recommend following eating patterns that are rich in nutrients with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.",

    "abstract": "This study reviewed the current developments in manual tracking and robotic navigation technologies for application in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nEMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched for studies reporting manual tracking or robotic navigation systems that are able to manipulate endovascular surgical tools during abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. Reports were grouped by the navigation systems and categorized into phantom, animal, and clinical studies. First, the general characteristics of each system were compared. Second, target registration error and deployment error were used to compare the accuracy of the tracking systems. Third, all systems were reviewed for fluoroscopy time (FT), radiation dose, and contrast volumes, if reported, in rigid and nonrigid studies. Fourth, vascular cannulation performance of the systems was compared, studying cannulation time, Imperial College Complex Cannulation Scoring Tool score, and the number of wall hits and catheter movements within rigid studies.\nOf 721 articles and references found, 18 studies of four different navigation systems were included: the Aurora (Northern Digital, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) tracking system, the StealthStation (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) tracking system, an ultrasound localization tracking system, and the Sensei (Hansen Medical, Mountain View, Calif) steerable remote-controlled robotic navigation system. The mean tracking accuracy averaged 1 mm for the three manual tracking systems measured in a rigid environment. An increase of target registration error reaching >3 mm was reported when measured in a nonrigid experimental environment or due to external distortion factors. Except within small-animal studies or case studies, no evidence was found on reduction of clinical outcome parameters, such as FT, radiation dose, and contrast volumes, within clinical EVAR. A comparison of vascular cannulation performance in rigid studies revealed that the Sensei robotic system might have an advantage during advanced cannulation compared with standard cannulation within complex cannulations tasks.\nThis review summarizes the current studies on manual tracking and robotic navigation systems for application in EVAR. The main focus of these systems is improving aortic vessel cannulation, required in complex EVAR, in which the robotic system with the improved steerability is favored over manual tracking systems or conventional cannulation. All reviewed tracking systems still require X-ray for anatomic imaging, stent graft deployment, and device registration. Although the current reviewed endovascular navigation systems have shown their potential in phantom and animal studies, clinical trials are too limited to conclude that these systems can improve EVAR outcomes or that they can systematically reduce FTs, radiation doses, and contrast volumes during (complex) EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Lifelong imaging follow-up is essential to the safe and appropriate management of patients who undergo endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). We sought to evaluate the rate of compliance with imaging follow-up after EVAR and to identify factors associated with being lost to imaging follow-up.\nWe identified a 20% sample of continuously enrolled Medicare beneficiaries who underwent EVAR between 2001 and 2008. Using data through 2010 from Medicare Inpatient, Outpatient, and Carrier files, we identified all abdominal imaging studies that may have been performed for EVAR follow-up. Patients were considered lost to annual imaging follow-up if they did not undergo any abdominal imaging study within their last 2 years of follow-up. Multivariable models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with being lost to annual imaging follow-up.\nAmong 19,962 patients who underwent EVAR, the incidence of loss to annual imaging follow-up at 5 years after EVAR was 50%. Primary factors associated with being lost to annual imaging follow-up were advanced age (age 65-69 years, reference; age 75-79 years: hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.32; age 80-85 years: HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.35-1.55; age >85 years: HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.88-2.20) and presentation with an urgent/emergent intact aneurysm (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20-1.35) or ruptured aneurysm (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.63-2.08). Additional independent factors included several previously diagnosed chronic diseases and South and West regions of the United States.\nAnnual imaging follow-up compliance after EVAR in the United States is significantly below recommended levels. Quality improvement efforts to encourage improved compliance with imaging follow-up, especially in older patients with multiple comorbidities and in those who underwent EVAR urgently or for rupture, are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Despite increased awareness of the value of discussing patients' goals of care, advance directives, and code status as part of the surgical informed consent process, the actual outcomes and risks of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remain poorly defined among some subsets of surgical patients. Thus, in an effort to generate an evidence base for communication about shared decision making and informed consent for vascular surgery patients and their surrogates, we defined the incidence, risks, and outcomes of postoperative cardiac arrest after primary vascular surgery procedures.\nThe 2007 to 2010 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data were queried to develop a multi-institutional database of patients undergoing vascular surgery (N = 123,581). Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify crude and adjusted risk factors for postoperative cardiac arrest requiring CPR and to assess outcomes.\nPostoperative cardiac arrest requiring CPR was seen in 1234 of 123,581 patients (1.0%) after vascular surgery at a mean of 7.2 \u00b1 2 days. The 30-day mortality was 73.4% compared with 2.7% among patients who did not arrest (P < .001). Of CPR survivors, 102 (12.1%) were still hospitalized at 30 days. Patient variables that were most predictive of postoperative cardiac arrest included dependent functional status (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.6; P < .001), dialysis dependence (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3-3.2; P < .001), emergent case (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-2.5; P < .001), and preoperative ventilator dependence (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7; P < .001). Procedures associated with the highest risk included thoracic aortic surgery (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 4.8-9.9; P < .001), open abdominal procedures (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.1-4.4; P < .001), axillary-femoral bypass (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.2; P = .001), and peripheral embolectomy (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9; P = .002). At least one major complication preceded cardiac arrest in 47.7% of patients including sepsis (23.5%), renal failure (14.5%), and myocardial infarction (12.1%). Patients with do not resuscitate orders were significantly less likely to undergo CPR (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.93; P = .021).\nPatients undergoing vascular surgery who suffer a postoperative cardiac arrest frequently die in spite of receiving CPR; for those who survive, there is likely to be prolonged hospitalization and significant morbidity. These data provide an evidence base for discussing goals of care, advance directives, and code status with vascular surgery patients and their surrogates. Further research into how to best communicate risk, to elicit patient preferences, and to engage in shared decision making is needed.",

The long-term outcomes of FEVAR are largely unknown, and there is no Level I comparative evidence. This systematic review and meta-analysis of case series compares elective juxtarenal aneurysm surgery by open repair and FEVAR.\nA systematic literature search was conducted for all published studies on elective repair of juxtarenal aneurysms by FEVAR and open repair. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from 1947 to April 2013. The exclusion criteria were case series of <10 patients or ruptured aneurysms. The primary outcomes were perioperative mortality and postoperative renal insufficiency. The secondary outcomes were secondary reinterventions and long-term survival.\nWe identified 35 case series with data on 2326 patients. Perioperative mortality was 4.1% in open repair and FEVAR case series (odds ratio for open repair with FEVAR, 1.059; 95% confidence interval, 0.642-1.747; P = .822). Postoperative renal insufficiency was not significantly different (odds ratio for open repair with FEVAR, 1.136; 95% confidence interval, 0.754-1.713; P = .542). FEVAR patients had higher rates of secondary reintervention, renal impairment during follow-up, and a lower long-term survival compared with open repair patients.\nFEVAR and open repair have similar short-term outcomes but have diverging long-term outcomes that may be secondary to the selection bias of FEVAR being offered to high-risk patients. FEVAR is a favorable option in high-risk patients, and open repair remains viable as the gold standard.",

    "abstract": "Prior analysis in the Open vs Endovascular Repair Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study (CSP #498) demonstrated that survival, quality of life, and total health care costs are not significantly different between the open and endovascular methods of repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The device is a major cost of this method of repair, and the objective of this study was to evaluate the costs of the device, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and total health care costs when different endograft systems are selected for the endovascular repair (EVR). Within each selected system, EVR costs are compared with open repair costs.\nThe study randomized 881 patients to open (n = 437) or EVR (n = 444). Device selection was recorded before randomization; therefore, open repair controls were matched to each device cohort. Data were excluded for two low-volume devices, implanted in only 13 individuals, leaving 423 control and 431 endovascular patients: 166 Zenith (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), 177 Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), and 88 AneuRx (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn). Mean device, hospitalization, and total health care costs from randomization to 2 years were compared. Health care utilization data were obtained from patients and national VA and Medicare data sources. VA costs were determined using methods previously developed by the VA Health Economics Resource Center. Non-VA costs were obtained from Medicare claims data and billing data from the patient's health care providers.\nImplant costs were 38% of initial hospitalization costs. Mean device (range, $13,600-$14,400), initial hospitalization (range, $34,800-$38,900), and total health care costs at 2 years in the endovascular (range, $72,400-$78,200) and open repair groups (range, $75,600-$82,100) were not significantly different among device systems. Differences between endovascular and corresponding open repair cohorts showed lower mean costs for EVR (range, $3200-$8300), but these were not statistically different.\nThe implant costs of endovascular aneurysm repair are substantial. When evaluating total health care system expenditures, there is large individual variability in costs, and there is no significant difference at 2 years among systems or when an individual system is compared with open repair.",

The iliac arteries were also more prone to expansion during the first postoperative month (right iliac, 0.95 \u00b1 0.08 mm/month; left iliac, 0.91 \u00b1 0.08 mm/month) and in the next 6 months with a monthly expansion rate of 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 mm and 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 mm for the right and left iliac arteries, respectively. Remodeling of the aneurysm sac occurred mainly in the first postoperative year with a regression rate of 0.89 \u00b1 0.05 mm/month between 1 and 6 months and 0.44 \u00b1 0.04 mm/month for the second half of the year. The aneurysm sac regression rate dropped to 0.2 mm/month in the second postoperative year. Changes in the aortic neck diameter were statistically significant (P < .001) only at the 24- to 36-month postoperative interval. Changes in the aortic sac diameter were statistically significant (P < .001) at the 30-day to 6-month, 6- to 12-month, and 12- to 24-month intervals. Among patients who underwent reintervention, aortic sac expansion occurred primarily in the 24- to 36-month interval.\nExpansion of the aortic neck after EVAR for the Zenith endograft occurs mainly between 24 and 36 months; aortic aneurysm sac regression occurs more obviously at 1 to 12 months. Iliac arteries at the landing zone expand more rapidly in the first postoperative year. Late surveillance of EVAR patients is essential to avoid late complications after aortic remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Surgical dogma holds that chemotherapy increases the risk of aneurysm growth and rupture. We sought to determine the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on the growth of aortic aneurysms.\nAll patients undergoing chemotherapy for malignancy with coexisting aortic aneurysms at our institution between 2000 and 2011 were identified. Review of electronic medical records and rereview of serial cross-sectional imaging was performed. An additional cohort of patients undergoing aneurysm surveillance during the same period was identified, and demographic and anatomic variables were collected. Planned analysis included descriptive analysis, change in aneurysm diameter over time, and association of growth or need for intervention with type of chemotherapy and type of malignancy.\nBetween 2000 and 2011, 125 patients at our institution had a concurrent diagnosis of aortic aneurysm and malignancy requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cross-sectional imaging was available for 91 patients. The predominant malignancy type was lung cancer (34 of 91 [38%]), followed by lymphoma (21 of 91 [23%]) and colorectal cancer (10 of 91 [11%]). Most aneurysms were infrarenal (53 of 91 [58%]). Most patients were treated with more than one class of chemotherapeutic agent over 267 days (interquartile range [IQR], 144-469 days), and most had at least one cycle of alkylating agents (73 of 91), in addition to antimetabolites (42 of 91) and plant alkaloids/terpenoids (40 of 92). Chemotherapy regimens included steroids in 84 patients (92%). The baseline aneurysm diameter was 41.4 mm (IQR, 34.9-51.3 mm) for patients who received chemotherapeutic agents and 46.0 mm (IQR, 40-52 mm) for those who did not. Eight of the 91 patients (9%) underwent aneurysm repair during chemotherapy, but only two required urgent repair due to aneurysm rupture. The rate of aneurysm growth per year for patients who did and did not receive chemotherapy was similar at 2.3 mm vs 2.4 mm (P = .69).\nIn 91 patients over 10 years at our institution, chemotherapy did not increase aneurysm growth compared with patients not undergoing treatment for malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Although the need for intraoperative shunting during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is intensely debated, relatively few studies have compared the neurologic outcomes of patients undergoing CEA with or without shunts. The objective of our analysis was to determine the impact of intraoperative shunting during CEA on the incidence of postoperative stroke.\nThe 2012 CEA-targeted American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used for this analysis. The preoperative and operative characteristics of patients undergoing CEA with or without intraoperative shunting were compared. From this overall sample, propensity score techniques were then used to match patients with or without intraoperative shunting for a number of variables, including age, degree of ipsilateral and contralateral carotid stenosis, presence of several anatomic or physiologic risk factors, anesthesia modality, and use of patch angioplasty vs primary arteriotomy closure. The 30-day postoperative mortality and combined stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) rates of this matched cohort were then compared. A similar analysis was also performed on a subgroup of patients with severe stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery.\nA total of 3153 patients were included for initial analysis (2023 \"no-shunt\" patients vs 1130 \"shunt\" patients). From this overall sample, propensity score matching yielded a cohort of 1072 patients with or without intraoperative shunt placement who were well matched for all known patient- and procedure-related factors. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative stroke/TIA between the two groups of this matched cohort (3.4% in the no-shunt group vs 3.7% in the shunt group; P = .64). Analysis of a similarly well matched subgroup of patients with severe stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery demonstrated a statistically nonsignificant increase in the incidence of postoperative stroke/TIA with the use of intraoperative shunting (4.9% in the no-shunt group vs 9.8% in the shunt group; P = .08).\nThere is no clinical benefit to intraoperative shunting during CEA, even in patients who may be at high risk for intraoperative cerebral hypoperfusion due to severe stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery.",

In the current retrospective study, we reviewed the clinical data of hemodialysis patients who underwent AVF reconstruction by VNH stripping. The primary measure of interest was the secondary patency rate of the restored AVF.\nThe study included hemodialysis patients who underwent AVF reconstruction by VNH stripping (group A), AVF reconstruction proximal to the original fistula (group B), or creation of a new AVF (group C). Patency was evaluated immediately after the surgery and at follow-up visits.\nOf 353 patients who underwent AVF reconstructions, 327 (91.9%) were for late AVF failure. The final analysis included 305 patients: 76, 128, and 101 patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The three groups were comparable in age, sex, causes for AVF, AVF sites, and the artery for the AVF (P > .05). At 3-month follow-up, the secondary AVF patency rate was comparable across the three groups at 93.4%, 92.2%, and 92.1% in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The patency rate at 6 and 12 months was also comparable across groups A, B, and C at 89.5%, 89.8%, and 88.1% at 6 months and 84.2%, 85.9%, and 81.2% at 12 months, respectively.\nReconstructing the AVF by surgically removing VNH is an effective technique for late hemodialysis access failure, with maximal preservation of blood vessels.",

Analysis identified 19 elective patients with short (<10 mm) proximal necks and mild angulations (\u226445\u00b0) treated with the Endurant stent graft and 38 patients matched for age, sex, and aneurysm diameter with proximal aortic necks \u226510 mm in length who met the instructions for use. End points included technical and clinical success and freedom from any secondary intervention, any type of endoleak, and aneurysm-related death.\nThe short-neck group was a mean \u00b1 standard deviation age of 71.7 \u00b1 8.9 years, 84% were men, and their mean infrarenal aortic neck length was 6.1 \u00b1 1.2 mm.

Aortic neck diameters were similar between the groups (26.6 \u00b1 3.8 vs 25.7 \u00b1 3.7 mm; P = .36). Primary technical success was achieved in all cases. Off-label patients were more likely to require additional proximal cuff deployment to successfully obtain a seal (21% vs 3%; P = .04).

We reviewed our experience with arteriovenous access surgery in all hemodialysis patients aged 80 years and older to determine if this approach is justified in terms of patency and life expectancy.\nA retrospective study was made of all patients aged 80 years and older who had surgery from January 2005 to December 2009 at our national vascular access referral center. All patients had preoperative mapping and had fistula construction if the vein size was at least 3 mm. Otherwise they had brachiobasilic or brachioaxillary grafts. All patients had routine access surveillance by Doppler ultrasound (duplex) and physical examination at regular intervals, and interventions were carried out according to the findings. Type of access, success rate, maturation, primary and secondary patency, and patient survival in the age group older than 80 years were noted.\nDuring the study period, 134 patients had 146 new accesses. There were 128 autogenous accesses (30 forearm, 91 upper arm, and seven transposed basilic veins) and 18 prosthetic accesses. Overall primary patency was 39%, 33%, and 23% at 12, 24, and 36 months. Secondary patency was 92%, 83%, and 77% at 12, 24, and 36 months. There was no significant difference in patency between the different types of accesses and between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Eleven upper arm and four forearm fistulas had delayed maturation or nonmaturation. The relative risk for delayed maturation or nonmaturation of forearm fistulas (13.3%) compared with brachial-cephalic fistula (12.1%) was 1.1030 (95% confidence interval, 0.3973-3.204; P = .8571). Median patient survival was 38 months, with 49 dying during follow-up.\nContrary to recent recommendations favoring grafts for hemodialysis in patients older than 80 years, most elderly patients in this study were found to have vasculature that was suitable for autogenous access construction, with patency rates similar to those of their younger counterparts when adequate preoperative planning and postoperative maintenance were carried out. Age alone should not disqualify patients older than 80 years from access surgery for hemodialysis, nor should age disqualify these patients from the Fistula First Initiative.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is an alternative to open repair in patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms who are neither fit nor suitable for standard open or endovascular repair. Chimney and snorkel grafts are other endovascular alternatives but frequently require bilateral upper extremity access that has been associated with a 3% to 10% risk of stroke. However, upper extremity access is also frequently required for FEVAR because of the caudal orientation of the visceral vessels. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of upper extremity access for FEVAR and the associated morbidity.\nDuring a 5-year period, 148 patients underwent FEVAR, and upper extremity access for FEVAR was used in 98 (66%). Outcomes were compared between those who underwent upper extremity access and those who underwent femoral access alone. The primary end point was a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and the secondary end point was local access site complications. The mean number of fenestrated vessels was 3.07 \u00b1 0.81 (median, 3) for a total of 457 vessels stented. Percutaneous upper extremity access was used in 12 patients (12%) and open access in 86 (88%). All patients who required a sheath size >7F underwent high brachial open access, with the exception of one patient who underwent percutaneous axillary access with a 12F sheath. The mean sheath size was 10.59F \u00b1 2.51F (median, 12F), which was advanced into the descending thoracic aorta, allowing multiple wire and catheter exchanges.\nOne hemorrhagic stroke (one of 98 [1%]) occurred in the upper extremity access group, and one ischemic stroke (one of 54 [2%]) occurred in the femoral-only access group (P = .67). The stroke in the upper extremity access group occurred 5 days after FEVAR and was related to uncontrolled hypertension, whereas the stroke in the femoral group occurred on postoperative day 3. Neither patient had signs or symptoms of a stroke immediately after FEVAR. The right upper extremity was accessed six times without a stroke (0%) compared with the left being accessed 92 times with one stroke (1%; P = .8). Four patients (4%) had local complications related to upper extremity access. One (1%) required exploration for an expanding hematoma after manual compression for a 7F sheath, one (1%) required exploration for hematoma and neurologic symptoms after open access for a 12F sheath, and two patients (2%) with small hematomas did not require intervention. Two (two of 12 [17%]) of these complications were in the percutaneous access group, which were significantly more frequent than in the open group (two of 86 [2%]; P = .02).\nUpper extremity access appears to be a safe and feasible approach for patients undergoing FEVAR. Open exposure in the upper extremity may be safer than percutaneous access during FEVAR. Unlike chimney and snorkel grafts, upper extremity access during FEVAR is not associated with an increased risk of stroke, despite the need for multiple visceral vessel stenting.",

We explored the association of inflammation to maximal walking time (MWT) in patients with claudication.\nCirculating inflammatory biomarkers, including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM), were measured in 75 subjects with intermittent claudication as well as in 43 healthy subjects. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, interferon-\u03b3, and CD36 from peripheral blood monocytes. Treadmill testing was performed in PAD subjects to assess MWT.\nCompared with healthy subjects, PAD subjects had higher levels of circulating TNF-\u03b1 (P < .0001), CRP (P = .003), sICAM (P < .0001), and IL-6 (P < .0001). Expression of both IL-6 (P = .024) and CD36 (P = .018) was greater in PAD subjects than in healthy subjects.

We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of the three groups.\nThe DTEVAR group had a greater percentage of patients with preoperative comorbidities.

In overall midterm survival, the DTEVAR group had a lower survival rate (63.9% 3-year survival) compared with the CTAR (90.1% 7-year survival) and the TARET TEVAR (95.5% 2.5-year survival) groups. In elective cases, better midterm results were observed in CTAR and TARET TEVAR groups. An increased number of debranching graft and emergency operations resulted in a much lower follow-up survival rate in the DTEVAR group. Atherosclerotic disease had a great effect on midterm outcomes in the DTEVAR (P = .045) and CTAR groups (P = .002).\nThe clinical feasibility of DTEVAR for high-risk patients requiring zone 0 landing or emergency surgery is still controversial.

    "abstract": "The value of prophylactic atropine use during carotid artery stenting (CAS) in primary carotid stenosis to prevent procedural hemodynamic depression is well accepted. However, its impact in case of recurrent stenosis after eversion carotid endarterectomy (E-CEA), which is known to be associated with decreased baroreflex function due to discontinuation of the carotid sinus nerve, has not been investigated so far.\nThe influence of angioplasty in the carotid bulb on intraprocedural and periprocedural hemodynamic changes (heart rate [HR], systolic blood pressure [SP], and diastolic blood pressure [DP]) of 38 CAS procedures (primary stenosis group, n = 16; post-E-CEA recurrent stenosis group, n = 22) was analyzed retrospectively. A single dose of 0.5 mg of atropine was administered in all cases immediately before angioplasty. Periprocedural vasoactive management was documented. Within-group differences were analyzed by the nonparametric Friedman test with pairwise comparisons following the method of Conover.\nIntraprocedural within-group comparison between the median of the 15-minute period before angioplasty and each of three single measure points with 5-minute intervals after angioplasty showed a significant decrease in almost all measures for the primary stenosis group (HR: P = .002, .0008, .08; SP: P = .005, .01, .01; DP: P = .04, .04, .01) and the opposite for the post-E-CEA stenosis group (HR: P < .0001, <.0001, <.0001; SP: P = .04, .03, .05; DP: P = .23, .06, .005).

    "abstract": "After endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), the Society for Vascular Surgery recommends a computed tomography (CT) scan \u226430 days, followed by annual imaging. We sought to describe long-term adherence to surveillance guidelines among United States Medicare beneficiaries and determine patient and hospital factors associated with incomplete surveillance.\nWe analyzed fee-for-service Medicare claims for patients receiving EVAR from 2002 to 2005 and collected all relevant postoperative imaging through 2011. Additional data included patient comorbidities and demographics, yearly hospital volume of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and Medicaid eligibility. Allowing a grace period of 3 months, complete surveillance was defined as at least one CT or ultrasound assessment every 15 months after EVAR. Incomplete surveillance was categorized as gaps for intervals >15 months between consecutive images as or lost to follow-up if >15 months elapsed after the last imaging.\nOur cohort comprised 9695 patients. Median follow-up duration was 6.1 years. A CT scan \u226430 days of EVAR was performed in 3085 (31.8%) patients and \u226460 days in 60.8%. The median time to the postoperative CT was 38 days (interquartile range, 25-98 days). Complete surveillance was observed in 4169 patients (43.0%). For this group, the mean follow-up time was shorter than for those with incomplete surveillance (3.4 \u00b1 2.74 vs 6.5 \u00b1 2.1 years; P < .001). Among those with incomplete surveillance, follow-up became incomplete at 3.3 \u00b1 1.9 years, with 57.6% lost to follow-up, 64.1% with gaps in follow-up (mean gap length, 760 \u00b1 325 days), and 37.6% with both. A multivariable analysis showed incomplete surveillance was independently associated with Medicaid eligibility (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-1.55; P < .001), low-volume hospitals (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20; P < .001), and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.24-1.84; P < .001).\nPostoperative imaging after EVAR is highly variable, and less than half of patients meet current surveillance guidelines. Additional studies are necessary to determine if variability in postoperative surveillance affects long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow cell therapy (BMCT) for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a potential treatment in candidates with poor options for standard revascularization procedures. Whereas clinical trials are ongoing, there are few comparative data to assess its efficacy compared with bypass.\nPatients with poor revascularization options underwent BMCT between 2011 and 2013. Outcomes were compared with those of a cohort of CLI patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass thought to be at high risk for graft failure (tissue loss, a tibial target, and a previous endovascular treatment or bypass). BMCT patients underwent harvest of bone marrow that was then concentrated and injected intramuscularly into the ischemic limb.\nThere were 20 BMCT patients and 35 high-risk bypass patients. All BMCT patients had either rest pain (80%) or tissue loss (80%). The majority (65%) had a prior intervention (bypass, 30%; endovascular, 58%) compared with high-risk bypass patients, all of whom had previous revascularization attempts (bypass, 43% [P = .35]; endovascular, 77% [P = .14]). Mean follow-up was 773 days after BMCT and 972 days after high-risk bypass. All patients tolerated BMCT without issues or complications. A second BMCT treatment was performed in 21% because of clinical deterioration. Wound healing occurred in 75% at 1.5 years, including patients receiving second injections, all of which resolved. Rest pain improved in 87.5% of patients. Pain completely resolved in 58% at 1.5 years. Ankle-brachial index improvement was 0.23 (\u00b10.25). Three BMCT patients went on to amputation. One-year freedom from major amputation or death was 78% for BMCT vs 69% for high-risk bypass (P = .60).\nBMCT is a potential option in CLI patients who are not candidates for bypass or endovascular intervention. Limb salvage is unexpectedly high in this population with few other options.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is widely used for treatment of traumatic aortic injury (TAI). Stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) may be required in up to 40% of patients. We evaluated the long-term effects of intentional LSA coverage (LSAC) on symptoms and return to normal activity in TAI patients compared with a similarly treated group whose LSA was uncovered (LSAU).\nPatients were identified from a prospective institutional trauma registry between September 2005 and July 2012. TAI was confirmed using computed tomography angiography. The electronic medical records, angiograms, and computed tomography angiograms were reviewed in a retrospective fashion. In-person or telephone interviews were conducted using the SF-12v2 (Quality Metrics, Lincoln, RI) to assess quality of life. An additional questionnaire was used to assess specific LSA symptoms and the ability to return to normal activities. Data were analyzed by Spearman rank correlation and multiple linear and logistic regression analysis with appropriate transformations using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nDuring the study period, 82 patients (57 men; mean age 40.5 \u00b1 20 years, mean Injury Severity Score, 34 \u00b1 10.0) underwent TEVAR for treatment of TAI. Among them, LSAC was used in 32 (39.5%) and LSAU in 50. A group of the LSAU patients (n = 22) served as matched controls in the analysis. We found no statistically significant difference in SF-12v2 physical health scores (\u03c1 = -0.08; P = .62) between LSAC and LSAU patients. LSAC patients had slightly better mental health scores (\u03c1 = 0.62; P = .037) than LSAU patients. LSAC patients did not have an increased likelihood of experiencing pain (\u03c1 = -0.0056; P = .97), numbness (\u03c1 = -0.12; P = .45), paresthesia (\u03c1 = -0.11; P = .48), fatigue (\u03c1 = -0.066; P = .69), or cramping (\u03c1 = -0.12; P = .45). We found no difference between groups in the ability to return to activities. The mean follow-up time was 3.35 years. Six LSAC patients (19%) died during the follow-up period of unrelated causes.\nIntentional LSAC during TEVAR for TAI appears safe, without compromising mental or physical health outcomes. Furthermore, LSAC does not increase the long-term risk of upper extremity symptoms or impairment of normal activities.",

    "abstract": "Thrombolysis and open surgical revascularization are current options for the treatment of acute limb ischemia (ALI). Despite the several randomized controlled trials comparing the two options, no single treatment can yet be recommended as a universal initial management of ALI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate contemporary endovascular and surgical revascularization for ALI.\nConsecutive patients with ALI treated with endovascular revascularization (ER) or open revascularization (OR) between 2005 and 2011 were identified and reviewed. Procedural success and outcomes were compared between the two groups. Limb salvage and survival were assessed by time-to-event methods, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and competing-risks regression models.\nA total of 154 limbs were treated in 147 patients in the ER group, compared with 326 limbs in 296 patients in the OR group. The mean follow-up was 14 \u00b1 18.5 months. The majority of patients presented with Rutherford II ischemia (83% for OR, 90% for ER). In Rutherford II patients, technical success was achieved in 90.7% of the OR group vs 79.9% of the ER group (P = .002), with amputation rates of 10.0% vs 7.2% (P = .35) at 30 days and 16.3% vs 13.0% (P = .37) at 1 year, respectively. In Rutherford II patients with failed bypass graft, technical success rate was 95.0% (OR) vs 75.0% (ER) (P = .001), whereas the amputation rate was 6.3% vs 15.38% (P = .13) at 30 days and 24.1% vs 23.1% (P = .90) at 1 year, respectively. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 13.2% (OR) and 5.4% (ER) (P = .012). Overall amputation rates were 13.5% (OR) vs 6.5% (ER) at 30 days (P = .023) and 19.6% (OR) vs 13.0% (ER) at 1 year (P = .074). The primary patency rate was 57% (OR) and 51% (ER) at 1 year (P = .74). Predictors of limb loss by life-table analysis included coronary artery disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; P = .007) and Rutherford category III (HR, 19.0; P < .001). Predictors of death by life-table analysis included age (HR, 1.03; P < .001), end-stage renal disease (HR, 7.28; P < .001), cancer (HR, 1.65; P = .005), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.61; P = .005).\nIn patients presenting with class II ALI, ER or surgical OR resulted in comparable limb salvage rates. Although technical success is higher with OR for patients presenting with failed bypass grafts, the amputation rates are comparable. Overall mortality rates are significantly higher at 30 days and 1 year in the OR group.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to quantify the effect of multidisciplinary care (MDC) on amputation-free survival (AFS) and wound healing within a chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) population.\nWe performed a retrospective, single-center cohort study of consecutive CLI patients presenting to the Vascular Surgery Service. Patients who received initial and follow-up wound care from the MDC were compared with patients who received standard wound care (SWC). The MDC team consisted of vascular, plastic, and podiatric surgeons who jointly managed wound care and directed any other consults or services as deemed necessary. SWC consisted of an inconsistent mix of providers without a defined manager, including nurses, wound care midlevel providers, general surgeons, internists, or the patients themselves. The referring physician determined the allocation of patients. The primary outcome variable was AFS, with a secondary evaluation of wound healing. The effects of baseline demographics, comorbid medical conditions, laboratory values, ischemic lesion severity and location, Rutherford classification, and participation in MDC were assessed. Significant univariate predictors (P < .10) of AFS were entered into a multivariate Cox regression model and assessed at an \u03b1 = .05.\nBetween August 2010 and June 2012, 146 CLI patients (91 male [63%]) were evaluated by the Vascular Surgery Service and were followed up for a median of 539 days (interquartile range 314-679 days). Ischemic tissue loss was present in 85 patients (38 at Rutherford category 5, and 47 at Rutherford category 6). Within this cohort, 51 (60%) had MDC, and 34 (40%) had SWC. Fifty-eight patients (68%) underwent revascularization (open in 17, endovascular in 35, and hybrid in 6), 14 (8%) were managed with primary major amputation, and 13 (15%) declined revascularization. AFS was superior for patients in the MDC arm vs the SWC arm (593.3 \u00b1 53.5 days vs 281.0 \u00b1 38.2 days; log-rank, P = .02). Wound-healing times favored the MDC arm over the SWC arm (444.5 \u00b1 33.2 days vs 625.2 \u00b1 126.5 days), although this was not statistically significant (log-rank, P = .74). Multivariate modelling revealed that independent predictors of major amputation or death, or both, were nonrevascularized patients (hazard ratio [HR], 3.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78-8.02; \u03c7(2), P < .01), treatment by SWC (HR, 2.664; 95% CI, 1.23-5.77; \u03c7(2), P = .012), and baseline nonambulatory status (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.17-2.85; \u03c7(2), P < .01).\nMDC pathways for the management of a population of CLI patients improved AFS by greater than twofold and should be the standard of care for the CLI population. Baseline nonambulatory status and unrevascularized patients also predict worse AFS. Wound healing remains prolonged regardless of preoperative or postoperative wound care. Future study is required to evaluate the costs and functional outcomes for MDC in the management of CLI.",

    "abstract": "The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Inpatient Quality Indicator (IQI) #11, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair mortality rate, is a measure of hospital quality that is publically reported but has not been externally validated. Because the IQI #11 overall mortality rate includes both intact and ruptured aneurysms and open and endovascular repair, we hypothesized that IQI #11 overall mortality rate does not provide accurate assessment of mortality risk after AAA repair and that AAA mortality cannot be accurately assessed by a single quality measure.\nUsing AHRQ IQI software version 4.2, we calculated observed (O) and expected (E) mortality rates for IQI #11 for all hospitals performing more than 10 AAA repairs per year in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the years 2007 to 2011. We used Spearman correlation coefficient to compare expected rates as determined by IQI #11 overall mortality rate risk adjustment methodology and observed rates for all AAA repairs in four cohorts stratified by aneurysm stability (ruptured vs intact) and method of repair (open vs endovascular).\nAmong 187,773 AAA repairs performed at 1268 U.S. hospitals, hospitals' IQI #11 overall expected rates correlated poorly with their observed rates (E: 5.0% \u00b1 4.4% vs O: 6.0% \u00b1 9.8%; r = .49). For ruptured AAAs, IQI #11 overall mortality rate methodology underestimated the mortality risk of open repair (E: 34% \u00b1 7.2% vs O: 40.1% \u00b1 38.2%; r = 0.20) and endovascular repair (E: 24.8% \u00b1 9% vs O: 27.3% \u00b1 37.9%; r = 0.08). For intact AAA repair, IQI #11 overall mortality rate methodology underestimated the mortality risk of open repair (E: 4.3% \u00b1 2.4% vs O: 6.3% \u00b1 16.1%; r = .24) but overestimated the mortality risk of endovascular repair (E: 1.3% \u00b1 0.8% vs O: 1.1% \u00b1 3.7%; r = 0.25). Hospitals' observed mortality rates after intact AAA repair were not correlated with their mortality rates after ruptured AAA repair (r = 0.03).\nIQI #11 overall mortality rate fails to provide accurate assessment of inpatient mortality risk after AAA repair. Thus, it is inappropriate to use IQI #11 overall mortality rate for quality reporting. The accuracy of separate quality measures that assess mortality risk after repair of ruptured and intact AAAs, stratified by the use of open or endovascular repair, should be examined.",

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for 30-day postoperative stroke/death or other major complications.\nThe analysis included 3845 patients undergoing CEA (58.1% with asymptomatic and 41.9% with symptomatic carotid disease). The overall 30-day postoperative stroke/death rate was 3.0% (1.9% in asymptomatic patients, 4.6% in symptomatic patients). The variables that maintained an independent association with postoperative stroke/death after adjustment for other known patient-related and procedure-related factors were age \u226580 years, active smoking, contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis of 80% to 99%, emergency procedure status, preoperative stroke, presence of one or more ACS NSQIP-defined high-risk characteristics (including any or all of New York Heart Association class III/IV congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, recent unstable angina, or recent myocardial infarction), and operative time \u2265150 minutes.\nAfter adjustment for a comprehensive array of patient-related and procedure-related variables of particular import to patients with carotid artery stenosis, we have identified several factors that are independently associated with early stroke or death after CEA. These factors are generally related to the comorbid condition of CEA patients and to specific characteristics of their carotid disease, and not to technical features of the CEA procedure. Knowledge of these factors will assist surgeons in selecting appropriate patients for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous arteriovenous hemodialysis accesses (arteriovenous fistulas [AVFs]) are preferred for chronic hemodialysis access. Preoperative vein mapping by duplex ultrasound is recommended before AVF creation, but there are few data correlating vein diameter with postoperative outcomes. Also, vein diameter has not been included in prior predictive models of fistula maturation. This study aims to test whether preoperative vein diameter is associated with failure of AVF maturation and long-term (secondary) patency.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of clinical variables of patients undergoing brachiobasilic or brachiocephalic AVF creation. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models tested whether preoperative minimum vein diameter (MVD) and clinical covariates were associated with failure of AVF maturation and secondary patency.\nThe sample included 158 adults (54 \u00b1 14 years; 45% male; 61% white; 56% diabetes; body mass index, 32 \u00b1 8; MVD, 3.4 \u00b1 1.1 mm; follow-up, 12 \u00b1 9 months [range, <1-40 months]). Increased MVD was associated with decreased risk of AVF failure. More than one third of AVFs with MVD <2.7 mm failed to mature within 6 months. Multivariate models that adjusted for age, diabetes, race, gender, body mass index, and preoperative dialysis status demonstrated that increased MVD was associated with decreased risk of failure of maturation and better long-term patency overall (P = .005 and P = .001, respectively).\nPatients with a larger MVD on preoperative vein mapping are at lower risk for failure of fistula maturation and have increased long-term AVF patency. MVD is the only clinical or demographic factor associated with both AVF maturation and long-term patency. MVD is an important preoperative indicator of fistula success in assessment of potential AVF sites. Future predictive models of fistula maturation and patency should include MVD.",

    "abstract": "The external carotid artery (ECA) can be an important source of cerebral blood flow in cases of high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. However, the treatment of the ECA is fundamentally different between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). CEA is routinely associated with endarterectomy of the ECA, whereas CAS excludes the ECA from direct flow. We hypothesize that these differences make ECA occlusion more common after CAS. Further, the impact of CAS on blood flow into the ECA is interesting because the flow from the stent into the ECA is altered in a way that may promote local inflammation and may influence in-stent restenosis (ISR). Thus, our objective was to use our institutional database to identify whether CAS increased the rate of ECA occlusion and, if it did, whether ECA occlusion was associated with ISR.\nPatients undergoing CAS or CEA from February 2007 to February 2012 were identified from our institutional carotid therapy database. Preoperative and postoperative images of patients who followed up in our institution were included in the analysis of ECA occlusion and rates of ISR.\nThere were 210 (67%) CAS patients and 207 (60%) CEA patients included in this analysis. Despite CAS patients being younger (68 vs 70 years), having shorter follow-up (12.5 vs 56.2 months), and being more likely to take clopidogrel (97% vs 35%), they had an increased rate of ECA occlusion (3.8%) compared with CEA patients (0.4%). CAS patients who went on to ECA occlusion had an increased incidence of prior neck irradiation (50% vs 15%; P = .03), but we did not identify an association of ECA occlusion with ISR >50%.\nWhereas prior publications have identified increased rates of external carotid stenosis, this is the first demonstration of increased ECA occlusion after CAS. However, ECA occlusion is uncommon (\u223c4%) and did not have an association with ISR >50%. Future work modeling ECA flow patterns before and after CAS will be used to further test this interaction.",

Main inclusion criteria included proximal aortic neck length of 15 mm or more with a diameter up to 27 mm; distal iliac landing zones with a length greater than 10 mm and a diameter between 9 and 18 mm; and aortic bifurcation >18 mm in diameter and access vessels large enough to accept the 14F outer diameter of the delivery system. The primary end point was technical success at 1 month; 2-year safety end points included the absence of device- or procedure-related major adverse events, absence of type I or III endoleaks, and maintenance of device integrity through 2 years of follow-up. Study oversight was provided by a Data Safety Monitoring Board with event adjudication by a Clinical Events Committee and imaging analysis by an independent core laboratory.\nOf 60 successfully treated patients, two did not come back for their 1-month evaluation but remained enrolled in the study; 56 were evaluated at 1 year and 52 at 2 years. Of the 58 patients, 56 met the 1-month primary safety and effectiveness end point (97%; 95% confidence interval, 88%-100%). All patients were free from aneurysm enlargement through 2 years. There were no type I or III endoleaks at the 2-year time point. All-cause mortality at 2 years was 11.5%, and no death was device or procedure related. In total, three patients required a postprocedure intervention, two to repair a type I endoleak and one for limb occlusion. Core laboratory evaluation of the postoperative imaging studies documented absence of endograft migration and stent fractures in all patients.\nThe INCRAFT AAA Stent Graft System provides a durable solution for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, with a low frequency of device-related events through 2 years of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Our institutional quality-improvement (QI) initiative instituted a well-defined office follow-up schedule after arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation, including an office visit within 30 days, fistulogram within 40 days, if indicated, and a second office visit within 55 days. In addition, a patient liaison contacted patients and dialysis units to improve follow-up. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the QI initiative on patient compliance and overall time to AVF permission to cannulate.\nWe performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing first-time radiocephalic, brachiocephalic, and basilic vein transposition creation before the QI initiative (pre-QI group: January to April 2012) and during the QI period (QI group: January to April 2013). Categoric data were compared using \u03c7(2) analysis, and nominal data were compared using the Student t-test.\nWe reviewed 198 first-time AVF creations in patients (57% male) with a mean age of 61 years. Demographics and comorbidities between the pre-QI and QI groups were similar. Compliance with the first 30-day postoperative appointment increased significantly after the QI initiative, from 48% in the pre-QI group to 65% in the QI group (P = .015). Yet, the QI initiative did not maintain an effect on the subsequent follow-up checkpoints. No statistical difference was identified for compliance with fistulogram within 40 days of access creation (pre-QI, 12% vs QI, 25%; P = .093) or for compliance with the 55-day postoperative appointment (pre-QI, 33% vs QI, 23%; P = .457). Both checkpoints demonstrated a very high noncompliance rate. Accordingly, the mean time to permission to cannulate was 88 days for both the pre-QI and QI groups, with a failure to mature rate of 22% for the pre-QI group and 21% for the QI group (P = .816).\nThe QI initiative significantly increased the number of patients complying with the first 30-day follow-up appointment after AVF access creation. However, patient compliance with a timely fistulogram and the second follow-up appointment was poor and not influenced by the QI initiative, limiting the functional effect of the QI initiative on the time to AVF permission to cannulate.",

Two patients without aneurysm had bypasses from the proximal descending thoracic aorta to the infrarenal aorta without aortic resection. There was no in-hospital mortality, stroke, or paraplegia. Long-term survival was 89% during a median follow-up of 81 months (interquartile range, 47-118 months), with no patient requiring reoperation on the repaired segment.\nOpen repair of native and recurrent adult aortic coarctation has acceptable morbidity and low mortality.

    "abstract": "Although statin therapy has been linked to fewer short-term complications after infrainguinal bypass, its effect on long-term survival remains unclear. We therefore examined associations between statin use and long-term mortality, graft occlusion, and amputation after infrainguinal bypass.\nWe used the Vascular Study Group of New England registry to study 2067 patients (71% male; mean age, 67 \u00b1 11 years; 67% with critical limb ischemia [CLI]) who underwent infrainguinal bypass from 2003 to 2011. Of these, 1537 (74%) were on statins perioperatively and at 1-year follow-up, and 530 received no statin. We examined crude, adjusted, and propensity-matched rates of 5-year surviva1, 1-year amputation, graft occlusion, and perioperative myocardial infarction.\nPatients taking statins at the time of surgery and at the 1-year follow-up were more likely to have coronary disease (38% vs 22%; P < .001), diabetes (51% vs 36%; P < .001), hypertension (89% vs 77%; P < .001), and prior revascularization procedures (50% vs 38%; P < .001). Despite higher comorbidity burdens, long-term survival was better for patients taking statins in crude (risk ratio [RR], 0.7; P < .001), adjusted (hazard ratio, 0.7; P = .001), and propensity-matched analyses (hazard ratio, 0.7; P = .03). In subgroup analysis, a survival advantage was evident in patients on statins with CLI (5-year survival rate, 63% vs 54%; log-rank, P = .01) but not claudication (5-year survival rate, 84% vs 80%; log-rank, P = .59). Statin therapy was not associated with 1-year rates of major amputation (12% vs 11%; P = .84) or graft occlusion (20% vs 18%; P = .58) in CLI patients. Perioperative myocardial infarction occurred more frequently in patients on a statin in crude analysis (RR, 2.2; P = .01) but not in the matched cohort (RR, 1.9; P = .17).\nStatin therapy is associated with a 5-year survival benefit after infrainguinal bypass in patients with CLI. However, 1-year limb-related outcomes were not influenced by statin use in our large observational cohort of patients undergoing revascularization in New England.",

    "abstract": "Accurate adjustment of surgical outcome data for risk is vital in an era of surgeon-level reporting. Current risk prediction models for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair are suboptimal. We aimed to develop a reliable risk model for in-hospital mortality after intervention for AAA, using rigorous contemporary statistical techniques to handle missing data.\nUsing data collected during a 15-month period in the United Kingdom National Vascular Database, we applied multiple imputation methodology together with stepwise model selection to generate preoperative and perioperative models of in-hospital mortality after AAA repair, using two thirds of the available data. Model performance was then assessed on the remaining third of the data by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared with existing risk prediction models. Model calibration was assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis.\nA total of 8088 AAA repair operations were recorded in the National Vascular Database during the study period, of which 5870 (72.6%) were elective procedures. Both preoperative and perioperative models showed excellent discrimination, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of .89 and .92, respectively. This was significantly better than any of the existing models (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for best comparator model, .84 and .88; P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). Discrimination remained excellent when only elective procedures were considered. There was no evidence of miscalibration by Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis.\nWe have developed accurate models to assess risk of in-hospital mortality after AAA repair. These models were carefully developed with rigorous statistical methodology and significantly outperform existing methods for both elective cases and overall AAA mortality. These models will be invaluable for both preoperative patient counseling and accurate risk adjustment of published outcome data.",

    "abstract": "Aortic occlusion is accompanied by a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response secondary to increased systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output. This study was designed primarily to determine the safety and cardiovascular response to hydrogen sulfide (H2S; HS) administration with supraceliac aortic cross-clamp and, secondarily, on short-duration resuscitation.\nA validated porcine model (five sham swine compared with five controls) demonstrated a significant hyperdynamic cardiovascular response to 35% blood volume hemorrhage, 50-minute suprarenal aortic cross-clamping, and 6-hour resuscitation. Eight additional experimental swine were administered HS at 4 mg/min during aortic cross-clamping.\nDuring the cross-clamp period, hemodynamic curves of mean arterial pressure and heart rate demonstrated a blunting effect with HS administration, with a significant decrease being seen with mean arterial pressure at the end of the cross-clamp period (120 vs 149 mm Hg; P = .04). Resuscitation requirements were significantly reduced at 6 hours because the HS cohort received 8 L less crystalloid (P = .001) and 10.4 mg less epinephrine (P < .001). There was not a significant change in cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, or pathologic liver analysis.\nThe administration of HS during the 50 minutes of supraceliac aortic cross-clamp significantly reduced stress of the left heart. On clamp release, HS significantly reduced the need for volume and pressors. HS has positive benefits during cross-clamp and subsequent resuscitation, demonstrating that targeted pharmacologic therapy is possible to minimize adverse physiologic changes with aortic occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that peak wall stress (PWS) derived from finite element analysis (FEA) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) predicts clinical outcomes better than diameter alone. Prior models assume uniform wall thickness (UWT). We hypothesize that the inclusion of locally variable wall thickness (VWT) into FEA of AAAs will improve its ability to predict clinical outcomes.\nPatients with AAAs (n = 26) undergoing radiologic surveillance were identified. Custom MATLAB algorithms generated UWT and VWT aortic geometries from computed tomography angiography images, which were subsequently loaded with systolic blood pressure using FEA. PWS and aneurysm expansion (as a proxy for rupture risk and the need for repair) were examined.\nThe average radiologic follow-up time was 22.0 \u00b1 13.6 months and the average aneurysm expansion rate was 2.8 \u00b1 1.7 mm/y. PWS in VWT models significantly differed from PWS in UWT models (238 \u00b1 68 vs 212 \u00b1 73 kPa; P = .025). In our sample, initial aortic diameter was not found to be correlated with aneurysm expansion (r = 0.26; P = .19). A stronger correlation was found between aneurysm expansion and PWS derived from VWT models compared with PWS from UWT models (r = 0.86 vs r = 0.58; P = .032 by Fisher r to Z transformation).\nThe inclusion of locally VWT significantly improved the correlation between PWS and aneurysm expansion. Aortic wall thickness should be incorporated into future FEA models to accurately predict clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "After the creation of an autogenous lower extremity bypass graft, the vein must undergo a series of dynamic structural changes to stabilize the arterial hemodynamic forces. These changes, which are commonly referred to as remodeling, include an inflammatory response, the development of a neointima, matrix turnover, and cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The sum total of these processes results in dramatic alterations in the physical and biomechanical attributes of the arterialized vein. The most clinically obvious and easily measured of these is lumen remodeling of the graft. However, although somewhat less precise, wall thickness, matrix composition, and endothelial changes can be measured in vivo within the healing vein graft. Recent translational work has demonstrated the clinical relevance of remodeling as it relates to vein graft patency and the systemic factors influencing it. By correlating histologic and molecular changes in the vein, insights into potential therapeutic strategies to prevent bypass failure and areas for future investigation are explored.",

    "abstract": "Endograft mural thrombus has been associated with stent graft or limb thrombosis after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). This study aimed to identify clinical and morphologic determinants of endograft mural thrombus accumulation and its influence on thromboembolic events after EVAR.\nA prospectively maintained database of patients treated by EVAR at a tertiary institution from 2000 to 2012 was analyzed. Patients treated for degenerative infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms and with available imaging for thrombus analysis were considered. All measurements were performed on three-dimensional center-lumen line computed tomography angiography (CTA) reconstructions. Patients with thrombus accumulation within the endograft's main body with a thickness >2 mm and an extension >25% of the main body's circumference were included in the study group and compared with a control group that included all remaining patients. Clinical and morphologic variables were assessed for association with significant thrombus accumulation within the endograft's main body by multivariate regression analysis. Estimates for freedom from thromboembolic events were obtained by Kaplan-Meier plots.\nSixty-eight patients (16.4%) presented with endograft mural thrombus. Median follow-up time was 3.54 years (interquartile range, 1.99-5.47 years). In-graft mural thrombus was identified on 30-day CTA in 22 patients (32.4% of the study group), on 6-month CTA in 8 patients (11.8%), and on 1-year CTA in 17 patients (25%). Intraprosthetic thrombus progressively accumulated during the study period in 40 patients of the study group (55.8%). Overall, 17 patients (4.1%) presented with endograft or limb occlusions, 3 (4.4%) in the thrombus group and 14 (4.1%) in the control group (P = .89). Thirty-one patients (7.5%) received an aortouni-iliac (AUI) endograft. Two endograft occlusions were identified among AUI devices (6.5%; overall, 0.5%). None of these patients showed thrombotic deposits in the main body, nor were any outflow abnormalities identified on the immediately preceding CTA. Estimated freedom from thromboembolic events at 5 years was 95% in both groups (P = .97). Endograft thrombus accumulation was associated with >25% proximal aneurysm neck thrombus coverage at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.3), neck length \u2264 15 mm (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2), proximal neck diameter \u2265 30 mm (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.6), AUI (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-5.5), or polyester-covered stent grafts (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.2-7.3) and with main component \"barrel-like\" configuration (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.7-28.3).\nMural thrombus formation within the main body of the endograft is related to different endograft configurations, main body geometry, and device fabric but appears to have no association with the occurrence of thromboembolic events over time.",

    "abstract": "The effect of stent graft fixation type on renal function after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether suprarenal (SR) or infrarenal (IR) fixation influences the risk of renal complications after EVAR.\nWe searched MEDLINE and EMBASE with no date or language restrictions for comparative studies evaluating EVAR with SR vs IR fixation on renal dysfunction, renal artery stenosis, renal artery occlusion, renal infarction, and new need for hemodialysis. For each outcome, we calculated the absolute risk difference (RD) with a random effects meta-analysis and performed assessments of heterogeneity and publication bias. Post hoc subgroup analyses explored the influence of individual moderator variables.\nA total of 21 nonrandomized studies comparing SR vs IR fixation representing 4474 unique patients (SR, 1949; IR, 2525) were included. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between the SR and IR groups. Median patient follow-up was 12 months in each group. There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of any renal complication between SR and IR fixation groups. The absolute RD between the SR and IR fixation groups was <1%, with no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias for renal dysfunction, renal artery stenosis, renal artery occlusion or new need for hemodialysis after EVAR. Renal infarction occurred in 6.4% of SR patients and in 2.5% of IR patients (P = .09), with evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 85%) and publication bias (Egger P = .08). Subgroup analyses revealed that older studies (median treatment period before 2000) reported greater risks of renal infarction with SR fixation (RD, 6.2%; P = .01). However, more contemporary studies (median treatment period after 2000) demonstrated no difference between SR and IR fixation on renal infarction risk (RD, 0.2%; P = .75).\nThere is no difference in the risk of postoperative renal complications when comparing stent grafts using SR vs IR fixation, particularly with newer-generation devices. Contemporary comparative studies with longer-term follow-up are warranted to further elucidate the influence of SR and IR fixation on renal complications.",

    "abstract": "There is abundant evidence linking hostile proximal aortic neck anatomy to poor outcome after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), yet the definition of hostile anatomy varies from study to study. This current analysis was undertaken to identify anatomic criteria that are most predictive of success or failure at the aortic neck after EVAR.\nThe study group comprised 221 patients in the Aneurysm Treatment using the Heli-FX Aortic Securement System Global Registry (ANCHOR) clinical trial, a population enriched with patients with challenging aortic neck anatomy and failure of sealing. Imaging protocols were not protocol specified but were performed according to the institution's standard of care. Core laboratory analysis assessed the three-dimensional centerline-reformatted computed tomography scans. Failure at the aortic neck was defined by type Ia endoleak occurring at the time of the initial endograft implantation or during follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the value of each anatomic measure in the classification of aortic neck success and failure and to identify optimal thresholds of discrimination. Binary logistic regression was performed after excluding highly intercorrelated variables, creating a final model with significant predictors of outcome after EVAR.\nAmong the 221 patients, 121 (54.8%) remained free of type Ia endoleak and 100 (45.2%) did not. Type Ia endoleaks presented immediately after endograft deployment in 58 (58.0%) or during follow-up in 42 (42.0%). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 12 variables where the classification of patients with type Ia endoleak was significantly more accurate than chance alone. Increased aortic neck diameter at the lowest renal artery (P = .013) and at 5 mm (P = .008), 10 mm (P = .008), and 15 mm (P = .010) distally; aneurysm sac diameter (P = .001), common iliac artery diameters (right, P = .012; left, P = .032), and a conical (P = .049) neck configuration were predictive of endoleak. By contrast, increased aortic neck length (P = .050), a funnel-shaped aortic neck (P = .036), and neck mural thrombus content, as measured by average thickness (P = .044) or degrees of circumferential coverage (P = .029), were protective against endoleak. Binary logistic regression identified three variables independently predictive of type Ia endoleak. Neck diameter at the lowest renal artery (P = .002, cutpoint 26 mm) and neck length (P = .017, cutpoint 17 mm) were associated with endoleak, whereas some mural neck thrombus content was protective (P = .001, cutpoint 11\u00b0 of circumferential coverage).\nA limited number of independent anatomic variables are predictive of type Ia endoleak after EVAR, including aortic neck diameter and aortic neck length, whereas mural thrombus in the neck is protective. This study suggests that anatomic measures with identifiable threshold cutpoints should be considered when defining the hostile aortic neck and assessing the risk of complications after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) variant genotypes in patients with significant carotid restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and who underwent a revision CEA.\nThis was a cross-sectional analysis of 97 patients enrolled between 2001 and 2013. Three groups were investigated: group A included patients with internal carotid artery restenosis, group B included patients without restenosis after CEA, and group C included patients with peripheral arterial disease but without any signs of a carotid stenosis. Venous blood samples were drawn for the genotyping for MBL2 by polymerase chain reaction and for the determination of the MBL serum concentration by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay.\nThe serum concentration of MBL was higher in patients with the normal genotype than in those with the genotype variants of MBL (95% confidence interval, 272.8-1008.7 \u03bcg/L; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference among groups A, B, or C with respect to the presence of a variant genotype. Similarly, there was no significant gender difference regarding the presence of a variant genotype (P = .325).\nThe presence of a variant genotype of the MBL2 gene (and the correspondingly lower serum concentration of this molecule) was not correlated with the development of carotid restenosis after CEA beyond a follow-up of 12 months.",

    "abstract": "Registries have been proven useful to assess clinical outcomes, but data entry and personnel expenses are challenging. We developed a registry to track patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) in an integrated health care system, leveraging an electronic medical record (EMR) to evaluate clinical practices, device performance, surgical complications, and medium-term outcomes. This study describes the registry design, data collection, outcomes validation, and ongoing surveillance, highlighting the unique integration with the EMR.\nEVARs in six geographic regions of Kaiser Permanente were entered in the registry. Cases were imported using a screening algorithm of inpatient codes applied to the EMR. Standard note templates containing data fields were used for surgeons to enter preoperative, postoperative, and operative data as part of normal workflows in the operating room and clinics. Clinical content experts reviewed cases and entered any missing data of operative details. Patient comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, implant details, and surgical outcomes were captured. Patients entered in the registry are followed up for life, and all relevant events are captured.\nBetween January 2010 and June 2013, 2112 procedures were entered in the registry. Surgeon compliance with data entry ranges from 60% to 90% by region but has steadily increased over time. Mean aneurysm size was 5.9 cm (standard deviation, 1.3). Most patients were male (84%), were hypertensive (69%), or had a smoking history (79%). The overall reintervention rate was 10.8%: conversion to open repair (0.9%), EVAR revision (2.6%), other surgical intervention (7.3%). Of the reinterventions, 27% were for endoleaks (I, 34.3%; II, 56.9%; III, 8.8%; IV and V, 0.0%), 10.5% were due to graft malfunction, 3.4% were due to infection, and 2.3% were due to rupture.\nLeveraging an EMR provides a robust platform for monitoring short-term and midterm outcomes after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Use of standardized templates in the EMR allows data entry as part of normal workflow, improving compliance, accuracy, and data capture using limited but expert personnel. Assessment of patient demographics, device performance, practice variation, and postoperative outcomes benefits clinical decision-making by providing complete and adjudicated event reporting. The findings from this large, community-based EVAR registry augment other studies limited to perioperative and short-term outcomes or small patient cohorts.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the correlation between an upper limb vascular calcification (Vc) score (VcS) and late all-cause mortality in diabetic hemodialysis patients with distal upper limb arteries medial wall sclerosis (M\u00f6nckeberg disease).\nWe retrospectively reviewed Vc in bilateral upper limb plain radiographs and in duplex ultrasound images performed before radial-cephalic fistula (RCF) creation in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Only medial linear calcifications outlining the vessel wall were considered positive on X-ray images, whereas for ultrasound reviews, only continuous highly echogenic plaques producing bright white echos with shadowing were considered to be medial calcification. A VcS was then applied in each patient. Every half of each of the three main arterial conduits (brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries) in each arm was counted as 1 if it contained \u2265 6 cm of linear calcification, whereas absence of calcification or minimum calcification (length <6 cm) was counted as 0. Long-term all-cause mortality was compared between patients with a low or moderate VcS <8 (group I), patients with a high VcS \u2265 8 (group II), and patients with VcS = 0 (control group). Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for comparisons among the groups.\nNineteen patients had a VcS <8, 21 had VcS \u2265 8, and 43 patients had VcS = 0. The study patients had a mean age of 68 \u00b1 10 years (range, 42-83 years; P = .23). Before early conversion to a RCF, dialysis therapy in 59 (71.1%) had already been initiated through central venous catheters (CVCs). The mean follow-up for groups I, II, and controls was 41.4 \u00b1 41.2 months (range, 4-144 months), 34.15 \u00b1 31.3 months (range, 1-108 months), and 66.7 \u00b1 32.5 months (range, 12-126 months), respectively (P = .0009). Forty-seven patients died during the follow-up period (12 in group II and 24 in the controls; P = .88). Survival rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 78.3%, 65.7%, 54.8%, and 48.1% for group I; 75.2%, 58.8%, 49.3%, and 42% for group II; and 97.7%, 93.1%, 76.8%, and 71.8% for the control group, respectively (P = .013 for all groups; P = .044 for group II vs controls). Patients with (subgroups) or without CVCs at baseline had similar late mortality rates. Patients with CVCs/Vc had lower survival rates than those with CVCs/no Vc at 1 year (73.3% vs 96.5%) and at 3 years (47.7% vs 75.8%; P = .038). CVCs were related to increased risk of death only in subgroup II patients compared with the subcontrol group patients (75.4% vs 37.9% at 5 years, respectively; P = .034).\nDiabetic hemodialysis patients exposed to high levels of upper extremity arterial medial VcSs upon receiving RCFs have an increased long-term mortality risk compared with diabetic hemodialysis patients with no Vc and receiving the same access.

    "abstract": "We evaluated carotid artery outward remodeling and plaque relative signal intensity (rSI) using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI) to investigate their clinical significance in carotid revascularization.\nFrom 86 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS), 88 lesions (51 lesions treated with CEA and 37 lesions treated with CAS) were analyzed retrospectively. We evaluated the preoperative carotid artery remodeling index (CRI), determined by a ratio of the external cross-sectional vessel area at maximum stenosis and the reference cross-sectional vessel area at the distal portion of the internal carotid artery, and the plaque rSI, which is quantified as the ratio between the signal intensities of plaque and adjacent muscle using T1-MRI. We divided carotid lesions into four groups using the median values of CRI and rSI: L/L (CRI < 1.8, rSI < 2.5), H/L (CRI \u2265 1.8, rSI < 2.5), L/H (CRI < 1.8, rSI \u2265 2.5), and H/H (CRI \u2265 1.8, rSI \u2265 2.5). The primary end point was detection of acute ipsilateral ischemia on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 72 hours of treatment.\nMean CRI and rSI were significantly higher in lesions treated with CEA than in those treated with CAS. Postoperative DWI abnormalities were observed in 4 CEA cases (7.8%) and 10 CAS cases (27.0%) (P = .01). In the CAS group, the frequency of DWI abnormalities was 5.5% for the L/L, 40.0% for the H/L and L/H, and 55.5% for the H/H group (P = .009). Multivariate analysis showed that the degree of stenosis and H/H lesion were independent risk factors for cerebral embolism. No correlation was found between plaque parameters and postoperative DWI findings in the CEA group.\nCRI and rSI provide complementary information for the prediction of high-risk plaques associated with CAS but not with CEA. Preoperative evaluation with T1-MRI facilitates the selection of a treatment strategy for carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a pathologic dilation of the aorta. Inflammation of the aortic wall has been shown to be involved in AAA formation. Malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA) adducts are MAA/protein hybrids with immunogenic, proinflammatory, and profibrotic properties. Levels of MAA adducts are elevated in patients with coronary artery disease; however, the role of MAA adducts in AAA is unclear. We hypothesize that levels of circulating antibodies against MAA adducts are increased in patients with AAA.\nPlasma samples were collected from mice and patients with AAA and control patients with atherosclerosis but not AAA. AAA was induced in mice by a standard CaCl2 protocol, with matching sham mice. Plasma levels of anti-MAA antibodies were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nPatients with AAA exhibited higher levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A anti-MAA antibody subtypes (P = .049 and .026, respectively) compared with control patients. Conversely, immunoglobulin M anti-MAA antibodies in AAA patients were lower compared with control patients (P = .018). In CaCl2-treated mice, immunoglobulin G anti-MAA antibodies were elevated after AAA formation (P = .006).\nThe pattern of anti-MAA antibodies is able to distinguish between patients with AAA and patients with atherosclerosis but no AAA. These results demonstrate that MAA adducts are associated with AAA and suggest that they may play a role in either initiating or propagating chronic inflammation in AAA.",

PAD can be detected through a noninvasive measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI).\nWe conducted a systematic review of several electronic bibliographic databases for studies that evaluated ABI as a screening test for PAD in asymptomatic individuals. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis, reporting pooled hazard ratios (HRs) when appropriate.\nWe included 40 individual studies, 2 systematic reviews, and 1 individual-patient data meta-analysis. We found no studies comparing ABI screening with no screening in terms of patient-important outcomes (mortality, amputations). The yield of PAD screening averaged 17% (range, 1%-42%) and was 1% to 4% in lower risk populations. Patients with PAD had higher adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.16-4.12) and of cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-2.89). Data on benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening were limited; however, ABI screening was associated with additional prognostic information and risk stratification for heart disease. The overall quality of evidence supporting screening was low.\nThe current available evidence demonstrates that PAD is common in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but it does not support the benefit of routine ABI screening.",

Arterial thrombi are platelet-rich when examined histologically compared with red blood cells in venous thrombi. Prior studies of platelet biology were not capable of accounting for the rapid kinetics and bond strengths necessary to produce occlusive thrombus under these conditions where the stasis condition of the Virchow triad is so noticeably absent. Recent experiments elucidate the unique pathway and kinetics of platelet aggregation that produce arterial occlusion. Large thrombi form from local release and conformational changes in von Willebrand factor under very high shear rates. The effect of high shear hemodynamics on thrombus growth has profound implications for the understanding of all acute thrombotic cardiovascular events as well as for vascular reconstructive techniques and vascular device design, testing, and clinical performance.",

    "abstract": "Although the endovascular aneurysm repair trial 2 (EVAR-2) demonstrated no benefit of EVAR in high-risk (HR) patients, EVAR is still performed widely in this patient cohort. This study compares the midterm outcomes after EVAR in HR patients with those in normal-risk (NR) patients. In turn, these data are compared with the EVAR-2 data.\nA retrospective review from January 2006 to December 2013 identified 247 patients (75 HR [30.4%], 172 NR [69.6%]) who underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal aortic aneurysm in an academic tertiary institution and its affiliated Veterans Administration hospital. The same HR criteria used in the EVAR-2 trial were employed. Overall survival, graft-related complications, and reintervention rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. HR group outcomes were compared with the EVAR-2 data.\nHR patients had a larger abdominal aortic aneurysm size and had a higher prevalence of cardiac disease (P < .01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .02), renal insufficiency (P < .01), and cancer (P < .01). Use of aspirin (63% HR vs 66% NR; P = .6), statin (83% HR vs 72% NR; P = .2), and beta-blockers (71% HR vs 60% NR; P = .2) was similar; in the EVAR-2 trial, the corresponding use of these medications was 58%, 42%, and not available, respectively. Perioperative mortality (0% HR vs 1.2% NR; P = 1.0) and early complication rates (4% HR vs 6% NR; P = .8) were similar. In contrast, perioperative mortality in the EVAR-2 trial was 9%. At a mean follow-up of 3 years, the incidence rates of delayed secondary interventions for aneurysm- or graft-related complications were 7% for HR patients and 10% for NR patients (P = .5). The 1-, 2-, and 4-year survival rates in HR patients (85%, 77%, 65%) were lower than those in NR patients (97%, 97%, 93%; P < .001), but this was more favorable compared with a 36% 4-year survival in the EVAR-2 trial. No difference was seen in long-term reintervention-free survival in HR and NR patients (P = .8). Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis identified five prognostic indicators for post-EVAR death: age, chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5, congestive heart failure, home oxygen use, and current cancer therapy.\nEVAR can be performed in patients unfit for open surgical repair with excellent early survival and long-term durability. These outcomes in the HR group compare more favorably to the EVAR-2 trial data. However, not all HR patients for open surgical repair derive the benefit from EVAR. The decision to proceed with EVAR in HR patients should be individualized, depending on the number and severity of risk factors.",

Use of aspirin (63% HR vs 66% NR; P = .6), statin (83% HR vs 72% NR; P = .2), and beta-blockers (71% HR vs 60% NR; P = .2) was similar; in the EVAR-2 trial, the corresponding use of these medications was 58%, 42%, and not available, respectively. Perioperative mortality (0% HR vs 1.2% NR; P = 1.0) and early complication rates (4% HR vs 6% NR; P = .8) were similar. In contrast, perioperative mortality in the EVAR-2 trial was 9%. At a mean follow-up of 3 years, the incidence rates of delayed secondary interventions for aneurysm- or graft-related complications were 7% for HR patients and 10% for NR patients (P = .5). The 1-, 2-, and 4-year survival rates in HR patients (85%, 77%, 65%) were lower than those in NR patients (97%, 97%, 93%; P < .001), but this was more favorable compared with a 36% 4-year survival in the EVAR-2 trial. No difference was seen in long-term reintervention-free survival in HR and NR patients (P = .8). Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis identified five prognostic indicators for post-EVAR death: age, chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5, congestive heart failure, home oxygen use, and current cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The Zenith pivot branch (p-branch) fenestrated endovascular graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) is a new \"off-the-shelf\" device to treat patients with juxtarenal aortic aneurysms (JRAs). Two options are currently available, which appear to suit >70% of white patients. This study investigates the anatomic applicability of the p-branch fenestrated graft in a cohort of Asian patients with JRA.\nComputed tomography images of 51 consecutive Asian patients with JRA (43 men; mean age, 76.8 years) were analyzed on an Aquarius workstation (TeraRecon, San Mateo, Calif) and matched to two current configurations of the p-branch (options A and B: single superior mesenteric artery [SMA] and two renal fenestrations, and a celiac axis scallop). With use of the SMA as reference, the anatomic positions of both renal arteries and the celiac axis were figured together with their diameters on a template generated on MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Mass), and then they were matched with two graft configurations. The renal artery origins were assessed for three classes of \"closeness of fit\" based on diameter: perfect match, marginal match, and mismatch, respectively, defined as the renal artery origins being located entirely inside, partially inside, and completely outside their corresponding fenestrations. The suitability of the p-branch graft design to the aneurysms was then evaluated.\nA total of 31 JRA patients (60.8%) were regarded as suitable candidates for one or both p-branch stent grafts (20 with option A, 22 with option B, and 11 with both options). In 35 patients (68.6%), both renal arteries could be aligned with the fenestrations. Among them, 16 patients (31.4%) were perfectly matched, whereas 19 patients (37.2%) were only marginally suitable. The major reason for exclusion was the misalignment of the renal fenestrations. In 16 patients with unsuitable renal fenestrations, 8 were attributed to the right renal origins being located too distally compared with their corresponding fenestrations. Another reason for exclusion was the position of the celiac axis scallop in four patients (7.84%), and insufficient aortic length for the graft was encountered in another four. If the right renal fenestration of option B was adjusted to 20 mm caudal to the SMA fenestration (level with the left fenestration), the match of renal fenestration could reach 78.4% (40 of 51).\nThe present design of the p-branch off-the-shelf fenestrated graft is feasible for a good proportion of JRA patients in Asia. Further refinement of design may improve the anatomic match, especially a lower right renal artery origin.",

    "abstract": "Injury to saphenous vein grafts during surgical preparation may contribute to the subsequent development of intimal hyperplasia, the primary cause of graft failure. Surgical skin markers currently used for vascular marking contain gentian violet and isopropanol, which damage tissue and impair physiologic functions. Brilliant blue FCF (FCF) is a nontoxic dye alternative that may also ameliorate preparation-induced injury.\nPorcine saphenous vein (PSV) was used to evaluate the effect of FCF on physiologic responses in a muscle bath. Cytotoxicity of FCF was measured using human umbilical venous smooth muscle cells. Effect of FCF on the development of intimal hyperplasia was evaluated in organ culture using PSV. Intracellular calcium fluxes and contractile responses were measured in response to agonists and inhibitors in rat aorta and human saphenous vein.\nMarking with FCF did not impair smooth muscle contractile responses and restored stretch injury-induced loss in smooth muscle contractility of PSV. Gentian violet has cytotoxic effects on human umbilical venous smooth muscle cells, whereas FCF is nontoxic. FCF inhibited intimal thickening in PSV in organ culture. Contraction induced by 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate and intracellular calcium flux were inhibited by FCF, oxidized adenosine triphosphate, KN-62, and brilliant blue G, suggesting that FCF may inhibit the purinergic receptor P2X7.\nOur studies indicated that FCF is a nontoxic marking dye for vein grafts that ameliorates vein graft injury and prevents intimal thickening, possibly due to P2X7 receptor inhibition. FCF represents a nontoxic alternative for vein graft marking and a potentially therapeutic approach to enhance outcome in autologous transplantation of human saphenous vein into the coronary and peripheral arterial circulation.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery patients have increased medical comorbidities that amplify the complexity of their care. We assessed the effect of a hospitalist comanagement service on inpatient vascular surgery outcomes.\nWe divided 1059 patients into two cohorts for comparison: 515 between January 2012 and December 2012, before the implementation of a hospitalist comanagement service, and 544 between January 2013 and October 2013, after the initiation of a hospitalist comanagement service. Nine vascular surgeons and 10 hospitalists participated in the hospitalist comanagement service. End points measured were in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rates, visual analog scale pain scores (0-10), inpatient adult safety assessments using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators, and resident perceptions assessed by survey.\nThe in-hospital mortality rate decreased from 1.75% to 0.37% after the implementation of the hospitalist comanagement service (P = .016), with a decrease in the observed-to-expected ratio from 0.89 to 0.22. The risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality decreased from 1.56% to 0.0008% (P = .003). Mean LOS was lower in the base period, at 5.1 days vs 5.5 days (P < .001), with an observed-to-expected ratio of 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. The risk-adjusted LOS increased from 4.2 days to 4.3 days (P < .001). The overall 30-day readmission rate was unchanged, at 23.1% compared with 22.8% (P = .6). The related 30-day readmission rate was also similar, at 11.5% compared with 11.4% (P = .5). Patients reporting no pain during hospitalization increased from 72.8% before the hospitalist comanagement service to 77.8% after (P = .04). Reports of moderate pain decreased from 14% to 9.6% (P = .016). Mild and severe pain scores were similar between the two groups. Adult safety measured by AHRQ demonstrated a decrease from three to zero patients in the number of deaths among surgical patients with treatable complications (P = .04). Most house staff reported that the comanagement program had a positive effect on patient care and education.\nThe hospitalist comanagement service has resulted in a significant decrease in in-hospital mortality rates, patient safety, as measured by AHRQ, and improved pain scores. Resident surveys demonstrated perceived improvement in patient care and education. Continued observation will be necessary to assess the long-term effect of the hospitalist comanagement service on quality metrics.",

Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease.\nClinical, angiographic, and procedural data for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease using Viabahn covered stent grafts at a single institution between 2006 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Graft patency and freedom from thrombolysis, major adverse limb event, and reintervention were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The influence of relevant variables on clinical outcome was determined through univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.\nViabahn stent grafts were placed in a total of 91 limbs in 61 patients (66% men; mean age, 69 \u00b1 12 years) during the study period. Indication for intervention was either claudication (n = 59) or critical limb ischemia (n = 32), with the majority (70%) classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C (n = 33) or D (n = 31) lesions. Mean follow-up was 38.3 months (range, 1-91 months). Postprocedural pharmacologic regimens included aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin (47%); indefinite aspirin and clopidogrel (46%); or aspirin and temporary clopidogrel (7%). Primary and secondary patency rates were 60%, 44%, and 36% and 95%, 82%, and 74% at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated more aggressive antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimens to be associated with improved primary patency and freedom from reintervention. Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II D lesions, tobacco use, coronary artery disease, and smaller stent diameter to be independent risk factors for stent graft failure. Bleeding events were limited to those in the aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin group (11.6% [n = 5]; P = .052), although the majority of these events were not life-threatening, and only two cases required blood transfusion.\nIncreasingly aggressive antithrombotic regimens after Viabahn stent graft placement trended toward improved overall clinical outcomes, although the marginal patency benefit observed with the addition of warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy was tempered by an observed increased risk of bleeding complications. Longer term follow-up and multicenter studies are needed to further define optimal type and duration of antithrombotic therapy after endovascular peripheral interventions.",

Demographics, clinical data, and outcomes were extracted. Patients were compared according to DNR status. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality.\nDuring the study period, 16,678 patients underwent emergency vascular operations (10.8% of the total vascular surgery population). Of those, 548 patients (3.3%) had a DNR status. The differences in rates of open or endovascular repair or of intraoperative blood requirement between the two groups were not significant. After adjusting for differences in demographics and clinical data, DNR patients were more likely to have higher rates of graft failure (8.7% vs 2.4%; adjusted P < .01) and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation (14.9 % vs 9.9%; adjusted P < .001). DNR status was associated with a 2.5-fold rise in 30-day mortality (35.0% vs 14.0%; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.9; adjusted P < .001).\nThe presence of a DNR order was independently associated with mortality. Patient and family counseling on surgical expectations before emergency vascular operations is warranted because the risks of perioperative events are significantly elevated when a DNR order exists.",

    "abstract": "We report our experience of endovascular management and postoperative aortic remodeling of all types of isolated abdominal aortic dissection (IAAD).\nThis was retrospective study of 28 IAAD patients treated by endovascular means in our department between January 2007 and July 2013. We reviewed the risk factors, clinical features, computed tomography images, follow-up results, and aortic remodeling of these IAAD patients and propose a new morphologic classification into three types-supraceliac, paravisceral, and infrarenal-according to the location of the primary entry site.\nThere were four supraceliac IAADs, one paravisceral IAAD, and 23 infrarenal IAADs in our case series. Suprarenal (supraceliac + paravisceral) IAAD patients were relatively younger than infrarenal patients (45.2 \u00b1 8.6 years vs 60.6 \u00b1 15.5 years; P < .05). No difference was observed between suprarenal and infrarenal IAADs with respect to true lumen, false lumen, and dissection length on imaging (P > .05). All patients received endovascular treatment. The primary technical success rate was 100%. During a follow-up of 35.7 \u00b1 19.9 months, only one infrarenal patient needed an endovascular reintervention. All patients with supraceliac or infrarenal IAADs were alive at the time of follow-up; however, a paravisceral patient died of a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture 21 months after endovascular treatment. In the suprarenal and infrarenal groups, endovascular treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the false lumen size and increase in the true lumen size (P < .05). The maximum abdominal aorta diameter decreased after endovascular treatment in both groups but was statistically significant only in the infrarenal group (P < .05).\nIAAD is a rare vascular disease. We propose it should be categorized as supraceliac, paravisceral, and infrarenal IAAD according to the location of the primary entry site. Endovascular treatment for supraceliac and infrarenal IAADs is a safe method with a high technical success rate and promising aortic remodeling, whereas endovascular treatment for paravisceral IAADs remains difficult.",

    "abstract": "Common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) for limited arterial occlusive disease is considered a fairly low-risk operation of short duration. This study investigated the timing of 30-day outcomes as they related to hospital discharge and predicted the risk of operative mortality of this procedure.\nAll patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent isolated CFE between 2005 and 2010 were selected for the test sample. We identified postoperative mortality and morbidities occurring before and after hospital discharge. A risk calculator for 30-day mortality, developed in the test sample using logistic regression, was validated in a new sample of cases from 2011 to 2012.\nA total of 1843 CFEs reported from 2005 to 2010 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The average operative time was 146 \u00b1 69.5 minutes (median, 133; interquartile range, 98-179 minutes), and 10% of patients needed to return to the operating room. The average length of stay was 4 \u00b1 7.5 days (median, 3; interquartile range, 2-5 days); 91% of patients were discharged \u2264 1 week of surgery. Occurrences of cardiovascular events, renal dysfunction, and pulmonary complication were relatively low. There was 3.4% mortality and 8% wound-related complications, 30% and 86% of which occurred after hospital discharge, respectively. Overall, there was a 15% risk of combined mortality/morbidity, and >60% of these events occurred after discharge. The independent predictors of 30-day mortality were age, nonindependent functional status, preoperative dialysis, sepsis, emergency status, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification 4 or 5, and the association between risk strata and death in the validation sample was strong (\u03c6 = 0.29) and significant (P < .001).\nCFE is not as \"benign\" a procedure as previously believed. The risks of death and wound complications are not insignificant, and a high percentage of these complications occurred after patients were discharged from the hospital. Patients should be carefully selected, especially in the elderly population, and close postoperative follow-up should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The natural response to arterial occlusive disease is enlargement of collaterals; however, the molecular factors that control collateralization are not well understood. The gene p27(Kip1) (p27) affects human response to arterial injury. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of p27 inhibits vascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and angiogenesis. To test the hypothesis that knockout of p27 would improve collateralization in reaction to ischemia, we performed in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro experiments using p27 knockout (p27(-/-)) and wild-type (wt) mice.\nHindlimb ischemia was induced by left femoral artery ligation in p27(-/-) and wt (C57BL/6) female mice. The mice underwent weekly laser Doppler perfusion imaging of the footpads until sacrifice on postoperative day 28 followed by microcomputed tomography scanning of both hindlimbs. VSMCs were isolated from p27(-/-) and wt mice and used in migration and gel contraction assays in the absence and presence of the nonspecific matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor BB94. MMP-2 and MMP-9 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in p27(-/-) and wt VSMCs.\np27(-/-) mice reperfused more effectively than wt mice by laser Doppler starting from day 7 (ischemic/nonischemic ratio, 0.33\u00a0\u00b1 0.02 vs 0.25\u00a0\u00b1 0.02; P\u00a0< .05) and continuing through day 28 (0.45\u00a0\u00b1 0.04 vs 0.31\u00a0\u00b1 0.04; P\u00a0< .05). The gracilis collateral diameter was similar for the nonischemic hindlimbs of the p27(-/-) and wt mice, and this collateral pathway increased similarly after ischemia as assessed by microcomputed tomography. However, the p27(-/-) mice significantly enlarged a novel collateral pathway that bridged directly between the femoral artery proximal to the ligation site and the saphenous or popliteal artery distal to the ligation site more than wt mice (158\u00a0\u00b1 18.3 vs 82\u00a0\u00b1 22\u00a0\u03bcm; P\u00a0< .001). p27(-/-) VSMCs migrated more (79%\u00a0\u00b1 5% vs 56%\u00a0\u00b1 6%; P\u00a0< .05) and caused more gel contraction (18%\u00a0\u00b1 5% of the initial area vs 43%\u00a0\u00b1 4%; P\u00a0< .05) than wt cells. Migration and collagen contraction were abolished in p27(-/-) and wt cells by MMP inhibition. p27(-/-) cells expressed significantly more MMP-2 mRNA than wt cells did.\nKnockout of p27 enhances arterial collateralization in response to hindlimb ischemia through enlargement of a new collateral pathway. In\u00a0vitro, knockout of p27 increases collagen gel contraction in addition to stimulating VSMC migration. We speculate that p27 may affect collateralization through its role in regulating MMP-2 expression.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are local dilations that can lead to a fatal hemorrhage when ruptured. Wall stress analysis of AAAs is a novel tool that has proven high potential to improve risk stratification. Currently, wall stress analysis of AAAs is based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging; however, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) has great advantages over CT and magnetic resonance imaging in terms of costs, speed, and lack of radiation. In this study, the feasibility of 3D US as input for wall stress analysis is investigated. Second, 3D US-based wall stress analysis was compared with CT-based results.\nThe 3D US and CT data were acquired in 12 patients (diameter, 35-90 mm). US data were segmented manually and compared with automatically acquired CT geometries by calculating the similarity index and Hausdorff distance. Wall stresses were simulated at P = 140 mm Hg and compared between both modalities.\nThe similarity index of US vs CT was 0.75 to 0.91 (n = 12), with a median Hausdorff distance ranging from 4.8 to 13.9 mm, with the higher values found at the proximal and distal sides of the AAA. Wall stresses were in accordance with literature, and a good agreement was found between US- and CT-based median stresses and interquartile stresses, which was confirmed by Bland-Altman and regression analysis (n = 8). Wall stresses based on US were typically higher (+23%), caused by geometric irregularities due to the registration of several 3D volumes and manual segmentation. In future work, an automated US registration and segmentation approach is the essential point of improvement before pursuing large-scale patient studies.\nThis study is a first step toward US-based wall stress analysis, which would be the modality of choice to monitor wall stress development over time because no ionizing radiation and contrast material are involved.",

Wall stresses were in accordance with literature, and a good agreement was found between US- and CT-based median stresses and interquartile stresses, which was confirmed by Bland-Altman and regression analysis (n = 8). Wall stresses based on US were typically higher (+23%), caused by geometric irregularities due to the registration of several 3D volumes and manual segmentation. In future work, an automated US registration and segmentation approach is the essential point of improvement before pursuing large-scale patient studies.",

    "abstract": "Adventitial collagen structure provides the aorta with tensile strength. Like other collagen-rich tissues, it can be affected by internal factors including aging and location. We determined whether the structural characteristics of human aortic adventitial collagen change with aging, location, and aneurysm formation.\nNonatherosclerotic nonaneurysmal (NANA) human abdominal aortas were collected from 15 individuals who had died of noncardiovascular diseases (<40\u00a0years old, NANA young, n\u00a0= 5; >60\u00a0years old, NANA old, n\u00a0= 5). The architecture of adventitial collagen in the aortas was assessed by scanning electron microscopy, and fiber orientation was assessed by polarized microscopy with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform. We then analyzed retardation as an anisotropic property of adventitial collagen by polarized light microscopy. The orientation and retardation of NANA aortas were compared with those of abdominal aortic specimens from patients who were surgically treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (>60\u00a0years old, n\u00a0= 11).\nAdventitial collagen of the abdominal aortas on scanning electron microscopy images appeared as wavy, ropy fibers in aortas from young individuals (NANA young, n\u00a0= 5) and were essentially flattened in those from older patents (NANA old, n\u00a0= 5) and from those with AAA. Collagen fibers were thicker but sparser in the adventitia of aortas with AAA. Orientation maintained in the collagen fibers of NANA aortas (n\u00a0= 15) on two-dimensional fast Fourier transform analysis was unrelated to either location or age and did not differ between NANA aortas and those with AAA. However, collagen fibrils in NANA aortas (n\u00a0= 15) were significantly less retarded only at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery compared with other aortic locations. In addition, retardation was significantly reduced in abdominal aortas with AAA at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery.\nThe basic structure of adventitial collagen fiber was maintained in abdominal aortas regardless of location or age. Because the molecular structure at the subfibril level changed at abdominal aorta and enhanced in aortas with AAA, alterations in the molecular structure of adventitial collagen might be associated with aneurysmal formation.",

    "abstract": "Elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery relies on balancing the risk of the intervention against the risk of the aneurysm causing death. Although much is known about intervention at 5.5 cm, little is known about the fate of the patient unfit for elective surgery at this threshold. Medical therapy and endovascular surgery have revolutionized management of aortic aneurysms in the last 20 years and are thought to have affected rupture rates.\nMEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Database were searched for studies reporting follow-up of untreated large AAA approach from inception to January 2014. Data were pooled using random-effects analysis with standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported. The primary end points were rupture rates and all-cause mortality per year by AAA size.\nThe search strategy identified 1892 citations, of which 11 studies comprising 1514 patients experiencing 347 ruptured AAA were included. The overall incidence of ruptured AAA in patients with AAA >5.5 cm was 5.3% (95% CI, 3.1%-7.5%) per year. This represented cumulative yearly rupture rates of 3.5% (95% CI, -1.6% to 8.7%) in AAAs 5.5 to 6.0 cm, 4.1% (95% CI, -0.7% to 9.0%) in AAAs 6.1 to 7.0 cm, and 6.3% (95% CI, -1.8% to 14.3%) in AAAs >7.0 cm. There was no heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 0%). Only 32% of these patients were offered repair on rupturing an AAA, with a perioperative mortality of 58% (95% CI, 32%-83%). The risk of death from causes other than AAA was higher than the risk of death from rupture.\nRupture rates of untreated AAA were lower than those currently quoted in the literature. Non-AAA-related mortality in this group of patients is high.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the natural history of patients with acute type B aortic dissection who were initially managed with medical therapy alone.\nAll patients with acute type B aortic dissection who were initially managed medically between March 1999 and March 2011 were included. Failure of medical therapy was defined as any death or aorta-related intervention. Early failure occurred within 15 days of presentation. Predictors of long-term outcomes were determined using backward stepwise regression.\nA total of 298 patients with medically managed acute type B dissections were identified. The cohort had an average age of 65.9 years at presentation and was 61.7% male. There were 174 (58.4%) failures including 119 deaths and 87 interventions (24 endovascular, 63 open); 57 (66%) interventions were performed for aneurysmal degeneration. There were 37 (12%) early failures including 14 deaths and 25 interventions (10 endovascular, 15 open). Aneurysmal degeneration was the indication for intervention in six patients (24%). Mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.1-14.7 years). Kaplan-Meier estimate demonstrated that freedom from intervention was 77.3% \u00b1 2.4% at 3 years and 74.2% \u00b1 2.5% at 6 years. There were no predictors of freedom from intervention. Kaplan-Meier estimate demonstrated that the intervention-free survival was 55.0% \u00b1 3.0% at 3 years and 41.0% \u00b1 3.2% at 6 years. End-stage renal disease was predictive of failure of medical treatment (hazard ratio, 2.60; confidence interval, 1.19-5.66; P = .02), and age >70 years was protective against failure (hazard ratio, 0.97; confidence interval, 0.95-0.98; P < .01). Kaplan-Meier estimate demonstrated that survival after 6 years was higher in patients who underwent interventions (76% vs 58%; P = .018).\nThe majority of patients with acute type B dissection will fail medical therapy over time as evidenced by a 6-year intervention-free survival of 41%. Patients who underwent any aortic intervention had a significant survival advantage over those who were treated with medical management alone.

Twenty patients died out of the hospital, and 144 of the 196 patients (73%) admitted to the hospital underwent surgery. The intervention rate varied from 48% to 81% during the study period. The adjusted mortality rate was 7.5 per 100,000 per year (95% CI, 6.3-8.8). No differences in the incidence and mortality rates were found in comparing early and late periods. The 90-day standardized mortality ratio for the study period was 37.2 (95% CI, 31.6-43.7). The overall 90-day mortality was 68% (146 of 216 persons) and 51% (74 of 144 persons) for the patients treated for rAAA.\nWe found a stable incidence and mortality rate during a decade. The prehospital death rate was lower (9%), the intervention rate (73%) higher, and the total mortality (68%) lower than in most other studies. Geographic and regional differences may influence the epidemiologic description of rAAA and hence should be taken into consideration in comparing outcomes for in-hospital mortality and intervention rates.",

    "abstract": "Color duplex sonography (CDS) today is broadly used in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected cranial or extracranial giant cell arteritis (GCA). This study aimed to determine the prognostic impact of the disease pattern assessed by CDS on the treatment response in GCA.\nThis was a retrospective, longitudinal follow-up study of 43 patients who were diagnosed with GCA at our institution between 2002 and 2010. All patients underwent CDS of the temporal and subclavian/axillary arteries at baseline and were observed for at least 6 months. Vasculitis was sonographically characterized by a circumferential, hypoechogenic wall thickening. According to the CDS findings, patients were categorized into patients with involvement of the subclavian/axillary arteries only (group A1, n = 17), patients with involvement of both the subclavian/axillary arteries and the temporal arteries (group A2, n = 9), and patients with isolated cranial GCA (group B, n = 17). Data on recurrences, corticosteroid doses, and steroid-sparing agents were extracted from the medical records. Treatment response over time was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing.\nThe mean follow-up time was 25.4 months and did not differ between groups (P = .4). Patients in group A1 were significantly younger than patients in groups A2 and B (P < .01). The interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was significantly longer in groups A1 and A2 compared with group B (P < .01). The number of recurrences per month was significantly higher in group A2 compared with group A1 and group B (A1, 0.07; A2, 0.13; B, 0.03; P < .01). Whereas there were no significant differences in the mean time until a daily prednisolone dose <10 mg was reached, patients in group A2 more frequently required steroid-sparing agents (A1, 24%; A2, 56%; B, 24%; P = .04).\nExtensive vascular involvement of both the temporal and subclavian/axillary arteries, as depicted by CDS, may be associated with a poor treatment response in GCA.",

    "abstract": "Prior reports have suggested unfavorable outcomes after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) performed outside of the recommended instructions for use (IFU) guidelines. We report our long-term EVAR experience in a large multicenter registry with regard to adherence to IFU guidelines.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, 489 of 1736 patients who underwent EVAR had preoperative anatomic measurements obtained from the M2S, Inc, imaging database (West Lebanon, NH). We examined outcomes in these patients with regard to whether they had met the device-specific IFU criteria. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and aneurysm-related mortality. Secondary outcomes were endoleak status, adverse events, reintervention, and aneurysm sac size change.\nThe median follow-up for the 489 patients was 3.1 years (interquartile range, 1.6-5.0 years); 58.1% (n = 284) had EVAR performed within IFU guidelines (IFU-adherent group), and 41.9% (n = 205) had EVAR performed outside of IFU guidelines (IFU-nonadherent group). Preoperative anatomic data showed that 62.4% of the IFU-nonadherent group had short neck length, 10.2% had greater angulation than recommended, 7.3% did not meet neck diameter criteria, and 20% had multiple anatomic issues. A small portion (n = 49; 10%) of the 489 patients were lost to follow-up because of leaving membership enrollment (n = 28), moving outside the region (n = 10), or discontinuing image surveillance (n = 11). There was no significant difference in any of the primary or secondary outcomes between the IFU-adherent and IFU-nonadherent groups. Aneurysm sac size change at any time point during follow-up also did not differ significantly between the two groups. A Cox proportional hazard model showed that IFU nonadherence was not predictive of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.0; P = .91). Similarly, IFU nonadherence was not identified as a risk factor for aneurysm-related mortality or adverse events in stepwise Cox proportional hazards models.\nIn our cohort of EVAR patients with detailed preoperative anatomic information and long-term follow-up, overall mortality and aneurysm-related mortality were unaffected by IFU adherence. In addition, rates of endoleak and reintervention after initial EVAR were similar, suggesting that lack of IFU-based anatomic suitability was not a driver of outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Greater flexibility and smaller sizes for introducer sheaths in the newest stent grafts increase the feasibility of endovascular aneurysm repair but raise concerns about long-term limb patency. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of and predictive factors for limb occlusion after use of the Endurant stent graft (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) for abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nThe Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket Registry (ENGAGE) prospectively included 1143 patients treated with bifurcated devices who were observed for up to 2 years. Limb occlusions were evidenced by computed tomography, angiography, or ultrasound. To predict stent graft limb occlusion, a two-step model-building technique was applied. We first identified predictors from a total of 47 covariates obtained at baseline and in the periprocedural period. Subsequently, we reduced the set of potential predictors to key factors that are clinically meaningful. To handle large numbers of covariates, we used the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) method.\nForty-two stent graft limbs occluded in 39 patients (3.4% of the patients). At 2 years, the rate of freedom from stent graft limb occlusion calculated by Kaplan-Meier plot was 97.9% (standard error [SE], 0.33%). Of the 42 occlusions, 13 (31%) were observed within 30 days and 30 (71%) within 6 months. The strongest independent predictors were distal landing zone on the external iliac artery, external iliac artery diameter \u226410 mm, and kinking. High-risk vs low-risk patients were identified according to a decision tree based on the strongest predictors. Freedom from stent graft limb occlusion was 96.1% (SE, 0.64%) in high-risk patients vs 99.6% (SE, 0.19%) in low-risk patients.\nAfter Endurant stent grafting, the incidence of limb occlusion was low. Classifying patients as high risk vs low risk according to the algorithm used in this study may help define specific strategies to prevent limb occlusion and improve the overall results of endovascular aneurysm repair using the latest generation of stent grafts.",

    "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors are widely used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to accomplish glycemic control through an increase in the blood glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentration. These agents also inhibit vascular inflammation (eg, in atherosclerosis). This study was undertaken to determine whether and how vildagliptin (a potent dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor) might reduce intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.\nTwelve rabbits were randomly divided into two groups; one group received vildagliptin orally (10\u00a0mg/kg/d; n\u00a0= 6), whereas the control group (n\u00a0= 6) did not. Vildagliptin administration was started 7\u00a0days before rabbits underwent interposition reversed autologous jugular vein grafting and ended at graft harvesting (28\u00a0days after the operation). Histochemical changes in the vascular wall were examined, as were changes in the acetylcholine-induced effects on the endothelial Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and endothelium-dependent relaxation.\nUnder fasting conditions, vildagliptin increased the plasma GLP-1 concentration, without affecting plasma glucose or insulin. Acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxation only in the vildagliptin group, and this was blocked by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine. Acetylcholine did not modify the endothelial [Ca(2+)]i in either the control or vildagliptin group. Intimal hyperplasia was significantly less in the vildagliptin group (0.11\u00a0\u00b1 0.02\u00a0mm, n\u00a0= 5) than in the controls (0.31\u00a0\u00b1 0.06\u00a0mm, n\u00a0= 4; P\u00a0< .01).\nVildagliptin increased the plasma GLP-1 concentration. It also enhanced acetylcholine-induced [Ca(2+)]i-independent endothelial nitric oxide release and reduced vein graft intimal hyperplasia, independently of any glycemic control action.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the new Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification system correlates with important clinical outcomes for limb salvage and wound healing.\nA total of 201 consecutive patients with threatened limbs treated from 2010 to 2011 in an academic medical center were analyzed. These patients were stratified into clinical stages 1 to 4 on the basis of the SVS WIfI classification. The SVS objective performance goals of major amputation, 1-year amputation-free survival (AFS) rate, and wound healing time (WHT) according to WIfI clinical stages were compared.\nThe mean age was 58 years (79% male, 93% with diabetes). Forty-two patients required major amputation (21%); 159 (78%) had limb salvage. The amputation group had a significantly higher prevalence of advanced stage 4 patients (P < .001), whereas the limb salvage group presented predominantly as stages 1 to 3. Patients in clinical stages 3 and 4 had a significantly higher incidence of amputation (P < .001), decreased AFS (P < .001), and delayed WHT (P < .002) compared with those in stages 1 and 2. Among patients presenting with stage 3, primarily as a result of wound and ischemia grades, revascularization resulted in accelerated WHT (P = .008).\nThese data support the underlying concept of the SVS WIfI, that an appropriate classification system correlates with important clinical outcomes for limb salvage and wound healing. As the clinical stage progresses, the risk of major amputation increases, 1-year AFS declines, and WHT is prolonged. We further demonstrated benefit of revascularization to improve WHT in selected patients, especially those in stage 3. Future efforts are warranted to incorporate the SVS WIfI classification into clinical decision-making algorithms in conjunction with a comorbidity index and anatomic classification.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed outcomes for patients with persistent intraoperative type Ia endoleaks after standard endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe study group was identified from a consecutive cohort of 209 patients undergoing EVAR in a tertiary center in the United Kingdom during a 2-year period. Data prospectively collected on departmental computerized databases were retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcome parameters were defined as freedom from type Ia endoleak, EVAR-related reintervention, aneurysm rupture, and aneurysm-related mortality.\nA completion angiogram identified 44 patients (21%) as having a type Ia endoleak, and 33 (75%) had a persistent endoleak after intraoperative adjunctive procedures, including repeated balloon moulding, aortic cuff extension, and Palmaz stent (Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla) deployment. In the 11 patients (25%) whose endoleak was successfully abolished intraoperatively, there was no recurrence of type Ia endoleak or secondary intervention to treat type 1a endoleak during a median follow-up period of 27 months. Of the 33 patients with persistent endoleak, 31 (94%) demonstrated resolution of the endoleak on first surveillance computed tomography angiography. One patient was lost to follow-up. Embolization of the endoleak in another patient was successful using Onyx (Micro Therapeutics, Inc, Irvine, Calif) 8 days after the initial procedure. No type Ia endoleak was identified after this on any surveillance imaging, and the patient was alive 28 months later with a stable aneurysm size. In the rest of the patients, no recurrence of the endoleak in any subsequent imaging was noticed, and no secondary intervention was required during follow-up. No aneurysm-related deaths occurred, and 91% of the patients had a stable or shrinking aneurysm.\nDespite adjunctive intraoperative maneuvers, persistent type Ia endoleaks can be relatively common. Our study indicates that they may be observed in selected patients. Further research is required to investigate the natural course and management of type Ia endoleaks identified intraoperatively.",

Regions with fewer than 200 LEB procedures were excluded from the regional analysis. The modality of CI was defined as duplex ultrasound, angiography, or both.\nA total of 14,140 LEBs were captured, with the rate of CI being 43%. After exclusion of three regions for insufficient volume (<200 LEBs), 13,945 LEB operations across 13 regions were available for regional analysis. Use of any type of intraoperative CI varied across regions from a low of 8% to a high of 70%, with angiography being performed most frequently. When CI was performed, the type of imaging modality varied between regions from a high of 99% for angiography to a high of 75% for duplex ultrasound. CI was more common in male patients (44% of male patients vs 42% of female patients; P = .032), diabetics (44% of diabetic patients vs 42% of nondiabetic patients; P = .026), and patients with coronary artery disease (45% of patients with coronary artery disease vs 42% of patients with no coronary artery disease; P = .0015). CI was performed less frequently in LEB using single-segment great saphenous vein vs LEB using lesser saphenous, arm, or composite vein (48% vs 57%; P < .0001). CI was used in 51% of LEBs with a tibial or pedal target vessel vs 38% of LEBs with a more proximal target vessel (P < .0001). Patients with an indication of critical limb ischemia underwent CI in 45% of LEBs vs 39% with an indication other than critical limb ischemia (P < .0001).\nWithin the VQI database, considerable practice pattern variation exists in the use of CI. Currently, CI is most commonly employed for patients with critical limb ischemia, infrageniculate target vessel, and disadvantaged venous conduit. Further study is required to standardize and to define the appropriate use of CI for LEBs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to report long-term results of early endovascular aortic aneurysm repair after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nThis was a retrospective analysis of all patients presenting with abdominal aortic aneurysm and coronary artery disease treated during the same hospitalization by endovascular aortic aneurysm repair performed soon after PCI. Primary outcomes were perioperative mortality, perioperative complications, survival after treatment, and freedom from reintervention.\nA total of 20 patients were included, and all completed both procedures. No deaths or abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures occurred between the PCI and the aortic intervention. Perioperative mortality was 5% as one patient died of mesenteric ischemia after endovascular aneurysm repair. Major cardiovascular vascular complications occurred in four patients (20%) and included non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (one) and access vessel complication (three). Mean follow-up was 94 (range, 1-164; standard deviation, 47) months. Estimated survival at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years was 90%, 90%, 90%, and 60%, respectively. A reoperation was required in six patients. Estimated freedom from reintervention at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years was 83%, 83%, 78%, and 72%, respectively.\nOur study indicates that early endovascular aneurysm repair performed within a week after PCI may be a reasonable approach in patients with large or symptomatic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular robotics systems, now approved for clinical use in the United States and Europe, are seeing rapid growth in interest. Determining who has sufficient expertise for safe and effective clinical use remains elusive. Our aim was to analyze performance on a robotic platform to determine what defines an expert user.\nDuring three sessions, 21 subjects with a range of endovascular expertise and endovascular robotic experience (novices <2 hours to moderate-extensive experience with >20 hours) performed four tasks on a training model. All participants completed a 2-hour training session on the robot by a certified instructor. Completion times, global rating scores, and motion metrics were collected to assess performance. Electromagnetic tracking was used to capture and to analyze catheter tip motion. Motion analysis was based on derivations of speed and position including spectral arc length and total number of submovements (inversely proportional to proficiency of motion) and duration of submovements (directly proportional to proficiency).\nNinety-eight percent of competent subjects successfully completed the tasks within the given time, whereas 91% of noncompetent subjects were successful. There was no significant difference in completion times between competent and noncompetent users except for the posterior branch (151 s:105 s; P = .01). The competent users had more efficient motion as evidenced by statistically significant differences in the metrics of motion analysis. Users with >20 hours of experience performed significantly better than those newer to the system, independent of prior endovascular experience.\nThis study demonstrates that motion-based metrics can differentiate novice from trained users of flexible robotics systems for basic endovascular tasks. Efficiency of catheter movement, consistency of performance, and learning curves may help identify users who are sufficiently trained for safe clinical use of the system. This work will help identify the learning curve and specific movements that translate to expert robotic navigation.",

The patient is frail but active with no important comorbidities. The anatomy demands an open procedure. The patient is a former renowned physician who has been a longtime family friend of Dr Droit-like a grandfather. He presented incoherent with sagging blood pressure. A complicating factor is that Dr D. Rag, the chief anesthesiologist, decided that neither he nor any of his staff would provide anesthesia. Dr Droit knows an anesthesiologist who handles high-risk patients at another hospital in the medical center. The patient has worsened over the last hour, is becoming more unstable, and is unable to respond but his wife wishes to consent for surgery. What should Dr Droit do?",

    "abstract": "The practice of using fenestrated endografts to treat juxtarenal and group IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) has become more accepted, but long-term outcomes are still unknown. We report long-term survival, complications, and branch-related outcomes from a single-center experience.\nThe study included consecutive patients enrolled prospectively into a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption classified as undergoing group IV TAAA or juxtarenal aneurysm repair by the treating surgeon using fenestrated endografts. Device morphology was used to subclassify this group of patients. Long-term survival and a composite outcome of secondary intervention, branch occlusion, stent migration, endoleak, aneurysm growth, or spinal cord injury were calculated. Descriptive analysis of branch-related outcomes and need for any reintervention was performed. Univariate and multivariate analysis of mortality and the composite outcome was performed to determine associative risks.\nLong-term survival for patients with juxtarenal and group IV TAAA aneurysms treated with fenestrated stent grafts was 20% at 8 years. Multivariate analysis showed long-term survival for this patient population was negatively associated with increasing age, congestive heart failure, cancer, and previous aneurysm repair. The risk of spinal cord ischemia (SCI) in this group was 1.2% and of aortic-related mortality was 2%. The risk of a spinal event increased with coverage above the celiac artery (52 mm of coverage above the celiac artery in patients with SCI vs 33 mm without SCI; P = .099). More complex device configurations were more likely to require an increased rate of reinterventions, and patients with celiac fenestrations were more likely to experience celiac occlusion over time (3.5% vs 0.5%; P = .019). However, less complex designs were complicated by an increased risk of type I endoleak over time (10.4% for renal fenestrations only vs 1.9% for others; P < .01). As experience evolved, there was a trend to increase the number of fenestrations in devices treating the same anatomy.\nThe use of fenestrated devices to treat juxtarenal and group IV TAAA is safe and effective in long-term follow-up. Mortality in this patient population is largely not aortic-related. Devices designed for fenestrated repair of juxtarenal and group IV thoracoabdominal aneurysms within a physician sponsored investigational device exemption have changed over time. Further research is needed to determine the best configuration to treat aneurysms requiring coverage proximal to the celiac artery.",

    "abstract": "Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Systemic anticoagulation is the standard of care, and treatment can be escalated in the setting of massive or submassive PE, given the high mortality risk. A secondary consideration for intervention is the prevention of late-onset chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Treatment options include systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed interventions, and surgical thromboembolectomy. Whereas systemic thrombolysis seems to be beneficial in the setting of massive PE, it appears to be associated with a higher rate of major complications compared with catheter-directed thrombolysis as shown in recent randomized trials for submassive PE. The hemodynamic and clinical outcomes continue to be defined to determine the indications for and benefits of intervention. The current review summarizes contemporary evidence on the role and outcomes of catheter-directed therapies in the treatment of acute massive and submassive PE.",

Our objective was to investigate the role of perioperative statin therapy in noncardiac vascular and endovascular surgery.\nElectronic information sources were systematically searched to identify studies comparing outcomes after noncardiac surgical or endovascular arterial reconstruction in patients who were and were not taking statin in the perioperative or peri-interventional period. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used to assess the methodologic quality and risk of bias of the selected studies. Random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data.\nFour randomized controlled trials and 20 observational cohort or case-control studies were selected for analysis. The randomized studies enrolled 675 patients, and the observational studies enrolled 22,861 patients. Statin therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% CI, [CI], 0.38-0.78), myocardial infarction (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.87), stroke (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.39-0.67), and the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70). No significant differences in cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.41-1.63) and the incidence of kidney injury (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.58-1.39) between the groups were identified.\nOur analysis demonstrated that statin therapy is beneficial in improving operative and interventional outcomes and should be considered as part of the optimization strategy for prevention of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and death.",

    "abstract": "Neurologic dysfunction remains a persistent complication of extensive aortic repair owing to disruption of the spinal collateral network. We hypothesized that staged repair might mitigate the incidence and severity of this spinal cord ischemia (SCI).\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing a Crawford type II repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm between January 2008 and July 2013. Baseline demographics, incidence of prior aortic surgery, comorbidities, and outcomes were prospectively recorded. Staged repair was defined as intentional completion of the endovascular repair as two temporally separate procedures, referred to as a two-stage repair. Extent of aortic cover was calculated by three-dimensional imaging and reported as the proportion of the aorta covered between the left subclavian artery and the aortic bifurcation. Primary outcome measures were incidence and severity of SCI and mortality.\nThe study included 87 patients, divided into the following subgroups: single-stage repair (n = 32; repair in a single procedure, without prior aortic surgery), two-stage repair (n = 27; repair in two separate procedures, without prior aortic surgery), and unintentionally staged repair (n = 28; those with prior aortic surgery, without an intention to stage). Median time between stages was 5 months (range, 1-60 months). All groups were equivalent in terms of demographics and risk factors; however, the staged group had significantly greater proximal aortic cover (P = .001). The overall rates of SCI in the nonstaged and staged groups were 37.5% (12 of 32) and 11.1% (3 of 27), respectively (P = .03). Furthermore, all neurologic injuries in the staged group were temporary. The 30-day survival in the single-stage, two-stage, and unintentionally staged repairs was 18.8%, 0%, and 10.7%, respectively (P = .52).\nStaged repair appears both to protect against SCI and to enhance overall survival in extensive aortic repair.",

Patients underwent functional multidimensional contrast-enhanced MRI with flow analysis or compliance measurements of the aorta, or both. Ten patients were treated with the Medtronic Valiant (Medtronic World Medical, Sunrise, Fla), 14 patients received a Gore TAG (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), and two received a C (conformable)-TAG (W. L. Gore & Associates) stent graft. For several patients, repetitive measurements over time could be done. Median follow-up was 3.92 \u00b1 2.7 years. The MRI parameters were: three-dimensional flow: echo time/repetition time = 3.1/5.3 ms, \u0394x(pixel density) = 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 3 mm(3); respiratory navigator, \u03b1 = 15\u00b0, venc(encoding velocity) = 200 cm/s along anterior-posterior, right-left, and foot-head direction, 40 cardiac phases.

    "abstract": "This study analyzed total aortic arch reconstruction in a contemporary comparison of current open and endovascular repair.\nEndovascular (group 1) and open arch procedures (group 2) performed during 2007 to 2013 were entered in a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed. Endovascular repair (proximal landing zones 0-1), with or without a hybrid adjunct, was selected for patients with a high comorbidity profile and fit anatomy. Operations involving coverage of left subclavian artery only (zone 2 proximal landing: n = 41) and open hemiarch replacement (n = 434) were excluded. Early and midterm mortality and major complications were assessed.\nOverall, 100 (78 men; mean age, 68 years) consecutive procedures were analyzed: 29 patients in group 2 and 71 in group 1. Seven group 1 patients were treated with branched or chimney stent graft, and 64 with partial or total debranching and straight stent graft. The 29 patients in group 2 were younger (mean age, 61.9 vs 70.3; P = .005), more frequently females (48.2% vs 11.3; P < .001) with less cardiac (6.9% vs 38.2%; P = .001), hypertensive (58.5% vs 88.4%; P = .002), and peripheral artery (0% vs 16.2%; P = .031) disease. At 30 days, there were six deaths in group 1 and four in group 2 (8.5% vs 13.8%; odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-6.66; P = .47), and four strokes in group 1 and one in group 2 (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-5.59; P = 1). Spinal cord ischemia occurred in two group 1 patients and in no group 2 patients. Three retrograde dissections (1 fatal) were detected in group 1. During a mean follow-up of 26.2 months, two type I endoleaks and three reinterventions were recorded in group 1 (all for persistent endoleak), and one reintervention was performed in group 2. According to Kaplan Meier estimates, survival at 4 years was 79.8% in group 1 and 69.8% in group 2 (P = .62), and freedom from late reintervention was 94.6% and 95.5%, respectively (P = .82).\nDespite the older age and a higher comorbidity profile in patients with challenging aortic arch disease suitable and selected for endovascular arch repair, no significant differences were detected in perioperative and 4-year outcomes compared with the younger patients undergoing open arch total repair. An endovascular approach might also be a valid alternative to open surgery in average-risk patients with aortic arch diseases requiring 0 to 1 landing zones, when morphologically feasible. However, larger concurrent comparison and longer follow-up are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity bypass surgery has been widely performed to treat critical limb ischemia (CLI) in patients on hemodialysis (HD). However, the clinical outcome still remains unclear. We investigated the limb salvage rate after infrapopliteal bypass surgery in HD patients with CLI.\nFrom April 2006 to January 2013, 226 patients with 236 limbs who electively underwent bypass surgery for treatment of CLI due to infrapopliteal disease were enrolled. Patients were grouped by those who were on HD (n = 177) and those who were not (n = 49). They were monitored for 5 years or until December 2013 if the follow-up period was <5 years. Amputation-free survival, defined as freedom from major amputation or all-cause death, was primarily evaluated. Incidence of reintervention was also analyzed.\nUlcer/gangrene was present in 206 patients (91.2%), and 233 limbs (98.7%) were treated using autogenous vein. Age was younger (67 \u00b1 9 vs 72 \u00b1 9 years; P = .0011) and ulcer/gangrene was more prevalent (93.8% vs 81.6%, P = .0080) in HD patients than in non-HD patients. During the follow-up period (median, 28 months), 33 (14.6%) major amputations and 28 reinterventions (12.4%) occurred, and 65 patients (28.8%) died. The 5-year amputation-free survival rate was significantly lower in HD patients than in non-HD patients (43.6% vs 78.8%, P = .0033), and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for amputation or death for HD patients was 2.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-4.92; P = .022). Compared with non-HD patients, the status of HD was similarly an independent risk of major amputation (72.4% vs 92.5%; adjusted HR, 4.36; 95% CI, 1.04-18.3; P = .045) and mortality (56.9% vs 83.2%; adjusted HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.30-6.09; P = .0085). However, freedom from reintervention was comparable between the two groups (84.3% vs 86.8%; P = .89). In HD patients, body mass index (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.96; per 1 kg/m(2) increase; P = .014) and C-reactive protein (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .014) independently predicted major amputation. Elevated C-reactive protein levels were also associated with death (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .047).\nThe clinical outcome after infrapopliteal bypass surgery was poorer in HD patients with CLI compared with non-HD patients. Malnutrition or chronic inflammation was associated with poor outcome in HD patients with CLI due to infrapopliteal occlusive disease.",

During the follow-up period (median, 28 months), 33 (14.6%) major amputations and 28 reinterventions (12.4%) occurred, and 65 patients (28.8%) died. The 5-year amputation-free survival rate was significantly lower in HD patients than in non-HD patients (43.6% vs 78.8%, P = .0033), and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for amputation or death for HD patients was 2.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-4.92; P = .022).

    "abstract": "Previous studies have proved the feasibility of performing a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple operation) in patients with portal vein-superior mesenteric vein and hepatic artery invasion. We report our institutional experience with the use of a variety of vascular reconstructive methods during pancreatic resections for adenocarcinoma.\nA retrospective review was performed identifying all patients undergoing a Whipple operation or total pancreatectomy procedure from January 2003 to December 2013. All venous (portal vein-superior mesenteric vein) and arterial (superior mesenteric artery-hepatic artery) reconstructions were extracted and reviewed to determine survival and perioperative complications.\nDuring the 10-year study period, 270 Whipple and total pancreatectomy procedures were performed, of which 183 were for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Of the 183 operations, a total of 60 (32.8%) vascular reconstructions were found, 49 venous and 11 arterial. Venous reconstruction included 37 (61.7%) primary repairs, four (6.7%) reconstructions with CryoVein (CryoLife, Inc, Kennesaw, Ga), three (5.0%) repairs with autologous vein patch, three (5.0%) autologous saphenous reconstructions, and two (3.33%) portacaval shunts. In addition, there were 11 (18.3%) arterial reconstructions (seven hepatic artery and four superior mesenteric artery). The 1-year survival for all reconstructions was 71.1%, which is equivalent to T3 lesions that did not receive vascular reconstruction (70.11%), with a median survival time of 575.28 days and 12 patients still alive. Survival time was comparable with each type of venous reconstruction, averaging 528 days (11 of 49 patients still alive). There was a total thrombosis rate of seven of 60 (11.6%), all of which were portal vein thrombosis: three in the primary repair group and four delayed thromboses seen in primary repair, CryoVein repair, and vein patch repair. There was no thrombosis in any patients after arterial reconstruction.\nAn aggressive approach for stage II pancreatic cancers with venous or arterial invasion can be performed with comparable results when it is executed by an experienced institution with skilled oncologic and vascular surgeons.",

Unstable atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by a large necrotic core. In this study we investigated the distribution and interaction between gene polymorphisms encoding proinflammatory molecules in an Italian population with internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS). We also evaluated whether reciprocal interaction between these gene polymorphisms increased the risk of plaque vulnerability.\nIn this genetic association study, 11 proinflammatory gene polymorphisms were analyzed in 933 individuals comprising 344 patients with ICAS who underwent carotid endarterectomy and 589 controls without ultrasound evidence of atherosclerosis or intimal thickening.\nWe found that interleukin (IL) 6 (IL-6), IL-1\u03b2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (CCL3), E-selectin (SELE), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and 9 (MMP-9) gene variants were independently and significantly associated with ICAS. The association remained significant even after the Bonferroni correction. We also found a genetic profile associated with different risks for ICAS, depending on the number of high-risk genotypes simultaneously present in an individual. Furthermore, proinflammatory genetic profiles are significantly more common in individuals with unstable carotid plaque.\nOur study shows, for the first time, a reciprocal interaction between proinflammatory genotypes for the development and progression of ICAS.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysm-related complications could lead to loss of a functioning arteriovenous fistula (AVF). We report our midterm and long-term results with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique to repair and preserve aneurysmal AVFs.\nWe retrospectively reviewed our surgical treatment of patients with aneurysmal autogenous AVF complicated by skin erosion, bleeding, infection, pain, and difficulty with needle access from 2007 through 2014. We identified 52 patients, 40 (77%) of whom underwent repair with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique. The operation involved mobilizing the entire aneurysmal segments. A TA (Covidien, Norwalk, Conn) or Endo GIA (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass) stapler was used to resect the redundant aneurysm wall to create a 6- to 8-mm-diameter conduit. A subcutaneous skin flap was created after excising compromised skin. The remodeled vein was repositioned underneath the subcutaneous flap, with the staple line rotated laterally to avoid needle puncture.\nWe attempted staple aneurysmorrhaphy in 40 patients with complicated AVF aneurysms, of which 38 repairs (95%) were successful. Median patient age was 66 years (range, 29-88 years). Median AVF age was 63 months (range, 12-136 months). Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 5-81 months). At 1 year, primary patency was 67%, assisted primary patency was 88%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 2 years, primary patency was 59%, assisted primary patency was 84%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 3 years, primary patency was 46%, assisted primary patency was 69%, and secondary patency was 85%. Surgery was performed under local-regional anesthesia in 28 patients (70%) and under general anesthesia in the remaining 12 (30%). Proximal venous outflow stenoses were detected in 19 of 40 AVFs (48%) preoperatively and in 11 of 38 AVFs (29%) postoperatively. Aneurysm recurrence occurred in two repaired AVFs.\nOur experience with staple aneurysmorrhaphy shows that it is an effective, safe, and durable procedure to preserve a functioning autogenous AVF with complicated aneurysmal degeneration. Key principles are to reduce the vein to normal adjacent diameter and to provide healthy skin coverage. The remodeled AVF has a low aneurysm recurrence rate and maintains the beneficial properties of superior patency and low infection. It is important to aggressively monitor for and treat proximal outflow venous stenoses to prevent aneurysm recurrence. The surgery can be done safely under local anesthesia in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Supervised exercise therapy (SET) is recommended as the primary treatment for patients with intermittent claudication (IC). However, there is concern regarding the safety of performing SET because IC patients are at risk for untoward cardiovascular events. The Dutch physical therapy guideline advocates cardiac exercise testing before SET, if indicated. Perceived uncertainties concerning safety may contribute to the underuse of SET in daily practice. The objective of this review was to analyze the safety of supervised exercise training in patients with IC.\nTwo authors independently studied clinical trials investigating SET. Data were obtained from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Complication rates were calculated and expressed as number of events per number of patient-hours. The usefulness of cardiac screening before SET was evaluated in a subanalysis.\nOur search strategy revealed 2703 abstracts. We selected 121 articles, of which 74 met the inclusion criteria. Studies represent 82,725 hours of training in 2876 IC patients. Eight adverse events were reported, six of cardiac and two of noncardiac origin, resulting in an all-cause complication rate of one event per 10,340 patient-hours.\nSET can safely be prescribed in patients with IC because an exceedingly low all-cause complication rate was found. Routine cardiac screening before commencing SET is not required. Our results may diminish perceived uncertainties regarding safety and will possibly increase the use of SET in daily practice.",

    "abstract": "Frailty, defined as a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors, has been linked to adverse outcomes after surgery. We evaluated the effect of frailty on 30-day mortality, morbidity, and failure to rescue (FTR) in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nPatients undergoing elective endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) or open AAA repair (OAR) were identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for the years 2005 to 2012. Frailty was assessed using the modified frailty index (mFI) derived from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included 30-day morbidity and FTR. The effect of frailty on outcomes was assessed by multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class, and significant comorbidities.\nOf 23,207 patients, 339 (1.5% overall; 1.0% EVAR and 3.0% OAR) died \u226430 days of repair. One or more complications occurred in 2567 patients (11.2% overall; 7.8% EVAR and 22.1% OAR). Odds ratios (ORs) for mortality adjusted for age, ASA class, and other comorbidities in the group with the highest frailty score were 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.0) after EVAR and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.4-3.7) after OAR. Similarly, compared with the least frail, the most frail patients were significantly more likely to experience severe (Clavien-Dindo class IV) complications after EVAR (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.1) and OAR (OR, 1.8; 95%, CI, 1.5-2.1). There was also a higher FTR rate among frail patients, with 1.7-fold higher risk odds of mortality (95% CI, 1.2-2.5) in the highest tertile of frailty compared with the lowest when postoperative complications occurred.\nHigher mFI, independent of other risk factors, is associated with higher mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing elective EVAR and OAR. The mortality in frail patients is further driven by FTR from postoperative complications. Preoperative recognition of frailty may serve as a useful adjunct for risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Although drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) have shown promising results treating de novo (DN) atherosclerotic lesions and appear to have been widely adopted in Europe, their long-term efficacy in the broad spectrum of femoropopliteal restenosis (RE) remains to be proven. The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of paclitaxel-DEBs in restenotic (stented and nonstented) vs DN stenotic femoropopliteal arteries.\nThe study prospectively enrolled 100 patients undergoing femoropopliteal endovascular intervention by DEB for RE or DN stenosis. Patients who received additive atherectomy were excluded. The primary end point was the primary patency (PP) rate at 12 months. Secondary end points were sustained clinical improvement and clinically driven target lesion revascularization.\nDEBs were used to treat 105 limbs for intermittent claudication (82 [78%]) or critical limb ischemia (23 [22%]) in 100 patients. Of these, 111 lesions were DN stenosis (46 [41%]) or RE (65 [59%]). The overall PP was 86% at 6 months and 74% at 12 months. PP of DN stenosis was higher at 6 months (93% vs 81%) and was significantly (P = .021) better than RE at 12 months (85% vs 68%). Sustained clinical improvement based on Rutherford classification was significant in both groups (P < .001). Target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in DN stenosis compared with RE at 12 months (15% vs 32%; P = .021).\nDEB angioplasty is an effective therapy for DN femoropopliteal lesions. The results of DEB angioplasty for RE are inferior compared with DN stenosis after 12 months. Nevertheless, results of DEB angioplasty for RE seem comparable with technically more demanding literature-derived strategies.",

    "abstract": "We sought to elucidate the risks for access site-related complications (ASCs) after percutaneous lower extremity revascularization and to evaluate the benefit of routine ultrasound-guided access (RUS) in decreasing ASCs.\nWe reviewed all consecutive percutaneous revascularizations (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stent) performed for lower extremity atherosclerosis at our institution from 2002 to 2012. RUS began in September 2007. Primary outcome was any ASC (bleeding, groin or retroperitoneal hematoma, vessel rupture, or thrombosis). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of ASC.\nA total of 1371 punctures were performed on 877 patients (43% women; median age, 69 [interquartile range, 60-78] years) for claudication (29%), critical limb ischemia (59%), or bypass graft stenosis (12%) with 4F to 8F sheaths. There were 72 ASCs (5%): 52 instances of bleeding or groin hematoma, nine pseudoaneurysms, eight retroperitoneal hematomas, two artery lacerations, and one thrombosis. ASCs were less frequent when RUS was used (4% vs 7%; P = .02). Multivariable predictors of ASC were age >75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.7; P = .03), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3; P = .02), preoperative warfarin use (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .02), and RUS (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P < .01).

RUS lowered ASCs in those >75 years (5% vs 12%; P < .01) but not in those taking warfarin preoperatively (10% vs 13%; P = .47). RUS did not decrease VCD failure (6% vs 4%; P = .79).\nWe were able to decrease the rate of ASCs during lower extremity revascularization with the implementation of RUS. VCDs did not affect ASCs.

Multivariable predictors of ASC were age >75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.7; P = .03), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3; P = .02), preoperative warfarin use (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .02), and RUS (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P < .01). Vascular closure devices (VCDs) were not associated with lower rates of ASCs (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6-1.9; P = .79). RUS lowered ASCs in those >75 years (5% vs 12%; P < .01) but not in those taking warfarin preoperatively (10% vs 13%; P = .47). RUS did not decrease VCD failure (6% vs 4%; P = .79).",

    "abstract": "Side-clamping of the ascending aorta is an indispensable technique for proximal anastomosis in total debranching of supra-aortic trunks and in endovascular aneurysm repair for arch aneurysm. However, this procedure may lead to the dislodging of multiple plaques and to clamp injury of the ascending aorta. We developed a clampless technique to achieve proximal anastomosis between the ascending aorta and an artificial graft used for total debranching of supra-aortic trunks. We applied this method in six patients with arch aneurysm and a plaque-rich ascending aorta and were able to achieve total debranching of the supra-aortic trunks in all of the patients without side-clamping the ascending aorta and no procedurally related complications. This clampless anastomosis technique (\"real chimney technique\") in the ascending aorta is a valuable option for total debranching of supra-aortic trunks in the hybrid repair of arch aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the effects of operative indication, anatomy, and stent graft on type I endoleak occurrence after thoracic endovascular aortic repair.\nA retrospective review was conducted of patients admitted for thoracic endovascular aortic repair between 2007 and 2013. All computed tomography angiography imaging was analyzed for the presence of endoleak and measurement of diameters and lengths. Variables studied included underlying disease, emergency, achieved aortic neck length, difference between proximal and distal neck diameters, landing zone 2, and stent graft characteristics (diameter, number, type of device, oversizing degree, and covered aorta length).\nThe study population involved 84 patients (mean age, 56 years; range, 17-94 years) who were treated for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) (n = 29; 34.5%), traumatic aortic rupture (n = 27; 32%), type B aortic dissection (n = 19; 22.5%), intramural hematoma (n = 2; 2%), penetrating aortic ulcer (n = 5; 6%), and aortoesophageal fistula (n = 2; 2%). Of these, 60 patients (71.5%) were treated emergently and 24 (28.5%) electively. Primary type I endoleak was noted in eight patients (9.5%), of which two resolved spontaneously. After a mean follow-up of 32 months (range, 3-76 months), secondary type I endoleak was detected in four patients (4.5%). All of them occurred after emergent TAA treatment. Comparison between emergent and elective groups revealed no significant differences in neck length (19.5 mm vs 26.5 mm; P = .197), oversizing degree (11.1% vs 10.9%; P = .811), or endoleak rates (13.3% vs 8.3%; P = .518). Hemorrhagic shock was not predictive of endoleak (P = .483). Cox regression analysis of the different anatomic and stent graft-related factors revealed short proximal landing zone as the unique independent predictor of type I endoleak (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.99; P = .032).\nEndoleak risk seems not to be increased by an emergency setting. However, the relatively high rate of late endoleak observed after emergent TAA repair advocates for close follow-up, contrary to traumatic aortic rupture. Furthermore, regardless of the pathologic process, a longer proximal landing zone is likely to guarantee early and late success.",

    "abstract": "Conventional wisdom holds that patients with a need for intervention for femoropopliteal occlusive disease at a younger age have more aggressive disease, although there is a paucity of support in the literature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this assumption.\nA retrospective cohort of patients undergoing endovascular or open revascularization for femoropopliteal occlusive disease for critical limb ischemia during a 4-year period was assembled. Demographic information, comorbidities, disease characteristics, and time to last follow-up, repeat intervention, amputation, or death was recorded. The patients were stratified by age into a young (\u226455 years) group, middle (56-77 years) group, and elderly (\u226578 years) group. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were used to evaluate the primary outcome.\nThe study included 124 patients with a mean age of 64.4 \u00b1 0.8 years. Progression to reintervention or amputation occurred in 50% of the patients during the follow-up period, with 18% dying before having an outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a trend toward significance (P = .06) in time to reintervention, amputation, or death among the three groups, with time to event of 253, 1083, and 504 days for the young, middle, and elderly groups, respectively. However, differences based on age were not significant (P = .57) in Cox regression analysis.\nThere does not appear to be an association between time to reintervention and patient age.",

    "abstract": "The optimal timing for repair of a high-grade blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is uncertain. Delayed repair is common and associated with improved outcomes, but some lesions may rupture during observation. To determine optimal patient selection for appropriate management, we developed a pilot clinical risk score to evaluate aortic stability and predict rupture.\nPatients presenting in stable condition with Society for Vascular Surgery grade III or IV BTAI diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) were retrospectively reviewed. To determine clinical and radiographic factors associated with aortic rupture, patients progressing to aortic rupture (defined by contrast extravasation on CT or on operative or autopsy findings) were compared with those who had no intervention \u226448 hours of admission. A model targeting 100% sensitivity for rupture was generated and internally validated by bootstrap analysis. Clinical utility was tested by comparison with clinical assessment by surgeons experienced in BTAI management who were provided with CT images and clinical data but were blinded to outcome.\nThe derivation cohort included 18 patients whose aorta ruptured and 31 with stable BTAI. There was no difference in age, gender, injury mechanism, nonchest injury severity, blood pressure, or Glasgow Coma Scale on admission between patient groups. As dichotomous factors, admission lactate >4 mM, posterior mediastinal hematoma >10 mm, and lesion/normal aortic diameter ratio >1.4 on the admission CT were independently associated with aortic rupture. The model had an area under the receiver operator curve of .97, and in the presence of any two factors, was 100% sensitive and 84% specific for predicting aortic rupture. No aortic lesions ruptured in patients with fewer than two factors. In contrast, clinical assessment had lower accuracy (65% vs 90% total accuracy, P < .01).\nThis novel risk score can be applied on admission using clinically relevant factors that incorporate patient physiology, size of the aortic lesion, and extent of the mediastinal hematoma. The model reliably identifies and distinguishes patients with high-grade BTAI who are at risk for early rupture from those with stable lesions. Although preliminary, because it is more accurate than clinical assessment alone, the score may improve patient selection for emergency or delayed intervention.",

The median diameter on initial examination was 40 mm, and the median growth rate of the AAAs was 2.1 mm/y. The growth rate of AAAs with an initial diameter \u226545 mm was significantly greater than those with an initial diameter <45 mm (3.3 mm/y vs 2.0 mm/y, respectively; P = .007). The growth rate of AAAs was significantly greater in patients with hypertension than in those without (2.3 mm/y vs 1.7 mm/y, respectively; P = .006) and in patients with a family history of aortic aneurysm than in those without (4.2 mm/y vs 2.0 mm/y, respectively; P = .009). Logistic regression analysis revealed that a large initial diameter and family history of aortic aneurysm were independent predictors of accelerated growth rate of small AAAs in Japan.\nIn the present study, a large initial diameter and family history of aortic aneurysm were independent risk factors for more rapid growth of small AAAs. Although few studies have reported similar findings thus far, family history of aortic aneurysm should be carefully considered during follow-up of patients with small AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular surgery has revolutionized the treatment of aortic aneurysms; however, these improvements have come at the cost of increased radiation and contrast exposure, particularly for more complex procedures. Three-dimensional (3D) fusion computed tomography (CT) imaging is a new technology that may facilitate these repairs. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the effect of using intraoperative 3D fusion CT on the performance of fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (FEVAR).\nOur institutional database was reviewed to identify patients undergoing branched or FEVAR. Patients treated using 3D fusion CT were compared with patients treated in the immediate 12-month period before implementation of this technology when procedures were performed in a standard hybrid operating room without CT fusion capabilities. Primary end points included patient radiation exposure (cumulated air kerma: mGy), fluoroscopy time (minutes), contrast usage (mL), and procedure time (minutes). Patients were grouped by the number of aortic graft fenestrations revascularized with a stent graft, and operative outcomes were compared.\nA total of 72 patients (41 before vs 31 after 3D fusion CT implementation) underwent FEVAR from September 2012 through March 2014. For two-vessel fenestrated endografts, there was a significant decrease in radiation exposure (3400 \u00b1 1900 vs 1380 \u00b1 520 mGy; P = .001), fluoroscopy time (63 \u00b1 29 vs 41 \u00b1 11 minutes; P = .02), and contrast usage (69 \u00b1 16 vs 26 \u00b1 8 mL; P = .0002) with intraoperative 3D fusion CT. Similarly, for combined three-vessel and four-vessel FEVAR, significantly decreased radiation exposure (5400 \u00b1 2225 vs 2700 \u00b1 1400 mGy; P < .0001), fluoroscopy time (89 \u00b1 36 vs 64 \u00b1 21 minutes; P = .02), contrast usage (90 \u00b1 25 vs 39 \u00b1 17 mL; P < .0001), and procedure time (330 \u00b1 100 vs 230 \u00b1 50 minutes; P = .002) was noted. Estimated blood loss was significantly less (P < .0001), and length of stay had a trend (P = .07) toward being lower for all patients in the 3D fusion CT group.\nThese results demonstrate that use of intraoperative 3D fusion CT imaging during FEVAR can significantly decrease radiation exposure, procedure time, and contrast usage, which may also decrease the overall physiologic impact of the repair.",

    "abstract": "Risk of death in dialysis patients is lowest with arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), followed by arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and then intravenous hemodialysis catheters (HCs). Our aim was to analyze the effects of age at hemodialysis initiation on mortality across different access types.\nAll patients \u226518 years in the United States Renal Data System between the years 2006 and 2010 were analyzed. Spline modeling and risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the effect of age on mortality for first dialysis access with AVF vs AVG vs HC.\nThe study analyzed 507,791 patients (63.4 \u00b1 0.02 years; 56.5% male; 40.9% mortality; follow-up, 1.57 \u00b1 1.36 years). Increasing age was a significant predictor of overall mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.03; P < .001). Compared with patients with HCs (n = 418,932), overall risk-adjusted mortality was lowest in patients with AVFs (n = 71,316; aHR, 0.63; P < .001) followed by AVGs (n = 17,543; aHR, 0.83; P < .001). AVF was superior to both HC and AVG for all age groups (P < .001). However, there was a significant change in the relative efficacy of AVG at ages 48 years and 89 years based on spline modeling; there were no significant differences comparing adjusted mortality with AVG vs HC for patients aged 18 to 48 years or for patients >89 years, but AVG was superior to HC for patients 49 to 89 years of age (aHR, 0.811; P < .001). The mortality benefit of AVF was consistently superior to that of AVG and HC for patients of all ages (all, P < .001).\nAVF is superior to AVG and HC regardless of the patient's age, including in octogenarians. In contrast, the mortality benefit of AVG over HC may not apply to younger (18-48 years) or older (>89 years) age groups. All patients 18 to 48 years should receive AVF for dialysis access whenever possible.",

    "abstract": "Wound complications negatively affect outcomes of lower extremity arterial reconstruction. By way of an investigator initiated clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that a silver-eluting alginate topical surgical dressing would lower wound complication rates in patients undergoing open arterial procedures in the lower extremity.\nThe study block-randomized 500 patients at three institutions to standard gauze or silver alginate dressings placed over incisions after leg arterial surgery. This original operating room dressing remained until gross soiling, clinical need to remove, or postoperative day 3, whichever was first. Subsequent care was at the provider's discretion. The primary end point was 30-day wound complication incidence generally based on National Surgical Quality Improvement Program guidelines. Demographic, clinical, quality of life, and economic end points were also collected. Wound closure was at the surgeon's discretion.\nParticipants (72% male) were 84% white, 45% were diabetic, 41% had critical limb ischemia, and 32% had claudication (with aneurysm, bypass revision, other). The overall 30-day wound complication incidence was 30%, with superficial surgical site infection as the most common. In intent-to-treat analysis, silver alginate had no effect on wound complications. Multivariable analysis showed that Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ; odds ratio [OR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.87; P = .03), higher body mass index (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .01), and the use of no conduit/material (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.82-3.59; P < .001) were independently associated with wound complications.\nThe incidence of wound complications remains high in contemporary open lower extremity arterial surgery.

    "abstract": "The indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is uncertain in patients with asymptomatic severe (\u226560% luminal narrowing according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria) carotid stenosis (ASCS), especially in the very elderly, because current evidence suggests that the risk of future stroke has been dropping in the past two decades owing to the recent advances in medical therapy. The aim of this observational study was to compare early and late outcomes in patients \u226580 years old with ASCS treated with CEA plus best medical treatment (BMT) or with BMT alone.\nFrom 2005 to 2012, 69 octogenarians with ASCS underwent CEA plus BMT (group 1), and another 54 received BMT alone (group 2). All operations were eversion CEAs. BMT included lipid-lowering drugs, new antiplatelet and antihypertensive agents, avoidance of smoking, careful blood pressure and glycemic control, and lifestyle changes. Follow-up with serial ultrasonographic examination was obtained in 118 patients for a median 4.4-year period.\nThere were no perioperative (30-day) strokes or deaths and one transient ischemic attack (1.4%). One late minor stroke developed in a CEA patient (1.5%). No late restenoses or occlusions were detected. Five patients in group 2 (9.6%) became symptomatic (one transient ischemic attack and four minor strokes) and subsequently underwent successful CEA; all their carotid plaques were complicated by ulceration and intraplaque hemorrhage (with plaque progression in four cases), confirmed by computed tomography images. The rate of freedom from cerebral ischemic events at 5 years showed a significant benefit for elderly patients who had CEA vis-\u00e0-vis those who did not (98% vs 84%; P = .04), and so did the 5-year rate of freedom from ipsilateral carotid disease progression (100% vs 91%; P = .01). At 5 years, the mortality rate was comparable for elderly patients whether they had CEA or not (66% vs 68%; P = .65).\nCEA is a safe, effective, and durable treatment for ASCS in patients aged 80 years or more, carrying an insignificant perioperative stroke/death risk. CEA associated with BMT seems preferable to BMT alone in preventing the risk of ipsilateral ischemic events, without translating into a longer survival.",

The rate of freedom from cerebral ischemic events at 5 years showed a significant benefit for elderly patients who had CEA vis-\u00e0-vis those who did not (98% vs 84%; P = .04), and so did the 5-year rate of freedom from ipsilateral carotid disease progression (100% vs 91%; P = .01).

    "abstract": "Previous reports have documented better outcomes after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in tertiary centers compared with lower-volume hospitals, but outcome variability for endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) vs open AAA repairs in a large tertiary center using a Medicare-derived mortality risk prediction model has not been previously reported. In the current study, we compared the observed vs predicted mortality after EVAR and open AAA repair in a single large tertiary vascular center.\nWe retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent repair of a nonruptured infrarenal AAA in our center from 2003 to 2012. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to evaluate 30-day mortality. Patients were stratified into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups, and mortality was predicted for each patient based on demographics and comorbidities according to the Medicare risk prediction model.\nWe analyzed 297 patients (EVAR, 72%; open AAA repair, 28%; symptomatic, 25%). Most of our patients were of high and moderate risk (48% and 28%, respectively). The observed 30-day mortality was 1.9% after EVAR vs 2.4% after open repair (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-4.29; P = .67). There was no difference in mortality with EVAR vs open repair after adjusting for predefined patient characteristics (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.16-7.43; P = .93); only preoperative renal disease was predictive of 30-day mortality after AAA repair in our cohort (OR, 8.39; 95% CI, 1.41-67.0). The observed mortality within our study was significantly lower than the Medicare-derived expected mortality for each treatment group within patients stratified as high risk or medium risk (P \u2264 .0002 for all).\nDespite treating patients with high preoperative risk status, we report a 10-fold decrease in operative mortality for EVAR and open AAA repair in a tertiary vascular center compared with national Medicare-derived predictions. High-risk patients should be considered for aneurysm management in dedicated aortic centers, regardless of approach.",

    "abstract": "Proximal aortic control by endovascular balloon occlusion (EBO) is an alternative to conventional aortic cross-clamping (CAC) in hemodynamically unstable patients presenting with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of EBO over CAC.\nData from 72 patients with rAAA treated at our institution from 2001 to 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were hemodynamically unstable (mean arterial blood pressure at admission <65 mm Hg or associated unconsciousness, cardiac arrest, or emergency endotracheal intubation). Clinical end points of hemodynamic restoration, mortality rate, and major postoperative complications were assessed for CAC (group 1) and EBO (group 2).\nAt admission, 72 patients were unstable. CAC was performed in 40 and EBO in 32. Intraoperative mortality was 43% in group 1 vs 19% in group 2 (P = .031). In group 1, the approach for CAC (thoracotomy [n = 23] vs laparotomy [n = 17]) did not influence intraoperative mortality (43% vs 41%). There was no significant difference in 30-day (75% vs 62%) and in-hospital (77% vs 69%) mortality rates between groups. After EBO, the treatment-open vs endovascular repair-did not influence the intraoperative mortality rate (31% vs 43%; P = .5). Eight surgical complications were secondary to CAC (1 vena cava injury, 3 left renal vein injuries, 1 left renal artery injury, 1 pancreaticoduodenal vein injury, and 2 splenectomies), but no EBO-related complication was noted (P = .04). Differences in colon ischemia (15% vs 28%) and renal failure (12% vs 9%) were not statistically significant. Abdominal compartment syndrome occurred in four patients in group 2 and in no patients in group 1.\nCompared with CAC, EBO is a feasible and valuable strategy and is associated with reduced intraoperative mortality of unstable rAAA patients, but not in-hospital mortality, in this retrospective study.",

Our purpose was to review our institution's experience with ECCAs during 15 years and to discuss the presentation and treatment of these aneurysms.\nA retrospective review of patients diagnosed with ECCAs from 1998 to 2012 was performed. Symptoms, risk factors, etiology, diagnostic methods, treatments, and outcomes were reviewed.\nDuring the study period, 141 aneurysms were diagnosed in 132 patients (mean age, 61 years; 69 men). There were 116 (82%) pseudoaneurysms and 25 (18%) true aneurysms; 69 (49%) aneurysms were asymptomatic, whereas 72 (52%) had symptoms (28 painless masses; 10 transient ischemic attacks; 10 vision symptoms; 9 ruptures; 8 strokes; 4 painful mass; 1 dysphagia; 1 tongue weakness; 1 bruit). Causes of true aneurysms included fibromuscular dysplasia in 15 patients, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in three, Marfan syndrome in one, and uncharacterized connective tissue diseases in two. Of 25 true aneurysms, 11 (44%) were symptomatic; 15 (60%) true aneurysms underwent open surgical treatment, whereas 10 (40%) were managed nonoperatively. Postoperative complications included one stroke during a mean follow-up of 31 months (range, 0-166 months). No aneurysms managed nonoperatively required intervention during a mean follow-up of 77 months (range, 1-115 months). Of 116 pseudoaneurysms, 60 (52%) were symptomatic; 33 (29%) pseudoaneurysms underwent open surgery, 18 (15%) underwent endovascular intervention, and 65 (56%) were managed medically. Pseudoaneurysm after endarterectomy (28 patients; 24%) presented at a mean of 82 months from the surgical procedure. Mean follow-up for all aneurysms was 33.9 months. One (0.7%) aneurysm-related death occurred (rupture treated palliatively). No patient undergoing nonoperative management suffered death or major morbidity related to the aneurysm. Nonoperative management was more common in asymptomatic patients (71%) than in symptomatic patients (31%).\nECCAs are uncommon and may be manifested with varying symptoms. All segments of the carotid artery are susceptible, although the internal is most commonly affected. Open surgical intervention was more common in patients with symptoms and with true aneurysms. Patients with pseudoaneurysms were more likely to undergo endovascular intervention. Nonoperative treatment is safe in selected patients.",

Of 116 pseudoaneurysms, 60 (52%) were symptomatic; 33 (29%) pseudoaneurysms underwent open surgery, 18 (15%) underwent endovascular intervention, and 65 (56%) were managed medically. Pseudoaneurysm after endarterectomy (28 patients; 24%) presented at a mean of 82 months from the surgical procedure. Mean follow-up for all aneurysms was 33.9 months. One (0.7%) aneurysm-related death occurred (rupture treated palliatively). No patient undergoing nonoperative management suffered death or major morbidity related to the aneurysm. Nonoperative management was more common in asymptomatic patients (71%) than in symptomatic patients (31%).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate carbon dioxide digital subtraction angiography (CO2-DSA) as an option for the detection of endoleaks (ELs) in the endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedure.\nForty patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm who were scheduled to undergo EVAR were enrolled in the study. There were 35 men and five women (mean age, 77.9 years). All patients had both iodinated contrast conventional DSA (C-DSA) and CO2-DSA immediately after EVAR. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the ability of CO2-DSA to detect ELs. We also correlated with computed tomography findings 6 months after EVAR.\nC-DSA showed that 27 of the 40 patients (68%) had 28 ELs (type I, four; type II, 20; type III, three; type IV, one). CO2-DSA showed that 16 of the 40 patients (40%) had 17 ELs (type I, four; type II, 10; type III, three; type IV, none). For the prediction of direct ELs (type I and type III) with use of C-DSA as the criterion standard, CO2-DSA has a sensitivity of 1.0 and a specificity of 1.0. For the detection of persistent type II ELs (n = 11) with use of computed tomography findings 6 months from EVAR as the criterion standard, CO2-DSA has a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.97. C-DSA has a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.64.\nCO2-DSA is reliable for the detection of direct ELs and persistent type II ELs in EVAR. CO2-DSA can be an option to detect ELs in the EVAR procedure.",

    "abstract": "Persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgical treatment for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (nTOS) is a problem commonly encountered by high-volume referral centers. The mechanical etiology patterns at reoperation include (1) inadequate previous rib resection, (2) rib regrowth, (3) scar tissue formation, or (4) intact scalene muscle. Reoperative TOS surgery has significant potential morbidity, and therefore, careful patient selection and meticulous planning are required. This study evaluated the utility of multidetector computed tomography (CT) in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent or persistent nTOS.\nA retrospective record review was performed of a nTOS referral practice of patients treated from 2003 to 2012 to focus on patients reoperated on for recurrent or persistent symptoms. In 2003, a dedicated high-resolution multidetector TOS CT protocol was established to assist in clinical decision making and reoperative planning. A single designated radiologist interpreted all CT images. Imaging, patient clinical characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were reviewed.\nThe study group included 20 reoperations for recurrent (n = 15) or persistent (n = 5) symptoms. Mean age was 35 years, and 60% of redo cases were in women. Preoperative CT imaging demonstrated the following anatomic patterns: inadequate previous rib resection in 5 (25%), rib regrowth in 5 (25%), scar tissue formation in 10 (50%), and intact scalene muscle in 3 (15%). Operative findings concurred with preoperative imaging in 85% of patients. There were no neurovascular injuries and no major complications. At a mean follow-up of 43 months, improvement or resolution of symptoms was significant in nine patients (45%), moderate in seven (35%), and minimal in four (20%).\nRecurrent/persistent nTOS is an often-vexing problem with challenging solutions. These results demonstrate the utility of a TOS protocol CT scan in providing correlative objective findings and in assisting with reoperative planning. Positive radiographic findings that correlate with patient symptoms inform the decision to reoperate.",

    "abstract": "The radial approach is currently gaining popularity in the setting of coronary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) because it decreases the incidence of vascular complications. This study reports our initial results with radial access for peripheral PTA.\nBetween November 2011 and January 2014, we performed peripheral PTA in 526 patients. PTA was performed through left radial access in 24 ambulatory patients (4.6%) presenting with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus A or B lesions on preoperative computed tomography angiography. Materials included a 110-cm-long introducer, a 0.018-inch 400-cm-long wire, 150-cm-long angiography catheters, 180-cm-long shaft balloons and stents. Data were prospectively collected.\nThere were 22 men (92%), median age was 65 years (range, 45-88 years), and 38 target lesions were treated. Indication for revascularization was disabling claudication in 22 patients (92%) and critical ischemia in two (8%). Indication for choosing the radial approach was bilateral hostile groins in 12 patients (50%), bilateral infrainguinal lesions in 4 (17%), need for a contralateral femoral approach in the setting of kissing iliac stents or bifurcated surgical aortic grafts in 3 (13%), and elective in 5 (21%). Radial puncture failed in one patient (4%), and PTA was performed through brachial access. Technical success was 91% (20 of 22 patients). Thirty-seven stents were implanted. Total procedure duration was 45 minutes (range, 30-120 minutes). Fluoroscopy time was 9 minutes (range, 5-35 minutes), and 40 mL (range, 20-90 mL) of contrast was necessary. Radial artery rupture secondary to spasm was noted at the end of the procedure in two patients (8%). All patients could ambulate 2 hours after the procedure. No patient died. Median follow-up was 8 months (range, 1-23 months). Three radial arteries (13%) were occluded at the last follow-up. At 6 months, freedom from target lesion revascularization and target vessel revascularization were 91% and 91%, respectively, for iliac lesions and 93% and 86%, respectively, for infrainguinal lesions.\nThis study demonstrates the feasibility of radial access for peripheral PTA. Radial access could represent an alternative to brachial access for peripheral and visceral interventions. Although complication rates of the present series are concerning, larger studies are needed to determine the role of transradial PTA once the learning curve is overcome. A wider diffusion of the technique mandates (1) smaller-diameter sheaths, (2) longer shaft devices, and (3) the development of specifically designed rescue devices such as covered stents and thromboaspiration catheters.",

Thirty-three fistulas received JXAS for failure to mature, and 35 were mature but inadequately dialyzing fistulas (problem fistulas). The JXAS technique involves (1) treating the JXA segment as a unit, (2) aggressive angioplasty with rupture of stenoses, and (3) placement of an uncovered nitinol stent.\nTechnical success was 97%. Of the fistulas that had failed to mature, 75% were brought to maturity by 6 months and 88% by 12 months. Adequate dialysis was achieved in all 35 problem fistulas immediately postoperatively. Assisted fistula patency was 90% at 2 years and 80% at 4 years.\nJXAS is an effective technique for maturing and maintaining the wrist radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula.",

    "abstract": "As first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, metformin has gained a strong position. In addition, type 2 diabetics benefit from the fact that metformin is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of information concerning the functional role of metformin in regulating angiogenesis. Our present study explores whether metformin is involved in the modulation of the revascularization processes in vivo by employing a hindlimb mice model of ischemia-induced angiogenesis.\nFor comparative purposes, randomly selected wild-type (WT) mice or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficient mice were assigned to one of two groups. One group was orally administered a daily dose of metformin through a gastric tube whereas the other group served as a control with no metformin administered. Both groups were subjected to unilateral hindlimb ischemia. Laser Doppler analysis coupled with capillary density staining with CD31was the method employed to determine revascularization. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and eNOS phosphorylation levels were assessed using Western blot analysis.\nSubsequent to hindlimb ischemic surgery, in comparison to the nontreated mice, metformin-treated WT mice showed accelerated limb perfusion, which was substantiated by laser Doppler blood-flow measurements and the presence of increased capillary density in the ischemic adductor muscle. Treatment with metformin significantly enhanced the increase in AMPK and eNOS phosphorylation levels of muscle tissues in WT mice induced by ischemia. In eNOS- deficient knockout mice, there was a significant increase in ischemic tissue AMPK phosphorylation induced by metformin; however, blood flow recovery in ischemic limb after surgery was unaffected.\nMetformin promoted revascularization in the presence of tissue ischemia through an AMPK/eNOS-related mechanism. Our study indicates that, in addition to its glucose-lowering effect, metformin fosters improved revascularization, which is responsible for its positive effect on patients with critical limb ischemia.",

Treatment with metformin significantly enhanced the increase in AMPK and eNOS phosphorylation levels of muscle tissues in WT mice induced by ischemia. In eNOS- deficient knockout mice, there was a significant increase in ischemic tissue AMPK phosphorylation induced by metformin; however, blood flow recovery in ischemic limb after surgery was unaffected.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the relationship between platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) activation and tissue factor (TF) RNA expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to mechanical and chemical stimulation.\nFifty percent confluent and 100% confluent HUVEC cultures were exposed to pulsatile forward flow, as a model for uniform flow, or pulsatile to-and-fro flow, as a model for disturbed flow, using a parallel-plate flow chamber system for up to 4 hours in the presence or absence of 4 U/mL thrombin. Protein lysates were immunoprecipitated for PECAM-1 and then immunoblotted with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody. TF RNA expression was determined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nHUVECs exposed to disturbed flow induced higher TF expression at 4 hours than HUVECs exposed to uniform flow in sparse cultures (16.8 \u00b1 5.8 vs 5.1 \u00b1 1.2; P < .05). HUVECs exposed to disturbed flow and thrombin induced higher TF RNA expression at 4 hours than cultures exposed to uniform flow and thrombin in both confluent (47.0 \u00b1 6.0 vs 30.2 \u00b1 4.9; P < .05) and sparse (72.3 \u00b1 10.7 vs 49.8 \u00b1 4.7; P < .05) cultures. In confluent HUVEC cultures, PECAM-1 is minimally phosphorylated by disturbed and uniform flow, while in sparse HUVEC cultures, PECAM-1 phosphorylation at 15 minutes is greater in both disturbed and uniform flow (2.0 \u00b1 0.2 and 2.1 \u00b1 0.4 respectively; P < .05). Thrombin treatment of static HUVECs exhibited greater PECAM-1 phosphorylation at 15 minutes in confluent compared with sparse cultures (3.0 \u00b1 0.5 vs 2.3 \u00b1 0.1; P < .05). PECAM-1 phosphorylation of HUVECs exposed to both flow and thrombin is significantly higher in sparse cultures compared with either flow or thrombin stimulation alone but was suppressed in confluent cultures.\nThe significantly higher TF RNA expression induced by disturbed flow and cell confluence indicates that suppression of PECAM-1 phosphorylation may be an important contributory mechanical signal pathway that promotes TF expression when HUVECs are exposed to disturbed flow.",

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal circulation (ECC) is regularly applied to maintain organ perfusion during major aortic and cardiovascular surgery. During thoracoabdominal aortic repair, ECC-driven selective visceral arterial perfusion (SVP) results in changed microcirculatory perfusion (shift from the muscularis toward the mucosal small intestinal layer) in conjunction with macrohemodynamic hypoperfusion. The underlying mechanism, however, is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess in a porcine model whether ECC itself or the hypoperfusion induced by SVP is responsible for the mucosal/muscular shift in the small intestinal wall.\nA thoracoabdominal aortic approach was performed in 15 healthy pigs divided equally into three groups: group I, control; group II, thoracic aortic cross-clamping with distal aortic perfusion; and group III, thoracic aortic cross-clamping with distal aortic perfusion and SVP. Macrocirculatory and microcirculatory blood flow was assessed by transit time ultrasound volume flow measurement and fluorescent microspheres. In addition, markers for metabolism and intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury were determined.\nECC with a roller pump induced a significant switch from the muscularis and mucosal layer of the small intestine, even with adequate macrocirculation (mucosal/muscular perfusion ratio: group I vs II, P = .005; group I vs III, P = .0018). Furthermore, the oxygen extraction ratio increased significantly in groups II (>30%) and III (>40%) in the beginning of the ECC compared with the control (group I vs II, P = .0037; group I vs III, P = .0062). Lactate concentrations and pH values did not differ between groups I and II; but group III demonstrated a significant shifting toward a lactate-associated acidosis (lactate: group I vs III, P = .0031; pH: group I vs III, P = .0001).\nWe demonstrated a significant shifting between the small intestinal gut wall layers induced by roller pump-driven ECC. The shift occurs independently of macrohemodynamics, with a significant effect on aerobic metabolism in the gut wall. Consequently, an optimal intestinal perfusion cannot be guaranteed by a roller pump; therefore, perfusion techniques need to be optimized.",

The SDF1-3'A polymorphism (G to A, rs1801157), located in the 3' untranslated region, could influence the expression of SDF1. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship of SDF1-3'A polymorphism with the risk of AAA occurrence and size.\nA total of 205 AAA patients and 216 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. The SDF1-3'A polymorphism was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction enzyme analysis.\nThe frequency of A allele was similar between groups. The genotype distribution also displayed no statistically significant differences under both the dominant model (odds ratio [OR], 0.922; P\u00a0= .678) and the recessive model (OR, 1.617; P\u00a0= .300). The multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the association between the polymorphism and AAA remained insignificant when applied to the dominant model. However, AAA patients with GG genotype were more likely to develop aneurysms larger than 50\u00a0mm (OR, 0.497; P\u00a0= .014). AAA patients with SDF1-3'A allele have reduced plasma SDF1\u03b1 levels. In addition, plasma SDF1\u03b1 levels were positively correlated with AAA size.\nOur study suggests that SDF1-3'A polymorphism is associated with size but not occurrence of AAA, providing further evidence that SDF1 is implicated in AAA progression.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies suggest that percutaneous access for endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (pEVAR) offers significant operative and postoperative benefits compared with femoral cutdown (cEVAR). National data on this topic, however, are limited. We compared patient selection and outcomes for elective pEVAR and cEVAR.\nWe identified all patients undergoing either pEVAR (bilateral percutaneous access, whether successful or not) or cEVAR (at least one planned groin cutdown) for abdominal aortic aneurysms from January 2011 to December 2013 in the Targeted Vascular data set from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Emergent cases, ruptures, cases with an iliac conduit, and cases with a preoperative wound infection were excluded. Groups were compared by \u03c7(2) test or t-test or the Mann-Whitney test where appropriate.\nWe identified 4112 patients undergoing elective EVAR, 3004 cEVAR patients (73%) and 1108 pEVAR patients (27%). Of all EVAR patients, 26% had bilateral percutaneous access; 1.0% had attempted percutaneous access converted to cutdown (4% of pEVARs); and the remainder had a planned cutdown, 63.9% bilateral and 9.1% unilateral. There were no significant differences in age, gender, aneurysm diameter, or prior open abdominal surgery. Patients undergoing cEVAR were less likely to have congestive heart failure (1.5% vs 2.4%; P = .04) but more likely to undergo any concomitant procedure during surgery (32% vs 26%; P < .01) than patients undergoing pEVAR. Postoperatively, pEVAR patients had shorter operative time (mean, 135 vs 152 minutes; P < .01), shorter length of stay (median, 1 day vs 2 days; P < .01), and fewer wound complications (2.1% vs 1.0%; P = .02). On multivariable analysis, the only predictor of percutaneous access failure was performance of any concomitant procedure (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.0; P = .04).\nCurrently, one in four patients treated at Targeted Vascular National Surgical Quality Improvement Program centers are getting pEVAR, which is associated with a high success rate, shorter operation time, shorter length of stay, and fewer wound complications compared with cEVAR.",

Of all EVAR patients, 26% had bilateral percutaneous access; 1.0% had attempted percutaneous access converted to cutdown (4% of pEVARs); and the remainder had a planned cutdown, 63.9% bilateral and 9.1% unilateral. There were no significant differences in age, gender, aneurysm diameter, or prior open abdominal surgery. Patients undergoing cEVAR were less likely to have congestive heart failure (1.5% vs 2.4%; P = .04) but more likely to undergo any concomitant procedure during surgery (32% vs 26%; P < .01) than patients undergoing pEVAR. Postoperatively, pEVAR patients had shorter operative time (mean, 135 vs 152 minutes; P < .01), shorter length of stay (median, 1 day vs 2 days; P < .01), and fewer wound complications (2.1% vs 1.0%; P = .02). On multivariable analysis, the only predictor of percutaneous access failure was performance of any concomitant procedure (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.0; P = .04).",

    "abstract": "Open repair (OPEN) and conservative management (CONS) have been the treatments of choice for splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) for many years. Endovascular repair (EV) has been increasingly used with good short-term results. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OPEN, EV, and CONS for the treatment of SAAs.\nA decision analysis model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2013 software (TreeAge Inc, Williamstown, Mass) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatments for SAAs. A hypothetical cohort of 10,000 55-year-old female patients with SAAs was assessed in the reference-case analysis. Perioperative mortality, disease-specific mortality rates, complications, rupture risks, and reinterventions were retrieved from a recent and extensive meta-analysis. Costs were analyzed with the 2014 Medicare database. The willingness to pay was set to $60,000/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Outcomes evaluated were QALYs, costs from the health care perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed and different clinical scenarios evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to include the uncertainty around the variables. A flowchart for clinical decision-making was developed.\nFor a 55-year-old female patient with a SAA, EV has the highest QALYs (11.32; 95% credibility interval [CI], 9.52-13.17), followed by OPEN (10.48; 95% CI, 8.75-12.25) and CONS (10.39; 95% CI, 8.96-11.87). The difference in effect for 55-year-old female patients between EV and OPEN is 0.84 QALY (95% CI, 0.42-1.34), comparable with 10 months in perfect health. EV is more effective and less costly than OPEN and more effective and more expensive compared with CONS, with an ICER of $17,154/QALY. Moreover, OPEN, with an ICER of $223,166/QALY, is not cost-effective compared with CONS. In elderly individuals (age >78 years), the ICER of EV vs CONS is $60,503/QALY and increases further with age, making EV no longer cost-effective. Very elderly patients (age >93 years) have higher QALYs and lower costs when treated with CONS. The EV group has the highest number of expected reinterventions, followed by CONS and OPEN, and the number of expected reinterventions decreases with age.\nEV is the most cost-effective treatment for most patient groups with SAAs, independent of the sex and risk profile of the patient. EV is superior to OPEN, being both cost-saving and more effective in all age groups. Elderly patients should be considered for CONS, based on the high costs in relation to the very small gain in health when treated with EV. The very elderly should be treated with CONS.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of fenestrated and multibranched endografting transformed the treatment paradigm of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). However, despite the minimally invasive character of the procedure, spinal cord ischemia (SCI) remains a devastating complication. The aim of this study was to address the SCI rates after endovascular TAAA repair and to analyze potential risk factors leading to this complication.\nA consecutive cohort of patients with nonruptured TAAAs treated by means of fenestrated and multibranched endografting between January 2010 and September 2014 was analyzed. Neurologic examination was routinely performed by an independent neurologist before operation and at discharge. The main outcome measure was the onset of SCI (paraplegia or paraparesis). Secondary outcomes were neurologic complications associated with cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) and 30-day mortality. Finally, a multivariate regression analysis identified risk factors for SCI.\nA consecutive 142 patients with TAAAs (Crawford type II, n = 54 [38%]; type III, n = 76 [54%]; type IV, n = 12 [8%]) were included in this study. The majority of patients (n = 129 [91%]) were treated for an atherosclerotic aneurysm, whereas 13 patients (9%) were treated for a postdissection aneurysm. The mean maximal aortic diameter was 65 \u00b1 13 mm. SCI developed in 23 patients (16%; paraplegia in 12 [8%] and paraparesis in 11 [8%]). Of these 23 patients, 10 patients (43%) showed the neurologic deficit directly after the procedure, 11 patients (48%) in the first 24 hours, and 2 patients (9%) after 24 hours. There was an improvement of the neurologic status in the majority of patients, with only three patients (2%) showing irreversible paraplegia at discharge. There was no difference in the 30-day mortality between patients with and without SCI (no SCI, n = 3 [3%] vs SCI, n = 1 [4%]; P = .511). Prophylactic use of CSFD before the procedure was performed in 64 patients (45%), and among them, 4 patients (6%) developed a CSFD-associated complication. No clinical benefit for patients receiving prophylactic placement of CSFD was found (P = .498). The multivariate analysis revealed the percentage of thoracic aortic coverage as the only significant risk factor for SCI (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.05; P = .001).\nThe SCI rate after endovascular repair of TAAA was 16%, with 8% of those patients suffering from paraplegia. Prophylactic use of CSFD could not reduce the SCI rate and was associated with 6% adverse events. The percentage of thoracic aortic coverage was the most powerful determinant of SCI in these series.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis access-induced distal ischemia (HAIDI) can be classified as acute (on the first postoperative day), subacute (\u22641 month), or chronic (>1 month), based on the time of onset after access creation. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. However, performing additional tests is beneficial in further assessment of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of finger pressure and oxygen saturation measurements for the diagnosis of chronic HAIDI.\nA total of 20 patients with chronic HAIDI (cases) and 40 asymptomatic hemodialysis patients (controls) were matched for age, sex, etiology of end-stage renal disease, and type of arteriovenous access. Basal digital pressure (BDP), digital pressure during manual compression of access, digital brachial index (DBI), change in digital pressure with access compression (CDP), digital pressure of the contralateral side, and bilateral oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) were measured in all patients.\nIn the case group, compression of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) increased mean BDP from 61 \u00b1 26 to 118 \u00b1 28 mm Hg (P < .001), which failed to reach the non-AVF side mean digital pressure of 151 \u00b1 25 mm Hg (P < .001). In addition, O2 Sat of the AVF side was significantly lower than the contralateral side (92.9% \u00b1 2.1% vs 95.6% \u00b1 1.4%; P = .001). Among the controls, manual AVF compression raised the mean BDP from 114 \u00b1 36 mm Hg to 133 \u00b1 29 mm Hg (P < .001), which was still significantly lower than the contralateral side mean digital pressure of 141 \u00b1 30 mm Hg (P = .002). In addition, O2 Sat values of the two sides were different (96.7% \u00b1 2.1% vs 97.1% \u00b1 1.9%; P = .01). Comparing the cases and controls, the mean BDP (61 \u00b1 26 mm Hg vs 114 \u00b1 36 mm Hg; P < .001), DBI (0.44 \u00b1 0.16 vs 0.82 \u00b1 0.19; P < .001), and O2 Sat (92.9% \u00b1 2.1% vs 96.7% \u00b1 2.1%; P < .001) were significantly lower and CDP (57 \u00b1 24 mm Hg vs 19 \u00b1 17 mm Hg; P < .001) was significantly higher in the cases than in the controls. The optimal discriminatory thresholds of 80 mm Hg for BDP, 0.7 for DBI, 40 mm Hg for CDP, and 94% for O2 Sat were determined.\nDigital pressure and O2 Sat measurements are useful additional methods to assist in the clinical evaluation of hemodialysis patients with access-related hand ischemia. BDP <80 mm Hg, DBI <0.7, CDP >40 mm Hg, and O2 Sat <94% are associated with chronic HAIDI.",

    "abstract": "One goal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is to reduce hospital readmissions, with financial penalties applied for excessive rates of unplanned readmissions within 30 days among Medicare beneficiaries. Recent data indicate that as many as 24% of Medicare patients require readmission after vascular surgery, although the rate of readmission after limited digital amputations has not been specifically examined. The present study was therefore undertaken to define the rate of unplanned readmission among patients after digital amputations and to identify the factors associated with these readmissions to allow the clinician to implement strategies to reduce readmission rates in the future.\nThe electronic medical and billing records of all patients undergoing minor amputations (defined as toe or transmetatarsal amputations using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes) from January 2000 through July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected for procedure- and hospital-related variables, level of amputation, length of stay, time to readmission, and level of reamputation. Patient demographics included hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular accident.\nMinor amputations were performed in 717 patients (62.2% male), including toe amputations in 565 (72.8%) and transmetatarsal amputations in 152 (19.5%). Readmission occurred in 100 patients (13.9%), including 28 (3.9%) within 30 days, 28 (3.9%) between 30 and 60 days, and 44 (6.1%) >60 days after the index amputation. Multivariable analysis revealed that elective admission (P < .001), peripheral arterial disease (P < .001), and chronic renal insufficiency (P = .001) were associated with readmission. The reasons for readmission were infection (49%), ischemia (29%), nonhealing wound (19%), and indeterminate (4%). Reamputation occurred in 95 (95%) of the readmitted patients, including limb amputation in 64 (64%) of the patients (below knee in 58, through knee in 2, and above knee in 4).\nReadmission after minor amputation was associated with limb amputation in the majority of cases. This study identified a number of nonmodifiable patient factors that are associated with an increased risk of readmission. Whereas efforts to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions are laudable, payers and regulators should consider these observations in defining unacceptable rates of readmission. Further, although beyond the scope of this study, it is not unreasonable to assume that pressure to reduce readmission rates in the population of patients with extensive comorbidity may induce practitioners to undertake amputation at a higher level initially to minimize the risk of readmission for reamputation and associated financial penalties and thus deprive the patient the chance for limb salvage.",

Readmission occurred in 100 patients (13.9%), including 28 (3.9%) within 30 days, 28 (3.9%) between 30 and 60 days, and 44 (6.1%) >60 days after the index amputation. Multivariable analysis revealed that elective admission (P < .001), peripheral arterial disease (P < .001), and chronic renal insufficiency (P = .001) were associated with readmission. The reasons for readmission were infection (49%), ischemia (29%), nonhealing wound (19%), and indeterminate (4%). Reamputation occurred in 95 (95%) of the readmitted patients, including limb amputation in 64 (64%) of the patients (below knee in 58, through knee in 2, and above knee in 4).",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for biomimetic self-assembling fluorosurfactant polymer (FSP) coatings incorporating heptamaltose (M7-FSP) to block nonspecific protein adsorption, the cell adhesive RGD peptide (RGD-FSP), or the endothelial cell-selective CRRETAWAC peptide (cRRE-FSP) to improve patency and endothelialization in small-diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular graft implants.\nePTFE vascular grafts (4\u00a0mm in diameter, 5\u00a0cm in length) were coated with M7-FSP, RGD-FSP, or cRRE-FSP by dissolving FSPs in distilled water and flowing solution through the graft lumen for 24\u00a0hours. Coatings were confirmed by receding water contact angle measurements on the lumen surface. RGD-FSP and cRRE-FSP grafts were presodded in\u00a0vitro with porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PPAECs) using a custom-designed flow system. PPAEC coverage on the lumen surface was visualized with epifluorescent microscopy and quantified. Grafts were implanted as carotid artery interposition bypass grafts in seven pigs for 33\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00a0days (ePTFE, n\u00a0= 3; M7-FSP, n\u00a0= 4; RGD-FSP, n\u00a0= 3; cRRE-FSP, n\u00a0= 4). Patency was confirmed immediately after implantation with duplex color flow ultrasound and at explantation with contrast-enhanced angiography. Grafts were sectioned for histology and stained: Movat pentachrome stain to outline vascular layers, immunofluorescent staining to identify endothelial cells (anti-von Willebrand factor antibody), and immunohistochemical staining to identify smooth muscle cells (anti-smooth muscle \u03b1-actin antibody). Neointima to lumen area ratio was determined to evaluate neointimal hyperplasia.\nReceding water contact angle measurements on graft luminal surfaces were significantly lower (P\u00a0< .05) on FSP-coated ePTFE surfaces (M7-FSP, 40\u00a0\u00b1 16 degrees; RGD-FSP, 25\u00a0\u00b1 10 degrees; cRRE-FSP, 33\u00a0\u00b1 16 degrees) compared with uncoated ePTFE (126\u00a0\u00b1 2 degrees), confirming presence of the FSP layer. In\u00a0vitro sodding of PPAECs on RGD-FSP and cRRE-FSP grafts resulted in a confluent monolayer of PPAECs on the luminal surface, with a similar cell population on RGD-FSP (1200\u00a0\u00b1 187 cells/mm(2)) and cRRE-FSP (1134\u00a0\u00b1 153 cells/mm(2)) grafts. All grafts were patent immediately after implantation, and one of three uncoated, two of three RGD-FSP, two of four M7-FSP, and two of four cRRE-FSP grafts remained patent after 1\u00a0month. PPAEC coverage of the lumen surface was seen in all patent grafts. RGD-FSP grafts had a slightly higher neointima to lumen area ratio (0.53\u00a0\u00b1 0.06) compared with uncoated (0.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15), M7-FSP (0.20\u00a0\u00b1 0.15), or cRRE-FSP (0.17\u00a0\u00b1 0.09) grafts.\nBiomimetic FSP-coated ePTFE grafts can be used successfully in\u00a0vivo and have potential to support endothelialization. Grafts modified with the M7-FSP and cRRE-FSP showed lower intimal hyperplasia compared with RGD-FSP grafts.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the incidence, the surgical details, and the outcome of late open conversion after failed endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nA review of English-language medical literature from 1991 to 2014 was conducted using the PubMed and EMBASE databases to find all studies involving late conversion after EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The search identified 26 articles encompassing 641 patients (84% men; median age, 73.5 years).\nMean interval from the initial implantation was 38.5 \u00b1 10.7 months. The cumulative single-center open conversion rate was 3.7%. The indications for late open conversion included endoleak in 62.4%, infection in 9.5%, migration in 5.5%, and thrombosis in 6.7%. Operations were urgent in 22.5% of the patients. The 30-day mortality was 9.1%. Mortality rates were different between elective (3.2%) and nonelective patients (29.2%). Five aneurysm-related deaths (1.5%) and two graft infections (0.6%) occurred during a median follow-up of 26.4 months (range, 5-50.2 months).\nThe number of patients with failed EVAR and without further options for endovascular salvage is growing. Endoleak remains the most important weakness of EVAR as the leading cause of late open conversion. Such procedures, although technically demanding, are associated with relatively low mortality rates when performed electively. Open repair still represents a valuable solution for many patients with failed EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Prompt carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in clinically significant carotid stenosis is important in the prevention of neurologic sequelae. The greatest benefit from surgery is obtained by prompt revascularization on diagnosis. It has been demonstrated that black patients both receive CEA less frequently than white patients do and experience worse postoperative outcomes. We sought to test our hypothesis that black race is an independent risk factor for a prolonged time from sonographic diagnosis of carotid stenosis warranting surgery to the day of operation (TDO).\nFrom 1998 to 2013 at a single institution, 166 CEA patients were retrospectively reviewed using Synthetic Derivative, a de-identified electronic medical record. Factors potentially affecting TDO, including demographics, preoperative cardiac stress testing, degree of stenosis, smoking status, and comorbidities, were noted. Multivariate analysis was performed on variables that trended with prolonged TDO on univariate analysis (P < .10) to determine independent (P < .05) predictors of TDO. Subgroup analyses were further performed on the symptomatic and asymptomatic stenosis cohorts.\nThere were 32 black patients and 134 white patients studied; the mean TDO was 78 \u00b1 17 days vs 33 \u00b1 3 days, respectively (P < .001). In addition to the need for preoperative cardiac stress testing, black race was the only variable that demonstrated a trend with (P < .10) or was an independent risk factor for (P < .05) prolonged TDO among all patients (B = 42 days; P < .001) and within the symptomatic (B = 35 days; P = .08) and asymptomatic (B = 35 days; P = .003) cohorts. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, black patients in each stratum of symptomatology (all, symptomatic, and asymptomatic patients) experienced prolonged TDO (log-rank, P < .03 for all three groups).\nBlack race is a risk factor for a temporal delay in CEA for carotid stenosis. Awareness of this disparity may help surgeons avoid undesirable delays in operation for their black patients.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound (DUS) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are both used as first-line noninvasive methods to investigate patients for internal carotid artery (ICA) disease. Although manual assessment of CTA is well established, semiautomated vessel analysis programs have yet to prove their clinical benefit. We compared one such vessel analysis program (TeraRecon, Foster City, Calif) with DUS.\nA total of 85 arteries in 50 patients (35 men, 15 women; mean age, 73 \u00b1 10 years) were eligible for comparison with the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. Duplex scanning comprised stenosis estimation based on (1) the intrastenotic and distal ICA diameter measurements on color-coded imaging (CCI), (2) the application of German Society for Ultrasound in Medicine (DEGUM) criteria (intrastenotic peak systolic velocity [PSV] \u2265 2 00 cm/s indicates 50% stenosis; intrastenotic PSV \u2265 300 cm/s together with a PSV of \u2265 50 cm/s in the distal ICA indicates 70% stenosis), and (3) the application of the University of Washington stenosis criteria (\u2265 50% stenosis is indicated by PSV >125 cm/s and end-diastolic velocity <140 cm/s; \u2265 80% stenosis is indicated by PSV >125 cm/s and end-diastolic velocity \u2265 140 cm/s). The minimum and maximum diameters at the stenosis site and at the distal reference ICA were automatically measured with the CTA vessel analysis tool. In addition, automated tracking generated corresponding cross-sectional areas at these two sites. Angiographic stenosis was then calculated using the minimum diameter (CTAmin), the average of the minimum and maximum diameters (CTAavg), and the areas (CTAarea) at both sites.\nCompared with duplex CCI, the three CTA modalities exhibited only a moderate agreement in terms of regression analysis (R(2) = 0.41-0.54) and Bland-Altman analysis (the standard deviation of the stenosis differences was >20%). In terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy, DEGUM stenosis graduation was best balanced by duplex CCI (50% stenosis: 100%, 93%, 85%, 100%, 95%; 70% stenosis: 71%, 100%, 100%, 97%, 98%) followed by CTAarea (50% stenosis: 80%, 73%, 54%, 90%, 75%; 70% stenosis: 66%, 94%, 55%, 96%, 96%). University of Washington stenosis was best balanced by duplex CCI followed by CTAarea.\nCTA analysis with a semiautomated vessel analysis tool provides variable results. Large discrepancies between methods in the degree of reported stenosis must be taken into consideration when CTA and DUS are used for clinical purposes. The semiautomated software tools need further improvements.",

    "abstract": "Recent interest has focused on the role of the methyl-arginines, endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide, as adverse prognostic indicators. To date, few studies have assessed the role of symmetric dimethyl-arginine (SDMA) in patients with peripheral arterial disease. We aimed to determine the relationship, if any, of SDMA to all-cause mortality and disease severity as assessed by the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nIn 238 patients with symptomatic PAD and an ABI of <0.8, l-arginine, asymmetric dimethyl-arginine (ADMA) and SDMA levels were measured by hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.\nThe median follow-up was 6 years 11 months (interquartile range [IQR], 4 years 5 months-7 years 10 months). SDMA and ADMA levels were higher in those who died compared with those who survived (0.51 [IQR, 0.44-0.66] \u03bcmol/L vs 0.46 [IQR, 0.39-0.55] \u03bcmol/L, P \u2264 .001; and 0.48 [IQR, 0.41-0.55] \u03bcmol/L vs 0.45 [IQR, 0.39-0.50] \u03bcmol/L, P = .007, respectively). l-arginine levels were similar in the two groups. On multivariate analysis, SDMA and ADMA as continuous variable were significantly associated with mortality (P = .001). For SDMA and ADMA, the highest compared with the lowest quartile levels were significantly associated with mortality (SDMA: hazard ratio, 3.855; 95% confidence interval, 1.625-9.143; P = .002; ADMA: hazard ratio, 2.277; 95% confidence interval, 1.114-4.654; P = .024). ADMA and SDMA showed a negative correlation with severity of PAD as assessed by ABI (r = -0.236, N = 216, P < .001; r = -0.209, N = 208, P = .002, respectively).\nThe novel finding of this study is that SDMA levels were predictive of all cause-mortality and correlated with disease severity. Further studies should assess the role of nitric oxide donors in patients with high levels of SDMA.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic grafts continue to be required for hemodialysis access when the options for native fistulas have been exhausted. The inferior long-term patency of grafts makes the possibility of preventing occlusion with heparin-bonded grafts an attractive alternative. We carried out a prospective randomized study to compare the patency of standard grafts with heparin-bonded grafts.\nPatients with end-stage renal failure requiring a prosthetic access were randomized to receive either a standard expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) graft or a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft. Patients were enrolled from June 2007 until November 2011 and were followed up until July 2013, when the study concluded.\nIn this study, 160 patients were randomized and followed up for a median of 23.5 months. No patient was lost to follow-up. Primary patency was 35% and 14% for heparin-bonded grafts and 29% and 12% for standard ePTFE grafts at 6 and 12 months, respectively (P = .48). Assisted primary patency was 54%, 41%, and 27% for heparin-bonded grafts and 41%, 30%, and 23% for standard grafts at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively (P = .12). Secondary patency was 83%, 83%, and 81% for heparin-bonded grafts and 81%, 73%, and 68% for standard grafts at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively (P = .33). There were significantly fewer thromboses in heparin-bonded grafts during the first 5 months (P = .020). Of 80 standard grafts, 24 were eventually abandoned vs 17 heparin-bonded grafts (P = .188). Bleeding complications, infections, and intervention rates were similar in both groups.\nHeparin-bonded grafts demonstrated a trend to improved patency, but the difference was not statistically significant. Heparin-bonded grafts had a significantly lower early thrombosis rate that was sustained only for the first 5 months of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Stent graft therapy has emerged as an alternative to open surgery in the management of chronic dissection-related aneurysmal degeneration (DRAD) in the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). The incidence of perioperative complications, need for secondary aortic intervention (SAI), and rate of aneurysmal false-lumen thrombosis have not been thoroughly described.\nPerioperative and midterm outcomes in patients who underwent stent graft therapy for chronic DRAD DTA at a single institution between January 2006 and September 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative anatomic factors, including the number of visceral and renal side branches off the false lumen, and false lumen volume, were analyzed for their ability to predict treatment failure. Treatment failure was defined as death, need for a SAI, and failure to achieve thrombosis of the DRAD DTA. Treatment success was defined as thrombosis of the false lumen in the area of the DRAD DTA with stability or a decrease in the maximum diameter of the DRAD DTA.\nDuring the study period, 47 patients underwent stent graft therapy for chronic DRAD DTA. Patients were a mean age of 58.3 \u00b1 11.7 years, 74.5% (n = 35) were male, and 14.9% (n = 7) had a history of connective tissue disease. The left subclavian artery was covered in 48.9% (n = 23), and revascularization was performed in 87.0% (n = 20). Spinal drains were used in 74.5% (n = 35). Spinal cord ischemia developed in 6.4% (n = 3), which resolved in two and improved in one. No retrograde aortic dissections occurred. The 30-day mortality was 4.3% (n = 2); one death was in a patient with rupture. Mean clinical follow-up was 35.1 \u00b1 20.9 months. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 89% \u00b1 5%. Treatment failure occurred in 18 patients (38.3%): 9 required SAIs, 6 did not have thrombosis of the false lumen in the area of the DRAD DTA, and 4 died, with 1 patient dying during a SAI. No preoperative anatomic factor predicted treatment failure. The 5-year freedom from treatment failure was 54% \u00b1 9%. Including the nine patients who underwent SAI, treatment success was achieved in 85.2% of patients.\nIn this single-center experience of stent graft therapy for chronic DRAD DTA, treatment success was achieved in 85% of patients after a SAI rate of 20%. No preoperative anatomic factor predicted treatment failure, which occurred in almost 40% of the patients. Identifying predictors of treatment failure may improve future outcomes.",

Data from prior randomized trials are limited and provide no health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes specific to CNI. Incidence of CNIs and their outcomes for patients in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST) were examined to identify factors predictive of CNI and their impact on HRQOL.\nIncidence of CNIs, baseline and procedural characteristics, outcomes, and HRQOL scores were evaluated in the 1151 patients randomized to CEA and undergoing surgery \u226430 days. Patients with CNI were identified and classified using case report forms, adverse event data, and clinical notes. Baseline and procedural characteristics were compared using descriptive statistics. Clinical outcomes at 1 and 12 months were analyzed. All data were adjudicated by two neurologists and a vascular surgeon. HRQOL was evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey to assess general health and Likert scales for disease-specific outcomes at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 months after CEA. The effect of CNI on SF-36 subscales was evaluated using random effects growth curve models, and Likert scale data were compared by ordinal logistic regression.\nCNI was identified in 53 patients (4.6%). Cranial nerves injured were VII (30.2%), XII (24.5%), and IX/X (41.5%), and 3.8% had Horner syndrome. CNI occurred in 52 of 1040 patients (5.0%) receiving general anesthesia and in one of 111 patients (0.9%) operated on under local anesthesia (P = .05). No other predictive baseline or procedural factors were identified. Deficits resolved in 18 patients (34%) at 1 month and in 42 of 52 patients (80.8%) by 1 year. One patient died before the 1-year follow-up visit. The HRQOL evaluation showed no statistical difference between groups with and without CNI at any interval. By Likert scale analysis, the group with CNI showed a significant difference in the difficulty eating/swallowing parameter at 2 and 4 weeks (P < .001) but not at 1 year.\nIn CREST, CNI occurred in 4.6% of patients undergoing CEA, with 34% resolution at 30 days and 80.8% at 1 year. The incidence of CNI was significantly higher in patients undergoing general anesthesia. CNI had a small and transient effect on HRQOL, negatively affecting only difficulty eating/swallowing at 2 and 4 weeks but not at 1 year. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that CNI is not a trivial consequence of CEA but rarely results in significant long-term disability.",

    "abstract": "The primary end points of this study were safety and efficacy of early cannulation of the Flixene graft (Maquet-Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH). Secondary end points were complications and patency.\nThis is a prospective single-center nonrandomized study. Study data included patient characteristics; history of vascular access; operative technique; interval between implantation and initial cannulation; complications; and patency at 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months. Patency rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nBetween January 2011 and September 2013, a total of 46 Flixene grafts were implanted in 44 patients (27 men) with a mean age of 63 years. The implantation site was the upper arm in 67% of cases, the forearm in 11%, and the thigh in 22%. Seven grafts were never cannulated during the study period. Of the remaining 39 grafts, 32 (82%) were successfully cannulated within the first week after implantation, including 16 (41%) on the first day. The median interval from implantation to initial cannulation was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-3 days). The median follow-up was 223.5 days (interquartile range, 97-600 days). Five hematomas occurred, but only one required surgical revision. Primary assisted and secondary patency rates were 65% and 86%, respectively, at 6 months and 56% and 86%, respectively, at 1 year.\nThis study suggests that cannulation of the Flixene graft within 1 week after implantation is safe and effective. Early cannulation avoids or shortens the need for a temporary catheter. One-year patency rates appeared to be comparable to those achieved with conventional grafts, but long-term follow-up and randomized controlled studies will be needed to confirm this finding.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are associated with improved long-term outcomes but longer maturation times and higher primary failure rates compared with arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). The Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative has recently emphasized tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) avoidance. We sought to characterize the relationship of AVFs and AVGs to the use of TDCs as well as secondary procedures.\nUsing the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) database, we identified incident hemodialysis (HD) patients in 2005 that started HD with a TDC and survived at least 1 year. We then monitored them through 2008. Access creation, TDC removal, TDC placement, and secondary procedures were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes (American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the primary end points.\nIn 2005, HD was initiated in 56,495 patients, 74% with a TDC. Of these, 6286 had an access procedure \u22643 months and 1 year of follow-up (AVF, 4634; AVG, 1652). Mean age was 67.7 years (AVF, 67.3; AVG, 68.7 years; P < .001), 53.3% were men (AVF, 58.1%; AVG, 40.5%; P < .001), and 33.8% were obese (AVF, 33.6%; AVG, 34.4%; P = not significant). AVG placement was associated with a higher TDC removal at 1 (7.9% vs 3.1%; P < .001), 3 (47.8% vs 17.8%; P < .001), and 6 (60.6% vs 47.2%; P < .001) months. There was no difference at 9 months (AVG, 64.9% vs AVF, 62.3%; P = .06). The median time to TDC removal was lower in the AVG group (70 days vs 155 days; P < .001). Multivariable model found AVFs were associated with decreased odds of TDC removal at 3 (odds ratio, 0.22; P < .001) and 6 months (odds ratio, 0.54; P < .001). AVGs required more secondary procedures than AVFs at all time points up to 1 year and specifically had increased thrombectomy procedures (39.8% vs 11.5%; P < .001).\nIn patients starting dialysis with a TDC, AVGs are associated with increased TDC removal and fewer catheter days compared with AVFs at up to 6 months. However, AVGs require more secondary procedures at all time points up to 1 year.",

    "abstract": "This study validated duplex ultrasound measurement of brachial artery volume flow (VF) as predictor of dialysis access flow maturation and successful hemodialysis.\nDuplex ultrasound was used to image upper extremity dialysis access anatomy and estimate access VF within 1 to 2 weeks of the procedure. Correlation of brachial artery VF with dialysis access conduit VF was performed using a standardized duplex testing protocol in 75 patients. The hemodynamic data were used to develop brachial artery flow velocity criteria (peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity) predictive of three VF categories: low (<600 mL/min), acceptable (600-800 mL/min), or high (>800 mL/min). Brachial artery VF was then measured in 148 patients after a primary (n = 86) or revised (n = 62) upper extremity dialysis access procedure, and the VF category correlated with access maturation or need for revision before hemodialysis usage. Access maturation was conferred when brachial artery VF was >600 mL/min and conduit imaging indicated successful cannulation based on anatomic criteria of conduit diameter >5 mm and skin depth <6 mm.\nMeasurements of VF from the brachial artery and access conduit demonstrated a high degree of correlation (R(2) = 0.805) for autogenous vein (n = 45; R(2) = 0.87) and bridge graft (n = 30; R(2) = 0.78) dialysis accesses. Access VF of >800 mL/min was predicted when the brachial artery lumen diameter was >4.5 mm, peak systolic velocity was >150 cm/s, and the diastolic-to-systolic velocity ratio was >0.4. Brachial artery velocity spectra indicating VF <800 mL/min was associated (P < .0001) with failure of access maturation. Revision was required in 15 of 21 (71%) accesses with a VF of <600 mL/min, 4 of 40 accesses (10%) with aVF of 600 to 800 mL/min, and 2 of 87 accesses (2.3%) with an initial VF of >800 mL/min. Duplex testing to estimate brachial artery VF and assess the conduit for ease of cannulation can be performed in 5 minutes during the initial postoperative vascular clinic evaluation.\nEstimation of brachial artery VF using the duplex ultrasound, termed the \"Fast, 5-min Dialysis Duplex Scan,\" facilitates patient evaluation after new or revised upper extremity dialysis access procedures. Brachial artery VF correlates with access VF measurements and has the advantage of being easier to perform and applicable for forearm and also arm dialysis access. When brachial artery velocity spectra criteria confirm a VF >800 mL/min, flow maturation and successful hemodialysis are predicted if anatomic criteria for conduit cannulation are also present.",

    "abstract": "Loss to follow-up (LTFU) can be a major difficulty for any clinical research study. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the extent of LTFU and its potential effect in studies of adult trauma patients with blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs).\nStudies comparing management of BTAIs were systematically reviewed. Duplicate independent review was used for study selection, data abstraction, and critical appraisals.\nThirty-six studies were included for synthesis, of which 94.1% applied a retrospective cohort design to prospective institutional databases. The mean LTFU at 1 year was 26.5% \u00b1 31.6% for endovascular repair and 20.6% \u00b1 34.2% for open repair groups. Not having a surgical/interventional specialist as a first or senior author was associated with a 39.7% higher LTFU at 1 year (P = .002). Studies with a higher risk of bias, later publication year, or North American origin were associated with a significantly higher risk for LTFU at 1 year (P \u2264 .001). Nearly half of included studies assessed in-hospital outcomes exclusively. Only 38.2% explicitly reported LTFU data. Eight studies explicitly described the method of dealing with LTFU: eight used survival analysis and one used a national Social Security Death Index. Sensitivity analyses using plausible worst-case LTFU scenarios resulted in 14% to 17% of studies changing direction of effect.\nThere is significant LTFU in trauma studies comparing operative methods for BTAIs. LTFU is generally handled and reported suboptimally, and sensitivity analyses suggest that study results are sensitive to differential LTFU. This has implications for the evidence-based choice of the operative method. Some protective factors that may aid in reducing LTFU were identified, one of which was involvement of a surgical or interventional specialist as a key author.",

Nearly half of included studies assessed in-hospital outcomes exclusively. Only 38.2% explicitly reported LTFU data. Eight studies explicitly described the method of dealing with LTFU: eight used survival analysis and one used a national Social Security Death Index. Sensitivity analyses using plausible worst-case LTFU scenarios resulted in 14% to 17% of studies changing direction of effect.",

    "abstract": "Although evidence has shown that ischemic heart disease (IHD) in vascular surgery patients has a negative impact on the prognosis after surgery, it is unclear whether directed treatment of IHD may influence cause-specific and overall mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic implication of coronary revascularization (CR) on overall and cause-specific mortality in vascular surgery patients.\nPatients undergoing surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid artery stenosis, or peripheral artery disease in a university hospital in The Netherlands between January 2003 and December 2011 were retrospectively included. Survival estimates were obtained by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis.\nA total of 1104 patients were included. Adjusted survival analyses showed that IHD significantly increased the risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.87) and cardiovascular death (HR, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.76). Compared with those without CR, patients previously undergoing CR had similar overall mortality (HR, 1.38 vs 1.62; P = .274) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.83 vs 2.02; P = .656). Nonrevascularized IHD patients were more likely to die of IHD (6.9% vs 35.7%), whereas revascularized IHD patients more frequently died of cardiovascular causes unrelated to IHD (39.1% vs 64.3%; P = .018).\nThis study confirms the significance of IHD for postoperative survival of vascular surgery patients. CR was associated with lower IHD-related death rates. However, it failed to provide an overall survival benefit because of an increased rate of cardiovascular mortality unrelated to IHD. Intensification of secondary prevention regimens may be required to prevent this shift toward non-IHD-related death and thereby improve life expectancy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of balloon angioplasty as the primary method of intervention in patients with color duplex ultrasound documented failing bypass grafts and to determine factors that may affect the patency of lower extremity bypass grafts revised by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).\nAll consecutive patients who underwent lower extremity bypass grafts from January 2009 to December 2013 were enrolled in a graft surveillance program. Patients identified as having failing grafts underwent arteriography to confirm the diagnosis with a view to concomitant treatment of the lesion using balloon angioplasty. Procedural success was defined as <30% residual stenosis. Treatment failure was defined as target lesion restenosis or graft occlusion. Descriptive and life-table analyses were performed.\nPTA was used to revise 96 failing grafts in 90 patients. Mean age was 65.8 years (range, 50-88 years), 64% were male, and 66% were symptomatic. Mean follow-up was 18.5 months (range, 3-24 months). Twenty-four grafts (25%) underwent repeat angioplasty for restenosis. Grafts with multiple lesions (P = .009) and grafts aged <6 months from the index operation (P = .004) were the only graft-related variables that showed a significant effect on the longevity of the endovascular revision. The PTA-revised grafts had primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of 56.9%, 83.2%, and 90%, respectively, at 2 years.\nPrimary balloon angioplasty of failing lower extremity bypass grafts, notwithstanding the higher restenosis rate and the need for reintervention, appears to be safe and is associated with acceptable early and medium-term patency rates.

In the current study, we investigated whether temporary silencing of eIF3e in muscles affects blood flow recovery in a mouse ischemic limb model.\neIF3e silencing was performed using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and changes in gene transcription and protein expression were analyzed in\u00a0vitro using murine primary skeletal muscle myoblast and human primary skeletal muscle myoblast cell cultures. In unilateral femoral artery ligation experiments, eIF3e siRNA-expressing plasmids were injected into the muscles of BALB/c mice near the ligation sites, and tissue damage and loss of limb function were scored for 28\u00a0days while serial measurements of limb perfusions were performed with laser Doppler perfusion imaging.\nSilencing of eIF3e in murine primary skeletal muscle myoblasts led to stabilization of HIF-2\u03b1 and upregulation of angiogenic transcripts, including basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor B (P\u00a0< .05), and the supernatant of eIF3e-silenced human primary skeletal muscle myoblasts triggered the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The in\u00a0vivo mouse model of hindlimb ischemia revealed that single intramuscular injections of eIF3e siRNA-expressing plasmids significantly enhanced perfusion of ischemia-damaged limbs (P\u00a0< .05) at days 7 and 14 and functional recovery at days 7, 14, and 21 (P\u00a0< .05).\neIF3e is an angiogenesis suppressor and may be a therapeutic target for promoting angiogenesis after ischemic injuries.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of popliteal artery injury (PAI) caused by blunt or penetrating mechanism is demanding. Concomitant injuries and prolonged ischemia are the major causes of lower extremity morbidity and poor rates of limb salvage. This study assessed the amputation rate and, subsequently, the therapeutic management and clinical outcomes regarding the affect of concomitant injuries among patients with PAI in a setting of central European trauma care.\nSixty-four patients (20 female and 44 male), with an average age of 44 years (range, 17-79 years) at the time of injury, were evaluated for clinical characteristics, concomitant injuries, complications, amputation rates, and functional outcome after traumatic PAI. The mechanism of injury was blunt trauma in 35 patients (54.7%) and penetrating trauma in 29 (45.3%). The Mangled Extremity Severity Score and the Injury Severity Score were assessed initially and the modified Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Score at 12 months after the primary surgery.\nThirty patients (47%) returned to their normal activity level within 1 year after trauma, and 16 (25%) were limited in their daily activity or suffered from chronic pain symptoms. Within the blunt trauma group 26 of 35 patients (74%) sustained severe concomitant injuries, whereas two of 29 patients (7%) in the penetrating group showed severe concomitant injuries (P < .046). Eleven patients (17%) had to undergo revision surgery due to their associated injuries. The median modified FIM score was 10.3, whereas patients with blunt trauma had significantly lower FIM score (P < .0082). The median Mangled Extremity Severity Score was 6 points (range, 6-16 points). Primary or secondary amputation was required in 18 patients (28%) due to failure of revascularization. Patients who sustained blunt trauma had significantly higher amputation rates than those with penetrating injuries (P < .035).\nClinical outcome and limb salvage of patients with PAI were influenced by the mechanism of trauma, concomitant injuries, prolonged ischemia time, and the type of surgical procedure. Patients after blunt trauma had a higher incidence of concomitant injuries, and (comminuted) fractures or knee dislocations and severe soft tissue damage had the highest effect on the amputation rate.",

    "abstract": "The eversion technique for carotid endarterectomy (eCEA) offers an alternative to longitudinal arteriotomy and patch closure (pCEA) for open carotid revascularization. In some reports, eCEA has been associated with a higher rate of >50% restenosis of the internal carotid when it is defined as peak systolic velocity (PSV) >125 cm/s by duplex imaging. Because the conformation of the carotid bifurcation may differ after eCEA compared with native carotid arteries, it was hypothesized that standard duplex criteria might not accurately reflect the presence of restenosis after eCEA.\nIn a case-control study, the outcomes of all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy by one surgeon during the last 10 years were analyzed retrospectively, with a primary end point of PSV >125 cm/s. Duplex flow velocities were compared with luminal diameter measurements for any carotid computed tomography arteriography or magnetic resonance angiography study obtained within 2 months of duplex imaging, with the degree of stenosis calculated by the methodology used in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) as well as cross-sectional area (CSA) reduction. Simulations were generated and analyzed by computational model simulations of the eCEA and pCEA arteries.\nEversion and longitudinal arteriotomy with patch techniques were used in 118 and 177 carotid arteries, respectively. Duplex follow-up was available in 90 eCEA arteries at a median of 16 (range, 2-136) months and in 150 pCEA arteries at a median of 41 (range, 3-115) months postoperatively. PSV >125 cm/s was present at some time during follow-up in 31% of eCEA and pCEA carotid arteries, each, and in the most recent duplex examination in 7% after eCEA and 21% after pCEA (P = .003), with no eCEA and two pCEA arteries occluding completely during follow-up (P = .29). In 19 carotid arteries with PSV >125 cm/s after angle correction (median, 160 cm/s; interquartile range, 146-432 cm/s) after eCEA that were subsequently examined by axial imaging, the mean percentage stenosis was 8% \u00b1 11% by NASCET, 11% \u00b1 5% by ECST, and 20% \u00b1 9% by CSA criteria. For eight pCEA arteries with PSV >125 cm/s (median velocity, 148 cm/s; interquartile range, 139-242 cm/s), the corresponding NASCET, ECST, and CSA stenoses were 8% \u00b1 35%, 26% \u00b1 32%, and 25% \u00b1 33%, respectively. NASCET internal carotid diameter reduction of at least 50% was noted by axial imaging after two of the eight pCEAs, and the PSV exceeded 200 cm/s in each case.\nThe presence of hemodynamically significant carotid artery restenosis may be overestimated by standard duplex criteria after eCEA and perhaps after pCEA. Insufficient information currently exists to determine what PSV does correspond to hemodynamically significant restenosis.",

PSV >125 cm/s was present at some time during follow-up in 31% of eCEA and pCEA carotid arteries, each, and in the most recent duplex examination in 7% after eCEA and 21% after pCEA (P = .003), with no eCEA and two pCEA arteries occluding completely during follow-up (P = .29). In 19 carotid arteries with PSV >125 cm/s after angle correction (median, 160 cm/s; interquartile range, 146-432 cm/s) after eCEA that were subsequently examined by axial imaging, the mean percentage stenosis was 8% \u00b1 11% by NASCET, 11% \u00b1 5% by ECST, and 20% \u00b1 9% by CSA criteria. For eight pCEA arteries with PSV >125 cm/s (median velocity, 148 cm/s; interquartile range, 139-242 cm/s), the corresponding NASCET, ECST, and CSA stenoses were 8% \u00b1 35%, 26% \u00b1 32%, and 25% \u00b1 33%, respectively. NASCET internal carotid diameter reduction of at least 50% was noted by axial imaging after two of the eight pCEAs, and the PSV exceeded 200 cm/s in each case.",

    "abstract": "Optimal diagnosis and management of median arcuate ligament (MAL) syndrome (MALS) remains unclear in contemporary practice. The advent and evolution of laparoscopic and endovascular techniques has redirected management toward a less invasive therapeutic algorithm. This study examined our contemporary outcomes of patients treated for MALS.\nAll patients treated for MALS at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center from 2000 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics and comorbidities were recorded. Freedom from symptoms and freedom from reintervention were the primary end points. Return to work or school was assessed. Follow-up by clinic visits and telephone allowed quantitative comparisons among the patients.\nDuring the study interval, 21 patients (24% male), with a median age of 42 years, were treated for MALS. All patients complained of abdominal pain in the presence of a celiac stenosis, 16 (76%) also reported weight loss at the time of presentation, and 57% had a concomitant psychiatric history. Diagnostic imaging most commonly used included duplex ultrasound (81%), computed tomography angiography (66%), angiography (57%), and magnetic resonance angiography (5%). Fourteen patients (67%) underwent multiple diagnostic studies. All patients underwent initial laparoscopic MAL release. Seven patients (33%) underwent subsequent celiac stent placement in the setting of recurrent or unresolved symptoms with persistent celiac stenosis at a mean interval of 49 days. Two patients required surgical bypass after an endovascular intervention failed. The 6-month freedom from symptoms was 75% and freedom from reintervention was 64%. Eighteen patients (81%) reported early symptom improvement and weight gain, and 66% were able to return to work.\nA multidisciplinary treatment approach using initial laparoscopic release and subsequent stent placement and bypass surgery provides symptom improvement in most patients treated for MALS. The potential placebo effect, however, remains uncertain. A significant minority of patients will require reintervention, justifying longitudinal surveillance and prudent patient selection. Patients can anticipate functional recovery, weight gain, and return to work with treatment.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported that endovascular repair (EVAR) of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) has lower postoperative mortality than open repair (OR). However, comparisons involved heterogeneous populations that lacked adjustment for preoperative risk. We hypothesize that for RAAA patients stratified by a validated measure of preoperative mortality risk, EVAR has a lower in-hospital mortality and morbidity than does OR.\nIn-hospital mortality and morbidity after EVAR and OR of RAAA were compared in patients from the Vascular Quality Initiative (2003-2013) stratified by the validated Vascular Study Group of New England RAAA risk score into low-risk (score 0-1), medium-risk (score 2-3), and high-risk (score 4-6) groups.\nAmong 514 patients who underwent EVAR and 651 patients who underwent OR of RAAA, EVAR had lower in-hospital mortality (25% vs 33%, P = .001). In risk-stratified patients, EVAR trended toward a lower mortality in the low-risk group (n = 626; EVAR, 10% vs OR, 15%; P = .07), had a significantly lower mortality in the medium-risk group (n = 457; EVAR, 37% vs OR, 48%; P = .02), and no advantage in the high-risk group (n = 82; EVAR, 95% vs OR, 79%; P = .17). Across all risk groups, cardiac complications (EVAR, 29% vs OR, 38%; P = .001), respiratory complications (EVAR, 28% vs OR, 46%; P < .0001), renal insufficiency (EVAR, 24% vs OR, 38%; P < .0001), lower extremity ischemia (EVAR, 2.7% vs OR, 8.1%; P < .0001), and bowel ischemia (EVAR, 3.9% vs OR, 10%; P < .0001) were significantly lower after EVAR than after OR. Across all risk groups, median (interquartile range) intensive care unit length of stay (EVAR, 2 [1-5] days vs OR, 6 [3-13] days; P < .0001) and hospital length of stay (EVAR, 6 [4-12] days vs OR, 13 [8-22] days; P < .0001) were lower after EVAR.\nThis novel risk-stratified comparison using a national clinical database showed that EVAR of RAAA has a lower mortality and morbidity compared with OR in low-risk and medium-risk patients and that EVAR should be used to treat these patients when anatomically feasible. For RAAA patients at the highest preoperative risk, there is no benefit to using EVAR compared with OR.",

    "abstract": "The Supera stent (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill) has a unique biomimetic design allowing axial and longitudinal flexibility and fracture resistance. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the midterm patency of Supera stents used to treat patients with superficial femoral and popliteal arterial disease by a single practice.\nFrom April 2010 to December 2011, 53 patients and 59 limbs with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions underwent angioplasty and stenting with the Supera stent. Five patients had no follow-up and were excluded. Demographics of the patients, radiographic images, morphologic features of the lesions, procedural reports, reinterventions, and follow-up clinical visit notes were reviewed. Primary patency was defined as clinical resolution of symptoms with no secondary interventions. Primary and secondary patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nA total of 48 patients (42 men, six women; 54 limbs; mean age, 64.3 years [range, 51-87]) received Supera stents and had at least one follow-up visit as part of their treatment for femoropopliteal disease. Primary indications for intervention included claudication, rest pain, and tissue loss, at rates of 54% (29 of 54), 26% (14 of 54), and 20% (11 of 54), respectively; 22% of lesions were TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus type A or B and 78% were type C or D. Mean lesion length was 24.0 cm (range, 3-51). Mean follow-up was 27.5 months (range, 1-45). The ankle-brachial index increased from 0.58 \u00b1 0.20 preoperatively to 0.77 \u00b1 0.18 postoperatively (P = .00004). Primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates at latest follow-up were 79.6%, 88.9%, and 92.3%, respectively. Cumulative primary patency rates by Kaplan-Meier analysis at 12, 24, and 36 months were 85.6%, 83.1%, and 76.7%, respectively. Secondary patency rates by Kaplan-Meier estimates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 93.8%, 93.8%, and 89.3%, respectively. No stent fractures were found at the time of any reinterventions. Long lesions >30 cm (n = 18) showed equivalent patency to lesions of 1 to 15 cm (n = 18) and lesions 15 to 30 cm in length (n = 18).\nOur midterm results show that Supera stents are durable in treating femoropopliteal lesions, with notably high patency rates in patients with long lesion lengths.",

    "abstract": "The treatment outcomes of ruptured visceral artery aneurysms (rVAAs) have been sparsely characterized, with no clear comparison between different treatment modalities. The purpose of this paper was to review the perioperative and long-term outcomes of open and endovascular interventions for intact visceral artery aneurysms (iVAAs) and rVAAs.\nThis was a retrospective review of all treated VAAs at one institution from 2003 to 2013. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, management, and subsequent outcomes (technical success, mortality, reintervention) and complications were recorded.\nThe study identified 261 patients; 181 patients were repaired (77 ruptured, 104 intact). Pseudoaneurysms were more common in rVAAs (81.8% vs 35.3% for iVAAs; P < .001). The rVAAs were smaller than the iVAAs (20.7 mm vs 27.5 mm; P = .018), and their most common presentation was abdominal pain; 29.7% were hemodynamically unstable. Endovascular intervention was the initial treatment modality for 67.4% (75.3% for rVAAs, 61.5% for iVAAs). The perioperative complication rate was higher for rVAAs (13.7% vs 1% for iVAAs; P = .003), as was mortality at 30 days (13% vs 0% for iVAAs; P = .001), 1 year (32.5% for rVAAs vs 4.1% for iVAAs; P < .001), and 3 years (36.4% for rVAAs vs 8.3% for iVAAs; P < .001). Lower 30-day mortality was noted with endovascular repair for rVAAs (7.4% vs 28.6% open; P = .025). Predictors of mortality for rVAAs included age (odds ratio, 1.04; P = .002), whereas endovascular repair was protective (odds ratio, 0.43; P = .037). Mean follow-up was 26.2 months, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were higher for iVAAs at 3 years (88% vs 62% for rVAAs; P = .045). The 30-day reintervention rate was higher for rVAAs (7.7% vs 19.5% for iVAAs; P = .019) but was similar between open and endovascular repair (8.2% vs 15%; P = NS).\nrVAAs have significant mortality. Open and endovascular interventions are equally durable for elective repair of VAAs, but endovascular interventions for rVAAs result in lower morbidity and mortality.

The rVAAs were smaller than the iVAAs (20.7 mm vs 27.5 mm; P = .018), and their most common presentation was abdominal pain; 29.7% were hemodynamically unstable. Endovascular intervention was the initial treatment modality for 67.4% (75.3% for rVAAs, 61.5% for iVAAs). The perioperative complication rate was higher for rVAAs (13.7% vs 1% for iVAAs; P = .003), as was mortality at 30 days (13% vs 0% for iVAAs; P = .001), 1 year (32.5% for rVAAs vs 4.1% for iVAAs; P < .001), and 3 years (36.4% for rVAAs vs 8.3% for iVAAs; P < .001). Lower 30-day mortality was noted with endovascular repair for rVAAs (7.4% vs 28.6% open; P = .025). Predictors of mortality for rVAAs included age (odds ratio, 1.04; P = .002), whereas endovascular repair was protective (odds ratio, 0.43; P = .037). Mean follow-up was 26.2 months, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were higher for iVAAs at 3 years (88% vs 62% for rVAAs; P = .045). The 30-day reintervention rate was higher for rVAAs (7.7% vs 19.5% for iVAAs; P = .019) but was similar between open and endovascular repair (8.2% vs 15%; P = NS).",

    "abstract": "Aortic diameter as the primary criterion in the decision to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has drawbacks as some rupture below size thresholds, whereas others reach extreme size without rupture. Predictions of static aortic wall stress have also failed to reliably predict rupture potential. The objective of this study was to computationally assess blood flow characteristics at the site of infrarenal AAA rupture. On the basis of the finite element literature correlating rupture location with high static local wall stress, we hypothesized that a computational fluid dynamics approach would also demonstrate rupture at regions of high pressure and wall shear stress (WSS).\nThree-dimensional AAA geometry was generated from computed tomography angiography images of seven ruptured AAAs. Aortic blood flow velocity, pressure, and WSS were computationally determined. Flow characteristics at the site of rupture were determined and compared across all cases.\nAAA size at the time of rupture was 8.3\u00a0\u00b1 0.9\u00a0cm. Only three of the seven AAAs ruptured at the site of maximal diameter. Blood flow velocity in the aneurysmal aorta showed dominant flow channels with zones of recirculation, where low WSS predominated. Regardless of aneurysm size or configuration, rupture occurred in or near these flow recirculation zones in all cases. WSS was significantly lower and thrombus deposition was more abundant at the site of rupture.\nThis computational study was the first to assess blood flow characteristics at the site of infrarenal AAA rupture in realistic aortic geometries. In contradiction to our initial hypothesis, rupture occurred not at sites of high pressure and WSS but rather at regions of predicted flow recirculation, where low WSS and thrombus deposition predominated. These findings raise the possibility that this flow pattern may lead to thrombus deposition, which may elaborate adventitial degeneration and eventual AAA rupture.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of and specific preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in electively treated vascular surgery patients.\nBetween March 2010 and November 2013, all vascular surgery patients were included in a prospective database. Various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors were collected during hospitalization. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of POD. Secondary outcome variables were any surgical complication, hospital length of stay, and mortality.\nIn total, 566 patients were prospectively evaluated; 463 patients were 60 years or older at the time of surgery and formed our study cohort. The median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 66-77), and 76.9% were male. Twenty-two patients (4.8%) developed POD. Factors that differed significantly by univariate analysis included current smoking (P = .001), increased comorbidity (P = .001), hypertension (P = .003), diabetes mellitus (P = .001), cognitive impairment (P < .001), open aortic surgery or amputation surgery (P < .001), elevated C-reactive protein level (P < .001), and blood loss (P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR], 16.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-57.0), open aortic surgery or amputation surgery (OR, 14.0; 95% CI, 3.9-49.8), current smoking (OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 2.8-40.2), hypertension (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 1.9-30.5) and age \u226580 years (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.8-30.1) to be independent predictors of the occurrence of POD. The combination of these parameters allows us to predict delirium with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 92%. The area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating characteristics was 0.93. Delirium was associated with longer hospital length of stay (P < .001), more frequent and increased intensive care unit stays (P = .008 and P = .003, respectively), more surgical complications (P < .001), more postdischarge institutionalization (P < .001), and higher 1-year mortality rates (P = .0026).\nIn vascular surgery patients, preoperative cognitive impairment and open aortic or amputation surgery were highly significant risk factors for the occurrence of POD. In addition, POD was significantly associated with a higher mortality and more institutionalization. Patients with these risk factors should be considered for high-standard delirium care to improve these outcomes.",

PAD can be detected through a noninvasive measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI).\nWe conducted a systematic review of several electronic bibliographic databases for studies that evaluated ABI as a screening test for PAD in asymptomatic individuals. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis, reporting pooled hazard ratios (HRs) when appropriate.\nWe included 40 individual studies, 2 systematic reviews, and 1 individual-patient data meta-analysis. We found no studies comparing ABI screening with no screening in terms of patient-important outcomes (mortality, amputations). The yield of PAD screening averaged 17% (range, 1%-42%) and was 1% to 4% in lower risk populations. Patients with PAD had higher adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.16-4.12) and of cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-2.89). Data on benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening were limited; however, ABI screening was associated with additional prognostic information and risk stratification for heart disease. The overall quality of evidence supporting screening was low.\nThe current available evidence demonstrates that PAD is common in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but it does not support the benefit of routine ABI screening.",

    "abstract": "Basilic vein transposition is recommended in patients who are not candidates for a radial or brachial artery to cephalic vein fistula for dialysis access. Both one-stage and two-stage procedures have their advantages and disadvantages. Which procedure results in improved outcomes remains unclear.\nA systematic review was conducted of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies that compared one-stage and two-stage brachial-basilic vein transpositions. Abstracts and full-text studies were screened independently by two reviewers with data abstraction done in duplicate. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to identify differences in primary failure rates and 1-year primary and secondary patency rates. Study quality was assessed by a previously described tool designed for observational studies reporting on dialysis access outcomes.\nOf 1662 abstracts screened, 97 were selected for full-text review. Of these, eight studies (one randomized trial, seven observational studies) involving 882 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratio estimate for primary failure was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.98; P = .46), suggesting no difference in failure rate between one-stage and two-stage transpositions. Similarly, the estimated odds ratio for 1-year primary patency rate of 1.39 (95% CI, 0.71-2.72; P = .33) and 1-year secondary patency rate of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.36-2.87; P = .98) indicated no difference between the two groups. Study quality was limited by unclear outcome definitions, minimal control for confounding, and variable selection criteria. The decision to pursue a one-stage vs a two-stage procedure was often based on size of the basilic vein, with a two-stage procedure reserved for patients with smaller veins.\nMeta-analysis of the existing literature comparing one-stage and two-stage basilic vein transposition suggests no difference in failure and patency rates, despite the two-stage procedure's being used in patients with smaller basilic veins. These findings are limited by the small size, observational design, and inconsistent quality of included studies. Reserving a two-stage procedure for patients with smaller basilic veins appears justified, although the strength of the evidence is limited.",

    "abstract": "Guidelines recommend placing native arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) as far distally in the upper extremity as possible. If there are adequate veins and adequate arteries, a wrist fistula, which offers notably lower risks than grafts and catheters, would be the first choice for long-term hemodialysis. With increasing failure and difficulty to create wrist fistulas, we reviewed outcomes of the proximal radial AVF (PRAAVF) and demonstrate that it is an effective technique.\nA systemic literature research was conducted in PubMed and related bibliographies. The focus of data extraction was primary failure, primary patency rates, and secondary patency rates after 1 and 2 years. Estimates were pooled with the random effects model, and meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were performed to explore heterogeneity.\nAccording to selection criteria formulated a priori, 10 articles (n = 1310) were included and finally analyzed after screening 1687 articles. The pooled primary failure was 12.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.6%-17.0%; \u03c7(2) = 70.8, I(2) = 87.3%), the primary patency, including primary failure, was 73.6% (95% CI, 52.4%-94.9%; \u03c7(2) = 71.3, I(2) = 97.2%) at 1 year and 70.5% (95% CI, 50.6%-90.5%; \u03c7(2) = 58.8, I(2) = 96.6%) at 2 years. Secondary patency was 80.0% (95% CI, 72.8%-87.2%; \u03c7(2) = 24.42, I(2) = 75.4%) at 1 year and 73.7% (95% CI, 65.2%-82.2%; \u03c7(2) = 28.51, I(2) = 79.0%) at 2 years. Individual variate meta-regression analysis found the definition of primary failure was a significant source of heterogeneity (P = .009). Steal syndromes developed in four of 832 (0.5%) of the PRAAVFs, and venous hypertension developed in four of 284 (1.4%).\nThe PRAAVF presented low to moderate primary failure and high primary and secondary patency rates with acceptable complications. Consideration of the specific fistula is required when creating a vascular access, especially when a wrist fistula has failed or is predicted to be unsuccessful.",

    "abstract": "This randomized clinical trial compared endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and surgical ligation with attempted stripping in the treatment of small saphenous vein (SSV) insufficiency. The early results demonstrated that EVLA was more likely to eradicate axial reflux and was also associated with a faster recovery, lower periprocedural pain, and fewer sensory complications. The aim of this 2-year follow-up was to establish whether these benefits remained stable over time and whether these improved technical outcomes were associated with less clinical recurrence.\nPatients with primary saphenopopliteal junction and SSV reflux were randomized to EVLA or saphenopopliteal junction ligation and attempted stripping/excision. Outcomes assessed at 2 years included the presence of residual or recurrent reflux, clinical recurrence, sensory complications, the need for secondary intervention, and patient-reported quality of life on the Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire, SF-36, and EuroQol.\nOf 106 patients who were equally randomized and successfully treated according to the protocol, 88 (83%) were successfully assessed at 2 years. The groups were comparable at baseline. At 2 years, EVLA remained superior to surgery in eradicating axial reflux in 36 patients (81.2%) compared with 29 (65.9%) in the surgery group (P = .002). There was no significant difference in clinical recurrence (EVLA: seven of 44 [16%] vs surgery: 10 of 44 [23%]; P = .736), sensory disturbance (EVLA: one [2.4%] vs surgery vs three [6.8%]; P = 1.000) or any quality of life domain.\nThe results of treatment of SSV insufficiency with EVLA appear durable up until 2 years. The study does not appear to suggest that the improved abolition of reflux after EVLA compared with surgery is associated with superior outcomes than those seen after surgery by this time point, because equal effect was shown in both groups. The sensory disturbance associated with surgery appears to settle over this time frame. EVLA is therefore superior in the short-term and not inferior by 2 years.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in endovascular therapy for lower extremity arterial disease, open surgical revascularization is still required when the disease is extensive. Although autogenous vein is the conduit of choice for open femoropopliteal bypass, prosthetic grafts can be an acceptable alternative when adequate vein is not available. The FUSION BIOLINE heparin-coated vascular graft (Maquet Endovascular, Wayne, NJ) was developed to improve the patency rate associated with standard prosthetic grafts. The current study, the FINEST Trial (Comparison of Safety and Primary Patency Between the FUSION BIOLINE Heparin-Coated Vascular Graft and EXXCEL Soft ePTFE), was designed to assess the clinical outcome of heparin-coated and standard vascular grafts in a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial.\nDuring a 25-month period ending in June 2012, 209 eligible patients scheduled to undergo elective prosthetic femoral to above-knee or below-knee popliteal bypass were randomized to receive a standard expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft or the heparin-coated FUSION BIOLINE vascular graft. Among 203 patients in the efficacy analysis, claudication was the presenting symptom in 147 (72.4%), and the site of the distal anastomosis was at the above-knee level in 174 (85.7%). Grafts were assessed by duplex ultrasound imaging and ankle-brachial indices performed postoperatively at discharge and at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency of the study graft. The primary safety end point was the composite of major adverse events and periprocedural death. Secondary end points included the time to hemostasis of bleeding at the anastomotic suture hole and primary assisted and secondary patency.\nThe primary patency rates at 6 months were 86.4% for the FUSION BIOLINE heparin-coated vascular graft group compared with 70.0% for the standard ePTFE group, a difference of 16.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.7%-29.9%; P = .006), and the respective rates at 12 months were 76.5% and 67.0% (95% confidence interval, -4.8% to 23.0%; P = .05). The mean time to hemostasis of bleeding at the suture hole was 3.5 minutes in the FUSION BIOLINE group and 11.0 minutes in the standard ePTFE group (P < .0001). Major adverse events were significantly lower in the FUSION BIOLINE group, occurring in 17.1%, compared with 30.7% in the standard ePTFE group (P = .033), principally a result of a lower rate of major graft reinterventions through 12 months in the FUSION BIOLINE group (16.2% vs 30.7%).\nData from this randomized multicenter study demonstrated improved midterm patency, less bleeding at the suture hole, and lower major adverse events with the FUSION BIOLINE heparin-coated vascular graft compared with standard ePTFE grafts. Although the ultimate long-term benefit of the graft cannot be ascertained with the data currently available, the utility of the FUSION BIOLINE vascular graft appears promising.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience of total laparoscopic aortic bypass surgery performed for aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD), focusing on early 30-day mortality and morbidity and short-term and midterm outcomes.\nA monocentric retrospective study was conducted between October 2002 and October 2011; we performed 173 total laparoscopic aortic surgeries to treat AIOD.\nPatients included 135 men and 38 women. The mean age was 57.2 years (range, 34-77 years). The median operative time was 205 minutes (range, 120-420 minutes), the median aortic clamping time was 50 minutes (range, 20-120 minutes), and the mean blood loss was 263 mL (range, 0-3200 mL). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 12.1% of patients. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 2.3% (four of 173 patients). Major morbidity occurred in 6.9% of patients. Wound complications occurred in 8%. Four patients had a groin infection (2.3%), treated by surgical trimming in three patients and replacement of the prosthesis by venous bypass in one patient. Early graft thrombosis (within 30 days) occurred in one patient (0.6%), requiring reintervention. With a mean follow-up of 42 months (standard deviation, 37 months), 96% of bypasses were patent. Patency rates at 3 and 5 years were 97% and 85% respectively.\nIn selected patients, laparoscopic aortic bypass surgery for AIOD is a safe procedure with an acceptable morbidity rate, short intensive care unit and hospital stay, fast recovery, and early return to general diet. It is a good indication after failure of endovascular surgery.",

This study reports outcomes of carotid revascularization in asymptomatic dialysis patients in the United States.\nUsing United States Renal Data System (USRDS) databases, we identified all dialysis patients who underwent CEA or CAS for asymptomatic disease from 2005 to 2008. CEA and CAS were identified by Current Procedural Terminology (American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) codes, and symptom status and comorbidities by International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcomes were stroke, cardiac complications, and death at 30 days and at 1 and 3 years. Predictors of death were identified using multivariate regression models.\nOf 738,561 dialysis patients, 2131 asymptomatic patients underwent carotid revascularization (1805 CEA, 326 CAS). The mortality rate was 4.7% at 30 days (4.6% CEA, 4.9% CAS; P = .807). Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were 75.1% at 1 year (75.9% CEA, 70.7% CAS) and 43.4% at 3 years (43.7% CEA, 41.6% CAS). The stroke rate was 6.5% at 30 days (6.4% CEA, 6.9% CAS; P = .774) and 13.6% at 1 year (13.3% CEA, 15.0% CAS; P = .490). Cardiac complications occurred in 22.0% of patients (3.3% myocardial infarction) at 30 days (22.2% CEA, 20.6% CAS; P = .525).

Age >70 years at the time of surgery and increased time on dialysis were predictive of death, whereas a history of renal transplant was a protective factor.\nPatients on dialysis have high perioperative and long-term stroke or death rates after CEA or CAS for asymptomatic stenosis, with a median survival that is less than recommended by current guidelines. As a result, carotid intervention in these patients appears to be inappropriate.",

Age >70 years at the time of surgery and increased time on dialysis were predictive of death, whereas a history of renal transplant was a protective factor.",

    "abstract": "Mortality from abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in developed countries has decreased since the late 1990s. Our objective was to get an insight of mortality trends in The Netherlands for AAA disease.\nData of all AAA deaths (1980 to 2010) were collected from the Dutch cause of death register. Cause of death was divided in two groups: with the mention of rupture and without the mention of rupture. Data were standardized and divided into three age groups (55-69, 70-84, and \u226585 years). Mortality rates per 100,000 were analyzed for both sexes and for each age group. Significant points of change were identified using joinpoint regression analysis.\nTotal standardized AAA mortality increased from 1980 (1062 deaths) until 1995 (1728 deaths), followed by a decline until 2010 (930 deaths). This decline was most prominent in men. Deaths without mention of rupture showed an increase from 1980 until 2010. The age of AAA death was higher in women (79.2 in 1980 and 82.1 in 2010) than in men. This difference declined as the age of death from AAA increased from 72.1 in 1980 to 77.9 years in 2010 in men. Decline in AAA mortality was first seen in the young age group (55-69 years) and then seen consecutively older age groups.\nMortality from AAA is declining due to a reduction in deaths from ruptured AAAs. This was first observed in the young age groups. Men died more often and at a lower age.",

    "abstract": "Acute renal failure (ARF) is reported in up to 12% of patients after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair with assisted circulation. ARF increases mortality, reduces quality of life, and increases length of hospital stay. This study analyzes ARF after TAAA repair done without assisted circulation.\nA retrospective analysis of all patients treated for TAAA from 2000 to 2013 was performed using a concurrently maintained, institutionally approved database. All surgeries used simple cross-clamp technique, with moderate systemic hypothermia (32\u00b0-33\u00b0C) and renal artery perfusion with 4\u00b0C solution. Serum creatinine concentration was measured preoperatively and 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days after surgery, and Cockcroft-Gault estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. Kidney injury was classified by RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, End-stage renal disease) eGFR criteria. Changes in eGFR, kidney injury, ARF, dialysis, length of stay, mortality, and risk factors for ARF were analyzed with SAS-JMP software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for univariate analysis and multivariate modeling.\nFrom 2000 to 2013, 455 patients had TAAA surgery; 116 (25.5%) were acute. Mean preoperative eGFR was 62.3 mL/min. Mean renal ischemia time was 58.9 minutes. Eighteen patients (4%) had ARF; nine (2%) required temporary dialysis, and three (0.66%) required permanent dialysis. In univariate analysis, age, renal ischemia time, acuity, baseline eGFR, previous aortic surgery, surgical blood loss, and return to operating room for bleeding complications were significant for ARF (P < .05). Sex, aneurysm extent by Crawford type, cardiac index and mean arterial pressure after reperfusion, and use of loop diuretics were not significant for ARF. In a stepwise deletion model, acute (P = .0377), previous aortic surgery (P = .0167), return to operating room (P = .0213), and age (P = .0478) were significant for ARF. Surgical blood loss (P = .0056) and return to operating room (P = .0024) were significant for postoperative dialysis in multivariate analysis. Only surgical blood loss was significant for permanent dialysis in a multivariate model (P = .0331).\nVery low ARF after TAAA repair can be achieved by simple cross-clamp technique with moderate systemic hypothermia and profound renal cooling. Age, preoperative eGFR, previous aortic surgery, return to operating room, and surgical blood loss were significant for ARF. Return to operating room for bleeding and surgical blood loss were significant for dialysis. Baseline eGFR <30 mL/min and postoperative dialysis were significant for mortality. Most patients with ARF, even those with temporary dialysis after TAAA repair, recover renal function to near preoperative levels.",

    "abstract": "As thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are more frequently being treated with endografts, the anatomic challenges of the thoracic aorta have led to design modifications of endografts. The Conformable GORE TAG (CTAG) device (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) was specifically designed to be more conformable in tortuous anatomy, more resistant to compression, and more accommodating to various aortic diameters compared with the original GORE TAG device. This prospective, multicenter study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the CTAG endograft in the repair of descending TAA.\nThis was a prospective, multicenter regulatory study with a primary end point of freedom from major device event through 1 month after treatment. Two-year outcomes included aneurysm-related morbidity (endoleaks and morphology changes), aneurysm-related mortality, and all-cause mortality.\nFifty-one patients were enrolled between October 2009 and October 2010, with at least one endograft implanted in 50 patients. After the regulatory study successfully completed its primary end point and expanded to a continued-access phase, 15 additional patients were enrolled in the continued-access arm of the study from February 2011 until September 2011, for a total treatment group of 66 patients for the early results and 65 patients for the long-term clinical results with imaging evaluation. There was one 30-day death (1.5%), two patients (3%) with spinal cord ischemia, and two central strokes (3%) \u226430 days. Five patients (7.6%) died \u22641 year; 1 of ascending aortic aneurysm rupture, 2 of cardiac disease, and 2 of respiratory failure. The core laboratory adjudicated 1-month imaging in 60 patients (92.3%), where nine endoleaks (15.0%) were identified (1 type Ia, 4 type II, and 4 indeterminate). Forty-five patients (69.2%) had 2-year imaging with five endoleaks (11.1%; two type II and three indeterminate), and one patient had a distal aortic dilatation that required a secondary intervention. At 2 years, 20 of 38 imaged patients (52.6%) had aneurysm shrinkage \u22655 mm, 15 (39.5%) had no change in diameter, and three patients (7.9%) had an increase in aneurysm diameter of \u22655 mm. There were no conversions, fractures, compressions, or aneurysm ruptures of the treated segment through 2 years.\nThis next-generation thoracic endograft has a low rate of major device events through 2 years, with no graft compressions or device failures. The data for this new endograft demonstrate favorable outcomes and confirm low risks for treatment for patients with TAA. Follow-up will be continued for 5 years.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.",

The incision is 1 to 2 cm above the clavicle, 1 cm lateral to the midline, and 5 to 7 cm long. Subplatysmal skin flaps are created. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is mobilized on its lateral edge and retracted but not divided. The scalene fat pad is split vertically, the omohyoid muscle excised, and the C5 nerve root dissected free. The accessory phrenic nerve is identified, if present, arising medially from C5, and preserved. The rest of the plexus is dissected free, muscular and connective tissue removed from all nerve roots and trunks, and the subclavian artery identified. The phrenic nerve is identified on the medial edge of the anterior scalene muscle (ASM). The ASM is divided on the first rib. The ASM is elevated, freed, and divided as high as possible and free of C5. The middle scalene muscle is dissected. C5 and C6 branches of the long thoracic nerve are identified and protected as the portion of middle scalene muscle adjacent to the nerves of the plexus is excised. The decision on whether the first rib is to be removed is determined by whether the lower trunk of the plexus is touching the first rib. If the rib is removed, its posterior end is freed, divided, and 1 cm excised. The rest of the rib is freed from the intercostal muscles with a periosteal elevator or harmonic scalpel, the pleura is separated from the inner surface of the rib, and the anterior end divided with an infraclavicular rib cutter. The operation has been made safer by identifying and dissecting the C5 nerve root before looking for the phrenic nerve.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive alternative for type II endoleak repair after endovascular aneurysm repair. However, control of lumbar and median sacral arteries is considered technically difficult due to the dense inflammatory tissue surrounding the aorta. We describe a technical tip that avoids close dissection of the aneurysm sac. After the transperitoneal approaches we commonly use during laparoscopic aortic surgery, the aneurysm is drawn rightward to access the plane of the anterior longitudinal ligament. This technique allows a direct exposure of the lumbar and median sacral arteries, which are all methodically dissected and ligated along the anterior wall of the spine without close dissection of the aneurysm sac. In our experience, this technical tip was always feasible and simplified laparoscopic type II endoleak repair.",

    "abstract": "In 2008, the top priority in our division's 5-year strategic plan was \"to become an internationally recognized center of excellence for the endovascular treatment of complex aortic pathology extending from the aortic valve to the external iliac artery.\" Five components were identified as \"most critical\" to achieve this strategic priority: (1) training at centers of excellence in complex endovascular repair; (2) industry partnership to improve access to developing technologies; (3) a fully integrated team approach with one leader involved in all steps of all cases; (4) prospective data collection; and (5) development and implementation of a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption for juxtarenal, pararenal, and thoracoabdominal aneurysms. We have now performed 49 repairs (16 commercially manufactured devices, 33 physician-modified devices) for 3 common iliac, 20 juxtarenal, 9 pararenal, and 17 thoracoabdominal aneurysms, using 142 fenestrations, branches, and scallops. All patients had complete 30-day follow-up for calculation of 30-day events. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate 1-year events. In 5 years, we developed a successful complex endovascular aortic program that uses fenestrated/branched repair techniques. A focused team strategic planning approach to program development is an effective way for vascular surgery divisions to gain experience and expertise with new complex technologies while ensuring acceptable patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "As investigations into nonsurgical treatment for atherosclerosis expand, the measurement of plaque regression and progression has become an important end point to evaluate. Measurements of three-dimensional (3D) plaque volume are more reliable and sensitive to change than are traditional estimates of stenosis severity or cross-sectional area. 3D ultrasound (3D US) imaging may allow monitoring of plaque volume changes but has not been used routinely due to the cumbersome motorized units required to drive transducers. We investigated the variability, reliability, and the least amount of change detectable by 1D plaque measures, as well as 2D and 3D measures of plaque morphometry, that can be applied in a clinical environment.\n3D US imaging was obtained in 10 patients with carotid stenosis. The lumen and outer wall boundaries were outlined in serial cross-sectional images 1 mm apart. Three observers manually segmented vessel wall volumes (VWVs), and the segmentation was repeated again 4 weeks later. This allowed measurement of interobserver and intraobserver variability of 6 pairs of observations. We measured Bland-Altman statistics, intraclass correlation coefficients, coefficient of variability, and the minimum detectable plaque change for each morphometric measure.\nThe mean VWV of carotid lesions in the study was 1276.8 mm(3) (range, 620.6-1956.3 mm(3)). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated low interobserver and intraobserver variability. The interobserver variability of volume measurements as a function of mean volume was 14.8% and interobserver variability was 8.9%. Reliability was 87% as quantified by the interclass correlation and was 95% by the intraclass correlation. The least detectable change in VWV was 12.9% for interobserver variability and 4.5% for intraobserver variability for the three observers.\nCarotid plaque diameter measurements from B-mode images have high variability. Plaque burden, as estimated by VWV, can be measured reliably with a 3D US technique using a clinical scanner. The volumetric change, with 95% confidence, that must be observed to establish that a plaque has undergone growth or regression is \u223c12.9% for different observers and 4.5% for the same observer performing the follow-up study.",

    "abstract": "Combat extremity wounds are complex and frequently require an immediate vascular reconstruction in the operational environment followed by delayed tissue coverage at a stateside medical treatment facility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate limb salvage outcomes after combat-related vascular reconstruction that subsequently required delayed soft tissue coverage during the Global War on Terror.\nPatients who incurred a war-related extremity injury necessitating an immediate vascular intervention followed by definitive limb reconstruction requiring flap coverage from combat injuries were reviewed. Patient demographics, types of vascular and extremity injuries, and surgical interventions were examined. Outcomes included limb salvage, primary and secondary graft patency, flap outcomes, and complications. Differences between upper extremities (UEs) and lower extremities (LEs) were compared.\nFrom 2003 to 2012, 27 patients were treated for combat-related extremity injuries with an immediate vascular reconstruction followed by delayed tissue coverage. Fifteen LEs and 12 UEs were treated. The mean age was 24 years. An explosion was the cause in 77% of patients, with a mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 19. An autogenous vein bypass was the most common reconstruction performed in 20 patients (74%). Other vascular repairs included a primary repair, a patch angioplasty with bovine pericardium, and a bypass with use of a prosthetic graft. Eight patients (30%) had a concomitant venous injury, and 23 (85%) had a bone fracture. Thirty flaps were performed at a mean of 33 days from the original injury. Pedicle flaps were used in 24 limbs and free tissue flaps in six limbs. Muscle, fasciocutaneous, bone, and composite flaps were used for tissue coverage. At a mean follow-up of 16 months, primary patency rates of all arterial reconstructions were 66% in the UE and 53% in the LE (P = .69). Secondary patency rates were 100% in the UE and 86% in the LE (P = .48). The overall limb salvage rate was 81%. Limb salvage rates were 66% in the LE and 100% in the UE (P = .04). Three amputated lower limbs (60%) had inline flow to the foot. The flap success rate was 96%. Reasons for amputation included arterial thrombosis, flap failure, persistent soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, and debilitating peripheral nerve injuries with associated chronic pain.\nImmediate vascular repair followed by delayed tissue coverage can be performed with a high (>80%) limb salvage rate after combat trauma. Limb salvage rates were higher in the UE despite equivocally high arterial patency rates. Wounded warriors can expect limb salvage by use of this international algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported mixed results after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and we previously reported the perioperative outcome in patients with CRI by use of serum creatinine (Cr) level and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, only a few of these studies used GFR by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation in their analysis of long-term outcome.\nDuring the study period, 1000 CEAs (926 patients) were analyzed; 940 of these CEAs had Cr levels and 925 had GFR data.

By Kaplan-Meier analysis, stroke-free survival rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 97%, 94%, and 92% for Cr <1.5; 92%, 85%, and 81% for Cr \u22651.5 to 2.9; and 56%, 56%, and 56% for Cr \u22653 (P < .0001); vs 98%, 95%, and 93% for a GFR \u226560; 93%, 90%, and 86% for a GFR of \u226530 to 59; and 86%, 77%, and 73% for a GFR <30 (P < .0001). These rates for asymptomatic patients at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 97%, 95%, and 93% for Cr <1.5; 94%, 87%, and 82% for Cr \u22651.5 to 2.9; and 56%, 56%, and 56% for Cr \u22653 (P < .0001); vs 98%, 95%, and 94% for a GFR \u226560; 95%, 91%, and 86% for a GFR of \u226530 to 59; and 84%, 80%, and 75% for a GFR <30 (P = .0026). A univariate regression analysis for asymptomatic patients showed that the hazard ratio (HR) of stroke and death was 6.5 (P = .0003) for a Cr \u22653 and 3.1 for a GFR <30 (P = .0089). A multivariate analysis showed that Cr \u22653 had an HR of stroke and death of 4.7 (P = .008), and GFR <30 had an HR of 2.2 (P = .097).\nPatients with severe CRI had higher rates of combined stroke/death. Therefore, CEA for these patients (particularly in asymptomatic patients) must be considered with caution.",

    "abstract": "Accurate measurement of true aortic luminal diameter (ALD) is critical for endograft sizing in endovascular treatment of blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI), but ALD is dynamic and changes with respect to patients' hemodynamic status. This study aimed to characterize how ALD at the time of diagnosis of BTAI compares with ALD at the time of endovascular repair and later at follow-up.\nThis is an Institutional Review Board-approved, single-institution retrospective analysis of prospectively obtained data. Patients were included who presented between July 2007 and December 2012 with computed tomography angiography (CTA)-diagnosed BTAI; who underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR); and who underwent preoperative CTA, intraoperative intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and postimplantation CTA. Comparison measurements of the ALD were made among CTA and IVUS images at the level of the left subclavian artery (LSCA) and between initial CTA and postimplantation CTA at 10, 15, and 20 cm distal to the LSCA. Theoretical endograft sizes were determined and compared for each ALD at the LSCA.\nTwenty-two patients were included in the analysis. Mean age was 38 \u00b1 14 years (range, 17-61 years), with 82% men and mean Injury Severity Score of 43 \u00b1 11 (range, 24-66). Mean time from emergency department admission to initial CTA was -1.2 \u00b1 5 hours (range, -13 to 11.5 hours; negative time implies imaging at an outside facility before admission). Mean time from initial CTA to IVUS was 1.2 \u00b1 1.4 days (range, 2.5 hours-5.7 days) and from IVUS to postimplantation CTA 33 \u00b1 45 days (range, 17 hours-169 days). Overall, ALD measured by IVUS was significantly larger than that by initial CTA (\u03942.5 \u00b1 3.1 mm; P < .05). ALD was also larger at 10, 15, and 20 cm distal to the LSCA in comparing the postimplantation CTA with the initial CTA (\u03942.4, 2.0, and 2.0 mm, respectively; all P < .05). More than half the devices would be sized differently with ALD measured by IVUS at the time of TEVAR vs initial CTA.\nThe ALD of patients with BTAI is significantly larger when it is measured by IVUS at the time of TEVAR compared with at the time of initial CTA. This difference in ALD may translate to undersizing of endografts used in TEVAR for BTAI. IVUS at the time of TEVAR provides a more accurate measurement of the actual ALD and should be used for endograft sizing for patients with BTAI.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effect of perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) on long-term kidney dysfunction and death after lower extremity revascularization. Perioperative AKI is commonly seen in the form of mild rises of serum creatinine after major cardiovascular surgeries. Its effect on long-term survival and development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well established in cardiac surgery patients. However, there are no data on the effect of AKI on long-term outcomes after revascularization for lower limb ischemia.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the patients with peripheral arterial occlusive diseases who underwent endovascular or surgical revascularization of the lower extremities from 2001 through 2010. All demographic and clinical information have been maintained prospectively by the surgeon and followed up by the research team. Perioperative AKI was defined as rises of \u22650.3 mg/dL in serum creatinine from the values measured preoperatively. The primary end points were development of CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min) and all-cause mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine relevant associations.\nWithin the study period, 717 patients underwent 875 procedures. Mean follow-up was 42 \u00b1 14 months. AKI developed in 86 patients after the index procedure. Overall prevalence of CKD diagnosed postoperatively was 14.9%. Overall mortality reported within the follow-up period was 55.9%. Perioperative AKI was a significant predictor of CKD (area under the curve, 0.84 \u00b1 0.13) and all cause mortality (area under the curve, 0.82 \u00b1 0.12).\nPerioperative AKI is associated with an increased occurrence of CKD and a higher mortality rate after revascularization procedures of the lower extremities.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and objective preoperative assessment of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains problematic. Preoperative variables correlate with increased morbidity and mortality, yet no easily implemented tool exists to stratify patients. We determined the relationship between our fully implemented frailty-based bedside Risk Analysis Index (RAI) and complications after CEA.\nPatients undergoing CEA in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2005 to 2011 were included. Variables of frailty RAI were matched to preoperative NSQIP variables, and outcomes including stroke, mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and length of stay were analyzed. We further analyzed patients who were symptomatic and asymptomatic before CEA.\nWith use of the NSQIP database, 44,832 patients undergoing CEA were analyzed (17,696 [39.5%] symptomatic; 27,136 [60.5%] asymptomatic). Increasing frailty RAI score correlated with increasing stroke, death, and MI (P < .0001) as well as with length of stay. RAI demonstrated increasing risk of stroke and death on the basis of risk stratification (low risk [0-10], 2.1%; high risk [>10], 5.0%). Among patients undergoing CEA, 88% scored low (<10) on the RAI. In symptomatic patients, the risk of stroke and death for patients with a score of \u226410 is 2.9%, whereas if the RAI score is 11 to 15, it is 5.0%; 16 to 20, 6.9%; and >21, 8.6%.

    "abstract": "Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a known complication of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) repair and can occur with either endovascular (EVAR) or open repair. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism for the development of ACS may differ for patients treated with EVAR or open operation.\nAll patients who presented with rAAA at a tertiary care medical center between January 2005 and December 2010 were included in the study. Demographic factors, type of repair (open vs EVAR), development of ACS, intraoperative and postoperative fluid requirements, estimated blood loss, length of stay, and morbidity and mortality were recorded. Student t-test and Fisher exact test were performed. A P value < .05 was considered significant.\nSeventy-three patients, 62 men and 11 women with an average age of 70.5 years, were treated for rAAA. Forty-four (60%) underwent open repair; 29 (40%) had EVAR. Overall mortality was 42% (31 of 73), with mortality being 31% (9 of 29) in EVAR and 48% (21 of 44) in open repair. ACS developed in 21 patients (29%), more frequently in open repair than in EVAR (15 of 44 [34%] vs 6 of 29 [21%]; P = NS). Mortality was higher in patients who developed ACS compared with those without ACS (13 of 21 [62%] vs 17 of 52 [33%]; P = .022). This finding was especially pronounced in the EVAR group, in which mortality in patients with ACS was 83% (5 of 6) compared with 17% (4 of 23) without ACS (P = .005). Intraoperative fluid requirements were significantly higher in EVAR patients who developed ACS compared with those without ACS, including packed red blood cells (5600 mL vs 1100 mL; P < .0001), total blood products (9300 mL vs 1500 mL; P < .001), crystalloid (11,200 mL vs 4500 mL; P < .001), and estimated blood loss (5000 mL vs 660 mL; P = .006). In patients treated with open repair, there were no significant differences in intraoperative fluid requirements between those who developed ACS and those without ACS. However, patients who developed ACS after open repair required significantly more crystalloid on the first and second postoperative days (first postoperative day, 8300 mL vs 5600 mL [P = .01]; second postoperative day, 6500 mL vs 3800 mL [P = .004]).\nThis study demonstrates that the development of ACS after repair of rAAA is associated with increased mortality, especially in EVAR-treated patients. The higher intraoperative blood and blood product requirements associated with ACS in EVAR patients suggest that one potential cause of early ACS is continued hemorrhage from lumbar and inferior mesenteric vessels through the ruptured aneurysm sac. Hence, open ligation of such vessels should be considered in patients developing early ACS after EVAR for rAAA.",

    "abstract": "A recent prospective study found that fenestrated endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (FEVAR) was safe and effective in appropriately selected patients at experienced centers. As this new technology is disseminated to the community, it will be important to understand how this technology compares with standard endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). The goal of this study was to compare the outcomes of FEVAR vs EVAR of AAAs.\nThe American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 to 2012 was queried for AAAs (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 441.4). Patients were stratified according to procedure (FEVAR vs EVAR). A bivariate analysis was done to assess preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for postoperative outcomes. Thirty-day postoperative mortality and complication rates were described for each procedure type. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between the type of procedure and the risk of postoperative complications.\nA total of 458 patients underwent FEVAR and 19,060 patients underwent EVAR for AAA. Patients undergoing FEVAR were older (P = .02) and less likely to have a bleeding disorder (P = .046). Otherwise, the incidence of comorbidities in both groups was similar. FEVAR was associated with increased median operative time (156 vs 137 minutes; P < .001), and average postoperative length of stay (3.3 vs 2.8 days; P = .03). There was a statistically significant increase in overall complications (23.6% vs 14.3%; P < .001) and postoperative transfusions (15.3% vs 6.1%, P < .001) and trends toward increased cardiac complications (2.2% vs 1.3%; P = .09) and the need for dialysis (1.5% vs 0.8%; P = .08) in the FEVAR group. Mortality (2.4% vs 1.5%; P = .12) was not statistically different. On multivariable analysis, FEVAR remained independently associated with the need for postoperative transfusions when operative time was <75th percentile (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.72; P = .02) as well as when operative time was >75th percentile for respective procedures (adjusted odds ratio, 5.33; 95% confidence interval, 3.55-8.00; P < .001).\nPatients undergoing FEVAR are more likely than patients undergoing EVAR to receive blood transfusions postoperatively and are more likely to sustain postoperative complications. Although mortality was similar, trends toward increased cardiac and renal complications may suggest the need for judicious dissemination of this new technology. Future research with larger number of FEVAR cases will be necessary to determine if these associations remain.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) has advanced over time. Constant development of new endovascular techniques has converted these into the most attractive methods available today. However, results for each endovascular procedure are still limited, and available data have emerged from studies examining only a small number of cases. The present retrospective review was designed to examine early and late results for PAA treatment and to identify possible factors associated with graft patency.\nThis was a retrospective review of all PAAs treated from January 1993 to December 2013. Symptomatic and asymptomatic PAAs >2 cm treated using open surgery or an endovascular procedure were included. Kaplan-Meier curves and the Breslow test were used to analyze data.\nA total of 171 aneurysms were treated in 142 men (mean age, 69.3 years); of these, 53.3% were asymptomatic and 18.7% presented as acute ischemia. Saphenous vein was used for bypass in 57.9% of the patients, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) in 23.4%, and a stent graft in 18.7%. In the open surgical group, a popliteal-popliteal bypass was performed in 37.4% and a distal anastomosis to a tibial vessel was required in 14.4%. Good runoff (two to three vessels) was present in 69%. Perioperative mortality (30 days) was 1.8%. Of eight early occlusions recorded, five (2.9%) underwent reoperations. Major amputations were needed in five patients (all with previous acute ischemia). Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 49 months (range, 1-228 months). Primary and secondary patency rates at 24, 36, and 60 months were 76.3% and 89.5%, 73.4% and 87.4%, and 68.3% and 80.9%, respectively. Popliteal-popliteal bypasses showed better primary patency at 24 months when saphenous vein was used vs ePTFE (94.9% vs 79%; P = .04); however, similar patency rates were recorded for short ePTFE bypasses and stent grafts (79% vs 79.7%). On multivariate analysis, only poor runoff emerged as an independent factor for worse primary patency (hazard ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-7.2; P = .001).\nThe open repair of PAA offers good long-term results, especially in asymptomatic patients, those undergoing elective surgery, and those showing good runoff. Given the also good midterm outcomes of endovascular treatment, this may be a feasible option in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Interventions on arteriovenous (AV) access are typically performed with a direct puncture into the fistula. An alternative is the transradial approach (TRA), which offers the advantage of visualizing both the arterial and venous limbs as well as any juxta-anastomotic stenosis, all through one access.\nFrom September 2010 to 2013, 511 fistulograms were performed on 322 patients, 55 of which were TRA procedures in 40 patients (50% male; mean age, 60.4 \u00b1 16.5 years). Of these, 37 of 40 accesses (92.5%) were AV fistulas, and 54 of 55 interventions (98%) were performed for stenotic lesion(s). There were 37 initial interventions, 13 secondary inventions, and five diagnostic fistulograms through the TRA. Stenotic lesions were juxta-anastomotic in 28, venous in 11, or both in 11. Mean follow-up was 14.3 months in 37 of 40 patients. Outcomes included technical and clinical success, complications, functional patency, and flow rate changes.\nAll TRA punctures were successful, with no radial artery thromboses or hand ischemia. Technical success was 88% (44 of 50). Functional patency rates were 88.5% (23 of 26), 84.2% (16 of 19), and 83% (10 of 12) at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The complication rate was 1.8% (one of 55), consisting of AV fistula rupture after angioplasty. The average flow rate in the 20 juxta-anastomotic stenosis increased from 637 mL/min to 1094 mL/min (P = .01) after the procedure.\nThe TRA is a practical option with functional patency rates that are comparable to traditional approaches when intervening on a malfunctioning dialysis access in the appropriately selected patient. No hand ischemia was noted. This approach may be particularly attractive for treatment of juxta-anastomotic stenoses in a variety of AV accesses and offers unique practical advantages for the maintenance of AV accesses.",

    "abstract": "Dialysis access-associated steal syndrome (DASS) complicates arteriovenous access surgery. We describe a 10-year experience with the surgical management of DASS.\nDASS operations were retrospectively reviewed from July 2003 to July 2013 from a single academic institution. Demographics, symptoms, surgical details, and outcomes were collected.\nA total of 201 patients had 218 episodes of DASS. Mean age was 65 years, and 62% were women. DASS was caused by 175 arteriovenous fistulas (80%), 41 upper extremity prosthetic grafts (19%), and two thigh grafts (1%); 87% were brachial artery based. A portion (22%) were referred for DASS from outside practices. All patients had grade 2 (48%) or grade 3 (52%) DASS; 92% (185) were available for follow-up, with a median time to first follow-up of 23 days. Surgical procedures included ligation (73), distal revascularization with interval ligation (DRIL) (59), revision using distal inflow (RUDI) (21), banding (38), proximalization of arterial inflow (12), and distal radial artery ligation (13). There were no differences in preoperative comorbidities between treatment groups. The 30-day complications included continued steal, thrombosis, bleeding, infection, and mortality. Ligation and DRIL were performed most often for grade 3 steal. Ligation and banding were performed most acutely (median time to intervention after access creation of 39 and 24 days vs DRIL and RUDI at 97 and 100 days). Fistula preservation was 0% for ligation, 100% for DRIL, 95% for RUDI, and 89% for banding (P < .01). Improvement of symptoms ranged from 75% (banding) to 98% (DRIL) (P = .005). Women were less likely to have DRIL but more likely to have ligation (P = .001). Complications were highest in the banding (49%) and RUDI (37%) groups. Average mortality was 3.5%, with no significant differences among groups. During the study period, 3287 access procedures were performed, and access volume steadily increased (2003-2008, 1312 access creations; 2008-2013, 1975). Percentage of fistulas (79% vs 86%), incidence of steal (4% vs 6%), and percentage of DRILs (25% vs 28%) were consistent across the two study periods.\nDRIL and ligation were performed in patients with the most severe symptoms. Compared with ligation, DRIL has equal symptom resolution, no increase in complications, and fistula preservation. Compared with banding, DRIL resulted in superior fistula preservation and fewer complications. DRIL should be considered the preferred procedure for management of DASS in patients with a functioning autologous fistula who can tolerate a major operation.",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular procedures have become popular for the treatment of patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease, open surgical bypass is still required in a significant proportion of patients. Saphenous vein is the conduit of choice, but prosthetic bypass grafts are often necessary. The Peripheral Bypass Grafting: Prospective Evaluation of FUSION Vascular Graft for Above Knee Targets (PERFECTION) trial was performed to assess the clinical outcome of the FUSION vascular graft (Maquet Cardiovascular, Wayne, NJ), a novel bilayer prosthetic graft with an external expanded polytetrafluoroethylene inner layer and an outer knit polyester layer.\nEligible study patients included those requiring prosthetic femoral-to-above-knee popliteal bypass for claudication, rest pain, or localized tissue loss without wet gangrene. During a 30-month period ending in March 2012, 117 patients were enrolled in the PERFECTION trial and underwent bypass with FUSION vascular grafts at 10 European investigational sites. Patients were followed up with duplex ultrasound imaging and ankle-brachial indices performed at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary efficacy end point was 12-month primary patency of the study graft, assessable in 102 patients. Safety end points included all-cause mortality, major adverse events, amputation, and graft reinterventions.\nThe 67 male (57.3%) and 50 female (42.7%) patients averaged 67.8 \u00b1 8.9 years in age and were implanted with 6-mm (25 [21.4%]), 7-mm (26 [22.2%]), or 8-mm (66 [56.4%]) FUSION grafts. The 30-day primary graft patency was 95.3%, with five graft occlusions in the perioperative period. The 12-month primary rate was 85.6%, and the secondary patency rate was 93.2%. Ankle-brachial indices increased from a mean of 0.53 \u00b1 0.20 preoperatively to 0.97 \u00b1 0.16 at 30 days and 0.91 \u00b1 0.22 at 12 months. There were no major amputations through 12 months of follow-up, 15 patients (12.8%) had graft reinterventions, one patient (0.9%) developed a graft infection, and five patients (4.3%) died of unrelated causes.\nThe findings of the prospective, multicenter PERFECTION study confirm clinical utility of the FUSION vascular graft through 12 months of follow-up. Patency rates equal or exceed those reported with other nonbioactive vascular grafts. These observations suggest that the FUSION graft is a useful alterative to standard expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and should be considered as an option in patients requiring prosthetic femoral-to-above-knee popliteal arterial reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The role of endovascular repair (EVAR) of aortic aneurysms in young patients is controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term outcomes and reintervention rates in patients 60 years of age or younger who underwent elective open or endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nRetrospective review of a prospectively collected vascular surgery database at a university-affiliated medical center was performed to identify all patients who underwent elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm between 2000 and 2013 and were 60 years of age or younger at the time of the repair. Preoperative anatomic measurements were performed and compared with instructions for use (IFU) criteria for the endografts.\nThe study cohort comprised 169 patients 60 years of age or younger (mean age, 56.7 \u00b1 2.8 years) who underwent elective repair (119 open repair, 50 EVAR). Patients treated with open repair and EVAR had similar comorbidities, except that EVAR patients were more likely to have hypertension (P = .03) and poor left ventricular function (P = .04). The open repair group had significantly larger suprarenal (P = .004) and infrarenal (P = .005) neck angles, shorter neck lengths (P < .001), and larger maximum aneurysm diameter (P = .02) compared with the EVAR group. Only five patients (13%) in the EVAR group did not meet all IFU criteria. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 1.8% (0% EVAR, 2.5% open repair; P = .56). Overall mean life expectancy was 11.5 years (9.8 years EVAR, 11.9 years open repair; P = .09). The 1-year (98% EVAR, 96% open repair), 5-year (86% EVAR, 88% open repair), and 10-year (54% EVAR, 75% open repair) survival did not differ between EVAR and open repair (P = .16). Long-term survival (78% EVAR, 85% open repair; P = .09) and reintervention rates (12% EVAR, 16% open repair; P = .80) did not differ. No late aneurysm rupture or aneurysm-related deaths were observed. The most common causes of long-term mortality were malignant disease and cardiovascular events. Reinterventions in the open repair group were exclusively laparotomy related (incisional hernia repairs), whereas all reinterventions in the EVAR group were aortic related, including one conversion to open repair.\nAfter elective aneurysm repair, younger patients have a moderate life expectancy related to malignant disease and cardiovascular health. EVAR offers durability and long-term survival similar to those with open repair in these younger patients as long as aneurysm anatomy and IFU are adhered to.",

    "abstract": "We conducted our study to describe the incidence, presentation, management, risk factors, and outcomes of lower extremity weakness (LEW) after elective endovascular aneurysm repair with multibranched thoracoabdominal stent grafts.\nExcluding symptomatic patients and those with aortic dissection, between July 2005 and October 2013, 116 patients with aortic aneurysms were treated in a prospective, single-center trial of multibranched endovascular aneurysm repair. LEW that resolved within 30 days of operation was classified as transient. Persistent LEW was defined as inability to walk or stand 30 days after surgery. Perioperative spinal cord protection measures included bypass as needed to maintain flow to the subclavian and internal iliac arteries, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and permissive hypertension.\nPostoperative LEW occurred in 24 of 116 patients (20.6%). In 15 (12.9%), LEW was transient with full recovery. Nine patients (7.7%) had persistent LEW, three with paraparesis and six with paraplegia. Five of 24 patients (21%) awoke from anesthesia with LEW. Symptoms of LEW developed within 72 hours of operation in 14 of 24 (58%). Late-onset LEW (\u226572 hours postoperatively) always occurred in the presence of a precipitating hypotensive event (5 of 24; 21%). Univariate analysis showed no association between LEW and Crawford type, staged repair, aneurysm extent, or postoperative endoleak. Baseline glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (odds ratio [OR], 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-14.6; P = .03), fluoroscopy time >190 minutes (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.0-12.7; P = .04), and sustained hypotension (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.7; P = .04) were identified as independent risk factors for LEW in multivariate analysis.\nMost episodes of LEW after multibranched endovascular aneurysm repair are transient and do not occur in the operating room. Adjunctive strategies to maintain spinal perfusion, including cerebrospinal fluid drainage and permissive hypertension, may help prevent permanent LEW.",

Baseline glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (odds ratio [OR], 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-14.6; P = .03), fluoroscopy time >190 minutes (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.0-12.7; P = .04), and sustained hypotension (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.7; P = .04) were identified as independent risk factors for LEW in multivariate analysis.",

    "abstract": "Open (OPAR) and endovascular (EPAR) repair are both used to treat popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA). We assessed outcomes of both modalities in the treatment of asymptomatic PAAs.\nVascular Quality Initiative (VQI) databases (2010 to 2013) were queried for patients undergoing asymptomatic PAA repair using OPAR and EPAR. The groups were compared with respect to demographics, medical history, and procedural characteristics. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), major adverse limb events (MALE), MALE or perioperative death (MALE-POD), and loss of primary patency compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Proportional hazard Cox regression was used to compare the outcomes across the treatment groups. Multivariable regression with backward elimination procedure (\u03b1 = .5) was used to construct parsimonious models to predict MALE and MALE-POD. Gamma regression was used to compare LOS.\nFrom 2010 to 2013, 390 patients with asymptomatic PAAs were identified (221 OPAR, 169 EPAR) and included in this study. Preoperative comorbidities were similar between the two groups, except for a higher rate of congestive heart failure (19.5% vs 11.8%, P = .042) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19.5% vs 11.8%, P = .042) in the EPAR group. No in-hospital mortality was observed. LOS was significantly longer in the OPAR group (3.8 \u00b1 2.5 vs 1.4 \u00b1 1.9 days; P < .001). OPAR patients had a significantly higher MALE-free survival (95% vs 80%; P < .001) as was MALE-POD-free survival (93% vs 80%; P < .001) rates at 1 year after the procedure. OPAR was associated with lower hazard of MALE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.86; P < .05), MALE-POD (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.13-0.63; P < .05), and primary patency loss (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.58; P < .05).\nThis retrospective analysis suggests that OPAR is associated with better outcomes than EPAR. Ultimately, the ongoing, adequately powered Open versus Endovascular Popliteal Artery Aneurysm Repair (OVERPAR) trial will definitively compare these procedures.",

    "abstract": "For descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs), it is generally considered that thoracic endovascular aortic repairs (TEVARs) reduce operative morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair. However, long-term differences in survival of patients have not been demonstrated, and an increased need for aortic reintervention has been observed. Many assume that TEVAR becomes less cost-effective through time because of higher rates of reintervention and surveillance imaging. This study investigated midterm outcomes and hospital costs of TEVAR compared with open TAA repair.\nThis was a retrospective, single-institution review of elective TAA repairs between 2005 and 2012. Patient demographics, operative outcomes, reintervention rates, and hospital costs were assessed. The literature was also reviewed to determine commonly observed complication and reintervention rates for TEVAR and open repair. Monte Carlo simulation was used to model and to forecast hospital costs for TEVAR and open TAA repair up to 3 years after intervention.\nOur cohort consisted of 131 TEVARs and 27 open repairs. TEVAR patients were significantly older (67.2 vs 58.7 years old; P = .02) and trended toward a more severe comorbidity profile. Operative mortality for TEVAR and open repair was 5.3% and 3.7%, respectively (P = 1.0). There was a trend toward more complications in the TEVAR group, although not statistically significant (all P > .05). In-hospital costs were significantly greater in the TEVAR group ($52,008 vs $37,172; P = .001). However, cost modeling by use of reported complication and reintervention rates from the literature overlaid with our cost data produced a higher cost for the open group in-hospital ($55,109 vs $48,006) and at 3 years ($58,426 vs $52,825). Interestingly, TEVAR hospital costs, not reintervention rates, were the most significant driver of cost in the TEVAR group.\nOur institutional data showed a trend toward lower mortality and complication rates with open TAA repair, with significantly lower costs within this cohort compared with TEVAR. These findings were likely, at least in part, to be due to the milder comorbidity profile of these patients. In contrast, cost modeling by Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated lower costs with TEVAR compared with open repair at all time points up to 3 years after intervention. Our institutional data show that with appropriate selection of patients, open repair can be performed safely with low complication rates comparable to those of TEVAR. The cost model argues that despite the costs associated with more frequent surveillance imaging and reinterventions, TEVAR remains the more cost-effective option even years after TAA repair.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated, in a contemporary prospective series, the safety and efficacy of femoral endarterectomy using the eversion technique and compared our results with results obtained in the literature for the standard endarterectomy with patch closure.\nBetween 2010 and 2012, 121 patients (76% male; mean age, 68.7 years; diabetes, 28%; renal insufficiency, 20%) underwent 147 consecutive femoral bifurcation endarterectomies using the eversion technique, associating or not inflow or outflow concomitant revascularization. The indications were claudication in 89 procedures (60%) and critical limb ischemia in 58 (40%). Primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency of the femoral bifurcation, clinical improvement, limb salvage, and survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Factors associated with those primary end-points were evaluated with univariate analysis.\nThe technical success of eversion was of 93.2%. The 30-day mortality was 0%, and the complication rate was 8.2%; of which, half were local and benign. Median follow-up was 16 months (range, 1.6-31.2 months). Primary, primary assisted, and secondary patencies were, respectively, 93.2%, 97.2%, and 98.6% at 2 years. Primary, primary assisted, and secondary maintenance of clinical improvement were, respectively, 79.9%, 94.6%, and 98.6% at 2 years. The predictive factors for clinical degradation were clinical stage (Rutherford category 5 or 6, P = .024), platelet aggregation inhibitor treatment other than clopidogrel (P = .005), malnutrition (P = .025), and bad tibial runoff (P = .0016). A reintervention was necessary in 18.3% of limbs at 2 years: 2% involving femoral bifurcation, 6.1% inflow improvement, and 9.5% outflow improvement. The risk factors of reintervention were platelet aggregation inhibitor (other than clopidogrel, P = .049) and cancer (P = .011). Limb preservation at 2 years was 100% in the claudicant population. Limb salvage was 88.6% in the critical limb ischemia population, with a statistically higher rate for patients with malnutrition (P = .029), preoperative platelet count >450 \u00d710(9)/L (P = .0071), platelet aggregation inhibitor treatment other than clopidogrel (P = .022), preoperative deep femoral artery occlusion or stenosis >75% (P = .0064), and poor tibial runoff (P = .00042).\nEversion femoral bifurcation endarterectomy is a safe, efficient, and reproducible technique for the treatment of atherosclerotic femoral lesions. Advantages are notable, especially the lack of need for prosthetic angioplasty, eliminating the risk of patch infection or pseudoaneurysms and permitting direct puncture if endovascular procedures are needed for assisted patency.",

    "abstract": "Male sex is a nonmodifiable risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. Similar to humans, male mice are more susceptible to angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAAs than female mice. Previous studies demonstrated that castration of males markedly reduced the formation of AngII-induced AAAs. Progression of AAA size is associated with increased risk of aneurysm rupture. In this study, we hypothesized that castration of male mice would reduce the progression of established AngII-induced AAAs.\nMale apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were infused with AngII for 1 month to induce AAA formation. Aortic diameters were measured by ultrasound imaging, and mice were stratified into two groups that underwent a sham operation or castration. AngII infusions were continued for a further 2 months. Ultrasound imaging was used to quantify lumen diameters, and excised aortas were processed for quantification of AAA size, volume, and tissue characteristics.\nSham-operated mice exhibited progressive dilation of suprarenal aortic lumen diameters during the continued AngII infusion. Aortic lumen diameters were significantly decreased in castrated mice (n = 17) compared with sham-operated mice (n = 15) at study end point (1.63 \u00b1 0.04 vs 1.88 \u00b1 0.05 mm; P < .05). However, maximal external AAA diameters were not significantly different between sham-operated and castrated mice. The vascular volume/lumen volume ratio of excised AAAs imaged by ultrasound was significantly increased by castration (9.5% \u00b1 2.0%) vs sham operation (4.8% \u00b1 0.9%; n = 11 per group; P < .05). Moreover, compared with the thin-walled AAAs of sham-operated mice, aneurysm sections from castrated mice exhibited increased smooth muscle \u03b1-actin and collagen.\nRemoval of endogenous male hormones by castration selectively reduces aortic lumen expansion while not altering the external AAA dimensions.\nThere are no therapeutics that slow the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), and as the size of an AAA increases, so does the risk of rupture and death. Male sex is a nonmodifiable risk factor for AAA development, but whether male sex hormones have a similar effect on AAA progression is unclear. Removal of male sex hormones in an established mouse model of angiotensin II-induced AAAs resulted in reduced progressive lumen dilation while not altering external AAA dimensions. Therapies that limit androgen action may provide benefit against AAA progression. Alternatively, supplemental testosterone may be contraindicated in men diagnosed with an AAA.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a large genome-wide association study in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and control subjects identified nine loci associated with AAA. Besides the significant association of the rs1466535 single nucleotide polymorphism in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 gene (LRP1), two of eight remaining loci, rs6674171 in the tudor domain containing protein 10 (TDRD10) and rs3019885 in solute carrier family 30 zinc transporter member 8 (SLC30A8) gene, showed a weakly significant association with AAA requiring further attention. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the role of these three polymorphisms in conferring AAA genetic susceptibility.\nWe studied these three polymorphisms in 423 patients and 423 sex- and age-comparable control subjects from Italy. All subjects were genotyped with the use of the real-time TaqMan approach. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factor and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was used to estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for AAA risk.\nThe prevalence of carriers of the rs3019885 SLC30A8 G allele was higher in control subjects (67.8%) than in patients (60.3%, P = .022), suggesting a protective effect for AAA. The prevalence of carriers of the rs1466535 LRP1 T allele was higher in patients (51.8%) than in control subjects (39.7%, P = .0004), suggesting a risk effect for AAA. rs6674171 polymorphism genotype distribution did not differ between AAA patients and control subjects. In the multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for traditional AAA risk factors, only the rs1466535 polymorphism remained significantly associated with AAA (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.84; P = .01).\nOur findings confirm the role as significant and independent susceptibility factor for AAA of the rs1466535 LRP1 polymorphism (T allele) in an Italian population. Nevertheless, our findings consistently differed from previous published data because in the genome-wide association study, the risk allele was the most frequent rs1466535 C allele. Our findings are consistent with literature data of LRP1 knock-out mice developing atherosclerotic lesions and aortic dilatation and association of the T allele with reduced LRP1 gene expression in humans.\nOur work supports the evidence that the T allele of the rs1466535 LRP1 polymorphism is an independent risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Our findings are consistent with literature data of Lrp1 knock-out mice developing atherosclerotic lesions and aortic dilatation, and association of the T allele with reduced LRP1 gene expression in humans. These data could have a crucial role for developing future diagnostic or prognostic scores based on biohumoral, clinical, genetic, proteomic, and imaging data to be applied in everyday clinical practice in order to improve the management of these high-risk patients in consideration of their characteristics and pathophysiological complexity.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in skeletal muscle structure and function are important contributors to exercise intolerance and functional decline in peripheral arterial disease. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) would improve fatigue resistance and ameliorate the histopathological changes in skeletal muscle in a mouse model of peripheral arterial disease. We also anticipated that NAC treatment would lower the levels of biomarkers of oxidative damage in the ischemic muscle.\nMale Balb/c mice were subjected to bilateral ligation of the femoral artery and, after 2 weeks of recovery, received daily intraperitoneal injections of either NAC (150 mg/kg) or saline for 15 days. At the end of the treatment, the extensor digitorium longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were excised for assessment of contractile function in vitro and histological analysis. Free malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were measured in the gastrocnemius muscle.\nIn the soleus muscle, force after 10 minutes of submaximal tetanic stimulation (60 Hz, 300 ms trains, 0.3 trains/s) was higher (P < .05) in NAC-treated animals (45% \u00b1 3% of the initial value; n = 7) when compared with controls (30.3% \u00b1 3%; n = 8). No differences were found in fatigue development between groups in the EDL muscle (ligated NAC, 35.7% \u00b1 1.9%; ligated saline, 37.5% \u00b1 1.1%). In addition, there was a tendency for lower levels of connective tissue deposition in the soleus of animals treated with NAC (n = 6) when compared with those that received only saline (n = 9) (ligated NAC, 16% \u00b1 2% vs ligated saline, 24% \u00b1 2%; P = .057). No differences were found in lipid peroxidation or protein carbonyl levels between ligated saline and ligated NAC groups.\nTaken together, these results indicate that treatment with NAC improves fatigue resistance in the soleus but not the EDL muscle in a model of peripheral arterial insufficiency.\nDespite the increasing burden of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its detrimental consequences on the quality of life of the patients, few pharmacological therapies have shown to evoke meaningful effects on functional performance in these individuals. N-acetylcysteine is approved for clinical use, has minimal side effects and most important, has shown to consistently improve exercise performance in animals and humans. In this study, we showed, for the first time, that treatment with this drug at a dose amenable for clinical application evoked marked effects on fatigue resistance in the soleus muscle in a mouse model of PAD. These encouraging findings set the stage for translational studies to determine the acute and long-term impact of this drug on walking capacity in patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.\nWe retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.\nVulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.\nOur radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases.",

    "abstract": "As vascular surgeons strive to meet the Fistula First Initiative, some authors have observed a decrease in arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation rates in association with an increase in AVF creation. In May 2012, we adopted a practice change in an attempt to maintain the same high level of AVF creation while leading to a decrease in fistula failures.\nA retrospective study was conducted of all dialysis access procedures performed by a single vascular surgeon before (period 1; before May 1, 2012) and after (period 2; after May 1, 2012) the change in practice pattern. The adopted change included favoring the brachiocephalic location unless the patient was an ideal anatomic candidate for a radiocephalic AVF, creating a larger and standardized arteriotomy, and using a large venous footplate whenever possible. The main outcome measure was primary functional patency at 1 year. Secondary outcome measures included primary patency at 1 year, time to maturation, type of fistula created, steal syndrome, and tunneled hemodialysis catheter infections.\nOf 213 vascular access procedures performed, 191 (90%) were AVFs. There was no difference in use of AVFs between period 1 (93% AVFs) and period 2 (88% AVFs; P = .2). Use of brachiocephalic AVFs increased from 38% in period 1 to 56% in period 2 (P = .01), with a corresponding trend toward a decrease in radiocephalic AVFs in period 2 (36% in period 1 to 27% in period 2; P = .2). Primary functional patency at 1 year was 47% in period 1 and 63% in period 2 (P = .03). Primary patency at 1 year was 51% in period 1 and 70% in period 2 (P = .001). Time to reach functional maturation was decreased in period 2 (median, 76 vs 82.5 days; P = .046). There was no difference in steal syndrome (P = 1.0), and the incidence of hemodialysis catheter infections was lower in period 2 (0 vs 7 [7%]; P = .006).\nIncreasing brachiocephalic AVF creation and reducing our reliance on radiocephalic AVFs resulted in a significant increase in primary functional patency at 1 year. This was achieved while maintaining the same high percentage of fistulas, a lower rate of central catheter infections, and the same low incidence of steal syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Although placement of an open iliac conduit for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is generally felt to result in higher morbidity and mortality, published literature is scarce. Our objective was to assess 30-day outcomes after elective EVAR with an open iliac conduit using a multi-institutional database.\nPatients who underwent elective EVAR (n = 14,339) for abdominal aortic aneurysm were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2005 to 2011 database. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.\nAn open iliac conduit was used in 231 patients (1.6%), and the remainder had femoral exposure or percutaneous EVAR. Women comprised 32% of patients with iliac conduits in contrast to 17% of those without iliac conduits. Patients with iliac conduits were older and had a lower body mass index. Univariable analysis showed patients with open iliac conduits had a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia (3.0% vs 1.1%), ventilator dependence (4.8% vs 1.0%), renal failure (3.0% vs 0.7%), cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction (5.2% vs 1.1%), return to the operating room (9.1% vs 3.7%), major morbidity (16.0 vs 6.6%), and death (3.0% vs 0.9%). On multivariable analysis, the use of open iliac conduits was associated with higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.0) and 30-day major morbidity (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.3).\nPatients with open iliac conduits for EVAR are more likely to be female and have higher postoperative morbidity and mortality. For patients with complex iliac artery disease, conduits are a viable alternative after EVAR to be performed, albeit at an increased risk. These data do suggest the need for lower-profile grafts and other alternative strategies for navigating complex iliac artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Most patients undergoing elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are classified American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 3. However, the severity of systemic disease among these patients can vary, resulting in markedly different levels of fitness. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that ASA 3 patients with good self-reported exercise tolerance have better survival after EVAR.\nData for EVAR patients classified ASA 3 were extracted retrospectively from a prospectively collected registry database. Patients were split into two groups according to fitness level, based on their self-reported ability to climb stairs or to walk briskly for 1 km. Patient survival for each group was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models.\nDuring follow-up of 392 patients for a mean of 1.9 years, there were 64 deaths (16.3%), 13.4% in the more physically able group and 21.6% in the less able group. Self-reported inability to walk or to climb stairs was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 3.55; P < .0001). Following risk adjustment for a number of possible confounding variables, fitness remained significant (hazard ratio, 3.03; P = .0011).\nThis study has shown that among ASA 3 patients, self-reported exercise capacity is an excellent means of predicting survival. Physicians should consider the physical fitness of their ASA 3 patients when discussing treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 30% of autogenous vein grafts develop luminal narrowing and fail because of intimal hyperplasia or negative remodeling. We previously found that vein graft cells from patients who later develop stenosis proliferate more in\u00a0vitro in response to growth factors than cells from patients who maintain patent grafts. To discover novel determinants of vein graft outcome, we have analyzed gene expression profiles of these cells using a systems biology approach to cluster the genes into modules by their coexpression patterns and to correlate the results with growth data from our prior study and with new studies of migration and matrix remodeling.\nRNA from 4-hour serum- or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-stimulated human saphenous vein cells obtained from the outer vein wall (20 cell lines) was used for microarray analysis of gene expression, followed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis. Cell migration in microchemotaxis chambers in response to PDGF-BB and cell-mediated collagen gel contraction in response to serum were also determined. Gene function was determined using short-interfering RNA to inhibit gene expression before subjecting cells to growth or collagen gel contraction assays. These cells were derived from samples of the vein grafts obtained at surgery, and the long-term fate of these bypass grafts was known.\nNeither migration nor cell-mediated collagen gel contraction showed a correlation with graft outcome. Although 1188 and 1340 genes were differentially expressed in response to treatment with serum and PDGF, respectively, no single gene was differentially expressed in cells isolated from patients whose grafts stenosed compared with those that remained patent. Network analysis revealed four unique groups of genes, which we term modules, associated with PDGF responses, and 20 unique modules associated with serum responses. The \"yellow\" and \"skyblue\" modules, from PDGF and serum analyses, respectively, correlated with later graft stenosis (P\u00a0= .005 and P\u00a0= .02, respectively). In response to PDGF, yellow was also associated with increased cell growth. For serum, skyblue was also associated with inhibition of collagen gel contraction. The hub genes for yellow and skyblue (ie, the gene most connected to other genes in the module), scavenger receptor class A member 5 (SCARA5) and suprabasin (SBSN), respectively, were tested for effects on proliferation and collagen contraction. Knockdown of SCARA5 increased proliferation by 29.9%\u00a0\u00b1 7.8% (P\u00a0< .01), whereas knockdown of SBSN had no effect. Knockdown of SBSN increased collagen gel contraction by 24.2%\u00a0\u00b1 8.6% (P\u00a0< .05), whereas knockdown of SCARA5 had no effect.\nUsing weighted gene coexpression network analysis of cultured vein graft cell gene expression, we have discovered two small gene modules, which comprise 42 genes, that are associated with vein graft failure. Further experiments are needed to delineate the venous cells that express these genes in\u00a0vivo and the roles these genes play in vein graft healing, starting with the module hub genes SCARA5 and SBSN, which have been shown to have modest effects on cell proliferation or collagen gel contraction.",

    "results": "Neither migration nor cell-mediated collagen gel contraction showed a correlation with graft outcome. Although 1188 and 1340 genes were differentially expressed in response to treatment with serum and PDGF, respectively, no single gene was differentially expressed in cells isolated from patients whose grafts stenosed compared with those that remained patent. Network analysis revealed four unique groups of genes, which we term modules, associated with PDGF responses, and 20 unique modules associated with serum responses. The \"yellow\" and \"skyblue\" modules, from PDGF and serum analyses, respectively, correlated with later graft stenosis (P\u00a0= .005 and P\u00a0= .02, respectively). In response to PDGF, yellow was also associated with increased cell growth. For serum, skyblue was also associated with inhibition of collagen gel contraction. The hub genes for yellow and skyblue (ie, the gene most connected to other genes in the module), scavenger receptor class A member 5 (SCARA5) and suprabasin (SBSN), respectively, were tested for effects on proliferation and collagen contraction. Knockdown of SCARA5 increased proliferation by 29.9%\u00a0\u00b1 7.8% (P\u00a0< .01), whereas knockdown of SBSN had no effect. Knockdown of SBSN increased collagen gel contraction by 24.2%\u00a0\u00b1 8.6% (P\u00a0< .05), whereas knockdown of SCARA5 had no effect.",

    "abstract": "Markers containing dyes such as crystal violet (CAS 548-62-9) are routinely used on the adventitia of vein bypass grafts to avoid twisting during placement. Because little is known about how these dyes affect vein graft healing and function, we determined the effect of crystal violet on cell migration and proliferation, which are responses to injury after grafting.\nFresh human saphenous veins were obtained as residual specimens from leg bypass surgeries. Portions of the vein that had been surgically marked with crystal violet were analyzed separately from those that had no dye marking. In the laboratory, they were split into easily dissected inner and outer layers after removal of endothelium. This cleavage plane was within the circular muscle layer of the media. Cell migration from explants was measured daily as either (1) percentage of migration-positive explants, which exclusively measures migration, or (2) number of cells on the plastic surrounding each explant, which measures migration plus proliferation. Cell proliferation and apoptosis (Ki67 and TUNEL staining, respectively) were determined in dye-marked and unmarked areas of cultured vein rings. The dose-dependent effects of crystal violet were measured for cell migration from explants as well as for proliferation, migration, and death of cultured outer layer cells. Dye was extracted from explants with ethanol and quantified by spectrophotometry.\nThere was significantly less cell migration from visibly blue compared with unstained outer layer explants by both methods. There was no significant difference in migration from inner layer explants adjacent to blue-stained or unstained sections of vein because dye did not penetrate to the inner layer. Ki67 staining of vein in organ culture, which is a measure of proliferation, progressively increased up to 6\u00a0days in nonblue outer layer and was abolished in the blue outer layer. Evidence of apoptosis (TUNEL staining) was present throughout the wall and not different in blue-stained and unstained vein wall segments. Blue outer layer explants had 65.9\u00a0\u00b1 8.0\u00a0ng dye/explant compared with 2.1\u00a0\u00b1 1.3 for nonblue outer layer explants. Dye applied in\u00a0vitro to either outer or inner layer explants dose dependently inhibited migration (IC50\u223c10\u00a0ng/explant). The IC50s of crystal violet for outer layer cell proliferation and migration were 0.1 and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, whereas the EC50 for death was between 1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.\nCrystal violet inhibits venous cell migration and proliferation, indicating that alternative methods should be considered for marking vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "Although numerous studies have described the incidence of postoperative cranial nerve injury (CNI) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), there have been few attempts to identify risk factors for this complication.\nThe 2012 CEA-targeted American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to determine the incidence of CNI after CEA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of CNI after CEA, using a comprehensive array of patient-, carotid disease-, and procedure-related factors as potential predictor variables.\nOf the 3762 CEA patients who were included in our analysis, 84 (2.2%) were noted to have sustained CNI in the first 30 days after their operation. Independent predictors of this complication included age \u226580 years (reference group, <70 years; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for CNI, 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-3.03; P = .05), presence of a preoperative bleeding disorder (including patients in whom preoperative nonaspirin anticoagulation therapy was not stopped before CEA; AOR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.68; P = .04), duration of operation (AOR, 1.15 for each 30-minute interval beyond an operative time of 90 minutes; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = .001), and need for reoperation (AOR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.03-6.80; P = .04).\nOur study demonstrates clinically evident CNI to be a relatively uncommon event after CEA at institutions that participate in the CEA-targeted American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and identifies four separate factors that are independently associated with an increased risk of CNI.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is now a mainstay of therapy for abdominal aortic aneurysm, although it remains associated with significant expense. We performed a comprehensive analysis of EVAR delivery at an academic medical center to identify targets for quality improvement and cost reduction in light of impending health care reform.\nAll infrarenal EVARs performed from April 2011 to March 2012 were identified (N = 127). Procedures were included if they met standard commercial instructions for use guidelines, used a single manufacturer, and were billed to Medicare diagnosis-related group 238 (n = 49). By use of DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) quality improvement methodology (define, measure, analyze, improve, control), targets for EVAR quality improvement were identified and high-yield changes were implemented. Procedure technical costs were calculated before and after process redesign.\nPerioperative services and clinic visits were identified as targets for quality improvement efforts and cost reduction. Mean technical costs before the intervention were $31,672, with endograft implants accounting for 52%. Pricing redesign in collaboration with hospital purchasing reduced mean EVAR technical costs to $28,607, a 10% reduction in overall cost, with endograft implants now accounting for 46%. Perioperative implementation of instrument tray redesign reduced instrument use by 32% (184 vs 132 instruments), saving $50,000 annually. Unnecessary clinic visits were reduced by 39% (1.6 vs 1.1 clinic visits per patient) through implementation of a preclinic imaging protocol. There was no difference in mean length of stay after the intervention.\nComprehensive EVAR delivery redesign leads to cost reduction and waste elimination while preserving quality. Future efforts to achieve more competitive and transparent device pricing will make EVAR more cost neutral and enhance its financial sustainability for health care systems.",

Three-dimensional patient-specific dissection geometries were generated from computed tomography angiography and used in CFD simulations of pulsatile blood flow. Hemodynamic parameters including false lumen flow and wall shear stress were compared.\nPatients with rapid aneurysmal degeneration had a growth rate of 5.3 \u00b1 2.7 mm/mo compared with those with stable aortic diameters, who had rates of 0.2 \u00b1 0.02 mm/mo. Groups did not differ in initial aortic diameter (36.1 \u00b1 2.9 vs 34.4 \u00b1 3.6 mm; P = .122) or false lumen size (22.6 \u00b1 2.9 vs 20.2 \u00b1 4.5 mm; P = .224). In patients with rapidly expanding aneurysms, a greater percentage of total flow passed through the false lumen (78.3% \u00b1 9.3% vs 56.3% \u00b1 11.8%; P = .016). The time-averaged wall shear stress on the aortic wall was also significantly higher (12.6 \u00b1 3.7 vs 7.4 \u00b1 2.8 Pa; P = .028).\nHemodynamic parameters derived from CFD simulations of acute type B aortic dissections were significantly different in dissections complicated by aneurysm formation.

    "abstract": "Wound occurrence (WO) after major lower extremity amputation (MLEA) can be due to wound infection or sterile dehiscence. We sought to determine the association of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and other patient factors with overall WO, WO due to wound infection, and WO due to sterile dehiscence.\nThe medical records of all patients undergoing MLEA from August 1, 2011, to November 1, 2013, were reviewed. Demographic data, hemoglobin A1c level, albumin concentration, dialysis dependence, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), nasal MRSA colonization, and diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined as variables. The overall WO rate was determined, and the cause of WO was categorized as either a sterile dehiscence or a wound infection.\nEighty-three patients underwent 96 MLEAs during a 27-month period. The rates of overall WO, WO due to infection, and WO due to sterile dehiscence were 39%, 19%, and 19%, respectively (1% developed a traumatic wound). On univariate analysis, PVD, MRSA colonization, DM, and dialysis dependence were all associated with higher rates of overall WO (P < .05). On multivariate analysis, MRSA colonization was associated with higher rates of overall WO (P = .03) and WO due to wound infection (11% vs 45%; P < .01). DM and PVD were associated with higher rates of overall WO and WO due to sterile dehiscence on both univariate and multivariate analysis (P < .05).\nNasal MRSA colonization is associated with higher rates of overall WO and WO due to wound infection. DM and PVD are associated with higher rates of overall WO and WO due to sterile dehiscence but are not associated with WO due to wound infection. Further studies addressing the effect of nasal MRSA eradication on postoperative wound outcomes after MLEA are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The Zenith Alpha thoracic endograft (William Cook Europe, ApS, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) is a new low-profile thoracic endograft that has recently become commercially available in Europe. The reduced profile offers potential benefits and extended applicability, especially in patients with small or diseased iliofemoral vessels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed with the new Zenith Alpha thoracic endograft.\nFrom November 2013 to the present, Zenith Alpha thoracic stent grafts have been employed to treat 42 patients (31 men; median age, 71 years; range, 54-83 years) suffering from descending thoracic aortic disease: 34 degenerative aneurysms, 4 aortic ulcers, 2 false aneurysms following prior thoracic open repair, and 2 traumatic blunt injuries. The mean proximal neck length was 25 mm (range, 17-40 mm), with a mean access vessel diameter of 6.7 mm (range, 6-11 mm). In 11 cases, aortoiliac occlusive disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus type B and C lesions) was present. The proximal landing was in zone 1 in 2 cases, in zone 2 in 25 cases, in zone 3 in 11 cases, and in zone 4 in 4 cases.\nFifty-one endografts (45 proximal components and 6 distal components) were deployed in 42 patients. The endografts were deployed safely and effectively from one surgical femoral access site in all cases. In patients with associated aortoiliac disease, no adjunctive procedures for device insertion, except for predilation with balloon angioplasty in two cases, were required. No major complications related to the devices were observed in any of the patients during the postoperative course, and there was no perioperative mortality, paraparesis, or paraplegia. At 30 days, morbid events included one case of major stroke, two cases of transient acute renal failure, and one case of postimplantation syndrome. No access-related complications were recorded. Computed tomography performed within 6 months was obtained in 39 patients and confirmed 100% clinical success without device-related complications. No type I endoleaks or bird's beak effects were documented.\nOur early experience shows that deployment of the new Zenith Alpha endograft from a surgical femoral access is safe and effective in treating thoracic aortic aneurysms, aortic ulcers, and traumatic blunt injuries, even in patients with small or diseased access vessels. Endograft conformance to the aorta and exclusion of the aneurysm were satisfactory. Long-term durability remains to be evaluated.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that venous claudication is significantly more common among patients with Beh\u00e7et's disease (BD) and had proposed that this was a \"venous claudication\" because it was specifically more common among men with lower extremity venous thrombosis (LEVT). With this study, we reassessed the presence of claudication prospectively by a questionnaire and a treadmill exercise.\nWe studied all men: 61 BD patients with LEVT, 40 BD patients without vascular involvement, and 56 healthy controls. Venous claudication was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. In addition, patients were asked to walk on a treadmill for 10 minutes. Patients who experienced symptoms consistent with venous claudication but still able to walk and those who had to give up the treadmill exercise were noted. Ankle-brachial pressure indices measured before and after the treadmill test did not indicate any peripheral arterial disease.\nTwenty-one BD patients with LEVT (34%), two BD patients without vascular involvement (5%), and none of the healthy controls described venous claudication when assessed with the questionnaire (P < .001). There were significantly more patients who described claudication during the treadmill exercise among patients with LEVT (21%) compared with those with no vascular disease (8%) and healthy controls (2%) (P = .002). Finally, only those with LEVT (6 of 61) had to stop the treadmill challenge because of claudication.\nVenous claudication is a severe and frequent symptom, being present in up to one third of BD patients with LEVT. It impairs walking capacity in 10% of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Physician-modified endovascular grafts, with fenestrations added to accommodate major branch vessels, provide a means for endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms that are adjacent to the renal arteries. Manual measurements of vessel origin locations from computed tomography images, however, take time and can lead to errors in the positions of the fenestrations. To make the fenestration process faster and more accurate, we have developed a procedure to create custom templates that serve as patient-specific guides for graft fenestration. We use a three-dimensional printer to create a clear rigid sleeve that replicates the patient's aorta and includes holes placed precisely at the locations of the branch vessels. The sleeve is slipped over the graft, the locations of the openings are marked with a pen, and the fenestrations are created after the sleeve is removed. Custom fenestration templates can potentially save procedural costs and make minimally invasive aortic aneurysm repair available to more patients.",

    "abstract": "Although imaging surveillance is mandatory for all patients after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), many patients are not compliant with follow-up. We sought to determine predictors of compliance with EVAR surveillance and to examine how compliance with current surveillance protocols correlates with survival.\nWe analyzed 188 patients who underwent EVAR at our institution for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) between 2001 and 2011. The primary end point was compliance with post-EVAR surveillance recommendations. Univariate analysis included patient demographics and socioeconomic information, AAA characteristics, EVAR hospital course variables, late complications and secondary interventions, length of follow-up, smoking status, family history of AAA, driving distances, primary care providers, and medical comorbidities. Mortality was determined by the Social Security Death Index. Multinomial logistic regressions were fit to identify independent predictors of compliance. Survival plots were generated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine effect of compliance on survival after adjusting for confounders.\nOf 188 patients, 89 (47.3%) were 100% compliant with follow-up visits and imaging, 21 (11.1%) were moderately compliant by missing appointments, and 78 (41.4%) were lost to follow-up completely. Overall median age was 74 years, and 81.9% of patients were male. Late complications occurred in 77 patients (40.9%), secondary interventions were performed in 32 patients (17%), and 5-year mortality was 21.2%. Mean follow-up interval was >40 months for 100% compliant and moderately compliant patients and <20 months for those lost to follow-up (P < .0001). In adjusted analysis, late complications (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-5.55; P = .007), absence of social work consultation (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.12-5.27; P = .024), and family history of AAA (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.06-6.75; P = .037) were associated with 100% compliance, whereas shorter driving distances (P = .051) and shorter hospital stay (P = .056) approached significance. Transient ischemic attack or stroke (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.18-10.91; P = .024) was the only variable independently associated with moderate compliance. Compared with patients lost to follow-up, 100% compliant patients had worse survival (log-rank test, P = .033), whereas moderately compliant patients' survival was not significantly different (log-rank test, P = .149). In adjusted Cox regression analysis, 100% compliant patients had decreased survival duration (rate ratio, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.18-6.06; P = .018) compared with those lost to follow-up.\nFollow-up surveillance is incomplete for more than half of patients who undergo EVAR at our institution, and patient compliance can be predicted by covariates mentioned before. Compliance with current surveillance regimens does not confer a survival benefit. Further research individualizing surveillance protocols based on risk level of late complications and noncompliance and prospective studies examining resulting survival benefits of compliance are warranted.",

In adjusted Cox regression analysis, 100% compliant patients had decreased survival duration (rate ratio, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.18-6.06; P = .018) compared with those lost to follow-up.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine long-term predictors of target lesion reintervention (TLR) after subclavian artery stenting (SAS).\nThis was a single-center retrospective review of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic subclavian artery disease who underwent SAS between January 1999 and December 2013. Repeat intervention was only performed in patients with recurrent symptoms and \u226570% in-stent restenosis (ISR). TLR was defined as need for a repeat percutaneous intervention involving a previously stented area. Freedom from events (ISR and TLR) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the significant predictors of TLR and ISR.\nIndex procedures were performed on 139 arteries in 138 patients (69.6% female). Patients were an average age of 64.5 years, with major comorbidities of hypertension (80.4%), hyperlipidemia (72.5%), and tobacco use (60.1%). Also performed during the study period were 24 TLR procedures, resulting 166 SAS interventions attempted for patients with subclavian atherosclerotic disease during a 15-year span. Of 166 procedures, 163 (98.2%) were treated successfully. Stents were placed in all but two index arteries. The main indications for SAS were subclavian steal syndrome (48.9%), arm claudication (21.6%), and coronary steal syndrome (28.8%). The average preprocedure stenosis was 87.2% \u00b1 11.2%. For index procedures (139 arteries), duplex follow-up was available for 134 arteries (96.4%), with an overall ISR rate of 18.7% (25 of 134). Primary patency for the index procedures was 84.7% at 10 years. The overall TLR rate for the index procedures was 12.7% (17 cases). Seven patients required more than one secondary procedure. For all cases, the freedom from ISR was 91%, 77%, and 68% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, and freedom from TLR was 94%, 85%, and 82% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed the significant predictors of ISR were smoking/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; P = .001), age by decade (HR, 0.5; P < .001), discharged with statin therapy (HR, 0.3; P = .001), vessel diameter \u22647 mm (HR, 2.3; P = .028), and right-sided intervention (HR, 0.3; P = .040). The sole significant predictor of TLR was age by decade (HR, 0.6; P = .008).\nSAS has a high primary success and durability with satisfactory outcomes well beyond 10 years. ISR was more likely to develop in patients who were smokers with chronic obstructive disease or had a baseline vessel size of \u22647 mm. Younger age could be an independent risk factor for secondary intervention.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine whether there is additive benefit of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and clopidogrel compared with ASA monotherapy among patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.\nThis was an observational cohort analysis that included 629 patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia. The prevalence of patients taking ASA monotherapy vs DAPT was assessed monthly for up to 3 years. A propensity model was constructed to adjust for baseline demographic characteristics and to assess the effect of DAPT on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and major adverse limb events.\nAt baseline, 348 patients were taking DAPT and 281 were taking ASA monotherapy. During 3 years of follow-up, 50 events (20%) occurred in the DAPT group vs 59 (29%) in the ASA monotherapy group. After propensity weighting, DAPT use was associated with a decreased risk of MACEs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.96) and overall mortality (adjusted HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.89). No association was found between DAPT use and the risk of major amputation (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.37-1.29). In a subgroup of 94 patients who underwent point-of-care platelet function testing, 21% had decreased response to ASA and 55% had a decreased response to clopidogrel. No association was found between a reduced response to ASA or clopidogrel and adverse events at 1 year.\nDAPT may be associated with reduced rates of MACEs and death among patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Foundation partnered with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1999 to initiate a competitive career development program that provides a financial supplement to surgeon-scientists receiving NIH K08 or K23 career development awards. Because the program has been in existence for 15 years, a review of the program's success has been performed. Between 1999 and 2013, 41 faculty members applied to the SVS Foundation program, and 29 from 21 different institutions were selected as awardees, resulting in a 71% success rate. Three women (10%) were among the 29 awardees. Nine awardees (31%) were supported by prior NIH F32 or T32 training grants. Awardees received their K award at an average of 3.5 years from the start of their faculty position, at the average age of 39.8 years. Thirteen awardees (45%) have subsequently received NIH R01 awards and five (17%) have received Veterans Affairs Merit Awards. Awardees received their first R01 at an average of 5.8 years after the start of their K award at the average age of 45.2 years. The SVS Foundation committed $9,350,000 to the Career Development Award Program. Awardees subsequently secured $45,108,174 in NIH and Veterans Affairs funds, resulting in a 4.8-fold financial return on investment for the SVS Foundation program. Overall, 23 awardees (79%) were promoted from assistant to associate professor in an average of 5.9 years, and 10 (34%) were promoted from associate professor to professor in an average of 5.2 years. Six awardees (21%) hold endowed professorships and four (14%) have secured tenure. Many of the awardees hold positions of leadership, including 12 (41%) as division chief and two (7%) as vice chair within a department of surgery. Eight (28%) awardees have served as president of a regional or national society. Lastly, 47 postdoctoral trainees have been mentored by recipients of the SVS Foundation Career Development Program on training grants or postdoctoral research fellowships. The SVS Foundation Career Development Program has been an effective vehicle to promote the development and independence of vascular surgeon-scientists in the field of academic vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is a common comorbid condition among patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stent placement (CAS); however, the outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing CAS have not been fully examined. We sought to investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation on outcomes of CEA and CAS in general practice.\nWe analyzed the data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), which is representative of all admissions in the United States from 2005 to 2009. The primary end point was postoperative stroke, cardiac complication, postoperative mortality, and composite of these end points. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine, first, the association of atrial fibrillation (compared to without atrial fibrillation) and, second, the association of CEA (compared with CAS) in patients with atrial fibrillation with the occurrence of postoperative stroke, cardiac complication, or death. Covariates included in the logistic regression were the patient's gender, age, race/ethnicity, comorbid conditions, and symptom status (symptomatic vs asymptomatic status) and the hospital's characteristics.\nOf the total 672,074 patients who underwent CAS or CEA, 8.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7-8.9) of the procedures were performed in patients with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased risk of postoperative stroke in patients undergoing CEA (n\u00a0= 879 [1.7%]; P\u00a0< .0001; odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.32-1.86) but not in patients undergoing CAS. The relative risk of the composite end point of postoperative stroke, cardiac complications, and mortality was increased in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing CAS (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18-1.74) and in those undergoing CEA (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 2.89-3.49). After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds of the composite end point of postoperative stroke, cardiac complications, and mortality (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59) in atrial fibrillation patients were significantly higher among patients who underwent CEA (compared with those who underwent CAS). An opposite relationship was seen in patients without atrial fibrillation, in whom the composite end point was significantly lower in patients undergoing CEA.\nOur analysis suggests that almost 10% of CAS and CEA is performed in patients with atrial fibrillation in general practice, and higher rates of adverse events are observed among these patients, particularly those undergoing CEA.",

    "abstract": "Acute arterial occlusions occur in high shear rate hemodynamic conditions. Arterial thrombi are platelet-rich when examined histologically compared with red blood cells in venous thrombi. Prior studies of platelet biology were not capable of accounting for the rapid kinetics and bond strengths necessary to produce occlusive thrombus under these conditions where the stasis condition of the Virchow triad is so noticeably absent. Recent experiments elucidate the unique pathway and kinetics of platelet aggregation that produce arterial occlusion. Large thrombi form from local release and conformational changes in von Willebrand factor under very high shear rates. The effect of high shear hemodynamics on thrombus growth has profound implications for the understanding of all acute thrombotic cardiovascular events as well as for vascular reconstructive techniques and vascular device design, testing, and clinical performance.",

    "abstract": "Although the endovascular aneurysm repair trial 2 (EVAR-2) demonstrated no benefit of EVAR in high-risk (HR) patients, EVAR is still performed widely in this patient cohort. This study compares the midterm outcomes after EVAR in HR patients with those in normal-risk (NR) patients. In turn, these data are compared with the EVAR-2 data.\nA retrospective review from January 2006 to December 2013 identified 247 patients (75 HR [30.4%], 172 NR [69.6%]) who underwent elective EVAR for infrarenal aortic aneurysm in an academic tertiary institution and its affiliated Veterans Administration hospital. The same HR criteria used in the EVAR-2 trial were employed. Overall survival, graft-related complications, and reintervention rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. HR group outcomes were compared with the EVAR-2 data.\nHR patients had a larger abdominal aortic aneurysm size and had a higher prevalence of cardiac disease (P < .01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .02), renal insufficiency (P < .01), and cancer (P < .01). Use of aspirin (63% HR vs 66% NR; P = .6), statin (83% HR vs 72% NR; P = .2), and beta-blockers (71% HR vs 60% NR; P = .2) was similar; in the EVAR-2 trial, the corresponding use of these medications was 58%, 42%, and not available, respectively. Perioperative mortality (0% HR vs 1.2% NR; P = 1.0) and early complication rates (4% HR vs 6% NR; P = .8) were similar. In contrast, perioperative mortality in the EVAR-2 trial was 9%. At a mean follow-up of 3 years, the incidence rates of delayed secondary interventions for aneurysm- or graft-related complications were 7% for HR patients and 10% for NR patients (P = .5). The 1-, 2-, and 4-year survival rates in HR patients (85%, 77%, 65%) were lower than those in NR patients (97%, 97%, 93%; P < .001), but this was more favorable compared with a 36% 4-year survival in the EVAR-2 trial. No difference was seen in long-term reintervention-free survival in HR and NR patients (P = .8). Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis identified five prognostic indicators for post-EVAR death: age, chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5, congestive heart failure, home oxygen use, and current cancer therapy.\nEVAR can be performed in patients unfit for open surgical repair with excellent early survival and long-term durability. These outcomes in the HR group compare more favorably to the EVAR-2 trial data. However, not all HR patients for open surgical repair derive the benefit from EVAR. The decision to proceed with EVAR in HR patients should be individualized, depending on the number and severity of risk factors.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the new Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification system correlates with important clinical outcomes for limb salvage and wound healing.\nA total of 201 consecutive patients with threatened limbs treated from 2010 to 2011 in an academic medical center were analyzed. These patients were stratified into clinical stages 1 to 4 on the basis of the SVS WIfI classification. The SVS objective performance goals of major amputation, 1-year amputation-free survival (AFS) rate, and wound healing time (WHT) according to WIfI clinical stages were compared.\nThe mean age was 58 years (79% male, 93% with diabetes). Forty-two patients required major amputation (21%); 159 (78%) had limb salvage. The amputation group had a significantly higher prevalence of advanced stage 4 patients (P < .001), whereas the limb salvage group presented predominantly as stages 1 to 3. Patients in clinical stages 3 and 4 had a significantly higher incidence of amputation (P < .001), decreased AFS (P < .001), and delayed WHT (P < .002) compared with those in stages 1 and 2. Among patients presenting with stage 3, primarily as a result of wound and ischemia grades, revascularization resulted in accelerated WHT (P = .008).\nThese data support the underlying concept of the SVS WIfI, that an appropriate classification system correlates with important clinical outcomes for limb salvage and wound healing. As the clinical stage progresses, the risk of major amputation increases, 1-year AFS declines, and WHT is prolonged. We further demonstrated benefit of revascularization to improve WHT in selected patients, especially those in stage 3. Future efforts are warranted to incorporate the SVS WIfI classification into clinical decision-making algorithms in conjunction with a comorbidity index and anatomic classification.",

    "abstract": "Whereas thermal ablation of incompetent saphenous veins is highly effective, all heat-based ablation techniques require the use of perivenous subfascial tumescent anesthesia, involving multiple needle punctures along the course of the target vein.

We report herein early results of a randomized trial of CAE vs radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of symptomatic incompetent GSVs.\nTwo hundred twenty-two subjects with symptomatic GSV incompetence were randomly assigned to receive either CAE (n = 108) with the VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System (Sapheon, Inc, Morrisville, NC) or RFA (n = 114) with the ClosureFast system (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass). After discharge, subjects returned to the clinic on day 3 and again at months 1 and 3. The study's primary end point was closure of the target vein at month 3 as assessed by duplex ultrasound and adjudicated by an independent vascular ultrasound core laboratory. Statistical testing focused on showing noninferiority with a 10% delta conditionally followed by superiority testing. No adjunctive procedures were allowed until after the month 3 visit, and missing month 3 data were imputed by various methods. Secondary end points included patient-reported pain during vein treatment and extent of ecchymosis at day 3. Additional assessments included general and disease-specific quality of life surveys and adverse event rates.\nAll subjects received the assigned intervention. By use of the predictive method for imputing missing data, 3-month closure rates were 99% for CAE and 96% for RFA. All primary end point analyses, which used various methods to account for the missing data rate (14%), showed evidence to support the study's noninferiority hypothesis (all P < .01); some of these analyses supported a trend toward superiority (P = .07 in the predictive model). Pain experienced during the procedure was mild and similar between treatment groups (2.2 and 2.4 for CAE and RFA, respectively, on a 10-point scale; P = .11). At day 3, less ecchymosis in the treated region was present after CAE compared with RFA (P < .01). Other adverse events occurred at a similar rate between groups and were generally mild and well tolerated.\nCAE was proven to be noninferior to RFA for the treatment of incompetent GSVs at month 3 after the procedure. Both treatment methods showed good safety profiles. CAE does not require tumescent anesthesia and is associated with less postprocedure ecchymosis.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the early and midterm to long-term experience of chimney grafts (CGs) in urgent endovascular repair of complex lesions in the thoracic aorta.\nTwenty-nine high-risk patients (20 men) who were unfit for open repair were treated using CG technique for ruptured (n = 14) or symptomatic (n = 15) aortic lesions engaging the aortic arch itself (n = 9), the descending aorta (n = 10), or the thoracoabdominal aorta (n = 10). Twenty-two patients (76%) were treated urgently (\u226424 hours) and seven were semiurgent (\u22643 days). Of 41 chimneys used, 24 were placed in supra-aortic branches and 17 in visceral branches. Median follow-up (interquartile range) for the entire cohort was 2 years (0.6-3.8 years), 2.5 years (1-4 years) for 30-day survivors, and 3.5 years (1.9-6.4 years) for those who were still alive.\nFour patients (14%) died \u226430 days of cerebral infarction (n = 1), visceral ischemia secondary to the initial rupture (n = 1), multiple organ failure (n = 1), or heart failure (n = 1). There were 11 late deaths (38%); however, only two deaths were related to the CG technique. The primary and secondary technical success rates were 86% (25 of 29) and 97% (28 of 29), respectively. The secondary patency rate of CGs was 98%. Seventeen (68%) of the aortic lesions shrank significantly. Three patients (10%) had primary type I endoleak and another three (10%) had secondary type I endoleak. The endoleaks were managed with Onyx (ev3 Endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, Minn) or coil embolization (n = 2), restenting (n = 1), and conversion to open repair (n = 2). One secondary endoleak is still under observation after >20 months. All primary endoleaks and one secondary endoleak originated from CGs in the brachiocephalic trunk (4 of 6 [67%]).\nThe midterm to long-term results of the CG technique for urgent and complex lesions of the thoracic aorta in high-risk patients are promising, with low early mortality and long durability of the CGs. More patients with longer follow-up are still needed.",

    "abstract": "Medical management (MM) with antiplatelet (AP) and statin therapy is recommended for most patients undergoing vascular surgery and has been advocated by the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). We analyzed the effect of VQI participation on perioperative (preoperative and postoperative) MM use over time and the effect of discharge MM on patient survival.\nWe studied VQI patients treated with MM preoperatively and at discharge from 2005 to 2014, including all elective carotid endarterectomy/carotid stenting (n = 28,092), suprainguinal/infrainguinal bypass (n = 11,362), peripheral vascular interventions (n = 24,476), open/endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 13,503), and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 702). We examined trends of MM use over time, as well as the effect of duration of VQI participation on MM use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with MM use. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with 5-year survival.\nMM with AP and statin preoperatively and postoperatively across VQI centers improved from 55% in 2005 to 68% in 2009, with a subsequent overall decline to 62% by 2014, coincident with many new centers with lower MM rates joining VQI in 2010. Longer center participation in VQI was associated with improved perioperative MM overall. This was also noted across all procedure types, with MM increasing from 47% to 82% for aneurysm repairs and 69% to 83% for carotid procedures from 1 to 12 years of participation in VQI. After multivariable adjustment, centers in VQI \u22653 years were 30% more likely to have patients on MM (odds ratio, 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.4). Importantly, discharge on AP and statin therapy was associated with improved 5-year survival, compared with discharge on neither medication (82% [95% CI, 81%-83%] vs 67% [95% CI, 62%-72%]), and an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5-0.7; P < .001). Discharge on a single medication was associated with intermediate survival at 5 years (AP only: 77% [95% CI, 75%-79%]; statin only: 73% [95% CI, 68%-77%]).\nThese data demonstrate that MM is associated with improved survival after a number of vascular procedures. Importantly, VQI participation improves the use of MM, demonstrating that involvement in an organized quality effort can affect patient outcomes.",

Each patient's clinical course was retrospectively reviewed, and patients were contacted for assessment of current symptoms.\nAll patients had computed tomography scans documenting a celiac artery dissection without concomitant aortic dissection. Ages ranged from 39 to 76 years. Seven patients presented with abdominal pain, and 12 were diagnosed incidentally. All patients were initially treated with observation because none had threatened end organs. Patients presenting with aspirin or clopidogrel therapy were continued on these medications, but no patients were prescribed any medications due to their dissection. Three patients continued to have abdominal pain and eventually underwent celiac artery stenting. Pain improved after the intervention in all three. One patient with aneurysmal degeneration of the celiac artery underwent surgical repair. No other patients required intervention. Eighteen patients had follow-up within a year of data collection in the clinic or over the phone. The average time from the initial diagnosis to follow-up for the entire cohort was 46 months. None had abdominal or back pain related to the celiac dissection, had lost weight, or had to change their eating habits.\nCeliac artery dissection can be safely managed initially with observation.

    "abstract": "Many surgeons favor routine shunting during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with recent stroke who otherwise prefer selective shunt placement for other indications of CEA. We analyzed the results of CEA in this group of patients with the strategy of selective shunting.\nA retrospective review was performed of 59 patients (group A) undergoing CEA \u22648 weeks of a stroke (2000-2014) from two midsized teaching hospitals with stroke certification; of these, 38 patients had CEA \u22642 weeks and 21 other had CEA >2 weeks but <8 weeks. All patients sustained a middle cerebral artery stroke with \u226570% ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. Cervical block anesthesia was used in 43 patients and general anesthesia in 16. During the same period, 1036 CEAs were performed for other indications (group B). All patients in group A were evaluated by stroke neurologist with a National Institutes of Health stroke scale score of 1 to 4 in 22 patients (minor stroke) and 5 to 15 in 37 patients (moderate stroke). A shunt was placed if neurologic changes (contralateral motor weakness, aphasia, loss of consciousness) occurred with the carotid cross-clamping or ischemic electroencephalogram changes under general anesthesia were observed.\nThe study population consisted of 59 patients (36 males and 23 females) in group A with mean age of 70.5 \u00b1 10.7 years. Carotid duplex imaging revealed contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis of <50% in 36 patients, 50% to 70% in 13, 71% to 99% in 9, and occlusion in 1. Ten patients (16.9%) required shunt placement, which was similar to the shunt in group B (11.8% for remote stroke, 10.2% for focal transient ischemic attack/monocular blindness, and 10.9% for asymptomatic carotid stenosis). Two patients in group A had perioperative stroke and died (3.4% stroke/mortality). There were no incidences of permanent cranial nerve palsy, myocardial infarction (MI), or hematoma requiring re-exploration in patients undergoing CEA in group A. Postoperative complications in group B included new neurologic deficits (postoperative stroke) in 16 (1.6%), MI in 2 (0.2%), permanent cranial nerve palsy in 3 (0.3%), and re-exploration for neck hematoma in 7 (0.7%).

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) of infrarenal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is increasingly used in patients with suitable aortic morphology conforming to device-specific instructions for use. Despite improvements in graft design, type II endoleak (EL-2) from the inferior mesenteric artery (EL-IMA) or the lumbar artery (EL-LA) remains the Achilles' heel of EVAR. The objective of this study was to evaluate the natural history of the AAA sac after EVAR. We hypothesized that persistent EL-2 would be associated with inferior AAA sac volume regression.\nA retrospective analysis was performed on all nonruptured AAA treated by elective EVAR using Food and Drug Administration-approved endografts from January 2005 to December 2008 in our facility. Review of medical records and preoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiograms at 1, 6, and 12 months was performed. Patients with type I, III, and IV endoleaks were excluded, as were those lost to all follow-up. AAA size and volume were analyzed using TeraRecon software (Aquarius Intuition, Foster City, Calif). Change in AAA sac volume was compared in patients with and without EL-2, and with an occluded vs patent IMA.\nThe study cohort comprised 191 patients (161 men, 30 women) with a mean age of 74 years. The mean preoperative AAA diameter was 5.5 cm (range, 4-11 cm), and mean volume was 137.45 cm(3). EL-2 was present in 24% at completion of EVAR and in 9% at a mean follow-up of 6 months (range 4-8 months). Completion angiography at 1 month showed 63% of EL-2 had resolved. Those with EL-2 present at 1 month had statistically inferior sac regression compared with those who did not (23% reduction vs 2% increase at 1 year; P = .002). Preoperatively, the IMA was occluded by coils or was chronically occluded in 82 patients vs 109 patients who had a patent IMA. At the 6-month follow-up, patients with an occluded IMA had an EL-2 rate of 2.4% vs 14.7% in those with a patent IMA (P = .005 by t-test). Sac volume regression was 21.8% in those with an occluded IMA vs 13.2% in those with a patent IMA (P = .004 by t-test). Regression in AAA sac volume was highly significant in patients with occluded IMA, at 30% vs 16% at 1 year (P = .0018 by two-sided t-test).\nThe presence of persistent EL-2 after EVAR results in inferior AAA sac regression. A preoperatively patent IMA is associated with increased rates of EL-2 and inferior AAA sac regression. Consideration should be given to preoperative occlusion of a patent IMA before EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs (EVARs) with fenestrated (FEVAR) stent grafts are high radiation dose cases, yet no skin injuries were found retrospectively in our 61 cases with a mean peak skin dose (PSD) of 6.8 Gy. We hypothesize that skin injury is under-reported. This study examined deterministic effects in FEVARs after procedural changes implemented to detect skin injury.\nAll FEVARs during a 6-month period with a radiation dose of 5 Gy reference air kerma (RAK; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements threshold for substantial radiation dose level [SRDL]) were included. Patients were questioned about skin erythema, epilation, and necrosis, with a physical examination of the back completed daily until discharge and then at 2 and 4 weeks and at 3 and 6 months. PSD distributions were calculated with custom software using input data from fluoroscopic machine logs. These calculations have been validated against Gafchromic (Ashland Inc, Covington, Ky) film measurements. Dose was summed for the subset of patients with multiple procedures \u22646 months of the SRDL event, consistent with the joint commission recommendations.\nTwenty-two patients, 21 FEVARs and one embolization, reached an RAK of 5 Gy. The embolization procedure was excluded from review. The average RAK was 7.6 \u00b1 2.0 Gy (range, 5.1-11.4 Gy), with a mean PSD of 4.8 \u00b1 2.0 Gy (range, 2.3-10.4 Gy). Fifty-two percent of patients had multiple endovascular procedures \u22646 months of the SRDL event. The mean RAK for this subset was 10.0 \u00b1 2.9 Gy (range, 5.5-15.1 Gy), with a mean PSD of 6.6 \u00b1 1.9 Gy (range, 3.4-9.4 Gy). One patient died before the first postoperative visit. No radiation skin injuries were found. Putative risk factors for skin injury were evaluated and included smoking (32%), diabetes (14%), cytotoxic drugs (9%), and fair skin type (91%). No other risk factors were present (hyperthyroidism, collagen vascular disorders).\nDeterministic skin injuries are uncommon after FEVAR, even at high RAK levels, regardless of cumulative dose effects. This study addresses the concern of missed injuries based on the retrospective clinical examination findings that were published in our previous work. Even with more comprehensive postoperative skin examinations and patient questioning, the fact that no skin injuries were found suggests that radiation-induced skin injuries are multifactorial and not solely dose dependent.",

Centerlines for the aorta and visceral vessels were extracted from three-dimensional models. Branch angles were computed relative to the orthogonal plane at the branch ostia, and end-stent angles of the left renal artery (LRA) and right renal artery (RRA) were computed relative to the distal stent orientation. The radius of peak curvature was defined by the circumscribed circle at the highest curvature.\nSn-renal branches were more downward-angled than F-renal branches (P < .04). At the distal ends of the RRA stents, Sn-RRAs were angled greater than F-RRAs (P < .03) and had a smaller radius of peak curvature (P < .03). With expiration, the end-stent angle of Sn-LRAs increased by 4\u00b0 \u00b1 4\u00b0 (P < .02) and exhibited a significant reduction of radius of curvature (P < .04). The unstented celiac arteries were more downward-angled (P < .02, inspiration), with a smaller radius of curvature (P < .00001), than the unstented superior mesenteric arteries. With expiration, the celiac arteries angled upwards by 9\u00b0 \u00b1 9\u00b0 (P < .0005), which was greater than the superior mesenteric arteries (P < .03). At a median postoperative follow-up of 12.6 months (range, 1.0-37.1 months), branch vessel patency was 100%, serum creatinine levels remained stable, and one reintervention was required for a type III endoleak at the main body-LRA stent interface.\nSn-renals were angled more inferiorly at the branch and more angulated at the stent end than F-renals due to stent placement strategies. Sn-LRAs exhibited a significant change in end-stent angle and curvature during respiration, a finding that may compromise long-term durability for parallel stent graft configurations. Further investigation is warranted to better optimize anatomic, patient, and branch vessel stent selection between fenestrated and snorkel strategies and their relationship to long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated and branched endografts allow for proximal sealing zone extension into or above the visceral aorta to optimize landing in healthy aorta. We describe the incidence, causes, and implications of proximal endoleak development in patients undergoing complex endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.\nAll patients undergoing a fenestrated/branched repair were entered onto a prospective database, and this analysis included all those with at least one postoperative contrast computed tomography scan. Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional imaging was reanalyzed to characterize morphology and identify endoleak. A blinded assessor used the preoperative imaging to resize the repairs in the endoleak group and a matched cohort of patients without endoleak. The outcome measures were proximal endoleak development, mortality, and component stability, and a comparison was made with all patients undergoing complex aortic repair.\nFrom 2001 to July 2013, 969 patients underwent repair in a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption trial. Excluded were 24 emergency patients and 21 patients without requisite imaging, leaving 924 available for analysis. A proximal type Ia endoleak developed in 26 patients (2.8%). Poor choice of landing zone was implicated in most cases, with an area of sealing in the visceral aorta, compared with the thoracic aorta, being significantly associated with endoleak development (P\u00a0< .01). Aortic-related mortality was significantly higher in the endoleak group (26.9%) than in the group without endoleak (6.2%; P\u00a0= .001). These patients also experienced a higher incidence of component instability of 30.8% compared with 9.6% in patients without type Ia endoleak (P\u00a0< .01).\nFenestrated/branched endovascular repair has a low incidence of sealing zone failure despite the increased complexity. However, development of a proximal endoleak destabilizes the repair and leads to increased mortality. Increasing complexity of design seems to improve the long-term outcome for patients requiring complex aortic repair.",

These patients also experienced a higher incidence of component instability of 30.8% compared with 9.6% in patients without type Ia endoleak (P\u00a0< .01).",

    "abstract": "The introduction of carotid stenting has led to a rapid rise in the number of vascular specialists performing this procedure. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST) has shown that carotid stenting can be performed with an equivalent major event rate compared with carotid endarterectomy. However, there is still controversy about the appropriate training and experience required to safely perform this procedure. This observational study examined the performance of carotid stenting with regard to specialty and case volume.\nFrom 2004 to 2011, inpatients diagnosed with carotid stenosis who had a carotid stenting procedure were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. The cohort was separated on the basis of the provider performing the procedure (surgeon vs interventionalist), hospital location, and volume. Surgeons were defined as providers who also performed either a carotid endarterectomy or femoral-popliteal bypass during the same time interval. Primary end points analyzed included stroke, myocardial infarction, and 30-day mortality. Length of stay and hospital costs were also analyzed as secondary outcomes.\nA total of 20,663 cases of carotid stenting were found; 15,305 (74%) cases were identified to be performed by a \"surgeon,\" whereas 5358 (26%) were done by an \"interventionalist.\" The majority of cases were done at hospitals in urban locations (96.51%) and designated teaching institutions (61.47%). Unadjusted outcomes were similar between surgeons and interventionalists in terms of stroke (4.33% and 4.41%), myocardial infarction (2.10% and 2.13%), and mortality (0.84% and 1.03%) respectively. Qualitatively, volume per 10 cases was shown to decrease the risk of stroke. Adjusted multivariate analysis demonstrated no statistical significance between primary end point outcomes. However, length of stay (2.81 vs 3.08\u00a0days) and total charges ($48,087.61 and $51,718.77) were lower for procedures performed by surgeons.\nSurgeons are performing the majority of carotid stent procedures in the United States. The volume of cases performed by a provider, rather than the provider's specialty, appears to be a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes for carotid stenting. There were, however, significant cost differences between surgeons and interventionalists, which needs to be further evaluated at an institutional level.",

    "abstract": "Blood transfusions are common among patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Prior studies suggest an association between blood transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The predictors of perioperative transfusion and its impact on patients undergoing vascular surgery have been poorly defined.\nWe examined data from a large multicenter quality improvement vascular surgical registry of all patients undergoing elective or urgent open peripheral arterial disease procedures, endovascular aneurysm repair, or open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair between January 2012 and December 2013. Emergency cases, carotid endarterectomy, and carotid artery stenting were excluded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify predictors of transfusion and association of transfusion with outcomes. All regression models had Hosmer-Lemeshow P > .05 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of >0.8, confirming excellent goodness of fit and discrimination.\nOur study population comprised 2946 patients who underwent open peripheral arterial disease procedures (n\u00a0= 1744), open AAA repair (n\u00a0= 175), or endovascular aneurysm repair (n\u00a0= 1027) at 22 hospitals. The overall transfusion rate was 25%, at a median nadir hemoglobin level of 7.7\u00a0g/dL. Independent factors predicting transfusion included female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.2), nonwhite race (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.2), preoperative admission status (ie, acute care hospital) (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.3), preoperative anemia (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 3.3-5.1), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9), prior myocardial infarction (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.01-1.6), clopidogrel (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8), open AAA repair (OR, 25; 95% CI, 17-39), open bypass (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.7-4.6), and urgent procedures (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8). With adjustment for major covariates, perioperative transfusion was independently associated with death (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.2-15), myocardial infarction (OR, 8; 95% CI, 3.7-17), and pneumonia (OR, 7.4; 95% CI, 3.3-17).\nPerioperative transfusion in vascular surgical patients is independently associated with increased 30-day morbidity and mortality. Given indeterminate causation, these data suggest the need for a prospective transfusion threshold study in vascular surgical patients.",

    "abstract": "Women have been under-represented in trials that set guidelines for the management of aortic aneurysms. Several studies reported inferior outcomes in women compared with men after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We investigated the relationship between gender and outcomes after EVAR.\nA total of 1380 consecutive patients underwent elective EVAR from 1992 to 2012. Baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative variables by gender were analyzed from a prospective database.\nThe cohort comprised 214 women (15.5%) and 1166 men (84.5%). Women were older than men at repair (77.8 vs 74.5 years, P < .001) and had less cardiac disease (P = .005). They had shorter (19.8 \u00b1 12.9 vs 26.3 \u00b1 14.7 mm; P < .001) more angulated aortic necks (38.8\u00b0 \u00b1 16.1\u00b0 vs 31.2\u00b0 \u00b1 14.7\u00b0; P < .001) and fewer iliac aneurysms (P = .002). Women had more arterial reconstructions (iliac conduits, P = .006; thrombolysis and thrombectomy, P = .013; patch angioplasty, P < .001; endarterectomy, P < .001), more perioperative complications (16.9% vs 9.1%; P = .001), and more in-hospital days (4.1 vs 3.4 days; P = .029). Perioperative mortality was equivalent (women: 2% vs men: 2.3%; P = .73). Mean follow-up was 30.9 months. Women and men experienced equivalent aneurysm-related deaths and overall survival. Survival curve analysis showed endoleaks were more likely to develop in women than men (P = .005); however, there was no difference in rates of arterial reinterventions required for each gender during the follow-up period.\nFemale gender is associated with more periprocedural complications, adjunctive arterial procedures, and increased endoleaks but does not affect long-term reinterventions or survival. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the effect of gender on outcomes. These data should be considered when selecting EVAR for men and women.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure remains a significant problem with reported early failure rates around 50%. Suboptimal hemodynamics, variable surgical skills, and technique dependency are widely believed to contribute to AVF nonmaturation. The Optiflow (Bioconnect Systems, Ambler, Pa) is a novel anastomotic device placed in situ that has potential for improving hemodynamics and standardizing AVF placement. We report results from a prospective nonrandomized controlled pilot study designed to investigate the safety and performance of the Optiflow.\nForty-one participants underwent AVF formation using either a 3-mm or 4-mm Optiflow and 39 matched control participants underwent AVF formation using the standard technique at two sites. Patients were observed for 90 days after AVF placement. The primary end point was unassisted maturation, which was defined as an outflow vein with a diameter \u22655 mm and blood flow \u2265500 mL/min measured by Doppler ultrasound. The secondary performance end point was unassisted patency, and the primary safety end point was freedom from device-related serious adverse events.\nUnassisted maturation rates at 14, 42, and 90 days were 76%, 72%, and 68%, respectively, for the Optiflow group and 67%, 68%, and 76%, respectively, in the control group (P = .38, .69, and .47 at 14, 42, and 90 days). There was a trend to earlier maturation (assessed at 14 days) in the 4-mm Optiflow group compared with the control group (P = .059). There were no device-related serious adverse events.\nMaturation results for both the Optiflow and control groups were highly favorable compared with historical assisted maturation rates of approximately 50%. The Optiflow appears to be safe and effective in the placement of AVFs, with high maturation rates.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to study associations between clinical variables, demographic factors, and outcome after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nData of consecutive patients who underwent EVAR between 1997 and 2011 at a tertiary center were analyzed. Comorbidity scores stratified patients into low/normal-risk (score \u2264 10) or high-risk categories (score > 10). The primary end point was mortality; secondary end points were morbidities, reinterventions, conversions, and ruptures.\nThe study included 934 patients, 117 women (13%) and 817 men (87%) (mean age, 76 \u00b1 7.3 years; range, 51-99 years). There were 870 (93%) asymptomatic, 36 (3.9%) symptomatic, and 28 (3.0%) ruptured AAAs. The 30-day mortality was 1.4% (13 of 934), 1.0% (9 of 870) for asymptomatic patients, 2.8% (1 of 36) for patients with symptomatic AAAs, and 11% (3 of 28) for patients with ruptured AAAs (P = .004). Clinical presentation with symptoms or rupture was associated with more complications (P = .02), reinterventions (P = .003), and a lower 5-year survival (P = .04). Association between surgical risk, female gender, age, and outcome was studied in 870 asymptomatic patients. Both 30-day mortality and complication rates were higher for high-risk vs low/normal-risk patients (2.3% vs 0.2%, P = .003; 15% vs 10%, P = .04); reintervention rates were equivalent (3.8% vs 4.4%; P = .67). The 30-day mortality and complication rates were similar in women and men (2.8% vs 0.8%, P = .09; 17% vs 11%, P = .11), but reintervention rate was higher in women (8.5% vs 3.5%; P = .02). Follow-up averaged 3.8 years (1 month-13.5 years). In asymptomatic patients, 5-year survival was 74% for low/normal-risk patients and 54% for high-risk patients (P < .001); both had similar rates of freedom from complications (65% vs 63%; P = .24), reinterventions (71% vs 75%; P = .36), or rupture (99.3% vs 99.7%; P = .42). Women had more complications (47% vs 34%; P = .04) and reinterventions than men did (39% vs 26%; P = .02); freedom from rupture was the same (100% vs 99.3%; P = .30). There were eight ruptures, all in asymptomatic patients. In multivariate analysis, high surgical risk and age were associated with all-cause mortality (P < .001); female gender was associated with complications and reinterventions (P < .05) but not mortality.\nClinical presentation predicts early mortality and complications, age predicts both early and late mortalities after EVAR. Although women had an increased rate of complications and reinterventions, women did not have significantly higher mortality than men.",

Early experience was defined as the first 50 patients treated at each center. Data from early and late experience were retrospectively analyzed and compared for differences in operative results and 1-year outcomes.\nEarly experience covered 4.7 years in Malm\u00f6 and 4.5 years in Lille; late experience covered 5.6 years in Malm\u00f6 and 3.7 years in Lille. A total of 288 patients were included. In the later phase, stent graft configuration was more complex because of increased number of fenestrations/scallops incorporated in the graft design (2.7 \u00b1 0.8 vs 3.2 \u00b1 0.7; P < .001). Despite this, volume of contrast material and radiation time decreased by 27% and 20%, respectively, whereas procedure time remained unchanged. At 1 year, a trend toward decreasing abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter was observed in the late group, but no differences were found in mortality, endoleaks, or target vessel patency between the groups.\nWith increasing experience, fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair design has become more complicated, with more visceral vessels targeted for better proximal seal, while operative risk still remains low. Simultaneously, radiation time and volume of contrast material have been reduced, with possible long-term benefits for the patient.",

Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT), followed by a split-thickness skin graft (STSG), can be a cost-effective alternative to this standard care. We performed a cost analysis of these two treatments.\nA retrospective review was performed of 10 ulcers treated with surgical debridement, 7 days of inpatient NPWT with topical antiseptic instillation (NPWTi), and STSG, with 4 additional days of inpatient NPWT bolster over the graft. Independent medical cost estimators were used to compare the cost of this treatment protocol with standard outpatient compression therapy.\nThe average length of time ulcers were present before patients entered the study was 38 months (range, 3-120 months). Eight of 10 patients had complete VLU closure by 6 months after NPWTi with STSG. The 6-month costs of the proposed treatment protocol and standard twice-weekly compression therapy were estimated to be $27,000 and $28,000, respectively.\nNPWTi with STSG treatment is more effective for closure of massive VLUs at 6 months than that reported for standard compression therapy. Further, the cost of the proposed treatment protocol is comparable with standard compression therapy.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients with tissue loss have been recognized to have a poor survival rate. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the prognosis of CLI patients with tissue loss improves after complete wound healing is achieved by endovascular therapy.\nWe treated 187 CLI patients with tissue loss by endovascular therapy from April 2007 to December 2012. Among these patients, 113 patients who achieved complete wound healing were enrolled. The primary end point was survival rate at 3 years. The secondary end points were limb salvage rate and recurrence rate of CLI at 3 years.\nThe mean follow-up period after achievement of complete wound healing was 32 \u00b1 18 months. At 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, the survival rates were 86%, 79%, and 74%; the limb salvage rates were 100%, 100%, and 100%; the recurrence rates of CLI were 2%, 6%, and 9%, respectively. On multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, age >75 years (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-8.24; P = .017) and nonambulatory status (hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.65; P = .035) were identified as independent predictors of death for CLI patients with tissue loss even after complete wound healing was achieved. The Kaplan-Meier curve for the overall survival rate at 3 years showed that CLI patients of older age (>75 years) had a significantly decreased survival rate compared with CLI patients of younger age (\u226475 years) (58% vs 87%; log-rank test, P < .001). In addition, nonambulatory CLI patients had a significantly poor survival rate relative to ambulatory CLI patients (40% vs 93%; log-rank test, P < .001).\nThe overall survival rate of CLI patients was acceptable and the recurrence rate of CLI was extremely low once complete wound healing was achieved. Nonambulatory status and age >75 years can serve as predictors of death even after complete wound healing is achieved.",

On multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, age >75 years (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-8.24; P = .017) and nonambulatory status (hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.65; P = .035) were identified as independent predictors of death for CLI patients with tissue loss even after complete wound healing was achieved. The Kaplan-Meier curve for the overall survival rate at 3 years showed that CLI patients of older age (>75 years) had a significantly decreased survival rate compared with CLI patients of younger age (\u226475 years) (58% vs 87%; log-rank test, P < .001). In addition, nonambulatory CLI patients had a significantly poor survival rate relative to ambulatory CLI patients (40% vs 93%; log-rank test, P < .001).",

    "abstract": "Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare, with little known about their natural history and growth rate or their optimal management. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) define the clinical features of RAAs, including the precise growth rate and risk of rupture, (2) examine the current management and outcomes of RAA treatment using existing guidelines, and (3) examine the appropriateness of current criteria for repair of asymptomatic RAAs.\nA standardized, multi-institutional approach was used to evaluate patients with RAAs at institutions from all regions of the United States. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, aneurysm imaging, conservative and operative management, postoperative complications, and follow-up data were collected.\nA total of 865 RAAs in 760 patients were identified at 16 institutions. Of these, 75% were asymptomatic; symptomatic patients had difficult-to-control hypertension (10%), flank pain (6%), hematuria (4%), and abdominal pain (2%). The RAAs had a mean maximum diameter of 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 cm. Most were unilateral (96%), on the right side (61%), saccular (87%), and calcified (56%). Elective repair was performed in 213 patients with 241 RAAs, usually for symptoms or size >2 cm; the remaining 547 patients with 624 RAAs were observed. Major operative complications occurred in 10%, including multisystem organ failure, myocardial infarction, and renal failure requiring dialysis. RAA repair for difficult-to-control hypertension cured 32% of patients and improved it in 26%. Three patients had ruptured RAA; all were transferred from other hospitals and underwent emergency repair, with no deaths. Conservatively treated patients were monitored for a mean of 49 months, with no acute complications. Aneurysm growth rate was 0.086 cm/y, with no difference between calcified and noncalcified aneurysms.\nThis large, contemporary, multi-institutional study demonstrated that asymptomatic RAAs rarely rupture (even when >2 cm), growth rate is 0.086 \u00b1 0.08 cm/y, and calcification does not protect against enlargement. RAA open repair is associated with significant minor morbidity, but rarely a major morbidity or mortality. Aneurysm repair cured or improved hypertension in >50% of patients whose RAA was identified during the workup for difficult-to-control hypertension.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review a single-institution contemporary experience with embolization treatment of pseudoaneurysms (PAs) from the external carotid artery (ECA).\nFrom December 2000 to June 2014, PAs in the head and neck of 17 patients underwent embolization treatment and were retrospectively evaluated. All were treated with obliteration of the feeding artery or the PA by detachable coils or fibered coils, or both. Clinical follow-up was a mean of 91.9 months (range, 4-173 months) and was performed for all patients. Therapeutic outcomes were determined by evaluating the postprocedural image and clinical outcome of symptoms and signs.\nThe 17 consecutive patients with head and neck PAs who underwent coils embolization treatment consisted of 14 male patients (82.3%) and three female patients (17.7%). The average age was 37.5 years (range, 16-57 years). The most common symptom and sign was a pulsatile mass, seen in 15 of 17 patients, and other symptoms included pain (three patients) or bleeding (four patients). Digital substraction angiography revealed that the PAs originated from the ECA in 3 patients and others originated from the branches of the ECA, including the superficial temporal artery in 6 patients, internal maxillary artery in 4, superior thyroid artery in 2, and the facial artery and posterior auricular artery in 1. Seventeen coils embolizations for occlusion of the parent artery were performed in 14 patients with a transarterial approach and in three by direct percutaneous puncture. All patients remained symptom free, and no procedure-related complications occurred.\nEmbolization treatment of PAs from the ECA is a useful alternative to standard surgical repair. This modality avoids the necessity for surgical exposure of the face and of the neck with its inherent morbidity.",

    "abstract": "The clinical dilemma in suspected aortic graft infection (AGI) is how to noninvasively obtain a reliable proof of infection. In addition to confirming the presence of infection, obtaining information regarding the extent of infection to select a proper strategy for reoperation is also necessary. Therefore, developing a more reliable noninvasive physiologic approach to detect infected prostheses is required. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning ((18)F-FDG PET) has been suggested to have a pivotal role in the detection of AGI. In this study, we assessed the contribution of two (semi) quantitative parameters-maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and tissue-to-background ratio (TBR)-and of two visual parameters-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) distribution patterns and visual grading scale-in the final confirmation of the diagnosis of AGI.\nPatients with a central aortic prosthetic graft and symptoms clinically suggestive of AGI were gathered from a prospectively maintained database. Included were those who underwent (18)F-FDG PET scanning combined with computed tomography angiography and in whom periprosthetic samples were taken at some stage in the diagnostic process. AGI was considered proven in case of a positive culture and compared with a group with negative cultures. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated. Receiver operating characteristics curves were used to assess the ability of SUVmax and TBR to identify the presence and absence of AGI (ie, accuracy).\nIn 37 of 77 patients with suspected AGI, (18)FDG-PET and perigraft material for culturing was obtained. The tissue culture was positive in 21 of these 37 patients (56.7%). Mean \u00b1 standard deviation SUVmax for proven infection was 8.1 \u00b1 3.7 (range, 3.6-18.5) and TBR was 5.9 \u00b1 2.7 (range, 1.7-13.0). The area under the curve for SUVmax was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.93). A cutoff value of 8 yielded a PPV of 80% and a NPV of 54%. The area under the curve for TBR was 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.87). A cutoff value of 6 yielded a PPV of 73% and NPV of 52%. The PPVs for the visual grading scale and (18)F-FDG distribution patterns were 75% and 61%, respectively; the NPVs were 77% and 67%, respectively.\nOur study, performed in a small sample of patients suspected of AGI, showed that the diagnostic abilities of quantitative and visual (18)F-FDG PET parameters are modest.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia has been proposed as a prognostic factor for various diseases. Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) have a very poor prognosis, but sarcopenia has not been reported as a prognostic factor for CLI patients. If sarcopenia is associated with the prognosis of CLI patients, it could help select the treatment plan. Therefore, we examined whether sarcopenia is a prognostic factor for CLI patients.\nWe performed a retrospective study of CLI patients diagnosed with Fontaine III or IV peripheral artery disease who underwent preoperative computed tomography imaging and revascularization between January 2002 and December 2009. The presence of sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle area of <114.0 cm(2) for men or <89.8 cm(2) for women using transverse computed tomography scans at the third lumbar vertebra. We compared the 5-year survival rate and clinical characteristics between patients with or without sarcopenia. We also screened possible prognostic factors for overall survival using hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nOf 64 eligible patients, 28 patients had sarcopenia and 36 did not. There were significant differences in age, skeletal muscle area, body mass index, and the presence of smoking, cerebrovascular disease, and hemodialysis between patients with and without sarcopenia (all P < .05). The 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients with sarcopenia (23.5% vs 77.5%, P = .001). Prognostic factors for overall survival were the presence of sarcopenia (HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.24-9.11; P = .02), requirement for hemodialysis (HR, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.60-12.2; P = .004), and postoperative complications (HR, 5.02; 95% CI, 1.90-13.7; P = .001).\nOur results suggest that sarcopenia is a prognostic factor for CLI patients. Exercise and nutritional interventions focusing on improving sarcopenia might be useful treatment options for CLI patients.",

    "abstract": "Circulating anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I (ABGPI) antibodies are associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and induce the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells. Our aim is to study a transcriptional activation pathway of the innate immune system through the cellular signalling cascade triggered by receptors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of endothelial cells after the exposure of these cells to seropositive ABGPI human serum obtained from PAD patients.\nWe obtained serum samples from PAD patients and controls without PAD. ABGPI serum titer was detected using indirect immunofluorescence. Our sample was stratified into three groups: group I (PAD and ABGPI titer \u22651:100; n = 15), group II (PAD and ABGPI titer <1:100; n = 15), and control participants (no PAD; n = 15). All serum samples were incubated with human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) culture. Genomic expression of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors and their shared intracellular signalling molecules, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase (1IRAK1), were measured after the exposure of HAECs to each serum.\nHAEC genomic expression of TLR4 was higher after the exposure to group I serum than after the exposure to group II serum (log10\u00d710-relative quantification [RQ]: 1.80 \u00b1 0.42 vs 1.37 \u00b1 0.39; P = .01) or control serum (log10\u00d710-RQ: 1.80 \u00b1 0.42 vs 1.09 \u00b1 0.26; P < .01). TLR4 expression was higher in group II than in the control group (log10\u00d710-RQ: 1.37 \u00b1 0.39 vs 1.09 \u00b1 0.26; P = .04). TLR4 expression correlated with MyD88 (r = 0.54; P < .01) and IRAK1 (r = 0.55; P < .01) expression. We recorded a positive correlation between MyD88 and IRAK1 genomic expression (r = 0.58; P < .01).\nOur results suggest that serum from PAD patients with elevated ABGPI antibodies induces a genomic overexpression of TLR4 and its cellular signalling molecules in endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) contributes to the failure of vascular interventions. While many investigational therapies inhibit the development of IH in animal models, few of these potential therapies can reverse established lesions. Inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) dramatically inhibits IH in both rats and pigs when given perioperatively. It also prevented the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in rodents. Interestingly, CO could reverse pulmonary artery structural changes and right heart hemodynamic changes when administered after the establishment of pulmonary hypertension. Thus, we hypothesize that inhaled CO may mediate the regression of established neointimal lesions.\nRats underwent carotid artery balloon angioplasty injury. Carotid arteries were collected at 2 and 4 weeks after injury for morphometric analysis of the neointima. Another group was treated with inhaled CO (250 parts per million) for 1 hour daily from week 2 until week 4. Additional rats were sacrificed 3 days after initiating CO treatment, and the carotid arteries were examined for apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling, proliferation by Ki67 staining, and autophagy by microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 I/II staining.\nAt 2 weeks following injury, sizable neointimal lesions had developed (intimal/media = 0.92 \u00b1 0.22). By 4 weeks, lesion size remained stable (0.80 \u00b1 0.09). Delayed inhaled CO treatment greatly reduced neointimal lesion size vs the 2- and 4-week control mice (0.38 \u00b1 0.05; P < .05). Arteries from the CO-treated rats exhibited significantly reduced apoptosis compared with control vessels (3.18% \u00b1 1.94% vs 16.26% \u00b1 5.91%; P = .036). Proliferation was also dramatically reduced in the CO-treated animals (2.98 \u00b1 1.55 vs 10.37 \u00b1 2.80; P = .036). No difference in autophagy between control and CO-treated rats was detected.\nDelayed administration of inhaled CO reduced established neointimal lesion size. This effect was mediated by the antiproliferative effect of CO on medial and intimal smooth muscle cells without increases in arterial wall apoptosis or autophagy. Future studies will examine additional time points to determine if there is temporal variation in the rates of apoptosis and autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Aortic wall thickness (AWT) is important for anatomic description and biomechanical modeling of aneurysmal disease. However, no validated, noninvasive method for measuring AWT exists. We hypothesized that semiautomated image segmentation algorithms applied to computed tomography angiography (CTA) can accurately measure AWT.\nAortic samples from 10 patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair were taken from sites of the proximal or distal anastomosis, or both, yielding 13 samples. Aortic specimens were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. After staining with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome, sections were digitally scanned and measured. Patients' preoperative CTA Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM; National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Rosslyn, Va) images were segmented into luminal, inner arterial, and outer arterial surfaces with custom algorithms using active contours, isoline contour detection, and texture analysis. AWT values derived from image data were compared with measurements of corresponding pathologic specimens.\nAWT determined by CTA averaged 2.33 \u00b1 0.66 mm (range, 1.52-3.55 mm), and the AWT of pathologic specimens averaged 2.36 \u00b1 0.75 mm (range, 1.51-4.16 mm). The percentage difference between pathologic specimens and CTA-determined AWT was 9.5% \u00b1 4.1% (range, 1.8%-16.7%). The correlation between image-based measurements and pathologic measurements was high (R = 0.935). The 95% limits of agreement computed by Bland-Altman analysis fell within the range of -0.42 and 0.42 mm.\nSemiautomated analysis of CTA images can be used to accurately measure regional and patient-specific AWT, as validated using pathologic ex vivo human aortic specimens. Descriptions and reconstructions of aortic aneurysms that incorporate locally resolved wall thickness are feasible and may improve future attempts at biomechanical analyses.",

    "abstract": "Whereas carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the \"gold standard\" treatment, given its low complication rate, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a valid alternative in patients with prohibitive surgical risks. However, the application of CAS has been scrutinized, given its increased perioperative risk in comparison to CEA. Operators follow general guidelines in intraoperative techniques in CAS. However, few of those are evidence based. We believe that a specific outcome-driven examination of the effect of pre- and poststent deployment ballooning is warranted. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of prestent ballooning (pre-SB) and poststent ballooning (post-SB) on hemodynamic depression (HD) and perioperative stroke or death.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who had CAS between 2005 and 2014 in the Vascular Quality Initiative database. Logistic regression analyses of the effect of different pre-SB and post-SB combinations on HD and the 30-day stroke and death rate were performed. We excluded patients who had no protection device, those with isolated common carotid artery lesions, and those who had no ballooning at all. The models controlled for patient age, gender, comorbidities, smoking status, symptomatic status, history of previous ipsilateral CEA, preoperative medications, and ipsilateral degree of stenosis.\nA total of 3772 patients who underwent CAS were included for analysis. Average age of patients was 69.8 \u00b1 9.6 years, with 63% being male. The overall perioperative stroke and death rate was 3.0%. Compared with pre-SB only technique, the combined pre-SB and post-SB technique had a 2.1-fold increase in HD (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-3.01; P < .001) and 2.4-fold increase in perioperative stroke and death rate (odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-5.62; P < .050).\nCompared with pre-SB alone, the use of post-SB increases the chances of perioperative HD and stroke and death rate in patients undergoing CAS. Post-SB should be used only in those cases with severe residual stenosis.",

    "abstract": "We present a case report of simultaneous pulmonary emboli and paradoxical embolism to the cerebellum causing a stroke and severe ischemia to the left leg. This patient had risk factors for thromboembolic events that included autoimmune disease, cancer, and recent pelvic surgery. The presence of a perforate foramen ovale was suspected on his initial presentation and confirmed with echocardiography. For acute leg ischemia, this patient underwent emergent left common femoral embolectomy. The potential benefit of immediate anticoagulation had to be weighed against the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of his cerebellar stroke with possible compression of the fourth ventricle. In the end, full anticoagulation was delayed with interval placement of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter. This case illustrates the challenges faced in treating a patient with multiple paradoxical emboli.",

    "abstract": "In 2009, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) established objective performance goals (OPG) for lower extremity bypass (LEB) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) based on pooled data from previously performed prospective studies in an effort to provide a benchmark and historical control for future trials. However, patients with a prosthetic conduit and end-stage renal disease were excluded from this cohort. In contemporary practice, many patients do not meet the criteria for SVS OPG inclusion, making generalization of the SVS OPG difficult. The goal of this study was to establish safety and efficacy measures for patients who were excluded from the original SVS OPG analysis.\nAll patients who underwent LEB for CLI in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) from 2003 to 2013 were identified. Patients were stratified into OPG-eligible and non-OPG-eligible cohorts. Outcomes included 30-day major adverse limb events, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events, 1-year survival, and 1-year freedom from amputation. The SVS OPG methodology was used to create new performance goals for the non-OPG-eligible patients.\nWe identified 3609 patients: 2360 OPG (65%) vs 1249 non-OPG (35%), and overall results were stratified as a function of OPG status. The 30-day major adverse limb event rate was 5.0% (5.5% non-OPG vs 4.4% OPG; P = .34), and the 30-day major adverse cardiovascular event rate was 7.3% (9.2% non-OPG vs 6.2% OPG; P = .001). At 1 year, survival was 84% (75.9% non-OPG vs 88.3% OPG; P < .001), and freedom from amputation was 86.9% (80.9% non-OPG vs 90.1% OPG; P < .001).\nThe SVS OPG were attainable in New England for the population of patients who would have met SVS OPG study cohort inclusion criteria. However, 35% of the patients who underwent LEB for CLI in the last 10 years fell outside of these criteria by having end-stage renal disease or requiring a prosthetic conduit. We therefore suggest new benchmarks for these high-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Complex aortic aneurysms are now being repaired by endovascular techniques, albeit with a potentially increased risk of lower limb ischemia-reperfusion injury. We report a simple technique to maintain perfusion to the lower limb during endovascular repair, using one additional introducer sheath placed antegrade, distal to the stent graft introduction site, and connected to the side arm of the working sheath in the contralateral artery. This allows continuous perfusion of the limb distal to the main stent graft introduction site. In our initial experience with 12 cases, with confirmed occlusion of the native arterial system by the stent graft introducer sheath, arterial occlusion time was 165 \u00b1 84 minutes. Use of the sheath-shunt technique resulted in pulsatile flow in all cases, with an average flow of 42.2 \u00b1 13.2 mL/min, and actual ischemia time was reduced to 14 \u00b1 11 minutes. There were no complications related to the use of this technique. Given the limited risk of this technique coupled with a potential benefit, we propose its consideration in patients undergoing complex endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported on the role of postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with varying results. Most of these studies had a small sample size or did not analyze cost-effectiveness.\nWe analyzed 489 of 501 CEA patients with patch closure. All patients had immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound examination and were routinely followed up both clinically and with duplex ultrasound at regular intervals of 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the rate of \u226550% and \u226580% post-CEA restenosis over time and the time frame of progression from normal to \u226550% or \u226580% restenosis. The cost of post-CEA duplex surveillance was also estimated.\nOverall, 489 patients with a mean age of 68.5 years were analyzed. Ten of these had residual postoperative \u226550% stenosis, and 37 did not undergo a second duplex ultrasound examination and therefore were not included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 1-63 months), with a mean number of duplex ultrasound examinations of 3.6 (range, 1-7). Eleven of 397 patients (2.8%) with a normal finding on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound vs 4 of 45 (8.9%) with mild stenosis on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound progressed to \u226550% restenosis (P = .055). Overall, 15 patients (3.1%) had \u226550% restenosis, 9 with 50% to <80% and 4 with 80% to 99% (2 of these had carotid artery stenting reintervention), and 2 had late carotid occlusion. All of these were asymptomatic, except for one who had a transient ischemic attack. The mean time to \u226550% to <80% restenosis was 14.7 months vs 19.8 months for \u226580% restenosis after the CEA. Freedom from restenosis rates were 98%, 96%, 94%, 94%, and 94% for \u226550% restenosis and 99%, 98%, 97%, 97%, and 97% for \u226580% restenosis at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years, respectively. Freedom from myocardial infarction, stroke, and deaths was not significantly different between patients with and without restenosis (100%, 93%, 83%, and 83% vs 94%, 91%, 86%, and 79% at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years, respectively; P = .951). The estimated charge of this surveillance was 3.6 \u00d7 489 (number of CEAs) \u00d7 $800 (charge for carotid duplex ultrasound), which equals $1,408,320, to detect only four patients with \u226580% to 99% restenosis who may have been potential candidates for reintervention.\nThis study shows that the value of routine postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance after CEA with patch closure may be limited, particularly if the finding on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound is normal or shows minimal disease.",

Ten of these had residual postoperative \u226550% stenosis, and 37 did not undergo a second duplex ultrasound examination and therefore were not included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 1-63 months), with a mean number of duplex ultrasound examinations of 3.6 (range, 1-7). Eleven of 397 patients (2.8%) with a normal finding on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound vs 4 of 45 (8.9%) with mild stenosis on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound progressed to \u226550% restenosis (P = .055). Overall, 15 patients (3.1%) had \u226550% restenosis, 9 with 50% to <80% and 4 with 80% to 99% (2 of these had carotid artery stenting reintervention), and 2 had late carotid occlusion. All of these were asymptomatic, except for one who had a transient ischemic attack. The mean time to \u226550% to <80% restenosis was 14.7 months vs 19.8 months for \u226580% restenosis after the CEA. Freedom from restenosis rates were 98%, 96%, 94%, 94%, and 94% for \u226550% restenosis and 99%, 98%, 97%, 97%, and 97% for \u226580% restenosis at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years, respectively. Freedom from myocardial infarction, stroke, and deaths was not significantly different between patients with and without restenosis (100%, 93%, 83%, and 83% vs 94%, 91%, 86%, and 79% at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years, respectively; P = .951). The estimated charge of this surveillance was 3.6 \u00d7 489 (number of CEAs) \u00d7 $800 (charge for carotid duplex ultrasound), which equals $1,408,320, to detect only four patients with \u226580% to 99% restenosis who may have been potential candidates for reintervention.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication (PAD-IC) negatively affects physical activity and function. There is evidence for plantarflexor muscle dysfunction and weakness; however, the extent to which this dysfunction can be attributed to reduced muscle size or quality, or both, is not yet known. This study investigated whether in vivo plantarflexor muscle quality during static and dynamic contractions is altered by PAD-IC and whether such changes are associated with impaired walking endurance according to initial and absolute claudication distances.\nThe study recruited 22 participants, consisting of 10 healthy controls and 12 claudicant patients with occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (seven unilateral and five bilateral). Muscle quality of the combined gastrocnemius muscles during static contractions was calculated by normalizing the estimated maximal potential muscle force to the physiological cross-sectional area of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius. Muscle quality during dynamic contractions of the combined plantarflexor muscles was calculated as the ratio of peak voluntary concentric plantarflexor power and the summed volume of lateral and medial gastrocnemius.\nDynamic muscle quality was 24% lower in the claudicating-limb and asymptomatic-limb groups compared with controls (P = .017 and P = .023). The differences were most apparent at the highest contraction velocity (180\u00b0/s). Dynamic muscle quality was associated with reduced walking endurance (R = 0.689, P = .006 and R = 0.550, P = .042 for initial and absolute claudication distance, respectively). The claudicating-limb group demonstrated a trend toward reduced static muscle quality compared with controls (22%, P = .084). The relative contribution of the soleus muscle to plantarflexion maximum voluntary contraction was significantly higher in the claudicating-limb and asymptomatic-limb groups than in controls (P = .012 and P = .018).\nThe muscle strength of the plantarflexors in those with PAD-IC appears to be impaired at high contraction velocities. This may be explained by some reduction in gastrocnemii muscle quality and a greater reliance on the prominently type I-fibered soleus muscle. The reduced dynamic capability of the plantarflexor muscles was associated with disease severity and walking ability; therefore, efforts to improve plantarflexor power through dynamic exercise intervention are vital to maintain functional performance.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the association of intraoperative completion imaging (CI) for lower extremity vein bypass to a below-knee target with primary patency in the Vascular Quality Initiative.\nThe Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried from January 2003 to October 2013 for lower extremity bypass (LEB) procedures that were elective, had an indication of occlusive disease, used a single-segment greater saphenous vein conduit, and had a below-knee target. LEBs with inflow arteries above the knee and below the knee were included. LEBs with concomitant endovascular procedures were excluded. CI was defined as completion angiography, completion duplex ultrasound, or both. The end points were primary patency at discharge and at 1 year. Multivariable analysis was performed controlling for patient demographics, comorbidities, bypass characteristics, and center.\nOf 14,284 LEBs that were performed during the study period, 3147 satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of 1457 (46%) that underwent CI, 287 (20%) underwent duplex ultrasound, 1116 (77%) underwent angiography, and 54 (3.7%) underwent both duplex ultrasound and angiography. There were more patients in the CI group with a history of smoking and a bypass graft crossing the knee. There was no difference in primary patency at discharge between the two groups (CI, 93.2% vs no CI, 93.8%; P = .52). Of the patients who underwent CI, the discharge primary patency was 95.1% for completion duplex ultrasound vs 92.8% for completion angiography (P = .17). On multivariable analysis, there was no significant association of CI with discharge primary patency (P = .69). The 1-year primary patency was 63% in the CI group vs 68% in the no CI group (P = .051). The 1-year primary patency was 60% for the duplex ultrasound group vs 65% for the angiography group (P = .61). On multivariable analysis, there was no significant association of CI with 1-year primary patency (P = .69).\nIn electively performed LEBs using single-segment saphenous vein to a below-knee target artery for occlusive disease, CI does not influence primary graft patency at discharge or at 1 year.",

    "abstract": "Locoregional anesthesia is an effective method for evaluating cerebral function during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Landmark-guided regional anesthesia (RA) is currently used for CEA and can provoke substantial perioperative hypertension. Ultrasound-guided RA (US-RA) is a new method for performing RA in CEA; however, the effect on sympathetic activity and blood pressure is uncertain. This study assessed early sympathetic activity during CEA in US-RA compared with general anesthesia (GA).\nPatients were prospectively randomized to receive US-RA (n = 32) or GA (n = 28) for CEA. The primary end point was the change in systolic arterial blood pressure after induction of anesthesia (just before starting surgery) comparing US-RA with GA. We also recorded heart rate and analyzed concentrations of plasma blood hormones, including cortisol, metanephrine, and normetanephrine at five different times. Creatinine kinase, troponin I, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were analyzed to detect potential changes in cardiac biomarkers during the procedure.\nSystolic arterial blood pressure (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) increased significantly in US-RA patients compared with GA patients even before surgery was initiated (180 \u00b1 26 mm Hg vs 109 \u00b1 24 mm Hg; P < .001), then remained elevated during the entire surgery and returned to baseline values 1 hour after admission to the postoperative anesthesia care unit. Heart rate (US-RA: 78 \u00b1 16 beats/min, GA: 52 \u00b1 12 beats/min; P < .001) and cortisol levels (US-RA: 155 \u00b1 97 \u03bcg/L, GA: 99 \u00b1 43 \u03bcg/L; P = .006) were also significantly higher in the US-RA group after induction of anesthesia. Other values did not differ.\nThe US-RA technique for CEA induces temporary intraoperative hypertension and an increase in stress hormone levels. Nevertheless, US-RA is a feasible, effective, and safe form of locoregional for CEA that enables targeted placement of low volumes of local anesthesia under direct visualization.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the outcomes of single-stent vs kissing-stents techniques in asymmetric complex aortoiliac bifurcation (ACAB) lesions.\nWe retrospectively investigated 80 consecutive patients (69 males, 66.6 \u00b1 8.7 years) treated with a single stent and 30 patients (26 males, 67.1 \u00b1 7.7 years) treated with kissing stents for ACAB between January 2005 and December 2012 from a single-center cohort. A ACAB lesion was defined as a symptomatic unilateral common iliac artery stenosis (>50%) combined with intermediate stenosis (30%-50%) in the contralateral common iliac artery ostium. The primary end point was the primary patency of the ACAB.\nThe baseline clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between the single-stent and the kissing-stents group. Technical success was achieved in all patients. The single-stent group required fewer stents (1.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs 2.3 \u00b1 0.8; P < .001) and less bilateral femoral access (55% vs 100%; P < .001). Two patients in the single-stent group (3%) required bailout kissing stents because of plaque shift to the contralateral side. The major complication rates were 8% in single-stent vs 13% in the kissing-stent group, which was similar (P = .399). At 3 years, the single-stent and kissing-stents group had similar rates of primary patency (89% vs 87%; P = .916) and target lesion revascularization-free survival (93% vs 87%; P = .462).\nThe single-stent technique in ACAB was safe and showed midterm outcomes comparable with those of kissing stents. Considering the benefits, such as fewer stents, less bilateral femoral access, and the availability of contralateral access for future intervention, the single-stent technique may be an advantageous treatment option in ACAB.",

    "abstract": "Vascular reconstruction can facilitate pancreas tumor resection, but optimal methods of reconstruction are not well studied. We report our results for portal vein reconstruction (PVR) for pancreatic resection and determinants of postoperative patency.\nWe identified 173 patients with PVR in a prospective database of 6522 patients who underwent pancreatic resection at our hospital from 1970 to 2014. There were 128 patients who had >1 year of follow-up with computed tomography imaging. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were recorded. Patients with and without postoperative PVR thrombosis were compared by univariable, multivariable, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.\nThe survival of patients was 100% at 1 month, 88% at 6 months, 66% at 1 year, and 39% on overall median follow-up of 310 days (interquartile range, 417 days). Median survival was 15.5 months (interquartile range, 25 months); 86% of resections were for cancer. Four types of PVR techniques were used: 83% of PVRs were performed by primary repair, 8.7% with interposition vein graft, 4.7% with interposition prosthetic graft, and 4.7% with patch. PVR patency was 100% at 1 day, 98% at 1 month, 91% at 6 months, and 83% at 1 year. Patients with PVR thrombosis were not significantly different from patients with patent PVR in age, survival, preoperative comorbidities, tumor characteristics, perioperative blood loss or transfusion, or postoperative complications. They were more likely to have had preoperative chemotherapy (53% vs 9%; P < .0001), radiation therapy (35% vs 2%; P < .0001), and prolonged operative time (618 \u00b1 57 vs 424 \u00b1 20 minutes; P = .002) and to develop postoperative ascites (76% vs 22%; P < .001). Among patients who developed ascites, 38% of those with PVR thrombosis did so in the setting of tumor recurrence at the porta detected on imaging, whereas among patients with patent PVR, 50% did so (P = .73). Patients with PVR thrombosis were more likely to have had prosthetic graft placement compared with patients with patent PVRs (18% vs 2.7%; P = .03; odds ratio [OR], 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-42). PVR patency overall was significantly worse for patients who had an interposition prosthetic graft reconstruction (log-rank, P = .04). On multivariable analysis, operative time (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02) and prosthetic graft placement (OR, 8.12; 95% CI, 1.1-74) were independent predictors of PVR thrombosis (C statistic = 0.88).\nLong operative times and use of prosthetic grafts for reconstruction are risk factors for postoperative portal vein thrombosis. Primary repair, patch, or vein interposition should be preferentially used for PVR in the setting of pancreatic resection.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in endograft devices, operator technique, and patient selection, endovascular repair has not achieved the long-term durability of open surgical aneurysm repair. Persistent or recurrent aneurysm sac flow from failed proximal sealing, component failure, or branch vessel flow underpins a significant rate of reintervention after endovascular repair. The Nellix device (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) employs a unique design with deployment of polymer-filled EndoBags surrounding the endograft flow lumens, sealing the aneurysm sac space and potentially reducing complications from persistent sac flow. This retrospective analysis represents the initial experience in consecutive patients treated with the device in real-world practice.\nThis study was performed at six clinical centers in Europe and one in New Zealand during the initial period after commercialization of the Nellix device. Patients underwent evaluation with computed tomography and other imaging modalities following local standards of care. Patients were selected for treatment with Nellix and treated by each institution according to its endovascular repair protocol. Clinical and imaging end points included technical success (successful device deployment and absence of any endoleak at completion angiography), freedom from all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality, endoleak by type, limb occlusion, aneurysm rupture, and reintervention.\nDuring a 17-month period, 171 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated with the Nellix device and observed for a median of 5 months (range, 0-14 months). The 153 male and 18 female patients with mean age of 74 \u00b1 7 years had aneurysms 61 \u00b1 9 mm in diameter with an average infrarenal neck length of 28 \u00b1 15 mm and infrarenal angulation of 37 \u00b1 22 degrees. Technical success was achieved in all but two patients (99%); one patient had a type Ib endoleak and another had a type II endoleak. Through the last available follow-up, type Ia endoleak was observed in five patients (3%), type Ib endoleak in four patients (2%), and type II endoleak in four patients (2%). There were eight limb occlusions (5%), among which seven were evident at the 1-month follow-up visit. Aneurysm-related reinterventions were performed in 15 patients (9%). There were no aneurysm ruptures or open surgical conversions.\nThis first multicenter postmarket report of the Nellix device for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair demonstrates satisfactory results during the initial learning phase of this new technology. The rate of aneurysm exclusion was high, and frequency of complications was low. More definitive conclusions on the value of this novel device await the results of the ongoing Nellix EVAS FORWARD Global Registry and the EVAS FORWARD investigational device exemption trial.",

    "abstract": "More than 85% of patients with end-stage renal disease start dialysis through a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) for long periods while their arteriovenous fistula or vascular access graft (arteriovenous graft [AVG]) matures. Because TDCs are associated with a high risk of complications, including death and infection, use of an AVG that can be cannulated safely immediately after implantation may reduce morbidity in these patients by allowing earlier TDC removal. We report a prospective multicenter study of a new early-cannulation AVG (Gore ACUSEAL Vascular Graft; W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz).\nPatients requiring creation of a prosthetic vascular access for hemodialysis were enrolled between July 2010 and February 2012 and observed for 12 months. Data were collected on the patients' baseline characteristics; location, position, loss of patency, and revisions of prior AVGs; dialysis sessions using the AVG; and major adverse events related to graft implantation or cannulation. Cumulative and primary unassisted graft patency rates were calculated. A subgroup analysis compared outcomes in patients in whom the AVG was first cannulated within 72 hours after implantation with outcomes in patients in whom the initial cannulation was performed >21 days postoperatively.\nThe population of this study was formed by 138 patients who received an ACUSEAL graft. During follow-up, 17 patients died and the AVG was abandoned in 27. The median value for follow-up was 360 days for all patients (variance 15,387). The overall mean time to initial cannulation was 15 days, with 54 grafts (40%) first cannulated within 72 hours after graft implantation and 33 grafts first cannulated >21 days afterward. The reason for late cannulation in some patients was dependent on the implanting surgeon's decision and the surgeon's personal experience with early cannulating grafts. The 1-year overall cumulative patency rate was 79% (95% confidence interval, 71%-85%); the primary unassisted patency rate was 35% (95% confidence interval, 27%-44%). Adverse events included 6 hematomas (two of which were related to cannulation and occurred 107 and 169 days, respectively, after AVG implantation), 15 graft infections, and 15 cases of steal syndrome requiring intervention. Patients in the early- and later-cannulation groups had similar characteristics and no significant differences in rates of cumulative or primary unassisted patency or adverse events.\nThis study demonstrated that the new, early-cannulation AVG graft can be cannulated soon after implantation without a significant difference in patency and complication rates compared with rates associated with standard cannulation of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in the literature. This new AVG may allow early removal or avoidance of TDC use in patients undergoing hemodialysis, potentially reducing or eliminating the number of days of catheter-dependent dialysis, but further studies will be needed to demonstrate this potential.",

    "abstract": "Many believe extremes of age correlate with poorer outcomes in treatment for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We hypothesized that the youngest patients would have significantly poorer outcomes compared with older cohorts due to the precocious nature of their PAD.\nWe studied all patients in the Vascular Study Group of New England database undergoing infrainguinal bypass for PAD between 2003 and 2013. Age was grouped by <50 years, 50 to 79 years, and \u226580 years. Our primary outcomes were 1-year freedom from a major adverse limb event (MALE), defined as ipsilateral amputation or need for secondary intervention, and amputation-free survival. A second analysis was performed to analyze the subgroup of patients aged <50 years with critical limb ischemia (CLI), which included a Cox regression model to determine risk factors for MALE or death at 1 year.\nOf 5265 patients who were treated with infrainguinal bypass for PAD, 324 (6.2%) were aged <50 years. The mean age was 44.6 years, and 66.4% were male. The proportion of African Americans was significantly higher in the youngest age group (<50 years: 6.8% vs 50-79 years: 3.5%, P = .002; vs \u226580 years: 3.5%, P = .013). More bypasses were done for claudication than acute limb ischemia in patients aged <50 years (33.3% vs 11.4%). More vein grafts were used vs prosthetic (<50 years: 72.1% vs 50-79 years: 65.9%, P = .024; vs \u226580 years: 62.6%, P = .002). Fewer concomitant proximal procedures were performed compared with the older groups (<50 years: 37.7% vs 50-79 years: 51.1%, P < .001; vs \u226580 years: 39.5%, P = .045).

Further, although the youngest patients with CLI have similar MALEs, their amputation rates are higher than in older cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) carries a high mortality rate, even with prompt transfer to a medical center. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that improves predictive ability through pattern recognition while continually adapting to new input data. The goal of this study was to effectively use ANN modeling to provide vascular surgeons a discriminant adjunct to assess the likelihood of in-hospital mortality on a pending rAAA admission using easily obtainable patient information from the field.\nOf 332 total patients from a single institution from 1998 to 2013 who had attempted rAAA repair, 125 were reviewed for preoperative factors associated with in-hospital mortality; 108 patients received an open operation, and 17 patients received endovascular repair. Five variables were found significant on multivariate analysis (P < .05), and four of these five (preoperative shock, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and age) were modeled by multiple logistic regression and an ANN. These predictive models were compared against the Glasgow Aneurysm Score. All models were assessed by generation of receiver operating characteristic curves and actual vs predicted outcomes plots, with area under the curve and Pearson r(2) value as the primary measures of discriminant ability.\nOf the 125 patients, 53 (42%) did not survive to discharge. Five preoperative factors were significant (P < .05) independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis: advanced age, renal disease, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and shock, although renal disease was excluded from the models. The sequential accumulation of zero to four of these risk factors progressively increased overall mortality rate, from 11% to 16% to 44% to 76% to 89% (age \u2265 70 years considered a risk factor). Algorithms derived from multiple logistic regression, ANN, and Glasgow Aneurysm Score models generated area under the curve values of 0.85 \u00b1 0.04, 0.88 \u00b1 0.04 (training set), and 0.77 \u00b1 0.06 and Pearson r(2) values of .36, .52 and .17, respectively. The ANN model represented the most discriminant of the three.\nAn ANN-based predictive model may represent a simple, useful, and highly discriminant adjunct to the vascular surgeon in accurately identifying those patients who may carry a high mortality risk from attempted repair of rAAA, using only easily definable preoperative variables. Although still requiring external validation, our model is available for demonstration at https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=NN97NM7DTK.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has been performed by various surgical specialties for many years. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) may be a disruptive technology, having an impact on which specialties care for patients with AAA. Therefore, we examined the proportion of AAA repairs performed by various specialties over time in the United States and evaluated the impact of the introduction of EVAR.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001-2009) was queried for intact and ruptured AAA and for open repair and EVAR. Specific procedures were used to identify vascular surgeons (VSs), cardiac surgeons (CSs), and general surgeons (GSs) as well as interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists for states that reported unique treating physician identifiers. Annual procedure volumes were subsequently calculated for each specialty.\nWe identified 108,587 EVARs and 85,080 open AAA repairs (3011 EVARs and 12,811 open repairs for ruptured AAA). VSs performed an increasing proportion of AAA repairs during the study period (52% in 2001 to 66% in 2009; P < .001). GSs and CSs performed fewer repairs during the same period (25% to 17% [P < .001] and 19% to 13% [P < .001], respectively). EVAR was increasingly used for intact (33% to 78% of annual cases; P < .001) as well as ruptured AAA repair (5% to 28%; P < .001). The proportion of intact open repairs performed by VSs increased from 52% to 65% (P < .001), whereas for EVAR, the proportion went from 60% to 67% (P < .001). The proportion performed by VSs increased for ruptured open repairs from 37% to 53% (P < .001) and for ruptured EVARs from 28% to 73% (P < .001). Compared with treatment by VSs, treatment by a CS (0.55 [0.53-0.56]) and GS (0.66 [0.64-0.68]) was associated with a decreased likelihood of undergoing endovascular rather than open AAA repair.\nVSs are performing an increasing majority of AAA repairs, in large part driven by the increased utilization of EVAR for both intact and ruptured AAA repair. However, GSs and CSs still perform AAA repair. Further studies should examine the implications of these national trends on the outcome of AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Advances in endovascular technology have led to the successful treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, there is currently no consensus on what constitutes a juxtarenal, pararenal, or suprarenal aneurysm. There is emerging evidence that the extent of the aneurysm repair is associated with outcome. We compare the outcomes of 150 consecutive patients treated with a fenestrated or branched stent graft and present the data stratified according to the Society for Vascular Surgery classification based on proximal anatomic landing zones.\nA prospectively collected database of consecutive patients undergoing fenestrated or branched stent graft insertion in a tertiary center between 2008 and 2013 was retrospectively analyzed. Aneurysms were subdivided into zones according to where the area of proximal seal could be achieved in relation to the visceral arteries. Zone 8 covers the renal arteries, zone 7 covers the superior mesenteric artery, and zone 6 covers the celiac axis. Patient demographics, operative variables, mortality, and major morbidity were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis to assess for differences between zones.\nDuring the study period, 150 patients were treated. There were 49 in zone 8, 76 in zone 7, and 25 in zone 6. Prior aortic surgery had been performed in 19 patients, which included 11 patients with previous endovascular aneurysm repairs. There was significantly increased blood loss (P < .001), operative time (P < .0001), total hospital stay (P = .018), and intensive care unit stay (P < .0001) as the zones ascended the aorta. There were 14 inpatient deaths recorded across all zones with a 30-day mortality rate of 8%. Logistic regression analysis for 30 day mortality showed a significant increase as the zones ascended (P = .007). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 5-year survival significantly deteriorated as the zones ascended (P = .039), with no significant difference in the freedom from reintervention curves between zones (P = .37).\nWe have shown that the extent of the aneurysm repair as determined by the proximal sealing zone is associated with outcome. Mortality, operative duration, blood loss, and hospital stay all significantly increased as the zones ascended. These data also validate the use of the proposed new classification based on aortic anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Isolated iliac artery aneurysms are rare, but potentially fatal. The effect of recent trends in the use of endovascular iliac aneurysm repair (EVIR) on isolated iliac artery aneurysm-associated mortality is unknown.\nWe identified all patients with a primary diagnosis of iliac artery aneurysm in the National Inpatient Sample from 1988 to 2011. We examined trends in management (open vs EVIR, elective and urgent) and overall isolated iliac artery aneurysm-related deaths (with or without repair). We compared in-hospital mortality and complications for the subgroup of patients undergoing elective open and EVIR from 2000 to 2011.\nWe identified 33,161 patients undergoing isolated iliac artery aneurysm repair from 1988 to 2011, of which there were 9016 EVIR and 4933 open elective repairs from 2000 to 2011. Total repairs increased after the introduction of EVIR, from 28 to 71 per 10 million United States (U.S.) population (P < .001). EVIR surpassed open repair in 2003. Total isolated iliac artery aneurysm-related deaths, due to rupture or elective repair, decreased after the introduction of EVIR from 4.4 to 2.3 per 10 million U.S. population (P < .001). However, urgent admissions did not decrease during this time period (15 to 15 procedures per 10 million U.S. population; P = .30). Among elective repairs after 2000, EVIR patients were older (72.4 vs 69.4 years; P = .002) and were more likely to have a history of prior myocardial infarction (14.0% vs 11.3%; P < .001) and renal failure (7.2% vs 3.6%; P < .001). Open repair had significantly higher rate of in-hospital mortality (1.8% vs 0.5%; P < .001) and complications (17.9% vs 6.7%; P < .001) and a longer length of stay (6.7 vs 2.3 days; P < .001).\nTreatment of isolated iliac artery aneurysms has increased since the introduction of EVIR and is associated with lower perioperative mortality, despite a higher burden of comorbid illness. Decreasing iliac artery aneurysm-attributable in-hospital deaths are likely related primarily to lower elective mortality with EVIR rather than rupture prevention.",

Total repairs increased after the introduction of EVIR, from 28 to 71 per 10 million United States (U.S.) population (P < .001). EVIR surpassed open repair in 2003. Total isolated iliac artery aneurysm-related deaths, due to rupture or elective repair, decreased after the introduction of EVIR from 4.4 to 2.3 per 10 million U.S. population (P < .001). However, urgent admissions did not decrease during this time period (15 to 15 procedures per 10 million U.S. population; P = .30). Among elective repairs after 2000, EVIR patients were older (72.4 vs 69.4 years; P = .002) and were more likely to have a history of prior myocardial infarction (14.0% vs 11.3%; P < .001) and renal failure (7.2% vs 3.6%; P < .001). Open repair had significantly higher rate of in-hospital mortality (1.8% vs 0.5%; P < .001) and complications (17.9% vs 6.7%; P < .001) and a longer length of stay (6.7 vs 2.3 days; P < .001).",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare outcomes after open repair (OR) vs endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nClinical data of consecutive patients treated for asymptomatic AAA between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. Patients were stratified into low/normal-risk (comorbidity score \u2264 10) and high-risk (score > 10) categories. The primary end point was all-cause mortality; secondary end points were complications, reinterventions, conversions, and ruptures. Propensity score-based matching was performed to compare outcomes.\nThere were 1534 patients, of whom 207 were women (13%); 641 (42%) were treated with OR and 893 (58%) with EVAR. After propensity score matching, we selected 558 pairs of OR and EVAR (mean age, 73 \u00b1 7.6 years); 158 were women (14%). The 30-day mortality rate was 1.3% after OR and 0.9% after EVAR (P = .56). In multivariable analysis, only high risk was an independent predictor of early mortality (odds ratio, 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-18; P = .03). The early complication rate was lower for EVAR (13%; odds ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8; P < .001) than for OR (24%). Median follow-up was 7.6 years (31 days-13.1 years). The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 72% after EVAR and 81% after OR (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.73; P < .001). The 5-year survival was not significantly different in matched cohorts operated on after 2005 (77% vs 81%; P = .57). High risk, advanced age, cancer history, AAA size, and EVAR predicted all-cause mortality. Freedom from reintervention was 74% after EVAR and 88% after OR (hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.92-3.51; P < .001). Freedom from rupture was 99.2% after EVAR and 99.8% after OR (P = .04). In multivariable models, female gender was associated with complications; EVAR was associated with reinterventions (P < .05).\nIn this retrospective propensity score-matched study, early mortality was similarly low after both EVAR and OR, significantly different from all except one large randomized controlled trial. EVAR had fewer early complications, but it was associated with late all-cause mortality and reinterventions and had a small but definite risk of late rupture. Significantly increased mortality at 5 years was no longer observed when operations were performed after 2005. High risk, advanced age, cancer history, and AAA size predicted late all-cause mortality. This study failed to confirm early or late survival benefit for EVAR vs OR. Improved surveillance, longer follow-up, and analysis of factors affecting late death in prospective studies are warranted.",

The primary outcome was graft patency. The secondary outcome was limb salvage. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for baseline confounding variables.\nA total of 407 infrainguinal bypasses to below-knee targets were analyzed; 255 patients (63%) received a single-segment GSV, 106 patients (26%) received an AAV, and 46 patients (11%) received a prosthetic conduit. Baseline characteristics were similar among groups, with the exception of popliteal targets and anticoagulation use being more frequent in the prosthetic group. Primary patency at 2 and 5 years was estimated at 47% and 32%, respectively, for the GSV group; 24% and 23% for the AAV group; and 43% and 38% for the prosthetic group.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated endoleak level and size decrease of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with coil embolization in patients at high risk for type II endoleak.\nBetween 2009 and 2013, 83 of 187 patients (44.3%) who underwent EVAR for AAA also underwent coil embolization of the aneurysm sac immediately after complete stent graft release because of risk factors for type II endoleak, including absence of a circumferential thrombus, two or more pairs of patent lumbar arteries, or a patent inferior mesenteric artery. Coil embolization was achieved using a 4F catheter with a microcatheter placed between the stent graft and the aneurysm wall. Computed tomography and color duplex ultrasound imaging were performed 1, 6, 12, and 24 months later to look for an endoleak and assess aneurysm sac diameter.\nMean follow-up was 24 \u00b1 11 months (range, 6-53 months). A mean of 12 coils (range, 4-23) was used. Technical success was achieved in all patients, with no procedurally related complications. Follow-up computed tomography showed type II endoleak in one patient. Aneurysm sac diameter was significantly decreased after 6 months (P = .001), 12 months (P = .001), and 24 months (P = .001). Surgery was required in one patient for common femoral artery occlusion unrelated to the procedure and in another patient for distal type I endoleak.\nAneurysm sac coil embolization during EVAR for patients at risk for type II endoleak is technically feasible, safe, and effective in preventing type II endoleak. This procedure leads to rapid AAA shrinkage. Thus, coil embolization could be used routinely to improve EVAR outcomes for patients at risk for type II endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Surgeon radiation dose during complex fluoroscopically guided interventions (FGIs) has not been well studied. We sought to characterize radiation exposure to surgeons during FGIs based on procedure type, operator position, level of operator training, upper vs lower body exposure, and addition of protective shielding.\nOptically stimulable, luminescent nanoDot (Landauer, Inc, Glenwood, Ill) detectors were used to measure radiation dose prospectively to surgeons during FGIs. The nanoDot dosimeters were placed outside the lead apron of the primary and assistant operators at the left upper chest and left lower pelvis positions. For each case, the procedure type, the reference air kerma, the kerma-area product, the relative position of the operator, the level of training of the fellow, and the presence or absence of external additional shielding devices were recorded. Three positions were assigned on the right-hand side of the patient in decreasing relative proximity to the flat panel detector (A, B, and C, respectively). Position A (main operator) was closest to the flat panel detector. Position D was on the left side of the patient at the brachial access site. The nanoDots were read using a microSTARii medical dosimetry system (Landauer, Inc) after every procedure. The nanoDot dosimetry system was calibrated for scattered radiation in an endovascular suite with a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable solid-state radiation detector (Piranha T20; RTI Electronics, Fairfield, NJ). Comparative statistical analysis of nanoDot dose levels between categories was performed by analysis of variance with Tukey pairwise comparisons. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.\nThere were 415 nanoDot measurements with the following case distribution: 16 thoracic endovascular aortic repairs/endovascular aneurysm repairs, 18 fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repairs (FEVARs), 13 embolizations, 41 lower extremity interventions, 10 fistulograms, 13 visceral interventions, and 3 cerebrovascular procedures. The mean operator effective dose for FEVARs was higher than for other case types (P < .03), 20 \u03bcSv at position A and 9 \u03bcSv at position B. For all case types, position A (9.0 \u03bcSv) and position D (20 \u03bcSv) received statistically higher effective doses than position B (4 \u03bcSv) or position C (0.4 \u03bcSv) (P < .001). However, the mean operator effective dose for position D was not statistically different from that for position A. The addition of the lead skirt significantly decreased the lower body dose (33 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcSv to 6.3 \u00b1 3.3 \u03bcSv) but not the upper body dose (6.5 \u00b1 3.3 \u03bcSv to 5.7 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcSv). Neither ceiling-mounted shielding nor level of fellow training affected operator dose.\nSurgeon radiation dose during FGIs depends on case type, operator position, and table skirt use but not on the level of fellow training. On the basis of these data, the primary operator could perform approximately 12 FEVARs/wk and have an annual dose <10 mSv, which would not exceed lifetime occupational dose limits during a 35-year career. With practical case loads, operator doses are relatively low and unlikely to exceed occupational limits.",

    "abstract": "The management of an infected aortic endograft can be challenging both operatively and clinically. Although aortic endograft infection is rare, the incidence is likely to increase in the coming years because of ever rising numbers of endovascular aneurysm repairs. Definitive management involves the removal of the endograft through laparotomy. Removal of the graft is technically challenging; no manufacturer's device is available to assist in disengagement of barbed hooks that hold the endograft in position. We present a new technique using the disposable proctoscope as a device to facilitate safe removal of the endograft with minimal damage to the aortic wall.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare perioperative and postoperative outcomes after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in patients with various neck morphologic features.\nData from the Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket Registry (ENGAGE) were used for the analyses. Patients were categorized into three different groups according to proximal aortic neck anatomy: regular (REG), intermediate (INT), and challenging (CHA). REG was defined as AAAs with a proximal neck \u226515 mm combined with a suprarenal angulation (\u03b1) \u226445 degrees and an infrarenal neck angulation (\u00df) \u226460 degrees. INT was defined as AAAs with a proximal neck of 10 to 15 mm combined with \u03b1 \u226445 degrees and \u00df \u226460 degrees or with a proximal neck of >15 mm combined with \u03b1 \u226460 degrees and \u00df = 60 to 75 degrees or \u03b1 = 45 to 60 degrees and \u00df \u226475 degrees. CHA was defined as infrarenal necks that exceed at least one of the three defining factors.\nOverall, 925 patients (75.9%) had REG anatomy, 189 patients (15.5%) had INT anatomy, and 104 patients (8.5%) had CHA anatomy. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar. There was a significant difference in AAA diameter between the REG and CHA groups (59.4 mm vs 65.2 mm; P < .001). Technical success was similar among groups (REG 99.1% vs INT 99.5% vs CHA 97.1%). There were no differences in mortality or the need for secondary procedures within 30 days or at 1 year. A significantly higher rate of type I endoleaks within 30 days was seen in CHA compared with REG (adjusted odds ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.46) and INT (adjusted odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.70), but there was no difference at 1-year follow-up.\nThis real-world, global experience shows promising results and indicates that endovascular AAA repair with the Endurant stent graft (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) is safe and effective in patients with challenging aortic neck anatomy. However, long-term follow-up of patients is required to confirm results.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) have led many physicians to embrace a purely percutaneous approach using the suture-mediated \"preclose\" technique. Whereas there are a number of theoretical benefits, the rate of periprocedural iatrogenic acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. We sought to determine the incidence of acute DVT after percutaneous EVAR (PEVAR).\nThis was a single-center, retrospective review of 52 consecutive patients undergoing elective PEVAR. Demographics, procedural data, and postprocedure lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound data were analyzed by univariate statistical analysis.\nAmong the 52 patients, the average age was 73 years, and the majority were men (n = 44). Only 6% (n = 3) had a prior history of DVT. The majority of procedures were performed under general anesthesia (n = 51 [98%]) with systemic intravenous heparin. Protamine was used in only 13 cases (25%). Sheath sizes ranged from 9F to 20F, with an average of 16F, and closure was achieved using the preclose technique. Postprocedure chemoprophylaxis was administered to 85% of patients (n = 44) during their hospitalization. Median length of stay was 1 day. Acute DVT was identified in 8% of patients (n = 4) on postoperative day 1. Among the 4 DVTs, 25% were femoropopliteal (n = 1) and 75% were calf vein DVTs (n = 3). On follow-up imaging 2 weeks later, 75% of DVTs were resolved. Among the four patients with acute DVT on postoperative day 1, three had associated risk factors: history of DVT (n = 2), active smokers (n = 1), and obesity (body mass index >30; n = 3). The remaining patient had no risk factors but developed an ipsilateral calf vein DVT.\nThe risk of acute DVT after PEVAR is low. Lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound screening is not necessary unless there exist preclinical risk factors or postprocedural clinical indications suggestive of DVT.",

    "abstract": "Coverage of celiac artery (CA) during thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) has been performed to extend the distal seal zone for which preliminary results and short-term follow-up have been reported. We aim to show the outcomes up to 81 months after CA coverage during TEVAR.\nPatients undergoing TEVAR with coverage of the CA origin from 2005 to 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Points of analysis include indications for covering the CA, demonstration of collateral circulation between the CA and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), anatomic features of the distal landing zone, rate of reintervention, technical success, presence of clinical ischemic symptoms after the procedure, and mortality.\nDuring the 9-year period, 366 patients underwent TEVAR, 18 (5%) of whom had CA coverage. Eleven (61%) had TEVAR with CA coverage due to a thoracic aneurysm, three (17%) had thoracic aortic dissection related to aneurysm, and four (22%) had previous TEVAR with a type Ib endoleak (EL) requiring distal coverage. Mesenteric angiography in preparation for TEVAR with CA coverage diagnosed a critical SMA stenosis in one patient that was treated with stenting before the index procedure. At the conclusion of the indicated procedure, two patients (11%) had a type Ia EL and two patients (11%) had a type Ib EL. Three of the type I ELs required reintervention. Two patients (11%) had a type II EL, both of which were managed with observation and resolved. Reintervention was required in 27% of patients. Postoperative complications included visceral ischemia in 2 (11%), weight loss in 1 (5%), spinal cord ischemia in 2 (11%), a cerebrovascular event in 1 (6%), and death in 1 (6%). The mean follow-up period was 38 months (range, 0.5-81 months).\nThis analysis of outcomes up to 81 months supports the suitability of covering the CA in selected patients for extending the distal landing zone to the visceral aortic level above the SMA or when alternative branch vessel treatment is unavailable. Preoperative angiographic evaluation of the mesenteric collaterals and early postoperative surveillance may limit postoperative complications. Once the CA is covered, new symptoms do not develop unless the SMA is compromised.",

    "abstract": "No standards exist for interhospital transfer of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA). As such, many facilities have developed individual approaches to transfer of these patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate areas of agreement and discord for transfer and to determine if current practices may serve as a starting point for developing universal transfer guidelines.\nA survey was prepared regarding requirements for transfer, factors regarding transport, and available resources at the accepting hospital. The survey was then offered to members of the Western Vascular Society. Responses were analyzed by physician practice type. Consensus was defined as at least 70% agreement for a response.\nResponse rate was 40%. The cohort comprised 51% from academic institutions and 94% from metropolitan areas. Patients with rAAA were accepted in transfer by 88% of respondents; a majority accepted transfers from distances of up to 100 miles or more. Most had no formal protocol for transfer or treatment of patients with rAAA. Wide variation was observed regarding local evaluation, clinical status at presentation, pre-existing medical comorbidity and required tests for determining suitability for transfer, and management during transport. Academic physicians were more likely to accept clinically unstable patients and to have capability to offer endovascular aneurysm repair.\nWide variation was observed regarding clinical suitability for transfer, diagnostic criteria and tests before transfer, and essential resources required at the receiving hospital. Reducing existing variation and inefficiencies in the transfer process by developing standard guidelines may improve population-based outcomes for rAAA.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons may aid in primarily nonvascular procedures. Such activity has not been quantified, and hospital administrators may be unaware of the importance of vascular surgeons to support other hospital-based surgical programs. This study reviewed intraoperative consultations by vascular surgeons to support other surgical services.\nIntraoperative vascular consultations were reviewed from January 2006 to January 2014 for consulting service, indication, and whether consultation occurred with advanced notice. Patient demographics, operative times, estimated blood loss, length of stay, and relative value units (RVUs) assigned for each consultation were also assessed. Consultations for trauma and iatrogenic injuries occurring outside the operating theater were excluded.\nVascular surgeons performed 225 intraoperative consultations in support of procedures by nonvascular surgeons. Requesting services were surgical oncology (46%), orthopedics (17%), urology (11%), otolaryngology (7%), and others (19%). Reasons for consultation overlapped and included vascular reconstruction (53%), control of hemorrhage (39%), and assistance with difficult dissections (43%). Seventy-four percent were for intra-abdominal procedures, and venous (53%) and arterial (50%) problems were encountered equally with some overlap. Most patients were male (59%), overweight (56%; body mass index \u226525 kg/m(2)), had previous surgery (72%) and were undergoing elective procedures (89%). Mean total procedural anesthesia time was 9.4 hours, mean procedural operating time was 7.9 hours, and mean total and vascular-related estimated blood loss was 1702 mL and 327 mL, respectively. Mean length of stay was 14.7 days, mean intensive care unit stay was 2.9 days, and 30-day mortality was 6.2%. Mean nonvascular RVUs per operation were 46.0, and mean vascular RVUs per operation were 30.9.\nUnexpected intraoperative need for vascular surgical expertise occurs often enough that vascular surgeons should be regarded as an essential operating room resource to the general operating room, nonvascular surgeons, and their patients. Intraoperative vascular surgical consultation in support of other surgeons requires a high level of open technical operative skills and is time and labor intensive.",

    "abstract": "The cost of health care is increasingly becoming an international issue, with many health care systems requiring evaluation of cost when agreeing to fund health care. In the United Kingdom (UK), for example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence highlights the importance of using cost-effectiveness analyses to facilitate the effective use of resources. This study evaluates the use of cost-effectiveness analyses and the provision of vascular surgery.\nA systematic review of published literature was performed. UK-based studies assessing cost-effectiveness or cost-utility of superficial venous interventions, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) were included. All included studies were quality assessed to determine the overall strength of UK economic evidence for each intervention.\nFour superficial venous, six AAA, and two CEA studies met the inclusion criteria. After quality assessment, the UK evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of superficial venous intervention was graded strong. The economic evidence for asymptomatic and symptomatic CEA was graded limited and insufficient, respectively, owing to a paucity of UK literature in this field. There was strong UK economic evidence affirming that endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to open repair.\nThere is strong economic evidence for symptomatic superficial venous intervention. However, funding for varicose vein treatments remains controversial. Future economic analyses are required for symptomatic and asymptomatic CEA to better advise national policy. Despite strong economic evidence, current UK guidance is for EVAR over open repair in the elective setting, with the majority of elective AAA repairs being EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Despite wide use, high initial success, and acceptable durability of endovascular therapy (EVT) for femoropopliteal (FP) lesions, the frequency of 30-day perioperative complications (POCs) and their effect on clinical outcomes have not been systematically evaluated, which is the subject of this study.\nWe used a multicenter database of 2145 consecutive patients (70% male; overall mean age, 73 \u00b1 9 years) who successfully underwent EVT for FP lesions to investigate independent predictors of POCs (logistic regression analysis) and effect of POCs on prognostic outcomes (Cox proportional regression).\nPOCs were observed in 209 patients (10%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, body mass index <18.5 kg/m(2), critical limb ischemia, and TransAtlanic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease class D lesions were independently associated with POCs (adjusted odds ratios [95% confidence intervals], 2.0 [1.3-2.9], 2.5 [1.9-3.3], and 1.6 [1.2-2.1], respectively). After risk stratification of POCs according to the number of these risk factors, the incidence of POCs was higher in the groups with higher scores. Follow-up for >30 days (mean, 2.3 \u00b1 1.8 years) was available for 2079 of 2145 patients. A Cox hazard regression model adjusted for baseline clinical characteristics showed POCs were negatively and independently associated with future occurrence of major adverse limb events (defined as major amputation and major reintervention) or death (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.6 [1.2-2.1]; P < .05).\nBody mass index <18.5 kg/m(2), critical limb ischemia, and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease class D lesion were positively associated with POCs after EVT for FP lesions. The occurrence of POCs may adversely affect clinical outcomes in the chronic phase.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is usually performed with eversion (ECEA) or conventional (CCEA) technique. Previous studies report conflicting results with respect to outcomes for ECEA and CCEA. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes for ECEA and CCEA.\nDeidentified data for CEA patients were obtained from the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (SVS VQI) database for years 2003 to 2013. Second (contralateral) CEA, reoperative CEA, CEA after previous carotid stenting, or CEA concurrent with cardiac surgery were excluded, leaving 2365 ECEA and 17,155 CCEA for comparison. Univariate analysis compared patients, procedures, and outcomes. Survival analysis was also performed for mortality. Multivariate analysis was used selectively to examine the possible independent predictive value of variables on outcomes.\nGroups were similar with respect to sex, demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative neurologic symptoms, except that ECEA patients tended to be older (71.3 vs 69.8 years; P < .001). CCEA was more often performed with general anesthesia (92% vs 80%; P < .001) and with a shunt (59% vs 24%; P < .001). Immediate perioperative ipsilateral neurologic events (ECEA, 1.3% vs CCEA, 1.2%; P = .86) and any ipsilateral stroke (ECEA, 0.8% vs CCEA, 0.9%; P = .84) were uncommon in both groups. ECEA tended to take less time (median 99 vs 114 minutes; P < .001). However, ECEA more often required a return to the operating room for bleeding (1.4% vs 0.8%; P = .002), a difference that logistic regression analysis showed was only partly explained by differential use of protamine. Life-table estimated 1-year freedom from any cortical neurologic event was similar (96.7% vs 96.7%). Estimated survival was similar comparing ECEA with CCEA at 1 year (96.7% vs 95.9%); however, estimated survival tended to decline more rapidly in ECEA patients after \u223c2 years. Cox proportional hazards modeling confirmed that independent predictors of mortality included age, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smoking, but also demonstrated that CEA type was not an independent predictor of mortality. The 1-year freedom from recurrent stenosis >50% was lower for ECEA (88.8% vs 94.3%, P < .001). However, ECEA and CCEA both had a very high rate of freedom from reoperation at 1 year (99.5% vs 99.6%; P = .67).\nECEA and CCEA appear to provide similar freedom from neurologic morbidity, death, and reintervention. ECEA was associated with significantly shorter procedure times. Furthermore, ECEA obviates the expenses, including increased operative time, associated with use of a patch in CCEA, and a shunt, more often used in CCEA in this database. These potential benefits may be reduced by a slightly greater requirement for early return to the operating room for bleeding.",

    "abstract": "Management of type II endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair can be problematic. This study reports our experience with a relatively novel strategy to treat this complication, transcaval coil embolization (TCCE) of the aneurysm sac.\nWe reviewed 29 consecutive patients undergoing TCCE from 2010 to 2013. Demographics, operative details, and outcomes were assessed.\nSince 2006, 29 TCCEs have been performed at our institution in 26 patients for sac expansion from type II endoleaks. Patients were male (83%) and former or current smokers (88%), with an average age of 78 \u00b1 7.1 years. TCCE was performed a mean of 4.2 \u00b1 4 years after initial endovascular aneurysm repair. Endoleaks resulted in a mean sac growth of 1.2 \u00b1 1 cm in diameter and 37% \u00b1 32% by volume. Forty-six percent had prior procedures (5 translumbar, 3 transarterial, 3 transcaval, 1 aortic cuff, and 1 iliac limb extension). Two patients had no flow identified in the aneurysm sac after puncture was successful, and one was found to have a hygroma rather than arterial flow. An additional two patients had ultimate embolization from sac access between the endograft iliac limb and arterial wall after transcaval puncture failed, for a 90% procedural success (83% for transcaval technical success). Mean fluoroscopy time was 27 \u00b1 13 minutes with 29 \u00b1 21 mL of contrast material used and a median of 10 coils per case. Additional adjuncts included thrombin injection (17%), intravascular ultrasound (14%), sac pressure measurements (28%), and on-table integrated computed tomography (17%). Median length of stay was 1 day (range, 0-5 days). There were no procedural adverse events. Reintervention was required in five cases (three repeated TCCEs, two graft relinings). One-year freedom from reintervention was 95%. At a mean 16.5 months of follow-up, 70% experienced no further endoleak and had stable or decreasing sac diameters. There have been no ruptures during follow-up.\nIn this series, TCCE for treatment of aneurysm enlargement due to type II endoleaks was safe and relatively effective despite prior failed interventions in nearly half of the cases. TCCE is a useful alternative in cases in which the anatomy makes other approaches difficult or impossible.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the incidence, the surgical details, and the outcome of late open conversion after failed endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nA review of English-language medical literature from 1991 to 2014 was conducted using the PubMed and EMBASE databases to find all studies involving late conversion after EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The search identified 26 articles encompassing 641 patients (84% men; median age, 73.5 years).\nMean interval from the initial implantation was 38.5 \u00b1 10.7 months. The cumulative single-center open conversion rate was 3.7%. The indications for late open conversion included endoleak in 62.4%, infection in 9.5%, migration in 5.5%, and thrombosis in 6.7%. Operations were urgent in 22.5% of the patients. The 30-day mortality was 9.1%. Mortality rates were different between elective (3.2%) and nonelective patients (29.2%). Five aneurysm-related deaths (1.5%) and two graft infections (0.6%) occurred during a median follow-up of 26.4 months (range, 5-50.2 months).\nThe number of patients with failed EVAR and without further options for endovascular salvage is growing. Endoleak remains the most important weakness of EVAR as the leading cause of late open conversion. Such procedures, although technically demanding, are associated with relatively low mortality rates when performed electively. Open repair still represents a valuable solution for many patients with failed EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Recent interest has focused on the role of the methyl-arginines, endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide, as adverse prognostic indicators. To date, few studies have assessed the role of symmetric dimethyl-arginine (SDMA) in patients with peripheral arterial disease. We aimed to determine the relationship, if any, of SDMA to all-cause mortality and disease severity as assessed by the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nIn 238 patients with symptomatic PAD and an ABI of <0.8, l-arginine, asymmetric dimethyl-arginine (ADMA) and SDMA levels were measured by hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.\nThe median follow-up was 6 years 11 months (interquartile range [IQR], 4 years 5 months-7 years 10 months). SDMA and ADMA levels were higher in those who died compared with those who survived (0.51 [IQR, 0.44-0.66] \u03bcmol/L vs 0.46 [IQR, 0.39-0.55] \u03bcmol/L, P \u2264 .001; and 0.48 [IQR, 0.41-0.55] \u03bcmol/L vs 0.45 [IQR, 0.39-0.50] \u03bcmol/L, P = .007, respectively). l-arginine levels were similar in the two groups. On multivariate analysis, SDMA and ADMA as continuous variable were significantly associated with mortality (P = .001). For SDMA and ADMA, the highest compared with the lowest quartile levels were significantly associated with mortality (SDMA: hazard ratio, 3.855; 95% confidence interval, 1.625-9.143; P = .002; ADMA: hazard ratio, 2.277; 95% confidence interval, 1.114-4.654; P = .024). ADMA and SDMA showed a negative correlation with severity of PAD as assessed by ABI (r = -0.236, N = 216, P < .001; r = -0.209, N = 208, P = .002, respectively).\nThe novel finding of this study is that SDMA levels were predictive of all cause-mortality and correlated with disease severity. Further studies should assess the role of nitric oxide donors in patients with high levels of SDMA.",

    "abstract": "Stent graft therapy has emerged as an alternative to open surgery in the management of chronic dissection-related aneurysmal degeneration (DRAD) in the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). The incidence of perioperative complications, need for secondary aortic intervention (SAI), and rate of aneurysmal false-lumen thrombosis have not been thoroughly described.\nPerioperative and midterm outcomes in patients who underwent stent graft therapy for chronic DRAD DTA at a single institution between January 2006 and September 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative anatomic factors, including the number of visceral and renal side branches off the false lumen, and false lumen volume, were analyzed for their ability to predict treatment failure. Treatment failure was defined as death, need for a SAI, and failure to achieve thrombosis of the DRAD DTA. Treatment success was defined as thrombosis of the false lumen in the area of the DRAD DTA with stability or a decrease in the maximum diameter of the DRAD DTA.\nDuring the study period, 47 patients underwent stent graft therapy for chronic DRAD DTA. Patients were a mean age of 58.3 \u00b1 11.7 years, 74.5% (n = 35) were male, and 14.9% (n = 7) had a history of connective tissue disease. The left subclavian artery was covered in 48.9% (n = 23), and revascularization was performed in 87.0% (n = 20). Spinal drains were used in 74.5% (n = 35). Spinal cord ischemia developed in 6.4% (n = 3), which resolved in two and improved in one. No retrograde aortic dissections occurred. The 30-day mortality was 4.3% (n = 2); one death was in a patient with rupture. Mean clinical follow-up was 35.1 \u00b1 20.9 months. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 89% \u00b1 5%. Treatment failure occurred in 18 patients (38.3%): 9 required SAIs, 6 did not have thrombosis of the false lumen in the area of the DRAD DTA, and 4 died, with 1 patient dying during a SAI. No preoperative anatomic factor predicted treatment failure. The 5-year freedom from treatment failure was 54% \u00b1 9%. Including the nine patients who underwent SAI, treatment success was achieved in 85.2% of patients.\nIn this single-center experience of stent graft therapy for chronic DRAD DTA, treatment success was achieved in 85% of patients after a SAI rate of 20%. No preoperative anatomic factor predicted treatment failure, which occurred in almost 40% of the patients. Identifying predictors of treatment failure may improve future outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cranial nerve injury (CNI) is the most common neurologic complication of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and can cause significant chronic disability. Data from prior randomized trials are limited and provide no health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes specific to CNI. Incidence of CNIs and their outcomes for patients in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST) were examined to identify factors predictive of CNI and their impact on HRQOL.\nIncidence of CNIs, baseline and procedural characteristics, outcomes, and HRQOL scores were evaluated in the 1151 patients randomized to CEA and undergoing surgery \u226430 days. Patients with CNI were identified and classified using case report forms, adverse event data, and clinical notes. Baseline and procedural characteristics were compared using descriptive statistics. Clinical outcomes at 1 and 12 months were analyzed. All data were adjudicated by two neurologists and a vascular surgeon. HRQOL was evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey to assess general health and Likert scales for disease-specific outcomes at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 months after CEA. The effect of CNI on SF-36 subscales was evaluated using random effects growth curve models, and Likert scale data were compared by ordinal logistic regression.\nCNI was identified in 53 patients (4.6%). Cranial nerves injured were VII (30.2%), XII (24.5%), and IX/X (41.5%), and 3.8% had Horner syndrome. CNI occurred in 52 of 1040 patients (5.0%) receiving general anesthesia and in one of 111 patients (0.9%) operated on under local anesthesia (P = .05). No other predictive baseline or procedural factors were identified. Deficits resolved in 18 patients (34%) at 1 month and in 42 of 52 patients (80.8%) by 1 year. One patient died before the 1-year follow-up visit. The HRQOL evaluation showed no statistical difference between groups with and without CNI at any interval. By Likert scale analysis, the group with CNI showed a significant difference in the difficulty eating/swallowing parameter at 2 and 4 weeks (P < .001) but not at 1 year.\nIn CREST, CNI occurred in 4.6% of patients undergoing CEA, with 34% resolution at 30 days and 80.8% at 1 year. The incidence of CNI was significantly higher in patients undergoing general anesthesia. CNI had a small and transient effect on HRQOL, negatively affecting only difficulty eating/swallowing at 2 and 4 weeks but not at 1 year. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that CNI is not a trivial consequence of CEA but rarely results in significant long-term disability.",

    "abstract": "The effect of stent graft fixation type on renal function after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether suprarenal (SR) or infrarenal (IR) fixation influences the risk of renal complications after EVAR.\nWe searched MEDLINE and EMBASE with no date or language restrictions for comparative studies evaluating EVAR with SR vs IR fixation on renal dysfunction, renal artery stenosis, renal artery occlusion, renal infarction, and new need for hemodialysis. For each outcome, we calculated the absolute risk difference (RD) with a random effects meta-analysis and performed assessments of heterogeneity and publication bias. Post hoc subgroup analyses explored the influence of individual moderator variables.\nA total of 21 nonrandomized studies comparing SR vs IR fixation representing 4474 unique patients (SR, 1949; IR, 2525) were included. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between the SR and IR groups. Median patient follow-up was 12 months in each group. There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of any renal complication between SR and IR fixation groups. The absolute RD between the SR and IR fixation groups was <1%, with no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias for renal dysfunction, renal artery stenosis, renal artery occlusion or new need for hemodialysis after EVAR. Renal infarction occurred in 6.4% of SR patients and in 2.5% of IR patients (P = .09), with evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 85%) and publication bias (Egger P = .08). Subgroup analyses revealed that older studies (median treatment period before 2000) reported greater risks of renal infarction with SR fixation (RD, 6.2%; P = .01). However, more contemporary studies (median treatment period after 2000) demonstrated no difference between SR and IR fixation on renal infarction risk (RD, 0.2%; P = .75).\nThere is no difference in the risk of postoperative renal complications when comparing stent grafts using SR vs IR fixation, particularly with newer-generation devices. Contemporary comparative studies with longer-term follow-up are warranted to further elucidate the influence of SR and IR fixation on renal complications.",

    "abstract": "Registries have been proven useful to assess clinical outcomes, but data entry and personnel expenses are challenging. We developed a registry to track patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) in an integrated health care system, leveraging an electronic medical record (EMR) to evaluate clinical practices, device performance, surgical complications, and medium-term outcomes. This study describes the registry design, data collection, outcomes validation, and ongoing surveillance, highlighting the unique integration with the EMR.\nEVARs in six geographic regions of Kaiser Permanente were entered in the registry. Cases were imported using a screening algorithm of inpatient codes applied to the EMR. Standard note templates containing data fields were used for surgeons to enter preoperative, postoperative, and operative data as part of normal workflows in the operating room and clinics. Clinical content experts reviewed cases and entered any missing data of operative details. Patient comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, implant details, and surgical outcomes were captured. Patients entered in the registry are followed up for life, and all relevant events are captured.\nBetween January 2010 and June 2013, 2112 procedures were entered in the registry. Surgeon compliance with data entry ranges from 60% to 90% by region but has steadily increased over time. Mean aneurysm size was 5.9 cm (standard deviation, 1.3). Most patients were male (84%), were hypertensive (69%), or had a smoking history (79%). The overall reintervention rate was 10.8%: conversion to open repair (0.9%), EVAR revision (2.6%), other surgical intervention (7.3%). Of the reinterventions, 27% were for endoleaks (I, 34.3%; II, 56.9%; III, 8.8%; IV and V, 0.0%), 10.5% were due to graft malfunction, 3.4% were due to infection, and 2.3% were due to rupture.\nLeveraging an EMR provides a robust platform for monitoring short-term and midterm outcomes after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Use of standardized templates in the EMR allows data entry as part of normal workflow, improving compliance, accuracy, and data capture using limited but expert personnel. Assessment of patient demographics, device performance, practice variation, and postoperative outcomes benefits clinical decision-making by providing complete and adjudicated event reporting. The findings from this large, community-based EVAR registry augment other studies limited to perioperative and short-term outcomes or small patient cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are local dilations that can lead to a fatal hemorrhage when ruptured. Wall stress analysis of AAAs is a novel tool that has proven high potential to improve risk stratification. Currently, wall stress analysis of AAAs is based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging; however, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) has great advantages over CT and magnetic resonance imaging in terms of costs, speed, and lack of radiation. In this study, the feasibility of 3D US as input for wall stress analysis is investigated. Second, 3D US-based wall stress analysis was compared with CT-based results.\nThe 3D US and CT data were acquired in 12 patients (diameter, 35-90 mm). US data were segmented manually and compared with automatically acquired CT geometries by calculating the similarity index and Hausdorff distance. Wall stresses were simulated at P = 140 mm Hg and compared between both modalities.\nThe similarity index of US vs CT was 0.75 to 0.91 (n = 12), with a median Hausdorff distance ranging from 4.8 to 13.9 mm, with the higher values found at the proximal and distal sides of the AAA. Wall stresses were in accordance with literature, and a good agreement was found between US- and CT-based median stresses and interquartile stresses, which was confirmed by Bland-Altman and regression analysis (n = 8). Wall stresses based on US were typically higher (+23%), caused by geometric irregularities due to the registration of several 3D volumes and manual segmentation. In future work, an automated US registration and segmentation approach is the essential point of improvement before pursuing large-scale patient studies.\nThis study is a first step toward US-based wall stress analysis, which would be the modality of choice to monitor wall stress development over time because no ionizing radiation and contrast material are involved.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the natural history of patients with acute type B aortic dissection who were initially managed with medical therapy alone.\nAll patients with acute type B aortic dissection who were initially managed medically between March 1999 and March 2011 were included. Failure of medical therapy was defined as any death or aorta-related intervention. Early failure occurred within 15 days of presentation. Predictors of long-term outcomes were determined using backward stepwise regression.\nA total of 298 patients with medically managed acute type B dissections were identified. The cohort had an average age of 65.9 years at presentation and was 61.7% male. There were 174 (58.4%) failures including 119 deaths and 87 interventions (24 endovascular, 63 open); 57 (66%) interventions were performed for aneurysmal degeneration. There were 37 (12%) early failures including 14 deaths and 25 interventions (10 endovascular, 15 open). Aneurysmal degeneration was the indication for intervention in six patients (24%). Mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.1-14.7 years). Kaplan-Meier estimate demonstrated that freedom from intervention was 77.3% \u00b1 2.4% at 3 years and 74.2% \u00b1 2.5% at 6 years. There were no predictors of freedom from intervention. Kaplan-Meier estimate demonstrated that the intervention-free survival was 55.0% \u00b1 3.0% at 3 years and 41.0% \u00b1 3.2% at 6 years. End-stage renal disease was predictive of failure of medical treatment (hazard ratio, 2.60; confidence interval, 1.19-5.66; P = .02), and age >70 years was protective against failure (hazard ratio, 0.97; confidence interval, 0.95-0.98; P < .01). Kaplan-Meier estimate demonstrated that survival after 6 years was higher in patients who underwent interventions (76% vs 58%; P = .018).\nThe majority of patients with acute type B dissection will fail medical therapy over time as evidenced by a 6-year intervention-free survival of 41%. Patients who underwent any aortic intervention had a significant survival advantage over those who were treated with medical management alone.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the association of vein harvesting technique (VHT) with surgical site infection (SSI) and graft patency after infrainguinal arterial bypass.\nThe Vascular Quality Initiative database was used to review VHT of all patients undergoing single-segment great saphenous vein graft infrainguinal arterial bypass from 2003 to 2013. Patients were divided into three groups according to the VHT used (continuous incision, skip incision, and endoscopic). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to estimate propensity scores for each treatment group. Propensity score adjustment was included in multivariable analysis of the primary outcomes: SSI and graft primary patency.\nFrom 2003 to 2013, 5066 patients underwent single-segment great saphenous vein graft infrainguinal bypass. The VHT was continuous incision in 48.6%, skip incision in 39.7%, and endoscopic in 12.7%. SSI rates did not differ significantly among the groups (continuous, 4.7%; skip, 4.0%; endoscopic, 3.4%; P = .278). On multivariable analysis, there was no difference in discharge primary patency between the three groups. At 1 year, primary patency rates were 69.5% for continuous, 73.0% for skip, and 58.6% for endoscopic (P < .001). After multivariable analysis, endoscopic vein harvest was independently associated with higher 1-year primary patency loss compared with both continuous (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.74; P = .020) and skip (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.18-2.00; P = .002). There was no significant difference in 1-year primary patency loss between continuous and skip techniques (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73-1.05; P = .170).\nNo association between the choice of VHT and the development of SSI after infrainguinal arterial bypass was identified in the Vascular Quality Initiative population. Endoscopic VHT was associated with significantly reduced 1-year primary patency rate compared with both continuous and skip techniques.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) represent both a life-threatening emergency for the affected patient and a considerable health burden globally. The aim of this study was to investigate the contemporary epidemiology of rAAA in a defined Norwegian population for which both hospital and autopsy data were available.\nThis was a retrospective, single-center population-based study of rAAA. The study includes all consecutively diagnosed prehospital and in-hospital cases of rAAA in the catchment area of Stavanger University Hospital between January 2000 and December 2012. Incidence and mortality rates (crude and adjusted) were calculated using national demographic data.\nA total of 216 patients with primary rAAA were identified. The adjusted incidence rate for the study period was 11.0 per 100,000 per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-12.5). Twenty patients died out of the hospital, and 144 of the 196 patients (73%) admitted to the hospital underwent surgery. The intervention rate varied from 48% to 81% during the study period. The adjusted mortality rate was 7.5 per 100,000 per year (95% CI, 6.3-8.8). No differences in the incidence and mortality rates were found in comparing early and late periods. The 90-day standardized mortality ratio for the study period was 37.2 (95% CI, 31.6-43.7). The overall 90-day mortality was 68% (146 of 216 persons) and 51% (74 of 144 persons) for the patients treated for rAAA.\nWe found a stable incidence and mortality rate during a decade. The prehospital death rate was lower (9%), the intervention rate (73%) higher, and the total mortality (68%) lower than in most other studies. Geographic and regional differences may influence the epidemiologic description of rAAA and hence should be taken into consideration in comparing outcomes for in-hospital mortality and intervention rates.",

    "abstract": "Color duplex sonography (CDS) today is broadly used in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected cranial or extracranial giant cell arteritis (GCA). This study aimed to determine the prognostic impact of the disease pattern assessed by CDS on the treatment response in GCA.\nThis was a retrospective, longitudinal follow-up study of 43 patients who were diagnosed with GCA at our institution between 2002 and 2010. All patients underwent CDS of the temporal and subclavian/axillary arteries at baseline and were observed for at least 6 months. Vasculitis was sonographically characterized by a circumferential, hypoechogenic wall thickening. According to the CDS findings, patients were categorized into patients with involvement of the subclavian/axillary arteries only (group A1, n = 17), patients with involvement of both the subclavian/axillary arteries and the temporal arteries (group A2, n = 9), and patients with isolated cranial GCA (group B, n = 17). Data on recurrences, corticosteroid doses, and steroid-sparing agents were extracted from the medical records. Treatment response over time was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing.\nThe mean follow-up time was 25.4 months and did not differ between groups (P = .4). Patients in group A1 were significantly younger than patients in groups A2 and B (P < .01). The interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was significantly longer in groups A1 and A2 compared with group B (P < .01). The number of recurrences per month was significantly higher in group A2 compared with group A1 and group B (A1, 0.07; A2, 0.13; B, 0.03; P < .01). Whereas there were no significant differences in the mean time until a daily prednisolone dose <10 mg was reached, patients in group A2 more frequently required steroid-sparing agents (A1, 24%; A2, 56%; B, 24%; P = .04).\nExtensive vascular involvement of both the temporal and subclavian/axillary arteries, as depicted by CDS, may be associated with a poor treatment response in GCA.",

    "abstract": "Prior reports have suggested unfavorable outcomes after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) performed outside of the recommended instructions for use (IFU) guidelines. We report our long-term EVAR experience in a large multicenter registry with regard to adherence to IFU guidelines.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, 489 of 1736 patients who underwent EVAR had preoperative anatomic measurements obtained from the M2S, Inc, imaging database (West Lebanon, NH). We examined outcomes in these patients with regard to whether they had met the device-specific IFU criteria. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and aneurysm-related mortality. Secondary outcomes were endoleak status, adverse events, reintervention, and aneurysm sac size change.\nThe median follow-up for the 489 patients was 3.1 years (interquartile range, 1.6-5.0 years); 58.1% (n = 284) had EVAR performed within IFU guidelines (IFU-adherent group), and 41.9% (n = 205) had EVAR performed outside of IFU guidelines (IFU-nonadherent group). Preoperative anatomic data showed that 62.4% of the IFU-nonadherent group had short neck length, 10.2% had greater angulation than recommended, 7.3% did not meet neck diameter criteria, and 20% had multiple anatomic issues. A small portion (n = 49; 10%) of the 489 patients were lost to follow-up because of leaving membership enrollment (n = 28), moving outside the region (n = 10), or discontinuing image surveillance (n = 11). There was no significant difference in any of the primary or secondary outcomes between the IFU-adherent and IFU-nonadherent groups. Aneurysm sac size change at any time point during follow-up also did not differ significantly between the two groups. A Cox proportional hazard model showed that IFU nonadherence was not predictive of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.0; P = .91). Similarly, IFU nonadherence was not identified as a risk factor for aneurysm-related mortality or adverse events in stepwise Cox proportional hazards models.\nIn our cohort of EVAR patients with detailed preoperative anatomic information and long-term follow-up, overall mortality and aneurysm-related mortality were unaffected by IFU adherence. In addition, rates of endoleak and reintervention after initial EVAR were similar, suggesting that lack of IFU-based anatomic suitability was not a driver of outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Greater flexibility and smaller sizes for introducer sheaths in the newest stent grafts increase the feasibility of endovascular aneurysm repair but raise concerns about long-term limb patency. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of and predictive factors for limb occlusion after use of the Endurant stent graft (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) for abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nThe Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket Registry (ENGAGE) prospectively included 1143 patients treated with bifurcated devices who were observed for up to 2 years. Limb occlusions were evidenced by computed tomography, angiography, or ultrasound. To predict stent graft limb occlusion, a two-step model-building technique was applied. We first identified predictors from a total of 47 covariates obtained at baseline and in the periprocedural period. Subsequently, we reduced the set of potential predictors to key factors that are clinically meaningful. To handle large numbers of covariates, we used the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) method.\nForty-two stent graft limbs occluded in 39 patients (3.4% of the patients). At 2 years, the rate of freedom from stent graft limb occlusion calculated by Kaplan-Meier plot was 97.9% (standard error [SE], 0.33%). Of the 42 occlusions, 13 (31%) were observed within 30 days and 30 (71%) within 6 months. The strongest independent predictors were distal landing zone on the external iliac artery, external iliac artery diameter \u226410 mm, and kinking. High-risk vs low-risk patients were identified according to a decision tree based on the strongest predictors. Freedom from stent graft limb occlusion was 96.1% (SE, 0.64%) in high-risk patients vs 99.6% (SE, 0.19%) in low-risk patients.\nAfter Endurant stent grafting, the incidence of limb occlusion was low. Classifying patients as high risk vs low risk according to the algorithm used in this study may help define specific strategies to prevent limb occlusion and improve the overall results of endovascular aneurysm repair using the latest generation of stent grafts.",

At 2 years, the rate of freedom from stent graft limb occlusion calculated by Kaplan-Meier plot was 97.9% (standard error [SE], 0.33%). Of the 42 occlusions, 13 (31%) were observed within 30 days and 30 (71%) within 6 months. The strongest independent predictors were distal landing zone on the external iliac artery, external iliac artery diameter \u226410 mm, and kinking. High-risk vs low-risk patients were identified according to a decision tree based on the strongest predictors. Freedom from stent graft limb occlusion was 96.1% (SE, 0.64%) in high-risk patients vs 99.6% (SE, 0.19%) in low-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed outcomes for patients with persistent intraoperative type Ia endoleaks after standard endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe study group was identified from a consecutive cohort of 209 patients undergoing EVAR in a tertiary center in the United Kingdom during a 2-year period. Data prospectively collected on departmental computerized databases were retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcome parameters were defined as freedom from type Ia endoleak, EVAR-related reintervention, aneurysm rupture, and aneurysm-related mortality.\nA completion angiogram identified 44 patients (21%) as having a type Ia endoleak, and 33 (75%) had a persistent endoleak after intraoperative adjunctive procedures, including repeated balloon moulding, aortic cuff extension, and Palmaz stent (Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla) deployment. In the 11 patients (25%) whose endoleak was successfully abolished intraoperatively, there was no recurrence of type Ia endoleak or secondary intervention to treat type 1a endoleak during a median follow-up period of 27 months. Of the 33 patients with persistent endoleak, 31 (94%) demonstrated resolution of the endoleak on first surveillance computed tomography angiography. One patient was lost to follow-up. Embolization of the endoleak in another patient was successful using Onyx (Micro Therapeutics, Inc, Irvine, Calif) 8 days after the initial procedure. No type Ia endoleak was identified after this on any surveillance imaging, and the patient was alive 28 months later with a stable aneurysm size. In the rest of the patients, no recurrence of the endoleak in any subsequent imaging was noticed, and no secondary intervention was required during follow-up. No aneurysm-related deaths occurred, and 91% of the patients had a stable or shrinking aneurysm.\nDespite adjunctive intraoperative maneuvers, persistent type Ia endoleaks can be relatively common. Our study indicates that they may be observed in selected patients. Further research is required to investigate the natural course and management of type Ia endoleaks identified intraoperatively.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the practice patterns of intraoperative completion imaging (CI) for lower extremity bypass (LEB) in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI).\nA retrospective review of all LEB procedures in the VQI database from January 2003 to October 2013 was performed. Regions with fewer than 200 LEB procedures were excluded from the regional analysis. The modality of CI was defined as duplex ultrasound, angiography, or both.\nA total of 14,140 LEBs were captured, with the rate of CI being 43%. After exclusion of three regions for insufficient volume (<200 LEBs), 13,945 LEB operations across 13 regions were available for regional analysis. Use of any type of intraoperative CI varied across regions from a low of 8% to a high of 70%, with angiography being performed most frequently. When CI was performed, the type of imaging modality varied between regions from a high of 99% for angiography to a high of 75% for duplex ultrasound. CI was more common in male patients (44% of male patients vs 42% of female patients; P = .032), diabetics (44% of diabetic patients vs 42% of nondiabetic patients; P = .026), and patients with coronary artery disease (45% of patients with coronary artery disease vs 42% of patients with no coronary artery disease; P = .0015). CI was performed less frequently in LEB using single-segment great saphenous vein vs LEB using lesser saphenous, arm, or composite vein (48% vs 57%; P < .0001). CI was used in 51% of LEBs with a tibial or pedal target vessel vs 38% of LEBs with a more proximal target vessel (P < .0001). Patients with an indication of critical limb ischemia underwent CI in 45% of LEBs vs 39% with an indication other than critical limb ischemia (P < .0001).\nWithin the VQI database, considerable practice pattern variation exists in the use of CI. Currently, CI is most commonly employed for patients with critical limb ischemia, infrageniculate target vessel, and disadvantaged venous conduit. Further study is required to standardize and to define the appropriate use of CI for LEBs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to report long-term results of early endovascular aortic aneurysm repair after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nThis was a retrospective analysis of all patients presenting with abdominal aortic aneurysm and coronary artery disease treated during the same hospitalization by endovascular aortic aneurysm repair performed soon after PCI. Primary outcomes were perioperative mortality, perioperative complications, survival after treatment, and freedom from reintervention.\nA total of 20 patients were included, and all completed both procedures. No deaths or abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures occurred between the PCI and the aortic intervention. Perioperative mortality was 5% as one patient died of mesenteric ischemia after endovascular aneurysm repair. Major cardiovascular vascular complications occurred in four patients (20%) and included non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (one) and access vessel complication (three). Mean follow-up was 94 (range, 1-164; standard deviation, 47) months. Estimated survival at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years was 90%, 90%, 90%, and 60%, respectively. A reoperation was required in six patients. Estimated freedom from reintervention at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years was 83%, 83%, 78%, and 72%, respectively.\nOur study indicates that early endovascular aneurysm repair performed within a week after PCI may be a reasonable approach in patients with large or symptomatic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Celiac artery compression by the median arcuate ligament (MAL) is a potential cause of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss that overlaps with other common syndromes. Robotic technology may alter the current paradigm for surgical intervention. Open MAL release is often performed with concurrent bypass for celiac stenosis due to the morbidity of reintervention, whereas the laparoscopic approach is associated with high rates of conversion to open due to bleeding. We hypothesized that a robot-assisted technique might minimize conversion events to open, decrease perioperative morbidity, and defer consideration of vascular bypass at the initial operative setting.\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients treated for MAL syndrome by a multidisciplinary team at a tertiary medical center between September 2012 and December 2013. Diagnosis was based on symptom profile and peak systolic velocity (PSV) >200 cm/s during celiac artery duplex ultrasound imaging. All patients underwent robot-assisted MAL release with simultaneous circumferential neurolysis of the celiac plexus. Postoperative celiac duplex and symptom profiles were reassessed longitudinally to monitor outcomes.\nNine patients (67% women) were evaluated for postprandial pain (100%) and weight loss (100%). All patients had celiac stenosis by mesenteric duplex ultrasound imaging (median PSV, 342; range, 238-637 cm/s), and cross-sectional imaging indicated a fishhook deformity in five (56%). Robot-assisted MAL release was completed successfully in all nine patients (100%) using a standardized surgical technique. Estimated blood loss was <50 mL, with a median hospital stay of 2 days (range, 2-3 days). No postoperative complications of grade \u22653, readmissions or reoperations were observed. All patients (100%) improved symptomatically at the 25-week median follow-up. Three patients experienced complete resolution on postoperative celiac duplex ultrasound imaging, and six patients showed an improved but persistent stenosis (PSV >200 cm/s) compared with preoperative velocities (P < .05 by Wilcoxon signed rank). No patients required additional treatment.\nRobot-assisted MAL release can be performed safely and effectively with avoidance of conversion events and minimal morbidity. Potential factors contributing to success are patient selection by a multidisciplinary team and replication of the open surgical technique by means of robot-assisted dexterity and visualization. The need for delayed reintervention for persistently symptomatic celiac stenosis is uncertain.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the association of serum cystatin C levels with contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and adverse clinical events in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).\nA total of 240 PAD patients who received endovascular therapy were included in this retrospective analysis. Serial serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C before and within 48 hours of endovascular therapy were evaluated for the incidence of CIN. The relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the incidence of major adverse events, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, and target vessel revascularization, was investigated.\nThe incidence of CIN increased from 1.7% to 27.9%, depending on the quartile of baseline cystatin C level. Baseline serum cystatin C level (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.757; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.696-0.735) predicted the incidence of CIN better than baseline serum creatinine level (area under the curve, 0.629; 95% CI, 0.563-0.691; P < .001). An elevated baseline cystatin C level was an independent predictor of CIN (hazard ratio, 14.37; 95% CI, 4.11-50.19; P < .001) and major adverse events in patients with PAD (hazard ratio, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.28-5.17; P = .008).\nWe found elevated baseline cystatin C level to be an independent risk factor for CIN and a predictor of all-cause mortality and major adverse events in patients with PAD undergoing endovascular therapy.",

    "abstract": "Combined vascular reconstruction and free flap transfer has been established in centers as a feasible therapeutic option in cases with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and large tissue defects otherwise destined for major amputation. However, the number of patients treated with this combined approach is limited, and data regarding long-term follow-up and functional outcome are scarce. We therefore report our 10-year experience in free flap transplantation after vascular reconstruction as a last attempt for limb salvage, with special emphasis of complication rate, limb salvage, and postoperative mobility.\nCLI patients undergoing combined vascular reconstruction and consequent free flap transfer from 2003 to 2013 were retrospectively observed. Of 80 cases in total, patients with traumatic and oncologic indications were excluded; 33 (mean age, 66 years; range, 51-82 years) of these cases were performed for limb salvage and were included in this study. Long-term follow-up was possible in 32 of 33 patients (mean, 58 months; range, 2-126 months).\nThirty-three patients were analyzed. We performed arterial revascularization with 9 arteriovenous loops, 23 bypass grafts (10 popliteal-pedal, 9 femoral-crural, and 4 femoral-popliteal), and 1 venous interposition graft. For defect coverage, tissue transfer was comprised of six different flap entities (10 latissimus dorsi, 2 gracilis, 1 anterior lateral thigh, 7 rectus abdominis, 11 radialis, and 2 greater omentum flaps). Complications occurred in 16 of 33 patients (49%). Early complications included eight acute occlusions of arterial reconstructions; major bleedings were seen in eight patients as well. There were two flap losses and one major amputation in the early postoperative period. No in-hospital deaths were observed. Late results revealed a limb salvage rate of 87% after 1 year and 83% after 5 years. Amputation-free survival was 87% after 1 year and 75% after 5 years. Overall survival was 100% and 87% after 1 year and 5 years, respectively. Follow-up showed 42% of patients with no limitations in ambulation, 54% with maintained preoperative ambulatory status, and one bedridden patient.\nThe combined approach for limb salvage in CLI patients is associated with excellent results in limb salvage and functional outcome in patients who would otherwise be candidates for major amputation, despite an initially elevated complication rate. The option of combined revascularization with free tissue transfer should be evaluated in all mobile patients with CLI, large tissue defects, and exposed tendon or bone structures before major amputation. However, further studies are required to support these results.",

    "abstract": "Use of fluoroscopy and bone landmarks to guide percutaneous common femoral artery (CFA) access has decreased access site complications compared with palpation alone. However, only limited case series have examined the benefits of ultrasound to guide CFA access during peripheral vascular intervention (PVI). We evaluated the effect of routine vs selective use of ultrasound guidance (UG) on groin hematoma rates after PVI.\nThe Vascular Study Group of New England database (2010-2014) was queried to identify the complication of postprocedural groin hematoma after 7359 PVIs performed through CFA access. Hematoma (including pseudoaneurysms) was defined as minor (requiring compression or observation), moderate (requiring transfusion or thrombin injection), and major (requiring operation). Both procedure-level and interventionalist-level analyses were performed. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to compare hematoma rates of interventionalists based on routine (\u226580% of PVIs) and selective (<80%) utilization of UG in the adjusted overall sample and in multiple subgroups.\nThe overall postprocedural groin hematoma rate after PVI was 4.5%, and the rate of combined moderate and major hematoma was 0.8%. Among 114 interventionalists with \u226510 PVI procedures, routine and selective UG was used by 31 (27%) and 83 (73%) interventionalists, respectively. Routine UG was protective against hematoma (rate ratio [RR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.84; P < .01). Subgroup analysis revealed that routine UG was also protective against hematoma under the following circumstances: age >80 years (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.85; P = .01), body mass index \u226530 (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; P = .02), and sheath size >6F (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.79; P < .01).\nRoutine UG may potentially protect against the complication of hematoma for both modifiable and nonmodifiable patient and procedural characteristics. Encouraging routine UG is a feasible quality improvement opportunity to decrease patient morbidity after PVI.",

    "abstract": "We compared (1) cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammation, and apoptosis of cultured endothelial cells treated with sera and (2) circulating inflammatory measures, antioxidant capacity, vascular biomarkers, and calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO2) in men and women with peripheral artery disease (PAD). A secondary aim was to compare exercise performance and daily ambulatory activity between men and women. We hypothesized that women would have more impaired endothelial cellular ROS, inflammation, and apoptosis than men as well as worse systemic inflammation, antioxidant capacity, vascular biomarkers, calf muscle StO2, exercise performance, and daily ambulatory activity.\nThe 148 symptomatic men and women with PAD were characterized on the endothelial effects of circulating factors present in the sera by a cell culture-based bioassay on primary human arterial endothelial cells. Patients were further evaluated by circulating inflammatory and vascular biomarkers, physical examination and medical history, exercise performance, and calf muscle StO2 during exercise, and ambulatory activity was monitored during 1 week.\nCellular ROS production was higher in African American women than in men (P = .021), but there was no gender difference in white individuals (P = .537). Men and women were not significantly different on endothelial cell apoptosis (P = .833) and nuclear factor \u03baB activity (P = .465). For circulating factors, additional gender differences were found when comparisons were made within each race. In African Americans, women had higher intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (P = .022) and leptin (P < .001); whereas in white individuals, women had higher matrix metallopeptidase 9 (P = .047), higher vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (P = .047), and lower hepatocyte growth factor (P = .046). Overall, women had higher apolipoprotein CIII (P = .035), lower pain-free distance (P = .048) and total distance (P < .001) during the 6-minute walk test, shorter time for calf muscle StO2 to reach the minimum value during exercise (P = .027), and slower average cadence (P = .004) during daily ambulation.\nAfrican American women with symptomatic PAD have a heightened oxidative status, likely resulting in increased endothelial oxidative stress, compared with men. Furthermore, women exhibit a more pronounced proinflammatory profile of circulating biomarkers as well as more limited peripheral microcirculation, exercise performance, and ambulatory activity than men do. The clinical significance is that women with symptomatic PAD are in greater need than men of clinical intervention to improve oxidative stress, inflammation, and microcirculation, which may in turn have a favorable impact on their lower exercise performance and daily activity.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of aortic diseases, both aneurysmal and occlusive, is associated with the occurrence of local ischemic/hypoxic conditions, but the genetic factors that differentiate the predisposition to specific types of aortic diseases are largely unknown. In this study, the functional variants in genes involved in the hypoxia signaling pathway, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF1A) 1772C>T, 1790G>A, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) -634G>C, were analyzed in search of the associations specific to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development.\nThe study encompassed a series of 518 patients with AAA, 354 patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease, and 541 controls. In AAA patients, the occurrence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was examined with duplex arterial scanning. Genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method or with TaqMan probes.\nIn univariate analysis, a significantly increased risk for development of AAA without coexisting PAD was found in VEGFA -634C allele carriers (effect of allele dose: odds ratio [OR], 1.38; P = .012). In VEGFA -634CC homozygotes, the risk was enhanced by the interaction with HIF1A 1772CC-1790GG genotype (OR, 2.41; P = .008). This joint effect of homozygous genotypes also influenced the AAA risk independently of PAD coexistence (OR, 1.87; P = .036). In contrast, the minor allele of the HIF1A 1772C>T polymorphism (1772T and 1772T-1790G haplotype) was significantly associated with the occurrence of AAA with concomitant PAD (OR, 2.02; P = .009 for the dominant model). This effect was enhanced in the VEGF -634GG homozygotes (OR, 2.86; P = .005) and among smokers (OR, 3.10; P = .001). The individual effects of the HIF1A 1772 and VEGFA -634 polymorphisms on AAA risk remained significant in multivariable analysis after adjustment for the traditional vascular risk factors and analyzed polymorphisms. None of the studied variants influenced the risk of aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nThis study identifies polymorphisms in the HIF1A and VEGF genes as potential genetic markers that indicate the predisposition to either AAA coexisting with peripheral atherosclerosis or AAA without such lesions, suggesting the genetic heterogeneity of this disease. The HIF1A 1772T allele also seems to be a genetic risk factor that determines sensitivity to cigarette smoke exposure. Further work is needed to confirm the findings in an independent samples set and to study the functional role of studied variants in AAA.",

Previous studies suggest that AAA is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic background. This study evaluated the role of seven important functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AAA.\nThis was a case-control study of two independent populations: 397 AAA patients (mean aortic diameter, 6.2 \u00b1 1.4 cm) and 393 controls (mean diameter, 2.4 \u00b1 .2 cm) recruited from Greece (the main cohort), and 400 patients (mean diameter: 5.4 \u00b1 1 cm) and 400 controls (mean diameter, 2.4 \u00b1 .6 cm) recruited from the United Kingdom (replication cohort). The functional SNPs analyzed were rs3025058, rs3918242, rs2276109, rs1801133, rs1799752, rs1799983, and rs16874954. These regulate the following enzymes: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase or lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2.\nGenotype distributions (univariate analyses) did not differ significantly between cases and controls in the main or the replication cohort, with the exception of the MMP-3 rs3025058 SNP, where differences were borderline significant (odds ratio [OR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.97; P = .04) in the replication cohort. Adjusted analyses for age, sex, smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia disclosed no differences in either cohort. For SNPs that had previously been associated with AAA presence, meta-analysis of currently available data together with the two study cohorts disclosed positive associations for the MMP-3 rs3025058 (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = .0009) and MTHFR rs1801133 (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12; P = .0088).\nThe SNPs included in this analysis were not associated with AAA presence in either study population.

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is connected with abnormal extracellular matrix remodeling, with the assistance of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). A decrease in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) gene expression was detected in AAA patients. Recently, a -418 G/C (rs8179090) polymorphism of the TIMP2 gene promoter, influencing the transcription rate of the gene, has been described. This study investigated whether the -418 G/C gene polymorphism is associated with AAA in the Polish population.\nThe TIMP2 gene promoter polymorphism was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction enzyme analysis and pyrosequencing in 128 patients affected by AAA and in 180 individuals included as references. The control group was directly matched to patients according to known risk factors for vascular diseases.\nThe frequency of the C allele was significantly higher in AAA patients than in the control group (odds ratio [OR], 2.516; P = .0005). The distribution of genotypes also differed significantly between the groups (CC + CG vs GG: OR, 2.906; P = .0037) or was close to being significantly different (CC vs GG + GC: OR, 2.144; P = .0501). A similar trend was observed in men but not in women. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the TIMP2 gene promoter polymorphism is risk factor of AAA in the Polish population, with an adjusted OR of 4.99, when applied to a dominant inheritance model.\nOur study supports the hypothesis that TIMP2 and the -418G/C polymorphism located in the promoter of the TIMP2 gene are important in AAA pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Kissing stents (KS) are commonly used to treat aortoiliac occlusive disease, but patency results are often lower than those of isolated stents. The Covered Endovascular Reconstruction of the Aortic Bifurcation (CERAB) technique was recently introduced to reconstruct the aortic bifurcation in a more anatomical and physiological fashion. The aim of this study is to compare the geometrical consequences of various stent configurations in vitro.\nAnatomic vessel phantoms of the aortoiliac bifurcation were created to accommodate stent configurations. Self-expandable nitinol KS, balloon-expandable covered KS, and two versions of the CERAB configuration were deployed, one with the iliac legs positioned inside the tapered part of the aortic cuff (1) and one with the legs deployed above this level (2). Computed tomography data were obtained to assess the geometry. The conformation ratio (D-ratio) was calculated by use of the ratio of the major and minor axes. The proximal mismatch area, mean mismatch area, and total mismatch volume were calculated.\nThe highest D-ratios were observed in the nitinol KS and the CERAB configuration, implying an ideal \"double-D\" shape. The proximal and mean mismatch areas were four- to sixfold lower in the CERAB (1) configuration when compared with nitinol KS and CERAB (2), respectively, whereas the covered KS had the highest mismatch area. Nitinol and covered KS had the largest mismatch volume, whereas the mismatch volume was the lowest in the CERAB (1) configuration.\nAlthough nitinol self-expandable stents have a high stent conformation, the lowest radial mismatch was found in the CERAB (1) configuration, supporting the hypothesis that the CERAB configuration is the most anatomical and physiological reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation. Within the CERAB configuration, the two limbs are ideally positioned inside the tapering portion of the cuff, minimizing mismatch.",

Type B aortic dissections were surgically initiated 2 cm below the left subclavian artery. Aortas were thereafter connected to a bench top pulsatile flow to induce propagation of the dissection. A 5-mm 30\u00b0 lens (Richard Wolf, Vernon Hills, Ill) was introduced successively into the false lumen and the true lumen to monitor the propagation of the dissection. Bare-metal stents were deployed into the true lumen from the primary entry tear to the infrarenal aorta. Measurement of systolic pressure was taken within the abdominal branch vessels before and after stenting. A pressure gradient drop of 15 mm Hg or more after bare-metal stenting was considered hemodynamically relevant.\nDissection was propagated at least to the renal aorta in 11 cases (73%) and to the infrarenal aorta in 3 cases (20%). Of the 60 abdominal branch vessels studied, 22 (36.7%) were supplied by the false lumen. After extensive aortic bare-metal stenting, complete reattachment of the dissection flap was observed in all cases. Regarding visceral and renal artery patency after bare-metal stenting, a significant pressure gradient drop was reported in 54.5% (n = 12) when these arteries were supplied by the false lumen, whereas those originating from the true lumen had a significantly less common pressure gradient drop (7.9% [n = 3]; P < .0001).\nBare-metal stenting in this model of acute type B aortic dissection was effective in true lumen reexpansion but induced a high (54.5%) rate of significant pressure drop in the visceral and renal arteries when they were supplied by the false lumen.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive measurement of peripheral muscle microperfusion could potentially improve diagnosis, management, and treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and thus improve patient care. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as a noninvasive diagnostic tool allows quantification of muscle perfusion. Increasing data on bolus technique CEUS reflecting microperfusion are becoming available, but only limited data on steady-state CEUS for assessment of muscle microperfusion are available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate steady-state CEUS for assessment of peripheral muscle microperfusion in a PAD animal model.\nIn a porcine animal model, peripheral muscle microperfusion was quantified by steady-state CEUS replenishment kinetics (mean transit time [mTT] and wash-in rate [WiR]) of the biceps femoris muscle during intravenous steady-state infusion of INN-sulfur hexafluoride (SonoVue; Bracco, Geneva, Switzerland). In addition, macroperfusion was quantified at the external femoral artery with a Doppler flow probe. Peripheral muscle microperfusion and Doppler flow measurements were performed bilaterally at rest and under adenosine stress (70 \u03bcg/kg body weight) before and after unilateral creation of a moderate external iliac artery stenosis.\nAll measurements could be performed completely in 10 pigs. Compared with baseline measurements, peripheral muscle microperfusion decreased significantly during adenosine stress (rest vs adenosine stress: mTT, 7.8 \u00b1 3.3 vs 21.2 \u00b1 17.8 s, P = .0006; WiR, 58.4 \u00b1 38.1 vs 25.3 \u00b1 15.6 arbitrary units [a.u.]/s, P < .0001; Doppler flow, 122.3 \u00b1 31.4 vs 83.6 \u00b1 28.1 mL/min, P = .0067) and after stenosis creation (no stenosis vs stenosis: mTT, 8.1 \u00b1 3.1 vs 29.2 \u00b1 18.0 s, P = .0469; WiR, 53.0 \u00b1 22.7 vs 13.6 \u00b1 8.4 a.u./s, P = .0156; Doppler flow, 124.2 \u00b1 41.8 vs 65.9 \u00b1 40.0 mL/min, P = .0313). After stenosis creation, adenosine stress led to a further significant decrease of peripheral muscle microperfusion but had no effect on macroperfusion (mTT, 29.2 \u00b1 18.0 vs 56.3 \u00b1 38.7 s, P = .0078; WiR, 13.6 \u00b1 8.4 vs 6.0 \u00b1 4.1 a.u./s, P = .0078; Doppler flow, 65.9 \u00b1 40.0 vs 79.2 \u00b1 29.6 mL/min, P = .8125). Receiver operating characteristic curves for the presence of inflow stenosis showed an excellent area under the curve of 0.93 for mTT at rest and 0.86 for Doppler flow.\nPeripheral muscle microperfusion measurement by steady-state CEUS with replenishment kinetics is feasible and allows detection of muscle microperfusion changes caused by vasodilative stress alone or in combination with a moderate inflow stenosis. Steady-state CEUS offers superior diagnostic performance compared with Doppler flow measurements. Therefore, steady-state CEUS may prove to be a useful tool in diagnosis of PAD and for evaluation of new therapies.",

    "abstract": "Infected abdominal aortic disease and graft infections pose a significant challenge for the vascular surgeon. Thorough radical d\u00e9bridement, either preceded by extra-anatomic bypass or followed by in situ aortic replacement, is the mainstay of treatment. The role of endovascular repair by stent grafts is being increasingly described but is limited to relatively less virulent mycotic aneurysms or as a \"bridging\" option in sick patients with florid sepsis that necessitates eventual delayed definitive surgical management. Autologous femoral vein has been an excellent conduit for aortic bifurcation reconstruction in this setting. Although various configurations of femoral vein conduit have been described for aortobi-iliac reconstruction, an in-depth knowledge of the venous anatomy, physiology, mechanisms of \"profundization,\" and techniques of harvest and graft preparation is essential for efficient conduct of the operation and its optimal outcomes. We review in detail these aspects of \"pantaloon\" femoral vein graft creation as a \"neoaorta\".",

    "abstract": "Degenerative hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) are an uncommon pathologic process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the approach to and outcomes of operative management of HAA with open techniques (OTs) and endovascular techniques (ETs).\nTwenty-one patients who underwent intervention for HAA from January 1, 1992, to January 30, 2015, at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patient presentation, risk factors, and operative approach were reviewed. The primary outcome was operative morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes included long-term survival, patency, and need for reintervention.\nOf the 21 patients, 14 (67%) were men. The mean age of all patients was 66 years (range, 30-85 years), with a mean HAA size of 45 \u00b1 28 mm (12 common hepatic, 5 common and proper hepatic, 3 right hepatic, and 1 accessory left hepatic). Nine patients (43%) had connective tissue disorders. More than half of the patients (63%) had synchronous aneurysms (29% in the aorta, 24% in the splenic and iliac arteries, and 10% in the celiac arteries). Ten patients (48%) were asymptomatic. Right upper quadrant pain was the most common symptom at presentation (43%), followed by transaminitis (5%) and obstructive jaundice (5%). Five patients (24%) presented with rupture (size, 15-40 mm). OT was performed in 17 patients; 4 patients had ET. Fourteen patients (67%) underwent open reconstruction of the common hepatic (n = 10), the common and proper hepatic (n = 2), and the right and left accessory hepatic arteries (n = 1 each). Seven bypasses were performed with saphenous vein, six with Dacron, and one with polytetrafluoroethylene. Endoaneurysmorrhaphy alone, patch, and ligation were performed in one instance each. Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (29%), including hemorrhage, graft thrombosis, common bile duct stricture that required reoperation, duodenal perforation, and enterocutaneous fistula. ET was attempted in five patients; coil embolization was performed in four patients (two of the common and two of the right hepatic arteries). Overall mortality was 14% (6% after elective OT, 40% for emergency OT, 0% for ET). Mean follow-up was 32 \u00b1 46 months. Overall survival was 86% at 5 years. Primary and secondary graft patency was 86% at 5 years. One patient underwent reintervention because of occlusion of saphenous vein graft.\nOpen repair remains the mainstay treatment for degenerative HAA repairs to preserve arterial flow to the liver, with notable morbidity and mortality, particularly in the setting of rupture. However, coil embolization may be applied safely in select patients with aneurysms not involving the proper hepatic artery if adequate collateral circulation ensures hepatic perfusion.",

Nine patients (43%) had connective tissue disorders. More than half of the patients (63%) had synchronous aneurysms (29% in the aorta, 24% in the splenic and iliac arteries, and 10% in the celiac arteries). Ten patients (48%) were asymptomatic. Right upper quadrant pain was the most common symptom at presentation (43%), followed by transaminitis (5%) and obstructive jaundice (5%). Five patients (24%) presented with rupture (size, 15-40 mm). OT was performed in 17 patients; 4 patients had ET. Fourteen patients (67%) underwent open reconstruction of the common hepatic (n = 10), the common and proper hepatic (n = 2), and the right and left accessory hepatic arteries (n = 1 each). Seven bypasses were performed with saphenous vein, six with Dacron, and one with polytetrafluoroethylene. Endoaneurysmorrhaphy alone, patch, and ligation were performed in one instance each. Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (29%), including hemorrhage, graft thrombosis, common bile duct stricture that required reoperation, duodenal perforation, and enterocutaneous fistula. ET was attempted in five patients; coil embolization was performed in four patients (two of the common and two of the right hepatic arteries). Overall mortality was 14% (6% after elective OT, 40% for emergency OT, 0% for ET). Mean follow-up was 32 \u00b1 46 months. Overall survival was 86% at 5 years. Primary and secondary graft patency was 86% at 5 years. One patient underwent reintervention because of occlusion of saphenous vein graft.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the early and late 7-year experience with the Endurant bifurcated stent graft system (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nBetween November 14, 2007, and December 2013, 712 consecutive high-risk patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent elective or urgent placement of an Endurant bifurcated endograft in our institution. The included patients were consecutive (all comers) and treated independently from their morphologic eligibility for use of the Endurant device based on the instructions for use. The primary study outcome was freedom from all-cause reintervention.\nThe median follow-up was 19.2 months (interquartile range, 6.3-35.9 months). Overall, 517 patients (72.6%) were treated on the basis of instructions for use conditions. On the other hand, 195 patients (27.4%) had morphologic data not consistent with the recommendations for the use of the Endurant system. The 30-day mortality was 1.4% (10 of 712). Nine patients (1.2%) were lost to follow-up because of relocation abroad. The overall mortality rate was 14.74% (101 of 703). Overall survival rate was 92.3% at 1 year, 86.4% at 2 years, and 65% at 5 years. Overall freedom from reintervention rate was 93.3%, 86.4%, and 65% at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. Five patients (0.7%) underwent a surgical conversion and explantation of the Endurant device. The reasons were endograft infection (n = 1), endoleak type Ia (n = 1), endoleak type II (n = 1), endograft and limb thrombotic occlusion (n = 1), and endotension (n = 1). The overall iliac limb occlusion rate was 2.1% (15 of 712).\nThe performance of the Endurant stent graft during a period of 7 years under real-life conditions was good, with low incidence of reinterventions and endoleaks.",

All patients were treated between January 2009 and November 2014 by use of parallel grafts, ie, chimney/snorkel or periscope grafts and abdominal endovascular devices. Primary outcome of the study was the technical success. Secondary outcomes were patency of the chimney grafts and shrinkage of aneurysm morphology.\nTechnical success was 94.4% (17 of 18). One patient showed evidence of persistent type Ia endoleak after triple chimney graft placement and treated by Onyx embolization (Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) successfully. The mean preoperative and postoperative aneurysm diameters were 7.1 \u00b1 1.7 and 7.0 \u00b1 2 cm. Primary patency of the chimney grafts was 96.7% and assisted patency was 100% after successful retrograde recanalization of an acute occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery from the celiac trunk and the gastroduodenal artery. One patient who had undergone the sandwich technique with transfemoral placement of the flexible Viabahn (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) due to impossible catheterization of the target vessel from the upper extremity presented with contained rupture caused by gutter-associated endoleak and underwent urgent embolization with Onyx successfully. No procedure-related death or open conversion was observed in the entire follow-up period.\nUse of parallel grafts showed midterm safety and feasibility with low incidence of persistent endoleaks requiring intervention or progression of aneurysm diameter. Reproducible results from other vascular centers will establish the chimney technique in the treatment of type I endoleaks as a viable endovascular modality.",

    "abstract": "Patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissections who are managed medically are at risk of aortic aneurysmal degeneration over time. However, the effect of improvement in antihypertensive medications and stricter blood pressure control is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the rate of aneurysmal degeneration in a contemporary cohort of patients with medically treated type B dissection.\nIncluded were all patients with acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection who were initially managed medically between March 1999 and March 2011 and had follow-up axial imaging studies. Maximum aortic growth was calculated by comparing the initial imaging study to the most current scan or imaging obtained just before any aortic-related intervention. An increase of \u22655 mm was the threshold considered as aortic growth. Predictors of aortic aneurysmal degeneration were determined using Cox proportional hazards models.\nWe identified 200 patients (61% men) with medically managed acute type B dissections receiving multiple imaging studies. Patients were an average age of 63.4 years, and 75.5% had a history of hypertension. Mean follow-up was 5.3 years (range, 0.1-14.7 years). Mean time between the initial and final imaging studies was 3.2 years (range, 0.1-12.9 years). At 5 years, only 51% were free from aortic growth. Fifty-six patients (28%) required operative intervention (50 open, 6 endovascular repair) for aneurysmal degeneration, and the actuarial 5-year freedom from intervention was 76%. After excluding five patients (2.5%) with early rapid degeneration requiring intervention within the first 2 weeks, the mean rate of aortic growth was 12.3 mm/y for the total aortic diameter, 3.8 mm/y for the true lumen diameter, and 8.6 mm/y for the false lumen diameter. Only aortic diameter at index presentation >3.5 cm was a risk factor for future growth (odds ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-4.81; P < .01). Complete thrombosis of the false lumen was protective against growth (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.42; P < .01).\nAlthough medical management of uncomplicated acute, type B aortic dissections has been the standard of care, at 5 years, a significant number of patients will require operative intervention for aneurysmal degeneration. Further studies of early intervention (eg, thoracic endovascular aortic repair) for type B aortic dissection to prevent late aneurysm formation are needed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential feasibility and financial impact of same-day discharge after elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nAll elective EVARs performed between January 2012 and June 2013 were identified. Demographics, comorbidities, complications, nursing care, financial data, and length of stay were analyzed.\nSixty-seven (73%) EVARs were performed electively, 73% percutaneously. Intraoperative complications were blood loss requiring transfusion (4.5%), thrombosis (3%), femoral artery injury (1.5%), postoperative urinary retention (4.5%), myocardial infarction (3%), respiratory failure (1.5%), congestive heart failure (1.5%), and hemodynamic or rhythm alterations (37%; evident in 88% <6 hours; 13% required therapy). Monitoring only was needed in 28 patients (42%), intensive care in 15%. Seventy-two percent were discharged on postoperative day one; 6% were readmitted <30 days. Telemetry, oxygen, intravenous hydration, and urinary catheters (routine services) were used for shorter periods in uncomplicated patients and those discharged on postoperative day 1. Total hospital costs were $29,479: operating room, 80.3%; anesthesia, 2.2%; preadmission, 1%; postanesthesia unit, 3.1%; intensive care unit, 1.9%; floor, 4.7%; laboratory and diagnostic tests, 1.2%; pharmacy, 1.4%; other, 4.2%. Total cost was similar for those discharged <20 hours or \u226524 to 31 hours postoperatively (P = .51) and for monitoring only vs others ($28,146 vs $30,545; P = .12). Pharmacy ($351 vs $509; P = .05), laboratory work ($86 vs $355; P = .01), and diagnostic testing ($4 vs $254; P = .02) costs were lower for uncomplicated cases.\nSame-day discharge is clinically feasible in >40% of elective EVARs but requires coordination for adequate postoperative monitoring. Significant savings are unlikely as most cost is operating room and device related, and further reduction of costs in uncomplicated cases is unlikely.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) reportedly has an antioxidant effect through superoxide dismutase (SOD) activation. However, the effect of riboflavin on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has never been investigated. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that riboflavin has a protective effect on AAA formation in an experimental rat model.\nThe AAA model, which was induced with intraluminal elastase and extraluminal calcium chloride, was created in 36 rats. The 36 rats were divided into a riboflavin group (group R; 25\u00a0mg/kg/d), and control group (carboxymethyl cellulose). Riboflavin administration by gastric gavage once per day was started at 3\u00a0days before aneurysm preparation. On day 3, SOD activity in aneurysm walls was assayed. On day 7, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were semiquantified by dihydroethidium staining, and the oxidation product of DNA produced by ROS, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), was measured by immunohistochemical staining. Histopathologic examination (hematoxylin/eosin and elastica Van Gieson staining) was performed on day 28, and the AAA dilatation ratio was calculated to evaluate the protective effect of riboflavin.\nOn day 3, SOD activity was significantly increased in aneurysm walls by riboflavin administration (370\u00a0\u00b1 204 U/mL in normal, 334\u00a0\u00b1 86 U/mL in control, 546\u00a0\u00b1 143 U/mL in group R; P\u00a0= .021). On day 7, ROS levels and 8-OHdG-positive cells in aneurysm walls were significantly decreased by riboflavin treatment (ROS levels: 1.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.1 in normal, 4.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.4 in control, 3.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.5 in group R, P\u00a0< .01; 8-OHdG-positive cells: 30\u00a0\u00b1 2 cells in normal, 148\u00a0\u00b1 20 cells in control, 109\u00a0\u00b1 15 cells in group R, P\u00a0< .01). Riboflavin treatment significantly reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 messenger RNA expression in aneurysm walls (relative expression: MMP-9: 0.4\u00a0\u00b1 0.7 in normal, 2.6\u00a0\u00b1 1.3 in control, 0.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.3 in group R, P\u00a0< .01). On day 28, the aortic walls were less dilated and had higher elastin content in group R than in control (dilatation ratio: 194.9%\u00a0\u00b1 10.9% in control, 158.6%\u00a0\u00b1 2.5% in group R; P\u00a0<.01).\nRiboflavin treatment prevents AAA formation in a rat model through an antioxidant effect and might be a potent pharmacologic agent for AAA treatment in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an established operation performed to prevent strokes, but its other potential effects, such as improving neurocognitive, visual, and auditory functions, remain unconfirmed. This study examined these effects of CEA on patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nThis was a prospective controlled study that included 80 patients with minor strokes who had severe extracranial internal carotid stenoses (>70%). Forty patients, who did not receive or who postponed the CEA due to concerns about age, fear of surgery, limited life expectancy because of cancer, or financial problems, formed the medicine-treatment group. Another 40 patients who received CEA 1 week after recruitment formed the CEA group. For both groups, visual acuity chart tests, perimetry tests, audiometry tests, and neurologic scales (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Mini Mental State Examination, and Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living) were used to assess ophthalmic functions, auditory acuity, and neurocognitive functions before treatment and 3 months after treatment. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons were conducted to examine the effect of CEA.\nNo deaths or strokes occurred during the 3-month follow-up. The intragroup and intergroup comparisons of ipsilateral function showed that CEA could improve visual acuity, visual field, and auditory acuity at all tested frequencies (250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz) and could improve the visual field and the auditory acuity for contralateral functions at 1000 Hz. The auditory acuity at 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz were unchanged in the intragroup comparison but showed no deterioration in the intergroup comparison with the medicine group. General neurocognitive function and independent living ability were significantly improved by CEA, as shown by intergroup comparisons (change rate of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: -8.1% \u00b1 9.0% vs -2.7% \u00b1 3.0%, P < .001; change rate of Mini Mental State Examination: 15.5% \u00b1 10.5% vs 1.6% \u00b1 2.6%, P < .001; change rate of Barthel Index: 28.0% \u00b1 24.6% vs 2.0% \u00b1 5.5%, P < .001).\nIn patients with minor strokes caused by severe carotid stenosis, CEA improves neurocognitive, ophthalmic, and acoustic functions. Studies with a larger sample and longer follow-up are needed to substantiate these results, and the underlying mechanisms need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The volume and complexity of endovascular procedures are increasing. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) made precise three-dimensional (3D) planning of these procedures possible, but intraoperative imaging, even with the use of modern flat-panel detectors, is limited to two dimensions. Flat detectors, however, allow C-arm cone-beam CT. This technology can be used to generate a 3D data set that can be fused with a preoperative high-resolution CT scan, thus generating a live 3D roadmap. We hypothesized that use of a novel image fusion software, VesselNavigator (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), facilitates precise and expeditious procedures and therefore reduces radiation exposure and contrast agent dose.\nA retrospective review of patients undergoing standard aortobi-iliac endovascular aneurysm repair at our institution between January 2011 and April 2014 was performed. Conventional imaging was compared with VesselNavigator-assisted imaging, and a matched analysis based on body mass index (BMI) was performed because of the dependence of radiation dose on body habitus. Outcome parameters were procedure time, fluoroscopy time, radiation, and contrast agent dose.\nA total of 75 patients were identified. After matching based on BMI, control and VesselNavigator groups each had 16 patients with BMI of 27.0 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m(2) and 27.0 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m(2), respectively (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). R(2) was 6.37 \u00d7 10(-7). Radiation dose measured as air kerma was lower with VesselNavigator (1067 \u00b1 470.4 mGy vs 1768 \u00b1 696.2 mGy; P = .004). Fluoroscopy time was shorter (18.4 \u00b1 6.8 minutes vs 26.8 \u00b1 10.0 minutes; P = .01) and contrast agent dose was lower (37.4 \u00b1 21.3 mL vs 77.3 \u00b1 23.0 mL; P < .001) with VesselNavigator compared with control. Procedure time was also shorter with VesselNavigator (80.4 \u00b1 21.2 minutes vs 110.0 \u00b1 29.1 minutes; P = .005).\nImage fusion using VesselNavigator enhances the functionality of conventional fluoroscopy in standard endovascular aneurysm repair. It reduces radiation exposure to patients and providers. It also limits the amount of contrast agent and shortens the overall procedure length. The benefit of this technology is demonstrated on this typically straightforward procedure but may be even more useful for complex procedures.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is among the most common procedures performed in the United States. However, consensus is lacking regarding optimal preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and ultimately, the threshold for surgery. We sought to characterize national variation in preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and threshold for surgery for asymptomatic CEA.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database was used to identify all CEA procedures performed for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis between 2003 and 2014. VQI currently captures 100% of CEA procedures performed at >300 centers by >2000 physicians nationwide. Three analyses were performed to quantify the variation in (1) preoperative imaging, (2) carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and (3) threshold for surgery.\nOf 35,695 CEA procedures in 33,488 patients, the study cohort was limited to 19,610 CEA procedures (55%) performed for asymptomatic disease. The preoperative imaging modality used before CEA varied widely, with 57% of patients receiving a single preoperative imaging study (duplex ultrasound imaging, 46%; computed tomography angiography, 7.5%; magnetic resonance angiography, 2.0%; cerebral angiography, 1.3%) and 43% of patients receiving multiple preoperative imaging studies. Of the 16,452 asymptomatic patients (89%) who underwent preoperative duplex ultrasound imaging, there was significant variability between centers in the degree of stenosis (50%-69%, 70%-79%, 80%-99%) designated for a given peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, and internal carotid artery-to-common carotid artery ratio. Although 68% of CEA procedures in asymptomatic patients were performed for an 80% to 99% stenosis, 26% were performed for a 70% to 79% stenosis, and 4.1% were performed for a 50% to 69% stenosis. At the surgeon level, the range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is from 0% to 100%. Similarly, at the center level, institutions range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 0% to 100%.\nDespite CEA being an extremely common procedure, there is widespread variation in the three primary determinants-preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and threshold for surgery-of whether CEA is performed for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Standardizing the approach to care for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis will mitigate the significant downstream effects of this variation on health care costs.",

The preoperative imaging modality used before CEA varied widely, with 57% of patients receiving a single preoperative imaging study (duplex ultrasound imaging, 46%; computed tomography angiography, 7.5%; magnetic resonance angiography, 2.0%; cerebral angiography, 1.3%) and 43% of patients receiving multiple preoperative imaging studies. Of the 16,452 asymptomatic patients (89%) who underwent preoperative duplex ultrasound imaging, there was significant variability between centers in the degree of stenosis (50%-69%, 70%-79%, 80%-99%) designated for a given peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, and internal carotid artery-to-common carotid artery ratio. Although 68% of CEA procedures in asymptomatic patients were performed for an 80% to 99% stenosis, 26% were performed for a 70% to 79% stenosis, and 4.1% were performed for a 50% to 69% stenosis. At the surgeon level, the range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is from 0% to 100%. Similarly, at the center level, institutions range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 0% to 100%.",

    "abstract": "Heart rate (HR) parameters are known indicators of cardiovascular complications after cardiac surgery, but there is little evidence of their role in predicting outcome after major vascular surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether arrival HR (AHR) and highest intraoperative HR are associated with mortality or major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) after elective vascular surgery in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI).\nPatients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass (LEB), aortofemoral bypass (AFB), and open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the VQI were analyzed. MACE was defined as any postoperative myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. Controlled HR was defined as AHR <75 beats/min on operating room arrival. Delta HR (DHR) was defined as highest intraoperative HR - AHR. Procedure-specific MACE models were derived for risk stratification, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustering of center effects. HR, beta-blocker exposure, cardiac risk, and their interactions were explored to determine association with MACE or 30-day mortality. A Bonferroni correction with P < .004 was used to declare significance.\nThere were 13,291 patients reviewed (LEB, n = 8155 [62%]; AFB, n = 2629 [18%]; open AAA, n = 2629 [20%]). Rates of any preoperative beta-blocker exposure were as follows: LEB, 66.5% (n = 5412); AFB, 57% (n = 1342); and open AAA, 74.2% (n = 1949). AHR and DHR outcome association was variable across patients and procedures. AHR <75 beats/min was associated with increased postoperative myocardial infarction risk for LEB patients across all risk strata (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.9; P = .03), whereas AHR <75 beats/min was associated with decreased dysrhythmia risk (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28-0.63; P = .0001) and 30-day death (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33-0.77; P = .001) in patients at moderate and high cardiac risk. These HR associations disappeared in controlling for beta-blocker status. For AFB and open AAA repair patients, there was no significant association between AHR and MACE or 30-day mortality, irrespective or cardiac risk or beta-blocker status. DHR and extremes of highest intraoperative HR (>90 or 100 beats/min) were analyzed among all three operations, and no consistent associations with MACE or 30-day mortality were detected.\nThe VQI AHR and highest intraoperative HR variables are highly confounded by patient presentation, operative variables, and beta-blocker therapy. The discordance between cardiac risk and HR as well as the lack of consistent correlation to outcome makes them unreliable predictors. The VQI has elected to discontinue collecting AHR and highest intraoperative HR data, given insufficient evidence to suggest their importance as an outcome measure.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable controversy about the significance and appropriate treatment of type II endoleaks (T2Ls) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We report our long-term experience with T2L management in a large multicenter registry.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, 1736 patients underwent EVAR, and we recorded the incidence of T2L. Primary outcomes were mortality and aneurysm-related mortality (ARM). Secondary outcomes were change in aneurysm sac size, major adverse events, and reintervention.\nDuring the follow-up (median of 32.2 months; interquartile range, 14.2-52.8 months), T2L was identified in 474 patients (27.3%). There were no late abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures attributable to a T2L. Overall mortality (P = .47) and ARM (P = .26) did not differ between patients with and without T2L. Sac growth (median, 5 mm; interquartile range, 2-10 mm) was seen in 213 (44.9%) of the patients with T2L. Of these patients with a T2L and sac growth, 36 (16.9%) had an additional type of endoleak. Of all patients with T2L, 111 (23.4%) received reinterventions, including 39 patients who underwent multiple procedures; 74% of the reinterventions were performed in patients with sac growth. Reinterventions included lumbar embolization in 66 patients (59.5%), placement of additional stents in 48 (43.2%), open surgical revision in 14 (12.6%), and direct sac injection in 22 (19.8%). The reintervention was successful in 35 patients (31.5%). After patients with other types of endoleak were excluded, no difference in overall all-cause mortality (P = .57) or ARM (P = .09) was observed between patients with T2L-associated sac growth who underwent reintervention and those in whom T2L was left untreated.\nIn our multicenter EVAR registry, overall all-cause mortality and ARM were unaffected by the presence of a T2L. Moreover, patients who were simply observed for T2L-associated sac growth had aneurysm-related outcomes similar to those in patients who underwent reintervention. Our future work will investigate the most cost-effective ways to select patients for intervention besides sac growth alone.",

Clinical state in Rutherford category, ankle-brachial indexes, and duplex ultrasound scans were the features of follow-up at 6 weeks and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Primary end points of the study were the 3-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates.\nA total of 73 SFAs in 70 patients were treated with a heparin-bonded Viabahn and included in the study.

    "abstract": "Mechanical assist devices have found an increasingly important role in high-risk interventional cardiac procedures. The Impella (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, Mass) is a percutaneous left ventricular assist device inserted through the femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance and positioned in the left ventricular cavity. This study was undertaken to assess the incidence of vascular complications and associated morbidity and mortality that can occur with Impella placement.\nWe used a prospective database to review patients who underwent placement of an Impella left ventricular assist device in our tertiary referral center from July 2010 to December 2013. Patient demographics, comorbidities, interventional complications, and 30-day mortality were recorded.\nThe study included 90 patients (60% male). Mean age was 66 years (range, 17-97 years). Hypertension was found in 69% of the patients, 37% were diabetic, 57% had a history of tobacco abuse, and 65% had chronic renal insufficiency. The median preprocedure cardiac ejection fraction was 30%. Most (87%) had undergone coronary artery intervention. Cardiogenic shock was documented in 67 patients (74%). The Impella was placed for an average of 1 day (range, 0-5 days). At least one vascular complication occurred in 15 patients (17%). Acute limb ischemia occurred in 12 patients; of whom four required an amputation and six required open or endovascular surgery. Other complications included groin hematomas and one pseudoaneurysm. All-patient 30-day mortality was 50%, which was not significantly associated with vascular complications. Female sex and cardiogenic shock at the time of insertion were associated with vascular complications (P = .043 and P = .018, respectfully).\nVascular complications are common with placement of the Impella percutaneous left ventricular assist device (17%) and are related to emergency procedures. Vascular complications in this high-risk patient population frequently lead to withdrawal of care. These data provide quality improvement targets for left ventricular assist device programs.",

    "abstract": "The Stenting with Angioplasty and Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial compared carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to carotid artery stenting (CAS) among high-risk patients using a model of risk that has not been validated by previous publications. The objective of our study was to determine the accuracy of this high-risk model and to determine the true risk factors that result in patients being at high risk for CEA.\nProspectively collected data for 3098 CEAs between 2003 and 2011 at 20 Vascular Surgery Group of New England (VSGNE) centers were used. SAPPHIRE general inclusion criteria and primary outcomes were assessed. Factors that were associated with the primary outcome by analysis of variance (P < .10) and not linearly dependent, as determined by a Pearson correlation analysis, were further assessed for an independent association by multivariate logistic regression. A risk index model was developed for these significant predictors to accurately define high-risk CEA.\nThe average patient age was 69.9 \u00b1 9.5 years, 60% were male, and 45.7% were asymptomatic. The 1-year composite outcome event rate, defined as postoperative myocardial infarction and stroke or death, was 14.2%. Multivariate analysis (P < .05) found the following independently significant risk factors: age in years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.1; P < .001), preadmission living in a nursing home (95% CI, 1.2-6.6; P = .020), congestive heart failure (95% CI, 1.4-2.8; P < .001), diabetes mellitus (DM; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3; P < .001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (95% CI, 1.2-1.5; P < .001), any previous cerebrovascular disease (95% CI, 1.1-1.9; P = .003), and contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis (95% CI, 1.0-1.2; P = .001). Three of the SAPPHIRE high-risk criteria-abnormal stress test, recurrent stenosis after CEA, and previous radiotherapy to the neck-were not independently associated with an adverse outcome. Independently significant risk factors not included in the SAPPHIRE criteria are inclusion of ages <80 years, preadmission living in a nursing home, DM, contralateral carotid stenosis, and any previous cerebrovascular accident. The risk index predictors are age in years (40-49: 0 points; 50-59: 2 points; 60-69: 4 points; 70-79: 6 points; 80-89: 8 points), living in a nursing home (4 points), any cardiovascular disease (2 points), congestive heart failure (5 points), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3 points), DM (2 points), degree of contralateral stenosis (<50%: 0 points; 50%-69%: 1 point; 70%-near occlusion: 2 points; occlusion: 3 points). High-risk CEA is defined as >13 points, representing adverse outcome rate of 22.5%.\nSAPPHIRE and other previously reported high-risk CAS inclusion criteria do not include all of the factors found to be independently associated with outcomes. Further studies are required to determine whether CAS is inferior to CEA in high-risk patients using a validated model of risk. In addition, this preoperative assessment includes novel criteria that can be used to stratify risks.",

    "abstract": "Effective treatments against restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting are largely lacking. Human tissue kallikrein gene transfer has been shown to be able to attenuate neointima formation induced by balloon catheter. As a tissue kallikrein in\u00a0vivo, human urinary kininogenase (HUK) is widely used to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the effects of HUK on neointima formation have not been explored. We therefore investigated whether HUK could alleviate balloon catheter-induced intimal hyperplasia in rabbits fed with high-fat diets.\nThe effects of HUK on neointima and atherosclerosis formation were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining in balloon-injured carotid arteries of rabbits. Local inflammatory response was evaluated by detecting the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 1\u03b2 with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction plus the invasion of macrophages with immunohistochemical staining. Western blotting was employed to investigate the effects of HUK on activities of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and Smad signaling pathway. The long-term effect of HUK on intimal hyperplasia of the injured carotid artery was assessed by angiography.\nQuantitative image analysis showed that intravenous administration of HUK for 14\u00a0days significantly decreased the intimal areas and intima area/media area ratios (day 14, 54% decrease in intimal area and 58% decrease in intima area/media area ratios; day 28, 63% and 85%). Significant decreases were also noted in macrophage foam cell-positive area after 7-day or 14-day administration of HUK (day 7, 69% decrease in intimal area and 78% decrease in media area; day 14, 79% and 60%; day 28, 68% and 44%). Actin staining for smooth muscle cells in neointima at 2\u00a0months showed similar results (vascular smooth muscle cell-positive area of neointima, 28.21%\u00a0\u00b1 5.58% vs 43.78%\u00a0\u00b1 8.36%; P\u00a0< .05). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analysis showed that HUK reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin 1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b21, and p-Smad2/3 but increased the expression of p-eNOS. Angiography analysis showed that 14-day administration of HUK significantly decreased the degree of stenosis (26.8%\u00a0\u00b1 7.1% vs 47.9%\u00a0\u00b1 5.7%; P\u00a0< .01) at 2\u00a0months after balloon injury.\nOur results indicate that HUK is able to attenuate atherosclerosis formation and to inhibit intimal hyperplasia by downregulating TGF-\u03b21 expression and Smad2/3 phosphorylation, upregulating eNOS activity. HUK may be a potential therapeutic agent to prevent stenosis after vascular injury.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for acute complicated type B aortic dissection (AD) promotes early positive aortic remodeling. However, little is known about the long-term effect of TEVAR on the dissected aorta, which is the goal of this study.\nBetween August 2005 and August 2009, 31 patients with complicated type B AD were treated with TEVAR and had >1-year follow-up imaging. Computed tomography angiograms obtained at 1 month, 1 year, and long term (average, 42 months) were compared with baseline scans. The largest diameters of the stented thoracic aorta, stented true lumen, and stented false lumen were recorded at each time point, as were the values in the unstented distal thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta. Changes over time were evaluated by a mixed effect analysis of variance model of repeated measures.\nThe average age of the cohort was 56 years, and 74% were male. Indications for TEVAR were as follows: 61% malperfusion, 32% refractory hypertension, 45% impending rupture, and 32% persistent pain; 58% had more than one indication. All patients were treated in the acute phase within 7 days of the initial presentation. The average length of aorta covered was 19 cm. Observation of the stented segment over time showed that the maximum diameter of the stented thoracic aorta was stable (P = NS), the diameter of the stented true lumen increased (P < .001), and the diameter of the stented false lumen decreased (P < .001); 84% had complete false lumen obliteration across the stented aortic segment. Observation of the uncovered thoracic aorta over time showed that the maximum diameter increased (P = .014), as did the visceral segment of the aorta (P < .001). The average growth of the visceral segment was 31% in patients with a patent false lumen vs 3% in those with a thrombosed false lumen (P = .004). One patient had aneurysmal degeneration of the false lumen and required an additional endograft at 18 months.\nTEVAR of acute AD promotes long-term remodeling across the stented segment, with false lumen obliteration in 84% of patients. However, false lumen obliteration beyond the stented segment appears necessary to prevent late aneurysmal degeneration of the distal aorta.",

To enable comparison of target vessel patency between open and endovascular treatment, we analyzed our series of open TAAA replacements.\nOur vascular surgery database was screened for patients who received open TAAA replacement between 1998 and 2012, and patient records were analyzed retrospectively. All available imaging scans (computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography: preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up) were evaluated for graft and vessel patency.\nWe identified 62 patients (mean age, 66 \u00b1 10 years; 40 men) who had been operated on for aneurysms of Crawford types I (8), II (13), III (13), and IV (24) and Safi type V (4). A total of 181 vessels were revascularized by either patch inclusion (n = 147) or selective revascularization (bypass or transposition, n = 34); 48 survived the procedure, resulting in a number of vessels available for follow-up of 154 (patch, 126; selective revascularization, 28). The respective patency rates for overall, patch, and selective revascularization were 95.2%, 94.2%, and 100% at 5 years and 83.7%, 81.3%, and 100% at 10 years, respectively. In addition, a trend for better performance of selective revascularization (bypass or transposition) was evident as all vessel occlusions were observed in cases of patch inclusion, whereas all selectively revascularized vessels were patent. The respective patency rates for the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and left and right renal artery were 100%, 97.5%, 92.3%, and 90.3% at 5 years.\nIn our series of open thoracoabdominal aortic replacement, excellent patency rates for revascularized renal and visceral vessels were observed during long-term follow-up. We were able to provide a reference value of long-term target vessel patency that can and should be taken into account to judge the efficacy of endovascular repair in TAAA.",

    "abstract": "Human placenta-derived adherent cells (PDACs) are a culture-expanded, undifferentiated mesenchymal-like population from full-term placental tissue and were previously shown to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. PDACs (formulated as PDA-002) are in clinical trials for peripheral arterial disease with diabetic foot ulcer. In the current study, we examined their angiogenic and tissue reparative properties.\nThe effects of PDACs on survival and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were tested using conditioned media and noncontact coculture. Angiogenic effects were assessed in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Hindlimb ischemia (HLI) was induced in mice and rats by femoral artery transection, and blood flow and blood vessel density were monitored in\u00a0vivo by laser Doppler and angiography in the ischemic and control limbs. Tissue damage and regeneration in HLI were examined in histologic sections of quadriceps muscle stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and newly synthesized blood vessels were detected by indoxyl-tetrazolium staining for alkaline phosphatase.\nPDACs enhanced the survival of serum-starved HUVECs and stimulated HUVEC tube formation, and in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, PDACs stimulated blood vessel formation. In HLI, intramuscular administration of PDACs resulted in improved blood flow and vascular density, and in quadriceps muscle, tissue regeneration and increased numbers of blood vessels were observed.\nPDACs exhibited various activities consistent with angiogenesis and tissue repair, supporting the continued investigation of this cell therapy as treatment for vascular disease-related indications.",

    "abstract": "The activation state of the systemic inflammatory milieu has been proposed as a critical regulator of vascular repair after injury. We evaluated the early inflammatory response after endovascular intervention for symptomatic peripheral arterial disease to determine its association with clinical success or failure.\nBlood samples were obtained from 14 patients undergoing lower extremity angioplasty/stenting and analyzed using high-throughput gene arrays, multiplex serum protein analyses, and flow cytometry.\nTime-dependent plasma protein and monocyte phenotype analyses demonstrated endovascular revascularization had a modest influence on the overall activation state of the systemic inflammatory system, with baseline variability exceeding the perturbations induced by the intervention. In contrast, specific time-dependent changes in the monocyte genome are evident in the initial 28\u00a0days, predominately in those genes associated with leukocyte extravasation. Investigating the relationship between inflammation and the 1-year success or failure of the intervention showed no single plasma protein was correlated with outcome, but a more comprehensive cluster analysis revealed a clear pattern of protein expression that was closely related to the clinical phenotype. Corresponding examination of the monocyte genome identified a gene subset at 1\u00a0day postprocedure that was predictive of clinical outcome, with most of these genes active in cell-cycle signaling.\nAlthough the global influence of angioplasty/stenting on systemic inflammation was modest, circulating cytokine and monocyte genome analyses support a pattern of early inflammation that is associated with ultimate intervention success vs failure. Molecular profiles incorporating genes involved in monocyte cell-cycle progression and homing, or proinflammatory cytokines, or both, offer the most promise for the development of class prediction tools for clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Significant hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can lead to thrombosis, with subsequent liver failure in 30% of patients. Although operative intervention or retransplantation has been the traditional solution, endovascular therapy has emerged as a less invasive treatment strategy. Prior smaller studies have been conflicting in the relative efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) vs primary stent placement for HAS.\nThis was a single-center retrospective review of all endovascular interventions for HAS after OLT during a 54-month period (August 2009-December 2013). Patients with ultrasound imaging with evidence of severe HAS (peak systolic velocity >400-450 cm/s, resistive index <0.5) underwent endovascular treatment with primary stent placement or PTA. Outcomes calculated were technical success, primary and primary assisted patency rates, reinterventions, and complications.\nSixty-two interventions for HAS were performed in 42 patients with a mean follow-up of 19.1 \u00b1 15.2 months. During the study period, 654 OLTs were performed. Of 61 patients diagnosed with HAS, 42 underwent an endovascular intervention. The rate of endovascularly treated HAS was 6.4% (42 of 654). Primary technical success was achieved in 95% (59 of 62) of the interventions. Initial treatment was with PTA alone in 17 or primary stent in 25. Primary patency rates after initial stent placement were 87%, 76.5%, 78%, and 78% at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, compared with initial PTA rates of 64.7%, 53.3%, 40%, and 0% (P = .19). There were 20 reinterventions in 14 patients (eight stents, six PTAs). The time to the initial reintervention was 51 days in patients with PTA alone vs 105.8 days for those with an initial stent (P = .16). Overall primary assisted patency was 93% at 24 months. Major complications were one arterial rupture and two hepatic artery dissections. The long-term risk of hepatic artery thrombosis in the entire patient cohort was 3.2%.\nHAS after OLT can be treated endovascularly with high technical success and excellent primary assisted patency. This series represents the largest reported cohort of endovascular interventions for HAS to date. Initial use of a stent showed a strong trend toward decreasing the need for reintervention. Avoidance of hepatic artery thrombosis is possible in >95% of patients with endovascular treatment and close follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is known to be one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension, and early nonrandomized studies suggested that renal artery stenting (RASt) improved outcomes. The vascular community embraced this less invasive treatment alternative to surgery, and RASt increased in popularity during the late 1990s. However, recent randomized studies have failed to show a benefit regarding blood pressure or renal function when RASt was compared with best medical therapy, creating significant concerns about procedural efficacy. In the wake of these randomized trial results, hypertension and renal disease experts along with vascular interventional specialists now struggle with how to best manage atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. This review objectively analyzes the current literature and highlights each trial's design weaknesses and strengths. We have provided our recommendations for contemporary treatment guidelines based on our interpretation of the available empirical data.",

    "abstract": "Patients with limb-threatening ischemia exhibit uneven patterns of perfusion in the foot, which makes it challenging to determine adequate topographic perfusion by angiography alone. This study assessed the feasibility of reporting dynamic relative oxygen indices and tissue oxygen concentration from multiple locations on the foot during endovascular therapy using a novel micro-oxygen sensor (MOXY; PROFUSA, Inc, South San Francisco, Calif) approach.\nA prospective, 28-day, single-arm, observational study was performed in 10 patients who underwent endovascular therapy for limb-threatening ischemia. At least 24 hours before therapy, four microsensors were injected in each patient (one in the arm, three in the treated foot). The optical signal from the microsensors corresponded to tissue oxygen concentration. A custom detector on the surface of the skin was used to continuously and noninvasively measure the signals from the microsensors. The ability to locate and read the signal from each injected microsensor was characterized. Oxygen data from the microsensors were collected throughout the revascularization procedure. The timing of therapy deployment was recorded during the procedure to assess its relationship with the microsensor oxygen data. Oxygen data collection and clinical evaluation were performed immediately postoperatively as well as postoperatively on days 7, 14, 21, and 28.\nThe study enrolled 10 patients (50% male) with ischemia (30% Rutherford class 4, 70% Rutherford class 5). Patients were a mean age of 70.7 years (range, 46-90 years), and all were Hispanic of varying origin. Microsensors were successfully read 206 of 212 times (97.2%) in all patients during the course of the study. Microsensors were compatible with intraoperative use in the interventional suite and postoperatively in an office setting. In nine of 10 revascularization procedures, at least one of the three MOXYs showed an immediate change in the dynamic relative oxygen index, correlating to deployed therapy. Moreover, there was a statistically significant increase in the concentration of oxygen in the foot in preoperative levels compared with postoperative levels. No adverse events occurred related to the microsensor materials.\nThis MOXY approach appears to be safe when implanted in patients with limb-threatening ischemia undergoing endovascular recanalization and is effective in reporting local tissue oxygen concentrations over a course of 28 days. Further testing is needed to determine its potential effect on clinical decision making, both acutely on-table and chronically as a surveillance modality, which ultimately can lead to improved healing and limb salvage.",

Manual measurements of vessel origin locations from computed tomography images, however, take time and can lead to errors in the positions of the fenestrations. To make the fenestration process faster and more accurate, we have developed a procedure to create custom templates that serve as patient-specific guides for graft fenestration. We use a three-dimensional printer to create a clear rigid sleeve that replicates the patient's aorta and includes holes placed precisely at the locations of the branch vessels. The sleeve is slipped over the graft, the locations of the openings are marked with a pen, and the fenestrations are created after the sleeve is removed. Custom fenestration templates can potentially save procedural costs and make minimally invasive aortic aneurysm repair available to more patients.",

    "abstract": "Open repair (OPEN) and conservative management (CONS) have been the treatments of choice for splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) for many years. Endovascular repair (EV) has been increasingly used with good short-term results. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OPEN, EV, and CONS for the treatment of SAAs.\nA decision analysis model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2013 software (TreeAge Inc, Williamstown, Mass) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatments for SAAs. A hypothetical cohort of 10,000 55-year-old female patients with SAAs was assessed in the reference-case analysis. Perioperative mortality, disease-specific mortality rates, complications, rupture risks, and reinterventions were retrieved from a recent and extensive meta-analysis. Costs were analyzed with the 2014 Medicare database. The willingness to pay was set to $60,000/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Outcomes evaluated were QALYs, costs from the health care perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed and different clinical scenarios evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to include the uncertainty around the variables. A flowchart for clinical decision-making was developed.\nFor a 55-year-old female patient with a SAA, EV has the highest QALYs (11.32; 95% credibility interval [CI], 9.52-13.17), followed by OPEN (10.48; 95% CI, 8.75-12.25) and CONS (10.39; 95% CI, 8.96-11.87). The difference in effect for 55-year-old female patients between EV and OPEN is 0.84 QALY (95% CI, 0.42-1.34), comparable with 10 months in perfect health. EV is more effective and less costly than OPEN and more effective and more expensive compared with CONS, with an ICER of $17,154/QALY. Moreover, OPEN, with an ICER of $223,166/QALY, is not cost-effective compared with CONS. In elderly individuals (age >78 years), the ICER of EV vs CONS is $60,503/QALY and increases further with age, making EV no longer cost-effective. Very elderly patients (age >93 years) have higher QALYs and lower costs when treated with CONS. The EV group has the highest number of expected reinterventions, followed by CONS and OPEN, and the number of expected reinterventions decreases with age.\nEV is the most cost-effective treatment for most patient groups with SAAs, independent of the sex and risk profile of the patient. EV is superior to OPEN, being both cost-saving and more effective in all age groups. Elderly patients should be considered for CONS, based on the high costs in relation to the very small gain in health when treated with EV. The very elderly should be treated with CONS.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of fenestrated and multibranched endografting transformed the treatment paradigm of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). However, despite the minimally invasive character of the procedure, spinal cord ischemia (SCI) remains a devastating complication. The aim of this study was to address the SCI rates after endovascular TAAA repair and to analyze potential risk factors leading to this complication.\nA consecutive cohort of patients with nonruptured TAAAs treated by means of fenestrated and multibranched endografting between January 2010 and September 2014 was analyzed. Neurologic examination was routinely performed by an independent neurologist before operation and at discharge. The main outcome measure was the onset of SCI (paraplegia or paraparesis). Secondary outcomes were neurologic complications associated with cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) and 30-day mortality. Finally, a multivariate regression analysis identified risk factors for SCI.\nA consecutive 142 patients with TAAAs (Crawford type II, n = 54 [38%]; type III, n = 76 [54%]; type IV, n = 12 [8%]) were included in this study. The majority of patients (n = 129 [91%]) were treated for an atherosclerotic aneurysm, whereas 13 patients (9%) were treated for a postdissection aneurysm. The mean maximal aortic diameter was 65 \u00b1 13 mm. SCI developed in 23 patients (16%; paraplegia in 12 [8%] and paraparesis in 11 [8%]). Of these 23 patients, 10 patients (43%) showed the neurologic deficit directly after the procedure, 11 patients (48%) in the first 24 hours, and 2 patients (9%) after 24 hours. There was an improvement of the neurologic status in the majority of patients, with only three patients (2%) showing irreversible paraplegia at discharge. There was no difference in the 30-day mortality between patients with and without SCI (no SCI, n = 3 [3%] vs SCI, n = 1 [4%]; P = .511). Prophylactic use of CSFD before the procedure was performed in 64 patients (45%), and among them, 4 patients (6%) developed a CSFD-associated complication. No clinical benefit for patients receiving prophylactic placement of CSFD was found (P = .498). The multivariate analysis revealed the percentage of thoracic aortic coverage as the only significant risk factor for SCI (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.05; P = .001).\nThe SCI rate after endovascular repair of TAAA was 16%, with 8% of those patients suffering from paraplegia. Prophylactic use of CSFD could not reduce the SCI rate and was associated with 6% adverse events. The percentage of thoracic aortic coverage was the most powerful determinant of SCI in these series.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound (DUS) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are both used as first-line noninvasive methods to investigate patients for internal carotid artery (ICA) disease. Although manual assessment of CTA is well established, semiautomated vessel analysis programs have yet to prove their clinical benefit. We compared one such vessel analysis program (TeraRecon, Foster City, Calif) with DUS.\nA total of 85 arteries in 50 patients (35 men, 15 women; mean age, 73 \u00b1 10 years) were eligible for comparison with the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. Duplex scanning comprised stenosis estimation based on (1) the intrastenotic and distal ICA diameter measurements on color-coded imaging (CCI), (2) the application of German Society for Ultrasound in Medicine (DEGUM) criteria (intrastenotic peak systolic velocity [PSV] \u2265 2 00 cm/s indicates 50% stenosis; intrastenotic PSV \u2265 300 cm/s together with a PSV of \u2265 50 cm/s in the distal ICA indicates 70% stenosis), and (3) the application of the University of Washington stenosis criteria (\u2265 50% stenosis is indicated by PSV >125 cm/s and end-diastolic velocity <140 cm/s; \u2265 80% stenosis is indicated by PSV >125 cm/s and end-diastolic velocity \u2265 140 cm/s). The minimum and maximum diameters at the stenosis site and at the distal reference ICA were automatically measured with the CTA vessel analysis tool. In addition, automated tracking generated corresponding cross-sectional areas at these two sites. Angiographic stenosis was then calculated using the minimum diameter (CTAmin), the average of the minimum and maximum diameters (CTAavg), and the areas (CTAarea) at both sites.\nCompared with duplex CCI, the three CTA modalities exhibited only a moderate agreement in terms of regression analysis (R(2) = 0.41-0.54) and Bland-Altman analysis (the standard deviation of the stenosis differences was >20%). In terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy, DEGUM stenosis graduation was best balanced by duplex CCI (50% stenosis: 100%, 93%, 85%, 100%, 95%; 70% stenosis: 71%, 100%, 100%, 97%, 98%) followed by CTAarea (50% stenosis: 80%, 73%, 54%, 90%, 75%; 70% stenosis: 66%, 94%, 55%, 96%, 96%). University of Washington stenosis was best balanced by duplex CCI followed by CTAarea.\nCTA analysis with a semiautomated vessel analysis tool provides variable results. Large discrepancies between methods in the degree of reported stenosis must be taken into consideration when CTA and DUS are used for clinical purposes. The semiautomated software tools need further improvements.",

    "abstract": "This study validated duplex ultrasound measurement of brachial artery volume flow (VF) as predictor of dialysis access flow maturation and successful hemodialysis.\nDuplex ultrasound was used to image upper extremity dialysis access anatomy and estimate access VF within 1 to 2 weeks of the procedure. Correlation of brachial artery VF with dialysis access conduit VF was performed using a standardized duplex testing protocol in 75 patients. The hemodynamic data were used to develop brachial artery flow velocity criteria (peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity) predictive of three VF categories: low (<600 mL/min), acceptable (600-800 mL/min), or high (>800 mL/min). Brachial artery VF was then measured in 148 patients after a primary (n = 86) or revised (n = 62) upper extremity dialysis access procedure, and the VF category correlated with access maturation or need for revision before hemodialysis usage. Access maturation was conferred when brachial artery VF was >600 mL/min and conduit imaging indicated successful cannulation based on anatomic criteria of conduit diameter >5 mm and skin depth <6 mm.\nMeasurements of VF from the brachial artery and access conduit demonstrated a high degree of correlation (R(2) = 0.805) for autogenous vein (n = 45; R(2) = 0.87) and bridge graft (n = 30; R(2) = 0.78) dialysis accesses. Access VF of >800 mL/min was predicted when the brachial artery lumen diameter was >4.5 mm, peak systolic velocity was >150 cm/s, and the diastolic-to-systolic velocity ratio was >0.4. Brachial artery velocity spectra indicating VF <800 mL/min was associated (P < .0001) with failure of access maturation. Revision was required in 15 of 21 (71%) accesses with a VF of <600 mL/min, 4 of 40 accesses (10%) with aVF of 600 to 800 mL/min, and 2 of 87 accesses (2.3%) with an initial VF of >800 mL/min. Duplex testing to estimate brachial artery VF and assess the conduit for ease of cannulation can be performed in 5 minutes during the initial postoperative vascular clinic evaluation.\nEstimation of brachial artery VF using the duplex ultrasound, termed the \"Fast, 5-min Dialysis Duplex Scan,\" facilitates patient evaluation after new or revised upper extremity dialysis access procedures. Brachial artery VF correlates with access VF measurements and has the advantage of being easier to perform and applicable for forearm and also arm dialysis access. When brachial artery velocity spectra criteria confirm a VF >800 mL/min, flow maturation and successful hemodialysis are predicted if anatomic criteria for conduit cannulation are also present.",

Duplicate independent review was used for study selection, data abstraction, and critical appraisals.\nThirty-six studies were included for synthesis, of which 94.1% applied a retrospective cohort design to prospective institutional databases.

Eight studies explicitly described the method of dealing with LTFU: eight used survival analysis and one used a national Social Security Death Index. Sensitivity analyses using plausible worst-case LTFU scenarios resulted in 14% to 17% of studies changing direction of effect.\nThere is significant LTFU in trauma studies comparing operative methods for BTAIs. LTFU is generally handled and reported suboptimally, and sensitivity analyses suggest that study results are sensitive to differential LTFU. This has implications for the evidence-based choice of the operative method. Some protective factors that may aid in reducing LTFU were identified, one of which was involvement of a surgical or interventional specialist as a key author.",

    "abstract": "Although evidence has shown that ischemic heart disease (IHD) in vascular surgery patients has a negative impact on the prognosis after surgery, it is unclear whether directed treatment of IHD may influence cause-specific and overall mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic implication of coronary revascularization (CR) on overall and cause-specific mortality in vascular surgery patients.\nPatients undergoing surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid artery stenosis, or peripheral artery disease in a university hospital in The Netherlands between January 2003 and December 2011 were retrospectively included. Survival estimates were obtained by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis.\nA total of 1104 patients were included. Adjusted survival analyses showed that IHD significantly increased the risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.87) and cardiovascular death (HR, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.76). Compared with those without CR, patients previously undergoing CR had similar overall mortality (HR, 1.38 vs 1.62; P = .274) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.83 vs 2.02; P = .656). Nonrevascularized IHD patients were more likely to die of IHD (6.9% vs 35.7%), whereas revascularized IHD patients more frequently died of cardiovascular causes unrelated to IHD (39.1% vs 64.3%; P = .018).\nThis study confirms the significance of IHD for postoperative survival of vascular surgery patients. CR was associated with lower IHD-related death rates. However, it failed to provide an overall survival benefit because of an increased rate of cardiovascular mortality unrelated to IHD. Intensification of secondary prevention regimens may be required to prevent this shift toward non-IHD-related death and thereby improve life expectancy.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of popliteal artery injury (PAI) caused by blunt or penetrating mechanism is demanding. Concomitant injuries and prolonged ischemia are the major causes of lower extremity morbidity and poor rates of limb salvage. This study assessed the amputation rate and, subsequently, the therapeutic management and clinical outcomes regarding the affect of concomitant injuries among patients with PAI in a setting of central European trauma care.\nSixty-four patients (20 female and 44 male), with an average age of 44 years (range, 17-79 years) at the time of injury, were evaluated for clinical characteristics, concomitant injuries, complications, amputation rates, and functional outcome after traumatic PAI. The mechanism of injury was blunt trauma in 35 patients (54.7%) and penetrating trauma in 29 (45.3%). The Mangled Extremity Severity Score and the Injury Severity Score were assessed initially and the modified Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Score at 12 months after the primary surgery.\nThirty patients (47%) returned to their normal activity level within 1 year after trauma, and 16 (25%) were limited in their daily activity or suffered from chronic pain symptoms. Within the blunt trauma group 26 of 35 patients (74%) sustained severe concomitant injuries, whereas two of 29 patients (7%) in the penetrating group showed severe concomitant injuries (P < .046). Eleven patients (17%) had to undergo revision surgery due to their associated injuries. The median modified FIM score was 10.3, whereas patients with blunt trauma had significantly lower FIM score (P < .0082). The median Mangled Extremity Severity Score was 6 points (range, 6-16 points). Primary or secondary amputation was required in 18 patients (28%) due to failure of revascularization. Patients who sustained blunt trauma had significantly higher amputation rates than those with penetrating injuries (P < .035).\nClinical outcome and limb salvage of patients with PAI were influenced by the mechanism of trauma, concomitant injuries, prolonged ischemia time, and the type of surgical procedure. Patients after blunt trauma had a higher incidence of concomitant injuries, and (comminuted) fractures or knee dislocations and severe soft tissue damage had the highest effect on the amputation rate.",

    "abstract": "The eversion technique for carotid endarterectomy (eCEA) offers an alternative to longitudinal arteriotomy and patch closure (pCEA) for open carotid revascularization. In some reports, eCEA has been associated with a higher rate of >50% restenosis of the internal carotid when it is defined as peak systolic velocity (PSV) >125 cm/s by duplex imaging. Because the conformation of the carotid bifurcation may differ after eCEA compared with native carotid arteries, it was hypothesized that standard duplex criteria might not accurately reflect the presence of restenosis after eCEA.\nIn a case-control study, the outcomes of all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy by one surgeon during the last 10 years were analyzed retrospectively, with a primary end point of PSV >125 cm/s. Duplex flow velocities were compared with luminal diameter measurements for any carotid computed tomography arteriography or magnetic resonance angiography study obtained within 2 months of duplex imaging, with the degree of stenosis calculated by the methodology used in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) as well as cross-sectional area (CSA) reduction. Simulations were generated and analyzed by computational model simulations of the eCEA and pCEA arteries.\nEversion and longitudinal arteriotomy with patch techniques were used in 118 and 177 carotid arteries, respectively. Duplex follow-up was available in 90 eCEA arteries at a median of 16 (range, 2-136) months and in 150 pCEA arteries at a median of 41 (range, 3-115) months postoperatively. PSV >125 cm/s was present at some time during follow-up in 31% of eCEA and pCEA carotid arteries, each, and in the most recent duplex examination in 7% after eCEA and 21% after pCEA (P = .003), with no eCEA and two pCEA arteries occluding completely during follow-up (P = .29). In 19 carotid arteries with PSV >125 cm/s after angle correction (median, 160 cm/s; interquartile range, 146-432 cm/s) after eCEA that were subsequently examined by axial imaging, the mean percentage stenosis was 8% \u00b1 11% by NASCET, 11% \u00b1 5% by ECST, and 20% \u00b1 9% by CSA criteria. For eight pCEA arteries with PSV >125 cm/s (median velocity, 148 cm/s; interquartile range, 139-242 cm/s), the corresponding NASCET, ECST, and CSA stenoses were 8% \u00b1 35%, 26% \u00b1 32%, and 25% \u00b1 33%, respectively. NASCET internal carotid diameter reduction of at least 50% was noted by axial imaging after two of the eight pCEAs, and the PSV exceeded 200 cm/s in each case.\nThe presence of hemodynamically significant carotid artery restenosis may be overestimated by standard duplex criteria after eCEA and perhaps after pCEA. Insufficient information currently exists to determine what PSV does correspond to hemodynamically significant restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported that endovascular repair (EVAR) of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) has lower postoperative mortality than open repair (OR). However, comparisons involved heterogeneous populations that lacked adjustment for preoperative risk. We hypothesize that for RAAA patients stratified by a validated measure of preoperative mortality risk, EVAR has a lower in-hospital mortality and morbidity than does OR.\nIn-hospital mortality and morbidity after EVAR and OR of RAAA were compared in patients from the Vascular Quality Initiative (2003-2013) stratified by the validated Vascular Study Group of New England RAAA risk score into low-risk (score 0-1), medium-risk (score 2-3), and high-risk (score 4-6) groups.\nAmong 514 patients who underwent EVAR and 651 patients who underwent OR of RAAA, EVAR had lower in-hospital mortality (25% vs 33%, P = .001). In risk-stratified patients, EVAR trended toward a lower mortality in the low-risk group (n = 626; EVAR, 10% vs OR, 15%; P = .07), had a significantly lower mortality in the medium-risk group (n = 457; EVAR, 37% vs OR, 48%; P = .02), and no advantage in the high-risk group (n = 82; EVAR, 95% vs OR, 79%; P = .17). Across all risk groups, cardiac complications (EVAR, 29% vs OR, 38%; P = .001), respiratory complications (EVAR, 28% vs OR, 46%; P < .0001), renal insufficiency (EVAR, 24% vs OR, 38%; P < .0001), lower extremity ischemia (EVAR, 2.7% vs OR, 8.1%; P < .0001), and bowel ischemia (EVAR, 3.9% vs OR, 10%; P < .0001) were significantly lower after EVAR than after OR. Across all risk groups, median (interquartile range) intensive care unit length of stay (EVAR, 2 [1-5] days vs OR, 6 [3-13] days; P < .0001) and hospital length of stay (EVAR, 6 [4-12] days vs OR, 13 [8-22] days; P < .0001) were lower after EVAR.\nThis novel risk-stratified comparison using a national clinical database showed that EVAR of RAAA has a lower mortality and morbidity compared with OR in low-risk and medium-risk patients and that EVAR should be used to treat these patients when anatomically feasible. For RAAA patients at the highest preoperative risk, there is no benefit to using EVAR compared with OR.",

    "abstract": "The Supera stent (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill) has a unique biomimetic design allowing axial and longitudinal flexibility and fracture resistance. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the midterm patency of Supera stents used to treat patients with superficial femoral and popliteal arterial disease by a single practice.\nFrom April 2010 to December 2011, 53 patients and 59 limbs with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions underwent angioplasty and stenting with the Supera stent. Five patients had no follow-up and were excluded. Demographics of the patients, radiographic images, morphologic features of the lesions, procedural reports, reinterventions, and follow-up clinical visit notes were reviewed. Primary patency was defined as clinical resolution of symptoms with no secondary interventions. Primary and secondary patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nA total of 48 patients (42 men, six women; 54 limbs; mean age, 64.3 years [range, 51-87]) received Supera stents and had at least one follow-up visit as part of their treatment for femoropopliteal disease. Primary indications for intervention included claudication, rest pain, and tissue loss, at rates of 54% (29 of 54), 26% (14 of 54), and 20% (11 of 54), respectively; 22% of lesions were TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus type A or B and 78% were type C or D. Mean lesion length was 24.0 cm (range, 3-51). Mean follow-up was 27.5 months (range, 1-45). The ankle-brachial index increased from 0.58 \u00b1 0.20 preoperatively to 0.77 \u00b1 0.18 postoperatively (P = .00004). Primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates at latest follow-up were 79.6%, 88.9%, and 92.3%, respectively. Cumulative primary patency rates by Kaplan-Meier analysis at 12, 24, and 36 months were 85.6%, 83.1%, and 76.7%, respectively. Secondary patency rates by Kaplan-Meier estimates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 93.8%, 93.8%, and 89.3%, respectively. No stent fractures were found at the time of any reinterventions. Long lesions >30 cm (n = 18) showed equivalent patency to lesions of 1 to 15 cm (n = 18) and lesions 15 to 30 cm in length (n = 18).\nOur midterm results show that Supera stents are durable in treating femoropopliteal lesions, with notably high patency rates in patients with long lesion lengths.",

    "abstract": "The treatment outcomes of ruptured visceral artery aneurysms (rVAAs) have been sparsely characterized, with no clear comparison between different treatment modalities. The purpose of this paper was to review the perioperative and long-term outcomes of open and endovascular interventions for intact visceral artery aneurysms (iVAAs) and rVAAs.\nThis was a retrospective review of all treated VAAs at one institution from 2003 to 2013. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, management, and subsequent outcomes (technical success, mortality, reintervention) and complications were recorded.\nThe study identified 261 patients; 181 patients were repaired (77 ruptured, 104 intact). Pseudoaneurysms were more common in rVAAs (81.8% vs 35.3% for iVAAs; P < .001). The rVAAs were smaller than the iVAAs (20.7 mm vs 27.5 mm; P = .018), and their most common presentation was abdominal pain; 29.7% were hemodynamically unstable. Endovascular intervention was the initial treatment modality for 67.4% (75.3% for rVAAs, 61.5% for iVAAs). The perioperative complication rate was higher for rVAAs (13.7% vs 1% for iVAAs; P = .003), as was mortality at 30 days (13% vs 0% for iVAAs; P = .001), 1 year (32.5% for rVAAs vs 4.1% for iVAAs; P < .001), and 3 years (36.4% for rVAAs vs 8.3% for iVAAs; P < .001). Lower 30-day mortality was noted with endovascular repair for rVAAs (7.4% vs 28.6% open; P = .025). Predictors of mortality for rVAAs included age (odds ratio, 1.04; P = .002), whereas endovascular repair was protective (odds ratio, 0.43; P = .037). Mean follow-up was 26.2 months, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were higher for iVAAs at 3 years (88% vs 62% for rVAAs; P = .045). The 30-day reintervention rate was higher for rVAAs (7.7% vs 19.5% for iVAAs; P = .019) but was similar between open and endovascular repair (8.2% vs 15%; P = NS).\nrVAAs have significant mortality. Open and endovascular interventions are equally durable for elective repair of VAAs, but endovascular interventions for rVAAs result in lower morbidity and mortality. Aggressive treatment of pseudoaneurysms is electively recommended at diagnosis regardless of size.",

    "abstract": "Endograft mural thrombus has been associated with stent graft or limb thrombosis after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). This study aimed to identify clinical and morphologic determinants of endograft mural thrombus accumulation and its influence on thromboembolic events after EVAR.\nA prospectively maintained database of patients treated by EVAR at a tertiary institution from 2000 to 2012 was analyzed. Patients treated for degenerative infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms and with available imaging for thrombus analysis were considered. All measurements were performed on three-dimensional center-lumen line computed tomography angiography (CTA) reconstructions. Patients with thrombus accumulation within the endograft's main body with a thickness >2 mm and an extension >25% of the main body's circumference were included in the study group and compared with a control group that included all remaining patients. Clinical and morphologic variables were assessed for association with significant thrombus accumulation within the endograft's main body by multivariate regression analysis. Estimates for freedom from thromboembolic events were obtained by Kaplan-Meier plots.\nSixty-eight patients (16.4%) presented with endograft mural thrombus. Median follow-up time was 3.54 years (interquartile range, 1.99-5.47 years). In-graft mural thrombus was identified on 30-day CTA in 22 patients (32.4% of the study group), on 6-month CTA in 8 patients (11.8%), and on 1-year CTA in 17 patients (25%). Intraprosthetic thrombus progressively accumulated during the study period in 40 patients of the study group (55.8%). Overall, 17 patients (4.1%) presented with endograft or limb occlusions, 3 (4.4%) in the thrombus group and 14 (4.1%) in the control group (P = .89). Thirty-one patients (7.5%) received an aortouni-iliac (AUI) endograft. Two endograft occlusions were identified among AUI devices (6.5%; overall, 0.5%). None of these patients showed thrombotic deposits in the main body, nor were any outflow abnormalities identified on the immediately preceding CTA. Estimated freedom from thromboembolic events at 5 years was 95% in both groups (P = .97). Endograft thrombus accumulation was associated with >25% proximal aneurysm neck thrombus coverage at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.3), neck length \u2264 15 mm (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2), proximal neck diameter \u2265 30 mm (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.6), AUI (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-5.5), or polyester-covered stent grafts (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.2-7.3) and with main component \"barrel-like\" configuration (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.7-28.3).\nMural thrombus formation within the main body of the endograft is related to different endograft configurations, main body geometry, and device fabric but appears to have no association with the occurrence of thromboembolic events over time.",

Endograft thrombus accumulation was associated with >25% proximal aneurysm neck thrombus coverage at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.3), neck length \u2264 15 mm (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2), proximal neck diameter \u2265 30 mm (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.6), AUI (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-5.5), or polyester-covered stent grafts (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.2-7.3) and with main component \"barrel-like\" configuration (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.7-28.3).",

    "abstract": "There is abundant evidence linking hostile proximal aortic neck anatomy to poor outcome after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), yet the definition of hostile anatomy varies from study to study. This current analysis was undertaken to identify anatomic criteria that are most predictive of success or failure at the aortic neck after EVAR.\nThe study group comprised 221 patients in the Aneurysm Treatment using the Heli-FX Aortic Securement System Global Registry (ANCHOR) clinical trial, a population enriched with patients with challenging aortic neck anatomy and failure of sealing. Imaging protocols were not protocol specified but were performed according to the institution's standard of care. Core laboratory analysis assessed the three-dimensional centerline-reformatted computed tomography scans. Failure at the aortic neck was defined by type Ia endoleak occurring at the time of the initial endograft implantation or during follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the value of each anatomic measure in the classification of aortic neck success and failure and to identify optimal thresholds of discrimination. Binary logistic regression was performed after excluding highly intercorrelated variables, creating a final model with significant predictors of outcome after EVAR.\nAmong the 221 patients, 121 (54.8%) remained free of type Ia endoleak and 100 (45.2%) did not. Type Ia endoleaks presented immediately after endograft deployment in 58 (58.0%) or during follow-up in 42 (42.0%). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 12 variables where the classification of patients with type Ia endoleak was significantly more accurate than chance alone. Increased aortic neck diameter at the lowest renal artery (P = .013) and at 5 mm (P = .008), 10 mm (P = .008), and 15 mm (P = .010) distally; aneurysm sac diameter (P = .001), common iliac artery diameters (right, P = .012; left, P = .032), and a conical (P = .049) neck configuration were predictive of endoleak. By contrast, increased aortic neck length (P = .050), a funnel-shaped aortic neck (P = .036), and neck mural thrombus content, as measured by average thickness (P = .044) or degrees of circumferential coverage (P = .029), were protective against endoleak. Binary logistic regression identified three variables independently predictive of type Ia endoleak. Neck diameter at the lowest renal artery (P = .002, cutpoint 26 mm) and neck length (P = .017, cutpoint 17 mm) were associated with endoleak, whereas some mural neck thrombus content was protective (P = .001, cutpoint 11\u00b0 of circumferential coverage).\nA limited number of independent anatomic variables are predictive of type Ia endoleak after EVAR, including aortic neck diameter and aortic neck length, whereas mural thrombus in the neck is protective. This study suggests that anatomic measures with identifiable threshold cutpoints should be considered when defining the hostile aortic neck and assessing the risk of complications after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the correlation between an upper limb vascular calcification (Vc) score (VcS) and late all-cause mortality in diabetic hemodialysis patients with distal upper limb arteries medial wall sclerosis (M\u00f6nckeberg disease).\nWe retrospectively reviewed Vc in bilateral upper limb plain radiographs and in duplex ultrasound images performed before radial-cephalic fistula (RCF) creation in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Only medial linear calcifications outlining the vessel wall were considered positive on X-ray images, whereas for ultrasound reviews, only continuous highly echogenic plaques producing bright white echos with shadowing were considered to be medial calcification. A VcS was then applied in each patient. Every half of each of the three main arterial conduits (brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries) in each arm was counted as 1 if it contained \u2265 6 cm of linear calcification, whereas absence of calcification or minimum calcification (length <6 cm) was counted as 0. Long-term all-cause mortality was compared between patients with a low or moderate VcS <8 (group I), patients with a high VcS \u2265 8 (group II), and patients with VcS = 0 (control group). Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for comparisons among the groups.\nNineteen patients had a VcS <8, 21 had VcS \u2265 8, and 43 patients had VcS = 0. The study patients had a mean age of 68 \u00b1 10 years (range, 42-83 years; P = .23). Before early conversion to a RCF, dialysis therapy in 59 (71.1%) had already been initiated through central venous catheters (CVCs).

    "abstract": "We evaluated carotid artery outward remodeling and plaque relative signal intensity (rSI) using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI) to investigate their clinical significance in carotid revascularization.\nFrom 86 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS), 88 lesions (51 lesions treated with CEA and 37 lesions treated with CAS) were analyzed retrospectively. We evaluated the preoperative carotid artery remodeling index (CRI), determined by a ratio of the external cross-sectional vessel area at maximum stenosis and the reference cross-sectional vessel area at the distal portion of the internal carotid artery, and the plaque rSI, which is quantified as the ratio between the signal intensities of plaque and adjacent muscle using T1-MRI. We divided carotid lesions into four groups using the median values of CRI and rSI: L/L (CRI < 1.8, rSI < 2.5), H/L (CRI \u2265 1.8, rSI < 2.5), L/H (CRI < 1.8, rSI \u2265 2.5), and H/H (CRI \u2265 1.8, rSI \u2265 2.5). The primary end point was detection of acute ipsilateral ischemia on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 72 hours of treatment.\nMean CRI and rSI were significantly higher in lesions treated with CEA than in those treated with CAS. Postoperative DWI abnormalities were observed in 4 CEA cases (7.8%) and 10 CAS cases (27.0%) (P = .01). In the CAS group, the frequency of DWI abnormalities was 5.5% for the L/L, 40.0% for the H/L and L/H, and 55.5% for the H/H group (P = .009). Multivariate analysis showed that the degree of stenosis and H/H lesion were independent risk factors for cerebral embolism. No correlation was found between plaque parameters and postoperative DWI findings in the CEA group.\nCRI and rSI provide complementary information for the prediction of high-risk plaques associated with CAS but not with CEA. Preoperative evaluation with T1-MRI facilitates the selection of a treatment strategy for carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "The Zenith pivot branch (p-branch) fenestrated endovascular graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) is a new \"off-the-shelf\" device to treat patients with juxtarenal aortic aneurysms (JRAs). Two options are currently available, which appear to suit >70% of white patients. This study investigates the anatomic applicability of the p-branch fenestrated graft in a cohort of Asian patients with JRA.\nComputed tomography images of 51 consecutive Asian patients with JRA (43 men; mean age, 76.8 years) were analyzed on an Aquarius workstation (TeraRecon, San Mateo, Calif) and matched to two current configurations of the p-branch (options A and B: single superior mesenteric artery [SMA] and two renal fenestrations, and a celiac axis scallop). With use of the SMA as reference, the anatomic positions of both renal arteries and the celiac axis were figured together with their diameters on a template generated on MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Mass), and then they were matched with two graft configurations. The renal artery origins were assessed for three classes of \"closeness of fit\" based on diameter: perfect match, marginal match, and mismatch, respectively, defined as the renal artery origins being located entirely inside, partially inside, and completely outside their corresponding fenestrations. The suitability of the p-branch graft design to the aneurysms was then evaluated.\nA total of 31 JRA patients (60.8%) were regarded as suitable candidates for one or both p-branch stent grafts (20 with option A, 22 with option B, and 11 with both options). In 35 patients (68.6%), both renal arteries could be aligned with the fenestrations. Among them, 16 patients (31.4%) were perfectly matched, whereas 19 patients (37.2%) were only marginally suitable. The major reason for exclusion was the misalignment of the renal fenestrations. In 16 patients with unsuitable renal fenestrations, 8 were attributed to the right renal origins being located too distally compared with their corresponding fenestrations. Another reason for exclusion was the position of the celiac axis scallop in four patients (7.84%), and insufficient aortic length for the graft was encountered in another four. If the right renal fenestration of option B was adjusted to 20 mm caudal to the SMA fenestration (level with the left fenestration), the match of renal fenestration could reach 78.4% (40 of 51).\nThe present design of the p-branch off-the-shelf fenestrated graft is feasible for a good proportion of JRA patients in Asia. Further refinement of design may improve the anatomic match, especially a lower right renal artery origin.",

In 35 patients (68.6%), both renal arteries could be aligned with the fenestrations. Among them, 16 patients (31.4%) were perfectly matched, whereas 19 patients (37.2%) were only marginally suitable. The major reason for exclusion was the misalignment of the renal fenestrations. In 16 patients with unsuitable renal fenestrations, 8 were attributed to the right renal origins being located too distally compared with their corresponding fenestrations. Another reason for exclusion was the position of the celiac axis scallop in four patients (7.84%), and insufficient aortic length for the graft was encountered in another four. If the right renal fenestration of option B was adjusted to 20 mm caudal to the SMA fenestration (level with the left fenestration), the match of renal fenestration could reach 78.4% (40 of 51).",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery patients have increased medical comorbidities that amplify the complexity of their care. We assessed the effect of a hospitalist comanagement service on inpatient vascular surgery outcomes.\nWe divided 1059 patients into two cohorts for comparison: 515 between January 2012 and December 2012, before the implementation of a hospitalist comanagement service, and 544 between January 2013 and October 2013, after the initiation of a hospitalist comanagement service. Nine vascular surgeons and 10 hospitalists participated in the hospitalist comanagement service. End points measured were in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rates, visual analog scale pain scores (0-10), inpatient adult safety assessments using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators, and resident perceptions assessed by survey.\nThe in-hospital mortality rate decreased from 1.75% to 0.37% after the implementation of the hospitalist comanagement service (P = .016), with a decrease in the observed-to-expected ratio from 0.89 to 0.22. The risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality decreased from 1.56% to 0.0008% (P = .003). Mean LOS was lower in the base period, at 5.1 days vs 5.5 days (P < .001), with an observed-to-expected ratio of 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. The risk-adjusted LOS increased from 4.2 days to 4.3 days (P < .001). The overall 30-day readmission rate was unchanged, at 23.1% compared with 22.8% (P = .6). The related 30-day readmission rate was also similar, at 11.5% compared with 11.4% (P = .5). Patients reporting no pain during hospitalization increased from 72.8% before the hospitalist comanagement service to 77.8% after (P = .04). Reports of moderate pain decreased from 14% to 9.6% (P = .016). Mild and severe pain scores were similar between the two groups. Adult safety measured by AHRQ demonstrated a decrease from three to zero patients in the number of deaths among surgical patients with treatable complications (P = .04). Most house staff reported that the comanagement program had a positive effect on patient care and education.\nThe hospitalist comanagement service has resulted in a significant decrease in in-hospital mortality rates, patient safety, as measured by AHRQ, and improved pain scores. Resident surveys demonstrated perceived improvement in patient care and education. Continued observation will be necessary to assess the long-term effect of the hospitalist comanagement service on quality metrics.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimens after placement of Viabahn stent graft (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease.\nClinical, angiographic, and procedural data for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease using Viabahn covered stent grafts at a single institution between 2006 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Graft patency and freedom from thrombolysis, major adverse limb event, and reintervention were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The influence of relevant variables on clinical outcome was determined through univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.\nViabahn stent grafts were placed in a total of 91 limbs in 61 patients (66% men; mean age, 69 \u00b1 12 years) during the study period. Indication for intervention was either claudication (n = 59) or critical limb ischemia (n = 32), with the majority (70%) classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C (n = 33) or D (n = 31) lesions. Mean follow-up was 38.3 months (range, 1-91 months). Postprocedural pharmacologic regimens included aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin (47%); indefinite aspirin and clopidogrel (46%); or aspirin and temporary clopidogrel (7%). Primary and secondary patency rates were 60%, 44%, and 36% and 95%, 82%, and 74% at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated more aggressive antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimens to be associated with improved primary patency and freedom from reintervention. Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II D lesions, tobacco use, coronary artery disease, and smaller stent diameter to be independent risk factors for stent graft failure. Bleeding events were limited to those in the aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin group (11.6% [n = 5]; P = .052), although the majority of these events were not life-threatening, and only two cases required blood transfusion.\nIncreasingly aggressive antithrombotic regimens after Viabahn stent graft placement trended toward improved overall clinical outcomes, although the marginal patency benefit observed with the addition of warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy was tempered by an observed increased risk of bleeding complications. Longer term follow-up and multicenter studies are needed to further define optimal type and duration of antithrombotic therapy after endovascular peripheral interventions.",

    "abstract": "Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders allow patients to communicate their wishes regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although DNR status may influence physician decision making regarding resuscitation, the effect of DNR status on outcomes of patients undergoing emergency vascular operation remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of DNR status on the outcomes of emergency vascular surgery.\nThe National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried to identify all patients requiring emergency vascular surgical interventions between 2005 and 2010. Demographics, clinical data, and outcomes were extracted. Patients were compared according to DNR status. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality.\nDuring the study period, 16,678 patients underwent emergency vascular operations (10.8% of the total vascular surgery population). Of those, 548 patients (3.3%) had a DNR status. The differences in rates of open or endovascular repair or of intraoperative blood requirement between the two groups were not significant. After adjusting for differences in demographics and clinical data, DNR patients were more likely to have higher rates of graft failure (8.7% vs 2.4%; adjusted P < .01) and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation (14.9 % vs 9.9%; adjusted P < .001). DNR status was associated with a 2.5-fold rise in 30-day mortality (35.0% vs 14.0%; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.9; adjusted P < .001).\nThe presence of a DNR order was independently associated with mortality. Patient and family counseling on surgical expectations before emergency vascular operations is warranted because the risks of perioperative events are significantly elevated when a DNR order exists.",

We reviewed the risk factors, clinical features, computed tomography images, follow-up results, and aortic remodeling of these IAAD patients and propose a new morphologic classification into three types-supraceliac, paravisceral, and infrarenal-according to the location of the primary entry site.\nThere were four supraceliac IAADs, one paravisceral IAAD, and 23 infrarenal IAADs in our case series. Suprarenal (supraceliac + paravisceral) IAAD patients were relatively younger than infrarenal patients (45.2 \u00b1 8.6 years vs 60.6 \u00b1 15.5 years; P < .05). No difference was observed between suprarenal and infrarenal IAADs with respect to true lumen, false lumen, and dissection length on imaging (P > .05). All patients received endovascular treatment. The primary technical success rate was 100%. During a follow-up of 35.7 \u00b1 19.9 months, only one infrarenal patient needed an endovascular reintervention. All patients with supraceliac or infrarenal IAADs were alive at the time of follow-up; however, a paravisceral patient died of a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture 21 months after endovascular treatment. In the suprarenal and infrarenal groups, endovascular treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the false lumen size and increase in the true lumen size (P < .05). The maximum abdominal aorta diameter decreased after endovascular treatment in both groups but was statistically significant only in the infrarenal group (P < .05).\nIAAD is a rare vascular disease. We propose it should be categorized as supraceliac, paravisceral, and infrarenal IAAD according to the location of the primary entry site. Endovascular treatment for supraceliac and infrarenal IAADs is a safe method with a high technical success rate and promising aortic remodeling, whereas endovascular treatment for paravisceral IAADs remains difficult.",

The primary technical success rate was 100%. During a follow-up of 35.7 \u00b1 19.9 months, only one infrarenal patient needed an endovascular reintervention. All patients with supraceliac or infrarenal IAADs were alive at the time of follow-up; however, a paravisceral patient died of a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture 21 months after endovascular treatment. In the suprarenal and infrarenal groups, endovascular treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the false lumen size and increase in the true lumen size (P < .05). The maximum abdominal aorta diameter decreased after endovascular treatment in both groups but was statistically significant only in the infrarenal group (P < .05).",

    "abstract": "Common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) for limited arterial occlusive disease is considered a fairly low-risk operation of short duration. This study investigated the timing of 30-day outcomes as they related to hospital discharge and predicted the risk of operative mortality of this procedure.\nAll patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent isolated CFE between 2005 and 2010 were selected for the test sample. We identified postoperative mortality and morbidities occurring before and after hospital discharge. A risk calculator for 30-day mortality, developed in the test sample using logistic regression, was validated in a new sample of cases from 2011 to 2012.\nA total of 1843 CFEs reported from 2005 to 2010 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The average operative time was 146 \u00b1 69.5 minutes (median, 133; interquartile range, 98-179 minutes), and 10% of patients needed to return to the operating room. The average length of stay was 4 \u00b1 7.5 days (median, 3; interquartile range, 2-5 days); 91% of patients were discharged \u2264 1 week of surgery. Occurrences of cardiovascular events, renal dysfunction, and pulmonary complication were relatively low. There was 3.4% mortality and 8% wound-related complications, 30% and 86% of which occurred after hospital discharge, respectively. Overall, there was a 15% risk of combined mortality/morbidity, and >60% of these events occurred after discharge. The independent predictors of 30-day mortality were age, nonindependent functional status, preoperative dialysis, sepsis, emergency status, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification 4 or 5, and the association between risk strata and death in the validation sample was strong (\u03c6 = 0.29) and significant (P < .001).\nCFE is not as \"benign\" a procedure as previously believed. The risks of death and wound complications are not insignificant, and a high percentage of these complications occurred after patients were discharged from the hospital. Patients should be carefully selected, especially in the elderly population, and close postoperative follow-up should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery relies on balancing the risk of the intervention against the risk of the aneurysm causing death. Although much is known about intervention at 5.5 cm, little is known about the fate of the patient unfit for elective surgery at this threshold. Medical therapy and endovascular surgery have revolutionized management of aortic aneurysms in the last 20 years and are thought to have affected rupture rates.\nMEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Database were searched for studies reporting follow-up of untreated large AAA approach from inception to January 2014. Data were pooled using random-effects analysis with standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported. The primary end points were rupture rates and all-cause mortality per year by AAA size.\nThe search strategy identified 1892 citations, of which 11 studies comprising 1514 patients experiencing 347 ruptured AAA were included. The overall incidence of ruptured AAA in patients with AAA >5.5 cm was 5.3% (95% CI, 3.1%-7.5%) per year. This represented cumulative yearly rupture rates of 3.5% (95% CI, -1.6% to 8.7%) in AAAs 5.5 to 6.0 cm, 4.1% (95% CI, -0.7% to 9.0%) in AAAs 6.1 to 7.0 cm, and 6.3% (95% CI, -1.8% to 14.3%) in AAAs >7.0 cm. There was no heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 0%). Only 32% of these patients were offered repair on rupturing an AAA, with a perioperative mortality of 58% (95% CI, 32%-83%). The risk of death from causes other than AAA was higher than the risk of death from rupture.\nRupture rates of untreated AAA were lower than those currently quoted in the literature. Non-AAA-related mortality in this group of patients is high.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) remains one of those neurodegenerative diseases for which the cause remains unknown. Many clinically diagnosed cases of IPD are associated with cerebrovascular disease and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of transverse sinus and extracranial venous abnormalities in IPD patients and their relationship with brain WMHs.\nTwenty-three IPD patients and 23 age-matched normal controls were recruited in this study. They had conventional neurologic magnetic resonance structural and angiographic scans and, for blood flow, quantification of the extracranial vessels. Venous structures were evaluated with two-dimensional time of flight; flow was evaluated with two-dimensional phase contrast; and WMH volume was quantified with T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. The IPD and normal subjects were classified by both the magnetic resonance time-of-flight and phase contrast images into four categories: (1) complete or local missing transverse sinus and internal jugular veins on the time-of-flight images; (2) low flow in the transverse sinus and stenotic internal jugular veins; (3) reduced flow in the internal jugular veins; and (4) normal flow and no stenosis.\nBroken into the four categories with categories 1 to 3 combined, a significant difference in the distribution of the IPD patients and normal controls (\u03c7(2) = 7.7; P < .01) was observed. Venous abnormalities (categories 1, 2, and 3) were seen in 57% of IPD subjects and in only 30% of controls. In IPD subjects, category type correlated with both flow abnormalities and WMHs.\nFrom this preliminary study, we conclude that a major fraction of IPD patients appear to have abnormal venous anatomy and flow on the left side of the brain and neck and that the flow abnormalities appear to correlate with WMH volume. Studies with a larger sample size are still needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of arteriogenesis, angiogenesis, and ischemic muscle tissue composition toward reperfusion after arterial occlusion are largely unknown. Differential loss of bone marrow-derived cell (BMC) matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which has been implicated in all of these processes, was used to assess the relative contributions of these processes during limb reperfusion.\nWe compared collateral growth (arteriogenesis), capillary growth (angiogenesis), and ischemic muscle tissue composition after femoral artery ligation in FVB/NJ mice that had been reconstituted with bone marrow from wild-type or MMP9(-/-) mice.\nLaser Doppler perfusion imaging confirmed decreased reperfusion capacity in mice with BMC-specific loss of MMP9; however, collateral arteriogenesis was not affected. Furthermore, when accounting for the fact that muscle tissue composition changes markedly with ischemia (ie, necrotic, fibroadipose, and regenerating tissue regions are present), angiogenesis was also unaffected. Instead, BMC-specific loss of MMP9 caused an increase in the proportion of necrotic and fibroadipose tissue, which showed the strongest correlation with poor perfusion recovery. Similarly, the reciprocal loss of MMP9 from non-BMCs showed similar deficits in perfusion and tissue composition without affecting arteriogenesis.\nBy concurrently analyzing arteriogenesis, angiogenesis, and ischemic tissue composition, we determined that the loss of BMC-derived or non-BMC-derived MMP9 impairs necrotic and fibroadipose tissue clearance after femoral artery ligation, despite normal arteriogenic and angiogenic vascular growth. These findings imply that therapeutic revascularization strategies for treating peripheral arterial disease may benefit from additionally targeting necrotic tissue clearance or skeletal muscle regeneration, or both.",

Furthermore, when accounting for the fact that muscle tissue composition changes markedly with ischemia (ie, necrotic, fibroadipose, and regenerating tissue regions are present), angiogenesis was also unaffected. Instead, BMC-specific loss of MMP9 caused an increase in the proportion of necrotic and fibroadipose tissue, which showed the strongest correlation with poor perfusion recovery. Similarly, the reciprocal loss of MMP9 from non-BMCs showed similar deficits in perfusion and tissue composition without affecting arteriogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The protective effects of female gender on the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen. Estrogen synthesis is dependent on the enzyme aromatase, which is located both centrally in the ovaries and peripherally in adipose tissue, bone, and vascular smooth muscle cells. It is hypothesized that deletion of aromatase in both ovarian and peripheral tissues would diminish the protective effect of female gender and would be associated with increased aortic diameter in female mice.\nMale and female 8- to 10-week-old mice with aromatase (wild type: WT) and without aromatase (ArKO) underwent elastase aortic perfusion with aortic harvest 14 days following. For the contribution of central and peripheral estrogen conversion to be evaluated, female WT mice were compared with female WT and ArKO mice that had undergone ovariectomy (ovx) at 6 weeks followed by elastase perfusion at 8 to 10 weeks. At aortic harvest, maximal aortic dilation was measured and samples were collected for immunohistochemistry and protein analysis. Serum was collected for serum estradiol concentrations. Groups were compared with analysis of variance. Human and mouse AAA cross sections were analyzed with confocal immunohistochemistry for aromatase, smooth muscle markers, and macrophage markers.\nFemale WT mice had significant reduction in aortic dilation compared with male WT mice (F WT, 51.5% \u00b1 15.1% vs M WT, 78.7% \u00b1 14.9%; P < .005). The protective effects of female gender were completely eliminated with deletion of aromatase (F ArKO, 82.6% \u00b1 13.8%; P < .05 vs F WT). Ovariectomy increased aortic dilation in WT mice (F WT ovx, 70.6% \u00b1 11.7%; P < .05 vs F WT). Aromatase deletion with ovariectomy further increased aortic dilation compared with WT ovx mice (F ArKO ovx, 87.3% \u00b1 14.7%, P < .001 vs F WT and P < .05 vs F WT ovx). Accordingly, female ArKO ovx mice had significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 and were associated with increased macrophage staining and decreased elastin staining. Regarding serum hormone levels, decreasing estradiol levels correlated with increasing aortic diameter (R = -0.565; P < .01). By confocal immunohistochemistry, both human and mouse AAA smooth muscle cells (smooth muscle \u03b1-actin positive) and macrophages (CD68 positive or Mac-2 positive) expressed aromatase.\nThe protective effect of female gender on AAAs is due to estrogen synthesis and requires the presence of both ovarian and extragonadal/peripheral aromatase. Peripheral estrogen synthesis accounts for roughly half of the protective effect of female gender. If peripheral aromatase could be targeted, high levels of local estrogen could be produced and may avoid the side effects of systemic estrogen.",

    "abstract": "The local delivery of paclitaxel onto a graft has been reported to prevent neointimal hyperplasia. Because more than half of vascular stenoses occur within 3 cm of the venous anastomosis, this study tested the effectiveness of a paclitaxel coating restricted to both ends of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft to reduce the amount of drug delivered.\nBoth ends of ePTFE grafts were coated with paclitaxel at a dose of 0.58 \u03bcg/mm(2); the total amount of paclitaxel per graft was 0.66 mg. Paclitaxel-coated hemodialysis grafts 15 cm in length were surgically implanted between the common carotid artery and external jugular vein in female Landrace pigs. The animals were sacrificed 6 weeks after graft placement. Cross sections of the anastomosis sites were analyzed histomorphometrically to measure the ratio of neointimal hyperplasia to the graft area (H/G ratio) and the percentage of luminal stenosis. The experimental results were compared between grafts coated with paclitaxel at the ends only (n = 8), grafts coated over the entire length (n = 6), and uncoated control grafts (n = 6).\nThe mean \u00b1 standard error values of the H/G ratios for the arterial anastomosis were 0.82 \u00b1 0.13 (control), 0.41 \u00b1 0.09 (terminal coating), and 0.21 \u00b1 0.04 (whole coating). The values for the venous anastomosis were 0.82 \u00b1 0.12 (control), 0.39 \u00b1 0.11 (terminal coating), and 0.12 \u00b1 0.03 (whole coating). Compared with the uncoated grafts, neointimal hyperplasia was suppressed effectively in the vascular grafts coated terminally with paclitaxel (artery, P = 050; vein, P < .001). However, the suppressive effect was less than that of grafts coated with paclitaxel over the entire length. The percentages of luminal stenosis showed similar tendency to the H/G ratios.\nDespite a reduced amount of the drug, paclitaxel coating applied to both ends of the ePTFE hemodialysis grafts effectively suppressed neointimal hyperplasia at the sites of anastomosis.",

    "abstract": "Embolization of carotid stenotic plaques is the direct cause of stroke in nearly 20% of cases. Genetic mechanisms and especially the roles played by microRNAs in the regulation of plaque destabilization and rupture are mostly unknown. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the expression of seven microRNAs allegedly involved in plaque growth and instability (miR-100, 125a, 127, 133a, 145, 155, and 221), between symptomatic and asymptomatic human carotid plaques.\nThirty patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in our department were prospectively included. Carotid plaques were subdivided into symptomatic (n\u00a0= 15) and asymptomatic (n\u00a0= 15) according to the presence or absence of stroke. After isolation of total RNA from atherosclerotic plaques, microRNAs were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nThe two groups of patients were comparable in terms of age, gender, risk factors for cerebral ischemia, medication, and stenosis severity. All seven microRNAs were quantified in extracted carotid plaques. miR-100, miR-125a, miR-127, miR-133a, miR-145, and miR-221 were significantly overexpressed in symptomatic vs asymptomatic plaques. miR-125a expression was significantly inversely correlated with the circulating level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the symptomatic group.\nThis pilot study evaluated the expression of seven selected miRNAs in human carotid plaques from a small group of patients and suggested a potential regulatory role for these miRNAs in evolution of the plaque towards growth, instability and rupture. Studies based on larger sample sizes are required to determine the potential use of miR-100, miR-125a, miR-127, miR-133a, miR-145, and miR-221 as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for stroke.",

The objective of our study was to add our data with a mean follow-up of 32\u00a0months to the existing data available.\nPatients undergoing iliac bifurcation procedure either as standalone or in combination with abdominal aortic aneurysm exclusion at two vascular centers had data prospectively gathered between 2004 and 2014. Collected data was analyzed for baseline characteristics, procedural events, and clinical follow-up; variables included endoleaks, reinterventions, and internal iliac artery (IIA) closure.\nA total of 45 iliac vessels in 41 patients (36 male) with a mean age of 70.4\u00a0years were treated with the iliac branched device. Procedural success was achieved in 85% (35/41) of patients and 87% (39/45) vessels with no intraoperative death. Of the six technical failures, three occurred due to failure to place the straight iliac branched device or stent properly. Two occurred because of endoleaks at the end of the procedure, and one occurred because the IIA side-branch occluded and could not be reopened. The mean patient follow-up was 32.0\u00a0\u00b1 27.3\u00a0months (range, 0-109\u00a0months). During this time period, the IIA patency rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 81%, and the freedom from endoleak rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 76% per patient. The freedom from reintervention per patient was 75%. No patient reported symptoms of pelvic ischemia and permanent buttock claudication.\nIn this study with mean follow-up of 32\u00a0months, treatment with iliac bifurcated devices is a safe and durable option in a carefully selected population of patients with iliac artery bifurcation aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes the DEDE (Door-from-Emergency to Door-to-EVAR [endovascular aneurysm repair]) time as a new metric for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) delay time to surgery, permitting coherent centralization in large territories. It demonstrates how the DEDE time can be applied, using data from the province of Quebec, and looks at its potential effect on 30-day mortality.\nWe used the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS), the linkage of five health administrative databases, to build a retrospective cohort of RAAA patients repaired operatively between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2013. A validated algorithm was used to identify open surgical repair (OSR) and EVAR patients. Hospitals performing these operations were further characterized according to their location, volume of RAAA, types of surgeries (OSR vs EVAR), and surgeon's volume. Logistic and log-binomial regression analyses identified the risk of 30-day mortality with age, sex, hospital volume, and surgical groups as variables. Using the DEDE 90 metric and the attributable fraction, we projected how centralization and increasing the number of EVAR would affect the 30-day mortality.\nAmong patients aged \u226565 years, 895 RAAAs were identified. OSR was performed in 839 patients (93.7%) and EVAR in 56 (6.3%). The overall 30-day mortality was 34.4%, and more specifically, was 35.5% for OSR compared with 17.9% for EVAR (P = .0046). RAAAs were treated in 39 hospitals, including 16 centers averaging less than one RAAA repair per year. Low-volume (39.4%) vs high-volume centers (32.5%) had similar 30-day mortality (P = .2198). In the multivariate analysis, the relative risk for OSR was 1.95 (P = .0211) and was not significant for hospital volume. Applying the DEDE 90 metric and increasing access to EVAR to 50% of patients, the overall 30-day mortality would be 26.8%.\nDEDE 90 is a new metric for a coherent centralization model, particularly in large territories, where transport time is crucial. Increasing access to EVAR performed in high-volume centers, with consideration to transport time, could improve the 30-day mortality after a RAAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to analyze periprocedural and 1-year outcomes of peripheral endovascular intervention (PVI) for critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nWe reviewed 1244 patients undergoing 1414 PVIs for CLI (rest pain, 29%; tissue loss, 71%) within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) from January 2010 to December 2011. Overall survival (OS), amputation-free survival (AFS), and freedom from major amputation at 1 year were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nThe number of arteries treated during each procedure were 1 (49%), 2 (35%), 3 (12%), and \u22654 (5%). Target arterial segments and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classifications were aortoiliac, 27% (A, 48%; B, 28%; C, 12%; and D, 12%); femoral-popliteal, 48% (A, 29%; B, 34%; C, 20%; and D, 17%); and infrapopliteal, 25% (A, 17%; B, 14%; C, 25%; D, 44%). Technical success was 92%. Complications included access site hematoma (5.0%), occlusion (0.3%), and distal embolization (2.4%). Mortality and major amputation rates were 2.8% and 2.2% at 30 days, respectively. Overall percutaneous or open reintervention rate was 8.0% during the first year. At 1-year, OS, AFS, and freedom from major amputation were 87%, 87%, and 94% for patients with rest pain and 80%, 71%, and 81% for patients with tissue loss. Independent predictors of reduced 1-year OS (C index = .74) included dialysis (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.8-5.1; P < .01), emergency procedure (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-6.2; P = .05), age >80 years (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7-2.8; P < .01), not living at home preoperatively (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8; P < .01), creatinine >1.8 mg/dL (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8; P < .01), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2; P < .01), and chronic \u03b2-blocker use (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9; P = .03), whereas independent preoperative ambulation (HR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9; P = .014) was protective. Independent predictors of major amputation (C index = .69) at 1 year included dialysis (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5; P < .01), tissue loss (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; P = .02), prior major contralateral amputation (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .02), non-Caucasian race (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9; P = .045), and male gender (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; P = .03), whereas smoking (HR, .60; 95% CI, 0.4-1.0; P = .042) was protective.\nSurvival and major amputation after PVI for CLI are associated with different patient characteristics. Dialysis dependence is a common predictor that portends especially poor outcomes. These data may facilitate efforts to improve patient selection and, after further validation, enable risk-adjusted outcome reporting for CLI patients undergoing PVI.",

    "abstract": "Unexplained aneurysm growth despite multimodality imaging after endovascular aneurysm repair is often attributed to endotension. We tested a hypothesis that endotension may be from a type Ia endoleak pressurizing the aneurysm sac, without net forward flow, not visualized on standard angiographic imaging.\nA patient-specific aortic aneurysm phantom was constructed of polyvinyl alcohol using three-dimensional molding techniques. A bifurcated stent graft was implanted, and the phantom was connected to a hemodynamic simulator for testing. Type Ia endoleaks were created using 7F catheters. Three scenarios were studied: complete exclusion (no endoleak), inflow with no sac outflow, and inflow with sac outflow. Imaging with digital subtraction angiography was performed at 48 kVp at 5 frames/s, followed by delayed imaging at 1 frame/min for 30\u00a0minutes.\nWith no endoleak, the systemic pressure averaged 113\u00a0mm Hg and aneurysm sac pressure averaged 101\u00a0mm Hg. With an endoleak present without outflow, the systemic pressure averaged 116\u00a0mm Hg, the aneurysm sac pressure averaged 120\u00a0mm Hg, and endoleak flow was bidirectional with no net forward flow. With endoleak present with aneurysm sac outflow, the systemic pressure averaged 119\u00a0mm Hg, aneurysm sac pressure averaged 105.5\u00a0mm Hg, and net endoleak flow into the aneurysm sac was 21\u00a0mL/min across the endoleak channel. With digital subtraction imaging, the endoleak with no outflow was noted after >9\u00a0minutes of delayed imaging.\nIn our model, the creation of a type Ia endoleak in the absence of sac outflow resulted in a mean pressure higher than the systemic mean pressure with zero net flow into the aneurysm sac. Consequently, the endoleak could only be visualized with markedly delayed imaging and not with standard contrast digital subtraction angiography like that used in clinical practice. Our findings suggest that endotension may in fact be the result of undetected endoleaks secondary to the limitations of present iodinated contrast imaging modalities.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated changes in aortic neck diameter after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using a balloon-expandable stent (BES) endograft compared with a commercially available self-expanding stent (SES) endograft. We hypothesized that forces applied to the aortic neck by SES endografts may induce aortic neck enlargement over time and that such enlargement may not occur in aneurysm patients treated with a device that does not use a proximal SES.\nThis was a retrospective quantitative computed tomography (CT) image analysis of patients treated with the Nellix (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) BES (n = 49) or the Endurant II (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) SES (n = 56) endograft from 2008 to 2010. Patients with preimplant, postimplant, and at least 1-year serial CT scans underwent quantitative morphometric assessment by two independent vascular radiologists blinded to the outcome results. Changes in the infrarenal neck over time were compared with the suprarenal aorta for each patient.\nFollow-up extended to 4.8 years for the BES and to 4.6 years for the SES, with no significant difference in median follow-up time (34 months for BESs and 24 months for SESs; P = .06). There were no differences in preimplant neck diameter (25.2 \u00b1 0.9 mm vs 25.7 \u00b1 1.1 mm; P = .54) or length (27.7 \u00b1 3.7 mm vs 23.6 \u00b1 3.7 mm; P = .12) between BESs and SESs at baseline. After implantation, neck diameter increased by 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 mm in BES patients and 2.6 \u00b1 0.5 mm in SES patients (P = .07) compared with the preoperative diameter. At 3 years, neck diameter increased by 0.5 \u00b1 0.9 mm in BES patients and by 3.8 \u00b1 1.0 mm in SES patients (P = .0002) compared with the first postoperative CT scan. The annual postimplant rate of increase in the infrarenal neck diameter was fivefold greater in SES patients (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y) than in BES patients (0.22 \u00b1 0.04 mm/y; P < .0001). There were no significant differences in the diameter of the suprarenal aorta at baseline or at 3 years and no differences in the annual rate of change in suprarenal aortic diameter between BES and SES endografts.\nEVAR using SES endografts resulted in progressive infrarenal aortic neck enlargement, whereas EVAR using BES endografts resulted in no neck enlargement over time. These data suggest that infrarenal neck enlargement after EVAR with SES endografts is likely related to the force exerted by SES elements rather than disease progression in the infrarenal neck.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery aneurysms are rare in the general population, although the true incidence and natural history remain elusive. Controversy over criteria for repair persists across decades. Indications for repair presently include aneurysm size >2 cm, female gender within childbearing age, symptoms like pain and hematuria, medically refractory hypertension including that associated with functionally important renal artery stenosis, thromboembolism, dissection, and rupture. Conventional surgical reconstruction options are variable and continue to offer technically sound and durable results. Endovascular therapies with novel devices also offer technical success with few major adverse events, and are increasingly employed as indications for intervention broaden. This review summarizes the accumulated evidence on true renal artery aneurysms with a particular focus on contemporary treatment criteria, natural history, options for repair and outcomes following such.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated stent grafts are subject to the same hemodynamic forces that have resulted in migration of standard infrarenal stent grafts. Outcome data for fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair consist of short-term and midterm efficacy studies where migration was generally poorly investigated. This study investigated the migration of fenestrated stent grafts in patients treated by fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair in the United Kingdom.\nA total of 154 patients were retrospectively enrolled from nine sites across the United Kingdom. Patients had been treated with a Zenith fenestrated endograft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) between 2003 and 2010. Patients were required to have a baseline (first) postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan and at least one additional CT scan available. Measurements from the proximal stent graft to the superior mesenteric artery and from the distal stent graft to the iliac bifurcation were performed on the first postoperative CT scan. These measurements were repeated on all subsequent CT scans, and differences between the baseline and subsequent CT scans for the same anatomical location were suggestive of device migration. Migration was defined as cranial (-) or caudal (+) movement of the stent graft of \u22654 mm.\nProximal migration (median, +6.0 mm; range, +4.1 to +10.0 mm) was evident in 33 patients (21%). The probability of being free from proximal migration at 12, 24, and 36 months was estimated as 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75%-89%), 77% (95% CI, 70%-85%), and 77% (95% CI, 70%-85%), respectively. Of 259 limbs assessed, 34 (13%) showed evidence of cranial migration (median, -6.1 mm; range, -21.3 to -4.1 mm). The observed probability of being free from any iliac limb migration at 12, 24, and 36 months was 85% (95% CI, 79%-92%), 82% (95% CI, 75%-90%), and 65% (95% CI, 52%-80%), respectively.\nProximal migration occurs in approximately one-third of patients by 4 years, all migration was caudal in direction, with 60% <6.0 mm in length. Clinical sequelae were infrequent, with no statistically significant differences in the number of complications or reinterventions in patients with and without proximal migration.",

    "abstract": "As vascular surgery training paradigms evolve, one measure of success is operative experience. This study assessed the initial operative experience of those graduating from new integrated programs (0+5) vs those from the traditional programs (5+2).\nNational operative case log data supplied by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education was compiled for vascular surgical residents graduating between 2010 and 2013. Mean case numbers for the 0+5 residents were compared with those for the 5+2 residents (experience from their general surgery residency plus vascular fellowship) for total vascular operations, open vascular operations, endovascular procedures, and total operative experience.\nThe 5+2 trainees performed significantly more procedures than the 0+5 trainees (mean, 1605 vs 1015); however, they performed 12% less vascular procedures (mean, 758 vs 851). No significant differences in total number of open vascular operations (mean, 404 vs 411) or specific open operations for cerebral vascular disease, aneurysm, peripheral obstruction, and access were found. The increase in vascular procedures logged by 0+5 trainees was realized by a 24% increase in endovascular procedures, mainly involving diagnostic arteriography, caval filter placement, and balloon angioplasty. No significant differences were seen in endovascular aneurysm repair (mean, 63 vs 60) and stent placement (mean, 59 vs 60).\nThis report summarizes the first data available for the 0+5 trainee operative experience. Compared with the traditional 5+2 trainees, the 0+5 trainees have (1) equivalent open vascular training and (2) overall superior endovascular training, although this was accounted via an increase in minor procedures. The overall operative experience remains greater for the 5+2 trainees secondary to 2 extra years of training. Further longitudinal studies will be needed to fully characterize the effect of the new 0+5 training paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to characterize the predictive impact of computed tomography (CT) scan volumetric analysis on the natural history of acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissections (ADs).\nWe conducted a retrospective review of patients with acute type B ADs from 2009 to 2014. On an iNtuition workstation (TeraRecon, Foster City, Calif), volume measurements were obtained using the true lumen volume (TLV), false lumen volume (FLV), and total aortic volume from the left subclavian artery to the celiac artery. Growth rate was calculated as the change in maximal diameter between first and last available CT scans during the time interval. The primary outcome of the study was delayed aortic intervention. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.\nDuring a 5-year period, 164 patients had CT scan evidence of acute type B ADs; 11 patients were excluded for lack of subsequent follow-up imaging; 36 patients who underwent urgent repair (<14 days from presentation) were also excluded. We evaluated a total of 117 patients: 85 patients who did not require intervention and 32 who underwent delayed (>14 days) thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (29) or open repair (3). Mean age was 66 \u00b1 12 years. Mean TLV/FLV ratio on initial CT scan was significantly higher in patients who did not eventually require an operation (1.55 vs 0.82; P = .02). The mean growth rate was higher in those eventually requiring operation (2.47 vs 0.42 mm/mo; P = .003). Patients were divided into three subgroups on the basis of their initial imaging TLV/FLV ratios (<0.8, 0.8-1.6, and >1.6). There was a significant difference in the growth rates between these three groups (4.6 vs 2.4 vs 0.8 mm/mo; P < .025). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a TLV/FLV ratio <0.8 was highly predictive for requiring an intervention (area = 0.8; sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 84%: positive predictive value, 71%; negative predictive value, 81%), with an odds ratio of 12.2 (confidence interval, 5-26; P < .001). Conversely, a TLV/FLV ratio of >1.6 was highly predictive for freedom from delayed operation (sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 42%; positive predictive value, 61%; negative predictive value, 86%). After Kaplan-Meier analysis, 1-year and 2-year survival free of aortic interventions was 60% and 42% with a TLV/FLV ratio <0.8 and 92% and 82% with a ratio >1.6 (P = .001).\nInitial CT scan volumetric analysis in patients presenting with uncomplicated acute type B ADs is a useful tool to predict growth and need for future intervention.",

Kaplan-Meier analysis, stratified by indication, was used to assess relationships between gender and the main outcome measures of major amputation, reintervention, and survival during the first year.\nIndications for PVI included claudication (n = 719 [38%] vs n = 1173 [62%]) and CLI (n = 597 [41%] vs n = 849 [59%]) in women and men, respectively (P = .0028). Women were older (69 vs 66 mean years; P < .00001), with less diabetes (43% vs 49%; P = .01), renal insufficiency (4.6% vs 7.3%; P = .0029), coronary artery disease (28% vs 35%; P < .00001), smoking (76% vs 86%; P = .01), and statin use (60% vs 64%; P = .0058). Technical success (95% vs 94%; P = .11), vascular injury (1.3% vs 1.0%; P = .82), and distal embolization (1.6% vs 1.3%; P = .46) were similar. Higher rates of hematoma (7.1% vs 3.4%; P \u2264 .0001) and access site occlusion (0.91% vs 0.24%; P = .0085) were observed in women compared with men. There were no differences in major amputation (0.6% vs 0.6%; P = .81) or mortality (2.1% vs 1.5%; P = .20) rates at 30 days between women and men. Reinterventions (surgical and percutaneous) were similar between genders for claudicants (log-rank test, P = .75) and CLI patients (log-rank test, P = .93). Major amputation rates during the first year were not different for women and men and with claudication (log-rank test, P < .55) or CLI (log-rank test, P < .23). One-year survival was not different between women and men with claudication (95% vs 96%; P = .19) or CLI (77% vs 79%; P = .35).\nWhereas we observed higher rates of access site complications including hematoma and occlusion in women, we found no other evidence for gender disparity in reinterventions, major amputation, or survival rates after PVI for patients with claudication or CLI.",

By comparison, longer bridging stents provide more gradual changes in momentum, thus allowing blood flow to develop before reaching the target vessel.",

    "abstract": "Patients who undergo endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease vary greatly in lesion complexity and treatment options. This study examined the association of lesion severity and cost of SFA stenting and to determine if procedure cost affects primary patency at 1 year.\nA retrospective record review identified patients undergoing initial SFA stenting between January 1, 2010, and February 1, 2012. Medical records were reviewed to collect data on demographics, comorbidities, indication for the procedure, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II severity, and primary patency. The interventional radiology database and hospital accounting database were queried to determine cost drivers of SFA stenting. Procedure supply cost included any item with a bar code used for the procedure. Associations between cost drivers and lesion characteristics were explored. Primary patency was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a log-rank test.\nDuring the study period, 95 patients underwent stenting in 98 extremities; of these, 61% of SFA stents were performed for claudication, with 80% of lesions classified as TASC II A or B. Primary patency at 1 year was 79% for the entire cohort. The mean total cost per case was $10,333. Increased procedure supply cost was associated with adjunct device use, the number of stents, and TASC II severity. Despite higher costs of treating more complex lesions, primary patency at 1 year was similar at 80% for high-cost (supply cost >$4000) vs 78% for low-cost (supply cost <$4000) interventions.\nSFA lesion complexity, as defined by TASC II severity, drives the cost of endovascular interventions but does not appear to disadvantage patency at 1 year. Reimbursement agencies should consider incorporating disease severity into reimbursement algorithms for lower extremity endovascular interventions.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the etiologic factors that lead to the occurrence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. Recent work has suggested that macrophages may play an important role in progression of a number of other vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis; however, whether these cells are present within the ILT of a progressing AAA is unknown. The purpose of this work was to define the presence, phenotype, and spatial distribution of macrophages within the ILT excised from six patients. We hypothesized that the ILT contains a population of activated macrophages with a distinct, nonclassical phenotypic profile.\nILT samples were examined using histologic staining and immunofluorescent labeling for multiple markers of activated macrophages (cluster of differentiation [CD]45, CD68, human leukocyte antigen-DR, matrix metalloproteinase 9) and the additional markers \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, CD34, CD105, fetal liver kinase-1, and collagen I and III.\nHistologic staining revealed a distinct laminar organization of collagen within the shoulder region of the ILT lumen and a spatially heterogeneous cell composition within the ILT. Most of the cellular constituents of the ILT were in the luminal region and predominantly expressed markers of activated macrophages but also concurrently expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, CD105, and synthesized collagen I and III.\nThis report presents evidence for the presence of a distinct macrophage population within the luminal region of AAA ILT. These cells express a set of markers indicative of a unique population of activated macrophages. The exact contributions of these previously unrecognized cells to ILT formation and AAA pathobiology remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare renal outcomes (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] and renal volume) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open repair (OR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nAll AAA repairs performed between November 2009 and July 2011 were included in this retrospective study. Patients requiring suprarenal clamping and renal bypass or reimplantation and patients requiring fenestrated endografting were excluded from the OR and EVAR groups, respectively. All EVARs were performed with transrenal proximal fixation. Renal volume (calculated with a three-dimensional workstation) and GFR (estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) were evaluated before the procedure, at 12 months after the procedure, and yearly thereafter.\nThe study included 90 patients (41 ORs and 49 EVARs). Both groups were comparable except for age at intervention, body mass index, smoking, peripheral arterial disease, arrhythmia, and vitamin K antagonist treatment. Median follow-up was 2.8 years for OR (2.5-2.9 years) and 3.2 years for EVAR (3.0-3.4 years). In both groups, we found a significant decrease when comparing postoperative estimated GFR with 1-year (14.4% decrease [3.8%-23.8%]; P = .002) and 3-year (12.8% decrease [3.8%-20.9%]; P = .0007) levels. In both groups, total renal volumes significantly diminished. Median preoperative total renal volume (372 cm(3) [311-349]) significantly decreased (6.7% [2.8%-10.5%]; P = .008) between 1 year and 2 years of follow-up.\nRenal function impairment is similar after open and endovascular AAA repair. It is associated with a decrease in total renal volume, which seems to be an early and constant marker of postoperative renal impairment.",

Both groups were comparable except for age at intervention, body mass index, smoking, peripheral arterial disease, arrhythmia, and vitamin K antagonist treatment. Median follow-up was 2.8 years for OR (2.5-2.9 years) and 3.2 years for EVAR (3.0-3.4 years). In both groups, we found a significant decrease when comparing postoperative estimated GFR with 1-year (14.4% decrease [3.8%-23.8%]; P = .002) and 3-year (12.8% decrease [3.8%-20.9%]; P = .0007) levels. In both groups, total renal volumes significantly diminished. Median preoperative total renal volume (372 cm(3) [311-349]) significantly decreased (6.7% [2.8%-10.5%]; P = .008) between 1 year and 2 years of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "To report an initial experience with physician-modified thoracic endografts for endovascular treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA).\nSingle-center cohort study of the treatment of TAAA using a physician-modified fenestrated thoracic endograft for patients deemed to be at high risk of open repair. The cohort includes 21 patients in a prospective physician-sponsored U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational device exemption study and three patients treated outside the investigational device exemption. The procedure involves physician modification of a Cook TX2 thoracic stent graft with reinforced fenestrations. Branch stents were iCast balloon expandable stents. Treatment success was defined as successful aneurysm exclusion with freedom from permanent organ system dysfunction and return to preoperative level of independent functional status.\nTwenty-four consecutive patients were treated. Twenty-one patients (88%) met the endpoint of treatment success at a mean of 11\u00a0months follow-up. One patient (4%) died within 30\u00a0days due to complications of spinal cord injury (SCI). One patient (4%) died 4\u00a0months postoperatively after a prolonged recovery from surgery. One other patient (4%) is alive 13\u00a0months after operation with permanent SCI. One renal reintervention has been required. No device failures have occurred.\nEarly-term data suggest that physician-modified fenestrated thoracic endografts can be used to safely and effectively treat TAAA in patients at high risk of open repair. Physician-modified devices perform similarly to commercially manufactured grafts in terms of treatment success, SCI, perioperative death, and clinical outcome at short-term follow-up. Physician modification is immediately available and allows for a high level of customizability. Procedure success is contingent upon careful preoperative planning, patient selection, experienced providers, and a high volume center.",

    "abstract": "Acceptable complication rates after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are drawn from decades-old data. The recent Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) demonstrated improved stroke and mortality outcomes after CEA compared with carotid artery stenting, with 30-day periprocedural CEA stroke rates of 3.2% and 1.4% for symptomatic (SX) and asymptomatic (ASX) patients, respectively. It is unclear whether these target rates can be attained in \"normal-risk\" (NR) patients experienced outside of the trial. This study was done to determine the contemporary results of CEA from a broader selection of NR patients.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Vascular Registry was examined to determine in-hospital and 30-day event rates for NR, SX, and ASX patients undergoing CEA. NR was defined as patients without anatomic or physiologic risk factors as defined by SVS Carotid Practice Guidelines. Raw data and risk-adjusted rates of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) were compared between the ASX and SX cohorts.\nThere were 3977 patients (1456 SX, 2521 ASX) available for comparison. The SX group consisted of more men (61.7% vs 57.0%; P = .0045) but reflected a lower proportion of white patients (91.3% vs 94.4%; P = .0002), with lower prevalence of coronary artery disease (P < .0001), prior MI (P < .0001), peripheral vascular disease (P = .0017), and hypertension (P = .029), although New York Heart Association grade >3 congestive heart failure was equally present in both groups (P = .30). Baseline stenosis >80% on duplex imaging was less prevalent among SX patients (54.2% vs 67.8%; P < .0001). Perioperative stroke rates were higher for SX patients in the hospital (2.8% vs 0.8%; P < .0001) and at 30 days (3.4% vs 1.0%; P < .0001), which contributed to the higher composite death, stroke, and MI rates in the hospital (3.6% vs 1.8; P = .0003) and at 30 days (4.5% vs 2.2%; P < .0001) observed in SX patients. After risk adjustment, the rate of stroke/death was greater among SX patients in the hospital (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.58) although not at 30 days (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-2.17). No in-hospital or 30-day differences were observed for death or MI by symptom status.\nThe SVS Vascular Registry results for CEA in NR patients are similar by symptom status to those reported for CREST and may serve as a benchmark for comparing results of alternative therapies for treatment of carotid stenosis in NR patients outside of monitored clinical trials. The contemporary perioperative risk of stroke after CEA in NR patients continues to be higher for SX than for ASX patients.",

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal circulation induces ischemia/reperfusion injury in the small intestinal wall. One reason for this damage is a perfusion shift from the muscular toward the mucosal layer. This study investigated the effect of this perfusion shift on the small-intestinal apoptosis and proliferation.\nTwenty-eight pigs were randomly assigned to the following cohorts and underwent a thoracolaparotomy and a 1\u00a0hour main procedure: cohort I: control; cohort II: thoracic aortic cross-clamping (TAC) without perfusion; cohort III: TAC and distal aortic perfusion (DAP); cohort IV: TAC, DAP, and selective visceral perfusion. The main procedure was followed by 2\u00a0hours of reperfusion in all cohorts. Tissue samples were taken during the experiment, stained, and analyzed for apoptosis and proliferation (caspase-3, annexin-V, terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxy uridine triphosphate nick-end labeling, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen). Six animals died unexpectedly during the experiment and were excluded from the analysis.\nExtensive tissue damage and necrosis was only found in cohort II after the main procedure. In the mucosa, the proliferation was increased in cohort III at the end of the experiment (P\u00a0= .0157 cohort I vs II). In contrast, the annexin-V/proliferating cell nuclear antigen ratio was significantly higher in cohorts II and IV than in cohorts I and II at the end of the experiment (P\u00a0= .0034). Furthermore, the caspase-3/annexin-V ratio was increased in all cohorts at the end of the experiment (P\u00a0= .0015).\nMucosal proliferation is the early repair mechanism of the limited small intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury after DAP. Furthermore, the extensive surgical trauma shifted the mucosal apoptosis into an advanced state.",

    "abstract": "A certain number of deaths may result from elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair due to inherent risks of operation; however, no agreement exists about which predictive model for in-hospital mortality is most accurate in predicting these events. This study developed a risk prediction model using Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) data and compared it with established models.\nVSGNE data (2003-2013) were queried for patients undergoing elective AAA repair by open or endovascular techniques. Clinical variables and known predictors of mortality were included in a full prediction model. Backward elimination with \u03b1\u00a0= .2 was used to construct a parsimonious model. This VSGNE model was compared with established models-Medicare, Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS), and Vascular Governance North West (VGNW)-based on the scope of VSGNE data collection. Model fit was compared with the Vuong test. Model discrimination was compared in equally sized risk-group VSGNE terciles.\nThe overall mortality rate for 4431 elective AAA patients was 1.4%. The discriminating ability of the VSGNE model was high (C statistic\u00a0= 0.822) and corrected slightly to 0.779 after internal validation. Vuong tests yielded significant overall fit difference favoring the VSGNE model over the Medicare (C statistic\u00a0= 0.769), VGNW (C statistic\u00a0= 0.767), and GAS (C statistic\u00a0= 0.685) models. The VGNW and Medicare models performed better than GAS in predicting mortality among risk-group terciles.\nThe VSGNE risk prediction model is best at forecasting mortality among this patient population. The Medicare and VGNW models showed good discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is growing in global prevalence and is associated with high rates of limb loss and mortality. However, a relevant gap of evidence about the most optimal treatment strategy still exists. The aim of this study of the prospective, multicenter First-Line Treatments in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (CRITISCH) registry was to assess the current practice of all first-line treatments strategies in CLI patients in German vascular centers.\nBetween January 2013 and September 2014, five first-line treatment strategies-endovascular revascularization (ER), bypass surgery (BS), femoral/profundal artery patchplasty (FAP), conservative treatment, and primary amputation-were determined among CLI patients in 27 vascular tertiary centers. The main composite end point was major amputation or death, or both, during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were hemodynamic failure, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events, and reintervention. Univariate logistic models were additionally built to preselect possible risk factors for either event, which were then used as candidates for a multivariate logistic model.\nThe study included 1200 consecutive patients. First-line treatment of choice was ER in 642 patients (53.4%), BS in 284 (23.7%), FAP in 126 (10.5%), conservative treatment in 118 (9.8%), and primary amputation in 30 (2.5%). The composite end point was met in 24 patients (4%) after ER, in 17 (6%) after BS, in 8 (6%) after FAP, and in 9 (8%) after conservative treatment (P = .172). The highest rate of in-hospital death was observed after primary amputation (10%) and of hemodynamic failure after conservative treatment (91%). Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events developed in 4% of patients after ER, in 5% after BS, in 6% after FAP, in 5% after conservative treatment, and in 13% after primary amputation. The reintervention rate was 8%, 14%, 6%, 5%, and 3% in each group, respectively. In the multivariate regression model, coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-6.17) and previous myocardial infarction (PMI) <6 months (OR, 3.67, 95% CI, 1.51-8.88) were identified as risk factors for the composite end point. Risk factors for amputation were dialysis (OR, 3.31, 95% CI, 1.44-7.58) and PMI (OR, 3.26, 95% CI, 1.23-8.36) and for death, BS compared with ER (OR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.10-10.0), renal insufficiency without dialysis (OR, 6.34; 95% CI, 1.71-23.5), and PMI (OR, 7.41; 95% CI, 2.11-26.0).\nThe CRITISCH registry revealed ER as the most common first-line approach in CLI patients. Coronary artery disease and PMI <6 months were independent risk factors for the composite end point. Special attention should be also paid to CLI patients with renal insufficiency, with or without dialysis, and those undergoing BS.",

First-line treatment of choice was ER in 642 patients (53.4%), BS in 284 (23.7%), FAP in 126 (10.5%), conservative treatment in 118 (9.8%), and primary amputation in 30 (2.5%). The composite end point was met in 24 patients (4%) after ER, in 17 (6%) after BS, in 8 (6%) after FAP, and in 9 (8%) after conservative treatment (P = .172). The highest rate of in-hospital death was observed after primary amputation (10%) and of hemodynamic failure after conservative treatment (91%). Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events developed in 4% of patients after ER, in 5% after BS, in 6% after FAP, in 5% after conservative treatment, and in 13% after primary amputation. The reintervention rate was 8%, 14%, 6%, 5%, and 3% in each group, respectively. In the multivariate regression model, coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-6.17) and previous myocardial infarction (PMI) <6 months (OR, 3.67, 95% CI, 1.51-8.88) were identified as risk factors for the composite end point. Risk factors for amputation were dialysis (OR, 3.31, 95% CI, 1.44-7.58) and PMI (OR, 3.26, 95% CI, 1.23-8.36) and for death, BS compared with ER (OR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.10-10.0), renal insufficiency without dialysis (OR, 6.34; 95% CI, 1.71-23.5), and PMI (OR, 7.41; 95% CI, 2.11-26.0).",

    "abstract": "Single-center experiences with the treatment of infected endografts after endovascular aortic repair (I-EVAR) have been reported. We performed a multicenter review of the surgical care of these patients to elucidate short-term and long-term outcomes.\nA retrospective analysis of all EVAR explants from 1997 to 2014 at four institutions was performed. Patients with I-EVAR undergoing surgical treatment were reviewed. Data were obtained detailing preoperative demographics, and postoperative morbidity and mortality.\nThirty-six patients (30 male) were treated with endovascular graft excision and revascularization for I-EVAR with a median age of 69 years (range, 54-80 years). Average time from the initial EVAR to presentation was 589 days (range, 43-2466 days). Preoperative comorbidities included hypertension, 32 (89%); tobacco use, 31(86%); coronary artery disease, 26 (72%); hyperlipidemia, 25 (69%), peripheral artery disease, 13 (36%); cerebrovascular disease, 10 (28%); diabetes, 10 (28%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 9 (25%); and chronic kidney disease, 9 (25%). The most common presenting patient characteristics were leukocytosis, 23 (63%); pain, 21 (58%); and fever, 20 (56%), which were present an average of 65 days (range, 0-514 days) before explantation. Nine different types of endograft were removed. Three patients (8%) underwent emergency explantation. Thirty-four patients (89%) underwent total graft excision, and two patients (6%) underwent partial excision. Methods of reconstruction were in situ in 27 (75%) and extra-anatomic in nine (28%). Conduits used were Dacron (DuPont, Wilmington, Del), with or without rifampin, polytetrafluoroethylene, cryopreserved allograft, and femoral vein. Forty-nine organisms grew from operative cultures. Gram-positive organisms were the most common, found in 24 (67%), including Staphylococcus in 13 (36%) and Streptococcus in six (17%). Anaerobes were cultured in 6 patients (17%), gram-negative organisms in 6 (17%), and fungus in 5 (14%). Thirty-one patients (86%) received long-term antibiotics. Early complications included acute renal failure requiring dialysis, 12 (33%); respiratory failure, 3 (8%); bleeding, 4 (11%); and sepsis, 2 (6%). Six patients required re-exploration due to hematoma, infected hematoma, lymphatic leak, bowel perforation, open abdomen at initial operation, and anastomotic bleeding. Perioperative mortality was 8% (3 of 36), and long-term mortality was 25% (9 of 36) at a mean follow-up of 569 days (range, 0-3079 days). Type of reconstruction (in situ vs extra-anatomic) or conduit type did not affect perioperative or overall mortality.\nI-EVAR is a rare but potentially devastating clinical problem. Although perioperative mortality is acceptable, long-term mortality is high. The most common postoperative complication was acute renal failure requiring dialysis. Although this is the largest series of I-EVAR, further studies are needed to understand the risk factors and preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid aortic arch reconstruction represents a treatment option for patients unsuitable for conventional open cardiovascular surgery. We analyzed patient outcome after hemiarch repair in zone 1 and zone 2 with regard to early and long-term results.\nBetween December 2004 and December 2012, a total of 47 patients underwent hemiarch repair for distal aortic arch disease. Supra-aortic debranching was performed in 23 patients for zone 1 (carotid-carotid crossover bypass) and in 24 patients for zone 2 (carotid-subclavian bypass/subclavian transposition) followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair. All patients included had been refused for open surgery or were emergency cases.\nMean age of the patients was 65.3 years; 51% of patients were symptomatic or presented with a contained aortic rupture. Overall technical success rate was 81%, with a 30-day mortality rate of 12.8%. A primary type Ia endoleak was observed in 19%. The mean follow-up period was 50.5 months (range, 1-93 months). Follow-up mortality was 14.9%; secondary endoleak rate was 8.5% for both groups. There was a trend of reduced primary type Ia endoleak rate for zone 2 repair compared with zone 1 (4.3% vs 14.9%; P = .07). Follow-up mortality was also improved for zone 2 repair (4.3% vs 10.6%; P = .41). Overall survival rate was 70%.\nHemiarch hybrid repair in high-risk patients is associated with an acceptable perioperative mortality risk and long-term survival. Zone 2 represents a feasible and effective treatment option for hybrid arch repair. Zone 1 is related with relevant risk for type Ia endoleak and higher mortality during follow-up. Lifelong surveillance after hybrid repair is essential.",

    "abstract": "The femoropopliteal arteries are subjected to considerable axial and bending deformity due to flexion at the hip and knee joints. The Supera helical interwoven nitinol stent system (IDEV Technologies, Inc/Abbott Laboratories, Inc, Webster, Tex) has good conformability and flexibility, with a very low incidence of mechanical fatigue. This study reviewed our experience with the use of Supera stents for femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions and identified risk factors for restenosis or occlusion.\nPatients with symptomatic femoropopliteal atherosclerotic diseases who underwent lower limb angioplasty and Supera stent insertion were studied. All patients had regular clinical follow-up and underwent a Doppler ultrasound examination at 3\u00a0months and then every 6\u00a0months, and radiography of the stents at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36\u00a0months. Patency rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. We also evaluated the prospectively maintained cohort to identify predictors of restenosis.\nFrom October 2011 to December 2014, 164 legs in 153 symptomatic patients (96 male, 57 female) with femoropopliteal occlusive disease, with mean age of 76.7\u00a0years (range, 46-100\u00a0years), were included. Ninety-five patients (58%) had claudication, nine (5%) had rest pain, and 60 (37%) had tissue loss. Disease distribution was 64 proximal superficial femoral arteries (SFAs; 39%), 107 middle SFAs (65%), 127 distal SFAs (77%), 78 above-knee popliteal arteries (48%), and 19 below-knee popliteal arteries (12%). Lesion classification by TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) A, B, C, and D was 49 (30%), 79 (48%), 31 (19%), 3 (1%), respectively. The mean lesion length was 105.6\u00a0mm (range, 3-400\u00a0mm), and more than one Supera stent was inserted in 26 patients. Procedure success (residual stenosis\u00a0<30%) was achieved in 100% of procedures. The primary patency rates (>50% patency) at 6, 12, 24, and 30\u00a0months were (\u00b1standard error) 86.7%\u00a0\u00b1 3.1%, 81.4%\u00a0\u00b1 3.7%, 79.9%\u00a0\u00b1 4.0%, and 77\u00a0\u00b1 3.0%, respectively. The ankle-brachial pressure index increased from 0.57\u00a0\u00b1 0.15 preoperatively to 0.87\u00a0\u00b1 0.14 postoperatively. No stent fractures occurred. There were three 30-day deaths not related to the procedure or device, one major amputation 3\u00a0months after revascularization, and 29 late deaths (>30\u00a0days) of unrelated medical causes in follow-up. In-stent restenosis was associated with younger patient age and with dyslipidemia, long lesion, and stent length.\nOur midterm experience showed that the implantation of the helical interwoven nitinol stents in patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease is safe and effective, with encouraging patency rates and clinical results.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair has become increasingly popular the last years for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) and thoracic aortic aneurysms. EVAR is less invasive compared with the classic open approach, related to a decreased immediate postoperative morbidity and mortality. Those beneficial characteristics of EVAR do not come without a cost, since EVAR requires that the patient will be exposed to a significant amount of radiation during preoperative planning, graft placement, and consecutive follow-up. This systematic review examines the periprocedural radiation exposure to patients and staff as well as ways to ameliorate it.\nA systematic literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE electronic database. All articles reporting radiation exposure to alive humans during EVAR were eligible for review. Only studies publishing numerical data regarding radiation exposure were included in the Results section. Other relevant articles were used for further discussion.\nTwenty-four studies, both prospective and retrospective in nature, were included. These studies revealed that the radiation exposure depends on the specific type of procedure, with more complex procedures carrying greater radiation burden. Variations in the positioning and operating of the fluoroscopic unit may significantly alter radiation dose to both patients and staff. There was an apparent lack of education among vascular specialists and trainees in terms of radiation safety awareness. At follow-up, a significant number of patients needed additional procedures, and all required radiographic imaging, further increasing the radiation exposure to alarming levels.\nEvery effort should be made to decrease radiation exposure related to endovascular aortic procedures. Attempts must be directed towards maximizing the operator's awareness, welcoming new imaging technology emitting less radiation, and shifting to follow-up strategies that require minimal or no radiation.",

    "abstract": "Screening for common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis with duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity criteria alone can be limited by within-patient and between-patients hemodynamic variability. This study aimed to evaluate inter-CCA velocity ratio criteria to predict high-grade CCA stenosis.\nThis was a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent computed tomography angiography and DUS peak systolic velocity (PSV) measurements of bilateral CCAs, independently recorded, between 2008 and 2014. Patients with dampened CCA waveforms on DUS composed group B. The remainder without dampened waveforms constituted group A. Inter-CCA PSV ratios were calculated by dividing the higher CCA PSV by the lower one of the other side, so the ratios would always be \u22651. Ratios were subsequently paired with each respective unilateral CCA diameter stenosis and differential bilateral CCA diameter stenosis. A quadratic regression model was fitted to predict unilateral and differential stenosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine optimal ratios for \u226550% and \u226580% CCA stenosis. The study excluded patients with carotid artery occlusion.\nFrom a total of 201 patients, 193 patients were included in group A and 8 in group B. Within group A, 31 patients had \u226550% unilateral stenosis and 17 had \u226550% differential stenosis. All stenoses \u226550% were identified on the same side with the higher PSV. Inter-CCA PSV ratio predicted \u226550% unilateral (r(2) = 0.536; P < .001) and differential stenosis (r(2) = 0.581; P < .001). In group B, all patients had \u226560% stenosis that was near or involved the vessel origin. An increasing inter-CCA PSV ratio showed a trend toward contralateral high-grade stenosis (r(2) = 0.596; P = .1). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed an optimal threshold CCA ratio \u22652.16 for \u226550% unilateral stenosis with 92% accuracy, 62% sensitivity, and 98% specificity (area under curve = 0.854; 95% confidence interval, 0.759-0.948) and a ratio \u22652.62 for \u226550% differential stenosis with 97% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, and 98% specificity (area under curve = 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.835-1).\nDUS-based CCA PSV ratio can accurately predict unilateral and differential high-grade CCA stenosis. Also, in patients with unilateral dampened waveforms, it implied contralateral severe proximal stenosis. This parameter should be further validated in prospective studies and may serve as an adjunct screening tool to detect high-grade CCA stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common postoperative complications after vascular reconstruction, producing significant morbidity and hospital readmission. In contrast to SSI that develops while patients are still hospitalized, little is known about the cohort of patients who develop SSI after discharge. In this study, we explore the factors that lead to postdischarge SSI, investigate the differences between risk factors for in-hospital vs postdischarge SSI, and develop a scoring system to identify patients who might benefit from postdischarge monitoring of their wounds.\nPatients who underwent major vascular surgery from 2005 to 2012 for aneurysm and lower extremity occlusive disease were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files. Patients were categorized as having no SSI, in-hospital SSI, or SSI after hospital discharge. Predictors of postdischarge SSI were determined by multivariable logistic regression and internally validated by bootstrap resampling. Risk scores were assigned to all significant variables in the model. Summative risk scores were collapsed into quartile-based ordinal categories and defined as low, low/moderate, moderate/high, and high risk. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of in-hospital SSI.\nOf the 49,817 patients who underwent major vascular surgery, 4449 (8.9%) were diagnosed with SSI (2.1% in-hospital SSI; 6.9% postdischarge SSI). By multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with increased odds of postdischarge SSI include female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, neurologic disease, prolonged operative time >4 hours, American Society of Anesthesiology class 4 or 5, lower extremity revascularization or aortoiliac procedure, and groin anastomosis. The model exhibited moderate discrimination (bias-corrected C statistic, 0.691) and excellent internal calibration. The postdischarge SSI rate was 2.1% for low-risk patients, 5.1% for low/moderate-risk patients, 7.8% for moderate/high-risk patients, and 14% for high-risk patients. In a comparative analysis, comorbidities were the primary driver of postdischarge SSI, whereas in-hospital factors (operative time, emergency case status) and complications predicted in-hospital SSI.\nThe majority of SSIs after major vascular surgery develop following hospital discharge. We have created a scoring system that can select a cohort of patients at high risk for SSI after discharge. These patients can be targeted for transitional care efforts focused on early detection and treatment with the goal of reducing morbidity and preventing readmission secondary to SSI.",

    "abstract": "Junctional component separation producing type IIIa endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an uncommon but serious complication requiring unanticipated reinterventions. This retrospective study analyzed main-body EVAR component uncoupling and type IIIa endoleaks encountered with Powerlink and AFX (Endologix Inc, Irvine, Calif) endografts during an 8-year period.\nType IIIa endoleaks were identified from a database of secondary interventions and clinical surveillance. Operative reports, medical records, and computed tomography studies were reviewed. Clinical and imaging characteristics were analyzed over time, and differences were compared at appropriate follow-up intervals.\nSince 2006, 701 patients underwent primary EVAR using Endologix Powerlink (352 patients, 2006-2011) or AFX (349 patients, 2011-2014) endografts. Endoleaks required 32 secondary interventions (4.6%), including type Ia in 4 patients (1 proximal extension and 3 explants); type Ib in 8 patients (all distal extensions for enlarging iliac aneurysms); type II in 1 patient (explant); type IIIa in 17 patients (2.4%), who were the subject of this report; and type IIIb in 2 patients (both EVAR relining). The 17 patients with type IIIa endoleak were an average age of 71 years, and 14 (82%) were men. The mean preoperative abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter was 70 \u00b1 18 mm. The repair was elective in 16 patients and an emergency in one. Ten cases were performed with Powerlink and seven with AFX. Analysis of serial computed tomography scans found significant changes in AAA diameter; renal-to-bifurcation straight-line, centerline, and greater curvature lengths; EVAR angulation; and loss of EVAR component overlap. The average time from EVAR to reintervention was 32 months. Three patients returned with a ruptured AAA and three with AAA thrombosis, and three of these patients (18%) died \u226430 days of the emergency reintervention. Secondary procedures included EVAR relining with additional bridging components in 14 patients (82%), explant in 2, and axillobifemoral bypass in 1. No new cases of endograft uncoupling have been identified in patients treated with AFX since December 2012 after adoption of revised instructions for use.\nAlthough a small number of secondary interventions were needed after EVAR with the Endologix Powerlink or AFX endografts, most were undertaken for late main-body component uncoupling and type IIIa endoleak, which can occur after sideways displacement of the endograft in large and angulated AAAs. Patients treated before 2013 under the old instructions for use should be evaluated for signs of impending component separation and monitored annually, noting that expected indicators of endograft failure, such as increasing AAA diameter and endoleak, may be absent.",

    "abstract": "Developing patient-centered approaches to health care requires increased engagement of patients in their own care, including treatment decisions. Current levels of patient involvement in treatment choices have not been quantified, however, and whether patients desire greater decision-making responsibility is unknown. We conducted a prospective study to explore patients' desired vs experienced roles in treatment decisions, characterize perceptions of treatment outcomes, and identify important sources of information.\nPatients undergoing elective vascular procedures completed a survey consisting of multiple choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. Statistics are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or count (%). Differences among procedure categories were evaluated using \u03c7(2) or the Fisher exact test at P < .05 based on responses scored 1 to 2, indicating importance, agreement, or satisfaction based on a 1 to 5 Likert scale where 1 = \"very important,\" \"strongly agree\" or \"very satisfied\".\nOf 101 patients who were contacted, 81 participated. Procedure categories included abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in 20, arteriovenous (AV) hemodialysis access in 21, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 20, and intervention for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 20. Participants preferred discussion of all treatments being considered vs only the provider's recommended treatment (90% vs 56%) and choosing together with the provider vs having the provider choose for them (93% vs 62%). Although participants indicated adequate information to ask questions without feeling overwhelmed, only 77% agreed that they had the opportunity to ask questions and only 54% indicated that they were offered a choice. Thirty-seven participants (46%) considered their first treatment was successful, 38% considered a subsequent treatment was successful, and 16% considered none of their treatments were successful. Participants undergoing PAD and AV access procedures most often felt confused or overwhelmed (25% and 24%, respectively, vs 0% for AAA and CEA; P < .01). Patients with PAD had adequate information least often (70% vs 85% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P = .01), had the lowest satisfaction with understanding of their diagnosis (65% vs 95% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P < .01), and most often considered none of their treatments successful (35% vs 0% for AAA, 15% for AV access, and 15% for CEA; P = .02). Providers were identified as the most important information source.\nPatients have variable levels of participation in decision making related to vascular procedures and often consider their treatments unsuccessful. Although providers are important sources of information, patients still prefer to discuss all options being considered and contribute to shared decision making.",

Participants preferred discussion of all treatments being considered vs only the provider's recommended treatment (90% vs 56%) and choosing together with the provider vs having the provider choose for them (93% vs 62%). Although participants indicated adequate information to ask questions without feeling overwhelmed, only 77% agreed that they had the opportunity to ask questions and only 54% indicated that they were offered a choice. Thirty-seven participants (46%) considered their first treatment was successful, 38% considered a subsequent treatment was successful, and 16% considered none of their treatments were successful. Participants undergoing PAD and AV access procedures most often felt confused or overwhelmed (25% and 24%, respectively, vs 0% for AAA and CEA; P < .01). Patients with PAD had adequate information least often (70% vs 85% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P = .01), had the lowest satisfaction with understanding of their diagnosis (65% vs 95% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P < .01), and most often considered none of their treatments successful (35% vs 0% for AAA, 15% for AV access, and 15% for CEA; P = .02).

The primary maturation rate was 88.2% at a mean of 39 \u00b1 24.1 days after the operation. By multiple logistic regression analysis, minimum cephalic vein (CV) diameter >2 mm was an independent predictor of RCAVF maturation (odds ratio, 3.672; 95% confidence interval, 1.394-9.673; P = .008), which was more easily achieved in nondiabetic patients. During the mean follow-up of 47.2 \u00b1 23.1 months, primary patency of RCAVFs was 80.3% at 1 year and 76.5% at 2 years. A Cox proportional hazard model showed diabetes was the only independent risk factor of primary patency (hazard ratio, 2.008; 95% confidence interval, 1.022-3.945; P = .043). Nondiabetic patients with a CV diameter >2 mm had significantly higher primary maturation rate and higher primary patency than diabetic patients with a CV diameter \u22642 mm.\nThere were different risk factors affecting RCAVF primary maturation and primary patency. A CV with a small-diameter of \u22642 mm combined with diabetes was an independent risk factor of failure not only of primary maturation but also of primary patency in RCAVF.",

    "abstract": "Successful arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation is often challenging in obese patients. Optimal initial intraoperative blood flow (IOBF) is essential for adequate AVF maturation. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of obesity on IOBF and radiocephalic AVF maturation.\nPatients with a newly created radiocephalic AVF were included (N = 252). Obesity was defined as a baseline body mass index (BMI) \u226525 kg/m(2), and primary maturation failure was defined as failure to use the AVF successfully by 3 months after its creation. IOBF was measured immediately after construction of the AVF with a VeriQ system (MediStim, Oslo, Norway).\nThe mean BMI was 24.1 \u00b1 3.9 kg/m(2), and the prevalence of obesity was 31.3%. Particularly, 8.3% (21 patients) had a BMI \u226530 kg/m(2). Primary maturation failure occurred in 100 patients (39.7%), and an IOBF <190 mL/min was closely associated with the risk of maturation failure (relative risk, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-6.11). Compared with nonobese patients, obese subjects had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, whereas diameters of vessels were similar. When the patients were further divided into three groups as BMI <25, 25 to 29.9, and \u226530 kg/m(2), patients in the higher BMI group showed significantly lower IOBF and higher maturation failure rate. According to multivariate analysis, the statistically significant variables that determined maturation failure were obesity, previous vascular disease, increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, and IOBF <190 mL/min.\nObese patients had a significantly lower IOBF, and both obesity and low IOBF contributed to the primary maturation failure of AVF. Obesity-associated inflammation and atherosclerosis might play roles in this association.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy is the most effective treatment for reducing the risk of stroke in patients with significant carotid stenosis. Few studies have focused on the failure rate of regional anesthesia.\nData of all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (June 2009 to December 2014) in a single center were collected. Combined deep and superficial cervical plexus block or superficial plexus block alone was used according to the attending anesthesiologist's choice and the patient's characteristics (eg, dual antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy). Intraoperative remifentanil (0.025-0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min) was administered to maintain an adequate level of comfort, responsiveness, and cooperation. General anesthesia was planned only in the case of major contraindications or the patient's refusal of locoregional anesthesia. The primary end point of our study was the incidence of intraoperative conversion from locoregional to general anesthesia.\nA total of 2463 carotid endarterectomies were included in the analysis. Regional anesthesia was initially chosen in 2439 patients, whereas 24 patients received planned general anesthesia. In seven cases, regional anesthesia was converted to general anesthesia because of severe agitation of the patient (before clamping in four cases, after carotid clamping in two cases, and after declamping in one case). A shunt was used in 302 patients (12.3%) because of neurologic deterioration at the carotid clamping test. Intraoperative complications were emergent repeated surgical procedures in 13 cases (0.53%) because of acute neurologic deterioration, 1 intraoperative acute myocardial infarction (0.04%), and 3 cases (0.04%) of hemodynamically relevant supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. No intraoperative death occurred. In-hospital mortality was 0.12% (three patients). Major stroke occurred in 23 patients (0.93%); minor stroke occurred in 16 patients (0.65%). The combined stroke and death rate was 1.62% (40 patients).\nIn our practice, carotid endarterectomy under regional anesthesia is safe and associated with a very low rate of conversion to general anesthesia.",

Regional anesthesia was initially chosen in 2439 patients, whereas 24 patients received planned general anesthesia. In seven cases, regional anesthesia was converted to general anesthesia because of severe agitation of the patient (before clamping in four cases, after carotid clamping in two cases, and after declamping in one case). A shunt was used in 302 patients (12.3%) because of neurologic deterioration at the carotid clamping test. Intraoperative complications were emergent repeated surgical procedures in 13 cases (0.53%) because of acute neurologic deterioration, 1 intraoperative acute myocardial infarction (0.04%), and 3 cases (0.04%) of hemodynamically relevant supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. No intraoperative death occurred. In-hospital mortality was 0.12% (three patients). Major stroke occurred in 23 patients (0.93%); minor stroke occurred in 16 patients (0.65%). The combined stroke and death rate was 1.62% (40 patients).",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI), the most advanced form of peripheral arterial disease, is associated with strikingly high morbidity and mortality rates. Autogenous single-segment great saphenous vein (GSV) remains the optimal conduit for infrainguinal revascularization. Unfortunately, GSV is unavailable in up to 20% of patients. There is no consensus about the alternative graft that should be used for infragenicular bypass grafting when the GSV is unavailable. Currently, there are no outcome data for cold-stored venous allograft use in regard to recent safety and efficacy objective performance goals described by the Society for Vascular Surgery.\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 118 infragenicular revascularizations performed for CLI with cold-stored venous allografts obtained from varicose vein stripping surgery in a single institution from November 2002 to August 2013.\nMean age (\u00b1 standard deviation) was 75 \u00b1 12 years (male, 76%; diabetes, 73%; dialysis, 16%), and 38% (n = 45) had a history of failed ipsilateral revascularization. None had suitable autogenous conduit for even composite vein bypass. The distal anastomosis was performed to an infrapopliteal artery in 85 cases (72%). At 30 days, perioperative death rate was 6.8%, major adverse cardiovascular event rate was 7.6%, and major adverse limb event rate was 11.9%. Mean follow-up was 34 \u00b1 29 months (range, 1-113 months). At 1 year, freedom from major adverse limb event or perioperative death, limb salvage, survival, amputation-free survival, and secondary patency rates were, respectively, 64.9%, 82.5%, 85.4%, 73.3%, and 58.3%. Ejection fraction <45% and dialysis were the most significant factors predicting failure of revascularization.\nCold-stored venous allografts may be used for performing infragenicular revascularization for CLI with acceptable safety and efficacy results despite poor long-term patency. Their level of performance remains inferior to autologous vein sources but seems comparable to alternative allografts or prosthetic conduit. Their availability is a major advantage compared with other biologic alternative sources.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests high prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) among patients with coronary disease. Accurate characterization of the association between coronary disease and AAA and of the actual prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified coronary artery disease (CAD) is needed to evaluate the possible benefits of systematic screening for AAA.\nWe searched for studies that reported the association between AAA and CAD or coronary heart disease (CHD; wider phenotype definition) in the general population (randomized controlled trials, prospective population cohorts) and those that reported the prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified CAD through PubMed, Embase, and reference lists for the period between 1980 and 2014. Random-effects models were applied because of the high heterogeneity between included studies.\nAmong the general population, 23 studies reported the association between CHD and the occurrence of subclinical AAA (positive ultrasound screening; meta-analyzed odds ratio of 2.38 with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.78-3.19; P = 4.1 \u00d7 10(-9)). According to four prospective studies, CHD is a strong predictor of future AAA events (fatal and nonfatal; meta-analyzed hazard ratio of 3.49 with 95% CI of 2.56-4.76; P = 2.4 \u00d7 10(-15)). Altogether, 10 studies reported the prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified CAD or undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Among men, meta-analyzed prevalence was 9.5% (95% CI, 7.6%-11.7%). Among men undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or with three-vessel disease, the prevalence was 11.4% (95% CI, 9.1%-13.9%). Among women, the prevalence was low (0.35%).\nThe risk of subclinical AAA and future AAA events is high among patients with coronary disease. Screening for AAA among CAD patients by cardiologists would be easy and inexpensive, with possible benefits to survival and risk evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Routine initiation \u03b2-blocker medications before vascular surgery is controversial due to conflicting data. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether prophylactic use of \u03b2-blockers before major elective vascular surgery decreased postoperative cardiac events or mortality.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (SVS-VQI) data set was used to perform a retrospective cohort analysis of infrainguinal lower extremity bypass (LEB), aortofemoral bypass (AFB), and open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair patients. Chronic (>30 days preoperatively) \u03b2-blocker patients were excluded, and comparisons were made between preoperative (0-30 day) and no \u03b2-blocker groups. Patients were risk stratified using a novel prediction tool derived specifically from the SVS-VQI data set. Propensity-matched pairs and interprocedural specific risk stratification comparisons were performed. End points included in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including myocardial infarction (MI; defined as new ST or T wave electrocardiographic changes, troponin elevation, or documentation by echocardiogram or other imaging modality), dysrhythmia, and congestive heart failure, and 30-day mortality.\nThe study analyzed 13,291 patients (LEB, 68% [n = 9047]; AFB, 11% [n = 1474]; and open AAA, 21% [n = 2770]); of these, 67.7% (n = 8999) were receiving \u03b2-blockers at time of their index procedure. Specifically, 13.2% (n = 1753) were identified to have been started on a preoperative \u03b2-blocker, 54.5% (n = 7426) were on chronic \u03b2-blockers, and 32.3% (n = 4286) were on no preoperative \u03b2-blockers. Among the three procedures, patients had significant demographic and comorbidity differences and thus were not combined. A 1:1 propensity-matched pairs analysis (1459 pairs) revealed higher rates of postoperative MI with preoperative \u03b2-blockers (preoperative \u03b2-blocker relative risk, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.68; P = .05 vs no \u03b2-blocker), with no difference in dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or 30-day mortality. When stratified into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups within each procedure, all groups of preoperative \u03b2-blocker patients had no difference or higher rates of MACEs and 30-day mortality, with the exception of high-risk open AAA patients, who had a lower rate of MI (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 011-0.87; P = .04).\nExclusive of high-risk open AAA patients, preoperative \u03b2-blockers did not decrease rates of MACEs or mortality after LEB, AFB, or open AAA. Importantly, exposure to prophylactic preoperative \u03b2-blockers increased the rates of some adverse events in several subgroups. Given these data, the SVS-VQI cannot support routine initiation of preoperative \u03b2-blockers before major elective vascular surgery in most patients.",

Among the three procedures, patients had significant demographic and comorbidity differences and thus were not combined. A 1:1 propensity-matched pairs analysis (1459 pairs) revealed higher rates of postoperative MI with preoperative \u03b2-blockers (preoperative \u03b2-blocker relative risk, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.68; P = .05 vs no \u03b2-blocker), with no difference in dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or 30-day mortality. When stratified into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups within each procedure, all groups of preoperative \u03b2-blocker patients had no difference or higher rates of MACEs and 30-day mortality, with the exception of high-risk open AAA patients, who had a lower rate of MI (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 011-0.87; P = .04).",

    "abstract": "Limb-sparing procedures are currently considered the standard treatment for lower limb soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Surgical excision combined with vascular resection may be necessary to provide an adequate safety margin and to improve the oncologic outcomes. In this scenario, vascular reconstruction is required to preserve limb function. We evaluated the long-term patency and survival outcomes of arterial and venous reconstruction after resecting lower limb STS in the largest single-center case series to date.\nBetween November 1995 and July 2014, 25 patients with lower limb STS and vascular invasion underwent surgical resection followed by arterial or venous reconstruction. Patients were followed up at regular outpatient visits, at which clinical examinations and duplex ultrasound mapping were performed to assess graft patency.\nA total of 44 revascularization procedures were performed. The median follow-up time for the arterial and venous groups combined was 25.2 months (range, 0.26-225.6 months). The 5-year survival probability was 42.1%. The graft occlusion rate was significantly higher after reconstruction with synthetic grafts than after reconstruction with saphenous vein substitutes (P = .02). The occlusion rate was not significantly different between arterial reconstruction and venous reconstruction (P > .05).\nArterial and venous reconstruction is feasible after surgical resection of lower limb STS. Vascular reconstruction provides favorable long-term patency outcomes and low complication rates, allowing limb preservation and disease control in a select group of patients. Vascular reconstruction using venous grafts had a significantly higher patency rate than reconstruction with artificial venous substitutes.",

    "abstract": "Open surgery has given way to endovascular grafting in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. The growing use of endovascular grafts means that fewer patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease have open surgery. The declining open surgery caseload challenges the surgeon's operative skills, particularly because open surgery is increasingly used in those patients who are unsuitable for endovascular repair and hence technically more demanding. We assessed the early outcome after aortic bifurcated bypass procedures during two decades of growing endovascular activity and identified preoperative risk factors.\nData on patients with chronic limb ischemia were prospectively collected during a 20-year period (1993 to 2012). The data were obtained from the Danish Vascular Registry, assessed, and merged with data from The Danish Civil Registration System.\nWe identified 3623 aortobifemoral and 144 aortobiiliac bypass procedures. The annual caseload fell from 323 to 106 during the study period, but the 30-day mortality at 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-4.1) and the 30-day major complication rate remained constant at 20% (95% CI, 18-21). Gangrene (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% CI, 1.7-6.5; P = .005) was the most significant risk factor for 30-day mortality, followed by renal insufficiency (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8; P = .035) and cardiac disease (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-3.1; P < .001). Multiorgan failure, mesenteric ischemia, need for dialysis, and cardiac complications were the most lethal complications, with mortality rates of 94%, 44%, 38%, and 34%, respectively.\nAortic bifurcated bypass is a high-risk procedure. Although open surgery has increasingly given way to endovascular repair, 30-day outcomes have remained stable during the past decade. Thus, it is still acceptable to consider an aortic bifurcated bypass whenever endovascular management is not feasible.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to introduce a novel strategy for thoracic endovascular aortic repair of Stanford B aortic dissection using two-stent graft implantation (TSI), in which the proximal stent and distal stent with different sizes are sequentially deployed, and to summarize our experience with this technique.\nA retrospective study was conducted of 72 consecutive patients (61 men; mean age, 55 \u00b1 7 years; range, 41-67 years) with Stanford type B aortic dissection who underwent TSI treatment between January 2012 and May 2013. Among all patients, 43 (59.7%) involved the infrarenal aorta and 29 (40.3%) involved the whole thoracic and abdominal aorta; mean aortic involvement length was 226 \u00b1 13 mm (range, 182-312 mm). Eight cases were for acute dissection (within 2 weeks from onset of symptoms), 11 cases were for chronic dissection (>3 months after initial dissection), and 53 cases were for subacute dissection (between 2 weeks and 3 months). Twenty-two cases (30.6%) were uncomplicated type and 50 cases (69.4%) were complicated type. Follow-up was performed postoperatively at 1 month, 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Technique success, aorta morphology, and procedure-related complications were evaluated.\nTechnical success was achieved in 100%; 72 pairs of stent grafts (144 thoracic stent grafts) and 10 left subclavian artery chimney stents were used. The mean aortic length coverage by the stent grafts was 197.6 \u00b1 20.3 mm, and mean taper diameter span was 7.5 \u00b1 1.8 mm. All patients were followed up from 6 to 16 months (mean, 10 \u00b1 4 months); 95.8% (69 of 72) had a thrombosed false lumen in the aortic coverage, and the true lumen expanded on average 57% \u00b1 11% (23%-100%). No significant changes were found in aortic diameters of the proximal and distal ends of the two stent grafts and the angles between centerlines of the distal end of the stent and the aorta during follow-up. Procedure-related complications included transient paraplegia (coverage of the left subclavian artery without revascularization and extensive coverage of aorta >220 mm) due to acute spinal cord ischemia (n = 1) and malapposition of the distal stent (primary tear closed, true lumen expansion led to oversize rate insufficient in distal stent diameter; n = 1). No death or malperfusion complications were observed during the perioperative period and follow-up.\nShort-term outcomes showed TSI to be a flexible and effective approach to accurately repair Stanford B aortic dissection that could potentially address the limitations of currently available stent grafts. Further prospective clinical studies are warranted to evaluate its long-term efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Locoregional anesthesia is an effective method for evaluating cerebral function during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Landmark-guided regional anesthesia (RA) is currently used for CEA and can provoke substantial perioperative hypertension. Ultrasound-guided RA (US-RA) is a new method for performing RA in CEA; however, the effect on sympathetic activity and blood pressure is uncertain. This study assessed early sympathetic activity during CEA in US-RA compared with general anesthesia (GA).\nPatients were prospectively randomized to receive US-RA (n = 32) or GA (n = 28) for CEA. The primary end point was the change in systolic arterial blood pressure after induction of anesthesia (just before starting surgery) comparing US-RA with GA. We also recorded heart rate and analyzed concentrations of plasma blood hormones, including cortisol, metanephrine, and normetanephrine at five different times. Creatinine kinase, troponin I, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were analyzed to detect potential changes in cardiac biomarkers during the procedure.\nSystolic arterial blood pressure (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) increased significantly in US-RA patients compared with GA patients even before surgery was initiated (180 \u00b1 26 mm Hg vs 109 \u00b1 24 mm Hg; P < .001), then remained elevated during the entire surgery and returned to baseline values 1 hour after admission to the postoperative anesthesia care unit. Heart rate (US-RA: 78 \u00b1 16 beats/min, GA: 52 \u00b1 12 beats/min; P < .001) and cortisol levels (US-RA: 155 \u00b1 97 \u03bcg/L, GA: 99 \u00b1 43 \u03bcg/L; P = .006) were also significantly higher in the US-RA group after induction of anesthesia. Other values did not differ.\nThe US-RA technique for CEA induces temporary intraoperative hypertension and an increase in stress hormone levels. Nevertheless, US-RA is a feasible, effective, and safe form of locoregional for CEA that enables targeted placement of low volumes of local anesthesia under direct visualization.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the outcomes of single-stent vs kissing-stents techniques in asymmetric complex aortoiliac bifurcation (ACAB) lesions.\nWe retrospectively investigated 80 consecutive patients (69 males, 66.6 \u00b1 8.7 years) treated with a single stent and 30 patients (26 males, 67.1 \u00b1 7.7 years) treated with kissing stents for ACAB between January 2005 and December 2012 from a single-center cohort. A ACAB lesion was defined as a symptomatic unilateral common iliac artery stenosis (>50%) combined with intermediate stenosis (30%-50%) in the contralateral common iliac artery ostium. The primary end point was the primary patency of the ACAB.\nThe baseline clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between the single-stent and the kissing-stents group. Technical success was achieved in all patients. The single-stent group required fewer stents (1.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs 2.3 \u00b1 0.8; P < .001) and less bilateral femoral access (55% vs 100%; P < .001). Two patients in the single-stent group (3%) required bailout kissing stents because of plaque shift to the contralateral side. The major complication rates were 8% in single-stent vs 13% in the kissing-stent group, which was similar (P = .399). At 3 years, the single-stent and kissing-stents group had similar rates of primary patency (89% vs 87%; P = .916) and target lesion revascularization-free survival (93% vs 87%; P = .462).\nThe single-stent technique in ACAB was safe and showed midterm outcomes comparable with those of kissing stents. Considering the benefits, such as fewer stents, less bilateral femoral access, and the availability of contralateral access for future intervention, the single-stent technique may be an advantageous treatment option in ACAB.",

    "abstract": "Many believe extremes of age correlate with poorer outcomes in treatment for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We hypothesized that the youngest patients would have significantly poorer outcomes compared with older cohorts due to the precocious nature of their PAD.\nWe studied all patients in the Vascular Study Group of New England database undergoing infrainguinal bypass for PAD between 2003 and 2013. Age was grouped by <50 years, 50 to 79 years, and \u226580 years. Our primary outcomes were 1-year freedom from a major adverse limb event (MALE), defined as ipsilateral amputation or need for secondary intervention, and amputation-free survival. A second analysis was performed to analyze the subgroup of patients aged <50 years with critical limb ischemia (CLI), which included a Cox regression model to determine risk factors for MALE or death at 1 year.\nOf 5265 patients who were treated with infrainguinal bypass for PAD, 324 (6.2%) were aged <50 years. The mean age was 44.6 years, and 66.4% were male. The proportion of African Americans was significantly higher in the youngest age group (<50 years: 6.8% vs 50-79 years: 3.5%, P = .002; vs \u226580 years: 3.5%, P = .013). More bypasses were done for claudication than acute limb ischemia in patients aged <50 years (33.3% vs 11.4%). More vein grafts were used vs prosthetic (<50 years: 72.1% vs 50-79 years: 65.9%, P = .024; vs \u226580 years: 62.6%, P = .002). Fewer concomitant proximal procedures were performed compared with the older groups (<50 years: 37.7% vs 50-79 years: 51.1%, P < .001; vs \u226580 years: 39.5%, P = .045). More young patients returned to the operating room within their initial hospitalization for early graft thrombosis (<50 years: 5.6% vs 50-79 years: 2.9%, P = .001; vs \u226580 years: 2.4%, P = .009) and revision (<50 years: 4.7% vs 50-79 years: 2.2%, P = .012; vs \u226580 years: 1.4%, P = .002) compared with the older patients. Overall, MALE-free survival was similar across age groups (P = .323), as were patency and amputation rates. When considering only patients with CLI, MALE-free survival in the youngest patients was again similar (P = .171) but with significantly more major amputations at 1 year (P = .022).\nFor patients aged <50 undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery, this large series demonstrates similar overall medium-term graft-related outcomes compared with older cohorts. Further, although the youngest patients with CLI have similar MALEs, their amputation rates are higher than in older cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) carries a high mortality rate, even with prompt transfer to a medical center. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that improves predictive ability through pattern recognition while continually adapting to new input data. The goal of this study was to effectively use ANN modeling to provide vascular surgeons a discriminant adjunct to assess the likelihood of in-hospital mortality on a pending rAAA admission using easily obtainable patient information from the field.\nOf 332 total patients from a single institution from 1998 to 2013 who had attempted rAAA repair, 125 were reviewed for preoperative factors associated with in-hospital mortality; 108 patients received an open operation, and 17 patients received endovascular repair. Five variables were found significant on multivariate analysis (P < .05), and four of these five (preoperative shock, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and age) were modeled by multiple logistic regression and an ANN. These predictive models were compared against the Glasgow Aneurysm Score. All models were assessed by generation of receiver operating characteristic curves and actual vs predicted outcomes plots, with area under the curve and Pearson r(2) value as the primary measures of discriminant ability.\nOf the 125 patients, 53 (42%) did not survive to discharge. Five preoperative factors were significant (P < .05) independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis: advanced age, renal disease, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and shock, although renal disease was excluded from the models. The sequential accumulation of zero to four of these risk factors progressively increased overall mortality rate, from 11% to 16% to 44% to 76% to 89% (age \u2265 70 years considered a risk factor). Algorithms derived from multiple logistic regression, ANN, and Glasgow Aneurysm Score models generated area under the curve values of 0.85 \u00b1 0.04, 0.88 \u00b1 0.04 (training set), and 0.77 \u00b1 0.06 and Pearson r(2) values of .36, .52 and .17, respectively. The ANN model represented the most discriminant of the three.\nAn ANN-based predictive model may represent a simple, useful, and highly discriminant adjunct to the vascular surgeon in accurately identifying those patients who may carry a high mortality risk from attempted repair of rAAA, using only easily definable preoperative variables. Although still requiring external validation, our model is available for demonstration at https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=NN97NM7DTK.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated endoleak level and size decrease of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with coil embolization in patients at high risk for type II endoleak.\nBetween 2009 and 2013, 83 of 187 patients (44.3%) who underwent EVAR for AAA also underwent coil embolization of the aneurysm sac immediately after complete stent graft release because of risk factors for type II endoleak, including absence of a circumferential thrombus, two or more pairs of patent lumbar arteries, or a patent inferior mesenteric artery. Coil embolization was achieved using a 4F catheter with a microcatheter placed between the stent graft and the aneurysm wall. Computed tomography and color duplex ultrasound imaging were performed 1, 6, 12, and 24 months later to look for an endoleak and assess aneurysm sac diameter.\nMean follow-up was 24 \u00b1 11 months (range, 6-53 months). A mean of 12 coils (range, 4-23) was used. Technical success was achieved in all patients, with no procedurally related complications. Follow-up computed tomography showed type II endoleak in one patient. Aneurysm sac diameter was significantly decreased after 6 months (P = .001), 12 months (P = .001), and 24 months (P = .001). Surgery was required in one patient for common femoral artery occlusion unrelated to the procedure and in another patient for distal type I endoleak.\nAneurysm sac coil embolization during EVAR for patients at risk for type II endoleak is technically feasible, safe, and effective in preventing type II endoleak. This procedure leads to rapid AAA shrinkage. Thus, coil embolization could be used routinely to improve EVAR outcomes for patients at risk for type II endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Coverage of celiac artery (CA) during thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) has been performed to extend the distal seal zone for which preliminary results and short-term follow-up have been reported. We aim to show the outcomes up to 81 months after CA coverage during TEVAR.\nPatients undergoing TEVAR with coverage of the CA origin from 2005 to 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Points of analysis include indications for covering the CA, demonstration of collateral circulation between the CA and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), anatomic features of the distal landing zone, rate of reintervention, technical success, presence of clinical ischemic symptoms after the procedure, and mortality.\nDuring the 9-year period, 366 patients underwent TEVAR, 18 (5%) of whom had CA coverage. Eleven (61%) had TEVAR with CA coverage due to a thoracic aneurysm, three (17%) had thoracic aortic dissection related to aneurysm, and four (22%) had previous TEVAR with a type Ib endoleak (EL) requiring distal coverage. Mesenteric angiography in preparation for TEVAR with CA coverage diagnosed a critical SMA stenosis in one patient that was treated with stenting before the index procedure. At the conclusion of the indicated procedure, two patients (11%) had a type Ia EL and two patients (11%) had a type Ib EL. Three of the type I ELs required reintervention. Two patients (11%) had a type II EL, both of which were managed with observation and resolved. Reintervention was required in 27% of patients. Postoperative complications included visceral ischemia in 2 (11%), weight loss in 1 (5%), spinal cord ischemia in 2 (11%), a cerebrovascular event in 1 (6%), and death in 1 (6%). The mean follow-up period was 38 months (range, 0.5-81 months).\nThis analysis of outcomes up to 81 months supports the suitability of covering the CA in selected patients for extending the distal landing zone to the visceral aortic level above the SMA or when alternative branch vessel treatment is unavailable. Preoperative angiographic evaluation of the mesenteric collaterals and early postoperative surveillance may limit postoperative complications. Once the CA is covered, new symptoms do not develop unless the SMA is compromised.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons may aid in primarily nonvascular procedures. Such activity has not been quantified, and hospital administrators may be unaware of the importance of vascular surgeons to support other hospital-based surgical programs. This study reviewed intraoperative consultations by vascular surgeons to support other surgical services.\nIntraoperative vascular consultations were reviewed from January 2006 to January 2014 for consulting service, indication, and whether consultation occurred with advanced notice. Patient demographics, operative times, estimated blood loss, length of stay, and relative value units (RVUs) assigned for each consultation were also assessed. Consultations for trauma and iatrogenic injuries occurring outside the operating theater were excluded.\nVascular surgeons performed 225 intraoperative consultations in support of procedures by nonvascular surgeons. Requesting services were surgical oncology (46%), orthopedics (17%), urology (11%), otolaryngology (7%), and others (19%). Reasons for consultation overlapped and included vascular reconstruction (53%), control of hemorrhage (39%), and assistance with difficult dissections (43%). Seventy-four percent were for intra-abdominal procedures, and venous (53%) and arterial (50%) problems were encountered equally with some overlap. Most patients were male (59%), overweight (56%; body mass index \u226525 kg/m(2)), had previous surgery (72%) and were undergoing elective procedures (89%). Mean total procedural anesthesia time was 9.4 hours, mean procedural operating time was 7.9 hours, and mean total and vascular-related estimated blood loss was 1702 mL and 327 mL, respectively. Mean length of stay was 14.7 days, mean intensive care unit stay was 2.9 days, and 30-day mortality was 6.2%. Mean nonvascular RVUs per operation were 46.0, and mean vascular RVUs per operation were 30.9.\nUnexpected intraoperative need for vascular surgical expertise occurs often enough that vascular surgeons should be regarded as an essential operating room resource to the general operating room, nonvascular surgeons, and their patients. Intraoperative vascular surgical consultation in support of other surgeons requires a high level of open technical operative skills and is time and labor intensive.",

    "abstract": "Although placement of an open iliac conduit for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is generally felt to result in higher morbidity and mortality, published literature is scarce. Our objective was to assess 30-day outcomes after elective EVAR with an open iliac conduit using a multi-institutional database.\nPatients who underwent elective EVAR (n = 14,339) for abdominal aortic aneurysm were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2005 to 2011 database. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.\nAn open iliac conduit was used in 231 patients (1.6%), and the remainder had femoral exposure or percutaneous EVAR. Women comprised 32% of patients with iliac conduits in contrast to 17% of those without iliac conduits. Patients with iliac conduits were older and had a lower body mass index. Univariable analysis showed patients with open iliac conduits had a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia (3.0% vs 1.1%), ventilator dependence (4.8% vs 1.0%), renal failure (3.0% vs 0.7%), cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction (5.2% vs 1.1%), return to the operating room (9.1% vs 3.7%), major morbidity (16.0 vs 6.6%), and death (3.0% vs 0.9%). On multivariable analysis, the use of open iliac conduits was associated with higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.0) and 30-day major morbidity (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.3).\nPatients with open iliac conduits for EVAR are more likely to be female and have higher postoperative morbidity and mortality. For patients with complex iliac artery disease, conduits are a viable alternative after EVAR to be performed, albeit at an increased risk. These data do suggest the need for lower-profile grafts and other alternative strategies for navigating complex iliac artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Although imaging surveillance is mandatory for all patients after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), many patients are not compliant with follow-up. We sought to determine predictors of compliance with EVAR surveillance and to examine how compliance with current surveillance protocols correlates with survival.\nWe analyzed 188 patients who underwent EVAR at our institution for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) between 2001 and 2011. The primary end point was compliance with post-EVAR surveillance recommendations. Univariate analysis included patient demographics and socioeconomic information, AAA characteristics, EVAR hospital course variables, late complications and secondary interventions, length of follow-up, smoking status, family history of AAA, driving distances, primary care providers, and medical comorbidities. Mortality was determined by the Social Security Death Index. Multinomial logistic regressions were fit to identify independent predictors of compliance. Survival plots were generated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine effect of compliance on survival after adjusting for confounders.\nOf 188 patients, 89 (47.3%) were 100% compliant with follow-up visits and imaging, 21 (11.1%) were moderately compliant by missing appointments, and 78 (41.4%) were lost to follow-up completely. Overall median age was 74 years, and 81.9% of patients were male. Late complications occurred in 77 patients (40.9%), secondary interventions were performed in 32 patients (17%), and 5-year mortality was 21.2%. Mean follow-up interval was >40 months for 100% compliant and moderately compliant patients and <20 months for those lost to follow-up (P < .0001). In adjusted analysis, late complications (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-5.55; P = .007), absence of social work consultation (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.12-5.27; P = .024), and family history of AAA (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.06-6.75; P = .037) were associated with 100% compliance, whereas shorter driving distances (P = .051) and shorter hospital stay (P = .056) approached significance. Transient ischemic attack or stroke (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.18-10.91; P = .024) was the only variable independently associated with moderate compliance. Compared with patients lost to follow-up, 100% compliant patients had worse survival (log-rank test, P = .033), whereas moderately compliant patients' survival was not significantly different (log-rank test, P = .149). In adjusted Cox regression analysis, 100% compliant patients had decreased survival duration (rate ratio, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.18-6.06; P = .018) compared with those lost to follow-up.\nFollow-up surveillance is incomplete for more than half of patients who undergo EVAR at our institution, and patient compliance can be predicted by covariates mentioned before. Compliance with current surveillance regimens does not confer a survival benefit. Further research individualizing surveillance protocols based on risk level of late complications and noncompliance and prospective studies examining resulting survival benefits of compliance are warranted.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine long-term predictors of target lesion reintervention (TLR) after subclavian artery stenting (SAS).\nThis was a single-center retrospective review of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic subclavian artery disease who underwent SAS between January 1999 and December 2013. Repeat intervention was only performed in patients with recurrent symptoms and \u226570% in-stent restenosis (ISR). TLR was defined as need for a repeat percutaneous intervention involving a previously stented area. Freedom from events (ISR and TLR) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the significant predictors of TLR and ISR.\nIndex procedures were performed on 139 arteries in 138 patients (69.6% female). Patients were an average age of 64.5 years, with major comorbidities of hypertension (80.4%), hyperlipidemia (72.5%), and tobacco use (60.1%). Also performed during the study period were 24 TLR procedures, resulting 166 SAS interventions attempted for patients with subclavian atherosclerotic disease during a 15-year span. Of 166 procedures, 163 (98.2%) were treated successfully. Stents were placed in all but two index arteries. The main indications for SAS were subclavian steal syndrome (48.9%), arm claudication (21.6%), and coronary steal syndrome (28.8%). The average preprocedure stenosis was 87.2% \u00b1 11.2%. For index procedures (139 arteries), duplex follow-up was available for 134 arteries (96.4%), with an overall ISR rate of 18.7% (25 of 134). Primary patency for the index procedures was 84.7% at 10 years. The overall TLR rate for the index procedures was 12.7% (17 cases). Seven patients required more than one secondary procedure. For all cases, the freedom from ISR was 91%, 77%, and 68% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, and freedom from TLR was 94%, 85%, and 82% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed the significant predictors of ISR were smoking/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; P = .001), age by decade (HR, 0.5; P < .001), discharged with statin therapy (HR, 0.3; P = .001), vessel diameter \u22647 mm (HR, 2.3; P = .028), and right-sided intervention (HR, 0.3; P = .040). The sole significant predictor of TLR was age by decade (HR, 0.6; P = .008).\nSAS has a high primary success and durability with satisfactory outcomes well beyond 10 years. ISR was more likely to develop in patients who were smokers with chronic obstructive disease or had a baseline vessel size of \u22647 mm. Younger age could be an independent risk factor for secondary intervention.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine whether there is additive benefit of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and clopidogrel compared with ASA monotherapy among patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.\nThis was an observational cohort analysis that included 629 patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia. The prevalence of patients taking ASA monotherapy vs DAPT was assessed monthly for up to 3 years. A propensity model was constructed to adjust for baseline demographic characteristics and to assess the effect of DAPT on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and major adverse limb events.\nAt baseline, 348 patients were taking DAPT and 281 were taking ASA monotherapy. During 3 years of follow-up, 50 events (20%) occurred in the DAPT group vs 59 (29%) in the ASA monotherapy group. After propensity weighting, DAPT use was associated with a decreased risk of MACEs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.96) and overall mortality (adjusted HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.89). No association was found between DAPT use and the risk of major amputation (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.37-1.29). In a subgroup of 94 patients who underwent point-of-care platelet function testing, 21% had decreased response to ASA and 55% had a decreased response to clopidogrel. No association was found between a reduced response to ASA or clopidogrel and adverse events at 1 year.\nDAPT may be associated with reduced rates of MACEs and death among patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies suggest that percutaneous access for endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (pEVAR) offers significant operative and postoperative benefits compared with femoral cutdown (cEVAR). National data on this topic, however, are limited. We compared patient selection and outcomes for elective pEVAR and cEVAR.\nWe identified all patients undergoing either pEVAR (bilateral percutaneous access, whether successful or not) or cEVAR (at least one planned groin cutdown) for abdominal aortic aneurysms from January 2011 to December 2013 in the Targeted Vascular data set from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Emergent cases, ruptures, cases with an iliac conduit, and cases with a preoperative wound infection were excluded. Groups were compared by \u03c7(2) test or t-test or the Mann-Whitney test where appropriate.\nWe identified 4112 patients undergoing elective EVAR, 3004 cEVAR patients (73%) and 1108 pEVAR patients (27%). Of all EVAR patients, 26% had bilateral percutaneous access; 1.0% had attempted percutaneous access converted to cutdown (4% of pEVARs); and the remainder had a planned cutdown, 63.9% bilateral and 9.1% unilateral. There were no significant differences in age, gender, aneurysm diameter, or prior open abdominal surgery. Patients undergoing cEVAR were less likely to have congestive heart failure (1.5% vs 2.4%; P = .04) but more likely to undergo any concomitant procedure during surgery (32% vs 26%; P < .01) than patients undergoing pEVAR. Postoperatively, pEVAR patients had shorter operative time (mean, 135 vs 152 minutes; P < .01), shorter length of stay (median, 1 day vs 2 days; P < .01), and fewer wound complications (2.1% vs 1.0%; P = .02). On multivariable analysis, the only predictor of percutaneous access failure was performance of any concomitant procedure (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.0; P = .04).\nCurrently, one in four patients treated at Targeted Vascular National Surgical Quality Improvement Program centers are getting pEVAR, which is associated with a high success rate, shorter operation time, shorter length of stay, and fewer wound complications compared with cEVAR.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis access-induced distal ischemia (HAIDI) can be classified as acute (on the first postoperative day), subacute (\u22641 month), or chronic (>1 month), based on the time of onset after access creation. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. However, performing additional tests is beneficial in further assessment of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of finger pressure and oxygen saturation measurements for the diagnosis of chronic HAIDI.\nA total of 20 patients with chronic HAIDI (cases) and 40 asymptomatic hemodialysis patients (controls) were matched for age, sex, etiology of end-stage renal disease, and type of arteriovenous access. Basal digital pressure (BDP), digital pressure during manual compression of access, digital brachial index (DBI), change in digital pressure with access compression (CDP), digital pressure of the contralateral side, and bilateral oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) were measured in all patients.\nIn the case group, compression of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) increased mean BDP from 61 \u00b1 26 to 118 \u00b1 28 mm Hg (P < .001), which failed to reach the non-AVF side mean digital pressure of 151 \u00b1 25 mm Hg (P < .001). In addition, O2 Sat of the AVF side was significantly lower than the contralateral side (92.9% \u00b1 2.1% vs 95.6% \u00b1 1.4%; P = .001). Among the controls, manual AVF compression raised the mean BDP from 114 \u00b1 36 mm Hg to 133 \u00b1 29 mm Hg (P < .001), which was still significantly lower than the contralateral side mean digital pressure of 141 \u00b1 30 mm Hg (P = .002). In addition, O2 Sat values of the two sides were different (96.7% \u00b1 2.1% vs 97.1% \u00b1 1.9%; P = .01). Comparing the cases and controls, the mean BDP (61 \u00b1 26 mm Hg vs 114 \u00b1 36 mm Hg; P < .001), DBI (0.44 \u00b1 0.16 vs 0.82 \u00b1 0.19; P < .001), and O2 Sat (92.9% \u00b1 2.1% vs 96.7% \u00b1 2.1%; P < .001) were significantly lower and CDP (57 \u00b1 24 mm Hg vs 19 \u00b1 17 mm Hg; P < .001) was significantly higher in the cases than in the controls. The optimal discriminatory thresholds of 80 mm Hg for BDP, 0.7 for DBI, 40 mm Hg for CDP, and 94% for O2 Sat were determined.\nDigital pressure and O2 Sat measurements are useful additional methods to assist in the clinical evaluation of hemodialysis patients with access-related hand ischemia. BDP <80 mm Hg, DBI <0.7, CDP >40 mm Hg, and O2 Sat <94% are associated with chronic HAIDI.",

    "abstract": "One goal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is to reduce hospital readmissions, with financial penalties applied for excessive rates of unplanned readmissions within 30 days among Medicare beneficiaries. Recent data indicate that as many as 24% of Medicare patients require readmission after vascular surgery, although the rate of readmission after limited digital amputations has not been specifically examined. The present study was therefore undertaken to define the rate of unplanned readmission among patients after digital amputations and to identify the factors associated with these readmissions to allow the clinician to implement strategies to reduce readmission rates in the future.\nThe electronic medical and billing records of all patients undergoing minor amputations (defined as toe or transmetatarsal amputations using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes) from January 2000 through July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected for procedure- and hospital-related variables, level of amputation, length of stay, time to readmission, and level of reamputation. Patient demographics included hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular accident.\nMinor amputations were performed in 717 patients (62.2% male), including toe amputations in 565 (72.8%) and transmetatarsal amputations in 152 (19.5%). Readmission occurred in 100 patients (13.9%), including 28 (3.9%) within 30 days, 28 (3.9%) between 30 and 60 days, and 44 (6.1%) >60 days after the index amputation. Multivariable analysis revealed that elective admission (P < .001), peripheral arterial disease (P < .001), and chronic renal insufficiency (P = .001) were associated with readmission. The reasons for readmission were infection (49%), ischemia (29%), nonhealing wound (19%), and indeterminate (4%). Reamputation occurred in 95 (95%) of the readmitted patients, including limb amputation in 64 (64%) of the patients (below knee in 58, through knee in 2, and above knee in 4).\nReadmission after minor amputation was associated with limb amputation in the majority of cases. This study identified a number of nonmodifiable patient factors that are associated with an increased risk of readmission. Whereas efforts to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions are laudable, payers and regulators should consider these observations in defining unacceptable rates of readmission. Further, although beyond the scope of this study, it is not unreasonable to assume that pressure to reduce readmission rates in the population of patients with extensive comorbidity may induce practitioners to undertake amputation at a higher level initially to minimize the risk of readmission for reamputation and associated financial penalties and thus deprive the patient the chance for limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "Prompt carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in clinically significant carotid stenosis is important in the prevention of neurologic sequelae. The greatest benefit from surgery is obtained by prompt revascularization on diagnosis. It has been demonstrated that black patients both receive CEA less frequently than white patients do and experience worse postoperative outcomes. We sought to test our hypothesis that black race is an independent risk factor for a prolonged time from sonographic diagnosis of carotid stenosis warranting surgery to the day of operation (TDO).\nFrom 1998 to 2013 at a single institution, 166 CEA patients were retrospectively reviewed using Synthetic Derivative, a de-identified electronic medical record. Factors potentially affecting TDO, including demographics, preoperative cardiac stress testing, degree of stenosis, smoking status, and comorbidities, were noted. Multivariate analysis was performed on variables that trended with prolonged TDO on univariate analysis (P < .10) to determine independent (P < .05) predictors of TDO. Subgroup analyses were further performed on the symptomatic and asymptomatic stenosis cohorts.\nThere were 32 black patients and 134 white patients studied; the mean TDO was 78 \u00b1 17 days vs 33 \u00b1 3 days, respectively (P < .001). In addition to the need for preoperative cardiac stress testing, black race was the only variable that demonstrated a trend with (P < .10) or was an independent risk factor for (P < .05) prolonged TDO among all patients (B = 42 days; P < .001) and within the symptomatic (B = 35 days; P = .08) and asymptomatic (B = 35 days; P = .003) cohorts. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, black patients in each stratum of symptomatology (all, symptomatic, and asymptomatic patients) experienced prolonged TDO (log-rank, P < .03 for all three groups).\nBlack race is a risk factor for a temporal delay in CEA for carotid stenosis. Awareness of this disparity may help surgeons avoid undesirable delays in operation for their black patients.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic grafts continue to be required for hemodialysis access when the options for native fistulas have been exhausted. The inferior long-term patency of grafts makes the possibility of preventing occlusion with heparin-bonded grafts an attractive alternative. We carried out a prospective randomized study to compare the patency of standard grafts with heparin-bonded grafts.\nPatients with end-stage renal failure requiring a prosthetic access were randomized to receive either a standard expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) graft or a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft. Patients were enrolled from June 2007 until November 2011 and were followed up until July 2013, when the study concluded.\nIn this study, 160 patients were randomized and followed up for a median of 23.5 months. No patient was lost to follow-up. Primary patency was 35% and 14% for heparin-bonded grafts and 29% and 12% for standard ePTFE grafts at 6 and 12 months, respectively (P = .48). Assisted primary patency was 54%, 41%, and 27% for heparin-bonded grafts and 41%, 30%, and 23% for standard grafts at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively (P = .12). Secondary patency was 83%, 83%, and 81% for heparin-bonded grafts and 81%, 73%, and 68% for standard grafts at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively (P = .33). There were significantly fewer thromboses in heparin-bonded grafts during the first 5 months (P = .020). Of 80 standard grafts, 24 were eventually abandoned vs 17 heparin-bonded grafts (P = .188). Bleeding complications, infections, and intervention rates were similar in both groups.\nHeparin-bonded grafts demonstrated a trend to improved patency, but the difference was not statistically significant. Heparin-bonded grafts had a significantly lower early thrombosis rate that was sustained only for the first 5 months of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The primary end points of this study were safety and efficacy of early cannulation of the Flixene graft (Maquet-Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH). Secondary end points were complications and patency.\nThis is a prospective single-center nonrandomized study. Study data included patient characteristics; history of vascular access; operative technique; interval between implantation and initial cannulation; complications; and patency at 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months. Patency rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nBetween January 2011 and September 2013, a total of 46 Flixene grafts were implanted in 44 patients (27 men) with a mean age of 63 years. The implantation site was the upper arm in 67% of cases, the forearm in 11%, and the thigh in 22%. Seven grafts were never cannulated during the study period. Of the remaining 39 grafts, 32 (82%) were successfully cannulated within the first week after implantation, including 16 (41%) on the first day. The median interval from implantation to initial cannulation was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-3 days). The median follow-up was 223.5 days (interquartile range, 97-600 days). Five hematomas occurred, but only one required surgical revision. Primary assisted and secondary patency rates were 65% and 86%, respectively, at 6 months and 56% and 86%, respectively, at 1 year.\nThis study suggests that cannulation of the Flixene graft within 1 week after implantation is safe and effective. Early cannulation avoids or shortens the need for a temporary catheter. One-year patency rates appeared to be comparable to those achieved with conventional grafts, but long-term follow-up and randomized controlled studies will be needed to confirm this finding.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are associated with improved long-term outcomes but longer maturation times and higher primary failure rates compared with arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). The Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative has recently emphasized tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) avoidance. We sought to characterize the relationship of AVFs and AVGs to the use of TDCs as well as secondary procedures.\nUsing the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) database, we identified incident hemodialysis (HD) patients in 2005 that started HD with a TDC and survived at least 1 year. We then monitored them through 2008. Access creation, TDC removal, TDC placement, and secondary procedures were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes (American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the primary end points.\nIn 2005, HD was initiated in 56,495 patients, 74% with a TDC. Of these, 6286 had an access procedure \u22643 months and 1 year of follow-up (AVF, 4634; AVG, 1652). Mean age was 67.7 years (AVF, 67.3; AVG, 68.7 years; P < .001), 53.3% were men (AVF, 58.1%; AVG, 40.5%; P < .001), and 33.8% were obese (AVF, 33.6%; AVG, 34.4%; P = not significant). AVG placement was associated with a higher TDC removal at 1 (7.9% vs 3.1%; P < .001), 3 (47.8% vs 17.8%; P < .001), and 6 (60.6% vs 47.2%; P < .001) months. There was no difference at 9 months (AVG, 64.9% vs AVF, 62.3%; P = .06). The median time to TDC removal was lower in the AVG group (70 days vs 155 days; P < .001). Multivariable model found AVFs were associated with decreased odds of TDC removal at 3 (odds ratio, 0.22; P < .001) and 6 months (odds ratio, 0.54; P < .001). AVGs required more secondary procedures than AVFs at all time points up to 1 year and specifically had increased thrombectomy procedures (39.8% vs 11.5%; P < .001).\nIn patients starting dialysis with a TDC, AVGs are associated with increased TDC removal and fewer catheter days compared with AVFs at up to 6 months. However, AVGs require more secondary procedures at all time points up to 1 year.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of balloon angioplasty as the primary method of intervention in patients with color duplex ultrasound documented failing bypass grafts and to determine factors that may affect the patency of lower extremity bypass grafts revised by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).\nAll consecutive patients who underwent lower extremity bypass grafts from January 2009 to December 2013 were enrolled in a graft surveillance program. Patients identified as having failing grafts underwent arteriography to confirm the diagnosis with a view to concomitant treatment of the lesion using balloon angioplasty. Procedural success was defined as <30% residual stenosis. Treatment failure was defined as target lesion restenosis or graft occlusion. Descriptive and life-table analyses were performed.\nPTA was used to revise 96 failing grafts in 90 patients. Mean age was 65.8 years (range, 50-88 years), 64% were male, and 66% were symptomatic. Mean follow-up was 18.5 months (range, 3-24 months). Twenty-four grafts (25%) underwent repeat angioplasty for restenosis. Grafts with multiple lesions (P = .009) and grafts aged <6 months from the index operation (P = .004) were the only graft-related variables that showed a significant effect on the longevity of the endovascular revision. The PTA-revised grafts had primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of 56.9%, 83.2%, and 90%, respectively, at 2 years.\nPrimary balloon angioplasty of failing lower extremity bypass grafts, notwithstanding the higher restenosis rate and the need for reintervention, appears to be safe and is associated with acceptable early and medium-term patency rates. Grafts with multiple lesions and those revised \u22646 months of the index operation showed a significant association with the need for a second revision at the same site.",

    "abstract": "Optimal diagnosis and management of median arcuate ligament (MAL) syndrome (MALS) remains unclear in contemporary practice. The advent and evolution of laparoscopic and endovascular techniques has redirected management toward a less invasive therapeutic algorithm. This study examined our contemporary outcomes of patients treated for MALS.\nAll patients treated for MALS at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center from 2000 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics and comorbidities were recorded. Freedom from symptoms and freedom from reintervention were the primary end points. Return to work or school was assessed. Follow-up by clinic visits and telephone allowed quantitative comparisons among the patients.\nDuring the study interval, 21 patients (24% male), with a median age of 42 years, were treated for MALS. All patients complained of abdominal pain in the presence of a celiac stenosis, 16 (76%) also reported weight loss at the time of presentation, and 57% had a concomitant psychiatric history. Diagnostic imaging most commonly used included duplex ultrasound (81%), computed tomography angiography (66%), angiography (57%), and magnetic resonance angiography (5%). Fourteen patients (67%) underwent multiple diagnostic studies. All patients underwent initial laparoscopic MAL release. Seven patients (33%) underwent subsequent celiac stent placement in the setting of recurrent or unresolved symptoms with persistent celiac stenosis at a mean interval of 49 days. Two patients required surgical bypass after an endovascular intervention failed. The 6-month freedom from symptoms was 75% and freedom from reintervention was 64%. Eighteen patients (81%) reported early symptom improvement and weight gain, and 66% were able to return to work.\nA multidisciplinary treatment approach using initial laparoscopic release and subsequent stent placement and bypass surgery provides symptom improvement in most patients treated for MALS. The potential placebo effect, however, remains uncertain. A significant minority of patients will require reintervention, justifying longitudinal surveillance and prudent patient selection. Patients can anticipate functional recovery, weight gain, and return to work with treatment.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of and specific preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in electively treated vascular surgery patients.\nBetween March 2010 and November 2013, all vascular surgery patients were included in a prospective database. Various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors were collected during hospitalization. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of POD. Secondary outcome variables were any surgical complication, hospital length of stay, and mortality.\nIn total, 566 patients were prospectively evaluated; 463 patients were 60 years or older at the time of surgery and formed our study cohort. The median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 66-77), and 76.9% were male. Twenty-two patients (4.8%) developed POD. Factors that differed significantly by univariate analysis included current smoking (P = .001), increased comorbidity (P = .001), hypertension (P = .003), diabetes mellitus (P = .001), cognitive impairment (P < .001), open aortic surgery or amputation surgery (P < .001), elevated C-reactive protein level (P < .001), and blood loss (P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR], 16.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-57.0), open aortic surgery or amputation surgery (OR, 14.0; 95% CI, 3.9-49.8), current smoking (OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 2.8-40.2), hypertension (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 1.9-30.5) and age \u226580 years (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.8-30.1) to be independent predictors of the occurrence of POD. The combination of these parameters allows us to predict delirium with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 92%. The area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating characteristics was 0.93. Delirium was associated with longer hospital length of stay (P < .001), more frequent and increased intensive care unit stays (P = .008 and P = .003, respectively), more surgical complications (P < .001), more postdischarge institutionalization (P < .001), and higher 1-year mortality rates (P = .0026).\nIn vascular surgery patients, preoperative cognitive impairment and open aortic or amputation surgery were highly significant risk factors for the occurrence of POD. In addition, POD was significantly associated with a higher mortality and more institutionalization. Patients with these risk factors should be considered for high-standard delirium care to improve these outcomes.",

The median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 66-77), and 76.9% were male. Twenty-two patients (4.8%) developed POD. Factors that differed significantly by univariate analysis included current smoking (P = .001), increased comorbidity (P = .001), hypertension (P = .003), diabetes mellitus (P = .001), cognitive impairment (P < .001), open aortic surgery or amputation surgery (P < .001), elevated C-reactive protein level (P < .001), and blood loss (P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR], 16.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-57.0), open aortic surgery or amputation surgery (OR, 14.0; 95% CI, 3.9-49.8), current smoking (OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 2.8-40.2), hypertension (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 1.9-30.5) and age \u226580 years (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.8-30.1) to be independent predictors of the occurrence of POD. The combination of these parameters allows us to predict delirium with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 92%. The area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating characteristics was 0.93. Delirium was associated with longer hospital length of stay (P < .001), more frequent and increased intensive care unit stays (P = .008 and P = .003, respectively), more surgical complications (P < .001), more postdischarge institutionalization (P < .001), and higher 1-year mortality rates (P = .0026).",

    "abstract": "Hyperphosphatemia-induced endothelial dysfunction has been shown to play a pathogenic role in the development of atherosclerosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) through unclear mechanisms. Emerging evidence indicates that autophagy is involved in the maintenance of normal cardiovascular function. However, it is unclear whether autophagy participates in the molecular mechanism underlying high phosphate (Pi)-induced endothelial dysfunction.\nThe autophagy activity was determined by the immunofluorescence staining of the expression of endothelial microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in the 5/6 nephrectomy rat model of CKD and sham-operated control rats. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and the activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were determined in cultured human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC-1) endothelial cells that were exposed to a high concentration of Pi with or without the Pi influx blocker phosphonoformic acid, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The impacts of autophagy on Pi-induced apoptotic damage were assessed by flow cytometry.\nThe in vivo rat model of CKD revealed that hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased endothelial LC3 staining. The exposure of HMEC-1 cells to high Pi induced both dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in the LC3-II/LC3-I expression ratio accompanied by the inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In HMEC-1 cells, high Pi-induced autophagy and the inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling were reversed by phosphonoformic acid through the blockage of Pi influx. Apoptosis, characterized by the levels of cleaved caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, along with autophagy was induced by high Pi, and the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine significantly aggravated high Pi-induced apoptosis. The flow cytometry results confirmed that the blockage of autophagy promoted the apoptosis of endothelial cells.\nHyperphosphatemia induces endothelial autophagy, possibly through the inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which may play a protective role against high Pi-induced apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Induction of collateral development to improve tissue perfusion is a promising approach for the treatment of arterial occlusive diseases. Several growth factors and cells have been reported to increase collateral circulation; however, the appropriate site for the delivery of these factors and cells is unclear. In this study, we identified the delivery site for growth factor in a rabbit model of limb ischemia and evaluated whether specific delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to this site enhanced collateral augmentation.\nThe left femoral artery of Japanese white rabbits was excised to induce limb ischemia. Twenty-eight days thereafter, angiograms were obtained to identify the typical pattern of collateral development in this model. Subsequently, bFGF (100 \u03bcg) was selectively injected into the left coccygeofemoral muscle (coccygeo group) or adductor muscle (adductor group), major thigh muscles in proximity. Collateral development was evaluated at 28 days after injection, and its mechanism was assessed by immunologic and morphometric analyses of muscle samples.\nAngiographic evaluation of this model revealed that after femoral artery excision, collateral vessels generally developed in the left coccygeofemoral muscle, whereas few collateral vessels were detected in the left adductor muscle. At 28 days after injection, calf blood pressure ratio, defined as left pressure to right pressure, was significantly higher in the coccygeo group than in the adductor group (0.85 \u00b1 0.05 vs 0.69 \u00b1 0.05, respectively; P < .01). Similar results were observed in blood flow through the internal iliac artery (resting: 24.6 \u00b1 6.1 vs 17.4 \u00b1 8.0 mL/min, P < .01; maximum: 47.4 \u00b1 12.3 vs 33.2 \u00b1 10.7 mL/min, P < .01) and in the angiographic score (0.67 \u00b1 0.13 vs 0.39 \u00b1 0.11; P < .01). Immunologic analyses of the coccygeofemoral muscle at day 3 showed marked expressions of Ki-67, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and FGF receptor 1 in the coccygeo group compared with the adductor group. Morphometric analyses of the same muscle at day 14 also revealed that collateral vessel density and wall thickness were significantly increased in the coccygeal group compared with the adductor group.\nThese findings demonstrated that selective bFGF delivery to the coccygeofemoral muscle markedly improved collateral development and limb perfusion compared with delivery to the adductor muscle, suggesting that site selection is important in increasing therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The low welding strength of laser-assisted vascular anastomosis (LAVA) has hampered the clinical application of LAVA as an alternative to suture anastomosis. To improve welding strength, LAVA in combination with solder and polymeric scaffolds (ssLAVA) has been optimized in vitro. Currently, ssLAVA requires proof-of-concept in a physiologically representative ex vivo model before advancing to in vivo studies. This study therefore investigated the feasibility of ex vivo ssLAVA in medium-sized porcine arteries.\nScaffolds composed of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were impregnated with semisolid solder and placed over coapted aortic segments. ssLAVA was performed with a 670-nm diode laser. In the first substudy, the optimum number of laser spots was determined by bursting pressure analysis. The second substudy investigated the resilience of the welds in a Langendorf-type pulsatile pressure setup, monitoring the number of failed vessels. The type of failure (cohesive vs adhesive) was confirmed by electron microscopy, and thermal damage was assessed histologically. The third substudy compared breaking strength of aortic repairs made with PLGA and semisolid genipin solder (ssLAVR) to repairs made with BioGlue.\nssLAVA with 11 lasing spots and PLGA scaffold yielded the highest bursting pressure (923 \u00b1 56 mm Hg vs 703 \u00b1 96 mm Hg with PCL ssLAVA; P = .0002) and exhibited the fewest failures (20% vs 70% for PCL ssLAVA; P = .0218). The two failed PLGA ssLAVA arteries leaked at 19 and 22 hours, whereas the seven failed PCL ssLAVA arteries burst between 12 and 23 hours. PLGA anastomoses broke adhesively, whereas PCL welds failed cohesively. Both modalities exhibited full-thickness thermal damage. Repairs with PLGA scaffold yielded higher breaking strength than BioGlue repairs (323 \u00b1 28 N/cm(2) vs 25 \u00b1 4 N/cm(2), respectively; P = .0003).\nPLGA ssLAVA yields greater anastomotic strength and fewer anastomotic failures than PCL ssLAVA. Aortic repairs with BioGlue were inferior to those produced with PLGA ssLAVR. The results demonstrate the feasibility of ssLAVA/R as an alternative method to suture anastomosis or tissue sealant. Further studies should focus on reducing thermal damage.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the performance of the Aorfix endograft (Lombard Medical, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom) in standard (<60\u00b0), highly angled (60\u00b0-90\u00b0), and severely angled (>90\u00b0) aortic necks in the PYTHAGORAS study and evaluated changes in neck morphology over time.\nPYTHAGORAS is a prospective nonrandomized clinical trial of the Aorfix endograft. We divided the endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) cohort into groups by standard, high, and severe neck angle. The primary control group was patients concurrently undergoing open repair. Mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years and 30-day freedom from Society for Vascular Surgery major adverse events for the EVAR groups was compared with the open control. Aneurysm sac change, type I and III endoleaks, graft migration, and the reintervention rate at 1 and 2 years was compared between the standard, highly, and severely angled populations. The relative risk of graft complications with a neck diameter increase >10% was also calculated. At predetermined anatomic points, the effect of oversizing on aortic diameter was evaluated by calculating oversize percentage ([1 - outer aortic diameter measured at a given time/stent graft diameter] \u00d7 100%) preoperatively and at 3 years. In addition, the average oversizing percentage at 30 days and annually at 1 to 5 years was compared with the preoperative oversizing percentage. Finally, complication rates with \u226530% vs <30% planned oversizing were compared.\nThe adverse event rate was lower for every EVAR group than the open control. In addition, the mortality rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years were similar between the standard-angle (1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5%), high-angle (0.9%, 7.3%, 13.8%), and severe-angle (4.8%, 9.5%, 14.3%) EVAR groups and the open control groups (1.3, 6.6%, 10.5%). At 1 and 2 years, there was no difference in graft complications among the EVAR groups. However, with neck dilatation of >10% at 5 mm above the proximal renal and 1 mm below the distal renal, there was an increased risk of graft migration (relative risk, 4.38 [P = .01] and 4.33 [P = .002], respectively). For all predetermined anatomic points, the oversizing percentage decreased over time. The rate of oversize percentage decrease was faster at more distal aortic locations, reaching <10% at 30 days 15 mm below the renal, at 2 years 7 mm below the renal, and at 5 years 1 mm below the renal (P < .001 for all). Half the oversize percentage achieved at the index procedure remained at 3 years (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.5). However, there was no difference in complications between the \u226530% and <30% planned oversize groups.\nThe Aorfix endograft has performed well in excluding aneurysms with standard and highly angled aortic neck anatomy.",

    "abstract": "The arteriovenous graft (AVG) is most often used in hemodialysis patients when an autogenous fistula is not feasible. The optimal location (forearm or upper arm) and configuration (loop or straight) of AVGs are not known. To evaluate relationships of AVG location and configuration with patency, we conducted a secondary analysis using data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dipyridamole plus aspirin for newly placed AVG.\nParticipants of the Dialysis Access Consortium (DAC) Graft Study with newly placed upper extremity prosthetic grafts involving the brachial artery were studied. Multivariable analyses adjusting for trial treatment group, center, gender, race, body mass index, diabetes, current treatment with chronic dialysis, and prior arteriovenous vascular access or central venous catheter were performed to compare outcomes of forearm (fAVG) and upper arm (uAVG) grafts, including loss of primary unassisted patency (LPUP) and cumulative primary graft failure (CGF). Subgroup analyses of graft configuration and outflow vein used were also conducted.\nA total of 508 of the 649 participants (78%) enrolled in the trial had an upper extremity brachial artery graft placed, 255 with fAVG and 253 with uAVG. Participants with fAVG were less often male (33% vs 43%; P\u00a0= .03), African American (62% vs 78%; P\u00a0< .001), and receiving dialysis at the time of surgery (62% vs 80%; P\u00a0< .001). Participants with fAVG had a higher mean body mass index (33 vs 29; P\u00a0< .001). The LPUP (fAVG 70% vs uAVG 78%; P\u00a0= .07) and CGF (33% vs 36%; P\u00a0= .91) were similar between fAVG and uAVG at 1-year follow-up. In multivariable analysis, AVG\u00a0location (uAVG vs fAVG) was not associated with LPUP (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.63; P\u00a0= .20) or CGF (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.97; P\u00a0= .10). LPUP did not differ significantly between fAVG and uAVG among subgroups based on AVG configuration (P\u00a0= 1.00) or outflow vein used (P\u00a0= .16).\nPatency was comparable between fAVG and uAVG despite the larger caliber veins often encountered in the upper arm in carefully selected patients. Our findings support the traditional view that, in order to preserve a maximal number of access sites, the forearm location should be considered first before resorting to an upper arm graft.",

    "abstract": "This study compared early and midterm outcomes of polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents (CSs) vs bare-metal stents (BMSs) in the primary treatment of severe TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) C and D iliac artery obstructive lesions.\nBetween January 2009 and June 2014, 128 patients underwent stenting of 167 iliac arteries; CSs were implanted in 82 iliac arteries (49%) and BMSs in 85 (51%). All patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database. Thirty-day outcomes, mid-term patency, limb salvage, and survival were compared, and follow-up results were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves. Clinical presentation, lesion site, extension, and laterality were evaluated for their association with patency in the two groups using multiple logistic regressions.\nPatients were a mean age of 70\u00a0\u00b1 10.3\u00a0years, The Society for Vascular Surgery comorbidity score was 0.89\u00a0\u00b1 0.57, with no differences after stratification by CS and BMS (P\u00a0= .17). Iliac lesions were classified by limb as TASC II C in 86 (51%) and D in 81 (49%). Comparing CS and BMS, technical success was 99% in both groups (P\u00a0= 1.0); the 30-day cumulative surgical complications rate (7.3% vs 4.7%; P\u00a0= .53), mortality (1.8% vs 0%; P\u00a0= .45), and morbidity (1.8% vs 1.4%; P\u00a0= .99) were equivalent. At 24\u00a0months (average 22\u00a0months; range, 30 days-56 months), primary patency of CS vs BMS was similar (93% vs 80%; P\u00a0= .14), and this finding was maintained after stratification by TASC II C (97% vs 93%; P\u00a0= .59) and D (88% vs 61%; P\u00a0= .07); secondary patency was 98% vs 92% (P\u00a0= .22), and limb salvage was 99% and 95% (P\u00a0= .35) respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that BMS in long-segment stenosis involving the common and external iliac arteries was a negative predictor of patency (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.62; P\u00a0= .007); within this subgroup of TASC II D lesions, primary patency at 24\u00a0months was significantly higher for CS than for BMS (88% vs 57%; P\u00a0= .03).\nOverall, the use of CSs for severe iliac lesions has similar early and midterm outcomes compared with BMS. In a subcategory of TASC II D lesions with long-segment severe stenosis of both the common and external iliac arteries, CS should be considered as the primary line of treatment.",

Comparing CS and BMS, technical success was 99% in both groups (P\u00a0= 1.0); the 30-day cumulative surgical complications rate (7.3% vs 4.7%; P\u00a0= .53), mortality (1.8% vs 0%; P\u00a0= .45), and morbidity (1.8% vs 1.4%; P\u00a0= .99) were equivalent. At 24\u00a0months (average 22\u00a0months; range, 30 days-56 months), primary patency of CS vs BMS was similar (93% vs 80%; P\u00a0= .14), and this finding was maintained after stratification by TASC II C (97% vs 93%; P\u00a0= .59) and D (88% vs 61%; P\u00a0= .07); secondary patency was 98% vs 92% (P\u00a0= .22), and limb salvage was 99% and 95% (P\u00a0= .35) respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that BMS in long-segment stenosis involving the common and external iliac arteries was a negative predictor of patency (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.62; P\u00a0= .007); within this subgroup of TASC II D lesions, primary patency at 24\u00a0months was significantly higher for CS than for BMS (88% vs 57%; P\u00a0= .03).",

    "abstract": "The primary preclinical model of peripheral artery disease, which involves acute limb ischemia (ALI), can result in appreciable muscle injury that is attributed to the acuity of the ischemic injury. A less acute model of murine limb ischemia using ameroid constrictors (ACs) has been developed in an attempt to mimic the chronic nature of human disease. However, there is currently little understanding of how genetics influence muscle injury following subacute arterial occlusion in the mouse.\nWe investigated the influence of mouse genetics on skeletal muscle tissue survival, blood flow, and vascular density by subjecting two different mouse strains, C57BL/6 (BL6) and BALB/c, to ALI or subacute limb ischemia using single (1AC) or double (2AC) AC placement on the femoral artery.\nSimilar to ALI, the 2AC model resulted in significant tissue necrosis and limb perfusion deficits in genetically susceptible BALB/c but not BL6 mice. In the 1AC model, no outward evidence of tissue necrosis was observed, and there were no differences in limb blood flow between BL6 and BALB/c. However, BALB/c mice displayed significantly greater muscle injury, as evidenced by increased inflammation and myofiber atrophy, despite having no differences in CD31(+) and SMA(+) vascular density and area. BALB/c mice also displayed significantly greater centralized myonuclei, indicating increased muscle regeneration.\nThe susceptibility of skeletal muscle to ischemia-induced injury is at least partly independent of muscle blood flow and vascular density, consistent with a muscle cell autonomous response that is genetically determined. Further development of preclinical models of peripheral artery disease that more accurately reflect the nature of the human disease may allow more accurate identification of genetic targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are rare neoplasms. Complete surgical resection is the curative therapy and is considered the therapeutic gold standard. This study compared the retrocarotid dissection (RCD) technique with the standard caudocranial dissection (SCCD) technique in operative time, blood loss, vascular or nerve injuries, and hospital stay.\nA retrospective review was conducted of patients with CBTs who underwent surgical treatment with the RCD technique at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition \"Salvador Zubir\u00e1n\" in Mexico City from July 2007 to January 2013. This cohort was compared with an historical cohort treated with standard SCCD from 1995 to 2007 at the same institution.\nA total of 68 procedures (41 SCCD, 27 RCD) were performed in 68 patients (91% women) with a mean age of 54 years (standard deviation [SD], 15 years). According to the Shamblin classification, 6 CBTs were type I (9%), 35 were type II (51%), and 27 were type III (40%). Comparative analysis identified mean blood loss of 480 mL (SD, 380 mL) in the RCD group and 690 mL (SD, 680 mL) for the SCCD cohort (P < .31). The mean procedural time was 172 minutes (SD, 60 minutes) for the RCD group and 260 minutes (SD, 100 minutes) for the SCCD group (P < .001). Hospital stay was significantly shorter for the RCD group with an average of 5 days (SD, 2 days) compared with 9 days (SD, 6 days) for the SCCD cohort (P < .0001). Cranial nerve deficit occurred in 17 patients, consisting of six transient nerve palsies in the RCD cohort and 11 in the SCCD group. Postoperative cerebrovascular accidents occurred in three patients in the SCCD cohort, with none observed in the RCD group. This translates into a rate of 22% of postoperative neurologic complications for the RCD cohort and 34% in the SCCD group (P < .08). Significant differences in intraoperative vascular injuries were not observed.\nThe RCD technique is a safe and viable option for the surgical resection of CBTs. In our experience, this approach was associated with a significant decrease in procedural time and hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the evolution in perioperative outcomes and costs of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) by detailing changes in adjusted outcomes and costs over time.\nNational Inpatient Sample (2000-2011) data were used to evaluate patient characteristics, outcomes, and perioperative costs for elective EVAR performed for intact AAA. Outcomes were adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities, and hospital factors by multivariate analysis. Costs were calculated from hospital cost to charge ratio files and adjusted to 2011 dollars.\nFrom 2000 to 2011, 185,249 patients underwent elective EVAR for intact AAA. The absolute rates of in-hospital major morbidity, mortality, and procedural costs all decreased significantly over time (P\u00a0< .0001). The prevalence of major comorbidities in patients undergoing EVAR, including obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, all increased significantly over time. After adjusting for multiple demographics, comorbidities, and hospital-level factors, recent outcomes of EVAR (2009-2011) remain superior to the early experience (2000-2002) with respect to mortality and major complications.\nFrom 2000-2011, the perioperative outcomes of EVAR improved significantly despite a higher prevalence of comorbidities among patients undergoing repair. Concurrently, procedure-associated costs declined. Advanced technology is often implicated in escalating healthcare spending, and the value of novel techniques is often questioned. These findings highlight that, in the case of EVAR, procedural outcomes have improved while the initial costs of repair have declined over time. EVAR offers an interesting example for stakeholders to consider in the era of cost-containment pressures and criticism of nascent, expensive technology in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Optimal patient selection for lower extremity revascularization remains a clinical challenge among the hemodialysis-dependent (HD). The purpose of this study was to examine contemporary real world open and endovascular outcomes of HD patients to better facilitate patient selection for intervention.\nA regional multicenter registry was queried between 2003 and 2013 for HD patients (N\u00a0= 689) undergoing open surgical bypass (n\u00a0= 295) or endovascular intervention (n\u00a0= 394) for lower extremity revascularization. Patient demographics and comorbidities were recorded. The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes included graft patency, freedom from major adverse limb events, and amputation-free survival (AFS). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for death and amputation.\nAmong the 689 HD patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, 66% were male, and 83% were white. Ninety percent of revascularizations were performed for critical limb ischemia and 8% for claudication. Overall survival at 1, 2, and 5\u00a0years survival remained low at 60%, 43%, and 21%, respectively. Overall 1- and 2-year AFS was 40% and 17%. Mortality accounted for the primary mode of failure for both open bypass (78%) and endovascular interventions (80%) at two years. Survival, AFS, and freedom from major adverse limb event outcomes did not differ significantly between revascularization techniques. At 2\u00a0years, endovascular patency was higher than open bypass (76% vs 26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.71; P\u00a0= .02). Multivariate analysis identified age \u226580\u00a0years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% CI,\u00a01.4-2.5; P\u00a0< .01), indication of rest pain or tissue loss (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6; P\u00a0< .01), preoperative wheelchair/bedridden status (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1; P\u00a0< .01), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9; P\u00a0< .01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; P\u00a0= .01) as independent predictors of death. The presence of three or more risk factors resulted in predicted 1-year mortality of 64%.\nOverall survival and AFS among HD patients remains poor, irrespective of revascularization strategy. Mortality remains the primary driver for these findings and justifies a prudent approach to patient selection. Focus for improved results should emphasize predictors of survival to better identify those most likely to benefit from revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Open surgical repair for acute aortic pathologies involving the visceral vessels is associated with morbidity and mortality rates of 40% to 70% and 30% to 60%, respectively. Due to these poor outcomes, the application of fenestrated/branched endovascular aortic repair (F/B-EVAR) has been expanded in this setting; however, durability remains unknown. The purpose of this analysis was to describe outcomes after F/B-EVAR for acute aortic disease.\nA single center retrospective review of all F/B-EVARs for acute aortic disease was completed. Primary end points included mortality and reintervention-free survival. Secondary end points were patency and freedom from endoleak, as well as change in aneurysm diameter and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Life-tables were used to estimate end points, while mixed statistical models were used to determine aneurysm diameter change.\nThirty-seven patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 67 \u00b1 10 years; 75% male) underwent F/B-EVAR for acute aortic disease, and median follow-up time was 10.3 months (range, 0.5-31.4 months). Indications included thoracoabdominal aneurysm (65%; n = 24), pararenal aneurysm (17%; n = 6), postsurgical anastomotic pseudoaneurysm (8%; n = 3), dissection (5%; n = 2), and penetrating ulcer (5%; n = 2). Mean preoperative aneurysm diameter was 7.3 \u00b1 1.8 cm. All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV or IV-E, and 38% (n = 14) had history of aortic repair. There were 105 visceral vessels revascularized (celiac, 26; superior mesenteric artery, 29; renal, 50) and 24 (65%) patients underwent three- or four-vessel repair. Technical success was 92% (n = 34), with no intraoperative deaths and one conversion (3%). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 2-60 days), and postoperative morbidity was 41% (n = 15; spinal cord ischemia, 14% [8% permanent]; pulmonary, 14%; renal, 14%; extremity ischemia, 8%; stroke, 5%; cardiac, 3%; bleeding, 3%) with 30-day mortality of 19% (n = 7; in-hospital, 8%; n = 3). Endoleak was detected at some point in follow-up in 27% (n = 10), and a majority were type II (n = 7). Six (16%) patients underwent reintervention, and no late conversions occurred. Postoperative imaging was available in 27 (73%), and one celiac fenestration lost patency at 12 months. One-year branch vessel patency and freedom from reintervention was 98% \u00b1 6% and 70% \u00b1 9%, respectively. Estimated 1- and 4-year survival were 70% \u00b1 8% and 67% \u00b1 8%, respectively. During follow-up, aortic diameter decreased 0.5 cm (95% confidence interval, 1.1-0.2; P = .1) while estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 2 mL/min/1.73 m(2).\nF/B-EVAR can be performed to treat a variety of symptomatic and/or ruptured paravisceral aortic pathologies. Perioperative morbidity and mortality can be significant; however, it is less than literature-based outcomes of open repair. Short-term fenestrated/branched graft patency is excellent, but reintervention is frequent, highlighting the need for diligent follow-up. Patients surviving the initial hospitalization for F/B-EVAR of acute aortic disease can anticipate good long-term survival.",

    "abstract": "A recent investigation has documented an increased risk of aneurysm-related complications after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of familial abdominal aortic aneurysms (fAAAs). We hypothesized that fAAA patients are not at increased risk for complications following open AAA repair or EVAR when compared with sporadic abdominal aortic aneurysm (spAAA) patients. To this end, we performed a single institution retrospective review.\nEpidemiologic data were collected through the electronic medical record. Family history data were obtained from a questionnaire administered at the initial vascular surgery consultation. Major adverse events were defined as myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, bowel ischemia, limb ischemia, multisystem organ failure, intracranial hemorrhage, paraplegia, hemorrhage, or death. Endoleaks were classified in accordance with the standardized reporting practices of the Society for Vascular Surgery. AAA-related complications were defined as the need for a secondary intervention due to endoleak, limb ischemia, or postimplantation rupture.\nA total of 392 patients with complete clinical data underwent elective AAA repair from 2004 to 2014. Of these 392 patients, 89 (23%) were classified as fAAA patients and 303 (77%) were classified as spAAA patients. With the exception of increased rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P\u00a0= .0009) and pack-years smoked (P\u00a0= .03) in spAAA patients, demographics did not differ. Sixty-two percent (n\u00a0= 55) of fAAA patients and 68% (n\u00a0= 205) of spAAA patients underwent EVAR (P\u00a0= .30). fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in major adverse events following open AAA repair (fAAA, 9% vs spAAA, 11%; P\u00a0= .75). Additionally, fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in major adverse events following EVAR (fAAA, 4% vs spAAA, 5%; P\u00a0= .70). Patients with fAAA did have a significantly increased rate of endoleak (fAAA, 24% vs spAAA, 12%; P\u00a0= .03) and secondary intervention following EVAR (fAAA, 21% vs spAAA, 12%; P\u00a0= .04).\nThe current study shows that patients with fAAA do not have increased perioperative morbidity following open or endovascular AAA repair. However, patients with fAAA do have an increased risk of endoleak and secondary intervention following EVAR. These findings suggest that EVAR and open AAA repair are both safe and effective for fAAA patients. The increased rate of endoleak and secondary intervention in patients with fAAA suggests that this subpopulation may benefit from closer post-EVAR surveillance or open surgical repair in good risk patients.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed readmissions and their associated hospital costs after common vascular surgeries at a single institution.\nPatients undergoing open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, aortoiliac revascularization, or infrainguinal revascularization, from 2010 through 2012, were retrospectively evaluated. We compared 30- and 90-day readmission rates and costs by procedure group, and we tabulated reasons for readmission and procedures performed during readmission. We used both American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data and patient records; as NSQIP only captures 30-day data, we retrospectively reviewed patient charts to extend the evaluation to 90 days. Analyses were performed using parametric or nonparametric methods as appropriate.\nTwo hundred nineteen cases were analyzed; the overall rate of index admission survivors experiencing at least one readmission within 30 days was 17% and within 90 days, 27%. Median readmission costs were $10,700, which added 39% to the median index costs of $27,700. Over half of readmissions (55%) included an operation. The most common cause for readmission was related to wound complications, comprising approximately 30% of the entire readmission cohort. Independent drivers of readmission costs were the need for additional surgical procedures, the use of intensive care unit services, and the number of days spent in the hospital above the median. Total 90-day costs were statistically equivalent between open and endovascular procedures when including readmissions.\nWe found that vascular surgery readmissions occur at a rate of 17% at 30 days and 27% at 90 days. When including the costs of readmission for a wide variety of common vascular cases, there is no significant difference in total costs between endovascular and open procedures at 90 days.",

Median readmission costs were $10,700, which added 39% to the median index costs of $27,700. Over half of readmissions (55%) included an operation. The most common cause for readmission was related to wound complications, comprising approximately 30% of the entire readmission cohort. Independent drivers of readmission costs were the need for additional surgical procedures, the use of intensive care unit services, and the number of days spent in the hospital above the median. Total 90-day costs were statistically equivalent between open and endovascular procedures when including readmissions.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis vascular accesses (VAs) are traditionally planned based on the nondominant upper extremity preoperative physical and sonographic vascular findings. Clinical guidelines advocate the use of the most suitably distended vein in the most distal location. Brachial plexus block (BPB), through its sympathectomy-like effect, promotes vasodilation and can thus further optimize vein recruitment and operative strategy. However, studies on its role in driving primary distal autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) placement are limited. We therefore evaluated a traditional approach of clinic-based VA planning against an on-table sonography-guided strategy under BPB.\nThis was a prospective observational study involving 110 consecutive end-stage renal disease multiethnic Asian patients referred for primary VA creation under BPB after preoperative venous mapping. Cases were grouped according to whether there was a preset operative plan for radial cephalic (RC) or brachial cephalic (BC) AVF creation based on artery and vein >2\u00a0mm and >2.5\u00a0mm size criteria respectively (group A) or vein size or length were suboptimal (2-2.5\u00a0mm and\u00a0<5\u00a0cm respectively), thus precluding any operative plan till after BPB (group B). Group B also included cases with a preset VA plan but that subsequently underwent an on-table change in operative plan as a result of more favorable distal vein dilation post-BPB. RC AVF recruitment, maturation, and patency rates were compared in the two groups over a 1-year follow up.\nOne hundred RC and BC AVF were available for analysis after excluding brachial AVFs and grafts: 41 in group A and 59 in group B. Twenty one (51%) primary RC AVFs were created according to a preset preoperative plan compared with 37 (63%) based upon on-table planning or plan modification (P > .05). Satisfactory post-BPB forearm vasodilation resulted in 44% of 36 plans for BC being changed to RC AVFs. RC AVF 6-week hemodynamic maturation and 3-month functional maturation in group A vs B were 48% vs 60% and 69% vs 57%, respectively (P > .05). One-year primary and secondary patency rates were 57% vs 50% and 73% vs 87%, respectively (log rank >.05). Outcomes of RC AVFs in group B were not inferior to those of BC AVFs.\nOn-table BPB-driven VA planning and plan modification strategy contribute to considerable AVF recruitment but do not lead to significantly better distal AVF prevalence or outcomes over the traditional approach. An adequately powered randomized controlled study is, however, warranted to better assess the long-term clinical and cost benefits of such a strategy.",

    "abstract": "Arterial acute mesenteric ischemia (AAMI) is a vascular and gastroenterologic emergency, most often surgical, still associated with a poor prognosis and frequent short bowel syndrome in survivors. We report the results of revascularization in AAMI patients after the creation of an intestinal stroke center.\nSince July 2009, we developed a multimodal and multidisciplinary management for AMI, focusing on intestinal viability and involving gastroenterologists, vascular and abdominal surgeons, radiologists, and intensive care specialists. This management was the first step to the creation of an intestinal stroke center, based on the stroke unit model. All patients received: (1) a specific medical protocol; (2) endovascular and/or open surgical revascularization whenever possible; and/or (3) resection of non-viable small bowel. We aimed to study survival, morbidity, type of revascularization, and bowel resection in patients who benefited from arterial revascularization in our intestinal stroke center.\nEighty-three patients with AMI were prospectively enrolled in the intestinal stroke center. Among them, 29 patients with AAMI underwent revascularization. The mean age was 50.2\u00a0\u00b1 12\u00a0years, with 41% of male gender. The mean follow-up was 22.7\u00a0\u00b1 19\u00a0months. Overall 2-year survival was 89.2%, and 30-day operative mortality was 6.9%. Surgical revascularization included bypass grafting (65%), endarterectomy with patch angioplasty (21%)\u00a0\u00b1 retrograde open mesenteric stenting of the superior mesenteric artery (7%), and endovascular revascularization as first stage procedure (38%). The 2-year primary patency rate of open revascularization was 88%. The rate and the median length of bowel resected were 24% and 43\u00a0cm (range, 36-49\u00a0cm), respectively.\nIn our experience, revascularization of AAMI patients as part of a multidisciplinary and multimodal management leads to encouraging results. Vascular surgeons have a central role in a dedicated intestinal stroke center.",

    "abstract": "Low-profile (LP) stent grafts are now commercially available in Europe for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). In this study the midterm outcomes and characteristics of patients treated with this last generation of stent grafts were compared with a cohort of patients treated with \"standard-profile\" (SP) stent grafts.\nThe current study enrolled all patients treated for elective EVAR by the SP Zenith Flex stent graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) between March 2010 and November 2011 and patients treated for elective EVAR by the Zenith LP stent graft (Cook Medical) between November 2011 and March 2013. All patients had a follow-up >18 months. Preoperative computed tomography angiograms were analyzed on a dedicated three-dimensional workstation. All data were prospectively collected in an electronic database and retrospectively analyzed. A comparative study was conducted.\nThe present study included 208 patients (107 SP and 101 LP). Patients' physiologic characteristics were similar in both groups. The iliac anatomy was considered \"more challenging\" in LP patients: respectively, 7% and 22% (P = .002) of SP and LP patients had bilateral external iliac diameter <7 mm; and 16% and 34% (P = .005) had a combination of an external iliac diameter <7 mm and an iliac tortuosity ratio index >1.5. No 30-day deaths were documented. The 24-month freedom from reintervention and overall survival rates after SP and LP were, respectively, 88% and 91% (P = .450) and 92% and 96% (P = .153). The 24-month rates for freedom from sac expansion and from limb occlusion were 96.4% and 98.7% (P = .320) and 92% and 95% (P = .293), respectively. One patient in each group presented with a type I endoleak during follow-up, and two LP patients presented with a type III endoleak (P = .235).\nThis study demonstrates that the last-generation LP stent grafts have favorable midterm outcomes similar to SP stent grafts despite being used to treat more patients with unfavorable iliac anatomy.",

This prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study was conducted in Europe, Japan, and the United States. The main anatomical inclusion criteria included proximal neck seal zone of \u226520 mm, aortic arch radius of \u226520 mm, and a neck diameter of 15 to 42 mm. Patients were evaluated preprocedure, predischarge, and postdischarge 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter through 5 years.\nBetween March 2010 and January 2013, 110 patients (64 men and 46 women; mean age, 72 \u00b1 10 years) were enrolled in the study for the treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (n = 90) or ulcers (n = 20). Access was percutaneous in 36% (40 of 110) of patients. The study device was successfully implanted in all but two patients (both due to inability to gain access or advance to the target treatment site). There was no 30-day mortality. Five deaths occurred \u22641 year (only one was aneurysm-related by independent adjudication), resulting in a 95% freedom from all-cause mortality and a 99% freedom from thoracic aortic aneurysm-related mortality. At one or more time points \u22641 year, type I endoleak (all distal) was observed in 4 patients, type III endoleak in 2, and aneurysm growth in 4. Five patients experienced stroke \u22641 year (2 procedure-related). No aortic rupture, paraplegia, paralysis, or permanent spinal cord injury was observed \u22641 year.\nEarly outcomes after Zenith Alpha implantation appear promising and suggest expanded thoracic endovascular aortic repair applicability in patients with smaller access vessels. Longer-term follow-up is ongoing.",

Five deaths occurred \u22641 year (only one was aneurysm-related by independent adjudication), resulting in a 95% freedom from all-cause mortality and a 99% freedom from thoracic aortic aneurysm-related mortality. At one or more time points \u22641 year, type I endoleak (all distal) was observed in 4 patients, type III endoleak in 2, and aneurysm growth in 4. Five patients experienced stroke \u22641 year (2 procedure-related). No aortic rupture, paraplegia, paralysis, or permanent spinal cord injury was observed \u22641 year.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms is a safe alternative to open aneurysm repair (OAR) in selected patients. The aim of this study was to compare the health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) outcomes of patients following EVAR and OAR.\nA literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library identified five randomized trials that reported on HR-QoL in EVAR and OAR for elective management of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. No consistent HR-QOL instrument was used among the studies. A meta-analysis was performed on the 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) HR-QoL results.\nSF-36 general health scores were higher for EVAR at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. SF-36 physical functioning scores were higher for EVAR at 6 months but this advantage was lost at 12 months. In addition, SF-36 social functioning scores were higher for EVAR at 12 months. SF-36 component summary scores were not significantly different. EVAR was associated with a better EQ-5D score at 3, 6, and 12 months, but not at 24 months of follow-up.\nEVAR was associated with better HR-QoL in some domains up to 12 months postoperatively. There is insufficient data to demonstrate a HR-QoL advantage beyond 12 months. More studies are required to examine any long-term HR-QoL advantages for either intervention.",

We hypothesized that CEA would be associated with superior performance on detailed domain-specific cognitive testing compared with CAS.\nPatients with >80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis were randomized to CEA or CAS with side of stenosis balanced across condition. A robust battery of tests was used to assess the cognitive domains of attention, memory, mood, visual-spatial skills, motor ability, processing speed, and executive functioning \u226410 days preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 6 months. Tests were administered using standardized conditions and were scored by individuals blinded to treatment allocation.\nBaseline cognitive performance was similar between CAS (n = 29) and CEA (n = 31) groups (P > .05). Relative to baseline, verbal and visual memory and attention functions substantially improved in the CAS and CEA groups at 6 months (multiple cognitive tests achieved statistical significance). Compared with CEA, cognitive processing speed (Stroop Color test: 9.0 vs 7.3, P = .04; and Stroop Word test: 9.0 vs 7.4, P = .05) was superior in the CAS group at 6 weeks. Executive functioning (phonemic verbal fluency: 10.6 vs 8.4, P = .043) and motor function (Grooved Pegboard of nondominant extremity: 45.7 vs 38.9, P = .022) were also superior in the CAS group at 6 months. Tests of attention, memory, and visual-spatial skills were similar between CAS and CEA patients at 6 weeks and 6 months.\nCarotid revascularization improves memory and attention within the first 6 postoperative months.

    "abstract": "The objective of this multicenter registry was to review current treatments and late results of repair of aneurysm of aberrant right subclavian artery (AARSA).\nAll consecutive AARSA repairs from 2006 to 2013 in seven centers were reviewed. End points were 30-day and late mortality, reintervention rate, and AARSA-related death.\nTwenty-one AARSA repairs were included (57% men; mean age, 67 years); 3 ruptures (14%) required emergent treatment; 12 (57%) were symptomatic for dysphagia (33%), dysphonia (24%), or pain (19%). Eight cases (38%) presented with thoracic aortic aneurysm, two with intramural hematoma, and one with acute type B aortic dissection. Mean AARSA diameter was 4.2 cm; a single bicarotid common trunk was present in 38% of cases. The majority of patients underwent hybrid intervention (n = 15; 71%) consisting of single (n = 2) or bilateral (n = 12) subclavian to carotid transposition or bypass or ascending aorta to subclavian bypass (n = 1) plus thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR); 19% of cases underwent open repair and 9% simple TEVAR with AARSA overstenting. Perioperative death occurred in two patients (9%): in one case after TEVAR in ruptured AARSA, requiring secondary sternotomy and aortic banding; and in an elective case due to multiorgan failure after a hybrid procedure. Median follow-up was 30 (interquartile range, 15-46) months. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 36 months was 90% (standard error, 0.64). Late AARSA-related death in one case was due to AARSA-esophageal fistula presenting with continuing backflow from distal AARSA and previous TEVAR. At computed tomography controls, one type I endoleak and one type II endoleak were detected; the latter required reintervention by aneurysm wrapping and ligature of collaterals. AARSA-related death was more frequent after TEVAR, a procedure reserved for ruptures, compared with elective open or hybrid repair.\nHybrid repair is the preferred therapeutic option for patients presenting with AARSA. Midterm results show high rates of clinical success with low risk of reintervention. Simple endografting presents high risk of related death; these findings underline the importance of achieving complete sealing to avoid treatment failures.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of acute, complicated type B aortic dissection has evolved in the past several decades. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair when anatomy is suitable, has been regarded as the preferable treatment to seal the primary entry tear, redirect and re-establish adequate true lumen flow, and thereby promote aortic remodeling. This study was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of a conformable thoracic endoprosthesis device for patients with acute, complicated type B aortic dissection, defined as malperfusion or rupture or both.\nBetween January 2010 and January 2012, 50 patients with complicated type B aortic dissection from 26 sites in the United States were included in this prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized single-arm study. The primary safety end point was all-cause mortality through 30 days after treatment, and the primary efficacy end point was exclusion of the primary entry tear (Core Laboratory adjudicated) at 1-month follow-up. Secondary end points included false lumen thrombosis, dissection-based reintervention rate, and aortic rupture.\nAll device implants were successfully completed. Six patients (12%) required additional device implantations \u22641 year from the index procedure. There was no conversion to open repair at 1 year. Exclusion of the primary entry tear at 30 days occurred in 97.5% of patients. All-cause mortality through 30 days was 8%. Survival was 88% at 1 year and 85% at 2 years. At 1 year after treatment, 35.1% of patients had experienced a decrease of \u22655 mm in overall diameter in the treated segment of the aorta. From pretreatment to the 36-month follow-up, the average minimum true lumen area increased by 206.3 mm(2), and the average maximum false lumen area decreased by 313.4 mm(2). The 30-day stroke rate was 18%; none were fatal, and one permanent deficit occurred. Four patients (8%) experienced spinal cord ischemia of any severity but without any permanent or significant deficits. New aortic dissection (3 retrograde, 2 de novo) occurred in five patients (10%). The secondary intervention rate was 18%.\nTreatment with the conformable thoracic endovascular aortic repair device produced favorable perioperative and intermediate level clinical and anatomic outcomes. In particular, an operative mortality of 8% in this cohort is comparable to that noted in a Society for Vascular Surgery objective performance criteria publication. Late survival in our cohort compares favorably with historical data referable to complicated type B dissection.",

    "abstract": "The volume and complexity of endovascular procedures are increasing. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) made precise three-dimensional (3D) planning of these procedures possible, but intraoperative imaging, even with the use of modern flat-panel detectors, is limited to two dimensions. Flat detectors, however, allow C-arm cone-beam CT. This technology can be used to generate a 3D data set that can be fused with a preoperative high-resolution CT scan, thus generating a live 3D roadmap. We hypothesized that use of a novel image fusion software, VesselNavigator (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), facilitates precise and expeditious procedures and therefore reduces radiation exposure and contrast agent dose.\nA retrospective review of patients undergoing standard aortobi-iliac endovascular aneurysm repair at our institution between January 2011 and April 2014 was performed. Conventional imaging was compared with VesselNavigator-assisted imaging, and a matched analysis based on body mass index (BMI) was performed because of the dependence of radiation dose on body habitus. Outcome parameters were procedure time, fluoroscopy time, radiation, and contrast agent dose.\nA total of 75 patients were identified. After matching based on BMI, control and VesselNavigator groups each had 16 patients with BMI of 27.0 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m(2) and 27.0 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m(2), respectively (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). R(2) was 6.37 \u00d7 10(-7). Radiation dose measured as air kerma was lower with VesselNavigator (1067 \u00b1 470.4 mGy vs 1768 \u00b1 696.2 mGy; P = .004). Fluoroscopy time was shorter (18.4 \u00b1 6.8 minutes vs 26.8 \u00b1 10.0 minutes; P = .01) and contrast agent dose was lower (37.4 \u00b1 21.3 mL vs 77.3 \u00b1 23.0 mL; P < .001) with VesselNavigator compared with control. Procedure time was also shorter with VesselNavigator (80.4 \u00b1 21.2 minutes vs 110.0 \u00b1 29.1 minutes; P = .005).\nImage fusion using VesselNavigator enhances the functionality of conventional fluoroscopy in standard endovascular aneurysm repair. It reduces radiation exposure to patients and providers. It also limits the amount of contrast agent and shortens the overall procedure length. The benefit of this technology is demonstrated on this typically straightforward procedure but may be even more useful for complex procedures.",

Patient demographics, comorbidities, interventional complications, and 30-day mortality were recorded.\nThe study included 90 patients (60% male). Mean age was 66 years (range, 17-97 years). Hypertension was found in 69% of the patients, 37% were diabetic, 57% had a history of tobacco abuse, and 65% had chronic renal insufficiency. The median preprocedure cardiac ejection fraction was 30%. Most (87%) had undergone coronary artery intervention. Cardiogenic shock was documented in 67 patients (74%).

    "abstract": "In 2009, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) established objective performance goals (OPG) for lower extremity bypass (LEB) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) based on pooled data from previously performed prospective studies in an effort to provide a benchmark and historical control for future trials. However, patients with a prosthetic conduit and end-stage renal disease were excluded from this cohort. In contemporary practice, many patients do not meet the criteria for SVS OPG inclusion, making generalization of the SVS OPG difficult. The goal of this study was to establish safety and efficacy measures for patients who were excluded from the original SVS OPG analysis.\nAll patients who underwent LEB for CLI in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) from 2003 to 2013 were identified. Patients were stratified into OPG-eligible and non-OPG-eligible cohorts. Outcomes included 30-day major adverse limb events, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events, 1-year survival, and 1-year freedom from amputation. The SVS OPG methodology was used to create new performance goals for the non-OPG-eligible patients.\nWe identified 3609 patients: 2360 OPG (65%) vs 1249 non-OPG (35%), and overall results were stratified as a function of OPG status. The 30-day major adverse limb event rate was 5.0% (5.5% non-OPG vs 4.4% OPG; P = .34), and the 30-day major adverse cardiovascular event rate was 7.3% (9.2% non-OPG vs 6.2% OPG; P = .001). At 1 year, survival was 84% (75.9% non-OPG vs 88.3% OPG; P < .001), and freedom from amputation was 86.9% (80.9% non-OPG vs 90.1% OPG; P < .001).\nThe SVS OPG were attainable in New England for the population of patients who would have met SVS OPG study cohort inclusion criteria. However, 35% of the patients who underwent LEB for CLI in the last 10 years fell outside of these criteria by having end-stage renal disease or requiring a prosthetic conduit. We therefore suggest new benchmarks for these high-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported on the role of postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with varying results. Most of these studies had a small sample size or did not analyze cost-effectiveness.\nWe analyzed 489 of 501 CEA patients with patch closure. All patients had immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound examination and were routinely followed up both clinically and with duplex ultrasound at regular intervals of 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the rate of \u226550% and \u226580% post-CEA restenosis over time and the time frame of progression from normal to \u226550% or \u226580% restenosis. The cost of post-CEA duplex surveillance was also estimated.\nOverall, 489 patients with a mean age of 68.5 years were analyzed. Ten of these had residual postoperative \u226550% stenosis, and 37 did not undergo a second duplex ultrasound examination and therefore were not included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 1-63 months), with a mean number of duplex ultrasound examinations of 3.6 (range, 1-7). Eleven of 397 patients (2.8%) with a normal finding on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound vs 4 of 45 (8.9%) with mild stenosis on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound progressed to \u226550% restenosis (P = .055). Overall, 15 patients (3.1%) had \u226550% restenosis, 9 with 50% to <80% and 4 with 80% to 99% (2 of these had carotid artery stenting reintervention), and 2 had late carotid occlusion. All of these were asymptomatic, except for one who had a transient ischemic attack. The mean time to \u226550% to <80% restenosis was 14.7 months vs 19.8 months for \u226580% restenosis after the CEA. Freedom from restenosis rates were 98%, 96%, 94%, 94%, and 94% for \u226550% restenosis and 99%, 98%, 97%, 97%, and 97% for \u226580% restenosis at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years, respectively. Freedom from myocardial infarction, stroke, and deaths was not significantly different between patients with and without restenosis (100%, 93%, 83%, and 83% vs 94%, 91%, 86%, and 79% at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years, respectively; P = .951). The estimated charge of this surveillance was 3.6 \u00d7 489 (number of CEAs) \u00d7 $800 (charge for carotid duplex ultrasound), which equals $1,408,320, to detect only four patients with \u226580% to 99% restenosis who may have been potential candidates for reintervention.\nThis study shows that the value of routine postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance after CEA with patch closure may be limited, particularly if the finding on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound is normal or shows minimal disease.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the association of intraoperative completion imaging (CI) for lower extremity vein bypass to a below-knee target with primary patency in the Vascular Quality Initiative.\nThe Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried from January 2003 to October 2013 for lower extremity bypass (LEB) procedures that were elective, had an indication of occlusive disease, used a single-segment greater saphenous vein conduit, and had a below-knee target. LEBs with inflow arteries above the knee and below the knee were included. LEBs with concomitant endovascular procedures were excluded. CI was defined as completion angiography, completion duplex ultrasound, or both. The end points were primary patency at discharge and at 1 year. Multivariable analysis was performed controlling for patient demographics, comorbidities, bypass characteristics, and center.\nOf 14,284 LEBs that were performed during the study period, 3147 satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of 1457 (46%) that underwent CI, 287 (20%) underwent duplex ultrasound, 1116 (77%) underwent angiography, and 54 (3.7%) underwent both duplex ultrasound and angiography. There were more patients in the CI group with a history of smoking and a bypass graft crossing the knee. There was no difference in primary patency at discharge between the two groups (CI, 93.2% vs no CI, 93.8%; P = .52). Of the patients who underwent CI, the discharge primary patency was 95.1% for completion duplex ultrasound vs 92.8% for completion angiography (P = .17). On multivariable analysis, there was no significant association of CI with discharge primary patency (P = .69). The 1-year primary patency was 63% in the CI group vs 68% in the no CI group (P = .051). The 1-year primary patency was 60% for the duplex ultrasound group vs 65% for the angiography group (P = .61). On multivariable analysis, there was no significant association of CI with 1-year primary patency (P = .69).\nIn electively performed LEBs using single-segment saphenous vein to a below-knee target artery for occlusive disease, CI does not influence primary graft patency at discharge or at 1 year.",

    "abstract": "Vascular reconstruction can facilitate pancreas tumor resection, but optimal methods of reconstruction are not well studied. We report our results for portal vein reconstruction (PVR) for pancreatic resection and determinants of postoperative patency.\nWe identified 173 patients with PVR in a prospective database of 6522 patients who underwent pancreatic resection at our hospital from 1970 to 2014. There were 128 patients who had >1 year of follow-up with computed tomography imaging. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were recorded. Patients with and without postoperative PVR thrombosis were compared by univariable, multivariable, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.\nThe survival of patients was 100% at 1 month, 88% at 6 months, 66% at 1 year, and 39% on overall median follow-up of 310 days (interquartile range, 417 days). Median survival was 15.5 months (interquartile range, 25 months); 86% of resections were for cancer. Four types of PVR techniques were used: 83% of PVRs were performed by primary repair, 8.7% with interposition vein graft, 4.7% with interposition prosthetic graft, and 4.7% with patch. PVR patency was 100% at 1 day, 98% at 1 month, 91% at 6 months, and 83% at 1 year. Patients with PVR thrombosis were not significantly different from patients with patent PVR in age, survival, preoperative comorbidities, tumor characteristics, perioperative blood loss or transfusion, or postoperative complications. They were more likely to have had preoperative chemotherapy (53% vs 9%; P < .0001), radiation therapy (35% vs 2%; P < .0001), and prolonged operative time (618 \u00b1 57 vs 424 \u00b1 20 minutes; P = .002) and to develop postoperative ascites (76% vs 22%; P < .001). Among patients who developed ascites, 38% of those with PVR thrombosis did so in the setting of tumor recurrence at the porta detected on imaging, whereas among patients with patent PVR, 50% did so (P = .73). Patients with PVR thrombosis were more likely to have had prosthetic graft placement compared with patients with patent PVRs (18% vs 2.7%; P = .03; odds ratio [OR], 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-42). PVR patency overall was significantly worse for patients who had an interposition prosthetic graft reconstruction (log-rank, P = .04). On multivariable analysis, operative time (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02) and prosthetic graft placement (OR, 8.12; 95% CI, 1.1-74) were independent predictors of PVR thrombosis (C statistic = 0.88).\nLong operative times and use of prosthetic grafts for reconstruction are risk factors for postoperative portal vein thrombosis. Primary repair, patch, or vein interposition should be preferentially used for PVR in the setting of pancreatic resection.",

They were more likely to have had preoperative chemotherapy (53% vs 9%; P < .0001), radiation therapy (35% vs 2%; P < .0001), and prolonged operative time (618 \u00b1 57 vs 424 \u00b1 20 minutes; P = .002) and to develop postoperative ascites (76% vs 22%; P < .001). Among patients who developed ascites, 38% of those with PVR thrombosis did so in the setting of tumor recurrence at the porta detected on imaging, whereas among patients with patent PVR, 50% did so (P = .73). Patients with PVR thrombosis were more likely to have had prosthetic graft placement compared with patients with patent PVRs (18% vs 2.7%; P = .03; odds ratio [OR], 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-42). PVR patency overall was significantly worse for patients who had an interposition prosthetic graft reconstruction (log-rank, P = .04). On multivariable analysis, operative time (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02) and prosthetic graft placement (OR, 8.12; 95% CI, 1.1-74) were independent predictors of PVR thrombosis (C statistic = 0.88).",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in endograft devices, operator technique, and patient selection, endovascular repair has not achieved the long-term durability of open surgical aneurysm repair. Persistent or recurrent aneurysm sac flow from failed proximal sealing, component failure, or branch vessel flow underpins a significant rate of reintervention after endovascular repair. The Nellix device (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) employs a unique design with deployment of polymer-filled EndoBags surrounding the endograft flow lumens, sealing the aneurysm sac space and potentially reducing complications from persistent sac flow. This retrospective analysis represents the initial experience in consecutive patients treated with the device in real-world practice.\nThis study was performed at six clinical centers in Europe and one in New Zealand during the initial period after commercialization of the Nellix device. Patients underwent evaluation with computed tomography and other imaging modalities following local standards of care. Patients were selected for treatment with Nellix and treated by each institution according to its endovascular repair protocol. Clinical and imaging end points included technical success (successful device deployment and absence of any endoleak at completion angiography), freedom from all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality, endoleak by type, limb occlusion, aneurysm rupture, and reintervention.\nDuring a 17-month period, 171 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated with the Nellix device and observed for a median of 5 months (range, 0-14 months). The 153 male and 18 female patients with mean age of 74 \u00b1 7 years had aneurysms 61 \u00b1 9 mm in diameter with an average infrarenal neck length of 28 \u00b1 15 mm and infrarenal angulation of 37 \u00b1 22 degrees. Technical success was achieved in all but two patients (99%); one patient had a type Ib endoleak and another had a type II endoleak. Through the last available follow-up, type Ia endoleak was observed in five patients (3%), type Ib endoleak in four patients (2%), and type II endoleak in four patients (2%). There were eight limb occlusions (5%), among which seven were evident at the 1-month follow-up visit. Aneurysm-related reinterventions were performed in 15 patients (9%). There were no aneurysm ruptures or open surgical conversions.\nThis first multicenter postmarket report of the Nellix device for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair demonstrates satisfactory results during the initial learning phase of this new technology. The rate of aneurysm exclusion was high, and frequency of complications was low. More definitive conclusions on the value of this novel device await the results of the ongoing Nellix EVAS FORWARD Global Registry and the EVAS FORWARD investigational device exemption trial.",

    "abstract": "More than 85% of patients with end-stage renal disease start dialysis through a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) for long periods while their arteriovenous fistula or vascular access graft (arteriovenous graft [AVG]) matures. Because TDCs are associated with a high risk of complications, including death and infection, use of an AVG that can be cannulated safely immediately after implantation may reduce morbidity in these patients by allowing earlier TDC removal. We report a prospective multicenter study of a new early-cannulation AVG (Gore ACUSEAL Vascular Graft; W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz).\nPatients requiring creation of a prosthetic vascular access for hemodialysis were enrolled between July 2010 and February 2012 and observed for 12 months. Data were collected on the patients' baseline characteristics; location, position, loss of patency, and revisions of prior AVGs; dialysis sessions using the AVG; and major adverse events related to graft implantation or cannulation. Cumulative and primary unassisted graft patency rates were calculated. A subgroup analysis compared outcomes in patients in whom the AVG was first cannulated within 72 hours after implantation with outcomes in patients in whom the initial cannulation was performed >21 days postoperatively.\nThe population of this study was formed by 138 patients who received an ACUSEAL graft. During follow-up, 17 patients died and the AVG was abandoned in 27. The median value for follow-up was 360 days for all patients (variance 15,387). The overall mean time to initial cannulation was 15 days, with 54 grafts (40%) first cannulated within 72 hours after graft implantation and 33 grafts first cannulated >21 days afterward. The reason for late cannulation in some patients was dependent on the implanting surgeon's decision and the surgeon's personal experience with early cannulating grafts. The 1-year overall cumulative patency rate was 79% (95% confidence interval, 71%-85%); the primary unassisted patency rate was 35% (95% confidence interval, 27%-44%). Adverse events included 6 hematomas (two of which were related to cannulation and occurred 107 and 169 days, respectively, after AVG implantation), 15 graft infections, and 15 cases of steal syndrome requiring intervention. Patients in the early- and later-cannulation groups had similar characteristics and no significant differences in rates of cumulative or primary unassisted patency or adverse events.\nThis study demonstrated that the new, early-cannulation AVG graft can be cannulated soon after implantation without a significant difference in patency and complication rates compared with rates associated with standard cannulation of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in the literature. This new AVG may allow early removal or avoidance of TDC use in patients undergoing hemodialysis, potentially reducing or eliminating the number of days of catheter-dependent dialysis, but further studies will be needed to demonstrate this potential.",

    "abstract": "Advances in endovascular technology have led to the successful treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, there is currently no consensus on what constitutes a juxtarenal, pararenal, or suprarenal aneurysm. There is emerging evidence that the extent of the aneurysm repair is associated with outcome. We compare the outcomes of 150 consecutive patients treated with a fenestrated or branched stent graft and present the data stratified according to the Society for Vascular Surgery classification based on proximal anatomic landing zones.\nA prospectively collected database of consecutive patients undergoing fenestrated or branched stent graft insertion in a tertiary center between 2008 and 2013 was retrospectively analyzed. Aneurysms were subdivided into zones according to where the area of proximal seal could be achieved in relation to the visceral arteries. Zone 8 covers the renal arteries, zone 7 covers the superior mesenteric artery, and zone 6 covers the celiac axis. Patient demographics, operative variables, mortality, and major morbidity were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis to assess for differences between zones.\nDuring the study period, 150 patients were treated. There were 49 in zone 8, 76 in zone 7, and 25 in zone 6. Prior aortic surgery had been performed in 19 patients, which included 11 patients with previous endovascular aneurysm repairs. There was significantly increased blood loss (P < .001), operative time (P < .0001), total hospital stay (P = .018), and intensive care unit stay (P < .0001) as the zones ascended the aorta. There were 14 inpatient deaths recorded across all zones with a 30-day mortality rate of 8%. Logistic regression analysis for 30 day mortality showed a significant increase as the zones ascended (P = .007). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 5-year survival significantly deteriorated as the zones ascended (P = .039), with no significant difference in the freedom from reintervention curves between zones (P = .37).\nWe have shown that the extent of the aneurysm repair as determined by the proximal sealing zone is associated with outcome. Mortality, operative duration, blood loss, and hospital stay all significantly increased as the zones ascended. These data also validate the use of the proposed new classification based on aortic anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Isolated iliac artery aneurysms are rare, but potentially fatal. The effect of recent trends in the use of endovascular iliac aneurysm repair (EVIR) on isolated iliac artery aneurysm-associated mortality is unknown.\nWe identified all patients with a primary diagnosis of iliac artery aneurysm in the National Inpatient Sample from 1988 to 2011. We examined trends in management (open vs EVIR, elective and urgent) and overall isolated iliac artery aneurysm-related deaths (with or without repair). We compared in-hospital mortality and complications for the subgroup of patients undergoing elective open and EVIR from 2000 to 2011.\nWe identified 33,161 patients undergoing isolated iliac artery aneurysm repair from 1988 to 2011, of which there were 9016 EVIR and 4933 open elective repairs from 2000 to 2011. Total repairs increased after the introduction of EVIR, from 28 to 71 per 10 million United States (U.S.) population (P < .001). EVIR surpassed open repair in 2003. Total isolated iliac artery aneurysm-related deaths, due to rupture or elective repair, decreased after the introduction of EVIR from 4.4 to 2.3 per 10 million U.S. population (P < .001). However, urgent admissions did not decrease during this time period (15 to 15 procedures per 10 million U.S. population; P = .30). Among elective repairs after 2000, EVIR patients were older (72.4 vs 69.4 years; P = .002) and were more likely to have a history of prior myocardial infarction (14.0% vs 11.3%; P < .001) and renal failure (7.2% vs 3.6%; P < .001). Open repair had significantly higher rate of in-hospital mortality (1.8% vs 0.5%; P < .001) and complications (17.9% vs 6.7%; P < .001) and a longer length of stay (6.7 vs 2.3 days; P < .001).\nTreatment of isolated iliac artery aneurysms has increased since the introduction of EVIR and is associated with lower perioperative mortality, despite a higher burden of comorbid illness. Decreasing iliac artery aneurysm-attributable in-hospital deaths are likely related primarily to lower elective mortality with EVIR rather than rupture prevention.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare outcomes after open repair (OR) vs endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nClinical data of consecutive patients treated for asymptomatic AAA between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. Patients were stratified into low/normal-risk (comorbidity score \u2264 10) and high-risk (score > 10) categories. The primary end point was all-cause mortality; secondary end points were complications, reinterventions, conversions, and ruptures. Propensity score-based matching was performed to compare outcomes.\nThere were 1534 patients, of whom 207 were women (13%); 641 (42%) were treated with OR and 893 (58%) with EVAR. After propensity score matching, we selected 558 pairs of OR and EVAR (mean age, 73 \u00b1 7.6 years); 158 were women (14%). The 30-day mortality rate was 1.3% after OR and 0.9% after EVAR (P = .56). In multivariable analysis, only high risk was an independent predictor of early mortality (odds ratio, 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-18; P = .03). The early complication rate was lower for EVAR (13%; odds ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8; P < .001) than for OR (24%). Median follow-up was 7.6 years (31 days-13.1 years). The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 72% after EVAR and 81% after OR (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.73; P < .001). The 5-year survival was not significantly different in matched cohorts operated on after 2005 (77% vs 81%; P = .57). High risk, advanced age, cancer history, AAA size, and EVAR predicted all-cause mortality. Freedom from reintervention was 74% after EVAR and 88% after OR (hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.92-3.51; P < .001). Freedom from rupture was 99.2% after EVAR and 99.8% after OR (P = .04). In multivariable models, female gender was associated with complications; EVAR was associated with reinterventions (P < .05).\nIn this retrospective propensity score-matched study, early mortality was similarly low after both EVAR and OR, significantly different from all except one large randomized controlled trial. EVAR had fewer early complications, but it was associated with late all-cause mortality and reinterventions and had a small but definite risk of late rupture. Significantly increased mortality at 5 years was no longer observed when operations were performed after 2005. High risk, advanced age, cancer history, and AAA size predicted late all-cause mortality. This study failed to confirm early or late survival benefit for EVAR vs OR. Improved surveillance, longer follow-up, and analysis of factors affecting late death in prospective studies are warranted.",

The primary outcome was graft patency. The secondary outcome was limb salvage. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for baseline confounding variables.\nA total of 407 infrainguinal bypasses to below-knee targets were analyzed; 255 patients (63%) received a single-segment GSV, 106 patients (26%) received an AAV, and 46 patients (11%) received a prosthetic conduit.

    "abstract": "Surgeon radiation dose during complex fluoroscopically guided interventions (FGIs) has not been well studied. We sought to characterize radiation exposure to surgeons during FGIs based on procedure type, operator position, level of operator training, upper vs lower body exposure, and addition of protective shielding.\nOptically stimulable, luminescent nanoDot (Landauer, Inc, Glenwood, Ill) detectors were used to measure radiation dose prospectively to surgeons during FGIs. The nanoDot dosimeters were placed outside the lead apron of the primary and assistant operators at the left upper chest and left lower pelvis positions. For each case, the procedure type, the reference air kerma, the kerma-area product, the relative position of the operator, the level of training of the fellow, and the presence or absence of external additional shielding devices were recorded. Three positions were assigned on the right-hand side of the patient in decreasing relative proximity to the flat panel detector (A, B, and C, respectively). Position A (main operator) was closest to the flat panel detector. Position D was on the left side of the patient at the brachial access site. The nanoDots were read using a microSTARii medical dosimetry system (Landauer, Inc) after every procedure. The nanoDot dosimetry system was calibrated for scattered radiation in an endovascular suite with a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable solid-state radiation detector (Piranha T20; RTI Electronics, Fairfield, NJ). Comparative statistical analysis of nanoDot dose levels between categories was performed by analysis of variance with Tukey pairwise comparisons. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.\nThere were 415 nanoDot measurements with the following case distribution: 16 thoracic endovascular aortic repairs/endovascular aneurysm repairs, 18 fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repairs (FEVARs), 13 embolizations, 41 lower extremity interventions, 10 fistulograms, 13 visceral interventions, and 3 cerebrovascular procedures. The mean operator effective dose for FEVARs was higher than for other case types (P < .03), 20 \u03bcSv at position A and 9 \u03bcSv at position B. For all case types, position A (9.0 \u03bcSv) and position D (20 \u03bcSv) received statistically higher effective doses than position B (4 \u03bcSv) or position C (0.4 \u03bcSv) (P < .001). However, the mean operator effective dose for position D was not statistically different from that for position A. The addition of the lead skirt significantly decreased the lower body dose (33 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcSv to 6.3 \u00b1 3.3 \u03bcSv) but not the upper body dose (6.5 \u00b1 3.3 \u03bcSv to 5.7 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcSv). Neither ceiling-mounted shielding nor level of fellow training affected operator dose.\nSurgeon radiation dose during FGIs depends on case type, operator position, and table skirt use but not on the level of fellow training. On the basis of these data, the primary operator could perform approximately 12 FEVARs/wk and have an annual dose <10 mSv, which would not exceed lifetime occupational dose limits during a 35-year career. With practical case loads, operator doses are relatively low and unlikely to exceed occupational limits.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare perioperative and postoperative outcomes after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in patients with various neck morphologic features.\nData from the Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket Registry (ENGAGE) were used for the analyses. Patients were categorized into three different groups according to proximal aortic neck anatomy: regular (REG), intermediate (INT), and challenging (CHA). REG was defined as AAAs with a proximal neck \u226515 mm combined with a suprarenal angulation (\u03b1) \u226445 degrees and an infrarenal neck angulation (\u00df) \u226460 degrees. INT was defined as AAAs with a proximal neck of 10 to 15 mm combined with \u03b1 \u226445 degrees and \u00df \u226460 degrees or with a proximal neck of >15 mm combined with \u03b1 \u226460 degrees and \u00df = 60 to 75 degrees or \u03b1 = 45 to 60 degrees and \u00df \u226475 degrees. CHA was defined as infrarenal necks that exceed at least one of the three defining factors.\nOverall, 925 patients (75.9%) had REG anatomy, 189 patients (15.5%) had INT anatomy, and 104 patients (8.5%) had CHA anatomy. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar. There was a significant difference in AAA diameter between the REG and CHA groups (59.4 mm vs 65.2 mm; P < .001). Technical success was similar among groups (REG 99.1% vs INT 99.5% vs CHA 97.1%). There were no differences in mortality or the need for secondary procedures within 30 days or at 1 year. A significantly higher rate of type I endoleaks within 30 days was seen in CHA compared with REG (adjusted odds ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.46) and INT (adjusted odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.70), but there was no difference at 1-year follow-up.\nThis real-world, global experience shows promising results and indicates that endovascular AAA repair with the Endurant stent graft (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) is safe and effective in patients with challenging aortic neck anatomy. However, long-term follow-up of patients is required to confirm results.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) have led many physicians to embrace a purely percutaneous approach using the suture-mediated \"preclose\" technique. Whereas there are a number of theoretical benefits, the rate of periprocedural iatrogenic acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. We sought to determine the incidence of acute DVT after percutaneous EVAR (PEVAR).\nThis was a single-center, retrospective review of 52 consecutive patients undergoing elective PEVAR. Demographics, procedural data, and postprocedure lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound data were analyzed by univariate statistical analysis.\nAmong the 52 patients, the average age was 73 years, and the majority were men (n = 44). Only 6% (n = 3) had a prior history of DVT. The majority of procedures were performed under general anesthesia (n = 51 [98%]) with systemic intravenous heparin. Protamine was used in only 13 cases (25%). Sheath sizes ranged from 9F to 20F, with an average of 16F, and closure was achieved using the preclose technique. Postprocedure chemoprophylaxis was administered to 85% of patients (n = 44) during their hospitalization. Median length of stay was 1 day. Acute DVT was identified in 8% of patients (n = 4) on postoperative day 1. Among the 4 DVTs, 25% were femoropopliteal (n = 1) and 75% were calf vein DVTs (n = 3). On follow-up imaging 2 weeks later, 75% of DVTs were resolved. Among the four patients with acute DVT on postoperative day 1, three had associated risk factors: history of DVT (n = 2), active smokers (n = 1), and obesity (body mass index >30; n = 3). The remaining patient had no risk factors but developed an ipsilateral calf vein DVT.\nThe risk of acute DVT after PEVAR is low. Lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound screening is not necessary unless there exist preclinical risk factors or postprocedural clinical indications suggestive of DVT.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4-5 and dialysis treatment on incidence of foot ulceration and major lower extremity amputation in comparison to CKD stage 3.\nIn this retrospective study, all individuals who visited our hospital between 2006 and 2012 because of CKD stages 3 to 5 or dialysis treatment were included. Medical records were reviewed for incidence of foot ulceration and major amputation. The time from CKD 3, CKD 4-5, and dialysis treatment until first foot ulceration and first major lower extremity amputation was calculated and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease, peripheral neuropathy, and foot deformities were included for potential confounding.\nA total of 669 individuals were included: 539 in CKD 3, 540 in CKD 4-5, and 259 in dialysis treatment (individuals could progress from one group to the next). Unadjusted foot ulcer incidence rates per 1000 patients per year were 12 for CKD 3, 47 for CKD 4-5, and 104 for dialysis (P < .001). In multivariate analyses, the hazard ratio for incidence of foot ulceration was 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-6.3) in CKD 4-5 and 7.6 (95% CI, 4.8-12.1) in dialysis treatment compared with CKD 3. Hazard ratios for incidence of major amputation were 9.5 (95% CI, 2.1-43.0) and 15 (95% CI, 3.3-71.0), respectively.\nCKD 4-5 and dialysis treatment are independent risk factors for foot ulceration and major amputation compared with CKD 3. Maximum effort is needed in daily clinical practice to prevent foot ulcers and their devastating consequences in all individuals with CKD 4-5 or dialysis treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.\nWe retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.\nVulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.\nOur radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases.",

The survey was then offered to members of the Western Vascular Society. Responses were analyzed by physician practice type. Consensus was defined as at least 70% agreement for a response.\nResponse rate was 40%. The cohort comprised 51% from academic institutions and 94% from metropolitan areas. Patients with rAAA were accepted in transfer by 88% of respondents; a majority accepted transfers from distances of up to 100 miles or more. Most had no formal protocol for transfer or treatment of patients with rAAA. Wide variation was observed regarding local evaluation, clinical status at presentation, pre-existing medical comorbidity and required tests for determining suitability for transfer, and management during transport. Academic physicians were more likely to accept clinically unstable patients and to have capability to offer endovascular aneurysm repair.\nWide variation was observed regarding clinical suitability for transfer, diagnostic criteria and tests before transfer, and essential resources required at the receiving hospital.

    "abstract": "As vascular surgeons strive to meet the Fistula First Initiative, some authors have observed a decrease in arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation rates in association with an increase in AVF creation. In May 2012, we adopted a practice change in an attempt to maintain the same high level of AVF creation while leading to a decrease in fistula failures.\nA retrospective study was conducted of all dialysis access procedures performed by a single vascular surgeon before (period 1; before May 1, 2012) and after (period 2; after May 1, 2012) the change in practice pattern. The adopted change included favoring the brachiocephalic location unless the patient was an ideal anatomic candidate for a radiocephalic AVF, creating a larger and standardized arteriotomy, and using a large venous footplate whenever possible. The main outcome measure was primary functional patency at 1 year. Secondary outcome measures included primary patency at 1 year, time to maturation, type of fistula created, steal syndrome, and tunneled hemodialysis catheter infections.\nOf 213 vascular access procedures performed, 191 (90%) were AVFs. There was no difference in use of AVFs between period 1 (93% AVFs) and period 2 (88% AVFs; P = .2). Use of brachiocephalic AVFs increased from 38% in period 1 to 56% in period 2 (P = .01), with a corresponding trend toward a decrease in radiocephalic AVFs in period 2 (36% in period 1 to 27% in period 2; P = .2). Primary functional patency at 1 year was 47% in period 1 and 63% in period 2 (P = .03). Primary patency at 1 year was 51% in period 1 and 70% in period 2 (P = .001). Time to reach functional maturation was decreased in period 2 (median, 76 vs 82.5 days; P = .046). There was no difference in steal syndrome (P = 1.0), and the incidence of hemodialysis catheter infections was lower in period 2 (0 vs 7 [7%]; P = .006).\nIncreasing brachiocephalic AVF creation and reducing our reliance on radiocephalic AVFs resulted in a significant increase in primary functional patency at 1 year. This was achieved while maintaining the same high percentage of fistulas, a lower rate of central catheter infections, and the same low incidence of steal syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Most patients undergoing elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are classified American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 3. However, the severity of systemic disease among these patients can vary, resulting in markedly different levels of fitness. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that ASA 3 patients with good self-reported exercise tolerance have better survival after EVAR.\nData for EVAR patients classified ASA 3 were extracted retrospectively from a prospectively collected registry database. Patients were split into two groups according to fitness level, based on their self-reported ability to climb stairs or to walk briskly for 1 km. Patient survival for each group was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models.\nDuring follow-up of 392 patients for a mean of 1.9 years, there were 64 deaths (16.3%), 13.4% in the more physically able group and 21.6% in the less able group. Self-reported inability to walk or to climb stairs was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 3.55; P < .0001). Following risk adjustment for a number of possible confounding variables, fitness remained significant (hazard ratio, 3.03; P = .0011).\nThis study has shown that among ASA 3 patients, self-reported exercise capacity is an excellent means of predicting survival. Physicians should consider the physical fitness of their ASA 3 patients when discussing treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Although numerous studies have described the incidence of postoperative cranial nerve injury (CNI) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), there have been few attempts to identify risk factors for this complication.\nThe 2012 CEA-targeted American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to determine the incidence of CNI after CEA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of CNI after CEA, using a comprehensive array of patient-, carotid disease-, and procedure-related factors as potential predictor variables.\nOf the 3762 CEA patients who were included in our analysis, 84 (2.2%) were noted to have sustained CNI in the first 30 days after their operation. Independent predictors of this complication included age \u226580 years (reference group, <70 years; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for CNI, 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-3.03; P = .05), presence of a preoperative bleeding disorder (including patients in whom preoperative nonaspirin anticoagulation therapy was not stopped before CEA; AOR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.68; P = .04), duration of operation (AOR, 1.15 for each 30-minute interval beyond an operative time of 90 minutes; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = .001), and need for reoperation (AOR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.03-6.80; P = .04).\nOur study demonstrates clinically evident CNI to be a relatively uncommon event after CEA at institutions that participate in the CEA-targeted American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and identifies four separate factors that are independently associated with an increased risk of CNI.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is now a mainstay of therapy for abdominal aortic aneurysm, although it remains associated with significant expense. We performed a comprehensive analysis of EVAR delivery at an academic medical center to identify targets for quality improvement and cost reduction in light of impending health care reform.\nAll infrarenal EVARs performed from April 2011 to March 2012 were identified (N = 127). Procedures were included if they met standard commercial instructions for use guidelines, used a single manufacturer, and were billed to Medicare diagnosis-related group 238 (n = 49). By use of DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) quality improvement methodology (define, measure, analyze, improve, control), targets for EVAR quality improvement were identified and high-yield changes were implemented. Procedure technical costs were calculated before and after process redesign.\nPerioperative services and clinic visits were identified as targets for quality improvement efforts and cost reduction. Mean technical costs before the intervention were $31,672, with endograft implants accounting for 52%. Pricing redesign in collaboration with hospital purchasing reduced mean EVAR technical costs to $28,607, a 10% reduction in overall cost, with endograft implants now accounting for 46%. Perioperative implementation of instrument tray redesign reduced instrument use by 32% (184 vs 132 instruments), saving $50,000 annually. Unnecessary clinic visits were reduced by 39% (1.6 vs 1.1 clinic visits per patient) through implementation of a preclinic imaging protocol. There was no difference in mean length of stay after the intervention.\nComprehensive EVAR delivery redesign leads to cost reduction and waste elimination while preserving quality. Future efforts to achieve more competitive and transparent device pricing will make EVAR more cost neutral and enhance its financial sustainability for health care systems.",

Three-dimensional patient-specific dissection geometries were generated from computed tomography angiography and used in CFD simulations of pulsatile blood flow. Hemodynamic parameters including false lumen flow and wall shear stress were compared.\nPatients with rapid aneurysmal degeneration had a growth rate of 5.3 \u00b1 2.7 mm/mo compared with those with stable aortic diameters, who had rates of 0.2 \u00b1 0.02 mm/mo. Groups did not differ in initial aortic diameter (36.1 \u00b1 2.9 vs 34.4 \u00b1 3.6 mm; P = .122) or false lumen size (22.6 \u00b1 2.9 vs 20.2 \u00b1 4.5 mm; P = .224). In patients with rapidly expanding aneurysms, a greater percentage of total flow passed through the false lumen (78.3% \u00b1 9.3% vs 56.3% \u00b1 11.8%; P = .016). The time-averaged wall shear stress on the aortic wall was also significantly higher (12.6 \u00b1 3.7 vs 7.4 \u00b1 2.8 Pa; P = .028).\nHemodynamic parameters derived from CFD simulations of acute type B aortic dissections were significantly different in dissections complicated by aneurysm formation.

We sought to determine the association of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and other patient factors with overall WO, WO due to wound infection, and WO due to sterile dehiscence.\nThe medical records of all patients undergoing MLEA from August 1, 2011, to November 1, 2013, were reviewed. Demographic data, hemoglobin A1c level, albumin concentration, dialysis dependence, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), nasal MRSA colonization, and diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined as variables. The overall WO rate was determined, and the cause of WO was categorized as either a sterile dehiscence or a wound infection.\nEighty-three patients underwent 96 MLEAs during a 27-month period. The rates of overall WO, WO due to infection, and WO due to sterile dehiscence were 39%, 19%, and 19%, respectively (1% developed a traumatic wound). On univariate analysis, PVD, MRSA colonization, DM, and dialysis dependence were all associated with higher rates of overall WO (P < .05). On multivariate analysis, MRSA colonization was associated with higher rates of overall WO (P = .03) and WO due to wound infection (11% vs 45%; P < .01). DM and PVD were associated with higher rates of overall WO and WO due to sterile dehiscence on both univariate and multivariate analysis (P < .05).\nNasal MRSA colonization is associated with higher rates of overall WO and WO due to wound infection. DM and PVD are associated with higher rates of overall WO and WO due to sterile dehiscence but are not associated with WO due to wound infection. Further studies addressing the effect of nasal MRSA eradication on postoperative wound outcomes after MLEA are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The Zenith Alpha thoracic endograft (William Cook Europe, ApS, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) is a new low-profile thoracic endograft that has recently become commercially available in Europe. The reduced profile offers potential benefits and extended applicability, especially in patients with small or diseased iliofemoral vessels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed with the new Zenith Alpha thoracic endograft.\nFrom November 2013 to the present, Zenith Alpha thoracic stent grafts have been employed to treat 42 patients (31 men; median age, 71 years; range, 54-83 years) suffering from descending thoracic aortic disease: 34 degenerative aneurysms, 4 aortic ulcers, 2 false aneurysms following prior thoracic open repair, and 2 traumatic blunt injuries. The mean proximal neck length was 25 mm (range, 17-40 mm), with a mean access vessel diameter of 6.7 mm (range, 6-11 mm). In 11 cases, aortoiliac occlusive disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus type B and C lesions) was present. The proximal landing was in zone 1 in 2 cases, in zone 2 in 25 cases, in zone 3 in 11 cases, and in zone 4 in 4 cases.\nFifty-one endografts (45 proximal components and 6 distal components) were deployed in 42 patients. The endografts were deployed safely and effectively from one surgical femoral access site in all cases. In patients with associated aortoiliac disease, no adjunctive procedures for device insertion, except for predilation with balloon angioplasty in two cases, were required. No major complications related to the devices were observed in any of the patients during the postoperative course, and there was no perioperative mortality, paraparesis, or paraplegia. At 30 days, morbid events included one case of major stroke, two cases of transient acute renal failure, and one case of postimplantation syndrome. No access-related complications were recorded. Computed tomography performed within 6 months was obtained in 39 patients and confirmed 100% clinical success without device-related complications. No type I endoleaks or bird's beak effects were documented.\nOur early experience shows that deployment of the new Zenith Alpha endograft from a surgical femoral access is safe and effective in treating thoracic aortic aneurysms, aortic ulcers, and traumatic blunt injuries, even in patients with small or diseased access vessels. Endograft conformance to the aorta and exclusion of the aneurysm were satisfactory. Long-term durability remains to be evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The addition of local ultrasound (US) with a contrast agent to standard intra-arterial thrombolysis can accelerate the thrombolytic treatment of stroke and myocardial infarction. The contrast agent consists of microsized gas-filled bubbles that collapse when exposed to US, causing destabilization of the clot and making the clot surface more susceptible to fibrinolytics. In this study, we investigated the effect of additional US and microbubbles on standard low-dose intra-arterial thrombolysis in a porcine model of extensive peripheral arterial occlusion.\nExtensive arterial thrombosis was induced in 10 pigs in the 4-cm external iliac artery by clamping and injection of 100 IU of bovine thrombin. A transcutaneous laser Doppler flow probe and an ultrasonic perivascular flow probe assessed microcirculation and arterial flow respectively. The urokinase-only (UK) group (n = 4) received standard thrombolytic therapy: intra-arterial bolus injection of 500,000 IU, followed by a continuous low-dose urokinase (50,000 IU/h) infusion through an intra-arterial catheter and local intermittent application of US, 1 second on, 5 seconds off, to visualize vascular patency during the first hour of therapy and to ensure microbubbles replenished the proximal portion of the occluded artery. The urokinase plus microbubbles (UK+) group (n = 6) received the same urokinase therapy with a concomitant intravenous infusion of microbubbles and local intermittent application of US. The contrast infusion protocol consisted of a bolus of two vials of 5 mL in the first 15 minutes and then three times 5 mL slowly hand-injected continuously during the next 45 min. After 3 hours of therapy, the animals were euthanized, and thrombi were harvested and weighed. All organs were cut in thin slices and macroscopically inspected for potential (hemorrhagic) adverse events, and tissue samples were taken.\nMedian thrombus weights were 1.1 g (range, 0.8-1.3 g) in the UK+ group vs 1.6 g (range, 1.3-1.9 g) in the UK group (P = .01). Arterial blood flow increased in four of six pigs in the UK+ group by a mean 61% vs in one of four in the UK group, with 1%. Microcirculation and lower limb arterial pressure levels improved after the start of therapy in the UK+ group, contrary to a trend of decline in the UK group. No signs of bleeding complications were observed in either group.\nIn this experimental pilot study, the addition of contrast-enhanced US accelerated the thrombolytic effect of low-dose intra-arterial thrombolysis in peripheral arterial occlusions. Further clinical studies are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms leading to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of Sonic Hedgehog (SHh), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and Notch signaling components in human aneurysmal and nonaneurysmal aorta in vivo.\nPaired tissue samples were obtained from aneurysmal and nonaneurysmal (control) segments of the aortic wall of eight patients with suitable anatomy undergoing open repair of infrarenal AAAs. Protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were determined by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis.\nAneurysm development resulted in a significant reduction in vascular smooth muscle (vSMC) differentiation genes \u03b1-actin and SMC22\u03b1 at both mRNA and protein levels. In parallel experiments, an 80.0% \u00b1 15% reduction in SHh protein expression was observed in aneurysmal tissue compared with control. SHh and Ptc-1 mRNA levels were also significantly decreased, by 82.0% \u00b1 10% and 75.0% \u00b1 5%, respectively, in aneurysmal tissue compared with nonaneurysmal control tissue. Similarly, there was a 50.0% \u00b1 9% and 60.0% \u00b1 4% reduction in Notch receptor 1 intracellular domain and Hrt-2 protein expression, respectively, in addition to significant reductions in Notch 1, Notch ligand Delta like 4, and Hrt-2 mRNA expression in aneurysmal tissue compared with nonaneurysmal tissue. There was no change in Hrt-1 expression observed in aneurysmal tissue compared with control. In parallel experiments, we found a 2.2 \u00b1 0.2-fold and a 5.6 \u00b1 2.2-fold increase in TGF-\u03b2 mRNA and protein expression, respectively, in aneurysmal tissue compared with nonaneurysmal tissue. In vitro, Hedgehog signaling inhibition with cyclopamine in human aortic SMCs resulted in decreased Hedgehog/Notch signaling component and vSMC differentiation gene expression. Moreover, cyclopamine significantly increased TGF-\u03b21 mRNA expression by 2.6 \u00b1 0.9-fold.\nThese results suggest that SHh/Notch and TGF-\u03b2 signaling are differentially regulated in aneurysmal tissue compared with nonaneurysmal tissue. Changes in these signaling pathways and the resulting changes in vSMC content may play a causative role in the development of AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Age and gender are two factors that determine the risk of atherosclerosis. The latter effect is only partly understood. Dicarbonyls, in particular methylglyoxal, participate in the development of atherosclerosis, and their major detoxification route is the enzyme glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), which is known to decrease during aging.\nGLO1 expression and activity were studied in atherosclerotic carotid artery lesions of 71 patients with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics.\nGLO1 activity was nonsignificantly reduced by >50% in individuals with carotid artery disease compared with control individuals. There was no significant difference in GLO1 expression between the groups; however, the GLO1 activity-to-protein ratio showed a significant reduction for the carotid artery disease patients compared with the controls. The reduction in the GLO1 activity-to-protein ratio was more pronounced in men and was associated with increased inflammation shown by a significant elevation in the expression-level of interleukin-1\u03b2.\nThese data suggest that GLO1 is regulated on the post-translational level by factors such as gender as well as factors that affect the overall burden of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms of the internal mammary artery are rare. We describe a case of a 49-year-old woman with a SMAD3 mutation who presented with left internal mammary artery aneurysm that was thought to have ruptured, causing a large spontaneous left mediastinal hematoma. The aneurysm was treated successfully months after initial presentation with coil embolization. SMAD3 mutations are linked to familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, peripheral aneurysms, and early-onset osteoarthritis, with an estimated incidence of 2% in families with familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to link a SMAD3 mutation with internal mammary artery aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Conventional catheter manipulation in the arch and supra-aortic trunks carries a risk of cerebral embolization. This study proposes a platform for detailed quantitative analysis of contact forces (CF) exerted on the vasculature, in order to investigate the potential advantages of robotic navigation.\nAn anthropomorphic phantom representing a type I bovine arch was mounted and coupled onto a force/torque sensor. Three-axis force readings provided an average root-mean-square modulus, indicating the total forces exerted on the phantom. Each of the left subclavian, left common carotid, and right common carotid arteries was cannulated within a simulated endovascular suite with conventional (n\u00a0= 42) vs robotic techniques (n\u00a0= 30) by two operator groups: experts and novices. The procedure path was divided into three phases, and performance metrics corresponding to mean and maximum forces, force impact over time, standard deviation of forces, and number of significant catheter contacts with the arterial wall were extracted.\nOverall, median CF were reduced from 1.20\u00a0N (interquartile range [IQR], 0.98-1.56\u00a0N) to 0.31\u00a0N (IQR, 0.26-0.40\u00a0N; P\u00a0< .001) for the right common carotid artery; 1.59\u00a0N (IQR, 1.11-1.85\u00a0N) to 0.33\u00a0N (IQR, 0.29-0.43\u00a0N; P\u00a0< .001) for the left common carotid artery; and 0.84\u00a0N (IQR, 0.47-1.08\u00a0N) to 0.10\u00a0N (IQR, 0.07-0.17\u00a0N; P\u00a0< .001) for the left subclavian artery. Robotic navigation resulted in significant reductions for the mean and maximum forces for each procedural phase. Significant improvements were also seen in other metrics, particularly at the target vessel ostium and for the more anatomically challenging procedural phases. Force reductions using robotic technology were evident for both novice and expert groups.\nRobotic navigation can potentially reduce CF and catheter-tissue contact points in an in\u00a0vitro model, by enhancing catheter stability and control during endovascular manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) has been defined as rest pain or tissue loss in patients who have an ankle-brachial index (ABI) \u22640.50, ankle pressure (AP) <70 mm Hg, or toe pressure (TP) <50 mm Hg. Data suggesting that these patients are at high risk for limb loss without successful revascularization are limited. This study was designed to identify limb loss and mortality rates in patients who did not respond to revascularization or who were not revascularized to determine whether CLI hemodynamic criteria accurately identify patients at high risk for limb loss.\nBetween 2008 and 2010, all patients undergoing lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound testing at our hospital were identified. Those with ABI <0.50, AP <70 mm Hg, or TP <50 mm Hg were retrospectively reviewed to determine whether they had symptoms of rest pain, ischemic ulceration, or gangrene qualifying them for analysis in the database. Patients who underwent revascularization and subsequently had postrevascularization ABI, AP, or TP greater than the CLI criteria were removed from the cohort. Demographic factors, wound healing, amputation rates, and mortality were obtained and analyzed in relation to the initial APs and TPs. Outcomes were measured by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.\nIn 381 patients identified in the study, 443 limbs met CLI criteria. After revascularization, 98 limbs with ABI or TP that improved to >0.5 and >50 mm Hg, respectively, were removed from the study cohort. In 45 limbs, patients did not respond to initial revascularization as their ABI, AP, or TP remained within CLI criteria. These limbs remained in the patient cohort, yielding a final group of 296 patients and 345 limbs. Mean follow-up was 2 years. In the entire patient cohort, limb loss occurred in 24% at 1 year and in 31% at 3 years. Mortality was 32% at 1 year and 56% at 3 years. Amputation-free survival was 54% at 1 year and 28% at 3 years. Lower TPs were associated with a statistically higher incidence of amputation. Among those with an initial TP \u226410 mm Hg (n = 85), limb loss occurred in 46% at 1 year and 60% at 3 years. This limb loss was significantly greater than limb loss among those with a TP of 31 to 50 mm Hg (n = 115; 18% at 3 years; P < .001) Amputation-free survival in patients with a TP \u226410 mm Hg was 8% at 3 years.\nCLI is associated with a high mortality, but not all patients with currently defined hemodynamic criteria for CLI are at high risk of limb loss. Patients with a TP between 31 and 50 mm Hg (41% of the cohort) and not receiving revascularization or not responding hemodynamically to revascularization experienced a low risk of limb loss. We recommend revising the hemodynamic criteria for CLI to better identify patients at high risk for limb loss who require intervention to improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Carotid intervention shortly after an acute neurologic ischemic event is being performed more frequently in stroke centers to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is offered to select patients with ischemic stroke symptoms who present within 4.5 hours. However, there is a paucity of data as to whether tPA followed by urgent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) has an increased risk of complications, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We sought to determine the periprocedural complications of urgently performed CEA or CAS following tPA.\nFrom January 2009 to January 2015, 762 patients underwent carotid interventions (CEA, n = 440; CAS, n = 322) at a tertiary referral center and 165 patients (21.6%) underwent an urgent CEA or CAS during the index hospitalization for an acute transient ischemic attack or stroke. We compared the effect of intravenous tPA on 30-day complications, including ICH. The \u03c7(2) and Fisher exact tests were used to determine significance between groups.\nDuring the 6-year period, 165 patients underwent urgent carotid interventions (CEA, n = 135; CAS, n = 30) for acute neurologic symptoms. Of these, 19% (31 patients [CEA, n = 25; CAS, n = 6]) had tPA for an acute stroke; the remaining (134 patients [CEA, n = 110; CAS, n = 24]) fell outside of the tPA time window. Most strokes were minor or moderate with a mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 6.6 (range, 0-19). The mean time to intervention for both groups was 2.4 days (0-15 days). The 30-day stroke, death, and myocardial infarction rates were 9.7% (3 of 31) for the tPA group compared with 4.5% (6 of 134) for the no-tPA group (P = .37). Including bleeding complications in these 30-day outcomes, there was no difference between the tPA (3 of 31) and the no-tPA cohorts (8 of 134; P = .43). In the tPA group, there were one ICH, one neck hematoma/death, and an additional death; in the no-tPA group, there were one ICH, two neck hematomas, one stroke, two myocardial infarctions, one ICH/death, and one additional death. No significant increased rates of bleeding were noted within the tPA group (2 of 31) compared with the no-tPA group (4 of 134; P = .32). Moreover, in the tPA cohort, more than half of the patients (17 of 31) underwent revascularization within 72 hours (CEA = 13; CAS = 4) with outcomes similar to those who underwent revascularization after 72 hours.\nThrombolysis followed by urgent CEA or CAS is not associated with an increased risk of complications in select patients who present with acute neurologic symptoms. Selection of patients is important; there was no ICH and only one death in each group for patients with minor to moderate ischemic stroke (NIHSS score <10).",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, primary endoluminal therapy for critical limb ischemia (CLI), assessed as rest pain and tissue loss of the lower extremity, has significantly increased. Reporting of patient-centered outcomes using the new Society for Vascular Surgery objective performance goals (OPGs) has been limited. This study examined the OPGs for infrainguinal endovascular management of CLI.\nA prospective database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the lower extremity for CLI between 2000 and 2011 was queried. Evaluated were clinical efficacy (absence of recurrent symptoms, maintenance of ambulation and absence of major amputation), amputation-free survival (survival without major amputation), and freedom from major adverse limb events (MALEs; above-ankle amputation of the index limb or major reintervention - new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision).\nA total of 728 patients (60% male; age, 68 \u00b1 14 years) underwent lower extremity interventions for CLI (66% tissue loss); of these, 39% had superficial femoral artery and tibial interventions. Diabetes mellitus was present in 71%, hyperlipidemia in 64%, and chronic renal insufficiency in 37%. Technical success was 96%. The overall rate at 30 days of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) was 3% and MALEs was 12%. At 5 years, clinical efficacy was (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean) 42% \u00b1 5%, amputation-free survival was 41% \u00b1 7%, and freedom from MALEs was 51% \u00b1 4%. Clinical efficacy was significantly different in those presenting with rest pain and tissue loss and in the anatomic high-risk group compared with the clinical high-risk group, and both were worse compared with the group without clinical or high-risk criteria.\nEndoluminal therapy for CLI is associated with early low MACE rates but high MALE rates. When the key outcome of amputation free survival is considered, predictors of a better outcome were absence of current smoking, a lower modified Edifoligide for the Prevention of Infrainguinal Vein Graft Failure (PREVENT III) amputation risk score, better preoperative ambulation status, lower MACEs, and discharge disposition to home. The presence of tissue loss and anatomic risk factors negatively affect outcomes. Longer-term outcomes after endovascular intervention for CLI remain relatively poor, with <40% success in objective performance outcomes at 5 years.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) may rupture at smaller diameters in women than in men, and women may be at higher risk and have poorer outcomes in elective and emergent interventions because of age and comorbidities. Practice guidelines recommending elective AAA repair at >5.5 cm are gender neutral and may not adequately reflect increased risks in women or the potential advantages of elective lower risk endovascular procedures.\nPatients with a diagnosis of AAA discharged from a single referral hospital during a 14-year period were identified for retrospective analysis.\nA total of 2121 patients with AAAs were studied, 499 women (23.5%) and 1622 men (76.5%). Women were older and had a greater incidence of hypertension, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyslipidemia, and renal insufficiency.

No differences in mortality with respect to OAR or EVAR were found between the female and male cohorts in either intact or ruptured AAAs.\nWomen with AAAs are older and have a higher frequency of cardiovascular risk factors than men. Women rupture AAAs with a greater frequency than men at all size intervals and have a fourfold increased frequency of rupture at <5.5 cm. No differences in surgical mortality between women and men were found. Current practice guidelines for elective AAA operative intervention should be reconsidered and stratified by gender.",

    "abstract": "The benefit of carotid surgery in asymptomatic patients with high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) is subject of intense debate, and thus improved preoperative risk stratification is mandatory. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of contralateral ICAS (cl-ICAS) for the preoperative clinical presentation of patients with ipsilateral ICAS (primary outcome).\nThis study was a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort comprising 485 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for high-grade ICAS. Patients were classified by their clinical presentation, ie, asymptomatic (n = 213) or symptomatic (within 6 months of surgery; n = 272, comprising both transient ischemic attack [TIA; n = 163] and stroke [n = 109]). We investigated the association of cl-ICAS with the primary outcome in adjusted regression models.\nMean ipsilateral degrees of ICAS were similar in both groups (84% \u00b1 10% vs 84% \u00b1 11%; P = .92), whereas contralateral degrees were significantly higher in the symptomatic group (29% \u00b1 34% vs 38% \u00b1 39%; P = .008). After multivariable regression analysis, cl-ICAS >60% conferred a three times higher preoperative stroke risk (odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.98-5.54; P < .001). Inclusion of cl-ICAS significantly improved (P = .001) ipsilateral combined TIA and stroke risk prediction based on established risk factors (area under the curve, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.72; P < .001).\nOur study identifies a high contralateral degree of ICAS as an independent predictor of preoperative ipsilateral TIA and stroke in patients with ipsilateral high-grade ICAS. Therefore, such patients might rather benefit from elective carotid surgery and intensive postoperative medical care.",

    "abstract": "Medical management with antiplatelet (AP) and statin therapy is recommended for nearly all patients undergoing vascular surgery to reduce cardiovascular events. We assessed the association between preoperative use of AP and statin medications and postoperative in-hospital myocardial infarction (MI) in patients undergoing high-risk open surgery.\nWe studied patients who underwent elective suprainguinal (n = 3039) and infrainguinal (n = 8323) bypass and open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 3007) in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI, 2005-2014). We assessed the association between AP or statin use and in-hospital postoperative MI and MI/death. Multivariable logistic analyses were performed to identify the patient, procedure, and preoperative medication factors associated with postoperative MI and MI/death across procedures and patient cardiac risk strata. Secondary end points included bleeding, transfusion, and thrombotic complications.\nMost patients were taking both AP and statin preoperatively (56% both agents vs 19% AP only, 13% statin only, and 12% neither agent). Use of both agents was more common for patients in the highest cardiac risk stratum (low, 54%; intermediate, 59%; high, 61%; P < .01). Increased cardiac risk was associated with higher MI rates (1.8% vs 3.8% vs 6.5% for low, intermediate, and high risk; P < .01). By univariate analysis, MI rate was paradoxically higher for patients taking both agents (3.7%, vs statin only 2.8%, AP only 2.6%, or neither AP nor statin 2.4%; P = .003). After multivariable adjustment, rates of MI in patients taking preoperative AP only (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.2) and statin only (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-1.2) were not different from those in patients taking either or neither medication (neither agent compared with taking both agents: OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4; P > .05 for all). Similarly, rates of MI/death were not associated with medication status after multivariable adjustment. Estimated blood loss >1 liter (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.7; P < .01) and transfusions of 1 or 2 units (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.0-3.3; P < .01) and \u22653 units (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.1-5.3; P < .01) were highly associated with MI, with similar findings related to composite MI/death in multivariable analysis. Rates of blood loss were slightly higher with AP use for all procedures; however, increased transfusions occurred only for infrainguinal bypass with AP use. Rates of reoperation for bleeding, graft thrombosis, or graft revision did not differ by preoperative AP use.\nPreoperative AP and statin medications as used in VQI were not associated with the rate of in-hospital MI/death after major open vascular operations. Rather, predicted cardiac risk and operative blood loss were significantly associated with in-hospital MI or MI/death. AP and statin medications appear to be more useful in reducing late mortality than early postoperative MI/death in VQI. However, they were not harmful, so their long-term benefit argues for continued use.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the existing evidence about various nonrevascularization-based therapies used to treat patients with severe or critical limb ischemia (CLI) who are not candidates for surgical revascularization.\nWe systematically searched multiple databases through November 2014 for controlled randomized and nonrandomized studies comparing the effect of medical therapies (prostaglandin E1 and angiogenic growth factors) and devices (pumps and spinal cord stimulators). We report odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the outcomes of interest pooling data across studies using the random effects model.\nWe included 19 studies that enrolled 2779 patients. None of the nonrevascularization-based treatments were associated with a significant effect on mortality. Intermittent pneumatic compression (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.55) and spinal cord stimulators (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.79) were associated with reduced risk of amputation. A priori established subgroup analyses (combined vs single therapy; randomized vs nonrandomized) were not statistically significant.\nVery low-quality evidence, mainly due to imprecision and increased risk of bias, suggests that intermittent pneumatic compression and spinal cord stimulators may reduce the risk of amputations. Evidence supporting other medical therapies is insufficient.",

    "abstract": "Aortic neck dilation has been reported after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with self-expanding devices. With a core laboratory analysis of morphologic changes, this study evaluated midterm results of aortic neck evolution after EVAR by endograft with no chronic outward force.\nThis was a multicenter registry of all patients undergoing EVAR with the Ovation endograft (TriVascular, Santa Rosa, Calif). Inclusion criteria were at least 24 months of follow-up. Standard computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed centrally using a dedicated software with multiplanar and volume reconstructions. Proximal aortic neck was segmented into zone A (suprarenal aorta/fixation area), zone B (infrarenal aorta, from lowest renal artery to the first polymer-filled ring), and zone C (infrarenal aorta, at level of the first polymer-filled ring/sealing zone). Images were analyzed for neck enlargement (\u22652 mm), graft migration (\u22653 mm), endoleak, barb detachment, neck bulging, and patency of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric and renal arteries.\nInclusion criteria were met in 161 patients (mean age, 75.2 years; 92% male). During a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range, 24-50), 17 patients died (no abdominal aortic aneurysm-related death). Primary clinical success at 2 years was 95.1% (defined as absence of aneurysm-related death, type I or type III endoleak, graft infection or thrombosis, aneurysm expansion >5 mm, aneurysm rupture, or conversion to open repair). Assisted primary clinical success was 100%. CT scan images at a minimum follow-up of 2 years were available in 89 cases. Patency of visceral arteries at the level of suprarenal fixation (zone A) was 100%. Neither graft migration nor barb detachment or neck bulging was observed. None of the patients had significant neck enlargement. The mean change in the diameter was 0.18 \u00b1 0.22 mm at zone A, -0.32 \u00b1 0.87 mm at zone B, and -0.06 \u00b1 0.97 mm at zone C. Changes at zone B correlated significantly with changes at zone C (correlation coefficient, 0.183; P = .05), whereas no correlation was found with zone A (correlation coefficient, 0.000; P = 1.0).\nNo aortic neck dilation occurred in this series at CT scan after a minimum 24-month follow-up. This may suggest that aortic neck evolution is not associated with EVAR at midterm follow-up when an endograft with no chronic outward radial force is implanted.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Because most patients with CLI will eventually undergo some type of revascularization, the natural history of CLI is not well defined, although it is important to know when patients decide to pursue treatment.\nWe systematically searched multiple databases for controlled and uncontrolled studies of patients with CLI who did not receive revascularization with a minimum follow-up of \u22651 year. Predefined outcomes of interest were mortality, major amputation, and wound healing. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool cumulative incidence across studies.\nWe identified 13 studies enrolling 1527 patients. During a median follow-up of 12 months, all-cause mortality rate was 22% (confidence interval [CI], 12%-33%) and major amputation rate was 22% (CI, 2%-42%). Worsened wound or ulcer was found at 35% (CI, 10%-62%). There was a trend toward improvement in mortality and amputation rate in studies done after 1997. The quality of evidence was low because of increased risk of bias and inconsistency.\nMortality and major amputations are common in patients who have untreated CLI during a median follow-up of 1 year, although these outcomes have improved in recent times.",

    "abstract": "We compared the outcomes and the durability of endovascular recanalization (EVR) with the Viabahn (W.\u00a0L.\u00a0Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) covered stent graft vs traditional aortobifemoral or aortofemoral bypass grafting for complex aortoiliac occlusions.\nBetween 2008 and 2014, 11 unilateral iliac occlusions and 11 aortobiiliac occlusions were treated by EVR. Also collected were data from the last 21 consecutive patients treated in the same period by aortofemoral (n\u00a0= 6) or aortobifemoral (n\u00a0= 15) bypass grafting. In accordance with the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II (TASC II) document, only patients with type D lesions were considered. Kaplan-Meier estimates for patency were calculated, and Cox proportional hazard modeling was performed.\nThe difference in risk factors between the groups was not significant. General anesthesia was required in 100% of the surgical group, and local or locoregional anesthesia was used for EVR. Suprarenal aortic cross-clamping was required in nine of the open surgical procedures (41%). A brachial percutaneous approach was performed in all patients undergoing EVR, and technical success was 100% in both groups. All of the attempts at EVR were successful. At the 2-year follow-up, primary patency did not differ significantly between the endovascular (91%) and surgical (95%) groups. This was seen in the univariate model (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-2.95; P\u00a0= .28) and in the multivariate model (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.06-10.07; P\u00a0= .84) for group (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.04-7.72; P\u00a0= .68), age (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73-1.08; P\u00a0= .24), symptoms (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.42-9.46; P\u00a0= .39), and occlusion (HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 0.51-20.35; P\u00a0= .21). The average hospital length of stay was shorter for patients treated with ERV than for those treated with open surgery (3.9\u00a0\u00b1 2.2 vs 5.8\u00a0\u00b1 3.1\u00a0days, respectively; P\u00a0= .03). The complication rate was 4% for EVR vs 18% in the surgical group (P\u00a0= .32).\nAt 2\u00a0years of follow-up, the results of endoluminal bypass grafting with the Viabahn stent to treat complex aortoiliac disease are promising. Longer-term results are needed to fully evaluate the potential benefits and longer-term patency.",

General anesthesia was required in 100% of the surgical group, and local or locoregional anesthesia was used for EVR.

A brachial percutaneous approach was performed in all patients undergoing EVR, and technical success was 100% in both groups. All of the attempts at EVR were successful. At the 2-year follow-up, primary patency did not differ significantly between the endovascular (91%) and surgical (95%) groups.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to report 30-day results from a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith Alpha thoracic endovascular graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) for treatment of blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs).\nEligible patients with BTAIs (grade II to grade IV) in the descending thoracic aorta were treated with the Zenith Alpha device, which is available in smaller graft diameters (starting at 18 mm) and lower profile delivery systems (starting at 16F) than currently available thoracic endografts. The device (nitinol stents and polyester graft material) accommodates a tighter aortic curvature (radius of 20 mm) than the predicate Zenith TX2 Pro-Form. Follow-up clinical and imaging evaluations were performed at 30 days, at 6 and 12 months, and annually thereafter through 5 years. The primary end point was 30-day mortality.\nBetween January 2013 and May 2014, 50 patients (44 men; mean age, 43 \u00b1 19 years; range, 18-89 years) were treated with the Zenith Alpha device at 17 U.S. sites. The mean Injury Severity Score was 31 \u00b1 14 (range, 3-66). Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients, with 0% intraoperative mortality. Device access was entirely percutaneous in 22 patients (44%). Smaller size grafts (18-24 mm) were used in 15 patients (30%). The mean procedure time was 85 \u00b1 44 minutes (range, 34-278 minutes), and mean blood loss was 103 \u00b1 145 mL (range, 0-1000 mL). The 30-day mortality rate was 2%; one patient died 24 days after the procedure of respiratory failure related to associated injuries and not to the device or procedure as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). One patient experienced a stroke 7 days after the procedure (cause undetermined by the CEC), and one patient underwent reintervention for a site-reported proximal type I endoleak (core laboratory reported unknown endoleak type) at 30 days after the procedure. There have been no conversions to open surgical repair, paraplegia, or aortic rupture within 30 days.\nShort-term results indicate that the Zenith Alpha thoracic endovascular graft appears safe and effective for the treatment of BTAIs. This low-profile device enables complete percutaneous repair in a large percentage of patients and can achieve high rates of technical success and very low rates of aortic injury-related mortality within 30 days.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to present open surgical conversion with graft salvage or \"semiconversion\" as a definitive and safe treatment for untreatable and persistent type II endoleaks causing sac enlargement after endovascular aneurysm repair.\nBetween January 2001 and December 2014, 25 of 1623 endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) patients were selected as candidates for open semiconversion. The indication was persistent type II endoleak in 13 patients (12 of whom received previous attempts of embolization), type I and II endoleak in 2 patients, and sac growth without imaging evidence of endoleak in the other 10. After the infrarenal aorta was prepared (via a retroperitoneal access, whenever possible), the technique consisted of performing a banding of the neck with Teflon (DuPont, Wilmington, Del), a sacotomy to remove the thrombus or the hygroma, or both, and then suturing all of the feeding vessels that were found. Proximal and distal fenestrations were performed to avoid sac repressurization.\nThe semiconversion was performed after a mean of 74 months after the initial EVAR. The mean aneurysm size at the time of the EVAR was 6.0 cm (range, 5.0-9.5 cm), and the mean aneurysm size at the time of the semiconversion was 7.7 cm (range, 5.5-11.5 cm). The overall aneurysm size increase was 38%, and the average growth rate was 8.2% per year. One patient had a stable aneurysm size but was treated because of an emergency condition. Technical success was 100%, with resolution of the endoleak and no perioperative deaths. Four cardiac deaths were registered at 12, 26, 30, and 60 months (mean follow-up, 42 months; range, 1-80 months).\nGraft salvage appears to be a valid option compared with open repair when considering treatment of persistent type II endoleak. This case series shows that semiconversion is a safe and effective treatment for otherwise untreatable type II endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Isolated renal artery aneurysms are rare, and controversy remains about indications for surgical repair. Little is known about the impact of endovascular therapy on selection of patients and outcomes of renal artery aneurysms.\nWe identified all patients undergoing open or endovascular repair of isolated renal artery aneurysms in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988 to 2011 for epidemiologic analysis. Elective cases were selected from the period 2000 to 2011 to create comparable cohorts for outcome comparison. We identified all patients with a primary diagnosis of renal artery aneurysms undergoing open surgery (reconstruction or nephrectomy) or endovascular repair (coil or stent). Patients with concomitant aortic aneurysms or dissections were excluded. We evaluated patient characteristics, management, and in-hospital outcomes for open and endovascular repair, and we examined changes in management and outcomes over time.\nWe identified 6234 renal artery aneurysm repairs between 1988 and 2011. Total repairs increased after the introduction of endovascular repair (8.4 in 1988 to 13.8 in 2011 per 10 million U.S. population; P = .03). Endovascular repair increased from 0 in 1988 to 6.4 in 2011 per 10 million U.S. population (P < .0001). However, there was no concomitant decrease in open surgery (5.5 in 1988 to 7.4 in 2011 per 10 million U.S. population; P = .28). From 2000 to 2011, there were 1627 open and 1082 endovascular elective repairs. Patients undergoing endovascular repair were more likely to have a history of coronary artery disease (18% vs 11%; P < .001), prior myocardial infarction (5.2% vs 1.8%; P < .001), and renal failure (7.7% vs 3.3%; P < .001). In-hospital mortality was 1.8% for endovascular repair, 0.9% for open reconstruction (P = .037), and 5.4% for nephrectomy (P < .001 compared with all revascularization). Complication rates were 12.4% for open repair vs 10.5% for endovascular repair (P = .134), including more cardiac (2.2% vs 0.6%; P = .001) and peripheral vascular complications (0.6% vs 0.0%; P = .014) with open repair. Open repair had a longer length of stay (6.0 vs 4.6 days; P < .001). After adjustment for other predictors of mortality, including age (odds ratio [OR], 1.05 per decade; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.1; P = .001), heart failure (OR, 7.0; 95% CI, 3.1-16.0; P < .001), and dysrhythmia (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.0-16.8; P = .005), endovascular repair was still not protective (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-3.2; P = .145).\nMore renal artery aneurysms are being treated with the advent of endovascular techniques, without a reduction in operative mortality or a reduction in open surgery. Indications for repair of renal artery aneurysms should be re-evaluated.",

Based on the indication, details of the procedure, and complications developed, data were categorized and a systematic review was done to evaluate any significant differences.\nA total of 394 patients (median age, 48.5 years) from 124 papers were included in the study; 31% of the study population was male and 69% was female. Indication for interruption was OBG related in 53.3%, vascular surgery related in 25.1%, oncology related in 17.5%, and trauma related in 4.1% of patients. Overall ischemic complication rate was 22.6%, comprising buttock claudication in 12.2%, buttock necrosis in 4.8%, erectile dysfunction in 2.7%, spinal cord ischemia in 4.0%, colonic ischemia in 2.5%, and bladder necrosis in 0.8%. Complications were fewer in patients younger than the median age of 48.5 years (12.8%) compared with those older than the median age (36.3%; P < .01), women compared with men (13.1% vs 41.7%; P < .01), OBG patients compared with vascular surgery patients (9.5% vs 37.4%; P < .01), patients after ligation compared with embolization (9.4% vs 31.0%; P < .01), and proximal interruption compared with distal interruption (19.6% vs 51.4%; P < .01). No significant difference in complications was seen after bilateral interruption compared with unilateral interruption (20.6% vs 27.1%; P > .05). Similarly, no significant difference in complication rate was seen with the type of embolization material used. Among OBG patients, ligations resulted in fewer complications compared with embolization (4.1% vs 16.7%; P < .01). Among vascular surgery patients, bilateral embolization resulted in a higher rate of complications compared with bilateral ligation (83.3% vs 30.5%; P < .01). Among oncology patients, fewer complications were seen after proximal interruption compared with distal interruption (25.5% vs 75%; P = .01). No significant differences in outcome were seen with regard to gender, laterality, and material used for embolization when patients were compared within each specialty.\nInterruption of the hypogastric artery is relatively safe in young and OBG patients compared with vascular surgery and oncology patients. Ligation of the hypogastric arteries is preferred to embolization, and proximal embolization should be preferred to distal embolization to decrease the risk of ischemic complications. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample size are needed to definitively elucidate clear risk factors for development of complications after hypogastric artery interruption.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel surgical technique to facilitate the second-stage elevation of the basilic or brachial vein in patients with first-stage brachial-basilic or autogenous brachial-brachial arteriovenous fistula by axial splitting of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (MABCN). Filaments of the MABCN typically traverse the anterior aspect of the basilic and brachial veins. The second-stage elevation/shelf superficialization of the basilic or brachial vein, so as not to cause an injury to the MABCN, requires division of these veins with transposition over the nerve branches and subsequent reanastomosis. Our method of axial splitting of the MABCN enables elevation and shelf superficialization of the basilic or brachial vein without the division and reanastomosis of the vein. Twenty-eight patients underwent this simplified elevation. The nerve perineurium was incised longitudinally, nerve fibers were divided intrafascicularly, and cutaneous nerve branches were retracted aside. The vein was elevated between the divided nerves. On discharge and at 1-month follow-up, only one patient complained of localized patch hypoesthesia as reported in a simplified neurologic assessment questionnaire and neurologic examination.",

    "abstract": "Recent initiatives to improve health care quality have focused attention on length of stay (LOS) and readmission rates for surgical patients, yet these two outcomes may be inversely related. This study was designed to elucidate the risk factors for both outcomes and to clarify the relationship between them in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass (LEB).\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients who underwent LEB were identified from the 2007-2010 California State Inpatient Database. LOS and risk factors were analyzed using Poisson regression. Risk factors for 30-day readmission were analyzed using logistic regression.\nThere were 6307 patients who underwent LEB, and 1291 (20%) were readmitted. The average index LOS was 8.3\u00a0days for those who were readmitted and 5.5\u00a0days for those who were not (P\u00a0< .0001) and was an independent risk factor for 30-day readmission. The significant factors with the largest effect estimates for increased LOS reflected disease severity and postoperative complications: emergency department admission; advanced PAD; postoperative pneumonia, respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, wound/graft infection, graft complication, and discharge to a nursing facility. Independent predictors of readmission, other than LOS, reflected underlying patient factors: advanced PAD, chronic lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, postoperative congestive heart failure, and discharge status. Age, Medicaid or private insurance, and low income were protective. Of the 1291 readmissions, 453 (35%) were for definitive complications.\nIn patients undergoing LEB, LOS is primarily associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications, whereas 30-day readmission is largely explained by underlying patient illness. Additionally, increased LOS is an independent risk factor for readmission. These findings suggest that efforts to reduce both LOS and readmission will be complementary. Furthermore, they support the notion that both LOS and 30-day readmission rates should be risk-adjusted.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about acute peripheral arterial thrombosis in patients with concomitant cancer. Small studies suggest that revascularization in this patient group is associated with thrombosis and increased risk of amputation and death. We investigated the frequency of cancer in patients operated on for acute peripheral arterial thrombosis and the long-term risk of amputation, mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in a national cohort.\nThis was a prospective case/noncase study comprising all Danish citizens undergoing vascular surgery for acute arterial thrombosis from 1986 to 2012 with up to 26 years of follow-up.\nA total of 7840 patients were treated surgically for acute arterial thrombosis; 2384 (30.4%) were previously diagnosed with cancer or developed cancer during the observation period. Risk of amputation was not significantly different in patients with or without cancer, except in patients with cancer diagnosed <24 months before acute limb ischemia (hazard ratio, 2.0). Mortality was significantly greater in all patients having or developing cancer within 24 months after surgery (hazard ratio, 1.2-2.2). The frequencies of myocardial infarction and stroke were similar to those among patients without cancer.\nOne of five patients operated on for acute limb ischemia has a diagnosis of cancer, and a further 3.4% will develop cancer within 24 months. The data further show that patients with acute limb ischemia and concomitant cancer can be successfully revascularized and that the majority of these patients preserve their limb. Cancer should therefore not contravene interventional treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study retrospectively analyzed our 33-year experience with surgical management of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs), with particular attention paid to early and long-term results.\nFrom January 1981 to December 2013, 234 open surgical interventions for PAA were performed in 196 patients. Data concerning these interventions were collected in a dedicated database containing main preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative features. Early (intraoperative and\u00a0<30\u00a0days) results were analyzed for mortality, thrombosis, reintervention, and amputation rates. The follow-up program consisted of clinical and duplex ultrasound examinations at 1\u00a0month and yearly thereafter. Patients who did not accomplish follow-up examinations were interviewed by telephone. Additional data regarding long-term survival and major clinical events were obtained from the Regional Health Care database. Follow-up results were analyzed for survival, primary and secondary patency, and amputations rates.\nPatients were predominantly males (186 [95%]), with a mean age of 68.5\u00a0\u00b1 9.9\u00a0years. The PAA was asymptomatic in 97 limbs, intermittent claudication was present in 68, and limb-threatening ischemia was present in 62. Aneurysmal rupture occurred in six patients, and venous compression with leg swelling and pain was present in one patient. The intervention consisted of aneurysmal ligation and bypass grafting in 122 interventions, aneurysmectomy with graft interposition was used in 108, and four patients underwent aneurysmectomy with an end-to-end anastomosis. An autologous vein was used in 49 interventions, and a prosthetic graft was used in 181. In 71 interventions a posterior approach was used, and in the remaining 163, a medial approach was preferred. There were two perioperative deaths, with a cumulative mortality rate of 1%. Perioperative thrombosis occurred after 18 interventions (7.7%). A successful reintervention was performed in 10 of those patients, whereas surgical thrombectomy was ineffective in one patient and leg amputation was necessary. The remaining seven patients underwent major amputation without any new surgical attempt. An adjunctive major amputation was necessary in a patient with a patent bypass for irreversible foot ischemia. The cumulative rate of amputations at 30\u00a0days was 3.8% (9 of 234 limbs). Mean duration of follow-up was 62\u00a0months (range 1-312\u00a0months). During follow-up, 31 deaths, 45 thromboses, and 10 amputations were recorded. The estimated 13-year survival rate was 50.8% (standard error [SE], 0.07%); during the same interval, primary patency, secondary patency, and limb preservation rates were 55.1% (SE, 0.05%), 68% (SE, 0.05%), and 86% (SE, 0.04%).\nOpen surgical repair of PAAs provided good results in our experience, with low rates of perioperative complications and an excellent durability in the very long-term setting, representing the benchmark for alternative techniques such as endovascular repair.",

Digital computed tomography angiograms were analyzed using centerline of flow measurements to determine aortic diameters. Patients with a distal aortic bifurcation diameter <18 mm were included in the study. End points were technical success, aortic disruption with retroperitoneal hemorrhage, stent graft complications (endoleaks, migration, sac enlargement, stenosis), reintervention, and iliac limb patency.\nEVAR was used to treat 112 patients (84 men and 28 women; mean age, 75 years) with aortic bifurcation <18 mm, including 34 (30%) who had diameter of <14 mm. Mean outer and inner aortic bifurcation diameter was 16 \u00b1 3 and 14 \u00b1 2 mm, respectively. Bifurcated stent grafts were used in 106 patients (95%). Six patients (5%) had planned aortouniiliac converters with femoral crossover graft. The aortic bifurcation was dilated after placement of bifurcated stent grafts using kissing balloon angioplasty in 80 patients (75%). All bifurcated stent grafts were successfully implanted, with no conversions to open repair or aortouniiliac converters. There were two early deaths (1.8%), and 12 patients (11%) developed early complications. No aortic disruptions or retroperitoneal hematomas occurred in the group treated with bifurcated grafts. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 11 patients (11%) treated by bifurcated stent grafts required reintervention to treat endoleak (n = 6) or iliac limb stenosis/occlusion (n = 5). One patient (17%) treated by aortouniiliac converter developed critical stenosis of an aortouniiliac graft limb, which was successfully treated with balloon angioplasty 29 months after the initial surgery. At 1 and 5 years, freedom from reintervention was 91% \u00b1 3% and 84% \u00b1 4%, respectively, for bifurcated stent grafts and 100% and 83% \u00b1 10%, respectively, for aortouniiliac converters. Primary and secondary iliac limb patency was 98% \u00b1 3% and 100%, respectively, for bifurcated stent grafts and 83% \u00b1 10% and 100%, respectively, for aortouniiliac converters.\nEVAR with bifurcated stent grafts is safe and effective in patients with a narrow distal aortic diameter, even when the aortic bifurcation measures <14 mm. Adjunctive balloon dilatation did not result in any bleeding complications from aortic disruption, and limb patency was excellent. Aortouniiliac converters are rarely needed for this indication.",

    "abstract": "Current guidelines suggest that arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is associated with survival advantage over arteriovenous graft (AVG). However, AVFs often require months to become functional, increasing tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) use, which can erode the benefit of an AVF. We sought to compare survival in patients with end-stage renal disease after creation of an AVF or AVG in patients starting hemodialysis (HD) with a TDC and to identify patient populations that may benefit from preferential use of AVG over AVF.\nUsing U.S. Renal Data System databases, we identified incident HD patients in 2005 through 2008 and observed them through 2008. Initial access type and clinical variables including albumin levels were assessed using U.S. Renal Data System data collection forms. Attempts at AVF and AVG creation in patients who started HD through a TDC were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes. We accounted for the effect of changes in access type by truncating follow-up when an additional AVF or AVG was performed. Survival curves were then constructed, and log-rank tests were used for pairwise survival comparisons, stratified by age. Multivariate analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazards regressions; variables were chosen using stepwise elimination. An interaction of access type and albumin level was detected, and Cox models using differing thresholds for albumin level were constructed. The primary outcome was survival.\nAmong the 138,245 patients who started with a TDC and had complete records amenable for analysis, 22.8% underwent AVF creation (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 68.9 \u00b1 12.5 years; 27.8% mortality at 1 year) and 7.6% underwent AVG placement (70.2 \u00b1 12.0 years; 28.2% mortality) within 3 months of HD initiation; 69.6% remained with a TDC (63.2 \u00b1 15.4 years; 33.8% mortality). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, AVF creation is equivalent to AVG placement in terms of survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-1.02; P = .349). AVG placement is superior to continued TDC use (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.48-1.61; P < .001). In patients older than 80 years with albumin levels >4.0 g/dL, AVF creation is associated with higher mortality hazard compared with AVG creation (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43; P = .013).\nFor patients who start HD through a TDC, placement of an AVF and AVG is associated with similar mortality hazard. Further study is necessary to determine the ideal access for patients in whom the survival advantage of an AVF over an AVG is uncertain.",

We hypothesized that delivery of engineered stromal cell-derived factor 1-alpha (ESA) in an ischemic hind limb will yield significant improvement in perfusion.\nMale rats underwent right femoral artery ligation, and animals were randomized to receive a 100\u00a0\u03bcL injection of saline (n\u00a0= 9) or 6\u00a0\u03bcg/kg dosage of equal volume of ESA (n\u00a0= 12) into the ipsilateral quadriceps muscle. Both groups of animals were also given an intraperitoneal injection of 40\u00a0\u03bcg/kg of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF). Perfusion was quantified using a laser Doppler imaging device preoperatively, and on postoperative days 0, 7, and 14. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify angiogenesis on day 14, and an mRNA profile was evaluated for angiogenic and inflammatory markers.\nCompared with the saline/GMCSF group at day 14, the ESA/GMCSF-injected animals had greater reperfusion ratios (Saline/GMCSF, 0.600\u00a0\u00b1 0.140 vs ESA/GMCSF, 0.900\u00a0\u00b1 0.181; group effect P\u00a0= .006; time effect P\u00a0< .0001; group\u00d7time effect P\u00a0< .0001), elevated capillary density (10\u00d7; Saline/GMCSF, 6.40\u00a0\u00b1 2.01 vs ESA/GMCSF, 18.55\u00a0\u00b1 5.30; P\u00a0< .01), and increased mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (Saline/GMCSF [n\u00a0= 6], 0.298\u00a0\u00b1 0.205 vs ESA/GMCSF [n\u00a0= 8], 0.456\u00a0\u00b1 0.139; P\u00a0= .03).\nDelivery of ESA significantly improves perfusion in a rat model of peripheral arterial disease via improved neovasculogenesis, a finding which may prove beneficial in the treatment strategy for this debilitating disease.",

We reviewed the technical success and clinical outcomes of PEVAR using large-diameter sheaths for the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms with thoracic, fenestrated, and branched stent grafts.\nThe clinical data of patients who underwent total PEVAR for descending thoracic aneurysm, thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, pararenal, and aortoiliac aneurysms using thoracic, fenestrated, and branched stent grafts between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed. Repairs with fenestrated-branched stent grafts were performed using commercially available or investigational devices under a physician-sponsored investigational device protocols. Percutaneous closure was performed using ultrasound guidance and two Perclose devices (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara Calif) per femoral puncture site. End points were technical success, access-related complications, morbidity, and mortality.\nThere were 102 patients, 77 male and 25 female, with a mean age of 75 \u00b1 8 years.

Fenestrated or branched endografts, or both, were placed in 72 patients (71%). Total percutaneous closure was performed in 170 femoral arteries using \u226520F-diameter sheaths in 163 (96%). Technical success was obtained in 161 femoral arteries (95%). There were no factors associated with technical failure. Access-related complications occurred in five patients (5%), including femoral artery thrombosis in three (3%), and retroperitoneal hematoma or pseudoaneurysm in one patient each (1%). There were no 30-day deaths. Freedom from access-related complications was 97% \u00b1 1% at 30 days and 1 year. No access-related complications occurred >30 days.\nTotal percutaneous technique can be safely performed with a high technical success rate and low rate of access complications in patients with thoracic and complex aortic disease requiring large-diameter sheaths. The rate of access-related complications (5%) is similar to that reported for PEVAR of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms using smaller-profile devices.",

    "abstract": "Long-term results of the posterior approach (PA) for the treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms are lacking in the literature. We reviewed our experience during a 13-year period in patients with popliteal artery aneurysms, comparing those treated through a PA with those operated on through a standard medial approach (MA).\nClinical data of all patients treated between February 1998 and October 2011 were retrospectively reviewed and outcomes analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and \u03c7(2), Wilcoxon, and log-rank tests were used for analysis.\nA total of 77 aneurysms were treated in 65 patients (64 men). Mean age was 68 years (range, 48-96 years). Thirty-six aneurysms were asymptomatic (47%). Mean sac diameter was 2.8 \u00b1 1 cm. A PA was used in 43 PAAs (55%) and an MA in 34. The PA and MA patients differed significantly in age (median being older), smoking history (more frequent in PA), and renal insufficiency and cerebrovascular disease (higher for MA). In 42 cases the aneurysm was symptomatic (54.5%) for chronic limb ischemia, with intermittent claudication in 18 patients, acute ischemia in 17, blue toe syndrome in 3, compression on adjacent structures in 3, and rupture with severe acute pain in 1. All PA repairs consisted of aneurysmectomy with an interposition graft with end-to-end anastomoses; among MA repairs, 22 interposition grafts and 12 bypasses were performed. A polytetrafluoroethylene graft was used in 54 cases. Five patients had an early thrombosis (two PA and three MA). No perioperative deaths occurred. Two patients sustained a permanent (PA) and a temporary (MA) peroneal nerve lesion. There were no early amputations. The median in-hospital stay was longer for MA (10 days) than for PA (7 days; P = .02). Median follow-up was 58.8 months (range, 5 days-166 months). Nine patients died during follow-up of unrelated causes. The 5-year primary and secondary patency rates were 59.6% \u00b1 8.6% and 96.5% \u00b1 3.4%, respectively, for PA, and 65.1% \u00b1 11.1% and 79.4% \u00b1 9.7%, respectively, for MA (P = .53 for primary patency rate and P = .22 for secondary patency rate). Limb salvage was 100% at 5 years and 93.3% \u00b1 6.4% at 10 years for PA and 91.1% \u00b1 6.3% at both time points for MA (P = .28).\nPA and MA both achieved satisfactory results in primary and secondary patency rates, as well as limb salvage, during long-term follow-up. The differences between the two groups were small and not statistically significant. PA was burdened by similar postoperative nerve and wound complications compared with MA. The in-hospital stay after PA was significantly lower.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the 30-day morbidity and mortality and in-hospital costs of elective fenestrated (fEVAR) and branched (bEVAR) endovascular aneurysm repairs at a single academic institution and determined factors that influence them.\nAll elective fEVAR or bEVAR patients treated between November 2007 and March 2014 in a Canadian academic hospital were included. Procedural details, 30-day morbidity and mortality rates, and cost of hospitalization were analyzed. Nonparametric bootstrap analysis was used to compare means between groups and calculate confidence intervals (CIs).\nThere were 84 consecutive fEVAR (n = 61) and bEVAR (n = 23) procedures. The 30-day mortality was 3.3% for fEVAR and 4.3% for bEVAR. Mean hospital stay was 7.2 \u00b1 0.8 days for fEVAR and 12.6 \u00b1 2.2 days for bEVAR. The mean cost of the index hospitalization was $57,000 for fEVAR and $91,000 for bEVAR. Device-related costs accounted for 55% of the total costs. The occurrence of intraoperative or postoperative events were used to further divide each of the fEVAR and bEVAR groups into \"complicated hospitalization\" (fEVAR, n = 10; bEVAR, n = 13) and \"uncomplicated hospitalization\" (fEVAR, n = 51; bEVAR, n = 10) groups. Device-related costs were not significantly different between the complicated and uncomplicated hospitalization groups (mean difference [95% CI] fEVAR: $3383 [-$3405 to $9809], P = .3; and bEVAR: $1930 [-$7892 to $11,288], P = .68). However, there were significant differences between the complicated and uncomplicated hospitalization groups in hospital length of stay (mean difference [95% CI] fEVAR: 8.1 [3.0-13.2] days, P = .001; and bEVAR: 10.8 [5.9-19.9] days, P = .002) and nondevice-related costs (mean difference [95% CI,] fEVAR: $25,843 [$11,689-$43,247], P = .001; and bEVAR; $20,326 [$9362-$36,615], P = .002).\nbEVAR and fEVAR are expensive interventions. Intraoperative adverse events and postoperative systemic complications dramatically increase costs and length of stay. Measures to minimize complications will reduce hospitalization costs and improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a commonly performed vascular operation. Yet, postoperative length of stay (LOS) varies greatly, even within institutions. The present study reviewed the morbidity, mortality, and the financial effect of increased LOS to establish modifiable factors associated with prolonged hospital LOS, with the goal of improving quality.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database was used to identify all patients undergoing primary, elective EVAR at a single institution between January 1, 2011, and May 28, 2014. Preoperative patient characteristics, intraoperative details, postoperative factors, long-term outcomes, and cost data were reviewed using an Institutional Review Board-approved prospectively collected database. Multivariate analysis was used to determine statistical difference between patients with LOS \u22642 days and >2 days.\nComplete 30-day variable and cost data were available for 138 patients with an average follow-up of 12 months; of these, 46 (33%) had a LOS >2 days. Variables determined to be statistically significant predictors of prolonged LOS included aneurysm diameter (P = .03), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification score (P < .001), thromboembolectomy (P = .01), and increased postoperative cardiac (P < .001) and renal (P = .01) complications. Specifically, modifiable risk factors that contributed to increased LOS included performance of a concomitant procedure (P < .001), increased volume of iodinated contrast (P = .05), increased volume of intraoperative crystalloid (P = .05), placement in an intensive care unit (P < .001), return to the operating room (P < .001), and the use of vasoactive medications (P < .001). Hospital charges ($102,000 \u00b1 $41,000 vs $180,000 \u00b1 $73,000; P = .01) and costs ($27,000 \u00b1 $10,000 vs $45,000 \u00b1 $19,000 P = .01) were significantly higher in patients with prolonged LOS; however, there was no difference in physician charges ($8000 \u00b1 $5700 vs $12,000 \u00b1 $12,000; P = .09). Increased LOS after EVAR was associated with an increase in mortality at 1 month (0% vs 4% P = .05) and 12 months (3% vs 13% P = .03).\nThis study highlights several modifiable risk factors leading to increased LOS after EVAR, including performance of concomitant procedures, admission to the intensive care unit, and postoperative renal and cardiac complications. Further, increased LOS was associated with increased charges, costs, morbidity, and mortality after EVAR. This study highlights specific areas of focus for decreasing LOS after EVAR and, in turn, improving quality in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. We systematically reviewed the evidence to compare bypass surgery with endovascular revascularization in patients with critical limb ischemia.\nWe systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Scopus through October 2014 for comparative studies (randomized and nonrandomized). Predefined outcomes of interest were mortality, major amputation, patency, and wound healing. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) of the outcomes of interest using the random-effects model.\nNine studies that enrolled 3071 subjects were included. There was no significant difference in mortality (OR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-1.16) or amputation (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.87-1.65). Bypass surgery was associated with higher primary patency (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.25-4.99) and assisted primary patency (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.53-7.51). The quality of evidence was low for mortality and amputation outcomes and moderate for patency outcomes.\nLow quality of evidence due to imprecision and heterogeneity suggests that bypass surgery and endovascular approaches may have similar effect on mortality and major amputations. However, better primary and primary assisted patency can be expected with surgery.",

We describe complications associated with vascular chronic Q fever as found in the largest cohort of chronic Q fever patients so far.\nPatients with proven or probable chronic Q fever with a focus of infection in an aortic aneurysm or vascular graft were included in this study, using the Dutch national chronic Q fever database.\nA total of 122 patients were diagnosed with vascular chronic Q fever between April 2008 and June 2012. The infection affected a vascular graft in 62 patients (50.8%) and an aneurysm in 53 patients (43.7%). Seven patients (5.7%) had a different vascular focus. Thirty-six patients (29.5%) presented with acute complications, and 35 of these patients (97.2%) underwent surgery. Following diagnosis and start of antibiotic treatment, 26 patients (21.3%) presented with a variety of complications requiring surgical treatment during a mean follow-up of 14.1\u00a0\u00b1 9.1\u00a0months. The overall mortality rate was 23.7%. Among these patients, mortality was associated with chronic Q fever in 18 patients (62.1%).\nThe management of vascular infections with C.\u00a0burnetii tends to be complicated.

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transcatheter embolization of splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) has been widely accepted as the first line of treatment in patients with symptoms, rupture, or large aneurysm size. Although embolization can usually be performed safely, ischemic complications, such as splenic infarct or abscess, occur in some patients. This study evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of endovascular SAA repair (ESAAR) using stent grafts, which may allow treatment while preserving flow to the spleen.\nWe reviewed the clinical data of all consecutive patients who underwent ESAAR using stent grafts. Brachial access was used except for patients with favorable angle of origin from the aorta. To overcome tortuosity and provide support, a coaxial system with a hydrophilic sheath was used. Low-profile 0.018-inch stent grafts were used for distal SAAs with a 10-mm to 15-mm length of proximal and distal segment of splenic artery measuring 4 to 11 mm in diameter. Follow-up included clinical examination and computed tomography imaging within 4 to 6 months after the procedure and yearly thereafter. End points were morbidity, stent graft patency, and freedom from endoleaks and reinterventions.\nESAAR was attempted in 10 patients, four males and six females, with median age of 64 years (range, 48-77 years). Median SAA size was 2.8 cm (range, 2-5.7 cm). Nine patients were asymptomatic, and one had pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding. The arterial access site was the brachial artery in six patients and the femoral artery in four. Two patients had brachial and femoral access to facilitate splenic artery stenting. Technical success of ESAAR using stent grafts was 80% (8 of 10). In two patients with distal SAAs, stent graft placement was not possible due to excessive vessel tortuosity, and treatment was by coil embolization. One patient developed brachial artery thrombosis, which was treated surgically. There were no ischemic complications in patients treated by ESAAR with stent grafts. Median length of stay was 1 day. One patient treated by coil embolization developed splenic infarct, which required readmission for pain control. Median follow-up was 9 months. Follow-up imaging in all successfully stented patients revealed patent stent grafts, no endoleak, and no aneurysm sac enlargement. No reinterventions were required.\nESAAR using self-expandable stent grafts offers a viable alternative to coil embolization in selected patients with SAAs. Distal SAAs with excessive vessel tortuosity may result in technical failure requiring embolization. Among patients who underwent successful ESAAR, there were no ischemic complications, stent graft occlusions, endoleaks, or sac enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for the aortic arch aneurysm is challenging because of its curved anatomic configuration and the presence of the supra-aortic branches. The Najuta fenestrated endograft (Kawasumi Laboratories, Inc, Tokyo, Japan) was developed to treat aortic arch diseases, offering maximal proximal landing length while preserving the blood flow to the supra-aortic branches. We evaluated the perioperative and midterm outcomes of this fenestrated endograft.\nBetween July 2007 and July 2013, 32 patients were treated with the Najuta endograft at three vascular centers. The mean age of the patients was 74.5 \u00b1 9.8 years (23 patients were men). Technical success, complication, overall survival rate, freedom from aneurysm-related death, secondary intervention, aneurysm enlargement, device migration, and patency of supra-aortic branches were investigated retrospectively.\nThe median follow-up period was 2.5 years (range, 0.2-6.2 years). Seventy-one supra-aortic vessels (30 brachiocephalic arteries, 31 left common carotid arteries, 10 left subclavian arteries) were planned to be preserved with fenestrations. Technical success rate was 91% (29 of 32; three type I endoleaks were seen), and five perioperative complications (two Stanford A dissections, one cerebral infarction, one celiac artery obstruction, one spinal cord ischemia) were recognized. Perioperative death was not observed. Overall survival rate and rate of freedom from aneurysm-related death at 3 years were 67% and 97%, respectively. The rate of freedom from secondary intervention and the rate of freedom from aneurysm enlargement at 3 years were 84% and 85%, respectively. Device migration was not observed. There were two branch (left carotid artery and left subclavian artery) occlusions at 2 weeks after TEVAR due to the endograft's infolding. No other branch occlusion was seen in this follow-up period. As a result, the patency rate of the supra-aortic branch was 97% at 3 years.\nThe perioperative and 3-year outcomes of TEVAR using the Najuta precurved, fenestrated endograft demonstrated high freedom from aneurysm enlargement and patency rates of the supra-aortic branches.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to report the incidence and associated risk factors of perioperative spinal cord ischemia (SCI) after endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) with fenestrated and branched stent grafts.\nThe study included consecutive patients with TAAA treated with fenestrated and branched stent grafts within the period January 2004 to December 2014. Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms treated with fenestrated and branched grafts, even if including all four visceral vessels, were excluded. Patients who died within 30 days after the procedure were excluded from the analysis for SCI. All data were collected prospectively.\nA total of 218 patients (167 men; mean age, 68.8 \u00b1 7.5 years) were treated. Thirty-day mortality was 17 patients (7.8%). TAAA distribution among the 201 surviving patients was as follows: type I, n = 17 (8.5%); type II, n = 55 (27.4%); type III, n = 63 (31.3%); type IV, n = 54 (26.9%); and type V, n = 12 (5.9%). In the surviving patients, 21 (10.4%) developed perioperative SCI. At 30 days postoperatively, 13 (6.5%) of those patients had transient lower limb weakness, 5 patients (2.5%) had persistent lower limb weakness requiring assistance to stand or to walk, and 3 patients (1.5%) had persistent paraplegia. Five of the 21 patients awoke from anesthesia with a neurologic deficit. The remaining 16 patients had a later postoperative onset of SCI, with the majority of them (14 of 16) within 72 hours after the operation. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression identified operation time >300 minutes (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-21.1; P < .001), peripheral arterial disease (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2-21.9; P = .002), and baseline renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min; OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1-16.1; P = .04) as independent risk factors for SCI.\nIn our experience, most SCI events after endovascular TAAA repair are transient, with persistent paraplegia being rare. Patients with prolonged procedure duration, peripheral arterial disease, and baseline renal insufficiency appear to be at higher risk for development of SCI after endovascular TAAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging for vein bypass graft (VBG) surveillance is confounded by technical and physiologic factors that reduce the sensitivity for detecting impending graft failure. In contrast, three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (CTA) offers high-fidelity anatomic characterization of VBGs, but its utility in detecting at risk grafts is unknown. The current study analyzed the correlation between DUS and CTA for detection of vein graft stenosis and evaluated the relationship of the observed abnormalities to VBG failure.\nConsecutive lower extremity VBG patients underwent surveillance with concurrent DUS imaging and CTA at 1 week and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. A standardized algorithm was used for CT reconstruction and extraction of the lumen geometries at 1-mm intervals. At each interval, CT-derived cross-sectional areas were coregistered and correlated to DUS peak systolic velocities (PSVs) within six predesignated anatomic zones and then analyzed for outcome association. Vein graft failure was defined as pathologic change within a given anatomic zone resulting in thrombosis, amputation, or reintervention within the 6-month period after the observed time point.\nThe study recruited 54 patients, and 10 (18%) experienced failure \u226418 months of implantation. The expected inverse relationship between cross-sectional area and PSV was only weakly correlated (Spearman rank coefficient = -0.19). Moderate elevations in the PSV ratio (PSVr; 2-3.5) were frequently transient, with 14 of 18 grafts (78%) demonstrating ratio reduction on subsequent imaging. A PSVr \u22653.5 was associated with a 67% failure rate. CT stenosis <50% was highly correlated with success (0 failures); however, high-grade (>80%) CT stenosis was more likely to succeed than to fail (25%). Significant discordance between CT and DUS was found in 18 patients. Although 14 of these patients had CT stenosis >70% with a PSVr <3.5, subsequent failure occurred in only two. Conversely, graft failure occurred in three of four patients with CT stenosis <70% but PSVr >3.5. Focused analysis of these patients using computational fluid dynamic modeling demonstrated that vein side branches, local tortuosity, regional diameter variations, and venovenostomies were the drivers of these discrepancies.\nThis analysis demonstrated that a PSVr \u22653.5 is strongly correlated with VBG failure, whereas the natural history of moderately elevated PSVr (2-3.5) is largely clinically benign. Although minimum stenosis on the CT scan was highly predictive of success, high-grade CT stenosis was infrequently associated with failure. The interaction of anatomic features with the local flow dynamics was identified as the primary confounder for a direct correlation between CT and DUS imaging.",

This study assessed the rates of ruptured and total AAA to determine regional variations within Saskatchewan and ascertain whether there are areas of high AAA prevalence that would possibly benefit from the implementation of a targeted screening program.\nAll diagnoses of AAA from 2001 to 2012 in the province of Saskatchewan were reviewed, with patients grouped by health region of residence. Diagnoses of ruptured and unruptured AAAs were obtained from the Saskatchewan Discharge Abstracts Database, Medical Services Billings Claims data, and Vital Statistics data.\nDuring the study period, 6163 AAAs were diagnosed. The provincial age-adjusted rate of AAA was 53.0/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 48.8-57.6). The highest age-adjusted rate of AAA was found in the Five Hills Health Region (FHHR), at 63.1/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 57.6-69.0), which was significantly higher than the provincial average (P\u00a0< .05).

    "abstract": "Although radial-cephalic (RC) and brachial-cephalic (BC) fistulas are the recommended primary accesses for hemodialysis, access failure is frequently due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis (JAS). Because increased turbulence at the anastomosis may lead to JAS, we hypothesized that an acute angle at the arteriovenous anastomosis is associated with JAS, reduced fistula patency, and increased reinterventions.\nBetween February 2013 and September 2014, the anastomotic angle and vessel diameters were prospectively collected for all patients who underwent RC or BC fistula creation. The primary end point was reintervention on the juxta-anastomotic segment. Secondary end points were primary and secondary patency of the fistula.\nA total of 149 patients (median age, 72 years) received 73 RC and 76 BC fistulas; the median follow-up was 7 months (range, 1-22 months) for RC and 12 months (range, 2-24 months) for BC fistulas. The median anastomotic angle in RC fistulas, was 30\u00b0. Anastomotic angles of <30\u00b0 were associated with reduced primary patency (38% vs 66%, P = .003) and secondary patency (84% vs 97%, P = .02) and increased numbers of reinterventions (67% vs 34%, P = .001). Cox analysis showed that an anastomotic angle of <30\u00b0 was an independent factor predicting decreased primary patency (P = .009) and secondary patency (P = .03) as well as increased reinterventions (P = .004). In BC fistulas, the median anastomotic angle was 90\u00b0. Patients with anastomotic angles <90\u00b0 and \u226590\u00b0 had similar rates of primary patency (67% vs 67%, P = .39) and secondary patency (93% vs 94%, P = .89) at 6 months, with a similar reintervention rate at 12 months (31% vs 32%, P = .56). Vein diameter was the only factor that predicted reintervention (P < .0001).\nRC fistulas with anastomotic angles of <30\u00b0 have reduced primary and secondary patency and increased numbers of reinterventions, suggesting that, if possible, surgeons should avoid an anastomotic angle of <30\u00b0 when creating RC fistulas. Anastomotic angles of <90\u00b0 or \u226590\u00b0 may not play a role in outcome of BC fistulas.",

    "abstract": "Aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination with electrocardiography gating is becoming the clinical routine image acquisition protocol for diagnosis and intervention planning. To minimize motion artifact, the images are reconstructed in the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. The aim of our study was to quantify aortic strain in an elderly nonaneurysmatic patient cohort and to identify the phases of the R-R cycle that correspond to the minimal and maximal aortic diameters. The quantification of aortic strain may enable the improvement of intervention planning and the introduction of more effective dose-saving protocols for CTA scans.\nWe assessed CTA images of 28 patients (14 men; mean age, 74 years). Aortic calcium score was calculated on native images. Angiography images were reconstructed in equally spaced 10 phases of the R-R cycle. After semiautomatic centerline analysis, we measured the cross-sectional areas in each of the 10 phases at 9 specific segments between the ascending aorta and the common iliac bifurcation representing the attachment sites of thoracic and abdominal stent grafts. Area-derived effective diameter, pulsatility (Amax - Amin), and strain [(Amax - Amin)/Amin] were calculated. Repeated measurements were taken to evaluate inter-reader and intrareader reproducibility (10-10 patients each).\nA total of 4320 measurements were performed. We found significant difference between diastolic and systolic diameters (DD,Z0 = 33.2, DS,Z0 = 34.4; P < .001). Pulsatility values of the vessel diameters were 1.0 to 1.1 mm in the thoracic aorta, 0.7 to 0.9 mm in the abdominal aorta, and 0.5 to 0.6 mm in the common iliac arteries. Negative, moderate correlations were found between aortic strain and age (r = -0.586; P = .001), aortic strain and plaque area (r = -0.429; P = .026), and age and body mass index (r = -0.412; P = .029). We found positive, moderate correlation between age and plaque area (r = 0.594; P = .001). The aortic pulsatility curve has a positive extreme at 30% and a negative extreme at 90% of the R-R cycle throughout the aorta. Lin concordance coefficients were 0.987 for inter-reader and 0.994 for intrareader correlations.\nAortic strain can be reliably quantified on electrocardiography-gated CTA images. Pulsatility of the aorta can be substantial in the thoracic aortic segments of young patients; therefore, the routine use of systolic images is not recommended. In addition, we demonstrated that images at 30% of the heart cycle correspond to the largest diameter of the aorta.",

Pulsatility values of the vessel diameters were 1.0 to 1.1 mm in the thoracic aorta, 0.7 to 0.9 mm in the abdominal aorta, and 0.5 to 0.6 mm in the common iliac arteries. Negative, moderate correlations were found between aortic strain and age (r = -0.586; P = .001), aortic strain and plaque area (r = -0.429; P = .026), and age and body mass index (r = -0.412; P = .029). We found positive, moderate correlation between age and plaque area (r = 0.594; P = .001). The aortic pulsatility curve has a positive extreme at 30% and a negative extreme at 90% of the R-R cycle throughout the aorta.

    "abstract": "Although the effect of trainee involvement has been evaluated across different specialties, their effects on perioperative outcomes after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair have not been examined. Our goal was to examine the association between resident and fellow intraoperative participation with perioperative outcomes of endovascular AAA repair (EVAR), open infrarenal AAA repair (OIAR), and open juxtarenal AAA repair (OJAR).\nThe American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set (2005-2012) was queried to identify all patients who underwent EVAR, OIAR, or OJAR. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the association of trainee involvement with perioperative morbidity and mortality.\nWe identified 16,977 patients: 12,003 with EVAR, 3655 with OIAR, and 1319 with OJAR. Propensity matching and multivariate analyses revealed that there was no significant difference in perioperative death, cardiac arrest/myocardial infarction, pulmonary, renal, venous thromboembolic, or wound complications, or return to the operating room. However, trainee involvement in AAA repair led to a significant increase in operative time for EVAR (163 \u00b1 77 vs 140 \u00b1 67 minutes; P < .001), OIAR (217 \u00b1 91 vs 185 \u00b1 76 minutes; P < .001), and OJAR (267 \u00b1 115 vs 214 \u00b1 106 minutes; P < .001) and an extended length of stay for EVAR (3.1 \u00b1 5.3 vs 2.8 \u00b1 4.5 days; P < .001) and OIAR (10.6 \u00b1 11.8 vs 9.1 \u00b1 8.9 days; P < .001).\nTrainee participation in aneurysm repair was not associated with major adverse perioperative outcomes. However, it was associated with an increased operative time and length of stay and therefore may lead to increased resource utilization and cost.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia continues to be a life-threatening insult in often-elderly patients with many comorbidities. Recognition and correct diagnosis can be an issue leading to delays in therapy that result in loss of bowel or life, or both. The basic surgical principals in treating acute mesenteric ischemia have long been early recognition, resuscitation, urgent revascularization, resection of necrotic bowel, and reassessment with second-look laparotomies. Endovascular techniques now offer a less invasive alternative, but whether an endovascular-first or open surgery-first approach is preferred in most patients is unclear. Our discussants will attempt to clarify these issues.",

    "abstract": "Prevalence of peripheral arterial disease is equal in men and women. However, women seem to suffer more from the burden of disease. Current studies on gender-related outcomes following supervised exercise therapy (SET) for intermittent claudication (IC) yield conflicting results.\nA follow-up analysis was performed on data from the 2010 Exercise Therapy in Peripheral Arterial Disease (EXITPAD) study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial including IC patients receiving SET or a walking advice. The SET program was supervised by physiotherapists and included interval-based treadmill walking approximating maximal pain combined with activities such as cycling and rowing. Patients usually started with three 30-minute sessions a week. Training frequency was adapted during the following year on the basis of individual needs. The primary outcome was gender differences regarding the change in absolute claudication distance (ACD) after SET. ACD was defined as the number of meters that a patient had covered just before he or she was forced to stop walking because of intolerable pain. Secondary outcomes were gender differences in change of functional walking distance, quality of life, and walking (dis)ability after SET. Walking distances were obtained by standardized treadmill testing according to the Gardner-Skinner protocol. Quality of life was measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and walking (dis)ability was determined by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). Measurements were performed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Only patients who met the 12-month follow-up measure were included in the analysis.\nA total of 113 men and 56 women were available for analysis. At baseline, groups were similar in terms of clinical characteristics and ACD walking distances (men, 250 meters; women, 270 meters; P = .45). ACD improved for both sexes. However, ACD increase was significantly lower for women than for men during the first 3 months of SET (\u0394 280 meters for men vs \u0394 220 meters for women; P = .04). Moreover, absolute walking distance was significantly shorter for women compared with men after 1 year (565 meters vs 660 meters; P = .032). Women also reported less on several WIQ subdomains, although total WIQ score was similar (0.69 for men vs 0.61 for women; P = .592). No differences in quality of life after SET were observed.\nWomen with IC benefit less during the first 3 months of SET and have lower absolute walking distances after 12 months of follow-up compared with men. More research is needed to determine whether gender-based IC treatment strategies are required.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine if intramuscular and intra-arterial stem cell injections delay or prevent major limb amputations, improve ankle-brachial index measurements, relieve rest pain, and improve ulcer healing.\nA prospective case series with interventions occurring between December 2007 and September 2012 and a 3-month minimum follow-up was conducted at an urban tertiary care referral hospital. Patients with severe limb-threatening peripheral arterial disease, without other options for revascularization, were eligible for enrollment. Dual intramuscular and intra-arterial injection of bone marrow mononuclear cells harvested from the iliac crest was performed. Major limb amputation at 3 months was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included ankle-brachial index measurements, rest pain, and ulceration healing. Kaplan-Meier survivorship was performed to ascertain overall survivorship of the procedure.\nNo complications related to the procedure were reported. Of 49 patients (56 limbs) enrolled, two patients (two limbs) died, but had not undergone major amputation, and five limbs (8.9%) underwent major amputation within the first 3 months. Three-month follow-up evaluations were conducted on the remaining 49 limbs (42 patients). Median postprocedure revised Rutherford and Fontaine classifications were significantly lower compared with median baseline classifications. After 3 months, seven patients (nine limbs) died but had not undergone major amputation, and seven limbs (14.3%) underwent major amputation. At a mean follow-up of 18.2 months, the remaining 33 limbs (29 patients) had not undergone a major amputation. Freedom from major adverse limb events (MALE) was 91.1% (95% confidence interval, 79.9-96.2) at 3 months and 75.6% (95% confidence interval, 59.4-86.1) at 12 months.\nThis procedure was designed to improve limb perfusion in an effort to salvage limbs in patients for whom amputation was the only viable treatment option. The results of this analysis indicate that it is an effective strategy for limb salvage for patients with severe peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "Neck radiation therapy (XRT) can induce carotid artery stenosis and may increase the technical difficulty of endarterectomy. It is considered a relative indication for carotid angioplasty and carotid artery stenting (CAS). This study sought to evaluate differences in CAS embolic potential and restenosis performed on XRT and non-XRT patients.\nAt three institutions, 366 CAS procedures were performed on 321 patients (XRT, n = 43; non-XRT, n = 323). Mean follow-up was 410 days (median, 282 days; range, 7-1920 days). Patients were observed with duplex ultrasound to assess for restenosis. Additional end points included target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial and cerebrovascular events, and perioperative complications. Captured particulate from embolic protection filters was analyzed with photomicroscopy and image analysis software for 27 XRT and 214 non-XRT filters.\nXRT patients were more likely to be male and had lower rates of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus, although the mean age at procedure did not differ. There was no increase in severe internal carotid tortuosity among XRT patients (XRT: 50% vs non-XRT: 34.7%; P = .06). Indication for CAS did not differ between the two groups, including the number of CAS procedures performed for symptomatic carotid stenosis (XRT: 39.7% vs non-XRT: 39.0%; P = NS). Perioperative outcomes, including the composite 30-day stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality, were not significantly different (XRT: 2.6% vs non-XRT: 3.9%; P = NS.) There were no significant differences in restenosis rate at the 50% (XRT: 9.4% vs non-XRT: 8.6%; P = NS) or 70% (XRT: 3.5% vs non-XRT: 8.6%; P = NS) threshold. Filter particle analysis revealed that filters from XRT patients had more numerous large particles per filter (1.4 vs 0.7; P < .05) and larger mean particle size (464.1 \u03bcm vs 320.0 \u03bcm; P < .05). TLR did not differ significantly between the groups.\nIn contrast to earlier studies, this analysis reveals that there are significant differences in XRT and non-XRT patients undergoing CAS in terms of medical comorbidities and embolic material captured in embolic protection filters. The decreased incidence of atherosclerotic risk factors was observed in XRT patients probably because XRT was the primary factor responsible for carotid stenosis. Despite increased embolic particle size, CAS can be performed safely with no increased morbidity, TLR, or restenosis in XRT patients.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare but remain challenging lesions when treatment is required. Endovascular techniques may be useful in selected, more proximal lesions with amenable morphology, but open surgical repair is often required for more distal, anatomically complex hilar RAAs that often have several branches and unfavorable anatomy. This study reviewed a single-center experience with ex vivo repair of 14 of these more complex, distal RAAs.\nThe records of 14 consecutive patients having ex vivo RAA repair between 1997 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, operative details, and blood pressure and renal function status were recorded. Graft patency was observed with renal duplex sonography.\nFourteen hilar RAAs were repaired in 10 women and 4 men with a mean age of 54 years. Hypertension was present in 12 (86%). Preoperative renal dysfunction was present in two (14%). Aneurysm size averaged 2.9 cm. Six RAAs (43%) were symptomatic with flank or abdominal pain. Ex vivo repair was performed in all cases with use of saphenous vein for renal-renal bypass. No patient had pelvic autotransplantation or concomitant aortic reconstruction. Ex vivo RAA repair was technically successful in 12 cases; two patients required nephrectomy. Two patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency had improvement postoperatively, but hypertension was clinically unchanged in all patients. No patient required postoperative dialysis. Duplex sonography documented continued graft patency in the 12 technically successful cases during a mean follow-up of 19 months.\nOpen ex vivo surgical repair with renal-renal bypass is a successful and durable treatment for complex distal RAAs that require repair. These procedures had low morbidity and mortality and an acceptable rate of renal function preservation. Blood pressure control in these patients did not change significantly after RAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to analyze periprocedural and 1-year outcomes of peripheral endovascular intervention (PVI) for critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nWe reviewed 1244 patients undergoing 1414 PVIs for CLI (rest pain, 29%; tissue loss, 71%) within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) from January 2010 to December 2011. Overall survival (OS), amputation-free survival (AFS), and freedom from major amputation at 1 year were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nThe number of arteries treated during each procedure were 1 (49%), 2 (35%), 3 (12%), and \u22654 (5%). Target arterial segments and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classifications were aortoiliac, 27% (A, 48%; B, 28%; C, 12%; and D, 12%); femoral-popliteal, 48% (A, 29%; B, 34%; C, 20%; and D, 17%); and infrapopliteal, 25% (A, 17%; B, 14%; C, 25%; D, 44%). Technical success was 92%. Complications included access site hematoma (5.0%), occlusion (0.3%), and distal embolization (2.4%). Mortality and major amputation rates were 2.8% and 2.2% at 30 days, respectively. Overall percutaneous or open reintervention rate was 8.0% during the first year. At 1-year, OS, AFS, and freedom from major amputation were 87%, 87%, and 94% for patients with rest pain and 80%, 71%, and 81% for patients with tissue loss.

Independent predictors of major amputation (C index = .69) at 1 year included dialysis (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5; P < .01), tissue loss (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; P = .02), prior major contralateral amputation (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .02), non-Caucasian race (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9; P = .045), and male gender (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; P = .03), whereas smoking (HR, .60; 95% CI, 0.4-1.0; P = .042) was protective.\nSurvival and major amputation after PVI for CLI are associated with different patient characteristics. Dialysis dependence is a common predictor that portends especially poor outcomes. These data may facilitate efforts to improve patient selection and, after further validation, enable risk-adjusted outcome reporting for CLI patients undergoing PVI.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated changes in aortic neck diameter after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using a balloon-expandable stent (BES) endograft compared with a commercially available self-expanding stent (SES) endograft. We hypothesized that forces applied to the aortic neck by SES endografts may induce aortic neck enlargement over time and that such enlargement may not occur in aneurysm patients treated with a device that does not use a proximal SES.\nThis was a retrospective quantitative computed tomography (CT) image analysis of patients treated with the Nellix (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) BES (n = 49) or the Endurant II (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) SES (n = 56) endograft from 2008 to 2010. Patients with preimplant, postimplant, and at least 1-year serial CT scans underwent quantitative morphometric assessment by two independent vascular radiologists blinded to the outcome results. Changes in the infrarenal neck over time were compared with the suprarenal aorta for each patient.\nFollow-up extended to 4.8 years for the BES and to 4.6 years for the SES, with no significant difference in median follow-up time (34 months for BESs and 24 months for SESs; P = .06). There were no differences in preimplant neck diameter (25.2 \u00b1 0.9 mm vs 25.7 \u00b1 1.1 mm; P = .54) or length (27.7 \u00b1 3.7 mm vs 23.6 \u00b1 3.7 mm; P = .12) between BESs and SESs at baseline. After implantation, neck diameter increased by 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 mm in BES patients and 2.6 \u00b1 0.5 mm in SES patients (P = .07) compared with the preoperative diameter. At 3 years, neck diameter increased by 0.5 \u00b1 0.9 mm in BES patients and by 3.8 \u00b1 1.0 mm in SES patients (P = .0002) compared with the first postoperative CT scan. The annual postimplant rate of increase in the infrarenal neck diameter was fivefold greater in SES patients (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y) than in BES patients (0.22 \u00b1 0.04 mm/y; P < .0001). There were no significant differences in the diameter of the suprarenal aorta at baseline or at 3 years and no differences in the annual rate of change in suprarenal aortic diameter between BES and SES endografts.\nEVAR using SES endografts resulted in progressive infrarenal aortic neck enlargement, whereas EVAR using BES endografts resulted in no neck enlargement over time. These data suggest that infrarenal neck enlargement after EVAR with SES endografts is likely related to the force exerted by SES elements rather than disease progression in the infrarenal neck.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery aneurysms are rare in the general population, although the true incidence and natural history remain elusive. Controversy over criteria for repair persists across decades. Indications for repair presently include aneurysm size >2 cm, female gender within childbearing age, symptoms like pain and hematuria, medically refractory hypertension including that associated with functionally important renal artery stenosis, thromboembolism, dissection, and rupture. Conventional surgical reconstruction options are variable and continue to offer technically sound and durable results. Endovascular therapies with novel devices also offer technical success with few major adverse events, and are increasingly employed as indications for intervention broaden. This review summarizes the accumulated evidence on true renal artery aneurysms with a particular focus on contemporary treatment criteria, natural history, options for repair and outcomes following such.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the etiologic factors that lead to the occurrence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. Recent work has suggested that macrophages may play an important role in progression of a number of other vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis; however, whether these cells are present within the ILT of a progressing AAA is unknown. The purpose of this work was to define the presence, phenotype, and spatial distribution of macrophages within the ILT excised from six patients. We hypothesized that the ILT contains a population of activated macrophages with a distinct, nonclassical phenotypic profile.\nILT samples were examined using histologic staining and immunofluorescent labeling for multiple markers of activated macrophages (cluster of differentiation [CD]45, CD68, human leukocyte antigen-DR, matrix metalloproteinase 9) and the additional markers \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, CD34, CD105, fetal liver kinase-1, and collagen I and III.\nHistologic staining revealed a distinct laminar organization of collagen within the shoulder region of the ILT lumen and a spatially heterogeneous cell composition within the ILT. Most of the cellular constituents of the ILT were in the luminal region and predominantly expressed markers of activated macrophages but also concurrently expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, CD105, and synthesized collagen I and III.\nThis report presents evidence for the presence of a distinct macrophage population within the luminal region of AAA ILT. These cells express a set of markers indicative of a unique population of activated macrophages. The exact contributions of these previously unrecognized cells to ILT formation and AAA pathobiology remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare renal outcomes (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] and renal volume) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open repair (OR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nAll AAA repairs performed between November 2009 and July 2011 were included in this retrospective study. Patients requiring suprarenal clamping and renal bypass or reimplantation and patients requiring fenestrated endografting were excluded from the OR and EVAR groups, respectively. All EVARs were performed with transrenal proximal fixation. Renal volume (calculated with a three-dimensional workstation) and GFR (estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) were evaluated before the procedure, at 12 months after the procedure, and yearly thereafter.\nThe study included 90 patients (41 ORs and 49 EVARs). Both groups were comparable except for age at intervention, body mass index, smoking, peripheral arterial disease, arrhythmia, and vitamin K antagonist treatment. Median follow-up was 2.8 years for OR (2.5-2.9 years) and 3.2 years for EVAR (3.0-3.4 years). In both groups, we found a significant decrease when comparing postoperative estimated GFR with 1-year (14.4% decrease [3.8%-23.8%]; P = .002) and 3-year (12.8% decrease [3.8%-20.9%]; P = .0007) levels. In both groups, total renal volumes significantly diminished. Median preoperative total renal volume (372 cm(3) [311-349]) significantly decreased (6.7% [2.8%-10.5%]; P = .008) between 1 year and 2 years of follow-up.\nRenal function impairment is similar after open and endovascular AAA repair. It is associated with a decrease in total renal volume, which seems to be an early and constant marker of postoperative renal impairment.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair has become increasingly popular the last years for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) and thoracic aortic aneurysms. EVAR is less invasive compared with the classic open approach, related to a decreased immediate postoperative morbidity and mortality. Those beneficial characteristics of EVAR do not come without a cost, since EVAR requires that the patient will be exposed to a significant amount of radiation during preoperative planning, graft placement, and consecutive follow-up. This systematic review examines the periprocedural radiation exposure to patients and staff as well as ways to ameliorate it.\nA systematic literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE electronic database. All articles reporting radiation exposure to alive humans during EVAR were eligible for review. Only studies publishing numerical data regarding radiation exposure were included in the Results section. Other relevant articles were used for further discussion.\nTwenty-four studies, both prospective and retrospective in nature, were included. These studies revealed that the radiation exposure depends on the specific type of procedure, with more complex procedures carrying greater radiation burden. Variations in the positioning and operating of the fluoroscopic unit may significantly alter radiation dose to both patients and staff. There was an apparent lack of education among vascular specialists and trainees in terms of radiation safety awareness. At follow-up, a significant number of patients needed additional procedures, and all required radiographic imaging, further increasing the radiation exposure to alarming levels.\nEvery effort should be made to decrease radiation exposure related to endovascular aortic procedures. Attempts must be directed towards maximizing the operator's awareness, welcoming new imaging technology emitting less radiation, and shifting to follow-up strategies that require minimal or no radiation.",

    "abstract": "Because Hispanic ethnicity in the United States is heterogeneous, the purpose of this study was to determine the epidemiology of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) within U.S. Hispanic/Latino groups defined by national background.\nThis analysis included 9648 men and women older than 45 years enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was computed as the higher of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis systolic blood pressures for each leg divided by the higher brachial artery systolic blood pressure. The index ABI was the higher of the two. An ABI \u22640.90 was the criterion for the presence of PAD.\nThe mean age was 56 years, and 55% were female. Overall, the prevalence of an ABI \u22640.90 (PAD), 0.90 to 0.99 (borderline), 1.0 to 1.39 (normal), and \u22651.40 (high) was 5.7%, 19.3%, 72.5%, and 2.6%, respectively. After multivariable adjustment for PAD risk factors and compared with Mexicans, Cubans had a nearly threefold higher odds for PAD (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.4). The odds of PAD for the other Hispanic/Latino groups ranged from 1.2 to 1.8. Although men had a more than threefold higher odds of an ABI \u22651.40 (3.6; 2.0-6.5), the odds did not differ significantly by Hispanic/Latino background.\nCompared with Mexican Americans, all other Hispanic/Latino background groups have a significantly higher odds of having PAD, with the odds being nearly threefold higher among Cubans.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy is the most effective treatment for reducing the risk of stroke in patients with significant carotid stenosis. Few studies have focused on the failure rate of regional anesthesia.\nData of all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (June 2009 to December 2014) in a single center were collected. Combined deep and superficial cervical plexus block or superficial plexus block alone was used according to the attending anesthesiologist's choice and the patient's characteristics (eg, dual antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy). Intraoperative remifentanil (0.025-0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min) was administered to maintain an adequate level of comfort, responsiveness, and cooperation. General anesthesia was planned only in the case of major contraindications or the patient's refusal of locoregional anesthesia. The primary end point of our study was the incidence of intraoperative conversion from locoregional to general anesthesia.\nA total of 2463 carotid endarterectomies were included in the analysis. Regional anesthesia was initially chosen in 2439 patients, whereas 24 patients received planned general anesthesia. In seven cases, regional anesthesia was converted to general anesthesia because of severe agitation of the patient (before clamping in four cases, after carotid clamping in two cases, and after declamping in one case). A shunt was used in 302 patients (12.3%) because of neurologic deterioration at the carotid clamping test. Intraoperative complications were emergent repeated surgical procedures in 13 cases (0.53%) because of acute neurologic deterioration, 1 intraoperative acute myocardial infarction (0.04%), and 3 cases (0.04%) of hemodynamically relevant supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. No intraoperative death occurred. In-hospital mortality was 0.12% (three patients). Major stroke occurred in 23 patients (0.93%); minor stroke occurred in 16 patients (0.65%). The combined stroke and death rate was 1.62% (40 patients).\nIn our practice, carotid endarterectomy under regional anesthesia is safe and associated with a very low rate of conversion to general anesthesia.",

PP was 75% in patients aged <60 years, 86% in patients aged 60-70 years, and 96% in patients aged >70 years, with a significant difference between all groups (P < .001). PP was significantly different for those with and without EIA occlusion (P = .002), with 1-year PP of 71% and 88%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Degenerative hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) are an uncommon pathologic process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the approach to and outcomes of operative management of HAA with open techniques (OTs) and endovascular techniques (ETs).\nTwenty-one patients who underwent intervention for HAA from January 1, 1992, to January 30, 2015, at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patient presentation, risk factors, and operative approach were reviewed. The primary outcome was operative morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes included long-term survival, patency, and need for reintervention.\nOf the 21 patients, 14 (67%) were men. The mean age of all patients was 66 years (range, 30-85 years), with a mean HAA size of 45 \u00b1 28 mm (12 common hepatic, 5 common and proper hepatic, 3 right hepatic, and 1 accessory left hepatic). Nine patients (43%) had connective tissue disorders. More than half of the patients (63%) had synchronous aneurysms (29% in the aorta, 24% in the splenic and iliac arteries, and 10% in the celiac arteries). Ten patients (48%) were asymptomatic. Right upper quadrant pain was the most common symptom at presentation (43%), followed by transaminitis (5%) and obstructive jaundice (5%). Five patients (24%) presented with rupture (size, 15-40 mm). OT was performed in 17 patients; 4 patients had ET. Fourteen patients (67%) underwent open reconstruction of the common hepatic (n = 10), the common and proper hepatic (n = 2), and the right and left accessory hepatic arteries (n = 1 each). Seven bypasses were performed with saphenous vein, six with Dacron, and one with polytetrafluoroethylene. Endoaneurysmorrhaphy alone, patch, and ligation were performed in one instance each. Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (29%), including hemorrhage, graft thrombosis, common bile duct stricture that required reoperation, duodenal perforation, and enterocutaneous fistula. ET was attempted in five patients; coil embolization was performed in four patients (two of the common and two of the right hepatic arteries). Overall mortality was 14% (6% after elective OT, 40% for emergency OT, 0% for ET). Mean follow-up was 32 \u00b1 46 months. Overall survival was 86% at 5 years. Primary and secondary graft patency was 86% at 5 years. One patient underwent reintervention because of occlusion of saphenous vein graft.\nOpen repair remains the mainstay treatment for degenerative HAA repairs to preserve arterial flow to the liver, with notable morbidity and mortality, particularly in the setting of rupture. However, coil embolization may be applied safely in select patients with aneurysms not involving the proper hepatic artery if adequate collateral circulation ensures hepatic perfusion.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was the evaluation of the clinical and radiologic outcomes of parallel grafts in the treatment of patients with failed prior endovascular aneurysm repair and type Ia endoleak.\nProspectively collected clinical and radiologic data of consecutive patients with prior endovascular aneurysm repair and evidence of type Ia endoleak were analyzed. All patients were treated between January 2009 and November 2014 by use of parallel grafts, ie, chimney/snorkel or periscope grafts and abdominal endovascular devices. Primary outcome of the study was the technical success. Secondary outcomes were patency of the chimney grafts and shrinkage of aneurysm morphology.\nTechnical success was 94.4% (17 of 18). One patient showed evidence of persistent type Ia endoleak after triple chimney graft placement and treated by Onyx embolization (Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) successfully. The mean preoperative and postoperative aneurysm diameters were 7.1 \u00b1 1.7 and 7.0 \u00b1 2 cm. Primary patency of the chimney grafts was 96.7% and assisted patency was 100% after successful retrograde recanalization of an acute occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery from the celiac trunk and the gastroduodenal artery. One patient who had undergone the sandwich technique with transfemoral placement of the flexible Viabahn (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) due to impossible catheterization of the target vessel from the upper extremity presented with contained rupture caused by gutter-associated endoleak and underwent urgent embolization with Onyx successfully. No procedure-related death or open conversion was observed in the entire follow-up period.\nUse of parallel grafts showed midterm safety and feasibility with low incidence of persistent endoleaks requiring intervention or progression of aneurysm diameter. Reproducible results from other vascular centers will establish the chimney technique in the treatment of type I endoleaks as a viable endovascular modality.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an established operation performed to prevent strokes, but its other potential effects, such as improving neurocognitive, visual, and auditory functions, remain unconfirmed. This study examined these effects of CEA on patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nThis was a prospective controlled study that included 80 patients with minor strokes who had severe extracranial internal carotid stenoses (>70%). Forty patients, who did not receive or who postponed the CEA due to concerns about age, fear of surgery, limited life expectancy because of cancer, or financial problems, formed the medicine-treatment group. Another 40 patients who received CEA 1 week after recruitment formed the CEA group. For both groups, visual acuity chart tests, perimetry tests, audiometry tests, and neurologic scales (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Mini Mental State Examination, and Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living) were used to assess ophthalmic functions, auditory acuity, and neurocognitive functions before treatment and 3 months after treatment. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons were conducted to examine the effect of CEA.\nNo deaths or strokes occurred during the 3-month follow-up. The intragroup and intergroup comparisons of ipsilateral function showed that CEA could improve visual acuity, visual field, and auditory acuity at all tested frequencies (250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz) and could improve the visual field and the auditory acuity for contralateral functions at 1000 Hz. The auditory acuity at 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz were unchanged in the intragroup comparison but showed no deterioration in the intergroup comparison with the medicine group. General neurocognitive function and independent living ability were significantly improved by CEA, as shown by intergroup comparisons (change rate of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: -8.1% \u00b1 9.0% vs -2.7% \u00b1 3.0%, P < .001; change rate of Mini Mental State Examination: 15.5% \u00b1 10.5% vs 1.6% \u00b1 2.6%, P < .001; change rate of Barthel Index: 28.0% \u00b1 24.6% vs 2.0% \u00b1 5.5%, P < .001).\nIn patients with minor strokes caused by severe carotid stenosis, CEA improves neurocognitive, ophthalmic, and acoustic functions. Studies with a larger sample and longer follow-up are needed to substantiate these results, and the underlying mechanisms need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Heart rate (HR) parameters are known indicators of cardiovascular complications after cardiac surgery, but there is little evidence of their role in predicting outcome after major vascular surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether arrival HR (AHR) and highest intraoperative HR are associated with mortality or major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) after elective vascular surgery in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI).\nPatients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass (LEB), aortofemoral bypass (AFB), and open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the VQI were analyzed. MACE was defined as any postoperative myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. Controlled HR was defined as AHR <75 beats/min on operating room arrival. Delta HR (DHR) was defined as highest intraoperative HR - AHR. Procedure-specific MACE models were derived for risk stratification, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustering of center effects. HR, beta-blocker exposure, cardiac risk, and their interactions were explored to determine association with MACE or 30-day mortality. A Bonferroni correction with P < .004 was used to declare significance.\nThere were 13,291 patients reviewed (LEB, n = 8155 [62%]; AFB, n = 2629 [18%]; open AAA, n = 2629 [20%]). Rates of any preoperative beta-blocker exposure were as follows: LEB, 66.5% (n = 5412); AFB, 57% (n = 1342); and open AAA, 74.2% (n = 1949). AHR and DHR outcome association was variable across patients and procedures. AHR <75 beats/min was associated with increased postoperative myocardial infarction risk for LEB patients across all risk strata (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.9; P = .03), whereas AHR <75 beats/min was associated with decreased dysrhythmia risk (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28-0.63; P = .0001) and 30-day death (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33-0.77; P = .001) in patients at moderate and high cardiac risk. These HR associations disappeared in controlling for beta-blocker status. For AFB and open AAA repair patients, there was no significant association between AHR and MACE or 30-day mortality, irrespective or cardiac risk or beta-blocker status. DHR and extremes of highest intraoperative HR (>90 or 100 beats/min) were analyzed among all three operations, and no consistent associations with MACE or 30-day mortality were detected.\nThe VQI AHR and highest intraoperative HR variables are highly confounded by patient presentation, operative variables, and beta-blocker therapy. The discordance between cardiac risk and HR as well as the lack of consistent correlation to outcome makes them unreliable predictors. The VQI has elected to discontinue collecting AHR and highest intraoperative HR data, given insufficient evidence to suggest their importance as an outcome measure.",

Rates of any preoperative beta-blocker exposure were as follows: LEB, 66.5% (n = 5412); AFB, 57% (n = 1342); and open AAA, 74.2% (n = 1949). AHR and DHR outcome association was variable across patients and procedures. AHR <75 beats/min was associated with increased postoperative myocardial infarction risk for LEB patients across all risk strata (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.9; P = .03), whereas AHR <75 beats/min was associated with decreased dysrhythmia risk (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28-0.63; P = .0001) and 30-day death (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33-0.77; P = .001) in patients at moderate and high cardiac risk. These HR associations disappeared in controlling for beta-blocker status. For AFB and open AAA repair patients, there was no significant association between AHR and MACE or 30-day mortality, irrespective or cardiac risk or beta-blocker status. DHR and extremes of highest intraoperative HR (>90 or 100 beats/min) were analyzed among all three operations, and no consistent associations with MACE or 30-day mortality were detected.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable controversy about the significance and appropriate treatment of type II endoleaks (T2Ls) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We report our long-term experience with T2L management in a large multicenter registry.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, 1736 patients underwent EVAR, and we recorded the incidence of T2L. Primary outcomes were mortality and aneurysm-related mortality (ARM). Secondary outcomes were change in aneurysm sac size, major adverse events, and reintervention.\nDuring the follow-up (median of 32.2 months; interquartile range, 14.2-52.8 months), T2L was identified in 474 patients (27.3%). There were no late abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures attributable to a T2L. Overall mortality (P = .47) and ARM (P = .26) did not differ between patients with and without T2L. Sac growth (median, 5 mm; interquartile range, 2-10 mm) was seen in 213 (44.9%) of the patients with T2L. Of these patients with a T2L and sac growth, 36 (16.9%) had an additional type of endoleak. Of all patients with T2L, 111 (23.4%) received reinterventions, including 39 patients who underwent multiple procedures; 74% of the reinterventions were performed in patients with sac growth. Reinterventions included lumbar embolization in 66 patients (59.5%), placement of additional stents in 48 (43.2%), open surgical revision in 14 (12.6%), and direct sac injection in 22 (19.8%). The reintervention was successful in 35 patients (31.5%). After patients with other types of endoleak were excluded, no difference in overall all-cause mortality (P = .57) or ARM (P = .09) was observed between patients with T2L-associated sac growth who underwent reintervention and those in whom T2L was left untreated.\nIn our multicenter EVAR registry, overall all-cause mortality and ARM were unaffected by the presence of a T2L. Moreover, patients who were simply observed for T2L-associated sac growth had aneurysm-related outcomes similar to those in patients who underwent reintervention. Our future work will investigate the most cost-effective ways to select patients for intervention besides sac growth alone.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for acute complicated type B aortic dissection (AD) promotes early positive aortic remodeling. However, little is known about the long-term effect of TEVAR on the dissected aorta, which is the goal of this study.\nBetween August 2005 and August 2009, 31 patients with complicated type B AD were treated with TEVAR and had >1-year follow-up imaging. Computed tomography angiograms obtained at 1 month, 1 year, and long term (average, 42 months) were compared with baseline scans. The largest diameters of the stented thoracic aorta, stented true lumen, and stented false lumen were recorded at each time point, as were the values in the unstented distal thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta. Changes over time were evaluated by a mixed effect analysis of variance model of repeated measures.\nThe average age of the cohort was 56 years, and 74% were male. Indications for TEVAR were as follows: 61% malperfusion, 32% refractory hypertension, 45% impending rupture, and 32% persistent pain; 58% had more than one indication. All patients were treated in the acute phase within 7 days of the initial presentation. The average length of aorta covered was 19 cm. Observation of the stented segment over time showed that the maximum diameter of the stented thoracic aorta was stable (P = NS), the diameter of the stented true lumen increased (P < .001), and the diameter of the stented false lumen decreased (P < .001); 84% had complete false lumen obliteration across the stented aortic segment. Observation of the uncovered thoracic aorta over time showed that the maximum diameter increased (P = .014), as did the visceral segment of the aorta (P < .001). The average growth of the visceral segment was 31% in patients with a patent false lumen vs 3% in those with a thrombosed false lumen (P = .004). One patient had aneurysmal degeneration of the false lumen and required an additional endograft at 18 months.\nTEVAR of acute AD promotes long-term remodeling across the stented segment, with false lumen obliteration in 84% of patients. However, false lumen obliteration beyond the stented segment appears necessary to prevent late aneurysmal degeneration of the distal aorta.",

    "abstract": "In thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), a paradigm shift is observed from open surgery toward total endovascular aortic repair using fenestrated and branched endografts. Whereas outcome after open replacement in terms of mortality and paraplegia has been evaluated extensively, no studies exist addressing long-term patency of visceral and renal vessels. To enable comparison of target vessel patency between open and endovascular treatment, we analyzed our series of open TAAA replacements.\nOur vascular surgery database was screened for patients who received open TAAA replacement between 1998 and 2012, and patient records were analyzed retrospectively. All available imaging scans (computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography: preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up) were evaluated for graft and vessel patency.\nWe identified 62 patients (mean age, 66 \u00b1 10 years; 40 men) who had been operated on for aneurysms of Crawford types I (8), II (13), III (13), and IV (24) and Safi type V (4). A total of 181 vessels were revascularized by either patch inclusion (n = 147) or selective revascularization (bypass or transposition, n = 34); 48 survived the procedure, resulting in a number of vessels available for follow-up of 154 (patch, 126; selective revascularization, 28). The respective patency rates for overall, patch, and selective revascularization were 95.2%, 94.2%, and 100% at 5 years and 83.7%, 81.3%, and 100% at 10 years, respectively. In addition, a trend for better performance of selective revascularization (bypass or transposition) was evident as all vessel occlusions were observed in cases of patch inclusion, whereas all selectively revascularized vessels were patent. The respective patency rates for the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and left and right renal artery were 100%, 97.5%, 92.3%, and 90.3% at 5 years.\nIn our series of open thoracoabdominal aortic replacement, excellent patency rates for revascularized renal and visceral vessels were observed during long-term follow-up. We were able to provide a reference value of long-term target vessel patency that can and should be taken into account to judge the efficacy of endovascular repair in TAAA.",

    "abstract": "Significant hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can lead to thrombosis, with subsequent liver failure in 30% of patients. Although operative intervention or retransplantation has been the traditional solution, endovascular therapy has emerged as a less invasive treatment strategy. Prior smaller studies have been conflicting in the relative efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) vs primary stent placement for HAS.\nThis was a single-center retrospective review of all endovascular interventions for HAS after OLT during a 54-month period (August 2009-December 2013). Patients with ultrasound imaging with evidence of severe HAS (peak systolic velocity >400-450 cm/s, resistive index <0.5) underwent endovascular treatment with primary stent placement or PTA. Outcomes calculated were technical success, primary and primary assisted patency rates, reinterventions, and complications.\nSixty-two interventions for HAS were performed in 42 patients with a mean follow-up of 19.1 \u00b1 15.2 months. During the study period, 654 OLTs were performed. Of 61 patients diagnosed with HAS, 42 underwent an endovascular intervention. The rate of endovascularly treated HAS was 6.4% (42 of 654). Primary technical success was achieved in 95% (59 of 62) of the interventions. Initial treatment was with PTA alone in 17 or primary stent in 25. Primary patency rates after initial stent placement were 87%, 76.5%, 78%, and 78% at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, compared with initial PTA rates of 64.7%, 53.3%, 40%, and 0% (P = .19). There were 20 reinterventions in 14 patients (eight stents, six PTAs). The time to the initial reintervention was 51 days in patients with PTA alone vs 105.8 days for those with an initial stent (P = .16). Overall primary assisted patency was 93% at 24 months. Major complications were one arterial rupture and two hepatic artery dissections. The long-term risk of hepatic artery thrombosis in the entire patient cohort was 3.2%.\nHAS after OLT can be treated endovascularly with high technical success and excellent primary assisted patency. This series represents the largest reported cohort of endovascular interventions for HAS to date. Initial use of a stent showed a strong trend toward decreasing the need for reintervention. Avoidance of hepatic artery thrombosis is possible in >95% of patients with endovascular treatment and close follow-up.",

Of 61 patients diagnosed with HAS, 42 underwent an endovascular intervention. The rate of endovascularly treated HAS was 6.4% (42 of 654). Primary technical success was achieved in 95% (59 of 62) of the interventions. Initial treatment was with PTA alone in 17 or primary stent in 25. Primary patency rates after initial stent placement were 87%, 76.5%, 78%, and 78% at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, compared with initial PTA rates of 64.7%, 53.3%, 40%, and 0% (P = .19). There were 20 reinterventions in 14 patients (eight stents, six PTAs). The time to the initial reintervention was 51 days in patients with PTA alone vs 105.8 days for those with an initial stent (P = .16). Overall primary assisted patency was 93% at 24 months. Major complications were one arterial rupture and two hepatic artery dissections. The long-term risk of hepatic artery thrombosis in the entire patient cohort was 3.2%.",

    "abstract": "Whereas carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the \"gold standard\" treatment, given its low complication rate, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a valid alternative in patients with prohibitive surgical risks. However, the application of CAS has been scrutinized, given its increased perioperative risk in comparison to CEA. Operators follow general guidelines in intraoperative techniques in CAS. However, few of those are evidence based. We believe that a specific outcome-driven examination of the effect of pre- and poststent deployment ballooning is warranted. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of prestent ballooning (pre-SB) and poststent ballooning (post-SB) on hemodynamic depression (HD) and perioperative stroke or death.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who had CAS between 2005 and 2014 in the Vascular Quality Initiative database. Logistic regression analyses of the effect of different pre-SB and post-SB combinations on HD and the 30-day stroke and death rate were performed. We excluded patients who had no protection device, those with isolated common carotid artery lesions, and those who had no ballooning at all. The models controlled for patient age, gender, comorbidities, smoking status, symptomatic status, history of previous ipsilateral CEA, preoperative medications, and ipsilateral degree of stenosis.\nA total of 3772 patients who underwent CAS were included for analysis. Average age of patients was 69.8 \u00b1 9.6 years, with 63% being male. The overall perioperative stroke and death rate was 3.0%. Compared with pre-SB only technique, the combined pre-SB and post-SB technique had a 2.1-fold increase in HD (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-3.01; P < .001) and 2.4-fold increase in perioperative stroke and death rate (odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-5.62; P < .050).\nCompared with pre-SB alone, the use of post-SB increases the chances of perioperative HD and stroke and death rate in patients undergoing CAS. Post-SB should be used only in those cases with severe residual stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Complex aortic aneurysms are now being repaired by endovascular techniques, albeit with a potentially increased risk of lower limb ischemia-reperfusion injury. We report a simple technique to maintain perfusion to the lower limb during endovascular repair, using one additional introducer sheath placed antegrade, distal to the stent graft introduction site, and connected to the side arm of the working sheath in the contralateral artery. This allows continuous perfusion of the limb distal to the main stent graft introduction site. In our initial experience with 12 cases, with confirmed occlusion of the native arterial system by the stent graft introducer sheath, arterial occlusion time was 165 \u00b1 84 minutes. Use of the sheath-shunt technique resulted in pulsatile flow in all cases, with an average flow of 42.2 \u00b1 13.2 mL/min, and actual ischemia time was reduced to 14 \u00b1 11 minutes. There were no complications related to the use of this technique. Given the limited risk of this technique coupled with a potential benefit, we propose its consideration in patients undergoing complex endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication (PAD-IC) negatively affects physical activity and function. There is evidence for plantarflexor muscle dysfunction and weakness; however, the extent to which this dysfunction can be attributed to reduced muscle size or quality, or both, is not yet known. This study investigated whether in vivo plantarflexor muscle quality during static and dynamic contractions is altered by PAD-IC and whether such changes are associated with impaired walking endurance according to initial and absolute claudication distances.\nThe study recruited 22 participants, consisting of 10 healthy controls and 12 claudicant patients with occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (seven unilateral and five bilateral). Muscle quality of the combined gastrocnemius muscles during static contractions was calculated by normalizing the estimated maximal potential muscle force to the physiological cross-sectional area of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius. Muscle quality during dynamic contractions of the combined plantarflexor muscles was calculated as the ratio of peak voluntary concentric plantarflexor power and the summed volume of lateral and medial gastrocnemius.\nDynamic muscle quality was 24% lower in the claudicating-limb and asymptomatic-limb groups compared with controls (P = .017 and P = .023). The differences were most apparent at the highest contraction velocity (180\u00b0/s). Dynamic muscle quality was associated with reduced walking endurance (R = 0.689, P = .006 and R = 0.550, P = .042 for initial and absolute claudication distance, respectively). The claudicating-limb group demonstrated a trend toward reduced static muscle quality compared with controls (22%, P = .084). The relative contribution of the soleus muscle to plantarflexion maximum voluntary contraction was significantly higher in the claudicating-limb and asymptomatic-limb groups than in controls (P = .012 and P = .018).\nThe muscle strength of the plantarflexors in those with PAD-IC appears to be impaired at high contraction velocities. This may be explained by some reduction in gastrocnemii muscle quality and a greater reliance on the prominently type I-fibered soleus muscle. The reduced dynamic capability of the plantarflexor muscles was associated with disease severity and walking ability; therefore, efforts to improve plantarflexor power through dynamic exercise intervention are vital to maintain functional performance.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has been performed by various surgical specialties for many years. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) may be a disruptive technology, having an impact on which specialties care for patients with AAA. Therefore, we examined the proportion of AAA repairs performed by various specialties over time in the United States and evaluated the impact of the introduction of EVAR.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001-2009) was queried for intact and ruptured AAA and for open repair and EVAR. Specific procedures were used to identify vascular surgeons (VSs), cardiac surgeons (CSs), and general surgeons (GSs) as well as interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists for states that reported unique treating physician identifiers. Annual procedure volumes were subsequently calculated for each specialty.\nWe identified 108,587 EVARs and 85,080 open AAA repairs (3011 EVARs and 12,811 open repairs for ruptured AAA). VSs performed an increasing proportion of AAA repairs during the study period (52% in 2001 to 66% in 2009; P < .001). GSs and CSs performed fewer repairs during the same period (25% to 17% [P < .001] and 19% to 13% [P < .001], respectively). EVAR was increasingly used for intact (33% to 78% of annual cases; P < .001) as well as ruptured AAA repair (5% to 28%; P < .001). The proportion of intact open repairs performed by VSs increased from 52% to 65% (P < .001), whereas for EVAR, the proportion went from 60% to 67% (P < .001). The proportion performed by VSs increased for ruptured open repairs from 37% to 53% (P < .001) and for ruptured EVARs from 28% to 73% (P < .001). Compared with treatment by VSs, treatment by a CS (0.55 [0.53-0.56]) and GS (0.66 [0.64-0.68]) was associated with a decreased likelihood of undergoing endovascular rather than open AAA repair.\nVSs are performing an increasing majority of AAA repairs, in large part driven by the increased utilization of EVAR for both intact and ruptured AAA repair. However, GSs and CSs still perform AAA repair. Further studies should examine the implications of these national trends on the outcome of AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that venous claudication is significantly more common among patients with Beh\u00e7et's disease (BD) and had proposed that this was a \"venous claudication\" because it was specifically more common among men with lower extremity venous thrombosis (LEVT). With this study, we reassessed the presence of claudication prospectively by a questionnaire and a treadmill exercise.\nWe studied all men: 61 BD patients with LEVT, 40 BD patients without vascular involvement, and 56 healthy controls. Venous claudication was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. In addition, patients were asked to walk on a treadmill for 10 minutes. Patients who experienced symptoms consistent with venous claudication but still able to walk and those who had to give up the treadmill exercise were noted. Ankle-brachial pressure indices measured before and after the treadmill test did not indicate any peripheral arterial disease.\nTwenty-one BD patients with LEVT (34%), two BD patients without vascular involvement (5%), and none of the healthy controls described venous claudication when assessed with the questionnaire (P < .001). There were significantly more patients who described claudication during the treadmill exercise among patients with LEVT (21%) compared with those with no vascular disease (8%) and healthy controls (2%) (P = .002). Finally, only those with LEVT (6 of 61) had to stop the treadmill challenge because of claudication.\nVenous claudication is a severe and frequent symptom, being present in up to one third of BD patients with LEVT. It impairs walking capacity in 10% of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Autologous grafts are used to repair atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases; however, many patients lack suitable donor graft tissue. Recently, tissue engineering techniques have emerged to make biologically active blood vessels. We applied this technique to produce arterial grafts using established biodegradable materials without cell seeding. The grafts were evaluated in vivo for vessel remodeling during 12 months.\nPoly(L-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) scaffolds reinforced by poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fiber were prepared as arterial grafts. Twenty-eight cell-free grafts were implanted as infrarenal aortic interposition grafts in 8-week-old female SCID/Bg mice. Serial ultrasound and micro computed tomography angiography were used to monitor grafts after implantation. Five grafts were harvested for histologic assessments and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis at time points ranging from 4 months to 1 year after implantation.\nMicro computed tomography indicated that most implanted mice displayed aneurysmal changes (three of five mice at 4 months, four of five mice at 8 months, and two of five mice at 12 months). Histologic assessments demonstrated extensive tissue remodeling leading to the development of well-circumscribed neovessels with an endothelial inner lining, a neointima containing smooth muscle cells and elastin, and a collagen-rich extracellular matrix. There were a few observed calcified deposits, located around residual PLA fibers at 12 months after implantation. Macrophage infiltration into the scaffold, as evaluated by F4/80 immunohistochemical staining, remained after 12 months and was focused mostly around residual PLA fibers. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that gene expression of Itgam, a marker for macrophages, and of matrix metalloproteinase 9 was higher than in native aorta during the course of 12 months, indicating prolonged inflammation (Itgam at 8 months: 11.75 \u00b1 0.99 vs native aorta, P < .01; matrix metalloproteinase 9 at 4 months: 4.35 \u00b1 3.05 vs native aorta, P < .05).\nIn this study, we demonstrated well-organized neotissue of cell-free biodegradable arterial grafts. Although most grafts experienced aneurysmal change, such findings provide insight into the process of tissue-engineered vascular graft remodeling and should allow informed rational design of the next generation of arterial grafts.",

    "abstract": "Venous function is underappreciated in its role in blood pressure determination, a physiologic parameter normally ascribed to changes in arterial function. Significant evidence points to the hormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) as being important to venous contributions to blood pressure. We hypothesized that the artery and vein should similarly depend on the signaling pathways stimulated by ET-1, specifically phospholipase C (PLC) activation. This produces two functional arms of signaling: diacylglycerol (DAG; protein kinase C [PKC] activation) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production (intracellular calcium release).\nThe model was the male Sprague-Dawley rat. Isolated tissue baths were used to measure isometric contraction. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses measured the magnitude of expression and site of expression, respectively, of IP3 receptors in smooth muscle/tissue. Pharmacologic methods were used to modify PLC activity and signaling elements downstream of PLC (IP3 receptors, PKC).\nET-1-induced contraction was PLC dependent in both tissues as the PLC inhibitor U-73122 significantly reduced contraction in aorta (86% \u00b1 4% of control; P < .05) and vena cava (49% \u00b1 11% of control; P < .05). However, ET-1-induced contraction was not significantly inhibited by the IP3 receptor inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (100 \u03bcM) in vena cava (82% \u00b1 8% of control; P = .23) but was in the aorta (55% \u00b1 4% of control; P < .05). All three IP3 receptor isoforms were located in venous smooth muscle. IP3 receptors were functional in both tissues as the novel membrane-permeable IP3 analogue (Bt-IP3; 10 \u03bcM) contracted aorta and vena cava. Similarly, whereas the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (10 \u03bcM) attenuated ET-1-induced contraction in vena cava and aorta (5% \u00b1 2% and 50% \u00b1 5% of control, respectively; P < .05), only the vena cava contracted to the DAG analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol.\nThese findings suggest that ET-1 activates PLC in aorta and vena cava, but vena cava contraction to ET-1 may be largely IP3 independent. Rather, DAG\u2014not IP3\u2014may contribute to contraction to ET-1 in vena cava, in part by activation of PKC. These studies outline a fundamental difference between venous and arterial smooth muscle and further reinforce a heterogeneity of vascular smooth muscle function that could be taken advantage of for therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in intravascular stent technology, safe prevention of stent thrombosis over prolonged periods after initial deployment persists as a medical need to decrease device failure. The objective of this project was to assess the potential of perfluorocarbon nanoparticles (NP) conjugated with the direct thrombin inhibitor D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethylketone (PPACK-NP) to inhibit stent thrombosis.\nIn a static model of stent thrombosis, 3\u00a0\u00d7 3-mm pieces of stainless steel coronary stents were cut and adsorbed with thrombin to create a procoagulant surface that would facilitate thrombus development. After treatment with PPACK-NP or control NP, stents were exposed to platelet-poor plasma (PPP) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for set time points up to 60\u00a0minutes. Measurements of final clot weight in grams were used for assessing the effect of NP treatment on limiting thrombosis. Additionally, groups of stents were exposed to flowing plasma containing various treatments (saline, free PPACK, control NP, and PPACK-NP) and generated thrombi were stained and imaged to investigate the treatment effects of PPACK-NP under flow conditions.\nThe static model of stent thrombosis used in this study indicated a significant reduction in thrombus deposition with PPACK-NP treatment (0.00067\u00a0\u00b1 0.00026\u00a0g; n\u00a0= 3) compared with control NP (0.0098\u00a0\u00b1 0.0015\u00a0g; n\u00a0= 3; P\u00a0= .026) in PPP. Exposure to PRP demonstrated similar effects with PPACK-NP treatment (0.00033\u00a0\u00b1 0.00012\u00a0g; n\u00a0= 3) vs control NP treatment (0.0045\u00a0\u00b1 0.00012\u00a0g; n\u00a0= 3; P\u00a0= .000017). In additional studies, stents were exposed to both PRP pretreated with vorapaxar and PPACK-NP, which illustrated adjunctive benefit to oral platelet inhibitors for prevention of stent thrombosis. Additionally, an in\u00a0vitro model of stent thrombosis under flow conditions established that PPACK-NP treatment inhibited thrombus deposition on stents significantly.\nThis study demonstrates that antithrombin perfluorocarbon NPs exert marked focal antithrombin activity to prevent intravascular stent thrombosis and occlusion.",

    "abstract": "The production of growth factors from several experimental arterial conduits was determined.\nWe implanted 105 experimental arterial grafts that were 1\u00a0cm long in the abdominal aorta of Lewis rats (average weight, 250\u00a0g). Five different types of grafts were analyzed: arterial isografts, vein grafts, arterial allografts, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts with normal or decreased compliance. Animals were killed humanely 4\u00a0weeks after surgery and the production of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-1 was analyzed.\nMyointimal hyperplasia (MH) was evident in vein grafts, arterial allografts, and PTFE grafts, but not in arterial isografts. Growth factor production was increased for grafts prone to develop MH like vein, PTFE grafts, and arterial allografts. PDGF and bFGF were increased significantly for PTFE and vein grafts, but not for arterial allografts. The importance of bFGF and PGDF was confirmed by the capability of antibody to PDGF and to bFGF to reduce the mitogenic activity of smooth muscle cells, in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro, for PTFE and vein grafts, but not for arterial allografts, in which a predominant role was played by interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1.\nAgents able to neutralize this increased production of growth factors, either directly or by competition with their receptors, can prevent MH formation.",

From 416 procedures, 47 SBAVFs and 77 WAVFs with vessels suitable for a SBAVF were selected.\nAlthough vessel diameters used for construction of the SBAVFs were smaller than those used for WAVFs, the outcome of vascular access was similar. At 18 months, primary patency was 72% for SBAVF and 65% for WAVF (P = .48), and secondary patency was 93% for SBAVF and 94% for WAVF (P = .89).\nIn our experience, a SBAVF performs as well as a WAVF up to 18 months after creation.

The long-term results, which included the anatomic occlusion rate, varicose vein recurrence at the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ), relief of venous symptoms and QoL, were compared up to 5 years after treatment.\nA total of 130 legs of 121 patients were treated with either SFL/S (n = 68) or EVLA (n = 62). In the first 12 months, three recanalizations of the GSV were observed after EVLA. Up to 5 years later, more recurrent varicose veins caused by neoreflux in incompetent tributaries of the SFJ were observed in after EVLA (31%; 19/61) compared with SFL/S (7%; 4/60; P < .01). Neovascularization in the groin with clinically visible recurrence identified at 3 and 5 years post-treatment follow-up was only observed in the SFL/S group (n = 6). After 5 years, clinically visible recurrences originating from the SFJ region after EVLA were observed 33% (20/61) compared with 17% of patients (10/60) after SFL/S (P < .04). In both treatment groups, venous symptoms improved significantly. Patients in both groups reported a continuing significant cosmetic improvement measured on a visual analog scale of 1 to 10 (mean, 7.49; P < .01). There was no difference in the CEAP staging and a standardized, non-disease-specific instrument for describing and valuing health states (EuroQol-5D), between the groups up to 5 years after follow-up.\nAt the 5-year follow-up, a significantly higher varicose vein recurrence rate originated at the SFJ region after EVLA compared with SFL/S.

    "abstract": "Groin wound infection is a costly and morbid event after lower extremity revascularization. To date, a comprehensive and validated method for identifying patients who are at greatest risk for this complication has yet to be developed.\nOur retrospective analysis included all patients at a single institution who underwent lower extremity revascularization using a groin incision from 2009 through 2012. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a test group, which was used to develop a predictive model for our primary outcome; and a validation group, which was used to test that model. The primary outcome for our analysis was severe groin wound infection, which we defined as postoperative groin infection that required operative intervention. Multimodel inference methods were used to evaluate all possible combinations, interactions, and transformations of potential predictor variables from the test group of patients. The resulting model that exhibited the lowest Akaike information criterion was then selected for testing with the validation group of patients.\nA total of 284 patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization procedures were included in our study (140 in the test group, 144 in the validation group). In the test group, 17 patients (12.1%) developed severe groin wound infection requiring operative intervention. The best-fit predictive model developed from this group identified the following independent risk factors for severe groin wound infection: prior ipsilateral groin incision, female gender, body mass index, end-stage renal disease, malnutrition, and urgent or emergency procedure status. The correct classification rate of this model in the test group was 88.6%. The incidence of severe groin wound infection in the validation group was 13.9%, and application of our predictive model to this group yielded a correct classification rate of 86.1%.\nWe have developed and validated a statistical model that accurately predicts those patients who are likely to sustain severe groin wound infection after lower extremity revascularization.",

The best-fit predictive model developed from this group identified the following independent risk factors for severe groin wound infection: prior ipsilateral groin incision, female gender, body mass index, end-stage renal disease, malnutrition, and urgent or emergency procedure status. The correct classification rate of this model in the test group was 88.6%. The incidence of severe groin wound infection in the validation group was 13.9%, and application of our predictive model to this group yielded a correct classification rate of 86.1%.",

    "abstract": "Proper selection of patients for carotid artery stenting (CAS) remains controversial despite multiple controlled trials. This relates in part to differences in interpretation of the relative importance of myocardial vs stroke complications after the procedure by different specialties and a lack of granular clinical data to analyze outcomes outside the large clinical trials. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of preoperative medications, procedure parameters, and patient characteristics on outcomes of CAS performed in a multispecialty national database.\nWe analyzed all patients who underwent CAS between 2005 and 2014 in the Vascular Quality Initiative. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to assess the effects of age, gender, comorbidities, smoking, preprocedure medications, procedure details, and hypotension or hypertension that required intravenous medication on 30-day death or stroke rates.\nA total of 5263 patients underwent CAS (mean age, 70 years; 63% male). The 30-day stroke/death rate was 3.4% (1.5% minor stroke, 0.9% major stroke, and 1.2% death; 40% of patients who had major strokes died within 30 days), and the myocardial infarction rate was 0.8%. Postprocedural hypertension requiring treatment occurred in 519 cases (9.9%), and it was associated with a 3.4-fold increase in stroke/death (odds ratio, 3.39; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-5.00; P < .0001). Preprocedural beta-blocker use for >30 days was associated with a 34% reduction in the stroke/death risk (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.95; P = .025) compared with nonuse. Beta-blocker use was not associated with postprocedural hypotension. Other predictors of postoperative stroke and death included age, symptomatic status, diabetes (type 1 or type 2), and postprocedural hypotension, whereas prior carotid endarterectomy and distal embolic protection use were protective.\nPostprocedural hypertension and hypotension that require treatment are both strongly associated with periprocedural stroke/death after CAS. Beta blockers significantly reduce the stroke/death risk associated with carotid stenting and should be investigated prospectively for potential use during CAS.",

    "abstract": "Time spent in sedentary behavior has been associated with worse inflammation and cardiometabolic biomarkers in various populations. However, the association between time spent in sedentary behavior and biomarkers remains unknown in patients with intermittent claudication. The aim of the current study was to analyze the relationship between sedentary behavior and inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nThe sample included 297 patients with intermittent claudication. Sedentary behavior was assessed using a step activity monitor. Biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and endogenous fibrinolysis were assessed. Demographic data, body mass index, physical activity status, and measures of severity of PAD (ankle-brachial index, peak walking time, and ischemic window) also were obtained.\nTime spent in sedentary behavior was related with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (b = 0.187; P = .005), glucose (b = 0.238; P < .001), fibrinogen (b = 0.167; P = .017), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity (b = 0.143; P = .036), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (b = -0.133; P = .029). After adjustment for sex, age, physical activity status, body mass index, and severity of PAD, sedentary behavior remained related with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (b = 0.170; P = .015), glucose (b = 0.178; P = .004), fibrinogen (b = 0.189; P = .010), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (b = -0.128; P = .032).\nTime spent in sedentary activities was associated with worse inflammatory and cardiometabolic profile in patients with intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "The role of hybrid repair in the management of aortic arch pathology, and long-term outcomes with these techniques, remains uncertain. We report a decade of experience with hybrid arch repair (HAR) and assess institutional practice patterns with regard to the use of hybrid and open techniques.\nHybrid and open total and distal arch procedures performed between July 2005 and January 2015 were identified from a prospectively maintained, institutional aortic surgery database. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, freedom from reintervention, and long-term survival were calculated. Hybrid and open procedural volumes over the study period were assessed to evaluate for potential practice pattern changes.\nDuring the study period 148 consecutive procedures were performed for repair of transverse and distal aortic arch pathology, including 101 hybrid repairs and 47 open total or distal arch repairs. Patients in the hybrid repair group were significantly older with a greater incidence of chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Perioperative mortality and outcomes were not significantly different between the hybrid and open groups, aside from decreased median length of stay after hybrid repair. Need for subsequent reintervention was significantly greater after hybrid repair. Unadjusted long-term survival was superior after open repair (70% 5-year survival open vs 47% hybrid; P = .03), although aorta-specific survival was similar (98% 5-year aorta-specific survival open vs 93% hybrid; P = .59). Institutional use of HAR decreased over the final 3 years of the study, with an associated increased use of open total or distal arch repairs. This was primarily the result of decreased use of native zone 0 hybrid procedures. Concurrent with this apparent increased stringency around patient selection for HAR, perioperative morbidity and mortality was reduced, including avoidance of retrograde type A dissection.\nHAR remains a viable option for higher-risk patients with transverse arch pathology with perioperative outcomes and long-term aorta-specific survival similar to open repair, albeit at a cost of increased reintervention. This observational single-institution study would suggest decreased use in more recent years in favor of open repair due to avoidance of native zone 0 hybrid procedures. This decline in the institutional use of native zone 0 hybrid repairs was associated with improved perioperative outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Higher lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been linked with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Also, elevated Lp(a) serum levels have been observed in women and African Americans (AAs). It remains uncertain if sex and ethnicity modify the association between Lp(a) and PAD.\nLp(a) mass concentration was measured with a latex-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay, from blood collected at baseline clinic visits after a 12-hour fast, in a multiethnic cohort. Also at baseline, the ankle-brachial index was measured. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index <1.0. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine sex and ethnic differences in associations of log-transformed Lp(a) and the presence of PAD.\nIn 4618 participants, the mean age was 62 \u00b1 10 years; Lp(a) mean was 30 \u00b1 32 mg/dL and median (interquartile range) was 18 (8-40 mg/dL); 48% were male; 36% were European American, 29% were AA, 23% were Hispanic American (HA), and 12% were Chinese American; and 11% had PAD. Across all ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) was higher among women compared with men and highest among AAs compared with other ethnicities. After adjustments for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors (age, sex, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) as well as interleukin-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and homocysteine levels, one log unit increase in Lp(a) was associated with greater odds for PAD (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.25). In fully adjusted models, significant gender(\u2217)ln[Lp(a)] and ethnicity(\u2217)ln[Lp(a)] interactions were observed (P = .08 for both). The association between higher Lp(a) and PAD was strongest in HA men (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.07-2.80) and HA women (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07-2.08). Nonsignificant associations were observed for European American, AA, and Chinese American men and women.\nWe observed a significant and independent association between elevated Lp(a) and PAD only among HA women and men, despite higher serum Lp(a) levels among AAs. Future studies are needed to determine the role that lowering of Lp(a) may have on the burden of PAD in HAs.",

Across all ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) was higher among women compared with men and highest among AAs compared with other ethnicities. After adjustments for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors (age, sex, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) as well as interleukin-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and homocysteine levels, one log unit increase in Lp(a) was associated with greater odds for PAD (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.25). In fully adjusted models, significant gender(\u2217)ln[Lp(a)] and ethnicity(\u2217)ln[Lp(a)] interactions were observed (P = .08 for both). The association between higher Lp(a) and PAD was strongest in HA men (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.07-2.80) and HA women (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07-2.08).

    "abstract": "The treatment of segmental arteriovenous fistula aneurysms (AVFAs) remains a challenge in dialysis access preservation. We examined our experience with the use of tubularized extracellular matrix (ECM; CorMatrix, Roswell, Ga) for AVFA repair.\nBetween October 2013 and January 2015, we conducted a prospective study of CorMatrix ECM for AVFA repair. All patients underwent intraoperative fistulography. Patients with central venous stenosis or occlusion had simultaneous angioplasty and stenting as indicated. The aneurysm and overlying skin were then resected, and an ECM patch was fashioned into a tube for interposition repair. Patients with multiple AVFAs underwent staged repair. Cannulation of the repaired segments was allowed after 6 weeks.\nDuring the study period, 15 patients (40% male; mean age, 49.5 years) underwent 18 AVFA repairs using ECM (3 staged repairs). Six patients (40%) underwent simultaneous treatment of central vein lesions, whereas eight patients (53%) had associated skin erosion. Treated sites included radiocephalic (2), brachiobasilic (1), and brachiocephalic (15) AVFAs. All patients had hemodialysis at an alternative location on the same extremity without the need for catheter placement. Five patients underwent a follow-up ultrasound examination at a mean of 6 weeks. All studies demonstrated patency of the ECM segments without stenosis. At a mean follow-up time of 6.9 months, two thrombosis events were observed, both in patients with known refractory central venous stenosis treated with previous angioplasty (2) and stenting (1). Both patients required new access placement. No complications were attributable to ECM sites.\nECM is an alternative conduit for salvage of an autologous AVFA. This technique may help avoid the use of prosthetic grafts and hemodialysis catheters. Patients with associated central venous stenosis are at risk of thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are novel markers of endothelial dysfunction and are related to cardiovascular disease. However, their relationship with cerebral atherosclerosis (CA) has not been investigated extensively. We aim to study the relationship between CA severity and EPC subpopulations levels.\nWe enrolled 197 patients in this study. EPCs were measured by flow cytometry. Digital subtraction angiography was used to assess CA. Arterial lesion severity was evaluated among cerebral arteries which showed steno-occlusion change and the extent of that condition.\nThere was a significant inverse correlation between EPCs level and CA prevalence after adjusting for confounders (CD45(-/dim)CD34(+)CD309(+) cells: odds ratio [OR], 0.110; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.026-0.475; P = .00; CD45(-/dim)CD133(+)CD309(+) cells: OR, 0.134; 95% CI, 0.030-0.599; P = .01; CD45(-/dim) CD34(+)CD133(+)CD309(+) cells: OR, 0.010; 95% CI, 0.001-0 .541, P = .02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the EPCs level was significantly inversely associated with extracranial atherosclerosis rather than intracranial atherosclerosis (P > .05).\nOur data indicated that EPCs subpopulations were independent predictors for CA severity, even after controlling for traditional risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Improved trends in patient survival and decreased major complications after emergency ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Emergency AAA repair carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. This study seeks to examine morbidity and mortality trends from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, and identify potential risk factors.\nAll emergency AAA repairs were identified using the NSQIP database from 2005 to 2011. Univariate analysis (using the Student t, \u03c7(2), and Fisher's exact tests) and multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine trends in mortality and morbidity.\nOut of 2761 patients who underwent emergency AAA repair, 321 (11.6%) died within 24 hours of surgery. Of the remaining 2440 patients, 1133 (46.4%) experienced major complications and 459 (18.8%) died during the postoperative period. From 2005 to 2011, there was a significant decrease in patient mortality, particularly in patients who survived the perioperative period (P = .002). Total complications increased overall (P < .0001); however, major complications decreased from 58.7% in 2005 to 42.6% in 2011 (P < .0001) among patients who survived beyond 24 hours. The use of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) increased over the study period (P < .0001). On multivariate analysis of patients who survived past the initial 24-hour period, advancing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-4.1), dependent functional status (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and presence of a major complication (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.0-5.0) were significantly associated with death, whereas presence of a senior resident (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6) or fellow (OR 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6) was inversely associated with death. EVAR was not associated with death, but was associated with 30-day complications (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6).\nPatient survival has increased from 2005 to 2011 after emergency AAA repair, with a significant improvement particularly in patients who survive past the first 24 hours. EVAR was not associated with mortality, but was protective of 30-day complications. Although the total number of complications increased, the number of major complications decreased over the study period, suggesting that newer techniques and patient care protocols may be improving outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Among Basque handball players, the repeated impact of a ball on the palms of their hands hundreds of thousands of times throughout their sporting careers produces Raynaud syndrome. Treating this patient group is complex. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of digital periarterial sympathectomy in this patient group.\nThe study included all of the federated amateur and professional Basque handball patients who presented with Raynaud syndrome assessed in the vascular surgery service between January 2005 and December 2012. The postoperative assessment included a physical examination, basal photoplethysmography and photoplethysmography after heat hyperemia, and arteriography or magnetic resonance angiography.\nAll 182 digital periarterial sympathectomies in the 114 fingers of 60 patients were in Porter functional class III or IV. All patients were discharged within the first 48 hours. Follow-up results, with a mean of 2 years \u00b1 5 months, were 100%. All patients presented immediate pain remission, recovery of comfort, normal nail growth, rapid healing of all ulcers, distal anhidrosis, and return to active sport participation. The results remain steady in 58 patients (93.5%). Mean time until return to sports activity was 9.95 \u00b1 1.61 weeks.\nDigital periarterial sympathectomy is a simple, relatively nonaggressive technique without adverse side effects and with excellent medium-term results. In patients with Raynaud syndrome refractory to medical treatment and with threat to the viability of one or several fingers, digital periarterial sympathectomy can be the first treatment option, especially in cases of arteritis associated with very severe spasms.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of total percutaneous endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (PEVAR) with a single Perclose ProGlide device (Abbot Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif) compared with endovascular aortic repair with surgical cutdown (SEVAR).\nThe study included 50 abdominal aortic aneurysm patients who were treated with PEVAR with a single Perclose ProGlide device and 96 patients treated with SEVAR. Technical success was defined as successful arterial closure of the common femoral artery without the need for adjunctive surgical or endovascular procedures. The rates of complications, including bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, pseudoaneurysm, paresthesia, and lymphocele, as well as the operating room time and hospital duration were compared between the PEVAR and SEVAR groups.\nTechnical success was obtained in all patients in the PEVAR group. One patient in the SEVAR group needed surgical repair due to access site bleeding. Complication rates were similar between the groups (4% in the PEVAR vs 8% in the SEVAR; P\u00a0= .495). The PEVAR group had significantly shorter operating room times (153\u00a0\u00b1 47\u00a0minutes vs 211\u00a0\u00b1 88\u00a0minutes, P\u00a0< .001) and hospital lengths of stay (6.7\u00a0\u00b1 6.8\u00a0days vs 9.3\u00a0\u00b1 4.5\u00a0days, P\u00a0< .001).\nCompared with SEVAR, PEVAR with a single ProGlide device is a safe procedure with a shorter operating room time and hospital stay, without increasing access site complications.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (ER) of axillosubclavian arterial injuries is a minimally invasive alternative to open repair (OR). The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of ER vs OR.\nA retrospective study was performed of patients who sustained axillosubclavian arterial injuries admitted to two high-volume academic trauma centers between 2003 and 2013. Patients undergoing ER and OR were matched according to 25 different demographic and clinical variables in a 1:3 ratio using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were complications and length of stay.\nAmong 153 patients (79.7% male; mean age, 32.7 \u00b1 15.9 years) who sustained axillosubclavian arterial injuries, 18 (11.8%) underwent ER and 135 (88.2%) had OR. Matched cases (ER, n = 18) and controls (OR, n = 54) had similar demographic and clinical data, such as age, gender, admission systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale score, body Abbreviated Injury Scale scores, Injury Severity Score, and transfusion requirements. Patients undergoing ER had significantly lower in-hospital mortality compared with patients undergoing OR (5.6% vs 27.8%; P = .040; odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-0.9). Similarly, patients undergoing ER had substantially lower rates of surgical site infections and a trend toward lower rates of sepsis. Outpatient follow-up was available in 88.2% (n = 15) of the patients at a median time of 8 months (1-30 months). Two ER patients required open reintervention for stent-related complications (one for a type Ia endoleak and another for stent thrombosis).\nIn our experience with axillosubclavian arterial injuries, ER was associated with improved mortality and lower complication rates. Patient follow-up demonstrates an acceptable reintervention rate after ER. Further multicenter prospective evaluation is warranted to determine long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Continuous suturing techniques have conventionally been used for the end-to-side anastomoses of radiocephalic fistulas (RCFs); however, primary patency rates are poor. Only 50% to 60% of RCFs ever achieve functional patency. We hypothesized that a hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique (as used in many microsurgical procedures) may improve outcomes in fistulas constructed from small vessels.\nA randomized controlled trial comparing hybrid interrupted-continuous (n = 42) with continuous (n = 36) suturing techniques for RCF was undertaken. Patients were excluded if vessels were <1.8 mm in diameter or if previous ipsilateral fistula had been attempted. A priori power calculation indicated that a sample size of 78 patients was required to detect an improvement in patency from 50% to 80% (\u03b1 = .05, \u03b2 = .8). The primary end point was primary patency at 6 weeks (assessed by a blinded observer for the presence of thrill and bruit). Secondary end points were immediate patency, functional patency (assessed clinically and by ultrasound) at 6 weeks, and presence of anastomotic stenosis.\nGroups were comparable for basic patient demographics, operating surgeon, and vessel diameter as measured on preoperative ultrasound (mean age, 58.9 \u00b1 13 years; 68% male). Primary patency at 6 weeks was higher in the hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique group (71% vs 47%; P = .01). Immediate patency was also higher in the hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique group (93% vs 67%; P < .001). There was no significant difference in functional patency at 6 weeks (52% vs 36%; P = .18). Three patients developed an anastomotic stenosis. All were in the hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique group. One patient from the interrupted suturing technique cohort required re-exploration for bleeding.\nA hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique yielded higher immediate and 6-week primary patency rates for RCF. The hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique may improve anastomotic compliance and reduce the narrowing and puckering that can occur on suture tightening in small-caliber vessels. Based on these findings, consideration should be given to performing hybrid interrupted-continuous anastomoses for RCFs.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to analyze the occurrence of postoperative urinary retention (POUR) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and determine whether there are any associated modifiable risk factors. CEA was chosen to minimize the confounding effects of known risk factors for POUR, including immobilization, regional and severe pain, and neuroaxial anesthesia.\nThis was a retrospective record review of 186 male patients undergoing CEA between 2007 and 2011. Demographic, comorbidities, and operative characteristics were compared. Continuous variables are reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and categoric variables as frequencies and proportions. Pearson \u03c7(2) or Mann-Whitney U tests compared categoric and continuous variables, respectively. Logistic regression was used to examine univariate and multivariate odds of POUR. Multivariate analysis controlled for known predictors of urinary retention. Association with other complications was examined with the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nPOUR occurred in 34 patients (18.3%). Median age and history of urinary tract infection (UTI) were significantly associated with POUR: median age was 73.0 years (IQR, 67-80 years) for those with POUR vs 69.5 years (IQR, 63-76 years) for those without (P = .047); 17.6% of patients with a history of UTI developed POUR vs 5.9% without (P = .023). These findings persisted on multivariate analysis controlling for known predictors of POUR (body mass index, history of diabetes, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prior prostate surgery): median age (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1-1.1) and history of UTI (odds ratio, 4.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-14.05; P = .022). The occurrence of POUR was significantly correlated with postoperative UTI: 18.8% with POUR vs 0.7% without (Pearson r = 0.369; P < .001).\nPOUR requiring bladder catheterization after CEA predisposes patients to postoperative UTI and is more common in older patients and those with a history of UTI. CEA patients lack inherent risk factors for POUR and would be a useful population for prospective studies involving POUR.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to improve outcomes for patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) are becoming more evident. The aging population, however, continues to make the decision to intervene often difficult, especially given that traditional risk models do not reflect issues of aging and frailty. This study aimed to integrate measures of function alongside comorbidity- and frailty-specific factors to determine outcome.\nPatients treated for a rAAA between January 2006 and April 2014 were assessed. Demographics, mortality, and requirement for care after discharge as well as a variety of measures of function (physical, social, and psychological) and comorbidity were recorded. The primary outcome was 1-year mortality. Outcome models were generated using multivariate logistic regression and were compared with models of vascular frailty and AAA-related outcome.\nOf 184 patients treated, 108 (59%) underwent an open surgical repair. The overall 30-day and 1-year mortality were 21.5% and 31.4%, respectively, with an overall median hospital length of stay of 13 days (interquartile range, 6-27 days). An optimal logistic regression model for 12-month mortality used Katz score, Charlson score, number of admission medicines, visual impairment, hearing impairment, hemoglobin level, and statin use as predictors, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84.\nThis novel rAAA model incorporating function and comorbidity offers good predictive power for mortality. It is quick to calculate and may ultimately become helpful for both counseling and selection of patients and comparative audit at a time when outcome in patients with rAAA increasingly comes under the spotlight.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (fEVAR) is being used increasingly in the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms; however, this procedure can be associated with visceral and renal complications. Because the causes of possible renal function (RF) impairment have not been fully examined yet, we conducted a study to investigate whether there are risk factors associate with renal ischemic lesions (RILs) and if they influence RF in patients treated for complex aortic aneurysm with fEVAR.\nWe evaluated the clinical, anatomic, and technical characteristics of consecutive patients treated with fEVAR from 2008 to 2014. RIL were identified by postoperative computed tomography angiography and the volume of renal parenchyma involved quantified. A decrease in RF (>30% glomerular filtration rate reduction) was evaluated at discharge, and at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups.\nAmong 53 patients, we analyzed 38 (72%) juxta/pararenal and 15 (28%) thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (33 [64%] with \u22653 fenestrations) and 102 renal arteries. Fifteen patients (30%) showed RIL, which was caused by accessory renal artery (ARA) coverage in 6 cases (38%), distal embolism in 6 (38%), renal artery thrombosis in 2 (18%), and iatrogenic embolization for intraoperative bleeding during fEVAR in 1 (6%). The volume of renal parenchyma involved was less than 25% in 10 (67%) and 25% to 50% in 5 (33%) cases. In no cases was more than 50% renal volume affected. On multivariate analysis, RIL predictors were the presence of ARA (odds ratio [OR], 8.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-54.89; P = .03) and extensive thrombosis of the pararenal aorta (OR, 39.93; 95% CI, 3.36-474.23; P = .003). At discharge, chronic renal failure (CRF; OR, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.27-18.09; P = .01), diabetes (OR, 8.44; 95% CI, 1.33-53.51; P = .01), and extensive thrombosis of the pararenal aorta (OR, 5.50; 95% CI, 1.32-29.92; P = .01) were significantly associated with worsening RF. RIL, independent from volume, did not influence the postoperative RF. At 6 months and 1-year, preoperative CRF and perioperative declines in RF were identified as the only risk factors for worsening RF.\nRIL is a common fEVAR complication and is primarily owing to ARA coverage and aortic thrombus embolization. However, RIL does not influence RF, which is predicted by preoperative CRF, diabetes, and extensive aortic thrombus.",

We present our experience with RUDI for the treatment of ISS and pathologic HF.\nWe retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent RUDI for ISS from April, 2010 to March, 2014.

Indications for surgery were pathologic HF in 13 and ISS in 19. Ten percent had previous banding for ISS or HF. Sixty-nine percent of patients had a history of diabetes. Fifty-two percent had a history of atherosclerotic disease. Mean time to intervention from creation was 40 months (range, 6-88 months). Accesses included 1 upper arm graft and 27 brachial artery-based fistulas. Outflow included 25 cephalic veins and 3 basilic veins. Distalization targets were 19 radial arteries and 10 ulnar arteries. Mean flow reduction was 1191 mL/min. Primary assisted patency at 1 year was 74%. Secondary patency at 1 year was 87%. A single access was ligated for continued heart failure after RUDI.

Participating in the United States Food and Drug Administration's new Innovation Pathway, this first-in-human, early feasibility study evaluates early clinical experience of the Valiant Mona LSA Stent Graft System in patients with DTAs where the proximal landing zone necessitates LSA coverage.\nThis premarket, nonrandomized, single-arm prospective study recruited nine patients (age 72.9 \u00b1 7.6 years). Primary end points were aneurysm-related mortality, stroke, paraplegia, left arm/hand ischemia, and treatment success. Neurologic events were assessed by imaging and by independent neurologists. Inclusion criteria required patients with a DTA or penetrating aortic ulcer to have a distance of \u226510 mm between the left common carotid artery and the LSA. Mean aneurysm diameter was 53.7 \u00b1 10.0 mm. The indication for repair was for saccular DTA in five patients or fusiform DTA in four. Seven patients were at American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification III/IV.\nAll nine patients received one main stent graft (diameter 28 to 42 mm) and one branch stent graft (diameter 10 to 14 mm). To extend device coverage distally, a commercial Valiant Captivia device was implanted in seven patients. No uncorrected endoleaks were observed at the end of the implant procedure. Four endoleaks developed before discharge in four of eight evaluable patients. Two were identified as type II and two were of undetermined type. No endoleak resulted in a secondary intervention. Technical success, defined by the clinical investigational plan, was achieved in all nine patients intraoperatively, and treatment success was achieved in all eight evaluable patients at 1 month. There were no major, disabling strokes. Four minor nondisabling strokes were reported in three patients \u226430 days (days 1, 1, 5, and 24). To date, there have been no reports of death, left arm ischemia, paraplegia, rupture, conversion to open surgery, or secondary endovascular procedure. No patients required surgical LSA revascularization.\nThe Valiant Mona LSA system demonstrates technical and treatment success, relative safety, and early durability in its initial use in DTA patients. Midterm results are expected as patients are monitored at regular intervals to 5 years.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the Misago stent (Terumo Corp, Tokyo, Japan) in occlusive and stenotic superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease.\nThe safety and efficacy of the Misago SFA stent were evaluated prospectively in this initial collaboration trial between Japan and the United States. Because this trial enrolled patients mainly from Japan and the United States and because there is a question as to whether a race difference exists in SFA stent performance, the race difference on outcome was also analyzed. In addition, results were compared with a prior SFA stent trial.\nThe Misago stent was implanted in 261 subjects with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) type A and type B SFA lesions (201 subjects in the United States, 50 in Japan, 9 in Taiwan, 1 in South Korea). The mean age of the patients was 69.3 \u00b1 10.0 years, and the mean lesion length was 83.8 \u00b1 41.3 mm. The overall 12-month primary patency rate and clinically driven target lesion revascularization were 82.9% and 13.0%, respectively. Regional differences within the Occlusive/Stenotic Peripheral Artery Revascularization Study (OSPREY) and outcomes between U.S. and Asian patients were similar, including primary patency (82.9% vs 83.0%; P = .889), clinically driven target lesion revascularization (13.4% vs 11.7%; P = .829), stent fracture rate (1.3% vs 0.0%; P = 1.000), and stent thrombosis rate (0.5% vs 0.0%; P = 1.000).\nOSPREY 12-month data showed satisfactory outcome of the Misago stent for the treatment of TASC type A and type B SFA lesions and appears to be comparable to recent stent trials. In addition, the lack of difference in outcome among races supports the value of international trials.",

    "abstract": "Over several decades, there has been an increase in the number of elderly patients requiring hemodialysis. These older patients typically have an increased incidence of comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. We undertook a systematic review of the current literature to assess outcomes of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) formation in the elderly and to compare the results of radiocephalic AVFs vs brachiocephalic AVFs in older patients.\nA literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. All retrieved articles published before December 31, 2014 (and in English) primarily describing the creation of hemodialysis vascular access for elderly patients were considered for inclusion. We report pooled AVF patency rates and a comparison of radiocephalic vs brachiocephalic AVF patency rates using odds ratios (ORs).\nOf 199 relevant articles reviewed, 15 were deemed eligible for the review. The pooled 12-month primary and secondary AVF patency rates were 53.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.3-59.9) and 71.6% (95% CI, 59.2-82.7), respectively. Comparison of radiocephalic vs brachiocephalic AVF patency rates demonstrated that radiocephalic AVFs have inferior primary (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93; P = .01) and secondary (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00; P = .05) patency rates.\nThis meta-analysis confirms that adequate 12-month primary and secondary AVF patency rates can be achieved in elderly patients. Brachiocephalic AVFs have both superior primary and secondary patency rates at 12 months compared with radiocephalic AVFs. These important data can inform clinicians' and patients' decision-making about suitability of attempting AVF formation in older persons.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of penetrating ulcers of the iliac arteries (PUIA) has not been previously described. The potential for degeneration into pseudoanerysm and rupture are feared complications. It is hypothesized that PUIA, similar to their thoracic aortic counterparts, signal impending vascular catastrophe.\nA search of computed tomography (CT) angiography reports for the words, \"penetrating ulcer\" was performed. Patients with PUIA who underwent CT imaging from October 2010 to August 2011 were identified. Their clinical course was followed through December 2014. If patients with PUIA had additional vascular pathology that necessitated intervention, it was performed. A prospective and retrospective review of the imaging was performed when possible. Associated iliac diameter and ulcer dimensions were measured for patients with repeat imaging (n = 22). Demographic characteristics were compared for patients who were identified as having penetrating ulcers of the abdominal aorta. Mann-Whitney U, Fisher exact, and Pearson correlation coefficient tests were performed for statistical analysis.\nThe calculated incidence of PUIA for patients who underwent CT imaging was 0.3%. The age at the time of diagnosis was 70.7 \u00b1 10.0 years and the cohort included 28 male patients (82.3%). Median clinical and imaging follow-up was 42.0 (range, 1-82) months and 40.5 (range, 1-77) months. Most patients had a history of hypertension (82.4%), hyperlipidemia (76.5%), and tobacco use (70.6%). Twenty-one patients (61.8%) had concomitant aneurysms not necessarily associated with the PUIA. Although no PUIA rupture occurred, the population was sick because seven patients (20.6%) were deceased at the study end. Only one individual presented with symptoms that could possibly be attributed to their PUIA. Repeat imaging was performed for 22 patients (64.7%). The calculated median iliac artery diameter growth rate through the PUIA was 0.1 (range, 0-4.1) mm/y.\nPUIA are generally slow-growing and are found incidentally. Most patients with PUIA were in their eighth decade with a history of hypertension and tobacco use. Patients with PUIA frequently have concurrent aortic aneurysm disease that requires intervention. The mortality for this population was high, but was not caused by rupture of a PUIA. Diameter changes noted in the PUIA during follow-up did not suggest ulcer treatment would improve survival.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity bypass grafts that develop stenoses are commonly treated with either open surgical or endovascular revision. Vein graft stenoses with unfavorable lesions (multiple lesions, lesions >2 cm in length, lesions in grafts <3 months old, lesions in grafts <3 mm in diameter) fare worse than those with favorable lesions when treated with endovascular therapy. However, it is not known if unfavorable lesions fare better with surgical revision than with endovascular treatment or than favorable lesions treated with surgery.\nWe performed a retrospective review of 175 vein graft revisions performed at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Characteristics of lesions treated with surgical and endovascular revision were identified. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify predictors of revision failure (restenosis >75%, revision, or amputation).\nNinety-one failing vein grafts (52%) were treated with surgical revision and 84 with endovascular treatment (48%), with a median follow-up of 30 months. Favorable lesions fared better than unfavorable lesions after endovascular treatment, with 12-month freedom from failure of 59% vs 34% (P < .01), but not after surgical revision (66% vs 62%; P = .90). Unfavorable lesions had better freedom from failure after surgery than endovascular treatment (62% vs 34%; P < .01), and results in favorable lesions were similar (66% vs 59%; P = .57).\nFor the treatment of failing vein grafts, endovascular therapy appears adequate for favorable lesions and surgical revision is more durable for unfavorable lesions.",

    "abstract": "Infrapopliteal bypass is an established and effective method for limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia. Secondary interventions maybe required to maintain graft patency. The aim of this study was to look at the frequency and outcomes of such interventions.\nConsecutive patients undergoing bypasses onto the infrapopliteal vessels for critical limb ischemia (Rutherford 4-6) at a single institution were analyzed between 2009 and 2013. The primary end points were graft patency, amputation-free survival (AFS), and freedom from reintervention at 12 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nA total of 114 infrapopliteal bypasses were performed in 102 patients. Distal anastomosis was on to the anterior tibial (n = 31), posterior tibial (n = 27), peroneal (n = 24), tibioperoneal trunk (n = 23), or dorsalis pedis artery (n = 9). Primary patency, assisted primary patency, and secondary patency was 57%, 76%, and 82%, respectively, at 12 months and 44%, 70%, and 80%, respectively, at 36 months. AFS was 80% at 12 months and 65% at 36 months. Endovascular salvage interventions were performed on 58 grafts (51%) including angioplasty of inflow/proximal anastomosis (33%), outflow/distal anastomosis (46%), and graft stenosis (20%), with a further 12 grafts (11%) undergoing thrombolysis for occlusion. Surgical salvage interventions included jump grafts (n = 7), revision of anastomotic stenosis (n = 3), and thrombectomy (n = 2). AFS was similar in salvaged threatened and acutely occluded grafts compared with nonthreatened grafts (P = .064) and better in grafts requiring reintervention later (>6 months from bypass) compared with those requiring early reintervention (<6 months; P = .047).\nSecondary interventions in threatened distal bypass grafts are successful at maintaining graft patency and AFS when compared with nonthreatened grafts, and are associated with a low morbidity rate.",

    "abstract": "The Nellix EndoVascular Aneurysm Sealing system (Endologix, Inc, Irvine, Calif) is a novel approach to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) endovascular repair whereby biocompatible polymer is employed to exclude and to seal the AAA sac. We report 30-day results of the U.S. pivotal trial.\nConsecutive, eligible, consenting patients were enrolled at 29 sites in the United States and Europe. Inclusion criteria required an asymptomatic infrarenal AAA, with aortic neck length \u226510 mm and angle to the sac \u226460 degrees, aortic neck diameter of 18 to 32 mm, aneurysm blood lumen diameter \u22646 cm, common iliac artery lumen diameter of 9 to 35 mm, access artery diameter \u22656 mm, and serum creatinine level \u22642 mg/dL. Follow-up at 30 days included clinical assessment and computed tomography angiography evaluation of endoleaks and device integrity as assessed by a core laboratory. The primary safety end point is the incidence of independently adjudicated 30-day major adverse events (MAEs), with success defined as superiority with reference to the Society for Vascular Surgery open repair control group (56%).\nBetween January and November 2014, 150 trial patients having a mean AAA diameter of 5.8 cm were enrolled and treated with the Nellix system with 100% procedural success. One early death (0.7%) occurred secondary to multisystem organ failure. All 149 surviving patients completed 30-day follow-up. There were no aneurysm ruptures, conversions, limb thromboses, stent fractures, or stent kinking. Five early MAEs occurred in four patients (2.7%) and included one death, bowel ischemia (1), renal failure (2), and respiratory failure (1). One (0.7%) secondary intervention to treat inadvertent coverage of a renal artery was performed. The core laboratory identified nine (6%) endoleaks (one type I, eight type II) on 30-day computed tomography angiography. Freedom from MAE was 97.3% (95% confidence interval, 93.3%-99.0%).\nIn selected patients, perioperative outcomes with the Nellix system for endovascular aneurysm sealing are encouraging, with very low 30-day morbidity and mortality and high procedural success. The primary safety end point has been achieved. Longer term follow-up is in progress.",

    "abstract": "After its introduction in six pilot centers in 2009, the National Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme (NAAASP) is now established across the United Kingdom, demonstrating significant benefit in terms of fewer emergency surgeries and reduced 30-day surgical mortality. However, according to publication of data on annual screened abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) detection, a lower incidence than predicted in the original screening trials has been found. In this audit we assessed features and risk factors of men found to have a positive scan result in the southwest London AAA screening program, to determine screening yield for subgroups of populations and assess the case for a more targeted screening program.\nData from the NAAASP screening database for England were extracted for all men who attended screening from the April 1, 2009 through October 16, 2013 in the southwest London area. Primary outcomes were aneurysm prevalence, risk factors, and incidence within subgroups. Results were reviewed against nationally reported data and London census data.\nOf 24,891 men who were screened in the southwest London program during this period, 292 AAAs were identified (1.18%). Patients were asked to categorize their ethnic background according to classifications provided by the office of national statistics. Those at highest risk of AAA were white-British (1.35%), followed by black and black British (0.65%), and Asian/Asian British (0.23%). Number needed to screen to identify one AAA was calculated as 78, 154, and 431, respectively. The relative proportions of patients screened were similar to that described in the most recent United Kingdom census, except for white-British patients, indicating a shortfall in acceptance of screening invitations in this group. There were no AAA identified in Chinese men. A positive smoking history was found in 90%, a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension in 50%, hypercholesterolemia in 34%, and ischemic heart disease in 21%.\nWithin southwest London, AAA was most strongly associated with being white-British, a previous or current smoker, and known hypertension. Targeted education in patient groups with identified risk factors for AAA should be considered to improve screening yield without excluding any subgroup from the screening program. This could draw on resources released by unused scans because of lower than predicted prevalence. AAA diagnosis should be seen as an opportunity to address the increased all-cause mortality associated with aortic aneurysmal disease.",

Before the surgery, 17 patients (77%) and 67 patients (64%) were ambulatory in the very elderly and control groups, respectively. At follow-up at 29 \u00b1 22 months, the rates of primary (P = .33) and secondary patency (P = .14), limb salvage (P = .50), survival (P = .26), amputation-free survival (P = .42), major adverse limb event and also perioperative death (P = .11), and major adverse cardiovascular events (P = .36) did not significantly differ between the groups. In multivariate analysis, a history of coronary artery disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-5.9; P = .005), preoperative nonambulatory status (HR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.1-8.1; P < .0001), and serum albumin levels <3 g/dL (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.4; P = .01) were significantly related to poor amputation-free survival. Thirteen patients (59%) remained ambulatory at the latest follow-up. In 91 patients (110 limbs) with tissue loss, the Society for Vascular Surgery lower extremity threatened limb classification system: risk stratification based on Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection classification stages 3 and 4 negatively affected complete wound healing, according to multivariate analysis (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20-0.61; P = .0005).\nA very elderly age should not preclude a patient from undergoing distal bypass surgery. A history of coronary artery disease, a nonambulatory status, and hypoalbuminemia, along with the Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection classification for patients with tissue loss, should be carefully considered to obtain the most benefit from distal bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Aortobifemoral graft (ABFG) infections presenting with apparent single-limb involvement can be managed with unilateral graft limb excision or complete graft removal. This study aimed to identify outcomes of unilateral graft limb excision for infected ABFGs and factors predictive of subsequent contralateral or main body graft limb infection.\nA retrospective review of patients treated with unilateral graft limb excision for infection of an isolated limb of an ABFG from 2001 to July 2014 was performed. Endovascular and aortic tube graft infections were excluded. Outcomes were freedom from contralateral graft limb excision, overall survival, and factors predicting subsequent contralateral limb or main body infection.\nFifteen patients underwent unilateral graft limb excision and revascularization for treatment of an infected ABFG isolated to one graft limb. Indications for the original ABFG were aortoiliac occlusive disease in 11 patients and aortoiliac aneurysm in 4 patients. All patients presented with clinical evidence consistent with unilateral graft limb infection and clinical findings confirmed radiographically. Unilateral graft explantation was performed for isolated infrainguinal graft limb infection with no retroperitoneal infection on exploration or if patients were too ill to tolerate total graft explantation despite infection in the retroperitoneum. Seven patients, all of whom underwent initial operation for aortoiliac occlusive disease, developed contralateral limb infection at a median follow-up of 23.2 months after unilateral excision. The remaining eight patients remained free of contralateral graft limb infection at median follow-up of 38.8 months. Patient demographics were similar between the two groups. Factors predictive of contralateral graft limb infection included an ABFG placed for aortoiliac occlusive disease (P = .03) and culture evidence of infection above the inguinal ligament (P = .07; positive predictive value of 71%). Median duration of targeted antibiotic therapy was 42 days, and neither duration of antibiotics nor cultured microorganism predicted recurrent graft infection. Overall mortality was 40% and was similar between patients who developed contralateral or main body graft infection and those who did not. There was no limb loss, and overall median follow-up was 44.7 months.\nIsolated unilateral infection of an ABFG limb can be managed with single graft limb excision, provided the infection is isolated to the infrainguinal graft segment. Factors predicting subsequent contralateral or main body graft infection include ABFGs originally placed for aortoiliac occlusive disease and culture-positive graft infection above the inguinal ligament.",

    "abstract": "Wound severity is assessed mainly by the Rutherford classification for critical limb ischemia (CLI) with tissue loss. The Rutherford classification is based on the extent of tissue loss; however, its classification criteria are ambiguous and do not include information regarding wound depth. We investigated the effects of wound depth on clinical outcomes in CLI with tissue loss after endovascular treatment (EVT).\nBetween April 2007 and August 2013, we enrolled 210 consecutive patients (247 limbs) who received EVT for CLI with tissue loss. In the limbs examined, 271 individual wounds existed. We evaluated wound depth using the University of Texas grade (grade 1: superficial wound not involving the tendon, capsule, or bone, n = 97; grade 2: wound penetrating the tendon or capsule, n = 124; and grade 3: wound penetrating the bone or joint, n = 50). We also investigated the wound healing rate at 12 months and limb salvage and major amputation-free survival rates 3 years after EVT.\nThe wound healing rates at 12 months in Texas 1, 2, and 3 were 88%, 48%, and 24%, respectively (log-rank P < .001). The limb salvage and major amputation-free survival rates at 3 years were lower in deep wounds than in shallow wounds (limb salvage rates: 98%, 82%, and 67%, respectively; P < .001; major amputation-free survival rates: 78%, 52%, and 42%, respectively; P < .001). In only minor tissue loss, the wound healing rates at 12 months and the limb salvage and major amputation-free survival rates at 3 years were stratified according to wound depth (wound healing rates: 92% in Texas 1 and 51% in Texas 2 or 3; P < .001; limb salvage rates: 99% in Texas 1 and 86% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .001; major amputation-free survival rates: 79% in Texas 1 and 57% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .001). In only major tissue loss, deep wounds also caused poor outcomes compared with shallow wounds (wound healing rates: 70% in Texas 1 and 36% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .019; limb salvage rates: 94% in Texas 1 and 73% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .050; major amputation-free survival rates: 75% in Texas 1 and 45% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .039).\nWound depth is an important indicator of wound status and affects the clinical outcomes of CLI with tissue loss.",

For each study, data regarding SRC prevalence in both the AAA and control groups were used to generate unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals.

    "abstract": "The use of femoral-popliteal vein as a conduit to treat infected aortoiliac pathologies has been described extensively and is referred to as the neoaortoiliac system procedure. We examined our center's outcomes after using deep vein as a conduit for the salvage of failed aortofemoral prosthetic bypasses in patients without infection.\nProcedures using femoral vein as conduit at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences between January 2005 and July 2013 were retrospectively reviewed (n = 110). Patients were excluded if the reconstruction was for infectious etiologies (n = 71) or for nonaortofemoral reconstructions (n = 31). Operative variables, complications, and patency rates were collected.\nFemoral vein was used to revascularize failed aortobifemoral bypasses in eight patients. Indications included rest pain (n = 7) and short-distance claudication (n = 1). Reconstructions identified two patients each with aortobifemoral bypass or aortofemoral bypass, and one patient each with aortofemoral bypass with femorofemoral bypass, aorotoiliac bypass, iliofemoral bypass with femorofemoral bypass, or ilioprofunda bypass. Mean follow up was 27.5 months. There were no major postoperative complications. Symptoms secondary to deep vein harvest (swelling/dermatitis) developed in three of eight patients. The average ankle-brachial index improved from 0.33 to 0.73 (P = .003), with a limb salvage rate of 100%. Kaplan-Meier analysis found primary patency was 70% at 1 year and 53% at 5 years, which improved to 100% and 75%, respectively, with secondary measures.\nDespite a need for secondary interventions and venous hypertension syndromes, deep vein offers good patency and excellent limb salvage after failed prosthetic aortoiliac bypasses.",

Reconstructions identified two patients each with aortobifemoral bypass or aortofemoral bypass, and one patient each with aortofemoral bypass with femorofemoral bypass, aorotoiliac bypass, iliofemoral bypass with femorofemoral bypass, or ilioprofunda bypass. Mean follow up was 27.5 months. There were no major postoperative complications. Symptoms secondary to deep vein harvest (swelling/dermatitis) developed in three of eight patients. The average ankle-brachial index improved from 0.33 to 0.73 (P = .003), with a limb salvage rate of 100%. Kaplan-Meier analysis found primary patency was 70% at 1 year and 53% at 5 years, which improved to 100% and 75%, respectively, with secondary measures.",

    "abstract": "The chimney/snorkel endovascular aortic repair (ch-EVAR) is gaining ever-greater acceptance in the treatment of pararenal pathologic processes. However, the published experience includes mainly short-term clinical results with combinations of several abdominal devices and types of chimney grafts. The aim of this study was the midterm evaluation of the Endurant stent graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) as a standard abdominal device for ch-EVAR.\nBetween January 2009 and January 2013, prospectively collected data of high-risk patients with pararenal pathologic processes who underwent ch-EVAR with placement of the Endurant abdominal device were analyzed. The chimney graft intended for use was a balloon-expandable covered stent. Main outcome measures were aneurysm sac regression and chimney graft patency.\nA total of 187 snorkel/chimney grafts were successfully placed in 128 patients (mean age, 76.6 years). The technical success was 100%. The mean preoperative proximal neck length and aneurysm size were 4.7 mm and 64.8 mm (range, 48-135 mm), respectively. The postoperative new neck length after use of chimney grafts was 18.7 \u00b1 6.3 mm. The mean aneurysm sac decreased significantly (60.8 mm; 95% confidence interval, 2.036-7.084; P = .001) after a mean radiologic follow up of 24.6 \u00b1 17.4 months. Thirty-day mortality and midterm mortality were 0.8% and 17.2%, respectively. Two patients (1.6%) with single chimneys presented with late new onset of type Ia endoleak and underwent additional tube and multiple chimney placement. Primary chimney graft patency was 95.7%. Freedom from chimney graft-related reinterventions was 93.1%.\nStandard use of the Endurant abdominal device for ch-EVAR in >120 patients is associated with high technical success, significant aneurysm sac regression, and low incidence of secondary procedures after 2-year radiologic follow-up. These results will give significant impetus to device selection, facilitating the standardization of technique.",

    "abstract": "We determined whether scores on a cognitive screening measure were associated with the primary outcome measure of peak walking time (PWT) and with secondary outcome measures related to mobility, community-based ambulation, health-related quality of life (QoL), and vascular function in patients with claudication and peripheral artery disease (PAD).\nGross cognitive status of 246 PAD patients was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire. Patients were grouped according to whether they had a perfect MMSE score of 30 points (n = 123) or whether they missed one or more points (n = 123). Patients were characterized on numerous outcomes, including PWT during a treadmill test and QoL.\nCompared with the group with the higher MMSE scores, there was a trend for lower PWT in the group with the lower MMSE scores (P = .06) after adjusting for age, sex, race, and education level (model 1), which became significant (380 \u00b1 250 seconds vs 460 \u00b1 270 seconds; P < .05) after adjusting for model 1 plus coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and arthritis (model 2). Multiple domains of QoL were lower (P < .05) in the group with the lower MMSE scores after adjusting for model 1, but only mental health remained lower (75 \u00b1 20% vs 80 \u00b1 5%; P = .02) after further adjustment with model 2.\nIn symptomatic patients with PAD, lower cognitive screening scores were associated with greater ambulatory impairment than in patients with higher MMSE scores. Furthermore, worse cognitive status was associated with lower scores in multiple dimensions of health-related QoL, all of which except mental health were explained by the comorbid conditions of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and arthritis. The clinical significance is that there is a need for enhanced cognitive and mental health screening as potential indicators of poor outcome among symptomatic patients with PAD. Furthermore, patients identified as having worse cognitive status might be in greatest need of intervention to improve ambulation and QoL related to mental health.",

    "abstract": "Major lower extremity (MLE) amputation is a common procedure that results in a profound change in a patient's life. We sought to determine the association between social support and outcomes after amputation. We hypothesized that patients with greater social support will have better post amputation outcomes.\nFrom November 2011 to May 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study. Social integration was measured by the social integration subset of the Short Form Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique. Systemic social support was assessed by comparing a United States and Tanzanian population. Walking function was measured using the 6-minute walk test and quality of life (QoL) was measured using the EuroQol-5D.\nWe recruited 102 MLE amputees. Sixty-three patients were enrolled in the United States with a mean age of 58.0. Forty-two (67%) were male. Patients with low social integration were more likely to be unable to ambulate (no walk 39% vs slow walk 23% vs fast walk 10%; P = .01) and those with high social integration were more likely to be fast walkers (no walk 10% vs slow walk 59% vs fast walk 74%; P = .01). This relationship persisted in a multivariable analysis. Increasing social integration scores were also positively associated with increasing QoL scores in a multivariable analysis (\u03b2, .002; standard error, 0.0008; P = .02). In comparing the United States population with the Tanzanian cohort (39 subjects), there were no differences between functional or QoL outcomes in the systemic social support analysis.\nIn the United States population, increased social integration is associated with both improved function and QoL outcomes among MLE amputees. Systemic social support, as measured by comparing the United States population with a Tanzanian population, was not associated with improved function or QoL outcomes. In the United States, steps should be taken to identify and aid amputees with poor social integration.",

    "abstract": "Surveillance of patients identified with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from an AAA screening program poses a challenge for health systems because of numerous patient follow-ups. This study evaluates the surveillance outcomes of patients identified with small AAA from a large screening program.\nA retrospective chart review of all patients screened for small AAA (3.0-5.4 cm) from 2007 to 2011 was conducted. Patients with small AAA and no previous history of repair were tracked for follow-up using the 2013 RESCAN follow-up guidelines according to aortic diameter (3.0-3.9 cm, 3 years; 4.0-4.4 cm, 2 years; 4.5-5.4 cm, 1 year). Socioeconomic factors that may influence the follow-up rate and all-cause mortality after screening, including marital status, distance to hospital from residence, estimated household income, and employment disability status, were also evaluated.\nA total of 568 patients (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 73.4 \u00b1 7.2 years old) with small AAA (3.6 \u00b1 0.6 cm) were analyzed. Patient follow-up rate was 65.1% (n = 370 of 568). Reasons for follow-up failure were lack of the physician's ordering a scan (n = 139; 70.2%), delayed ordering of scans (n = 36; 18.2%), patient no-show (n = 18; 9.1%), or patient death before follow-up (n = 5; 2.5%). Of all patient-specific factors, patients with smaller diameters were unlikely to achieve follow-up scans (P < .001). A significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality was found for patients with no ultrasound follow-up scan (hazard ratio [HR], 0.369; P < .001), assisted living (HR, 0.381; P < .001), older age (HR, 1.04; P = .001), and lower household incomes (HR, 0.989; P = .01).\nThe follow-up rate of patients with small AAA was poor at 65.1%. The data indicate that socioeconomic factors do not significantly affect follow-up success. Therefore, physician ordering of scans may exert the greatest influence on follow-up rates in patients with small AAA. Automatic ordering of follow-up scans for patients with small AAAs is proposed to improve follow-up rates.",

Of all patient-specific factors, patients with smaller diameters were unlikely to achieve follow-up scans (P < .001). A significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality was found for patients with no ultrasound follow-up scan (hazard ratio [HR], 0.369; P < .001), assisted living (HR, 0.381; P < .001), older age (HR, 1.04; P = .001), and lower household incomes (HR, 0.989; P = .01).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiation exposure of vascular surgeons' eye lens and fingers during complex endovascular procedures in modern hybrid operating rooms.\nProspective, nonrandomized multicenter study design. One hundred seventy-one consecutive patients (138 male; median age, 72.5 years [interquartile range, 65-77 years]) underwent an endovascular procedure in a hybrid operating room between March 2012 and July 2013 in two vascular centers. The dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time, operating time, and amount of contrast dye were registered prospectively. For radiation dose recordings, single-use dosimeters were attached at eye level and to the ring finger of the hand next to the radiation field of the operator for each endovascular procedure. Dose recordings were evaluated by an independent institution. Before the study, precursory investigations were obtained to simulate the radiation dose to eye lens and fingers with an Alderson phantome (RSD, Long Beach, Calif).\nInterventions were classified into six treatment categories: endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aneurysm (n = 65), thoracic endovascular aortic repair (n = 32), branched endovascular aortic repair for thoracoabdominal aneurysms (n = 17), fenestrated endovascular aortic repair for complex abdominal aortic aneurysm, (n = 25), iliac branched device (n = 8), and peripheral interventions (n = 24). There was a significant correlation in DAP between both lens (P < .01; r = 0.55) and finger (P < .01; r = 0.56) doses. The estimated fluoroscopy time to reach a radiation threshold of 20 mSv/y was 1404.10 minutes (90% confidence limit, 1160, 1650 minutes). According to correlation of the lens dose with the DAP an estimated cumulative DAP of 932,000 mGy/m(2) (90% confidence limit, 822,000, 1,039,000) would be critical for a threshold of 20 mSv/y for the eyes.\nRadiation protection is a serious issue for vascular surgeons because most complex endovascular procedures are delivering measurable radiation to the eyes. With the correlation of the DAP obtained in standard endovascular procedures a critical threshold of 20 mSv/y to the eyes can be predicted and thus an estimate of a potential harmful exposure to the eyes can be obtained.",

Demographics, indications, anatomic characteristics, and outcomes were collected. Standard statistical methods were used.\nA total of 186 PAAs were repaired in 156 patients (110 ORs, 76 ERs) with a mean age of 71 \u00b1 11 years, and most were male (96%). Mean follow-up was 34.9 \u00b1 28.6 months for OR and 28.3 \u00b1 25.8 months for ER (P = .12). Comorbidities were similar between groups. OR was used in more patients with PAA thrombosis (41.8% vs 5.3%; P < .001), acute ischemia (24.5% vs 9.2%; P = .010), and ischemic rest pain (34.5% vs 6.6%; P < .001). Mean tibial (Society for Vascular Surgery) runoff score was 5.0 for OR vs 3.3 for ER (P = .006). OR was associated with increased 30-day complications (22% vs 2.6%; P < .001) and mean postoperative stay (5.8 vs 1.6 days; P < .001). There was no difference in 30-day mortality (OR, 1.8%; ER, 0%; P = .56) or major amputation rate (OR, 3.7%; ER, 1.3%; P = .65). Primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were similar at 3 years (OR, 79.5%, 83.7%, and 85%; ER, 73.2%, 76.3%, and 83%; P = NS). Among 130 patients presenting electively without acute ischemia or thrombosed PAA (63 ORs and 67 ERs), OR had better 3-year primary patency (88.3% vs 69.8%; P = .030) and primary assisted patency (90.2% vs 73.5%; P = .051) but similar secondary patency (90.2% vs 82%; P = .260).

The purpose of this study was to determine differences in occupational exposure between procedures performed with fixed imaging (FI) in an endovascular suite compared with conventional mobile imaging (MI) in a standard operating room.\nA series of 116 endovascular cases were performed over a 4-month interval in a dedicated endovascular suite with FI and conventional operating room with MI. All cases were performed at a single institution and radiation dose was recorded using real-time dosimetry badges from Unfors RaySafe (Hopkinton, Mass). A dosimeter was mounted in each room to establish a radiation baseline. Staff dose was recorded using individual badges worn on the torso lead. Total mean air kerma (Kar; mGy, patient dose) and mean case dose (mSv, scattered radiation) were compared between rooms and across all staff positions for cases of varying complexity. Statistical analyses for all continuous variables were performed using t test and analysis of variance where appropriate.\nA total of 43 cases with MI and 73 cases with FI were performed by four vascular surgeons. Total mean Kar, and case dose were significantly higher with FI compared with MI.

Exposure for the primary surgeon and assistant was significantly higher with FI compared with MI. Mean exposure for all cases using either imaging modality, was significantly higher for the primary surgeon and assistant than for support staff (ie, nurse, radiology technologist) beyond 6 feet from the X-ray source, indicated according to one-way analysis of variance (MI: P < .00001; FI: P < .00001). Support staff exposure was negligible and did not differ between FI and MI. Room dose stratified according to case complexity (Kar) showed statistically significantly higher scattered radiation in FI vs MI across all quartiles.\nThe scattered radiation is several-fold higher with FI than MI across all levels of case complexity. Radiation exposure decreases with distance from the radiation source, and is negligible outside of a 6-foot radius. Modern endovascular suites allow high-fidelity imaging, yet additional strategies to minimize exposure and occupational risk are needed.",

Restenosis of the SFA after endovascular intervention is a common problem leading to 1-year primary patency as low as 40%. These failures are primarily due to the development of neointimal hyperplasia, resulting from arterial wall inflammation.\nThis was a randomized, phase II trial examining SFA restenosis in patients after percutaneous revascularization. Randomization occurred after successful revascularization, and patients were assigned to either the standard of care arm or the Xilonix (XBiotech USA, Inc, Austin, Tex) plus standard of care arm (N = 43). Xilonix was administered immediately after revascularization, every 2 weeks intravenously for four doses, and monthly subcutaneously until month 12. The major efficacy end points were target vessel event-free survival and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs).\nAt 12 months of follow-up, MACE (43% vs 36%; P = .76) and target vessel restenosis (24% vs 27%; log-rank, P = .79) rates were not significantly different between the groups. At 3-month follow-up, which covers the intravenous dosing period, a trend toward lower incidence of restenosis (0 of 22 [0%] vs 2 of 21 [10%]; P = .14) and MACE (2 of 22 [9%] vs 5 of 21 [24%]; P = .22) was observed in the Xilonix cohort. Adverse events were equally distributed in both arms.\nXilonix was well tolerated. Observed tendency to improved vessel patency with intravenous dosing suggests Xilonix could potentially represent a safe and effective therapeutic approach to preserving vessel patency.",

Based on preoperative computed tomography evaluation of anatomic criteria, 107 patients (85%) were defined as at risk for EII and assigned to randomization for standard EVAR (group A; n = 55, 44%) or EVAR with intraoperative sac embolization (group B; n = 52, 42%); the remaining 19 patients (15%) were defined as at low risk for EII and excluded from the randomization (group C). Computed tomography scans were evaluated with OsiriX Pro 4.0 software to obtain aneurysm sac volume. Freedom from EII, freedom from EII-related reintervention, and aneurysm sac volume shrinkage at 6, 12, and 24 months were compared by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Patients in group C underwent the same follow-up protocol as groups A and B.\nPatient characteristics, Society for Vascular Surgery comorbidity scores (0.99 \u00b1 0.50 vs 0.95 \u00b1 0.55; P = .70), and operative time (149 \u00b1 50 minutes vs 157 \u00b1 39 minutes; P = .63) were similar for groups A and B. Freedom from EII was significantly lower for group A compared with group B at 3 months (58% vs 80%; P = .002), 6 months (68% vs 85%; P = .04), and 12 months (70% vs 87%; P = .04) but not statistically significant at 24 months (85% vs 87%; P = .57). Freedom from EII-related reintervention at 24 months was significantly lower for group A compared with group B (82% vs 96%; P = .04). Patients in group B showed a significantly overall mean difference in aneurysm sac volume shrinkage compared with group A at 6 months (-11 \u00b1 17 cm(3) vs -2 \u00b1 14 cm(3); P < .01), 12 months (-18 \u00b1 26 cm(3) vs -3 \u00b1 32 cm(3); P = .02), and 24 months (-27 \u00b1 25 cm(3) vs -5 \u00b1 26 cm(3); P < .01). Patients in group C had the lowest EII rate compared with groups A and B (6 months, 5%; 12 months, 6%; 24 months, 0%) and no EII-related reintervention.\nThis randomized study confirms that sac embolization during EVAR, using a sac volume-dependent dose of fibrin glue and coils, is a valid method to significantly reduce EII and its complications during early and midterm follow-up in patients considered at risk. Although further confirmatory studies are needed, the faster aneurysm sac volume shrinkage over time in patients who underwent embolization compared with standard EVAR may be a positive aspect influencing the lower EII rate also during long-term follow-up.",

    "abstract": "A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) is associated with a high mortality rate. If cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is required before surgical repair, mortality rates are said to approach 100%. The aim of this multicenter, retrospective study was to study outcome in RAAA patients who required CPR before a surgical (endovascular or open) repair (CPR group). RAAA patients who did not need CPR served as controls (non-CPR group).\nOver a 5-year time period, demographic and clinical characteristics and specifics of preoperative CPR if necessary were studied in all patients who were treated for a RAAA in three large, nonacademic hospitals.\nA total of 199 consecutive RAAA patients were available for analysis; 176 patients were surgically treated. Thirteen of these 176 patients (7.4%) needed CPR, and 163 (92.6%) did not. A 38.5% (5 of 13) survival rate was observed in the CPR group. Thirty-day mortality was almost three times greater in the CPR group compared with the non-CPR group (61.5% vs 22.7%; P = .005). Both CPR patients who received endovascular aortic repair survived. In contrast, survival in 11 CPR patients who underwent open RAAA repair was 27% (3 of 11; P = .128). A trend for higher Hardman index was found in patients who received CPR compared with patients who did not receive CPR (P = .052). The 30-day mortality in patients with a 0, 1, 2, or 3 Hardman index was 16.1%, 31.0%, 37.9%, and 33.3%, respectively (P = .093).\nAn RAAA that requires preoperative CPR is not necessarily a lethal combination. Patient selection must be tailored before surgery is denied.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with aortic dissection develop Crawford extent I or II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). Because open repair is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, hybrid approaches to TAAA repair are emerging. In this study, we evaluated the midterm outcomes and aortic remodeling of a hybrid technique that combines proximal thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR), followed by staged distal open thoracoabdominal repair for patients with Crawford extent I or II TAAAs secondary to chronic aortic dissection.\nWe identified 19 patients with Crawford extent I (n = 1) or extent II (n = 18) TAAAs secondary to chronic aortic dissection who underwent a staged hybrid repair from 2007 to 2014 at our institution. Nine patients had previous open ascending aortic surgery for type I aortic dissection. Stage 1 TEVAR was performed via percutaneous (n = 8), femoral cutdown (n = 8), or iliac exposure (n = 3). The left subclavian artery was covered in nine patients and revascularized in eight patients using carotid-subclavian bypass (n = 7) or laser fenestration (n = 1). Stage 2 open repair was performed a median of 18 weeks later with partial cardiopulmonary bypass via left femoral arterial and venous cannulation for visceral and lower body perfusion. The open thoracoabdominal graft was anastomosed proximally in an end to end fashion with the endograft. We then assessed surgical morbidity and mortality, midterm survival, and freedom from reintervention. Aortic remodeling was measured and change in maximum aortic and false lumen diameter at last follow-up (median, 3 years) from baseline was assessed.\nThere were no deaths, strokes, or chronic renal failure in this cohort. After stage 1 TEVAR, three patients required repeat intervention for endoleak (type Ia, n = 1; type Ib, n = 1; type II, n = 1) before open repair. After stage 2 open repair, there was a single delayed permanent paralysis 2 weeks after discharge. At a median 3-year follow-up (range, 6 months-6.2 years), there were no deaths, neurologic events, endoleaks, or TAAA reinterventions. Complete false lumen thrombosis occurred in 100% of the patients, with maximum false lumen diameter decreasing from 34.3 \u00b1 15.3 mm to 13.2 \u00b1 12.0 mm (P < .01) and total aortic diameter decreasing from 60.2 \u00b1 9.0 mm to 49.4 \u00b1 9.6 mm (P < .01).\nStaged hybrid TAAA repair, using a combination of proximal TEVAR with open distal repair, can be performed using established endovascular skills and technology coupled with traditional open aortic surgical techniques, with low surgical morbidity and mortality. In the midterm, staged hybrid TAAA repair was associated favorable survival, aortic remodeling, and freedom from reintervention.",

    "abstract": "The outcomes of open surgical or endovascular intervention for limb-threatening ischemia (LTI) involving the infrapopliteal vessels are dependent on complex anatomic, demographic, and disease factors. To assist in decision-making, we used the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) to derive a model using only preoperatively available factors to predict important outcomes for open or endovascular revascularization.\nNational VQI data for the infrainguinal bypass and peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) modules were reviewed in a blinded fashion for patients who underwent intervention for LTI of the infrapopliteal vessels. Primary outcomes consisted of major adverse limb event (MALE) and amputation-free survival (AFS). Generalized linear modeling was used for the multivariate analyses, with entry of variables dependent on results of univariate analysis.\nFrom January 2003 through August 2014 a total of 19,053 infrainguinal open bypass and 48,739 PVI procedures were identified, among which 5264 and 5252, respectively, represented infrapopliteal (tibial-peroneal-pedal) revascularization for LTI. From these, 3036 infrapopliteal open bypass patients and 1319 infrapopliteal PVI patients had sufficient follow-up data for study inclusion. For open surgery, the reduced generalized linear model revealed that American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 or 5, previous major amputation, living at home, and female sex had the greatest adverse effect on MALE, and dialysis dependence, low body mass index, and lack of great saphenous vein as a conduit had the greatest negative effect on AFS. For PVI, lesion length from 10 to 15 cm, treatment of three or more arteries, and classification other than A on the Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus demonstrated the largest adverse effects on MALE, and dialysis dependence, low body mass index, and congestive heart failure most negatively affected AFS.\nThis study on a cross-section of patients selected for intervention in academic and community hospitals offers a \"real world\" glimpse of factors predictive of outcome. The VQI can be used to derive models that predict the outcomes of open surgical bypass or PVI for LTI involving the infrapopliteal vessels.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for select patients with carotid atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that the choice of CAS vs CEA varies as a function of treating physician specialty, which would result in regional variation in the relative use of these treatment types.\nWe used Medicare claims (2002-2010) to calculate annual rates of CAS and CEA and examined changes by procedure type over time. To assess regional preferences surrounding CAS, we calculated the proportion of revascularizations by CAS, across hospital referral regions, defined according to the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare. We then examined relationships between patient factors, physician specialty, and regional use of CAS.\nThe annual number of all carotid revascularization procedures decreased by 30% from 2002 to 2010 (3.2 to 2.3 per 1000; P = .005). Whereas rates of CEA declined by 35% during these 8 years (3.0 to 1.9 per 1000; P < .001), CAS utilization increased by 5% during the same interval (0.30 to 0.32 per 1000; P = .014). Variation in utilization of carotid revascularization varied across the Unites States, with some regions performing as few as 0.7 carotid procedure per 1000 beneficiaries (Honolulu, Hawaii) and others performing nearly 8 times as many (5.3 per 1000 in Houma, La). Variation in procedure type (CEA vs CAS) was evident as well, as the proportion of carotid revascularization procedures that were constituted by CAS varied from 0% (Casper, Wyo, and Meridian, Miss) to 53% (Bend, Ore). The majority of CAS procedures were performed by cardiologists (49% of all CAS cases), who doubled their rates of CAS during the study period from 0.07 per 1000 in 2002 to 0.15 per 1000 in 2010.\nVariation in rates of carotid revascularization exists. Whereas rates of carotid revascularization have declined by more than 30% in recent years, utilization of CAS has increased. The proportion of all carotid revascularization procedures performed as CAS varies markedly by geographic region, and regions with the highest proportion of cardiologists perform the most CAS procedures. Evidence-based guidelines for carotid revascularization will require a multidisciplinary approach to ensure uniform adoption across specialties that care for patients with carotid artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Livedo reticularis (LR) is a reticulated discoloration of the skin, particularly on lower extremities. Few treatment options are reported. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of chemical lumbar sympathectomy (CLS) in idiopathic LR. The key technique points of CLS are also illustrated in detail.\nPatients with idiopathic LR with a strong desire for treatment were recruited during a 2.5-year period. L3-4 CLSs were performed with 5% phenol (2 mL) in each injection site. The needle tip extends to approximately one-third of the vertical dividing line of the vertebral body. The contrast along the psoas muscle fibers indicates targeting on gray rami communicans instead of the sympathetic trunk. The primary efficacy variable was achieving \"clear or almost clear\" of LR lesions staying >1 hour in a 24\u00b0C air-conditioned room. Safety assessments included monitoring and recording of all adverse events and tolerability to treatment. The follow-up period was 2.5 to 4.7 years.\nTen women (median age, 22 years) were enrolled. Seven patients achieved \"clear or almost clear\" of LR lesions after CLS. The postoperative skin surface temperature increase was 7.4\u00b0C \u00b1 2.6\u00b0C. Two patients achieved \"major partially resolved,\" and one patient achieved \"minor partially resolved.\" Two of the seven with \"clear or almost clear\" results reported recurrence \u22641 year during the follow-up, CLS was repeated, and they then achieved \"clear or almost clear\" again. Two patients reported mild pain localized to the thigh area, which resolved spontaneously by the second day.\nThis study showed CLS provides a valid option for the treatment of idiopathic LR. The efficacy of CLS can be long-lasting, and CLS can be repeated if LR recurs. Targeting at gray rami communicans, rather than the sympathetic trunk, is comparably effective and safer for sympathetic interruption.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the value of modern medical treatment (MMT) with and without carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis.\nWe conducted a randomized trial involving 55 patients with 70% to 79% carotid stenosis at three Russian centers. Between 2009 and 2013, 31 patients were randomized to undergo CEA with MMT (CEA group) and 24 to receive MMT alone. The primary end point was nonfatal ipsilateral stroke or death from any cause during a follow-up period of 5.0 years. The secondary end point was any nonfatal stroke, carotid revascularization, or death from any cause during follow-up.\nThe trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 3.3 years (maximum, 5.0 years).

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are rare neoplasms. Complete surgical resection is the curative therapy and is considered the therapeutic gold standard. This study compared the retrocarotid dissection (RCD) technique with the standard caudocranial dissection (SCCD) technique in operative time, blood loss, vascular or nerve injuries, and hospital stay.\nA retrospective review was conducted of patients with CBTs who underwent surgical treatment with the RCD technique at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition \"Salvador Zubir\u00e1n\" in Mexico City from July 2007 to January 2013. This cohort was compared with an historical cohort treated with standard SCCD from 1995 to 2007 at the same institution.\nA total of 68 procedures (41 SCCD, 27 RCD) were performed in 68 patients (91% women) with a mean age of 54 years (standard deviation [SD], 15 years). According to the Shamblin classification, 6 CBTs were type I (9%), 35 were type II (51%), and 27 were type III (40%). Comparative analysis identified mean blood loss of 480 mL (SD, 380 mL) in the RCD group and 690 mL (SD, 680 mL) for the SCCD cohort (P < .31). The mean procedural time was 172 minutes (SD, 60 minutes) for the RCD group and 260 minutes (SD, 100 minutes) for the SCCD group (P < .001). Hospital stay was significantly shorter for the RCD group with an average of 5 days (SD, 2 days) compared with 9 days (SD, 6 days) for the SCCD cohort (P < .0001). Cranial nerve deficit occurred in 17 patients, consisting of six transient nerve palsies in the RCD cohort and 11 in the SCCD group. Postoperative cerebrovascular accidents occurred in three patients in the SCCD cohort, with none observed in the RCD group. This translates into a rate of 22% of postoperative neurologic complications for the RCD cohort and 34% in the SCCD group (P < .08). Significant differences in intraoperative vascular injuries were not observed.\nThe RCD technique is a safe and viable option for the surgical resection of CBTs. In our experience, this approach was associated with a significant decrease in procedural time and hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Low-profile (LP) stent grafts are now commercially available in Europe for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). In this study the midterm outcomes and characteristics of patients treated with this last generation of stent grafts were compared with a cohort of patients treated with \"standard-profile\" (SP) stent grafts.\nThe current study enrolled all patients treated for elective EVAR by the SP Zenith Flex stent graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) between March 2010 and November 2011 and patients treated for elective EVAR by the Zenith LP stent graft (Cook Medical) between November 2011 and March 2013. All patients had a follow-up >18 months. Preoperative computed tomography angiograms were analyzed on a dedicated three-dimensional workstation. All data were prospectively collected in an electronic database and retrospectively analyzed. A comparative study was conducted.\nThe present study included 208 patients (107 SP and 101 LP). Patients' physiologic characteristics were similar in both groups. The iliac anatomy was considered \"more challenging\" in LP patients: respectively, 7% and 22% (P = .002) of SP and LP patients had bilateral external iliac diameter <7 mm; and 16% and 34% (P = .005) had a combination of an external iliac diameter <7 mm and an iliac tortuosity ratio index >1.5. No 30-day deaths were documented. The 24-month freedom from reintervention and overall survival rates after SP and LP were, respectively, 88% and 91% (P = .450) and 92% and 96% (P = .153). The 24-month rates for freedom from sac expansion and from limb occlusion were 96.4% and 98.7% (P = .320) and 92% and 95% (P = .293), respectively. One patient in each group presented with a type I endoleak during follow-up, and two LP patients presented with a type III endoleak (P = .235).\nThis study demonstrates that the last-generation LP stent grafts have favorable midterm outcomes similar to SP stent grafts despite being used to treat more patients with unfavorable iliac anatomy.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes the DEDE (Door-from-Emergency to Door-to-EVAR [endovascular aneurysm repair]) time as a new metric for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) delay time to surgery, permitting coherent centralization in large territories. It demonstrates how the DEDE time can be applied, using data from the province of Quebec, and looks at its potential effect on 30-day mortality.\nWe used the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS), the linkage of five health administrative databases, to build a retrospective cohort of RAAA patients repaired operatively between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2013. A validated algorithm was used to identify open surgical repair (OSR) and EVAR patients. Hospitals performing these operations were further characterized according to their location, volume of RAAA, types of surgeries (OSR vs EVAR), and surgeon's volume. Logistic and log-binomial regression analyses identified the risk of 30-day mortality with age, sex, hospital volume, and surgical groups as variables. Using the DEDE 90 metric and the attributable fraction, we projected how centralization and increasing the number of EVAR would affect the 30-day mortality.\nAmong patients aged \u226565 years, 895 RAAAs were identified. OSR was performed in 839 patients (93.7%) and EVAR in 56 (6.3%). The overall 30-day mortality was 34.4%, and more specifically, was 35.5% for OSR compared with 17.9% for EVAR (P = .0046). RAAAs were treated in 39 hospitals, including 16 centers averaging less than one RAAA repair per year. Low-volume (39.4%) vs high-volume centers (32.5%) had similar 30-day mortality (P = .2198). In the multivariate analysis, the relative risk for OSR was 1.95 (P = .0211) and was not significant for hospital volume. Applying the DEDE 90 metric and increasing access to EVAR to 50% of patients, the overall 30-day mortality would be 26.8%.\nDEDE 90 is a new metric for a coherent centralization model, particularly in large territories, where transport time is crucial. Increasing access to EVAR performed in high-volume centers, with consideration to transport time, could improve the 30-day mortality after a RAAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated stent grafts are subject to the same hemodynamic forces that have resulted in migration of standard infrarenal stent grafts. Outcome data for fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair consist of short-term and midterm efficacy studies where migration was generally poorly investigated. This study investigated the migration of fenestrated stent grafts in patients treated by fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair in the United Kingdom.\nA total of 154 patients were retrospectively enrolled from nine sites across the United Kingdom. Patients had been treated with a Zenith fenestrated endograft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) between 2003 and 2010. Patients were required to have a baseline (first) postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan and at least one additional CT scan available. Measurements from the proximal stent graft to the superior mesenteric artery and from the distal stent graft to the iliac bifurcation were performed on the first postoperative CT scan. These measurements were repeated on all subsequent CT scans, and differences between the baseline and subsequent CT scans for the same anatomical location were suggestive of device migration. Migration was defined as cranial (-) or caudal (+) movement of the stent graft of \u22654 mm.\nProximal migration (median, +6.0 mm; range, +4.1 to +10.0 mm) was evident in 33 patients (21%). The probability of being free from proximal migration at 12, 24, and 36 months was estimated as 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75%-89%), 77% (95% CI, 70%-85%), and 77% (95% CI, 70%-85%), respectively. Of 259 limbs assessed, 34 (13%) showed evidence of cranial migration (median, -6.1 mm; range, -21.3 to -4.1 mm). The observed probability of being free from any iliac limb migration at 12, 24, and 36 months was 85% (95% CI, 79%-92%), 82% (95% CI, 75%-90%), and 65% (95% CI, 52%-80%), respectively.\nProximal migration occurs in approximately one-third of patients by 4 years, all migration was caudal in direction, with 60% <6.0 mm in length. Clinical sequelae were infrequent, with no statistically significant differences in the number of complications or reinterventions in patients with and without proximal migration.",

    "abstract": "As vascular surgery training paradigms evolve, one measure of success is operative experience. This study assessed the initial operative experience of those graduating from new integrated programs (0+5) vs those from the traditional programs (5+2).\nNational operative case log data supplied by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education was compiled for vascular surgical residents graduating between 2010 and 2013. Mean case numbers for the 0+5 residents were compared with those for the 5+2 residents (experience from their general surgery residency plus vascular fellowship) for total vascular operations, open vascular operations, endovascular procedures, and total operative experience.\nThe 5+2 trainees performed significantly more procedures than the 0+5 trainees (mean, 1605 vs 1015); however, they performed 12% less vascular procedures (mean, 758 vs 851). No significant differences in total number of open vascular operations (mean, 404 vs 411) or specific open operations for cerebral vascular disease, aneurysm, peripheral obstruction, and access were found. The increase in vascular procedures logged by 0+5 trainees was realized by a 24% increase in endovascular procedures, mainly involving diagnostic arteriography, caval filter placement, and balloon angioplasty. No significant differences were seen in endovascular aneurysm repair (mean, 63 vs 60) and stent placement (mean, 59 vs 60).\nThis report summarizes the first data available for the 0+5 trainee operative experience. Compared with the traditional 5+2 trainees, the 0+5 trainees have (1) equivalent open vascular training and (2) overall superior endovascular training, although this was accounted via an increase in minor procedures. The overall operative experience remains greater for the 5+2 trainees secondary to 2 extra years of training. Further longitudinal studies will be needed to fully characterize the effect of the new 0+5 training paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to characterize the predictive impact of computed tomography (CT) scan volumetric analysis on the natural history of acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissections (ADs).\nWe conducted a retrospective review of patients with acute type B ADs from 2009 to 2014. On an iNtuition workstation (TeraRecon, Foster City, Calif), volume measurements were obtained using the true lumen volume (TLV), false lumen volume (FLV), and total aortic volume from the left subclavian artery to the celiac artery. Growth rate was calculated as the change in maximal diameter between first and last available CT scans during the time interval. The primary outcome of the study was delayed aortic intervention. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.\nDuring a 5-year period, 164 patients had CT scan evidence of acute type B ADs; 11 patients were excluded for lack of subsequent follow-up imaging; 36 patients who underwent urgent repair (<14 days from presentation) were also excluded. We evaluated a total of 117 patients: 85 patients who did not require intervention and 32 who underwent delayed (>14 days) thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (29) or open repair (3). Mean age was 66 \u00b1 12 years. Mean TLV/FLV ratio on initial CT scan was significantly higher in patients who did not eventually require an operation (1.55 vs 0.82; P = .02). The mean growth rate was higher in those eventually requiring operation (2.47 vs 0.42 mm/mo; P = .003). Patients were divided into three subgroups on the basis of their initial imaging TLV/FLV ratios (<0.8, 0.8-1.6, and >1.6). There was a significant difference in the growth rates between these three groups (4.6 vs 2.4 vs 0.8 mm/mo; P < .025). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a TLV/FLV ratio <0.8 was highly predictive for requiring an intervention (area = 0.8; sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 84%: positive predictive value, 71%; negative predictive value, 81%), with an odds ratio of 12.2 (confidence interval, 5-26; P < .001). Conversely, a TLV/FLV ratio of >1.6 was highly predictive for freedom from delayed operation (sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 42%; positive predictive value, 61%; negative predictive value, 86%). After Kaplan-Meier analysis, 1-year and 2-year survival free of aortic interventions was 60% and 42% with a TLV/FLV ratio <0.8 and 92% and 82% with a ratio >1.6 (P = .001).\nInitial CT scan volumetric analysis in patients presenting with uncomplicated acute type B ADs is a useful tool to predict growth and need for future intervention.",

    "abstract": "Patients who undergo endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease vary greatly in lesion complexity and treatment options. This study examined the association of lesion severity and cost of SFA stenting and to determine if procedure cost affects primary patency at 1 year.\nA retrospective record review identified patients undergoing initial SFA stenting between January 1, 2010, and February 1, 2012. Medical records were reviewed to collect data on demographics, comorbidities, indication for the procedure, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II severity, and primary patency. The interventional radiology database and hospital accounting database were queried to determine cost drivers of SFA stenting. Procedure supply cost included any item with a bar code used for the procedure. Associations between cost drivers and lesion characteristics were explored. Primary patency was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a log-rank test.\nDuring the study period, 95 patients underwent stenting in 98 extremities; of these, 61% of SFA stents were performed for claudication, with 80% of lesions classified as TASC II A or B. Primary patency at 1 year was 79% for the entire cohort. The mean total cost per case was $10,333. Increased procedure supply cost was associated with adjunct device use, the number of stents, and TASC II severity. Despite higher costs of treating more complex lesions, primary patency at 1 year was similar at 80% for high-cost (supply cost >$4000) vs 78% for low-cost (supply cost <$4000) interventions.\nSFA lesion complexity, as defined by TASC II severity, drives the cost of endovascular interventions but does not appear to disadvantage patency at 1 year. Reimbursement agencies should consider incorporating disease severity into reimbursement algorithms for lower extremity endovascular interventions.",

Primary patency at 1 year was 79% for the entire cohort. The mean total cost per case was $10,333. Increased procedure supply cost was associated with adjunct device use, the number of stents, and TASC II severity. Despite higher costs of treating more complex lesions, primary patency at 1 year was similar at 80% for high-cost (supply cost >$4000) vs 78% for low-cost (supply cost <$4000) interventions.",

    "abstract": "Acceptable complication rates after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are drawn from decades-old data. The recent Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) demonstrated improved stroke and mortality outcomes after CEA compared with carotid artery stenting, with 30-day periprocedural CEA stroke rates of 3.2% and 1.4% for symptomatic (SX) and asymptomatic (ASX) patients, respectively. It is unclear whether these target rates can be attained in \"normal-risk\" (NR) patients experienced outside of the trial. This study was done to determine the contemporary results of CEA from a broader selection of NR patients.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Vascular Registry was examined to determine in-hospital and 30-day event rates for NR, SX, and ASX patients undergoing CEA. NR was defined as patients without anatomic or physiologic risk factors as defined by SVS Carotid Practice Guidelines. Raw data and risk-adjusted rates of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) were compared between the ASX and SX cohorts.\nThere were 3977 patients (1456 SX, 2521 ASX) available for comparison. The SX group consisted of more men (61.7% vs 57.0%; P = .0045) but reflected a lower proportion of white patients (91.3% vs 94.4%; P = .0002), with lower prevalence of coronary artery disease (P < .0001), prior MI (P < .0001), peripheral vascular disease (P = .0017), and hypertension (P = .029), although New York Heart Association grade >3 congestive heart failure was equally present in both groups (P = .30). Baseline stenosis >80% on duplex imaging was less prevalent among SX patients (54.2% vs 67.8%; P < .0001). Perioperative stroke rates were higher for SX patients in the hospital (2.8% vs 0.8%; P < .0001) and at 30 days (3.4% vs 1.0%; P < .0001), which contributed to the higher composite death, stroke, and MI rates in the hospital (3.6% vs 1.8; P = .0003) and at 30 days (4.5% vs 2.2%; P < .0001) observed in SX patients. After risk adjustment, the rate of stroke/death was greater among SX patients in the hospital (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.58) although not at 30 days (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-2.17). No in-hospital or 30-day differences were observed for death or MI by symptom status.\nThe SVS Vascular Registry results for CEA in NR patients are similar by symptom status to those reported for CREST and may serve as a benchmark for comparing results of alternative therapies for treatment of carotid stenosis in NR patients outside of monitored clinical trials. The contemporary perioperative risk of stroke after CEA in NR patients continues to be higher for SX than for ASX patients.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is growing in global prevalence and is associated with high rates of limb loss and mortality. However, a relevant gap of evidence about the most optimal treatment strategy still exists. The aim of this study of the prospective, multicenter First-Line Treatments in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (CRITISCH) registry was to assess the current practice of all first-line treatments strategies in CLI patients in German vascular centers.\nBetween January 2013 and September 2014, five first-line treatment strategies-endovascular revascularization (ER), bypass surgery (BS), femoral/profundal artery patchplasty (FAP), conservative treatment, and primary amputation-were determined among CLI patients in 27 vascular tertiary centers. The main composite end point was major amputation or death, or both, during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were hemodynamic failure, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events, and reintervention. Univariate logistic models were additionally built to preselect possible risk factors for either event, which were then used as candidates for a multivariate logistic model.\nThe study included 1200 consecutive patients. First-line treatment of choice was ER in 642 patients (53.4%), BS in 284 (23.7%), FAP in 126 (10.5%), conservative treatment in 118 (9.8%), and primary amputation in 30 (2.5%). The composite end point was met in 24 patients (4%) after ER, in 17 (6%) after BS, in 8 (6%) after FAP, and in 9 (8%) after conservative treatment (P = .172). The highest rate of in-hospital death was observed after primary amputation (10%) and of hemodynamic failure after conservative treatment (91%). Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events developed in 4% of patients after ER, in 5% after BS, in 6% after FAP, in 5% after conservative treatment, and in 13% after primary amputation. The reintervention rate was 8%, 14%, 6%, 5%, and 3% in each group, respectively. In the multivariate regression model, coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-6.17) and previous myocardial infarction (PMI) <6 months (OR, 3.67, 95% CI, 1.51-8.88) were identified as risk factors for the composite end point. Risk factors for amputation were dialysis (OR, 3.31, 95% CI, 1.44-7.58) and PMI (OR, 3.26, 95% CI, 1.23-8.36) and for death, BS compared with ER (OR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.10-10.0), renal insufficiency without dialysis (OR, 6.34; 95% CI, 1.71-23.5), and PMI (OR, 7.41; 95% CI, 2.11-26.0).\nThe CRITISCH registry revealed ER as the most common first-line approach in CLI patients. Coronary artery disease and PMI <6 months were independent risk factors for the composite end point. Special attention should be also paid to CLI patients with renal insufficiency, with or without dialysis, and those undergoing BS.",

    "abstract": "Single-center experiences with the treatment of infected endografts after endovascular aortic repair (I-EVAR) have been reported. We performed a multicenter review of the surgical care of these patients to elucidate short-term and long-term outcomes.\nA retrospective analysis of all EVAR explants from 1997 to 2014 at four institutions was performed. Patients with I-EVAR undergoing surgical treatment were reviewed. Data were obtained detailing preoperative demographics, and postoperative morbidity and mortality.\nThirty-six patients (30 male) were treated with endovascular graft excision and revascularization for I-EVAR with a median age of 69 years (range, 54-80 years). Average time from the initial EVAR to presentation was 589 days (range, 43-2466 days). Preoperative comorbidities included hypertension, 32 (89%); tobacco use, 31(86%); coronary artery disease, 26 (72%); hyperlipidemia, 25 (69%), peripheral artery disease, 13 (36%); cerebrovascular disease, 10 (28%); diabetes, 10 (28%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 9 (25%); and chronic kidney disease, 9 (25%). The most common presenting patient characteristics were leukocytosis, 23 (63%); pain, 21 (58%); and fever, 20 (56%), which were present an average of 65 days (range, 0-514 days) before explantation. Nine different types of endograft were removed. Three patients (8%) underwent emergency explantation. Thirty-four patients (89%) underwent total graft excision, and two patients (6%) underwent partial excision. Methods of reconstruction were in situ in 27 (75%) and extra-anatomic in nine (28%). Conduits used were Dacron (DuPont, Wilmington, Del), with or without rifampin, polytetrafluoroethylene, cryopreserved allograft, and femoral vein. Forty-nine organisms grew from operative cultures. Gram-positive organisms were the most common, found in 24 (67%), including Staphylococcus in 13 (36%) and Streptococcus in six (17%). Anaerobes were cultured in 6 patients (17%), gram-negative organisms in 6 (17%), and fungus in 5 (14%). Thirty-one patients (86%) received long-term antibiotics. Early complications included acute renal failure requiring dialysis, 12 (33%); respiratory failure, 3 (8%); bleeding, 4 (11%); and sepsis, 2 (6%). Six patients required re-exploration due to hematoma, infected hematoma, lymphatic leak, bowel perforation, open abdomen at initial operation, and anastomotic bleeding. Perioperative mortality was 8% (3 of 36), and long-term mortality was 25% (9 of 36) at a mean follow-up of 569 days (range, 0-3079 days). Type of reconstruction (in situ vs extra-anatomic) or conduit type did not affect perioperative or overall mortality.\nI-EVAR is a rare but potentially devastating clinical problem. Although perioperative mortality is acceptable, long-term mortality is high. The most common postoperative complication was acute renal failure requiring dialysis. Although this is the largest series of I-EVAR, further studies are needed to understand the risk factors and preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid aortic arch reconstruction represents a treatment option for patients unsuitable for conventional open cardiovascular surgery. We analyzed patient outcome after hemiarch repair in zone 1 and zone 2 with regard to early and long-term results.\nBetween December 2004 and December 2012, a total of 47 patients underwent hemiarch repair for distal aortic arch disease. Supra-aortic debranching was performed in 23 patients for zone 1 (carotid-carotid crossover bypass) and in 24 patients for zone 2 (carotid-subclavian bypass/subclavian transposition) followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair. All patients included had been refused for open surgery or were emergency cases.\nMean age of the patients was 65.3 years; 51% of patients were symptomatic or presented with a contained aortic rupture. Overall technical success rate was 81%, with a 30-day mortality rate of 12.8%. A primary type Ia endoleak was observed in 19%. The mean follow-up period was 50.5 months (range, 1-93 months). Follow-up mortality was 14.9%; secondary endoleak rate was 8.5% for both groups. There was a trend of reduced primary type Ia endoleak rate for zone 2 repair compared with zone 1 (4.3% vs 14.9%; P = .07). Follow-up mortality was also improved for zone 2 repair (4.3% vs 10.6%; P = .41). Overall survival rate was 70%.\nHemiarch hybrid repair in high-risk patients is associated with an acceptable perioperative mortality risk and long-term survival. Zone 2 represents a feasible and effective treatment option for hybrid arch repair. Zone 1 is related with relevant risk for type Ia endoleak and higher mortality during follow-up. Lifelong surveillance after hybrid repair is essential.",

    "abstract": "Screening for common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis with duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity criteria alone can be limited by within-patient and between-patients hemodynamic variability. This study aimed to evaluate inter-CCA velocity ratio criteria to predict high-grade CCA stenosis.\nThis was a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent computed tomography angiography and DUS peak systolic velocity (PSV) measurements of bilateral CCAs, independently recorded, between 2008 and 2014. Patients with dampened CCA waveforms on DUS composed group B. The remainder without dampened waveforms constituted group A. Inter-CCA PSV ratios were calculated by dividing the higher CCA PSV by the lower one of the other side, so the ratios would always be \u22651. Ratios were subsequently paired with each respective unilateral CCA diameter stenosis and differential bilateral CCA diameter stenosis. A quadratic regression model was fitted to predict unilateral and differential stenosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine optimal ratios for \u226550% and \u226580% CCA stenosis. The study excluded patients with carotid artery occlusion.\nFrom a total of 201 patients, 193 patients were included in group A and 8 in group B. Within group A, 31 patients had \u226550% unilateral stenosis and 17 had \u226550% differential stenosis. All stenoses \u226550% were identified on the same side with the higher PSV. Inter-CCA PSV ratio predicted \u226550% unilateral (r(2) = 0.536; P < .001) and differential stenosis (r(2) = 0.581; P < .001). In group B, all patients had \u226560% stenosis that was near or involved the vessel origin. An increasing inter-CCA PSV ratio showed a trend toward contralateral high-grade stenosis (r(2) = 0.596; P = .1). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed an optimal threshold CCA ratio \u22652.16 for \u226550% unilateral stenosis with 92% accuracy, 62% sensitivity, and 98% specificity (area under curve = 0.854; 95% confidence interval, 0.759-0.948) and a ratio \u22652.62 for \u226550% differential stenosis with 97% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, and 98% specificity (area under curve = 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.835-1).\nDUS-based CCA PSV ratio can accurately predict unilateral and differential high-grade CCA stenosis. Also, in patients with unilateral dampened waveforms, it implied contralateral severe proximal stenosis. This parameter should be further validated in prospective studies and may serve as an adjunct screening tool to detect high-grade CCA stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common postoperative complications after vascular reconstruction, producing significant morbidity and hospital readmission. In contrast to SSI that develops while patients are still hospitalized, little is known about the cohort of patients who develop SSI after discharge. In this study, we explore the factors that lead to postdischarge SSI, investigate the differences between risk factors for in-hospital vs postdischarge SSI, and develop a scoring system to identify patients who might benefit from postdischarge monitoring of their wounds.\nPatients who underwent major vascular surgery from 2005 to 2012 for aneurysm and lower extremity occlusive disease were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files. Patients were categorized as having no SSI, in-hospital SSI, or SSI after hospital discharge. Predictors of postdischarge SSI were determined by multivariable logistic regression and internally validated by bootstrap resampling. Risk scores were assigned to all significant variables in the model. Summative risk scores were collapsed into quartile-based ordinal categories and defined as low, low/moderate, moderate/high, and high risk. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of in-hospital SSI.\nOf the 49,817 patients who underwent major vascular surgery, 4449 (8.9%) were diagnosed with SSI (2.1% in-hospital SSI; 6.9% postdischarge SSI). By multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with increased odds of postdischarge SSI include female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, neurologic disease, prolonged operative time >4 hours, American Society of Anesthesiology class 4 or 5, lower extremity revascularization or aortoiliac procedure, and groin anastomosis. The model exhibited moderate discrimination (bias-corrected C statistic, 0.691) and excellent internal calibration. The postdischarge SSI rate was 2.1% for low-risk patients, 5.1% for low/moderate-risk patients, 7.8% for moderate/high-risk patients, and 14% for high-risk patients. In a comparative analysis, comorbidities were the primary driver of postdischarge SSI, whereas in-hospital factors (operative time, emergency case status) and complications predicted in-hospital SSI.\nThe majority of SSIs after major vascular surgery develop following hospital discharge. We have created a scoring system that can select a cohort of patients at high risk for SSI after discharge. These patients can be targeted for transitional care efforts focused on early detection and treatment with the goal of reducing morbidity and preventing readmission secondary to SSI.",

    "abstract": "Junctional component separation producing type IIIa endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an uncommon but serious complication requiring unanticipated reinterventions. This retrospective study analyzed main-body EVAR component uncoupling and type IIIa endoleaks encountered with Powerlink and AFX (Endologix Inc, Irvine, Calif) endografts during an 8-year period.\nType IIIa endoleaks were identified from a database of secondary interventions and clinical surveillance. Operative reports, medical records, and computed tomography studies were reviewed. Clinical and imaging characteristics were analyzed over time, and differences were compared at appropriate follow-up intervals.\nSince 2006, 701 patients underwent primary EVAR using Endologix Powerlink (352 patients, 2006-2011) or AFX (349 patients, 2011-2014) endografts. Endoleaks required 32 secondary interventions (4.6%), including type Ia in 4 patients (1 proximal extension and 3 explants); type Ib in 8 patients (all distal extensions for enlarging iliac aneurysms); type II in 1 patient (explant); type IIIa in 17 patients (2.4%), who were the subject of this report; and type IIIb in 2 patients (both EVAR relining). The 17 patients with type IIIa endoleak were an average age of 71 years, and 14 (82%) were men. The mean preoperative abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter was 70 \u00b1 18 mm. The repair was elective in 16 patients and an emergency in one. Ten cases were performed with Powerlink and seven with AFX. Analysis of serial computed tomography scans found significant changes in AAA diameter; renal-to-bifurcation straight-line, centerline, and greater curvature lengths; EVAR angulation; and loss of EVAR component overlap. The average time from EVAR to reintervention was 32 months. Three patients returned with a ruptured AAA and three with AAA thrombosis, and three of these patients (18%) died \u226430 days of the emergency reintervention. Secondary procedures included EVAR relining with additional bridging components in 14 patients (82%), explant in 2, and axillobifemoral bypass in 1. No new cases of endograft uncoupling have been identified in patients treated with AFX since December 2012 after adoption of revised instructions for use.\nAlthough a small number of secondary interventions were needed after EVAR with the Endologix Powerlink or AFX endografts, most were undertaken for late main-body component uncoupling and type IIIa endoleak, which can occur after sideways displacement of the endograft in large and angulated AAAs. Patients treated before 2013 under the old instructions for use should be evaluated for signs of impending component separation and monitored annually, noting that expected indicators of endograft failure, such as increasing AAA diameter and endoleak, may be absent.",

    "abstract": "Developing patient-centered approaches to health care requires increased engagement of patients in their own care, including treatment decisions. Current levels of patient involvement in treatment choices have not been quantified, however, and whether patients desire greater decision-making responsibility is unknown. We conducted a prospective study to explore patients' desired vs experienced roles in treatment decisions, characterize perceptions of treatment outcomes, and identify important sources of information.\nPatients undergoing elective vascular procedures completed a survey consisting of multiple choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. Statistics are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or count (%). Differences among procedure categories were evaluated using \u03c7(2) or the Fisher exact test at P < .05 based on responses scored 1 to 2, indicating importance, agreement, or satisfaction based on a 1 to 5 Likert scale where 1 = \"very important,\" \"strongly agree\" or \"very satisfied\".\nOf 101 patients who were contacted, 81 participated. Procedure categories included abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in 20, arteriovenous (AV) hemodialysis access in 21, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 20, and intervention for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 20. Participants preferred discussion of all treatments being considered vs only the provider's recommended treatment (90% vs 56%) and choosing together with the provider vs having the provider choose for them (93% vs 62%). Although participants indicated adequate information to ask questions without feeling overwhelmed, only 77% agreed that they had the opportunity to ask questions and only 54% indicated that they were offered a choice. Thirty-seven participants (46%) considered their first treatment was successful, 38% considered a subsequent treatment was successful, and 16% considered none of their treatments were successful. Participants undergoing PAD and AV access procedures most often felt confused or overwhelmed (25% and 24%, respectively, vs 0% for AAA and CEA; P < .01). Patients with PAD had adequate information least often (70% vs 85% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P = .01), had the lowest satisfaction with understanding of their diagnosis (65% vs 95% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P < .01), and most often considered none of their treatments successful (35% vs 0% for AAA, 15% for AV access, and 15% for CEA; P = .02). Providers were identified as the most important information source.\nPatients have variable levels of participation in decision making related to vascular procedures and often consider their treatments unsuccessful. Although providers are important sources of information, patients still prefer to discuss all options being considered and contribute to shared decision making.",

Participants preferred discussion of all treatments being considered vs only the provider's recommended treatment (90% vs 56%) and choosing together with the provider vs having the provider choose for them (93% vs 62%). Although participants indicated adequate information to ask questions without feeling overwhelmed, only 77% agreed that they had the opportunity to ask questions and only 54% indicated that they were offered a choice. Thirty-seven participants (46%) considered their first treatment was successful, 38% considered a subsequent treatment was successful, and 16% considered none of their treatments were successful. Participants undergoing PAD and AV access procedures most often felt confused or overwhelmed (25% and 24%, respectively, vs 0% for AAA and CEA; P < .01). Patients with PAD had adequate information least often (70% vs 85% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P = .01), had the lowest satisfaction with understanding of their diagnosis (65% vs 95% for AAA, 100% for AV access, and 95% for CEA; P < .01), and most often considered none of their treatments successful (35% vs 0% for AAA, 15% for AV access, and 15% for CEA; P = .02).

The primary maturation rate was 88.2% at a mean of 39 \u00b1 24.1 days after the operation. By multiple logistic regression analysis, minimum cephalic vein (CV) diameter >2 mm was an independent predictor of RCAVF maturation (odds ratio, 3.672; 95% confidence interval, 1.394-9.673; P = .008), which was more easily achieved in nondiabetic patients. During the mean follow-up of 47.2 \u00b1 23.1 months, primary patency of RCAVFs was 80.3% at 1 year and 76.5% at 2 years. A Cox proportional hazard model showed diabetes was the only independent risk factor of primary patency (hazard ratio, 2.008; 95% confidence interval, 1.022-3.945; P = .043). Nondiabetic patients with a CV diameter >2 mm had significantly higher primary maturation rate and higher primary patency than diabetic patients with a CV diameter \u22642 mm.\nThere were different risk factors affecting RCAVF primary maturation and primary patency.

    "abstract": "Successful arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation is often challenging in obese patients. Optimal initial intraoperative blood flow (IOBF) is essential for adequate AVF maturation. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of obesity on IOBF and radiocephalic AVF maturation.\nPatients with a newly created radiocephalic AVF were included (N = 252). Obesity was defined as a baseline body mass index (BMI) \u226525 kg/m(2), and primary maturation failure was defined as failure to use the AVF successfully by 3 months after its creation. IOBF was measured immediately after construction of the AVF with a VeriQ system (MediStim, Oslo, Norway).\nThe mean BMI was 24.1 \u00b1 3.9 kg/m(2), and the prevalence of obesity was 31.3%. Particularly, 8.3% (21 patients) had a BMI \u226530 kg/m(2). Primary maturation failure occurred in 100 patients (39.7%), and an IOBF <190 mL/min was closely associated with the risk of maturation failure (relative risk, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-6.11). Compared with nonobese patients, obese subjects had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, whereas diameters of vessels were similar. When the patients were further divided into three groups as BMI <25, 25 to 29.9, and \u226530 kg/m(2), patients in the higher BMI group showed significantly lower IOBF and higher maturation failure rate. According to multivariate analysis, the statistically significant variables that determined maturation failure were obesity, previous vascular disease, increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, and IOBF <190 mL/min.\nObese patients had a significantly lower IOBF, and both obesity and low IOBF contributed to the primary maturation failure of AVF. Obesity-associated inflammation and atherosclerosis might play roles in this association.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI), the most advanced form of peripheral arterial disease, is associated with strikingly high morbidity and mortality rates. Autogenous single-segment great saphenous vein (GSV) remains the optimal conduit for infrainguinal revascularization. Unfortunately, GSV is unavailable in up to 20% of patients. There is no consensus about the alternative graft that should be used for infragenicular bypass grafting when the GSV is unavailable. Currently, there are no outcome data for cold-stored venous allograft use in regard to recent safety and efficacy objective performance goals described by the Society for Vascular Surgery.\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 118 infragenicular revascularizations performed for CLI with cold-stored venous allografts obtained from varicose vein stripping surgery in a single institution from November 2002 to August 2013.\nMean age (\u00b1 standard deviation) was 75 \u00b1 12 years (male, 76%; diabetes, 73%; dialysis, 16%), and 38% (n = 45) had a history of failed ipsilateral revascularization. None had suitable autogenous conduit for even composite vein bypass. The distal anastomosis was performed to an infrapopliteal artery in 85 cases (72%). At 30 days, perioperative death rate was 6.8%, major adverse cardiovascular event rate was 7.6%, and major adverse limb event rate was 11.9%. Mean follow-up was 34 \u00b1 29 months (range, 1-113 months). At 1 year, freedom from major adverse limb event or perioperative death, limb salvage, survival, amputation-free survival, and secondary patency rates were, respectively, 64.9%, 82.5%, 85.4%, 73.3%, and 58.3%. Ejection fraction <45% and dialysis were the most significant factors predicting failure of revascularization.\nCold-stored venous allografts may be used for performing infragenicular revascularization for CLI with acceptable safety and efficacy results despite poor long-term patency. Their level of performance remains inferior to autologous vein sources but seems comparable to alternative allografts or prosthetic conduit. Their availability is a major advantage compared with other biologic alternative sources.",

    "abstract": "Infected abdominal aortic disease and graft infections pose a significant challenge for the vascular surgeon. Thorough radical d\u00e9bridement, either preceded by extra-anatomic bypass or followed by in situ aortic replacement, is the mainstay of treatment. The role of endovascular repair by stent grafts is being increasingly described but is limited to relatively less virulent mycotic aneurysms or as a \"bridging\" option in sick patients with florid sepsis that necessitates eventual delayed definitive surgical management. Autologous femoral vein has been an excellent conduit for aortic bifurcation reconstruction in this setting. Although various configurations of femoral vein conduit have been described for aortobi-iliac reconstruction, an in-depth knowledge of the venous anatomy, physiology, mechanisms of \"profundization,\" and techniques of harvest and graft preparation is essential for efficient conduct of the operation and its optimal outcomes. We review in detail these aspects of \"pantaloon\" femoral vein graft creation as a \"neoaorta\".",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the early and late 7-year experience with the Endurant bifurcated stent graft system (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nBetween November 14, 2007, and December 2013, 712 consecutive high-risk patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent elective or urgent placement of an Endurant bifurcated endograft in our institution. The included patients were consecutive (all comers) and treated independently from their morphologic eligibility for use of the Endurant device based on the instructions for use. The primary study outcome was freedom from all-cause reintervention.\nThe median follow-up was 19.2 months (interquartile range, 6.3-35.9 months). Overall, 517 patients (72.6%) were treated on the basis of instructions for use conditions. On the other hand, 195 patients (27.4%) had morphologic data not consistent with the recommendations for the use of the Endurant system. The 30-day mortality was 1.4% (10 of 712). Nine patients (1.2%) were lost to follow-up because of relocation abroad. The overall mortality rate was 14.74% (101 of 703). Overall survival rate was 92.3% at 1 year, 86.4% at 2 years, and 65% at 5 years. Overall freedom from reintervention rate was 93.3%, 86.4%, and 65% at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. Five patients (0.7%) underwent a surgical conversion and explantation of the Endurant device. The reasons were endograft infection (n = 1), endoleak type Ia (n = 1), endoleak type II (n = 1), endograft and limb thrombotic occlusion (n = 1), and endotension (n = 1). The overall iliac limb occlusion rate was 2.1% (15 of 712).\nThe performance of the Endurant stent graft during a period of 7 years under real-life conditions was good, with low incidence of reinterventions and endoleaks.",

    "abstract": "Patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissections who are managed medically are at risk of aortic aneurysmal degeneration over time. However, the effect of improvement in antihypertensive medications and stricter blood pressure control is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the rate of aneurysmal degeneration in a contemporary cohort of patients with medically treated type B dissection.\nIncluded were all patients with acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection who were initially managed medically between March 1999 and March 2011 and had follow-up axial imaging studies. Maximum aortic growth was calculated by comparing the initial imaging study to the most current scan or imaging obtained just before any aortic-related intervention. An increase of \u22655 mm was the threshold considered as aortic growth. Predictors of aortic aneurysmal degeneration were determined using Cox proportional hazards models.\nWe identified 200 patients (61% men) with medically managed acute type B dissections receiving multiple imaging studies. Patients were an average age of 63.4 years, and 75.5% had a history of hypertension. Mean follow-up was 5.3 years (range, 0.1-14.7 years). Mean time between the initial and final imaging studies was 3.2 years (range, 0.1-12.9 years). At 5 years, only 51% were free from aortic growth. Fifty-six patients (28%) required operative intervention (50 open, 6 endovascular repair) for aneurysmal degeneration, and the actuarial 5-year freedom from intervention was 76%. After excluding five patients (2.5%) with early rapid degeneration requiring intervention within the first 2 weeks, the mean rate of aortic growth was 12.3 mm/y for the total aortic diameter, 3.8 mm/y for the true lumen diameter, and 8.6 mm/y for the false lumen diameter. Only aortic diameter at index presentation >3.5 cm was a risk factor for future growth (odds ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-4.81; P < .01). Complete thrombosis of the false lumen was protective against growth (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.42; P < .01).\nAlthough medical management of uncomplicated acute, type B aortic dissections has been the standard of care, at 5 years, a significant number of patients will require operative intervention for aneurysmal degeneration. Further studies of early intervention (eg, thoracic endovascular aortic repair) for type B aortic dissection to prevent late aneurysm formation are needed.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is among the most common procedures performed in the United States. However, consensus is lacking regarding optimal preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and ultimately, the threshold for surgery. We sought to characterize national variation in preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and threshold for surgery for asymptomatic CEA.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database was used to identify all CEA procedures performed for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis between 2003 and 2014. VQI currently captures 100% of CEA procedures performed at >300 centers by >2000 physicians nationwide. Three analyses were performed to quantify the variation in (1) preoperative imaging, (2) carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and (3) threshold for surgery.\nOf 35,695 CEA procedures in 33,488 patients, the study cohort was limited to 19,610 CEA procedures (55%) performed for asymptomatic disease. The preoperative imaging modality used before CEA varied widely, with 57% of patients receiving a single preoperative imaging study (duplex ultrasound imaging, 46%; computed tomography angiography, 7.5%; magnetic resonance angiography, 2.0%; cerebral angiography, 1.3%) and 43% of patients receiving multiple preoperative imaging studies. Of the 16,452 asymptomatic patients (89%) who underwent preoperative duplex ultrasound imaging, there was significant variability between centers in the degree of stenosis (50%-69%, 70%-79%, 80%-99%) designated for a given peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, and internal carotid artery-to-common carotid artery ratio. Although 68% of CEA procedures in asymptomatic patients were performed for an 80% to 99% stenosis, 26% were performed for a 70% to 79% stenosis, and 4.1% were performed for a 50% to 69% stenosis. At the surgeon level, the range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is from 0% to 100%. Similarly, at the center level, institutions range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 0% to 100%.\nDespite CEA being an extremely common procedure, there is widespread variation in the three primary determinants-preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and threshold for surgery-of whether CEA is performed for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Standardizing the approach to care for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis will mitigate the significant downstream effects of this variation on health care costs.",

At the surgeon level, the range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is from 0% to 100%. Similarly, at the center level, institutions range in the percentage of CEA procedures performed for a <80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 0% to 100%.",

    "abstract": "Self-expanding covered stents for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease have undergone an evolution during the years. Early results of the latest generation, the heparin-bonded Viabahn (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) with a contoured proximal edge, were promising, with reported 1-year primary patency rates of 73% to 78% in long lesions. The aim of this study was to present the 3-year outcome of the heparin-bonded Viabahn for SFA occlusive disease.\nAll patients treated with a heparin-bonded Viabahn in three centers between April 2009 and December 2011 were included in the study and retrospectively analyzed. Clinical state in Rutherford category, ankle-brachial indexes, and duplex ultrasound scans were the features of follow-up at 6 weeks and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Primary end points of the study were the 3-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates.\nA total of 73 SFAs in 70 patients were treated with a heparin-bonded Viabahn and included in the study. Fifty-four patients were male (77%), and the mean age was 70.0 \u00b1 9.1 years. The mean lesion length was 17.4 \u00b1 7.0 cm, and 84% were classified TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II types C and D. The median follow-up was 25 months (range, 2-55 months). The 3-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were 59%, 71%, and 82%, respectively, with a 3-year freedom from amputation of 100%.\nThe use of a heparin-bonded Viabahn for SFA occlusive disease is related to patency rates within limits of surgical reconstruction. The procedure is related to low morbidity and amputation rates.",

    "abstract": "The Stenting with Angioplasty and Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial compared carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to carotid artery stenting (CAS) among high-risk patients using a model of risk that has not been validated by previous publications. The objective of our study was to determine the accuracy of this high-risk model and to determine the true risk factors that result in patients being at high risk for CEA.\nProspectively collected data for 3098 CEAs between 2003 and 2011 at 20 Vascular Surgery Group of New England (VSGNE) centers were used. SAPPHIRE general inclusion criteria and primary outcomes were assessed. Factors that were associated with the primary outcome by analysis of variance (P < .10) and not linearly dependent, as determined by a Pearson correlation analysis, were further assessed for an independent association by multivariate logistic regression. A risk index model was developed for these significant predictors to accurately define high-risk CEA.\nThe average patient age was 69.9 \u00b1 9.5 years, 60% were male, and 45.7% were asymptomatic. The 1-year composite outcome event rate, defined as postoperative myocardial infarction and stroke or death, was 14.2%. Multivariate analysis (P < .05) found the following independently significant risk factors: age in years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.1; P < .001), preadmission living in a nursing home (95% CI, 1.2-6.6; P = .020), congestive heart failure (95% CI, 1.4-2.8; P < .001), diabetes mellitus (DM; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3; P < .001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (95% CI, 1.2-1.5; P < .001), any previous cerebrovascular disease (95% CI, 1.1-1.9; P = .003), and contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis (95% CI, 1.0-1.2; P = .001). Three of the SAPPHIRE high-risk criteria-abnormal stress test, recurrent stenosis after CEA, and previous radiotherapy to the neck-were not independently associated with an adverse outcome. Independently significant risk factors not included in the SAPPHIRE criteria are inclusion of ages <80 years, preadmission living in a nursing home, DM, contralateral carotid stenosis, and any previous cerebrovascular accident. The risk index predictors are age in years (40-49: 0 points; 50-59: 2 points; 60-69: 4 points; 70-79: 6 points; 80-89: 8 points), living in a nursing home (4 points), any cardiovascular disease (2 points), congestive heart failure (5 points), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3 points), DM (2 points), degree of contralateral stenosis (<50%: 0 points; 50%-69%: 1 point; 70%-near occlusion: 2 points; occlusion: 3 points). High-risk CEA is defined as >13 points, representing adverse outcome rate of 22.5%.\nSAPPHIRE and other previously reported high-risk CAS inclusion criteria do not include all of the factors found to be independently associated with outcomes. Further studies are required to determine whether CAS is inferior to CEA in high-risk patients using a validated model of risk. In addition, this preoperative assessment includes novel criteria that can be used to stratify risks.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) variant genotypes in patients with significant carotid restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and who underwent a revision CEA.\nThis was a cross-sectional analysis of 97 patients enrolled between 2001 and 2013. Three groups were investigated: group A included patients with internal carotid artery restenosis, group B included patients without restenosis after CEA, and group C included patients with peripheral arterial disease but without any signs of a carotid stenosis. Venous blood samples were drawn for the genotyping for MBL2 by polymerase chain reaction and for the determination of the MBL serum concentration by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay.\nThe serum concentration of MBL was higher in patients with the normal genotype than in those with the genotype variants of MBL (95% confidence interval, 272.8-1008.7 \u03bcg/L; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference among groups A, B, or C with respect to the presence of a variant genotype. Similarly, there was no significant gender difference regarding the presence of a variant genotype (P = .325).\nThe presence of a variant genotype of the MBL2 gene (and the correspondingly lower serum concentration of this molecule) was not correlated with the development of carotid restenosis after CEA beyond a follow-up of 12 months.",

    "abstract": "After arterial injury, endothelial cell (EC) migration is essential for healing, but lipid oxidation products activate TRPC6 and TRPC5 ion channels, leading to increased intracellular calcium and inhibition of EC migration in vitro. The objective of this study was to further evaluate the role of TRPC channels in EC migration in vitro and to validate in vitro findings in an in vivo model.\nMouse aortic ECs were cultured, and the effect of lysophosphatidylcholine, the major lysophospholipid in oxidized low-density lipoprotein, on migration was assessed in a razor-scrape assay. EC healing after a carotid injury with electrocautery was evaluated in wild-type (WT), TRPC6(-/-), and TRPC5(-/-) mice receiving either a chow or high-cholesterol (HC) diet.\nLysophosphatidylcholine inhibited EC migration of WT ECs to 22% of baseline and of TRPC5(-/-) ECs to 53% of baseline but had minimal effect on TRPC6(-/-) EC migration. Hypercholesterolemia severely impaired EC healing in vivo, with 51.4% \u00b1 1.8% and 24.9% \u00b1 2.0% of the injury resurfaced with ECs at 5 days in chow-fed and HC-fed WT mice, respectively (P < .001).

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. Antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads may be effective in controlling infection after d\u00e9bridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. We sought to determine an effective antibiotic in PMMA beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection.\nPMMA beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. Antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. Beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method.\nDaptomycin alone was not active against K. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). Tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. Meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. The addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. The presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem.\nAntibiotic PMMA beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. The addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. Further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that an experimental model of abdominal aortic aneurysm in rabbits results in progressive enlargement when induced by a combination of periaortic elastase administration and aortic coarctation.\nMale New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: (A) stenosis (n = 12), (B) elastase (n = 12), (C) aneurysm (n = 15), and (D) control (n = 12). The stenosis group received an extrinsic coarctation below the right renal artery, the elastase group received a 10-minute administration of 60 \u03bcL elastase (1 U/\u03bcL) in a 1.5-cm aortic segment, the aneurysm group received stenosis and elastase, and a sham operation was performed in the control group. The aortic diameter was measured after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks, and animals were subsequently euthanized for histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies.\nAll animals in the aneurysm group developed aneurysm by 2 weeks after treatment, with average diameters of 5.21 \u00b1 0.74 mm by 2 weeks, 6.23 \u00b1 1.10 mm by 4 weeks, 7.87 \u00b1 0.50 mm by 8 weeks, and 9.40 \u00b1 0.36 mm by 16 weeks. Aortic diameter dilated progressively, and all aneurysms developed by 4 weeks in the stenosis group (4.17 \u00b1 0.22 mm). Only one aneurysm was seen in the elastase group by week 1 (3.60 \u00b1 0.64 mm), and no aneurysm formed in the control group by week 8 (2.47 \u00b1 0.38 mm). The aneurysm group exhibited less media thickness, elastin content, and endothelial recovery, but stronger expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 and rabbit macrophage compared with the control group.\nThis novel rabbit abdominal aortic aneurysm model with a gradually enlarging diameter is simply and reliably induced, appropriately mimicking human aortic aneurysm disease.",

    "abstract": "The rectus femoris (RF) muscle flap, which is widely used to cover groin infected vascular grafts, is usually harvested through distal tendon division and an extensive muscle elevation and transposition into the groin wound defect. A case of a vascular prosthetic graft infection in the groin was successfully controlled after coverage with an RF flap that was harvested based on proximal portion mobilization instead of the conventional distal one. This case suggests that the RF muscle flap based on proximal insertion mobilization is a feasible, effective, technically simpler, and less invasive alternative to cover infected vascular grafts in the groin.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we investigated a locally developed technique of bonding arterial grafts with three antimicrobials to protect against early (within 2\u00a0weeks) perioperative bacterial contamination encountered occasionally during aortic graft prosthetic reconstruction. Vascular graft infections are classified by their appearance time (early [<4\u00a0months] vs late [>4\u00a0months] after graft implantation), degree of incorporation into the surrounding vessel wall, connectivity to the postoperative wound, and extent of graft involvement. In the current phase of testing, we evaluated the ability of our novel triple antimicrobial-bonded graft to prevent infection in the first 8\u00a0weeks after implantation.\nIn nine Sinclair miniature pigs, we surgically implanted a 6-mm vascular Dacron patch graft in the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Five pigs received grafts chemically bonded with a 60-mg/mL solution of rifampin, minocycline, and chlorhexidine, and four pigs received unbonded grafts. Before implantation, the five bonded grafts and three of the unbonded grafts were immersed for 15\u00a0minutes in a 2-mL solution containing 1-2\u00a0\u00d7 10\nAt week 9, all of the grafts were explanted. All S aureus-inoculated bonded grafts (n\u00a0= 5) showed no bacterial growth. The unbonded, uninoculated graft (n\u00a0= 1) showed low-level bacterial growth (<1.2\u00a0\u00d7 10\nOur triple-bonded aortic graft prevented perioperative aortic graft infection for at least 8\u00a0weeks in a porcine model. The synergistic antimicrobial activity of this graft was sufficient to prevent and/or eradicate infection during that period. Further studies are needed to assess the graft's ability to combat early-onset vascular graft infection for up to 4\u00a0months.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between tibiopopliteal velocities and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) severity is not well understood. We sought to characterize tibiopopliteal velocities in severe PAD and non-PAD control patients.\nPatients with an arterial duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination with PAD evaluated during a 5-year period were retrospectively compared with non-PAD controls. Control DUS examinations were collected sequentially during a 6-month period, retrospectively. PAD patients included those with lifestyle-limiting intermittent claudication warranting revascularization and patients with critical limb ischemia, defined as ischemic rest pain, gangrene, or a nonhealing ischemic ulcer. For each, tibial and popliteal artery peak systolic velocity (PSV) was measured at the proximal, mid, and distal segment of each artery, and a mean PSV for each artery was calculated. Mean PSV, ankle-brachial indices, peak ankle velocity (PAV), average ankle velocity (AAV), mean tibial velocity (MTV), and ankle-profunda index (API) were compared between the two groups using independent t-tests. PAV is the maximum PSV of the distal peroneal, posterior tibial (PT), or anterior tibial (AT) artery; AAV is the average PSV of the distal peroneal, PT, and AT arteries; MTV is calculated by first averaging the proximal, mid, and distal PSV for each tibial artery and then averaging the three means together; API is the AAV divided by proximal PSV of the profunda.\nDUS was available in 103 patients with PAD (68 patients with critical limb ischemia and 35 patients with intermittent claudication) and 68 controls. Mean ankle-brachial index in the PAD group was 0.64 \u00b1 0.25 compared with 1.08 \u00b1 0.09 in controls (P = .006). Mean PSVs were significantly lower in PAD patients than in controls at the popliteal (64.6 \u00b1 42.2 vs 76.2 \u00b1 29.6; P = .037), peroneal (34.3 \u00b1 26.4 vs 53.8 \u00b1 23.3; P < .001), AT (43.7 \u00b1 31.4 vs 65.4 \u00b1 25.0; P < .001), and PT (43.4 \u00b1 42.3 vs 74.1 \u00b1 30.6; P < .001) and higher at the profunda (131.5 \u00b1 88.0 vs 96.2 \u00b1 44.8; P = .001). Tibial parameters including PAV (52.6 \u00b1 45.0 vs 86.9 \u00b1 35.7; P < .001), AAV (37.4 \u00b1 26.4 vs 64.5 \u00b1 21.7; P < .001), MTV (41.7 \u00b1 30.4 vs 65.4 \u00b1 21.7; P < .001), and API (0.43 \u00b1 0.45 vs 0.75 \u00b1 0.30; P < .001) were significantly lower in the PAD group than in controls. Nonoverlapping 95% confidence interval reference ranges were established for severe PAD and non-PAD controls.\nThis study aims to characterize lower extremity arterial PSVs and ankle parameters in severe PAD and non-PAD controls. These early criteria establish reference ranges to guide vascular laboratory interpretation and clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate curvature and its effect on the durability of visceral and renal branches in patients undergoing endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) with fenestrated/branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/B-EVAR).\nQuantitative branch vessel curvature assessment on branches arising from reinforced fenestrations was performed for 168 patients undergoing F/B-EVAR for type II and type III TAAAs. Preoperative and postoperative centerline coordinates were obtained using iNtuition (TeraRecon, Foster City, Calif) and exported into MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Mass) based on thin-slice computed tomography imaging. Spline interpolation was applied to the centerline coordinates and resampled at 100 equally spaced points, and curvature calculations (\u03ba, mm(-1)) were applied. Global and maximal curvatures for each of the target vessels were measured and categorized by severity. Categories for curvature were 0 to 0.05 mm(-1) (low), 0.05 to 0.1 mm(-1) (medium), 0.1 to 0.15 mm(-1) (high), and >0.15 mm(-1) (extreme) for global curvature and 0 to 0.2 mm(-1), 0.2 to 0.4 mm(-1), 0.4 to 0.6 mm(-1), and >0.6 mm(-1), respectively, for maximum curvature. Curvature variances were assessed for an association with vessel patency and need for reintervention.\nThere were 558 vessels that underwent analysis based on repairs involving 650 vessels, whereby 92 vessels were excluded as they were treated with an external helical branch (58 celiac arteries and 34 superior mesenteric arteries). There was a significant difference found before and after F/B-EVAR for the global celiac artery curvature (median difference, -0.01; P < .001), global left renal artery curvature (median, -0.01; P = .014), maximum left renal artery curvature (median, 0.05; P < .001), and maximum right renal artery curvature (median, 0.03; P = .009). Maximum artery curvature was found to have shifted distally in all vessels postoperatively; 37 adverse events (AEs) were observed in 30 patients (6 branched occlusions and 31 reinterventions [24 type III endoleaks, 5 vessel stenoses, and 2 vessel occlusions]). The majority of AEs (>70%) occurred within the range of low to medium curvature. Univariate analysis found gender to be a dependent variable associated with high (maximum) preoperative curvature (odds ratio, 0.395; P = .02). The use of self-expanding stents (vs balloon-expandable stents alone) in vessels with high preoperative curvature (>0.6 mm(-1)) was significant in the right renal artery (P = .044).\nThis study did not show a significant relationship between the severity of artery curvature or changes in curvature and AEs found for visceral or renal branches after F/B-EVAR for extensive TAAA. Surprisingly, the majority of AEs occurred in low- and medium-curved vessels. This study is limited in that it does not take into account other factors that may affect AEs, like motion, which would be valuable in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Risk of open conversion after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR-c) is poorly defined. The purpose of this analysis was to determine outcomes of elective EVAR-c compared with elective primary open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (PAR) in the Vascular Quality Initiative.\nVascular Quality Initiative patients who underwent elective EVAR-c and PAR (2002-2014) were reviewed. Candidate predictors of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) and/or 30-day mortality were entered into a multivariable model, and stepwise elimination was used to reduce the number of covariates to a best subset of predictors. To estimate the additive risk of EVAR-c for MACE or 30-day mortality over PAR, this variable was added along with the best subset of predictors into generalized estimating equations logistic regression models.\nWe identified 159 EVAR-c and 3741 PAR patients. EVAR-c patients were older (73.5\u00a0\u00b1 8.1 vs 69.5\u00a0\u00b1 8.4\u00a0years; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), more likely to have diabetes (21% vs 15%; P\u00a0= .03), and history of lower extremity bypass (9% vs 4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0006). EVAR-c was associated with a higher incidence of retroperitoneal aortic exposure (41%; n\u00a0= 64 vs PAR, 26%, n\u00a0= 976; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), use of a bifurcated graft (65%; n\u00a0= 101 vs PAR, 52%; n\u00a0= 1923; P\u00a0= .001), greater blood loss (median [interquartile range], 2000\u00a0mL [1010-3500] vs PAR, 1200\u00a0mL [750-2000]; P\u00a0< .0001) and longer procedure times (EVAR-c, 275\u00a0\u00b1 122\u00a0minutes vs PAR, 232\u00a0\u00b1 9\u00a0minutes; P\u00a0< .0001). However, PAR more frequently was completed with a suprarenal and/or mesenteric cross-clamp (74%, n\u00a0= 2749 vs EVAR-c, 53%, n\u00a0= 83; P\u00a0< .0001) and had a higher incidence of concomitant procedures (26%; n\u00a0= 972 vs EVAR-c, 18%; n\u00a0= 28; P\u00a0= .03). Nonadjusted 30-day mortality was greater after EVAR-c: EVAR-c, 8% (n\u00a0= 10) vs PAR, 3% (n\u00a0= 105); P\u00a0= .009. There was no difference in complication rates: EVAR-c, 33% (n\u00a0= 52) vs PAR, 28% (n\u00a0= 1056); P\u00a0=.3. Preoperative 30-day mortality predictors included age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06/y, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.1; P\u00a0< .0001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.5; P\u00a0< .0001), history of leg bypass (OR, 2.3, 1.2-4.4;P\u00a0=.01), suprarenal cross-clamp (OR 2.2, 1.2-4.1;P\u00a0=.01), prior carotid revascularization (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.8; P\u00a0= .0004), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.9-3.5; P\u00a0= .08), and female sex (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3; P\u00a0= .02; area under the curve, 0.75). When controlling for covariates, EVAR-c was not significantly associated with MACE (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7-2.0; P\u00a0= .4) or 30-day mortality (OR, 2.0; 0.9-4.2; P\u00a0= .08).\nEVAR-c patients are typically older, have more comorbidities, and experience greater blood loss and longer procedure times compared with PAR patients. However, postoperative morbidity and mortality are primarily driven by\u00a0patient covariates and intraoperative factors, rather than the need for endograft explantation. Several preoperative variables were identified as predictors of 30-day mortality after elective EVAR-c and should be considered during the decision-making process for remedial treatment of failed endovascular PAR.",

    "abstract": "\"Never events\" refers to harmful hospital-acquired conditions that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services identified in 2008 as largely preventable and that would no longer be reimbursed. Our goal was to identify the incidence, predictive factors, temporal trend, and associated consequences of never events after major open vascular surgery procedures.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) (2003-2011) was queried to identify never events applicable to vascular surgery patients, including air embolism, catheter-based urinary tract infections (UTIs), stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcers, falls/trauma, blood incompatibility, vascular catheter infections, complications of poor glucose control, retained foreign objects, and wrong-site surgery. We specifically evaluated open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, and lower extremity bypass/femoral endarterectomy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict never events based on preoperative variables. Multivariable logistic and gamma regression models were used to study mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and charges.\nNever events were identified in 774 of 267,734 patients. The distribution of never events were falls/trauma (59%), pressure ulcers (19%), catheter-based UTI (9%), vascular catheter infection (6%), complications of poor glucose control (5%), and retained objects (4%). Rates of falls and catheter-based UTIs have increased since 2008. Multivariable predictors of any never event included lower extremity bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm, weight loss, nonelective admission, paralysis, repair, congestive heart failure, altered mental status, renal failure, weekend admission, diabetes, female gender, and age. Race, insurance, hospital type, income level, geography, July to September admission, and other comorbidities were not predictive. After risk factor adjustment, never events were associated with increased perioperative mortality (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-34.8; P\u00a0< .001), LOS (means ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.7-2.0; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and total charges (means ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.8; P\u00a0< .001).\nNever events after major vascular surgery are associated with a number of perioperative factors and are predictive of increased charges, LOS, and mortality. Falls and catheter-based UTIs have increased in frequency since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that it would no longer reimburse for these complications. This study establishes baseline never event rates in the vascular surgery patient population and identifies high-risk patients to target for quality improvement.",

Patients were identified from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's Discharge Abstract Database, which includes all hospital admissions across Canada, with the exception of the Province of Quebec.\nDuring the study period, 3823 patients underwent lower limb amputations (major amputations = 95%) and 2116 were readmitted at least once (55.4%). Of those patients, 1112 (29.1%) were readmitted within 30 days (mean = 5.0 \u00b1 8.3 days after discharge) and 1004 (26.3%) were readmitted between 31 and 365 days (mean = 151.4 \u00b1 95.9 days after discharge). Stump complications accounted for 13% and 10% of early and late readmissions, respectively. Stump revision surgery was performed in 301 readmitted patients (7.9%). Predictors of early readmission included amputation by a vascular surgeon (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.9), female sex (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.5), and a short (<7 day) admission (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.1).

    "abstract": "Potential cost effectiveness of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared with open aortic repair (OAR) is offset by the use of intraoperative adjuncts (components) or late reinterventions. Anatomic severity grade (ASG) can be used preoperatively to assess abdominal aortic aneurysms, and provide a quantitative measure of anatomic complexity. The hypothesis of this study is that ASG is directly related to the use of intraoperative adjuncts and cost of aortic repair.\nPatients who undergo elective OAR and EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysms were identified over a consecutive 3-year period. ASG scores were calculated manually using three-dimensional reconstruction software by two blinded reviewers. Statistical analysis of cost data was performed using a log transformation. Regression analyses, with a continuous or dichotomous outcome, used a generalized estimating equations approach with the sandwich estimator, being robust with respect to deviations from model assumptions.\nOne hundred forty patients were identified for analysis, n = 33 OAR and n = 107 EVAR. The mean total cost (\u00b1 standard deviation) for OAR was per thousand (k) $38.3 \u00b1 49.3, length of stay (LOS) 13.5 \u00b1 14.2 days, ASG score 18.13 \u00b1 3.78; for EVAR, mean total cost was k $24.7 \u00b1 13.0 (P = .016), LOS 3.0 \u00b1 4.4 days (P = .012), ASG score 15.9 \u00b1 4.13 (P = .010). In patients who underwent EVAR, 25.2% required intraoperative adjuncts, and analysis of this group revealed a mean total cost of k $31.5 \u00b1 15.9, ASG score 18.48 \u00b1 3.72, and LOS 3.9 \u00b1 4.5, which were significantly greater compared with cases without adjunctive procedures. An ASG score of \u226515 correlated with an increased propensity for requirement of intraoperative adjuncts; odds ratio, 5.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.82-18.19). ASG >15 was also associated with chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease, hypertension, female sex, increased cost, and use of adjunctive procedures.\nComplex aneurysm anatomy correlates with increased total cost and need for adjunctive procedures during EVAR. Preoperative assessment with ASG scores can delineate patients at greater risk for increased resource use. Patient comorbid factors are associated with anatomic complexity defined according to ASG. A critical examination of the relationship between anatomic complexity and finances is required within the context of aggressive endovascular treatment strategies and shifts toward value-based reimbursement.",

    "abstract": "Persistent type II endoleaks (T2Ls) with sac enlargement after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair are still of concern in view of the potential for rupture. Current treatments (embolization and stent graft [SG] explantation) are associated with lack of efficacy or high perioperative morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated an alternative technique that combines sacotomy, ligation of patent back-bleeding vessels, and SG preservation for T2L or unspecified endoleak repair.\nThis multicenter study in France included 28 patients (27 men; median age, 78\u00a0years). Twenty-one patients (75%) had a bifurcated SG (including 3 fenestrated SGs) and seven (25%) had an aortouni-iliac SG (2 for ruptured aneurysm). Unsuccessful embolization had been performed in 10 patients (36%). Four patients (14%) presented sac enlargement with no endoleak visible on computed tomography. The origin of the endoleak remained unspecified in three patients 3 (11%). The median diameter of the aneurysmal sac was 78\u00a0mm (vs 55\u00a0mm at the time of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair) after a median follow-up of 24\u00a0months.\nA transperitoneal approach was used in 21 patients (75%) and a retroperitoneal approach was used in seven (25%). A guidewire was placed in the supraceliac aorta in 14 patients, and an occlusion balloon was temporarily inflated in six. Aortic cross-clamping was performed in five patients. T2Ls were identified in 26 patients, and associated with a distal type I endoleak in 1 patient, a type III endoleak in 3, and a type IV endoleak in 1. Two patients presented with endotension. All the endoleaks were treated successfully, with a mean operating time of 120\u00a0minutes and a mean blood loss of 450\u00a0mL. One SG was explanted 12\u00a0days after the procedure because of early infection. One patient died during SG explantation for an aortoduodenal fistula 26\u00a0months after the endoaneurysmorrhaphy. During a median follow-up of 24\u00a0months, the control computed tomography scan showed shrinkage of the aneurysmal sac with stable diameters in all patients. No missed T2Ls, no recurrence of T2L, and no SG migration or disjunction was observed.\nObliterating endoaneurysmorrhaphy with SG preservation can be considered as an alternative to SG removal in cases of persistent T2L responsible for aneurysmal sac enlargement after embolization failure. By avoiding extensive dissection for surgical aortic cross-clamping, minimizing hemodynamic changes, and reducing blood loss and operating time, this procedure can be performed even in patients initially considered unfit for surgery.",

Herein, we seek factors that affect the CAS-CEA treatment differences and potentially to identify a subgroup of patients for whom CAS and CEA have equivalent periprocedural S+D risk.\nPatient and arterial characteristics were assessed as effect modifiers of the CAS-CEA treatment difference in 2502 patients by the addition of factor-by-treatment interaction terms to a logistic regression model.\nLesion length and lesions that were contiguous or were sequential and noncontiguous extending remote from the bulb were identified as influencing the CAS-to-CEA S+D treatment difference. For those with longer lesion length (\u226512.85\u00a0mm), the risk of CAS was higher than that of CEA (odds ratio [OR], 3.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-9.78). Among patients with sequential or remote lesions extending beyond the bulb, the risk for S+D was higher for CAS relative to CEA (OR, 9.01; 95% CI, 1.20-67.8). For the 37% of patients with lesions that were both short and contiguous, the odds of S+D in those treated with CAS was nonsignificantly 28% lower than for CEA (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.21-2.46).\nThe higher S+D risk for those treated with CAS appears to be largely isolated to those with longer lesion length and/or those with sequential and remote lesions. In the absence of those lesion characteristics, CAS appears to be as safe as CEA with regard to periprocedural risk of S+D.",

We examined the safety and efficacy of AR during pancreatectomy.\nWe used a prospective institutional database that includes 6522 patients who underwent pancreatectomy from 1970 to 2014; 35 had AR. We performed a 2:1 propensity match for patients without and with AR on the basis of preoperative patient and tumor variables. We then compared operative and postoperative outcomes between matched groups.\nAR included 18 hepatic, 8 celiac, 3 splenic, 3 middle colic, 2 superior mesenteric, and 1 left renal artery. There were 20 primary, 4 vein, and 2 graft reconstructions; 11 were emergent and 24 elective. Before matching, patients with AR were younger (58 \u00b1 2 vs 63 \u00b1 0.2 years old; P = .05), more likely to be of black race (26% vs 9%; P = .003), to have received preoperative chemotherapy (17% vs 2%; P < .001), have a later stage and larger tumor (4 \u00b1 0.8 vs 3 \u00b1 0.04 cm; P = .05), more resections that included removal of all macroscopic disease, but microscopic residual tumor remained (31% vs 14%; P = .02), greater blood loss (1285 \u00b1 276 vs 822 \u00b1 16 mL; P = .02), and more frequent cardiac complications (11% vs 4%; P = .03) compared with patients without AR. After propensity matching, baseline patient characteristics were similar between groups. For perioperative outcomes, the groups did not differ in surgical time, blood loss, length of stay, or complications including anastomotic leaks, bleeding, cardiac, infectious complications, or liver infarct or failure (all; P = not significant). Patency was 97% at a mean follow-up of 510 \u00b1 184 days with 1 hepatic artery AR thrombosis. Long-term outcomes were significantly different: patients with AR had a lower rate of local tumor recurrence (20% vs 47%; P = .007) but also lower 1-year (50% vs 87%; P = .002) and median survival (22 \u00b1 18 vs 49 \u00b1 7 months; P = .002).\nAR during pancreatectomy is safe and not associated with increased complications. Although it significantly reduces the risk of local tumor recurrence, AR is associated with worse survival compared with patients who do not undergo AR.",

    "abstract": "This study examined effects and functional outcome of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) and carbamylated erythropoietin fusion protein (cEPO-FC) preconditioning in a rabbit model for spinal cord ischemia and resulting paraplegia. This model was chosen because only a small surgical effect is needed to cause paraplegia in rabbits, which facilitates postoperative observation of animals.\nAnesthetized but spontaneously breathing New Zealand White rabbits randomly received cEPO-FC (50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg; n\u00a0= 8), rhEPO (5000 IU/kg; n\u00a0= 10), or vehicle (control; n\u00a0= 10) 30\u00a0minutes before and after infrarenal aortic clamping. Ideal clamping time of 22\u00a0minutes was identified from preceding clamping tests (15-25\u00a0minutes). Postoperative observation time was 96\u00a0hours. Spinal cord function was assessed by neurologic evaluation of hind limb motor function every 12\u00a0hours using a modified Tarlov score. Spinal cord tissue damage was evaluated after 96\u00a0hours using hematoxylin and eosin, elastica van Gieson, Nissl, Masson-Goldner, and hemosiderin staining. Plasma levels of cell senescence markers stathmin, chitinase 1/3, elongation factor 1-\u03b1 were determined.\nRabbits that received rhEPO showed significant improvement of spontaneous lower limb movements until 36\u00a0hours of reperfusion and improved histologic scores upon examination of the lumbar spinal cord compared with the control group. In contrast, cEPO-FC treatment showed comparable outcome to the control group concerning movements of the lower limbs and histology. Senescence markers were elevated in the control group, but not in the treatment groups, except for chitinase 3 in the rhEPO group. Only stathmin showed no significant effect. Markers for senescence might increase after acute ischemic injury. Attenuation of senescence markers might not come alone from improvement of the spinal cord.\nPreconditioning with rhEPO attenuates ischemia/reperfusion injury of the spinal cord, whereas the carbamylated derivative (cEPO-FC) showed no positive effect on spinal cord function.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing application of fenestrated and physician-modified endografting for aneurysm repair, there is increasing concern about the accuracy of vessel position measurements based on computed tomography scans. Inaccuracies in measurements may result in a \"window-shutter\" or \"eclipsing\" phenomenon whereby the fenestration may not overlie the vessel ostium completely. We hypothesized that vessel position measurements from reconstructed imaging do not represent the true vessel position as obtained from a three-dimensional (3D) printed physical model of the visceral aortic segment.\nMedical 3D modeling software was used to develop the 3D reconstructions, which were then exported to the 3D printing software. This allowed 3D models to be physically generated. The distances to the top and bottom and the angle of each of the celiac, superior mesenteric, right renal, and left renal arteries were recorded. These same measurements were obtained by each of the blinded reviewers in addition to the aortic diameter at the midpoint of each of these vessels. Measurements were compared with intraclass correlation coefficient, nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test, and one-sample t-test to assess accuracy and precision. Statistical significance was set at P\u00a0< .05 for all tests.\nBoth the individual measurements and the average of the measurements were statistically accurate (significant) for the bottom of the superior mesenteric artery and the top and bottom of both the right and left renal arteries. There was variability and inaccuracy in all visceral vessel angles and in the bottom of the celiac artery (the top and the angle of the celiac artery were the arbitrary referents).\nWhereas the visceral vessel orifices are largely accurately assessed and measured, the vessel angles are not. This may lead to an eclipsing phenomenon, which may contribute to branch or fenestrated vessel failure and therefore reintervention. Further efforts should assess the clinical significance of the eclipsing phenomenon and should target accurate and appropriate fenestration construction to prevent long-term morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Providing patients and payers with publicly reported risk-adjusted quality metrics for the purpose of benchmarking physicians and institutions has become a national priority. Several prediction models have been developed to estimate outcomes after lower extremity revascularization for critical limb ischemia, but the optimal model to use in contemporary practice has not been defined. We sought to identify the highest-performing risk-adjustment model for amputation-free survival (AFS) at 1\u00a0year after lower extremity bypass (LEB).\nWe used the national Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database (2003-2012) to assess the performance of three previously validated risk-adjustment models for AFS. The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL), Finland National Vascular (FINNVASC) registry, and the modified Project of Ex-vivo vein graft Engineering via Transfection III (PREVENT III [mPIII]) risk scores were applied to the VQI cohort. A novel model for 1-year AFS was also derived using the VQI data set and externally validated using the PIII data set. The relative discrimination (Harrell c-index) and calibration (Hosmer-May goodness-of-fit test) of each model were compared.\nAmong 7754 patients in the VQI who underwent LEB for critical limb ischemia, the AFS was 74% at 1\u00a0year. Each of the previously published models for AFS demonstrated similar discriminative performance: c-indices for BASIL, FINNVASC, mPIII were 0.66, 0.60, and 0.64, respectively. The novel VQI-derived model had improved discriminative ability with a c-index of 0.71 and appropriate generalizability on external validation with a c-index of 0.68. The model was well calibrated in both the VQI and PIII data sets (goodness of fit P\u00a0= not significant).\nCurrently available prediction models for AFS after LEB perform modestly when applied to national contemporary VQI data. Moreover, the performance of each model was inferior to that of the novel VQI-derived model. Because the importance of risk-adjusted outcome reporting continues to increase, national registries such as VQI should begin using this novel model for benchmarking quality of care.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the outcome of the contralateral internal iliac artery (IIA) in patients undergoing aortouni-iliac (AUI) endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) with a femorofemoral bypass.\nThis retrospective study evaluated 131 consecutive patients undergoing AUI EVAR with femorofemoral bypass at the McGill University Health Center from October 2001 to November 2010. One hundred patients with preoperatively patent contralateral IIA met inclusion criteria for the study. Preoperative demographics and preoperative and postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans with multiplanar reconstruction were reviewed for all patients. The last available postoperative CT imaging for all patients was identified and evaluated for contralateral IIA patency. Patency in preoperative and postoperative CT scans was defined as contrast enhancement of the IIA in continuity with the external iliac artery and absence of >50% stenosis at the origin of the IIA. Clinical outcome focused on postoperative pelvic ischemia and reported symptoms of buttock claudication.\nMean age at the time of operation was 77.6\u00a0\u00b1 6.7\u00a0years, and 78% were male. Mean clinical follow-up was 29.2\u00a0months after surgery, and mean follow-up of imaging with intravenous contrast was 30.6\u00a0months. The last imaging follow-up showed 67 patients (67%) had a patent contralateral IIA and that the IIAs in 33 patients (33%) were occluded (25 [76%]) or stenotic (8 [24%]). Of the patients with IIA occlusion, 80% (20 of 25) were occluded on the first postoperative imaging (median, 8.5\u00a0days). Buttock claudication was reported in 18% (6 of 33 patients) with an occluded IIA compared with only 3% (2 of 67 patients) of patients with a patent contralateral IIA on final imaging follow-up (18% vs 3%; P\u00a0= .014). There were no observed cases of buttock necrosis, spinal ischemia, or colonic ischemia.\nOur findings suggest that AUI EVAR with femorofemoral bypass is associated with a significant incidence of contralateral IIA malperfusion on postoperative CT imaging. Occlusion appears to occur early in the postoperative period in most patients, and patient-reported buttock claudication is observed significantly more frequently in patients with an occluded IIA compared with those with a patent IIA. More serious pelvic ischemic complications were not seen in this series. Further study is required to determine whether modification of the procedure can prevent contralateral IIA occlusion and the development of buttock claudication.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between attainment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and clinical outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has received little attention. We sought to investigate clinical outcomes in relation to attainment of LDL-C goals in patients with PAD after endovascular treatment.\nWe reviewed 342 PAD patients treated with endovascular therapy from 2010 through 2012. We categorized patients into two groups based on the attained LDL-C levels at short-term follow-up (mean, 4.8 \u00b1 2.8 months): group A (n = 160), with LDL-C <70 mg/dL; and group B (n = 182), with LDL-C \u226570 mg/dL. The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke.\nBaseline characteristics were similar between group A and group B except for obstructive pulmonary disease (0% vs 7%; P = .001). More patients in group A received statin therapy than those in group B (93% vs 76%; P < .001). MACEs (4% vs 10%; P = .002) and all-cause mortality (2% vs 7%; P = .007) occurred less frequently in group A than in group B at 2 years. A Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression model identified attainment of LDL-C goal <70 mg/dL at short-term follow-up as an independent predictor of reduced MACEs (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.67; P = .006) along with age as a predictor of increased MACEs (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.08; P = .031).\nAttainment of LDL-C goal <70 mg/dL at short-term follow-up is an independent predictor of reduced mortality and cardiovascular events after endovascular therapy in patients with PAD.",

However, their microbial contamination is highly problematic and often results in devastating clinical complications. To reduce the risk of infection, Dacron grafts may be coated with rifampicin.

    "abstract": "Discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications before surgery has been suggested because of the potentially deleterious effects of hypotension. We investigated the effect of preoperative ACEI and/or ARB use on early outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nWe examined 3752 consecutive CEA patients within the Vascular Study Group of New England from September 2012 to September 2014 and compared outcomes for patients treated (n = 1772) or not treated (n = 1980) with ACEI and/or ARB preoperatively. Outcomes included perioperative need for intravenous vasoactive medication (IVBPmed) for hypotension or hypertension (HTN), major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), and the combined outcome of stroke or death. Adjusted analysis was performed using multivariable logistic regression of the crude cohort and by constructing a propensity score matched cohort (n = 1441).\nACEI and/or ARB users were more likely to be male (64% vs 59%; P = .001), with a higher prevalence of diabetes (41% vs 28%; P < .0001), HTN (97% vs 82%; P < .0001), coronary artery disease (31% vs 25%; P = .0001), congestive heart failure (10% vs 8%; P = .02), and asymptomatic carotid disease (59% vs 54%; P = .004). Patients who received ACEI and/or ARB preoperatively were more likely to be treated with aspirin (92% vs 88%; P = .0002) and statins (89% vs 85%; P = .001) preoperatively. In the unadjusted analysis, no significant differences were identified in hypotension that required IVBPmed (12% vs 11%; odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.4; P = .22), MACE (3% vs 2%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-1.9; P = .32), or stroke or death (3% vs 3%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.6; P = .89) for preoperative ACEI and/or ARB treated and nontreated patients, respectively. Preoperative ACEI and/or ARB usage was, however, associated with HTN that required IVBPmed (13% vs 10%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6; P = .01). Analysis of the propensity score matched cohort revealed no significant differences in hypotension that required IVBPmed (12% vs 12%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3; P = .86), MACE (3% vs 2%; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.8; P = .62; ), or stroke or death (3% vs 3%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.6; P = .91) for patients treated or not treated with preoperative ACEI and/or ARB, respectively. ACEI and/or ARB remained associated with HTN that required IVBPmed (13% vs 10%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P = .02). Results were similar after adjustment using logistic regression. The incidence of hospital length of stay >1 day was similar between ACEI and/or ARB treated and not treated patients (29% vs 32%; OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-1.1; P = .21).\nPreoperative ACEI and/or ARB use was associated with marginally increased use of IVBPmed for HTN but not for hypotension and was not associated with increased MACE, stroke, or death. On the basis of these metrics, the use of preoperative ACEI and/or ARB appears safe before CEA.",

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is one of the most common vascular emergencies, with high risk for limb loss if it is not treated expediently. Endovascular therapy is less invasive and used increasingly because of patient factors that disfavor open surgery despite limited quality data to support its safety and efficacy. This evidence summary reviews literature from 1990 to 2014, comparing contemporary surgical and endovascular revascularization. Systematic review was performed with emphasis on acuity of presentation, study design, revascularization techniques, limb salvage and mortality rates, and complications. There were 2999 articles identified and 563 abstracts reviewed; 68 articles were reviewed fully and 26 critically appraised. Limb salvage, amputation-free survival, overall survival and mortality, and treatment complications were elucidated, including Medicare outcomes data. Risk factors for amputation and mortality were identified. Surgical or endovascular revascularization for ALI is achievable with acceptable limb salvage and amputation rates, which are not markedly different between the two modalities in the short term. Endovascular therapy and surgery are complementary rather than competing strategies for ALI. Further good-quality clinical trial data are needed to define longer term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Repeated percutaneous interventions on failing arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) for hemodialysis are common, but the outcomes are largely unknown. We sought to determine the results of the second percutaneous intervention on failing AVGs and AVFs and to identify factors associated with loss of patency.\nFor the purpose of this study, the second percutaneous intervention was identified as the index procedure. We reviewed the second percutaneous interventions on failing AVFs and AVGs at a single institution between 2007 and 2013. Patient comorbidities, graft or fistula configuration, lesion characteristics, and procedural characteristics of the intervention performed were analyzed with respect to technical success, primary patency, primary assisted patency, and secondary patency. Patency was defined per Society for Vascular Surgery recommended reporting standards and was determined from the time of the index procedure. Cox proportional hazards multivariable modeling was performed to identify independent determinants of loss of patency.\nAmong 91 patients, 96 second-time percutaneous interventions were performed on 52 AVFs and 44 AVGs. Patients included 56% men and 44% women with a mean age of 64 \u00b1 17 years. The lesions intervened on were primarily located along the accessed portion of the outflow in AVFs and within the length of the graft and at the venous anastomosis in AVGs. Transluminal angioplasty alone was performed in 82 procedures (85%), and uncovered or covered stents were placed in 15 procedures (16%). Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy was performed in 32 patients (34%) and was more commonly performed in AVGs compared with AVFs (53% vs 17%; P = .0002). Technical success was achieved in 90 procedures (97%; n = 92). One-year primary patency, assisted primary patency, and secondary patency rates were 35%, 86%, and 86%, respectively. One-year primary patency did not differ between AVFs and AVGs, but secondary patency was lower for AVG in comparison to AVF (P = .04). On multivariable analysis, only the need for pharmacomechanical thrombectomy significantly predicted failure of primary patency (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-4.3). The presence of an AVG rather than an AVF independently predicted failure of secondary patency (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-8.2).\nThe second percutaneous interventions on AVFs and AVGs are associated with excellent technical success but poor primary patency. The need for pharmacomechanical thrombectomy predicts the need for additional percutaneous intervention to maintain patency. With additional interventions, acceptable secondary patency out to 5 years can be achieved, although AVGs have inferior secondary patency to AVFs. To develop optimal practice management algorithms, the effectiveness of repeated percutaneous interventions for failing AVGs and AVFs vs creation of a new access should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the status of isolated superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection in the most populous country, China.\nThe Chinese-language literature published before December 2014 was reviewed. All case reports and series were included. If multiple reports originated from the same hospital and included overlapping time frames, only the most recent report was included. The clinical characteristics, imaging features, and treatment were analyzed. \"Symptom relief\" was used as the outcome measure.\nA total of 622 patients (88.5% male) with isolated SMA dissection were found in the Chinese-language literature. Patients were a mean age of 55.4 years. Analysis of the demographic data showed that isolated SMA dissection was most reported from the developed areas of China. The most common symptom (91.1%) was abdominal pain, and 42.7% patients had hypertension as a complication. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used to diagnose 95.2% of patients. The mean distance from the SMA ostium to the beginning of the dissection was 20.1 mm (range, 0-65.0 mm). The mean length of dissection was 63.1 mm (range, 10.7-205.9 mm). The percentages of patients who underwent primary conservative, surgical, and endovascular treatments were 63.2%, 3.2% and 33.6%, respectively. As primary management, the symptom relief rate of conservative management, with or without anticoagulation, was 62.6% and 86.5%, respectively. The best result of conservative treatment was achieved in cases of Yun type I and Luan classification type B. The symptom relief rate of surgical and endovascular treatment was 100% and 95.2%, respectively.\nThe incidence of isolated SMA dissection may not be as rare as previously reported. Endovascular treatment of isolated SMA dissection is commonly used in China as a first-line treatment.",

We sought to describe VTE outcomes of our 15-year IVC reconstruction experience.\nWe performed a retrospective institutional review of all patients who underwent IVC reconstruction (September 1999-October 2014) and describe perioperative VTE outcomes.\nSixty-five patients (mean age 58\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00a0years) underwent IVC reconstruction (primary repair, 25%; patch, 43%; graft, 32%), most commonly for renal cell carcinoma (51%) and retroperitoneal sarcoma (22%). The overall incidence of perioperative VTE was 22% (n\u00a0= 14), including isolated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 9% (n\u00a0= 6) and pulmonary embolism in 12% (n\u00a0= 8; 4 with concomitant DVT). Median time to diagnosis was 6\u00a0days (range, 1-37\u00a0days). Most VTE patients were symptomatic (57%; 8 of 14), including lower extremity edema in 50%, acute desaturation in 43%, and hemodynamic compromise in 36%. No patient died as a result of his or her VTE. There was a trend for more overall VTE events in patients who underwent graft reconstruction (primary, 13%; patch, 18%; graft, 33%; P\u00a0= .06). VTE was also significantly associated with larger tumor size, renal vein reimplantation, and blood transfusions (P \u2264 .05). Late complications of VTE included lower extremity edema in two patients and graft thrombosis in one patient.\nIVC reconstruction can be performed safely with low VTE-associated morbidity. Routine anticoagulation might not be warranted in these patients, but early postoperative screening for DVT should be considered, especially in cases with large tumor burden or when graft reconstruction is performed.",

    "abstract": "Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have angiogenic potential owing to their differentiation into endothelial cells and their release of angiogenic growth factors to elicit paracrine effects. In addition, control-released basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) sustained with a gelatin hydrogel also supports effective angiogenesis. We sought to determine if coadministration of ASCs and control-released bFGF into murine ischemic limbs facilitates angiogenesis.\nLevels of growth factors in the conditioned media of ASCs cultured with or without control-released bFGF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A murine ischemic hind limb model was generated and intramuscularly injected with the following: gelatin hydrogel (group 1), a high number of ASCs (group 2), control-released bFGF (group 3), a small number of ASCs and control-released bFGF (group 4), and a high number of ASCs and control-released bFGF (group 5). Macroscopic and microscopic vascular changes were evaluated until day 7 by laser Doppler perfusion imaging and histologic analyses, respectively.\nSecretion of hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 was enhanced by control-released bFGF. Vascular improvement was achieved in groups 4 and 5 according to laser Doppler perfusion imaging. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and CD31 immunohistochemical staining demonstrated an increase in the vascular density, vessel diameter, and thickness of vessel walls in groups 4 and 5. Cells positively stained for CD146, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 were observed around vessel walls in groups 4 and\u00a05.\nThese findings suggest that coadministration of ASCs and control-released bFGF facilitates angiogenesis in terms of vessel maturation in a murine ischemic hind limb model.",

    "abstract": "Pulse pressure is a noninvasive measure of arterial stiffness. Increased pulse pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. The effects of pulse pressure on outcomes after endovascular interventions for critical limb ischemia (CLI), however, are unknown. We thus evaluated whether increased preoperative pulse pressure was associated with adverse outcomes and mortality in patients who underwent endovascular tibial artery intervention.\nAll patients who underwent endovascular tibial intervention for CLI at a single institution from 2004 to 2014 were included in this study. Preoperative pulse pressure was derived from measurements obtained in the holding area before the procedure. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of pulse pressure, <80 or \u226580 mm Hg. Patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were documented, and outcomes including procedural complications, repeat intervention, amputation, and mortality were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to account for patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities.\nOf 371 patients, 186 patients had a preoperative pulse pressure <80 mm Hg and 185 had a preoperative pulse pressure \u226580 mm Hg. No significant differences in patient demographic characteristics or comorbidities were identified; however, there was a trend toward older age in patients with increased pulse pressure (70 vs 72; P = .07). In univariate analysis, procedural complications (21% vs 13%; P = .02), reinterventions (26% vs 17%; P < .01), and restenosis (32% vs 23%; P = .03) were more common among patients with pulse pressure \u226580. Procedural complications remained significant in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.1; P = .04). There was no difference in 30-day mortality; however, increased mortality was seen at 5 years of follow-up (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.5; P = .04) in multivariable analysis.\nIncreased preoperative pulse pressure is associated with procedural complications and increased mortality in patients who undergo endovascular tibial intervention for CLI. It is a marker of increased risk, and might be a suitable target for interventions aimed at improving outcomes in this high-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing major lower extremity amputations are at risk for a wide variety of perioperative complications. Elderly patients with any functional impairment have been shown to be at high risk for these adverse events. Our goal was to determine the association between the type of anesthesia-general anesthesia (GA) and regional/spinal anesthesia (RA)-on perioperative outcomes after lower extremity amputation in these elderly and functionally impaired patients.\nThe American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) data set (2005-2012) was queried to identify all patients aged \u226575 years with partial or total functional impairment who underwent major lower extremity amputations. Propensity matching and multivariate analysis were performed to isolate the effect of anesthesia type.\nWe identified 3260 patients (50% male), 2558 GA patients and 702 RA patients, who were a mean age of 82 years. Anatomic distribution was 59% above-the-knee and 41% below-the-knee amputations. Patients undergoing GA were more likely to have impaired sensorium (9% vs 6%; P = .035), be on anticoagulation or have a bleeding disorder (33% vs 17%; P < .001), have had a previous operation \u226430 days (16% vs 10%; P < .001), and be operated on by a nonvascular surgeon (16% vs 12%; P = .033). GA was associated with shorter anesthesia time to surgery (36 \u00b1 48 vs 42 \u00b1 49 minutes; P < .001) but a similar operative time (66 \u00b1 33 vs 64 \u00b1 33 minutes; P = .292) compared with RA. After propensity matching, rates of 30-day mortality (14% vs 12%; P = .135), postoperative myocardial infarction/cardiac arrest (2.9% vs 3.1%; P = .756), pulmonary complications (7.3% vs 6.7%; P = .632), stroke (0.7% vs 0.9%; P = .694), urinary tract infections (6.7% vs 6.5%; P = .887), and wound complications (7.6% vs 7.6%; P = .999) were similar in patients undergoing GA and RA, respectively. Median length of stay was similar in both groups (5 vs 5.5 days; P = .309). Multivariable analyses confirmed that anesthesia type did not significantly affect morbidity and mortality.\nThe mode of anesthesia, GA vs RA, did not have significant effect on perioperative outcomes after major lower extremity amputation in the functionally impaired geriatric population. These findings provide an evidence base that will allow surgeons, anesthesiologists, and patients to make an informed decision about anesthesia type for their procedure.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to examine the predictive value of the anatomic severity grading (ASG) score for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) on implant-related complications, systemic complications, and mortality at 30-day and midterm, defined as 2 years, follow-up assessments.\nPatients who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair for infrarenal AAAs between 2009 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed, and ASG scores were calculated from three-dimensonal computed tomography reconstructions. Two independent patient groups were created: those with a low ASG score (score <14) and those with a high ASG score (score \u226514).\nWe identified 190 patients (77% male), with a mean age of 73 years, and 84% Caucasian, with 104 patients in the low-score group and 86 in the high-score group. Within 30 days of the index endovascular aneurysm repair, 10 implant-related complications occurred in six patients (3%) and 25 systemic complications in 18 (9%). The incidence of 30-day implant-related complications was not significantly different between the low-score group (2 [2%]) and the high-score group (4 [5%]; P = .41). The incidence of patients with 30-day systemic complications was significantly different between the low-score group (5 [5%]) and the high score group (13 [15%]; P = .023). A composite end point of combined implant-related and systemic complications at 30 days showed there was a statistically significant difference between the low-score (7 [7%]) and high-score group (17 [20%]; P = .007). At a midterm follow up of 26 months (range, 1-64 months), implant-related complications occurred in 21 patients (11%), and systemic complications occurred in 29 (15%). The incidence of implant-related complications was significantly different between the low-score group (7 [7%]) and the high-score group (14 [16%]; P = .037). The incidence of midterm systemic complications was significantly different between the low-score group (11 [11%]) and the high-score group (18 [21%]; P = .048). A composite end point of combined implant-related and systemic complications at midterm follow-up resulted in a statistically significant difference between the low-score group (16 [15%]) and the high-score group (26 [30%]; P = .014). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the low-score group had fewer overall complications (combined implant-related and systemic) at 1 year (14% vs 34%) and 2 years (15% vs 45%) compared with the high-score group (P < .001). The low-scoring group also had significantly higher survival at 1 year (96% vs 86%) and 2 years (88% vs 84%) compared with the high-score group (P = .047).\nThe AAA ASG score can be used to predict patients at risk for midterm implant-related complications, 30-day and midterm systemic complications, and all-cause mortality.",

    "abstract": "Life expectancy and causes of death after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair are not well characterized. Population aging and improved secondary prevention may have modified the prognosis of these patients. We designed a retrospective cohort study to determine the vital prognosis, causes of death, and differences in outcome after intact and ruptured AAA.\nAll patients with AAA treated from 2003 to 2011 at a single university institution in The Netherlands were analyzed. Survival status was derived from civil registry data. Causes of death were obtained from death certificates. The primary end point was overall mortality. Secondary end points were cardiovascular, cancer-related, and AAA-related mortality. Predictors for perioperative and late survival were obtained by logistic regression and Cox regression models, respectively.\nThe study included 619 consecutive AAA patients (12% women; mean age, 72 years), of whom 152 (24.5%) had ruptured AAAs. Endovascular repair was performed in 390 (63%). Rupture (odds ratio [OR], 10.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.80-23.5), open repair (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.69-7.62), renal insufficiency (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.51-3.46), and age (OR, 1.08 per year; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15) were predictors of 30-day mortality. Five-year survival expectancy was 65% for intact AAA and 41% for ruptured AAA (P < .001). Cardiovascular deaths unrelated to the AAA occurred in 35% and cancer-related deaths in 29% of deceased patients. Predictors for late mortality were history of prior malignant disease (hazard ratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.99-4.03) and age (hazard ratio, 1.08 per year; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10). After 30 days, only six deaths (1.1%) were AAA related.\nEndovascular repair reduced perioperative mortality by threefold, but no survival benefit was observed at long term. After the perioperative period, survival of ruptured AAA and intact AAA patients was not different. Deaths were distributed in similar proportions between cardiovascular and cancer-related causes.",

    "abstract": "Existing literature on unplanned reoperation (UR) after vascular surgery is limited. The frequency of 30-day UR and its association with other adverse outcomes was analyzed.\nPatients who underwent vascular procedures in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2012) were abstracted. UR, captured by a distinct variable now available in the data set, and its association with complications, readmissions, mortality, and failure to rescue (FTR) were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate methods.\nAmong 35,106 patients, 3545 URs were performed on 2874 patients. The overall UR rate was 10.1%. Among patients who underwent URs, approximately 80.4%, 15.8%, and 3.8% had one, two, and three or more reoperations, respectively; 39.4% of URs occurred after initial discharge. Median time to UR was 7 days but varied by procedure. Procedures with the highest UR rates were embolectomy (18.2%), abdominal bypass (14.4%), and open procedures for peripheral vascular disease (13.8%). Common indications for UR were hemorrhage, graft failure or infection, thromboembolic events, and wound complications. Patients with URs had higher rates of subsequent complications (49.9% vs 19.9%; P < .001), readmission (41.8% vs 7.0%; P < .001), and mortality (8.0% vs 2.5%; P < .001) than those not undergoing URs. FTR was more likely among patients who had a UR (13.6% vs 9.3%; P < .001); this varied within procedure groups. After multivariate adjustment, UR was independently associated with mortality in an incremental fashion (for one UR: adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.5; for two or more URs: adjusted odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.2).\nURs within 30 days are frequent among patients undergoing vascular surgery and are associated with worse outcomes, including mortality and FTR.",

    "abstract": "Hospital readmissions after surgical operations are considered serious complications and have an impact on health care-associated costs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services strongly encourage identification and ramification of factors associated with hospital readmissions after operations. Despite advances in endovascular surgery, lower extremity arterial bypass remains the \"gold standard\" treatment for severe, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the factors associated with hospital readmission after lower extremity bypass surgery.\nThe 2013 lower extremity revascularization-targeted American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database and generalized 2013 general and vascular surgery NSQIP Participant Use Data File were used for this study. Patient, diagnosis, and procedure characteristics of patients undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for hospital readmission within 30 days after surgery.\nA total of 2646 patients (65% male, 35% female) were identified in the NSQIP database who underwent lower extremity open revascularization during the year 2013. Indications for operations included tissue loss (39%), rest pain (32%), and severe claudication (25%). Preoperative ankle-brachial indices were 0.4 to 0.9 (32%) and <0.4 (16.5%). A total of 425 patients (16%) were readmitted within 30 days of index operation. Risk factors associated with readmission included wound complication (odds ratio [OR], 8.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.68-10.92; P < .001), need for reoperation (OR, 5.95; 95% CI, 4.45-7.97; P < .001), postoperative myocardial infarction (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.25-3.83; P = .006), wound dehiscence (OR, 8.45; 95% CI, 4.54-15.71; P < .001), organ or space surgical site infection (OR, 7.62; 95% CI, 2.89-20.14; P < .001), postoperative pneumonia (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.28-5.52; P = .009), progressive renal insufficiency (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 1.52-11.11; P = .005), superficial surgical site infection (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 5.31-10.23; P < .001), urinary tract infection (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.42-5.01; P = .002), and deep wound infection (OR, 14.0; 95% CI, 7.62-24.80; P < .001).\nReadmission after lower extremity bypass surgery is a serious complication. Various factors put a patient at high risk for readmission. Return to the operating room, wound infection, amputation, deep venous thrombosis, and major reintervention on bypass are independent risk factors for hospital readmission. Return to the operating room is associated with a 5.95-fold increase in hospital readmission.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate accuracy and feasibility of fusion imaging during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).\nFrom January 2013 to January 2015 fusion imaging was used in 18 TEVAR procedures. Patients were prospectively enrolled for the survey and informed consent was obtained. Planning of the procedure and computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) segmentation with determination of all relevant surgical landmarks that should be displayed on fusion imaging was done using the preoperative CTA data. The registration was done with an intraoperative noncontrast-enhanced cone beam CT and CTA (three-dimensional [3D]-3D registration; n = 15) or with two fluoroscopic images in anteroposterior and lateral projection and the CTA (two-dimensional-3D registration; n = 3). An intraoperative digital subtraction angiography was performed to adjust fusion imaging and to allow accuracy measurement.\nFusion imaging was possible in all included patients. The median dose for noncontrast-enhanced cone beam CT imaging was 28.6 Gy/cm(2) (range, 17.9-43.3) and 0.46 Gy cm(2) for two fluoroscopic images in the two-dimensional-3D group. Full accuracy was achieved in two cases (11%), with a median deviation of 11.7 mm (range, 0.0-37.2). Manual realignment was possible in all cases.\nThis early experience shows that fusion imaging is feasible in TEVAR procedures using different registration methods. However, it shows a significant deviation in thoracic procedures because of different sources of error, making confirmation of fusion overlay with a digital subtraction angiography necessary in any case.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons are an innovative group, and during the last decade, we have seen unparalleled advances in the endovascular treatment of extensive aortic pathologies. Collaborative efforts between surgeons and industry have introduced fenestrated and branched devices that are becoming more widely used, with wider regulatory approval, availability, and less need for customization. Prior to this, parallel stent approaches had been developed to fill the void where this technology was not available or for urgent cases. A separate and distinct body of evidence and expertise subsequently developed for both strategies. This debate explores where these approaches now sit in the armamentarium of vascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) has been the mainstay for diagnosing carotid artery stenosis and is often the sole diagnostic modality used prior to intervention. Highly calcified plaque, however, results in an acoustic shadow (AcS) that obscures the vessel lumen and inhibits the sonographer's ability to obtain Doppler velocity measurements. It is unknown whether DUS can accurately determine the degree of carotid stenosis in these settings.\nFrom July 2012 to December 2013, all patients with AcS on DUS measuring \u22655\u00a0mm in the longitudinal axis were cross-referenced with multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MD-CTA) images of the neck to define the study population. After standardizing the MD-CTA windows, percent stenosis was determined by cross-sectional area reduction using two separate previously described methods based on North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) criteria. DUS waveform parameters in the internal carotid artery near the AcS were then compared with these MD-CTA measurements to determine the accuracy of DUS in characterizing the severity of carotid stenosis.\nDuring this period, 8517 DUS studies were performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, 550 of which had AcS, for an incidence of 6.45%. There were 92 lesions with a concomitant MD-CTA; however, seven were excluded because of poor study quality, because \u22656\u00a0months had elapsed between DUS and MD-CTA, or because the patient had undergone carotid reconstruction between studies. Of the 85 remaining lesions, DUS characterized 17 as severe (peak systolic velocity [PSV] >250\u00a0cm/s), 31 as moderate (PSV\u00a0= 151-250\u00a0cm/s), and 37 as mild (PSV \u2264150\u00a0cm/s) stenoses using PSV criteria. PSV weakly correlated with CTA-NASCET (r\u00a0= 0.361; P\u00a0= .004) and CTA-ECST (r\u00a0= 0.306; P\u00a0= .004) percent stenosis. Using PSV >250\u00a0cm/s as the predictor of >70% stenosis, and a \u226570% cutoff by both CTA-ECST and CTA-NASCET methods as the reference measure, DUS sensitivity ranged from 22.7% to 32.5%, specificity from 89.4% to 91.1%, positive predictive value from 88.2% to 76.4%, and negative predictive value from 25% to 60.2%. A subgroup analysis of lesions identified as non-severe by DUS revealed that waveforms with lower deceleration were associated with severe stenosis on CTA.\nIn the presence of AcS, DUS alone is inadequate to accurately determine the degree of carotid stenosis with sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values far below that needed for clinical decision-making. MD-CTA may be necessary for improved characterization of plaque in these AcS lesions. Further studies are needed to determine DUS parameters that may identify patients who should undergo further evaluation with MD-CTA to characterize the true severity of the stenosis.",

    "abstract": "This report presents the 30-day results of the Safety and Efficacy Study for Reverse Flow Used During Carotid Artery Stenting Procedure (ROADSTER) multicenter trial and evaluates the safety and efficacy of ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS (Silk Road Medical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif), a novel transcarotid neuroprotection system that provides direct surgical common carotid access and cerebral embolic protection via high-rate flow reversal during carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nA prospective, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS during CAS procedures performed in patients considered to be at high risk for complications from carotid endarterectomy. Symptomatic patients with \u226550% stenosis and asymptomatic patients with \u226570% stenosis were eligible to be treated with any U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved carotid artery stent. The primary end point was the composite of all stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death at 30\u00a0days postprocedure as defined in the Food and Drug Administration-approved study protocol. Secondary end points included cranial\u00a0nerve injury; 30-day stroke, death, stroke/death, and MI; acute device, technical, and procedural success; and access site complications. All major adverse events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.\nBetween November 2012 and July 2014, 208 patients were enrolled at 18 sites. Sixty-seven patients were enrolled as lead-in cases, and 141 were enrolled in the pivotal phase. In the pivotal cohort, 26% were symptomatic and 75% were asymptomatic. Acute device and technical success were 99% (140 of 141). By hierarchical analysis, the all-stroke rate in the pivotal group was 1.4% (2 of 141), stroke and death was 2.8% (4 of 141), and stroke, death and MI was 3.5% (5 of 141). One patient (0.7%) experienced postoperative hoarseness from potential Xth cranial nerve injury, which completely resolved at the 6-month follow-up visit.\nThe results of the ROADSTER trial demonstrate that the use of the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is safe and effective at preventing stroke during CAS. The overall stroke rate of 1.4% is the lowest reported to date for any prospective, multicenter clinical trial of CAS.",

We report odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the outcomes of interest pooling data across studies using the random effects model.\nWe included 19 studies that enrolled 2779 patients. None of the nonrevascularization-based treatments were associated with a significant effect on mortality. Intermittent pneumatic compression (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.55) and spinal cord stimulators (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.79) were associated with reduced risk of amputation. A priori established subgroup analyses (combined vs single therapy; randomized vs nonrandomized) were not statistically significant.\nVery low-quality evidence, mainly due to imprecision and increased risk of bias, suggests that intermittent pneumatic compression and spinal cord stimulators may reduce the risk of amputations. Evidence supporting other medical therapies is insufficient.",

    "abstract": "We compared the outcomes and the durability of endovascular recanalization (EVR) with the Viabahn (W.\u00a0L.\u00a0Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) covered stent graft vs traditional aortobifemoral or aortofemoral bypass grafting for complex aortoiliac occlusions.\nBetween 2008 and 2014, 11 unilateral iliac occlusions and 11 aortobiiliac occlusions were treated by EVR. Also collected were data from the last 21 consecutive patients treated in the same period by aortofemoral (n\u00a0= 6) or aortobifemoral (n\u00a0= 15) bypass grafting. In accordance with the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II (TASC II) document, only patients with type D lesions were considered. Kaplan-Meier estimates for patency were calculated, and Cox proportional hazard modeling was performed.\nThe difference in risk factors between the groups was not significant. General anesthesia was required in 100% of the surgical group, and local or locoregional anesthesia was used for EVR. Suprarenal aortic cross-clamping was required in nine of the open surgical procedures (41%). A brachial percutaneous approach was performed in all patients undergoing EVR, and technical success was 100% in both groups. All of the attempts at EVR were successful. At the 2-year follow-up, primary patency did not differ significantly between the endovascular (91%) and surgical (95%) groups. This was seen in the univariate model (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-2.95; P\u00a0= .28) and in the multivariate model (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.06-10.07; P\u00a0= .84) for group (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.04-7.72; P\u00a0= .68), age (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73-1.08; P\u00a0= .24), symptoms (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.42-9.46; P\u00a0= .39), and occlusion (HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 0.51-20.35; P\u00a0= .21). The average hospital length of stay was shorter for patients treated with ERV than for those treated with open surgery (3.9\u00a0\u00b1 2.2 vs 5.8\u00a0\u00b1 3.1\u00a0days, respectively; P\u00a0= .03). The complication rate was 4% for EVR vs 18% in the surgical group (P\u00a0= .32).\nAt 2\u00a0years of follow-up, the results of endoluminal bypass grafting with the Viabahn stent to treat complex aortoiliac disease are promising. Longer-term results are needed to fully evaluate the potential benefits and longer-term patency.",

    "abstract": "Interruption of the hypogastric artery by ligation, embolization, or coverage frequently results in ischemic complications. The aim of this study was to compare the rate and risk factors for the development of ischemic complications after interruption of the hypogastric artery in obstetrics and gynecology (OBG), vascular surgery, oncology, and trauma patients.\nMEDLINE, Ovid, and Scopus were searched for articles containing data of patients who underwent interruption of the hypogastric artery. Based on the indication, details of the procedure, and complications developed, data were categorized and a systematic review was done to evaluate any significant differences.\nA total of 394 patients (median age, 48.5 years) from 124 papers were included in the study; 31% of the study population was male and 69% was female. Indication for interruption was OBG related in 53.3%, vascular surgery related in 25.1%, oncology related in 17.5%, and trauma related in 4.1% of patients. Overall ischemic complication rate was 22.6%, comprising buttock claudication in 12.2%, buttock necrosis in 4.8%, erectile dysfunction in 2.7%, spinal cord ischemia in 4.0%, colonic ischemia in 2.5%, and bladder necrosis in 0.8%. Complications were fewer in patients younger than the median age of 48.5 years (12.8%) compared with those older than the median age (36.3%; P < .01), women compared with men (13.1% vs 41.7%; P < .01), OBG patients compared with vascular surgery patients (9.5% vs 37.4%; P < .01), patients after ligation compared with embolization (9.4% vs 31.0%; P < .01), and proximal interruption compared with distal interruption (19.6% vs 51.4%; P < .01). No significant difference in complications was seen after bilateral interruption compared with unilateral interruption (20.6% vs 27.1%; P > .05). Similarly, no significant difference in complication rate was seen with the type of embolization material used. Among OBG patients, ligations resulted in fewer complications compared with embolization (4.1% vs 16.7%; P < .01). Among vascular surgery patients, bilateral embolization resulted in a higher rate of complications compared with bilateral ligation (83.3% vs 30.5%; P < .01). Among oncology patients, fewer complications were seen after proximal interruption compared with distal interruption (25.5% vs 75%; P = .01). No significant differences in outcome were seen with regard to gender, laterality, and material used for embolization when patients were compared within each specialty.\nInterruption of the hypogastric artery is relatively safe in young and OBG patients compared with vascular surgery and oncology patients. Ligation of the hypogastric arteries is preferred to embolization, and proximal embolization should be preferred to distal embolization to decrease the risk of ischemic complications. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample size are needed to definitively elucidate clear risk factors for development of complications after hypogastric artery interruption.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel surgical technique to facilitate the second-stage elevation of the basilic or brachial vein in patients with first-stage brachial-basilic or autogenous brachial-brachial arteriovenous fistula by axial splitting of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (MABCN). Filaments of the MABCN typically traverse the anterior aspect of the basilic and brachial veins. The second-stage elevation/shelf superficialization of the basilic or brachial vein, so as not to cause an injury to the MABCN, requires division of these veins with transposition over the nerve branches and subsequent reanastomosis. Our method of axial splitting of the MABCN enables elevation and shelf superficialization of the basilic or brachial vein without the division and reanastomosis of the vein. Twenty-eight patients underwent this simplified elevation. The nerve perineurium was incised longitudinally, nerve fibers were divided intrafascicularly, and cutaneous nerve branches were retracted aside. The vein was elevated between the divided nerves. On discharge and at 1-month follow-up, only one patient complained of localized patch hypoesthesia as reported in a simplified neurologic assessment questionnaire and neurologic examination.",

    "abstract": "Recent initiatives to improve health care quality have focused attention on length of stay (LOS) and readmission rates for surgical patients, yet these two outcomes may be inversely related. This study was designed to elucidate the risk factors for both outcomes and to clarify the relationship between them in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass (LEB).\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients who underwent LEB were identified from the 2007-2010 California State Inpatient Database. LOS and risk factors were analyzed using Poisson regression. Risk factors for 30-day readmission were analyzed using logistic regression.\nThere were 6307 patients who underwent LEB, and 1291 (20%) were readmitted. The average index LOS was 8.3\u00a0days for those who were readmitted and 5.5\u00a0days for those who were not (P\u00a0< .0001) and was an independent risk factor for 30-day readmission. The significant factors with the largest effect estimates for increased LOS reflected disease severity and postoperative complications: emergency department admission; advanced PAD; postoperative pneumonia, respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, wound/graft infection, graft complication, and discharge to a nursing facility. Independent predictors of readmission, other than LOS, reflected underlying patient factors: advanced PAD, chronic lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, postoperative congestive heart failure, and discharge status. Age, Medicaid or private insurance, and low income were protective. Of the 1291 readmissions, 453 (35%) were for definitive complications.\nIn patients undergoing LEB, LOS is primarily associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications, whereas 30-day readmission is largely explained by underlying patient illness. Additionally, increased LOS is an independent risk factor for readmission. These findings suggest that efforts to reduce both LOS and readmission will be complementary. Furthermore, they support the notion that both LOS and 30-day readmission rates should be risk-adjusted.",

    "abstract": "This study retrospectively analyzed our 33-year experience with surgical management of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs), with particular attention paid to early and long-term results.\nFrom January 1981 to December 2013, 234 open surgical interventions for PAA were performed in 196 patients. Data concerning these interventions were collected in a dedicated database containing main preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative features. Early (intraoperative and\u00a0<30\u00a0days) results were analyzed for mortality, thrombosis, reintervention, and amputation rates. The follow-up program consisted of clinical and duplex ultrasound examinations at 1\u00a0month and yearly thereafter. Patients who did not accomplish follow-up examinations were interviewed by telephone. Additional data regarding long-term survival and major clinical events were obtained from the Regional Health Care database. Follow-up results were analyzed for survival, primary and secondary patency, and amputations rates.\nPatients were predominantly males (186 [95%]), with a mean age of 68.5\u00a0\u00b1 9.9\u00a0years. The PAA was asymptomatic in 97 limbs, intermittent claudication was present in 68, and limb-threatening ischemia was present in 62. Aneurysmal rupture occurred in six patients, and venous compression with leg swelling and pain was present in one patient. The intervention consisted of aneurysmal ligation and bypass grafting in 122 interventions, aneurysmectomy with graft interposition was used in 108, and four patients underwent aneurysmectomy with an end-to-end anastomosis. An autologous vein was used in 49 interventions, and a prosthetic graft was used in 181. In 71 interventions a posterior approach was used, and in the remaining 163, a medial approach was preferred. There were two perioperative deaths, with a cumulative mortality rate of 1%. Perioperative thrombosis occurred after 18 interventions (7.7%). A successful reintervention was performed in 10 of those patients, whereas surgical thrombectomy was ineffective in one patient and leg amputation was necessary. The remaining seven patients underwent major amputation without any new surgical attempt. An adjunctive major amputation was necessary in a patient with a patent bypass for irreversible foot ischemia. The cumulative rate of amputations at 30\u00a0days was 3.8% (9 of 234 limbs). Mean duration of follow-up was 62\u00a0months (range 1-312\u00a0months). During follow-up, 31 deaths, 45 thromboses, and 10 amputations were recorded. The estimated 13-year survival rate was 50.8% (standard error [SE], 0.07%); during the same interval, primary patency, secondary patency, and limb preservation rates were 55.1% (SE, 0.05%), 68% (SE, 0.05%), and 86% (SE, 0.04%).\nOpen surgical repair of PAAs provided good results in our experience, with low rates of perioperative complications and an excellent durability in the very long-term setting, representing the benchmark for alternative techniques such as endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Narrowing of the distal aortic bifurcation can result in stent graft compression or arterial disruption during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). The aim of our study was to evaluate results of EVAR in patients with narrow distal aortic bifurcations.\nWe reviewed the clinical data of 1070 patients who underwent EVAR between 2000 and 2011. Digital computed tomography angiograms were analyzed using centerline of flow measurements to determine aortic diameters. Patients with a distal aortic bifurcation diameter <18 mm were included in the study. End points were technical success, aortic disruption with retroperitoneal hemorrhage, stent graft complications (endoleaks, migration, sac enlargement, stenosis), reintervention, and iliac limb patency.\nEVAR was used to treat 112 patients (84 men and 28 women; mean age, 75 years) with aortic bifurcation <18 mm, including 34 (30%) who had diameter of <14 mm. Mean outer and inner aortic bifurcation diameter was 16 \u00b1 3 and 14 \u00b1 2 mm, respectively. Bifurcated stent grafts were used in 106 patients (95%). Six patients (5%) had planned aortouniiliac converters with femoral crossover graft. The aortic bifurcation was dilated after placement of bifurcated stent grafts using kissing balloon angioplasty in 80 patients (75%). All bifurcated stent grafts were successfully implanted, with no conversions to open repair or aortouniiliac converters. There were two early deaths (1.8%), and 12 patients (11%) developed early complications. No aortic disruptions or retroperitoneal hematomas occurred in the group treated with bifurcated grafts. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 11 patients (11%) treated by bifurcated stent grafts required reintervention to treat endoleak (n = 6) or iliac limb stenosis/occlusion (n = 5). One patient (17%) treated by aortouniiliac converter developed critical stenosis of an aortouniiliac graft limb, which was successfully treated with balloon angioplasty 29 months after the initial surgery. At 1 and 5 years, freedom from reintervention was 91% \u00b1 3% and 84% \u00b1 4%, respectively, for bifurcated stent grafts and 100% and 83% \u00b1 10%, respectively, for aortouniiliac converters. Primary and secondary iliac limb patency was 98% \u00b1 3% and 100%, respectively, for bifurcated stent grafts and 83% \u00b1 10% and 100%, respectively, for aortouniiliac converters.\nEVAR with bifurcated stent grafts is safe and effective in patients with a narrow distal aortic diameter, even when the aortic bifurcation measures <14 mm. Adjunctive balloon dilatation did not result in any bleeding complications from aortic disruption, and limb patency was excellent. Aortouniiliac converters are rarely needed for this indication.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the performance of the Aorfix endograft (Lombard Medical, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom) in standard (<60\u00b0), highly angled (60\u00b0-90\u00b0), and severely angled (>90\u00b0) aortic necks in the PYTHAGORAS study and evaluated changes in neck morphology over time.\nPYTHAGORAS is a prospective nonrandomized clinical trial of the Aorfix endograft. We divided the endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) cohort into groups by standard, high, and severe neck angle. The primary control group was patients concurrently undergoing open repair. Mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years and 30-day freedom from Society for Vascular Surgery major adverse events for the EVAR groups was compared with the open control. Aneurysm sac change, type I and III endoleaks, graft migration, and the reintervention rate at 1 and 2 years was compared between the standard, highly, and severely angled populations. The relative risk of graft complications with a neck diameter increase >10% was also calculated. At predetermined anatomic points, the effect of oversizing on aortic diameter was evaluated by calculating oversize percentage ([1 - outer aortic diameter measured at a given time/stent graft diameter] \u00d7 100%) preoperatively and at 3 years. In addition, the average oversizing percentage at 30 days and annually at 1 to 5 years was compared with the preoperative oversizing percentage. Finally, complication rates with \u226530% vs <30% planned oversizing were compared.\nThe adverse event rate was lower for every EVAR group than the open control. In addition, the mortality rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years were similar between the standard-angle (1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5%), high-angle (0.9%, 7.3%, 13.8%), and severe-angle (4.8%, 9.5%, 14.3%) EVAR groups and the open control groups (1.3, 6.6%, 10.5%). At 1 and 2 years, there was no difference in graft complications among the EVAR groups. However, with neck dilatation of >10% at 5 mm above the proximal renal and 1 mm below the distal renal, there was an increased risk of graft migration (relative risk, 4.38 [P = .01] and 4.33 [P = .002], respectively). For all predetermined anatomic points, the oversizing percentage decreased over time. The rate of oversize percentage decrease was faster at more distal aortic locations, reaching <10% at 30 days 15 mm below the renal, at 2 years 7 mm below the renal, and at 5 years 1 mm below the renal (P < .001 for all).

    "abstract": "The arteriovenous graft (AVG) is most often used in hemodialysis patients when an autogenous fistula is not feasible. The optimal location (forearm or upper arm) and configuration (loop or straight) of AVGs are not known. To evaluate relationships of AVG location and configuration with patency, we conducted a secondary analysis using data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dipyridamole plus aspirin for newly placed AVG.\nParticipants of the Dialysis Access Consortium (DAC) Graft Study with newly placed upper extremity prosthetic grafts involving the brachial artery were studied. Multivariable analyses adjusting for trial treatment group, center, gender, race, body mass index, diabetes, current treatment with chronic dialysis, and prior arteriovenous vascular access or central venous catheter were performed to compare outcomes of forearm (fAVG) and upper arm (uAVG) grafts, including loss of primary unassisted patency (LPUP) and cumulative primary graft failure (CGF). Subgroup analyses of graft configuration and outflow vein used were also conducted.\nA total of 508 of the 649 participants (78%) enrolled in the trial had an upper extremity brachial artery graft placed, 255 with fAVG and 253 with uAVG. Participants with fAVG were less often male (33% vs 43%; P\u00a0= .03), African American (62% vs 78%; P\u00a0< .001), and receiving dialysis at the time of surgery (62% vs 80%; P\u00a0< .001). Participants with fAVG had a higher mean body mass index (33 vs 29; P\u00a0< .001). The LPUP (fAVG 70% vs uAVG 78%; P\u00a0= .07) and CGF (33% vs 36%; P\u00a0= .91) were similar between fAVG and uAVG at 1-year follow-up. In multivariable analysis, AVG\u00a0location (uAVG vs fAVG) was not associated with LPUP (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.63; P\u00a0= .20) or CGF (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.97; P\u00a0= .10). LPUP did not differ significantly between fAVG and uAVG among subgroups based on AVG configuration (P\u00a0= 1.00) or outflow vein used (P\u00a0= .16).\nPatency was comparable between fAVG and uAVG despite the larger caliber veins often encountered in the upper arm in carefully selected patients. Our findings support the traditional view that, in order to preserve a maximal number of access sites, the forearm location should be considered first before resorting to an upper arm graft.",

All patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database. Thirty-day outcomes, mid-term patency, limb salvage, and survival were compared, and follow-up results were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves. Clinical presentation, lesion site, extension, and laterality were evaluated for their association with patency in the two groups using multiple logistic regressions.\nPatients were a mean age of 70\u00a0\u00b1 10.3\u00a0years, The Society for Vascular Surgery comorbidity score was 0.89\u00a0\u00b1 0.57, with no differences after stratification by CS and BMS (P\u00a0= .17). Iliac lesions were classified by limb as TASC II C in 86 (51%) and D in 81 (49%). Comparing CS and BMS, technical success was 99% in both groups (P\u00a0= 1.0); the 30-day cumulative surgical complications rate (7.3% vs 4.7%; P\u00a0= .53), mortality (1.8% vs 0%; P\u00a0= .45), and morbidity (1.8% vs 1.4%; P\u00a0= .99) were equivalent. At 24\u00a0months (average 22\u00a0months; range, 30 days-56 months), primary patency of CS vs BMS was similar (93% vs 80%; P\u00a0= .14), and this finding was maintained after stratification by TASC II C (97% vs 93%; P\u00a0= .59) and D (88% vs 61%; P\u00a0= .07); secondary patency was 98% vs 92% (P\u00a0= .22), and limb salvage was 99% and 95% (P\u00a0= .35) respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that BMS in long-segment stenosis involving the common and external iliac arteries was a negative predictor of patency (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.62; P\u00a0= .007); within this subgroup of TASC II D lesions, primary patency at 24\u00a0months was significantly higher for CS than for BMS (88% vs 57%; P\u00a0= .03).\nOverall, the use of CSs for severe iliac lesions has similar early and midterm outcomes compared with BMS. In a subcategory of TASC II D lesions with long-segment severe stenosis of both the common and external iliac arteries, CS should be considered as the primary line of treatment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the evolution in perioperative outcomes and costs of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) by detailing changes in adjusted outcomes and costs over time.\nNational Inpatient Sample (2000-2011) data were used to evaluate patient characteristics, outcomes, and perioperative costs for elective EVAR performed for intact AAA. Outcomes were adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities, and hospital factors by multivariate analysis. Costs were calculated from hospital cost to charge ratio files and adjusted to 2011 dollars.\nFrom 2000 to 2011, 185,249 patients underwent elective EVAR for intact AAA. The absolute rates of in-hospital major morbidity, mortality, and procedural costs all decreased significantly over time (P\u00a0< .0001). The prevalence of major comorbidities in patients undergoing EVAR, including obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, all increased significantly over time. After adjusting for multiple demographics, comorbidities, and hospital-level factors, recent outcomes of EVAR (2009-2011) remain superior to the early experience (2000-2002) with respect to mortality and major complications.\nFrom 2000-2011, the perioperative outcomes of EVAR improved significantly despite a higher prevalence of comorbidities among patients undergoing repair. Concurrently, procedure-associated costs declined. Advanced technology is often implicated in escalating healthcare spending, and the value of novel techniques is often questioned. These findings highlight that, in the case of EVAR, procedural outcomes have improved while the initial costs of repair have declined over time. EVAR offers an interesting example for stakeholders to consider in the era of cost-containment pressures and criticism of nascent, expensive technology in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Optimal patient selection for lower extremity revascularization remains a clinical challenge among the hemodialysis-dependent (HD). The purpose of this study was to examine contemporary real world open and endovascular outcomes of HD patients to better facilitate patient selection for intervention.\nA regional multicenter registry was queried between 2003 and 2013 for HD patients (N\u00a0= 689) undergoing open surgical bypass (n\u00a0= 295) or endovascular intervention (n\u00a0= 394) for lower extremity revascularization. Patient demographics and comorbidities were recorded. The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes included graft patency, freedom from major adverse limb events, and amputation-free survival (AFS). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for death and amputation.\nAmong the 689 HD patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, 66% were male, and 83% were white. Ninety percent of revascularizations were performed for critical limb ischemia and 8% for claudication. Overall survival at 1, 2, and 5\u00a0years survival remained low at 60%, 43%, and 21%, respectively. Overall 1- and 2-year AFS was 40% and 17%. Mortality accounted for the primary mode of failure for both open bypass (78%) and endovascular interventions (80%) at two years. Survival, AFS, and freedom from major adverse limb event outcomes did not differ significantly between revascularization techniques. At 2\u00a0years, endovascular patency was higher than open bypass (76% vs 26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.71; P\u00a0= .02). Multivariate analysis identified age \u226580\u00a0years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% CI,\u00a01.4-2.5; P\u00a0< .01), indication of rest pain or tissue loss (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6; P\u00a0< .01), preoperative wheelchair/bedridden status (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1; P\u00a0< .01), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9; P\u00a0< .01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; P\u00a0= .01) as independent predictors of death. The presence of three or more risk factors resulted in predicted 1-year mortality of 64%.\nOverall survival and AFS among HD patients remains poor, irrespective of revascularization strategy. Mortality remains the primary driver for these findings and justifies a prudent approach to patient selection. Focus for improved results should emphasize predictors of survival to better identify those most likely to benefit from revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Open surgical repair for acute aortic pathologies involving the visceral vessels is associated with morbidity and mortality rates of 40% to 70% and 30% to 60%, respectively. Due to these poor outcomes, the application of fenestrated/branched endovascular aortic repair (F/B-EVAR) has been expanded in this setting; however, durability remains unknown. The purpose of this analysis was to describe outcomes after F/B-EVAR for acute aortic disease.\nA single center retrospective review of all F/B-EVARs for acute aortic disease was completed. Primary end points included mortality and reintervention-free survival. Secondary end points were patency and freedom from endoleak, as well as change in aneurysm diameter and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Life-tables were used to estimate end points, while mixed statistical models were used to determine aneurysm diameter change.\nThirty-seven patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 67 \u00b1 10 years; 75% male) underwent F/B-EVAR for acute aortic disease, and median follow-up time was 10.3 months (range, 0.5-31.4 months). Indications included thoracoabdominal aneurysm (65%; n = 24), pararenal aneurysm (17%; n = 6), postsurgical anastomotic pseudoaneurysm (8%; n = 3), dissection (5%; n = 2), and penetrating ulcer (5%; n = 2). Mean preoperative aneurysm diameter was 7.3 \u00b1 1.8 cm. All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV or IV-E, and 38% (n = 14) had history of aortic repair. There were 105 visceral vessels revascularized (celiac, 26; superior mesenteric artery, 29; renal, 50) and 24 (65%) patients underwent three- or four-vessel repair. Technical success was 92% (n = 34), with no intraoperative deaths and one conversion (3%). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 2-60 days), and postoperative morbidity was 41% (n = 15; spinal cord ischemia, 14% [8% permanent]; pulmonary, 14%; renal, 14%; extremity ischemia, 8%; stroke, 5%; cardiac, 3%; bleeding, 3%) with 30-day mortality of 19% (n = 7; in-hospital, 8%; n = 3). Endoleak was detected at some point in follow-up in 27% (n = 10), and a majority were type II (n = 7). Six (16%) patients underwent reintervention, and no late conversions occurred. Postoperative imaging was available in 27 (73%), and one celiac fenestration lost patency at 12 months. One-year branch vessel patency and freedom from reintervention was 98% \u00b1 6% and 70% \u00b1 9%, respectively. Estimated 1- and 4-year survival were 70% \u00b1 8% and 67% \u00b1 8%, respectively. During follow-up, aortic diameter decreased 0.5 cm (95% confidence interval, 1.1-0.2; P = .1) while estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 2 mL/min/1.73 m(2).\nF/B-EVAR can be performed to treat a variety of symptomatic and/or ruptured paravisceral aortic pathologies. Perioperative morbidity and mortality can be significant; however, it is less than literature-based outcomes of open repair. Short-term fenestrated/branched graft patency is excellent, but reintervention is frequent, highlighting the need for diligent follow-up. Patients surviving the initial hospitalization for F/B-EVAR of acute aortic disease can anticipate good long-term survival.",

    "abstract": "A recent investigation has documented an increased risk of aneurysm-related complications after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of familial abdominal aortic aneurysms (fAAAs). We hypothesized that fAAA patients are not at increased risk for complications following open AAA repair or EVAR when compared with sporadic abdominal aortic aneurysm (spAAA) patients. To this end, we performed a single institution retrospective review.\nEpidemiologic data were collected through the electronic medical record. Family history data were obtained from a questionnaire administered at the initial vascular surgery consultation. Major adverse events were defined as myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, bowel ischemia, limb ischemia, multisystem organ failure, intracranial hemorrhage, paraplegia, hemorrhage, or death. Endoleaks were classified in accordance with the standardized reporting practices of the Society for Vascular Surgery. AAA-related complications were defined as the need for a secondary intervention due to endoleak, limb ischemia, or postimplantation rupture.\nA total of 392 patients with complete clinical data underwent elective AAA repair from 2004 to 2014. Of these 392 patients, 89 (23%) were classified as fAAA patients and 303 (77%) were classified as spAAA patients. With the exception of increased rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P\u00a0= .0009) and pack-years smoked (P\u00a0= .03) in spAAA patients, demographics did not differ. Sixty-two percent (n\u00a0= 55) of fAAA patients and 68% (n\u00a0= 205) of spAAA patients underwent EVAR (P\u00a0= .30). fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in major adverse events following open AAA repair (fAAA, 9% vs spAAA, 11%; P\u00a0= .75). Additionally, fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in major adverse events following EVAR (fAAA, 4% vs spAAA, 5%; P\u00a0= .70). Patients with fAAA did have a significantly increased rate of endoleak (fAAA, 24% vs spAAA, 12%; P\u00a0= .03) and secondary intervention following EVAR (fAAA, 21% vs spAAA, 12%; P\u00a0= .04).\nThe current study shows that patients with fAAA do not have increased perioperative morbidity following open or endovascular AAA repair. However, patients with fAAA do have an increased risk of endoleak and secondary intervention following EVAR. These findings suggest that EVAR and open AAA repair are both safe and effective for fAAA patients. The increased rate of endoleak and secondary intervention in patients with fAAA suggests that this subpopulation may benefit from closer post-EVAR surveillance or open surgical repair in good risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Topical hemostats are important adjuncts for stopping surgical bleeding. The safety and efficacy of Fibrocaps, a dry-powder, fibrin sealant containing human plasma-derived thrombin and fibrinogen, was evaluated in patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures.\nIn this single-blind trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01527357), adult patients were randomized 2:1 to Fibrocaps plus gelatin sponge (Fibrocaps) vs gelatin sponge alone. Results are presented for the patient subset undergoing vascular procedures with suture hole bleeding. The primary efficacy endpoint compared time to hemostasis (TTH) over 5\u00a0minutes. Safety follow-up continued to day\u00a029.\nA total of 175 patients were randomized and treated (Fibrocaps, 117; gelatin sponge, 58). Patients were predominately male (69%) and underwent arterial bypass (81%), arteriovenous graft formation (9%), or carotid endarterectomy (9%). Fibrocaps significantly reduced TTH compared with gelatin sponge (hazard ratio [HR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.1; median TTH, 2\u00a0minutes; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5 vs 4\u00a0minutes; 95% CI, 3.0-5.0; P\u00a0< .002). Significant reductions were also observed in patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet agents alone (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.0-7.4; P\u00a0= .03; n\u00a0= 33), anticoagulants alone (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-4.0; P\u00a0= .04; n\u00a0= 43), or both antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants (Fibrocaps vs gelatin sponge, HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.3; P\u00a0= .008; n\u00a0= 65). Incidences of common adverse events (procedural pain, nausea, constipation) were generally comparable between treatment arms. Anti-thrombin antibodies developed in 2% of Fibrocaps-treated patients and no-gelatin-sponge patients.\nFibrocaps, a ready-to-use, dry-powder fibrin sealant, was well-tolerated and reduced TTH in patients undergoing vascular procedures, including those receiving antiplatelet agents and/or anticoagulants, demonstrating its safety and usefulness as an adjunct to hemostasis.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed readmissions and their associated hospital costs after common vascular surgeries at a single institution.\nPatients undergoing open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, aortoiliac revascularization, or infrainguinal revascularization, from 2010 through 2012, were retrospectively evaluated. We compared 30- and 90-day readmission rates and costs by procedure group, and we tabulated reasons for readmission and procedures performed during readmission. We used both American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data and patient records; as NSQIP only captures 30-day data, we retrospectively reviewed patient charts to extend the evaluation to 90 days. Analyses were performed using parametric or nonparametric methods as appropriate.\nTwo hundred nineteen cases were analyzed; the overall rate of index admission survivors experiencing at least one readmission within 30 days was 17% and within 90 days, 27%. Median readmission costs were $10,700, which added 39% to the median index costs of $27,700. Over half of readmissions (55%) included an operation. The most common cause for readmission was related to wound complications, comprising approximately 30% of the entire readmission cohort. Independent drivers of readmission costs were the need for additional surgical procedures, the use of intensive care unit services, and the number of days spent in the hospital above the median. Total 90-day costs were statistically equivalent between open and endovascular procedures when including readmissions.\nWe found that vascular surgery readmissions occur at a rate of 17% at 30 days and 27% at 90 days. When including the costs of readmission for a wide variety of common vascular cases, there is no significant difference in total costs between endovascular and open procedures at 90 days.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis vascular accesses (VAs) are traditionally planned based on the nondominant upper extremity preoperative physical and sonographic vascular findings. Clinical guidelines advocate the use of the most suitably distended vein in the most distal location. Brachial plexus block (BPB), through its sympathectomy-like effect, promotes vasodilation and can thus further optimize vein recruitment and operative strategy. However, studies on its role in driving primary distal autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) placement are limited. We therefore evaluated a traditional approach of clinic-based VA planning against an on-table sonography-guided strategy under BPB.\nThis was a prospective observational study involving 110 consecutive end-stage renal disease multiethnic Asian patients referred for primary VA creation under BPB after preoperative venous mapping. Cases were grouped according to whether there was a preset operative plan for radial cephalic (RC) or brachial cephalic (BC) AVF creation based on artery and vein >2\u00a0mm and >2.5\u00a0mm size criteria respectively (group A) or vein size or length were suboptimal (2-2.5\u00a0mm and\u00a0<5\u00a0cm respectively), thus precluding any operative plan till after BPB (group B). Group B also included cases with a preset VA plan but that subsequently underwent an on-table change in operative plan as a result of more favorable distal vein dilation post-BPB. RC AVF recruitment, maturation, and patency rates were compared in the two groups over a 1-year follow up.\nOne hundred RC and BC AVF were available for analysis after excluding brachial AVFs and grafts: 41 in group A and 59 in group B. Twenty one (51%) primary RC AVFs were created according to a preset preoperative plan compared with 37 (63%) based upon on-table planning or plan modification (P > .05). Satisfactory post-BPB forearm vasodilation resulted in 44% of 36 plans for BC being changed to RC AVFs. RC AVF 6-week hemodynamic maturation and 3-month functional maturation in group A vs B were 48% vs 60% and 69% vs 57%, respectively (P > .05). One-year primary and secondary patency rates were 57% vs 50% and 73% vs 87%, respectively (log rank >.05). Outcomes of RC AVFs in group B were not inferior to those of BC AVFs.\nOn-table BPB-driven VA planning and plan modification strategy contribute to considerable AVF recruitment but do not lead to significantly better distal AVF prevalence or outcomes over the traditional approach. An adequately powered randomized controlled study is, however, warranted to better assess the long-term clinical and cost benefits of such a strategy.",

    "abstract": "Arterial acute mesenteric ischemia (AAMI) is a vascular and gastroenterologic emergency, most often surgical, still associated with a poor prognosis and frequent short bowel syndrome in survivors. We report the results of revascularization in AAMI patients after the creation of an intestinal stroke center.\nSince July 2009, we developed a multimodal and multidisciplinary management for AMI, focusing on intestinal viability and involving gastroenterologists, vascular and abdominal surgeons, radiologists, and intensive care specialists. This management was the first step to the creation of an intestinal stroke center, based on the stroke unit model. All patients received: (1) a specific medical protocol; (2) endovascular and/or open surgical revascularization whenever possible; and/or (3) resection of non-viable small bowel. We aimed to study survival, morbidity, type of revascularization, and bowel resection in patients who benefited from arterial revascularization in our intestinal stroke center.\nEighty-three patients with AMI were prospectively enrolled in the intestinal stroke center. Among them, 29 patients with AAMI underwent revascularization. The mean age was 50.2\u00a0\u00b1 12\u00a0years, with 41% of male gender. The mean follow-up was 22.7\u00a0\u00b1 19\u00a0months. Overall 2-year survival was 89.2%, and 30-day operative mortality was 6.9%. Surgical revascularization included bypass grafting (65%), endarterectomy with patch angioplasty (21%)\u00a0\u00b1 retrograde open mesenteric stenting of the superior mesenteric artery (7%), and endovascular revascularization as first stage procedure (38%). The 2-year primary patency rate of open revascularization was 88%. The rate and the median length of bowel resected were 24% and 43\u00a0cm (range, 36-49\u00a0cm), respectively.\nIn our experience, revascularization of AAMI patients as part of a multidisciplinary and multimodal management leads to encouraging results. Vascular surgeons have a central role in a dedicated intestinal stroke center.",

    "abstract": "Embolization of carotid stenotic plaques is the direct cause of stroke in nearly 20% of cases. Genetic mechanisms and especially the roles played by microRNAs in the regulation of plaque destabilization and rupture are mostly unknown. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the expression of seven microRNAs allegedly involved in plaque growth and instability (miR-100, 125a, 127, 133a, 145, 155, and 221), between symptomatic and asymptomatic human carotid plaques.\nThirty patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in our department were prospectively included. Carotid plaques were subdivided into symptomatic (n\u00a0= 15) and asymptomatic (n\u00a0= 15) according to the presence or absence of stroke. After isolation of total RNA from atherosclerotic plaques, microRNAs were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nThe two groups of patients were comparable in terms of age, gender, risk factors for cerebral ischemia, medication, and stenosis severity. All seven microRNAs were quantified in extracted carotid plaques. miR-100, miR-125a, miR-127, miR-133a, miR-145, and miR-221 were significantly overexpressed in symptomatic vs asymptomatic plaques. miR-125a expression was significantly inversely correlated with the circulating level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the symptomatic group.\nThis pilot study evaluated the expression of seven selected miRNAs in human carotid plaques from a small group of patients and suggested a potential regulatory role for these miRNAs in evolution of the plaque towards growth, instability and rupture. Studies based on larger sample sizes are required to determine the potential use of miR-100, miR-125a, miR-127, miR-133a, miR-145, and miR-221 as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for stroke.",

    "abstract": "There are few long term studies to show the safety and efficacy of iliac artery aneurysm exclusion, especially in regards to the straight iliac branched device. The objective of our study was to add our data with a mean follow-up of 32\u00a0months to the existing data available.\nPatients undergoing iliac bifurcation procedure either as standalone or in combination with abdominal aortic aneurysm exclusion at two vascular centers had data prospectively gathered between 2004 and 2014. Collected data was analyzed for baseline characteristics, procedural events, and clinical follow-up; variables included endoleaks, reinterventions, and internal iliac artery (IIA) closure.\nA total of 45 iliac vessels in 41 patients (36 male) with a mean age of 70.4\u00a0years were treated with the iliac branched device. Procedural success was achieved in 85% (35/41) of patients and 87% (39/45) vessels with no intraoperative death. Of the six technical failures, three occurred due to failure to place the straight iliac branched device or stent properly. Two occurred because of endoleaks at the end of the procedure, and one occurred because the IIA side-branch occluded and could not be reopened. The mean patient follow-up was 32.0\u00a0\u00b1 27.3\u00a0months (range, 0-109\u00a0months). During this time period, the IIA patency rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 81%, and the freedom from endoleak rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 76% per patient. The freedom from reintervention per patient was 75%. No patient reported symptoms of pelvic ischemia and permanent buttock claudication.\nIn this study with mean follow-up of 32\u00a0months, treatment with iliac bifurcated devices is a safe and durable option in a carefully selected population of patients with iliac artery bifurcation aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "To report an initial experience with physician-modified thoracic endografts for endovascular treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA).\nSingle-center cohort study of the treatment of TAAA using a physician-modified fenestrated thoracic endograft for patients deemed to be at high risk of open repair. The cohort includes 21 patients in a prospective physician-sponsored U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational device exemption study and three patients treated outside the investigational device exemption. The procedure involves physician modification of a Cook TX2 thoracic stent graft with reinforced fenestrations. Branch stents were iCast balloon expandable stents. Treatment success was defined as successful aneurysm exclusion with freedom from permanent organ system dysfunction and return to preoperative level of independent functional status.\nTwenty-four consecutive patients were treated. Twenty-one patients (88%) met the endpoint of treatment success at a mean of 11\u00a0months follow-up. One patient (4%) died within 30\u00a0days due to complications of spinal cord injury (SCI). One patient (4%) died 4\u00a0months postoperatively after a prolonged recovery from surgery. One other patient (4%) is alive 13\u00a0months after operation with permanent SCI. One renal reintervention has been required. No device failures have occurred.\nEarly-term data suggest that physician-modified fenestrated thoracic endografts can be used to safely and effectively treat TAAA in patients at high risk of open repair. Physician-modified devices perform similarly to commercially manufactured grafts in terms of treatment success, SCI, perioperative death, and clinical outcome at short-term follow-up. Physician modification is immediately available and allows for a high level of customizability. Procedure success is contingent upon careful preoperative planning, patient selection, experienced providers, and a high volume center.",

    "abstract": "A certain number of deaths may result from elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair due to inherent risks of operation; however, no agreement exists about which predictive model for in-hospital mortality is most accurate in predicting these events. This study developed a risk prediction model using Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) data and compared it with established models.\nVSGNE data (2003-2013) were queried for patients undergoing elective AAA repair by open or endovascular techniques. Clinical variables and known predictors of mortality were included in a full prediction model. Backward elimination with \u03b1\u00a0= .2 was used to construct a parsimonious model. This VSGNE model was compared with established models-Medicare, Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS), and Vascular Governance North West (VGNW)-based on the scope of VSGNE data collection. Model fit was compared with the Vuong test. Model discrimination was compared in equally sized risk-group VSGNE terciles.\nThe overall mortality rate for 4431 elective AAA patients was 1.4%. The discriminating ability of the VSGNE model was high (C statistic\u00a0= 0.822) and corrected slightly to 0.779 after internal validation. Vuong tests yielded significant overall fit difference favoring the VSGNE model over the Medicare (C statistic\u00a0= 0.769), VGNW (C statistic\u00a0= 0.767), and GAS (C statistic\u00a0= 0.685) models. The VGNW and Medicare models performed better than GAS in predicting mortality among risk-group terciles.\nThe VSGNE risk prediction model is best at forecasting mortality among this patient population. The Medicare and VGNW models showed good discrimination.",

    "abstract": "The femoropopliteal arteries are subjected to considerable axial and bending deformity due to flexion at the hip and knee joints. The Supera helical interwoven nitinol stent system (IDEV Technologies, Inc/Abbott Laboratories, Inc, Webster, Tex) has good conformability and flexibility, with a very low incidence of mechanical fatigue. This study reviewed our experience with the use of Supera stents for femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions and identified risk factors for restenosis or occlusion.\nPatients with symptomatic femoropopliteal atherosclerotic diseases who underwent lower limb angioplasty and Supera stent insertion were studied. All patients had regular clinical follow-up and underwent a Doppler ultrasound examination at 3\u00a0months and then every 6\u00a0months, and radiography of the stents at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36\u00a0months. Patency rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. We also evaluated the prospectively maintained cohort to identify predictors of restenosis.\nFrom October 2011 to December 2014, 164 legs in 153 symptomatic patients (96 male, 57 female) with femoropopliteal occlusive disease, with mean age of 76.7\u00a0years (range, 46-100\u00a0years), were included. Ninety-five patients (58%) had claudication, nine (5%) had rest pain, and 60 (37%) had tissue loss. Disease distribution was 64 proximal superficial femoral arteries (SFAs; 39%), 107 middle SFAs (65%), 127 distal SFAs (77%), 78 above-knee popliteal arteries (48%), and 19 below-knee popliteal arteries (12%). Lesion classification by TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) A, B, C, and D was 49 (30%), 79 (48%), 31 (19%), 3 (1%), respectively. The mean lesion length was 105.6\u00a0mm (range, 3-400\u00a0mm), and more than one Supera stent was inserted in 26 patients. Procedure success (residual stenosis\u00a0<30%) was achieved in 100% of procedures. The primary patency rates (>50% patency) at 6, 12, 24, and 30\u00a0months were (\u00b1standard error) 86.7%\u00a0\u00b1 3.1%, 81.4%\u00a0\u00b1 3.7%, 79.9%\u00a0\u00b1 4.0%, and 77\u00a0\u00b1 3.0%, respectively. The ankle-brachial pressure index increased from 0.57\u00a0\u00b1 0.15 preoperatively to 0.87\u00a0\u00b1 0.14 postoperatively. No stent fractures occurred. There were three 30-day deaths not related to the procedure or device, one major amputation 3\u00a0months after revascularization, and 29 late deaths (>30\u00a0days) of unrelated medical causes in follow-up. In-stent restenosis was associated with younger patient age and with dyslipidemia, long lesion, and stent length.\nOur midterm experience showed that the implantation of the helical interwoven nitinol stents in patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease is safe and effective, with encouraging patency rates and clinical results.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation includes inflammation, vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation, and oxidative stress. That multipotent stem cells have an important role in cardiovascular health and disease has been well established, but the role of stem cells in aortic structural deterioration is poorly defined. We sought to describe the presence of stem cells in human AAA tissue and also investigated the differentiation of stem cells within the aneurysmal aorta.\nInfrarenal aortic wall specimens were collected from patients (n\u00a0= 7) undergoing open AAA surgical repair. Nonaneurysmal infrarenal aortic control samples (n\u00a0= 4) were collected at autopsies. Using immunohistochemistry, we compared the abundance of Stro1-positive ((+)), c-kit(+), and CD34(+) cells in aortic tissue. Using double-immunofluorescence staining, we evaluated stem cell differentiation into smooth muscle cells (SM22), fibroblasts (FSP1), and macrophages (CD68). We then investigated the colocalization of CD68(+) cells with the cellular marker of proliferation Ki67.\nThe media and adventitia of infrarenal AAA samples both demonstrated a significantly greater number of c-kit(+) and CD34(+) cells compared with matched control nonaneurysmal aortic tissues; however, the abundance of Stro1(+) cells was not significantly different between the groups. Using double-immunofluorescence staining, we identified that AAA stem cells express the macrophage marker CD68 but not the smooth muscle cell marker SM22 or the fibroblast marker FSP1. CD68(+) cells within the aortic wall colocalized with the cellular marker of proliferation Ki67.\nStem cells are significantly elevated in infrarenal AAA tissue compared with matched control aortic tissue. Our data also demonstrate that AAA stem cells express macrophage surface antigens but not smooth muscle cell or fibroblast markers. Furthermore, CD68(+) cells within the aortic wall colocalized with the cellular marker of proliferation Ki67. These finding suggest an inflammatory/immune role of stem cells during AAA pathogenesis and raise the possibility of localized replenishment therapy within the aneurysm wall.",

    "abstract": "Although clinical studies have identified that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the p27(kip1) gene is associated with success or failure after vein bypass grafting, the underlying mechanisms for this difference are not well defined. Using a high-throughput approach in a flow-dependent vein graft model, we explored the differences in p27(kip1)-related genes that drive the enhanced hyperplastic response under low-flow conditions.\nBilateral rabbit carotid artery interposition grafts with jugular vein were placed with a unilateral distal outflow branch ligation to create differential flow states. Grafts were harvested at 2 hours and at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after implantation, measured for neointimal area, and assayed for cell proliferation. Whole-vessel messenger RNA was isolated and analyzed using an Affymetrix (Santa Clara, Calif) gene array platform. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity, Redwood City, Calif) was used to identify the gene networks surrounding p27(kip1). This gene set was then analyzed for temporal expression changes after graft placement and for differential expression in the alternate flow conditions.\nOutflow branch ligation resulted in an eightfold difference in mean flow rates throughout the 28-day perfusion period (P < .001). Flow reduction led to a robust hyperplastic response, resulting in a significant increase in intimal area by 7 days (0.13 \u00b1 0.04 mm(2) vs 0.014 \u00b1 0.006 mm(2); P < .005) and progressive growth to 28 days (1.37 \u00b1 0.05 mm(2) vs 0.39 \u00b1 0.06 mm(2); P < .001). At 7 days, low-flow grafts demonstrated a burst of actively dividing intimal cells (36.4 \u00b1 9.4 cells/mm(2) vs 11.5 \u00b1 1.9 cells/mm(2); P = .04). Sixty-five unique genes within the microarray were identified as components of the p27(kip1) network. At a false discovery rate of 0.05, 26 genes demonstrated significant temporal changes, and two dominant patterns of expression were identified. Class comparison analysis identified differential expression of 11 genes at 2 hours and seven genes and 14 days between the high-flow and low-flow grafts (P < .05). At 2 hours, oncostatin M and cadherin 1 were the most differentially expressed. Cadherin 1 and protein kinase B exhibited the greatest differential expression at 14 days.\nAlterations in flow and shear stress result in divergent patterns of vein graft remodeling. Associated with the dramatic increase in neointimal expansion observed in low-flow vs high-flow grafts is a subset of differentially expressed p27(kip1)-associated genes that correlate with critical stages in the adaptive response. These represent potential biologic targets whose activity may be altered to augment maladaptive vascular remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a rare condition that carries a critical risk of rupture and mortality. These risks are increased during pregnancy because of a progressively hyperdynamic pattern of circulation. Simultaneously, pregnancy-imposed limitations on the use of ionized radiation and intravenous contrast agents may render conventional techniques for imaging and repair confirmation less acceptable. We describe a novel approach to intraoperative management of an endovascular repair for symptomatic thoracic saccular aneurysm in a pregnant patient, based on intravascular ultrasound and transesophageal echocardiography, with maintenance of uterine perfusion. The patient recovered well and proceeded to a normal delivery. Despite a favorable outcome in this case, further studies of perioperative management of aortic disease in pregnancy are needed.",

    "abstract": "The development of spinal cord injury is believed to be related to the vulnerability of spinal motor neurons to ischemia. However, the mechanisms underlying this vulnerability have not been fully investigated. Previously, we reported that spinal motor neurons are lost likely due to autophagy and that local hypothermia prevents such spinal motor neuron death. Therefore, we investigated the role of autophagy in normothermic and hypothermic spinal cord ischemia using an immunohistochemical analysis of Beclin 1 (BCLN1; B-cell leukemia 2 protein [Bcl-2] interacting protein), Bcl-2, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which are considered autophagy-related proteins.\nWe used rabbit normothermic and hypothermic transient spinal cord ischemia models using a balloon catheter. Neurologic function was assessed according to the Johnson score, and the spinal cord was removed at 8\u00a0hours and 1, 2, and 7\u00a0days after reperfusion, and morphologic changes were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. A Western blot analysis and histochemical study of BCLN1, Bcl-2, and GABARAP, and double-labeled fluorescent immunocytochemical studies were performed.\nThere were significant differences in the physiologic function between the normothermic model and hypothermic model after the procedure (P\u00a0< .05). In the normothermic model, most of the motor neurons were selectively lost at\u00a07\u00a0days of reperfusion (P\u00a0< .001 compared with the sham group), and they were preserved in the hypothermic model (P\u00a0= .574 compared with the sham group). The Western blot analysis revealed that the sustained expression of the autophagy markers, BCLN1 and GABARAP, was observed (P\u00a0< .001 compared with the sham group) and was associated with neuronal cell death in normothermic ischemic conditions. In hypothermic ischemic conditions, the autophagy inhibitory protein Bcl-2 was powerfully induced (P\u00a0< .001 compared with the sham group) and was associated with blunted expression of BCLN1 and GABARAP and neuronal cell survival. The double-label fluorescent immunocytochemical study\u00a0revealed that immunoreactivitiy for BCLN1, Bcl-2, and GABARAP was induced in the same motor neurons.\nThese data suggest that the prolonged induction of autophagy might be a potential factor responsible for delayed motor neuron death, and the induction of the autophagy inhibitory protein Bcl-2 using hypothermia might limit autophagy and protect against delayed motor neuron death.",

Aneurysmal dilatation of the previously treated segment was noted in both patients during subsequent follow-up imaging. In the absence of other causal factors, we attribute both cases to PCB application. The aneurysms that formed had no detrimental effect on the patients' health and required no further treatment; however, it is important to bear in mind this potential risk of presumed paclitaxel toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular traps (ETs) consisting of DNA-protein complexes formed after tissue injury contribute to the inflammatory and thrombosis cascades, thereby exacerbating injury. Exogenous DNase I has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to limit injury in the brain and myocardium. These studies were designed to evaluate the effects of exogenous DNase I treatment on skeletal muscle injury after acute hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in mice and to determine whether neutrophils are a major source of ETs in postischemic muscle tissue.\nC57BL6 mice were subjected to 1.5\u00a0hours of tourniquet ischemia and 24\u00a0hours of reperfusion with and without human recombinant DNase I treatment. A separate set of mice was subjected to neutrophil depletion (ND), followed by the same intervals of IR. Laser Doppler imaging and tissue harvesting were done at 24\u00a0hours for assessment of limb perfusion, muscle fiber injury, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and formation of ETs.\nDNase I treatment significantly reduced detection of ETs in postischemic muscle but did not alter skeletal muscle fiber injury, levels of proinflammatory molecules, or ATP level. DNase I treatment did enhance postischemic hindlimb perfusion, decreased infiltrating inflammatory cells, and reduced the expression of thrombin-antithrombin III. ND resulted in a significant yet small reduction in ETs in the postischemic muscle. ND did not alter skeletal muscle fiber injury, hindlimb perfusion, or ATP levels.\nThese data suggest that neither DNase I treatment nor ND was protective against IR injury, even though both decreased detection of ETs in skeletal muscle after IR. Neutrophils are not the only source of ETs after IR.",

    "abstract": "This study characterized duplex ultrasound (DUS) findings and clinical outcomes associated with covered stent placement in renal arteries during fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (FEVAR) to determine if velocity criteria for native renal artery stenosis can be applied.\nData from a prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent FEVAR between January 2010 and August 2014 were obtained before FEVAR (preoperative or baseline) and at follow-up assessments at 30\u00a0days, 6\u00a0months, and 1, 2, and 3\u00a0years. The established DUS threshold criteria for \u226560% stenosis in native renal arteries were applied at baseline and all follow-up intervals: renal artery peak systolic velocity (PSV) \u2265200\u00a0cm/s or renal-aortic velocity ratio (RAR) \u22653.5.\nForty-nine patients underwent placement of 88 covered renal artery stents during FEVAR. At least 30-day follow-up was available for 43 patients with 80 stents. A \u226560% stenosis was identified in seven renal arteries of six patients on baseline DUS, and these patients were analyzed separately. The remaining 73 renal arteries were classified as normal or\u00a0<60% stenosis at baseline, with a median PSV of 121\u00a0cm/s (interquartile range, 96-143) and median RAR of 1.4 (interquartile range, 1.1-1.7). No significant differences were found between the baseline and follow-up PSV measurements at any time point. The RAR differed significantly at some time points, although median values remained below the \u226560% stenosis threshold. Some increased RAR values were attributed to low aortic velocities after repair. In the 13 patients with 17 covered renal artery stents found to have PSV or RAR exceeding a DUS threshold for \u226560% native renal artery stenosis, there was no evidence of stenosis by computed tomography angiography, of renal dysfunction by estimated glomerular filtration rate, or of renal volume decrease by three-dimensional analysis. None of the seven renal arteries with \u226560% stenosis at\u00a0baseline showed evidence of restenosis at 1, 2, or 3\u00a0years.\nCovered stent placement in nonstenotic renal arteries during FEVAR is safe and durable, with PSV and RAR remaining in the normal or\u00a0<60% stenosis range in most patients. Increases in PSV or RAR that occur are not associated with clinically significant sequelae or in-stent stenosis on computed tomography angiography. DUS velocity criteria for stenosis in native renal arteries appear to overestimate the severity of stenosis in covered stents after FEVAR.",

    "abstract": "Although smoking cessation is a key priority emphasized by professional societies and multidisciplinary consensus guidelines, significant variation exists in the methods and efficacy of smoking cessation treatment practiced by vascular surgeons. We conducted a series of patient, surgeon, and nonpatient stakeholder focus groups to identify important domains for establishment of a successful smoking cessation program.\nAs part of a planning effort for a randomized clinical trial on usual care vs a standardized, evidence-based smoking cessation intervention, our group performed a series of interviews and focus groups. These were four 1-hour interviews, conducted with stakeholders such as tobacco cessation counselors (n\u00a0= 2), a Quit Line representative (n\u00a0= 1), and a Vascular Quality Initiative leader (n\u00a0= 1), as well as two 90-minute, formal, professionally moderated focus groups, one with vascular surgeons (n\u00a0= 7), and another with patients (n\u00a0= 4). Transcripts and audio recordings were qualitatively reviewed for themes to establish the most important domains perceived to be associated with a successful smoking cessation program.\nPatients emphasized four domains critical for a successful smoking cessation program: the motivation to quit, an individualized approach, the timing of an intervention, and the tone of the physician who offers counseling. Although surgeons and nonpatient stakeholders also emphasized the importance of a compassionate physician tone, surgeons and nonpatient stakeholders differed from patients in their remaining domains. They emphasized the feasibility of a brief intervention in a busy clinical practice, implementation of the effort, and necessary infrastructure for smoking cessation programs. All focus group participants described a brief, evidence-based smoking cessation intervention as feasible in routine vascular practice.\nDifferences in motivation and significance exist for patients, surgeons, and stakeholders when they considered the specific domains most important in building a successful smoking cessation program. Despite these differences, all parties involved agreed that a brief, standardized intervention can be successful delivered in a busy vascular clinic setting.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative ischemic colitis (IC) can be a serious complication following infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. We sought to identify risk factors and outcomes in patients developing IC after open AAA repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to examine clinical data of patients undergoing AAA repair from 2011 to 2012 who developed postoperative IC. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors and outcomes.\nWe evaluated a cohort of 3486 patients who underwent AAA repair (11.6% open repair and 88.4% EVAR). The incidence of postoperative IC was 2.2% (5.2% for open repair and 1.8% for EVAR). Surgical treatment was needed in 49.3% of patients who developed IC. The mortality of patients with IC was higher than that of patients without IC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.26-7.92; P\u00a0< .01). The need for surgical treatment (AOR, 7.77; 95% CI, 2.08-28.98; P\u00a0< .01) and age (AOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22; P\u00a0= .01) were mortality predictors of IC patients. Predictive factors of IC included need for intraoperative or postoperative transfusion (AOR, 6; 95% CI, 3.08-11.72; P\u00a0< .01), rupture of the aneurysm before surgery (AOR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.78-9.31; P\u00a0< .01), renal failure requiring dialysis (AOR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.18-12.62; P\u00a0= .02), proximal extension of the aneurysm (AOR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.04-4.59; P\u00a0= .03), diabetes (AOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.01-3.46; P\u00a0= .04), and female gender (AOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.01-3.02; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04). Although open AAA repair had three times higher rate of postoperative IC compared with endovascular repair, in multivariate analysis we did not find any statistically significant difference between open repair and EVAR in the development of IC (5.2% vs 1.8%; AOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.70-2.25; P\u00a0= .43).\nPostoperative IC has a rate of 2.2% after AAA repair. However, it is associated with 38.7% mortality rate. Rupture of the aneurysm before surgery, need for transfusion, proximal extension of the aneurysm, renal failure requiring dialysis, diabetes, and female gender were significant predictors of postoperative IC. AAA patients who develop IC have four times higher mortality compared with those without IC. Surgical treatment is needed in nearly 50% of IC patients and is a predictor of higher mortality.",

    "results": "We evaluated a cohort of 3486 patients who underwent AAA repair (11.6% open repair and 88.4% EVAR). The incidence of postoperative IC was 2.2% (5.2% for open repair and 1.8% for EVAR). Surgical treatment was needed in 49.3% of patients who developed IC. The mortality of patients with IC was higher than that of patients without IC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.26-7.92; P\u00a0< .01). The need for surgical treatment (AOR, 7.77; 95% CI, 2.08-28.98; P\u00a0< .01) and age (AOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22; P\u00a0= .01) were mortality predictors of IC patients. Predictive factors of IC included need for intraoperative or postoperative transfusion (AOR, 6; 95% CI, 3.08-11.72; P\u00a0< .01), rupture of the aneurysm before surgery (AOR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.78-9.31; P\u00a0< .01), renal failure requiring dialysis (AOR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.18-12.62; P\u00a0= .02), proximal extension of the aneurysm (AOR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.04-4.59; P\u00a0= .03), diabetes (AOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.01-3.46; P\u00a0= .04), and female gender (AOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.01-3.02; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04). Although open AAA repair had three times higher rate of postoperative IC compared with endovascular repair, in multivariate analysis we did not find any statistically significant difference between open repair and EVAR in the development of IC (5.2% vs 1.8%; AOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.70-2.25; P\u00a0= .43).",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has long been recognized as a condition predominantly affecting males, with sex-associated differences described for almost every aspect of the disease from pathophysiology and epidemiology to morbidity and mortality. Women are generally spared from AAA formation by the immunomodulating effects of estrogen, but once they develop, the natural history of AAAs in women appears to be more aggressive, with more rapid expansion, a higher tendency to rupture at smaller diameters, and higher mortality following rupture. However, simply repairing AAAs at smaller diameters in women is a debatable solution, as even elective endovascular AAA repair is fraught with higher morbidity and mortality in women compared to men. The goal of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the effect of gender on AAA presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Additionally, we aim to review current controversies over screening recommendations and threshold for repair in women.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this anatomic study was to describe the cutaneous vascularization of the femoral triangle and its variation to evaluate the potential consequences of the classic incisions used in vascular surgery. The ultimate goal was to suggest surgical approaches that would take into account the vascularization of the inguinal region to potentially reduce the vascular lesions and wound complications at the groin.\nThe cutaneous arteries of the femoral triangle were studied in 11 lower limbs from 6 human embalmed cadavers. The technique included embalming of the cadavers, radiopaque latex injection, radiographs, and anatomic dissection.\nThe comparison of the vascular patterns revealed that despite the high variability of the arborization of the cutaneous arteries, their distribution patterns share many characteristics. The main vascularization of the femoral triangle comes from three arteries: the superficial circumflex iliac, the superficial epigastric, and the external pudendal. The first two arteries originate generally through a common trunk that buds laterally from the femoral artery at about 1.5\u00a0cm below the inguinal ligament. This study shows that the classic vertical incision at the groin would lead to damage of the cutaneous branches that cross over the femoral artery in its proximal part (the superficial epigastric artery in 82% and the common trunk of the superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries in 18%); these lesions could lead to the postsurgical disruption of the dermal blood flow.\nThe classic incisions could disrupt the cutaneous blood supply and thus increase the risk of tissue necrosis around the wound, explaining the observed postsurgical complications and infections. We propose to lower the vertical incision to start 2\u00a0cm under the inguinal ligament to reduce lesions of the cutaneous arteries and the potential devascularization of the wounds.",

    "abstract": "Successful cannulation is an important prerequisite for a functional arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Reasons for unsuccessful cannulation of an AVF are multifactorial and poorly evaluated. In our experience, a needle access segment (NAS) with a length of 10\u00a0cm,\u00a0<5\u00a0mm deep from the skin surface, and >6\u00a0mm diameter assessed objectively using duplex Doppler ultrasound (DDUS) imaging, in a fistula with brachial artery flow >500\u00a0mL/min, permits consistent cannulation. This report provides observational data on the NAS of the outflow veins after fistula creation and a detailed long-term outcome on AVFs that needed superficialization of the NAS using minimal incision superficialization technique (MIST) to make them suitable for cannulation. This report is based on prospectively collected data with a longitudinal follow-up in a large patient cohort.\nA prospective database was used to analyze consecutive patients undergoing AVF until the study end point. All patients underwent a protocol-based maturation evaluation using color DDUS imaging. Unsuitable NAS were surgically corrected using superficialization (by MIST or lipectomy) of deeply situated veins or NAS reconstruction.\nBetween February 1, 2007, and May 31, 2013, 617 new AVF surgeries were performed. Outflow vein superficialization (MIST or lipectomy) or NAS reconstruction was necessary in 226 of 585 procedures (38.6%) included in this analysis. Of these, 162 (72%) were performed using MIST, 50 (22%) with a single long incision, and 14 (6%) using lipectomy technique. Technical success for MIST was 100%, and only two fistulae failed to mature. The vein depth of 9.2\u00a0\u00b1 3.2\u00a0mm during initial vessel mapping was similar to the pre-MIST depth of 9.1\u00a0\u00b1 3.8\u00a0mm. Depth of NAS improved to 3.1\u00a0\u00b1 1.0\u00a0mm after MIST. The secondary patency after MIST at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 60\u00a0months was 98%, 93.3%, 88.1%, 83.3%, and 80.9%. During the 400.8 post-MIST functional fistula-years, only 0.63 procedures per year were required to maintain AVF patency.\nOur data suggest that maturation of AVFs using objective criteria based on DDUS provides an opportunity to identify NAS problems in outflow veins before cannulation. Most of the of the AVF outflow veins (71.7%) could be transposed or superficialized using MIST, with excellent long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The International Society for Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) broadly categorizes vascular anomalies into vascular tumors and vascular malformations. Vascular malformations are further divided based on their flow properties into slow-flow venous and lymphatic malformations, high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and congenital mixed syndromes, which can include combinations thereof. Whether occurring in isolation or as part of a broader syndrome, congenital high-flow AVMs are arguably the most complicated, challenging, and gratifying of all vascular malformations to diagnose and manage. Various configurations exist depending on location and coexisting clinical features. Transcatheter embolization has evolved into the mainstay of treatment for most congenital peripheral AVMs with surgical excision playing a growingly limited role as an adjunctive modality. Successful treatment requires technical precision, creativity, patience, and persistence given the ever-evolving angioarchitecture and hemodynamic profile of these lesions. Despite these challenges, certain fundamental principles have been established as our understanding of the pathogenesis, natural history, hemodynamics, and treatment outcomes has expanded and evolved over the last few decades. These principles are crucial to adhere to in the overall management of these lesions and are highlighted and expanded upon herein.",

    "abstract": "Fundamental skills testing is now required for certification in general surgery. No model for assessing fundamental endovascular skills exists. Our objective was to develop a model that tests the fundamental endovascular skills and differentiates competent from noncompetent performance.\nThe Fundamentals of Endovascular Surgery model was developed in silicon and virtual-reality versions. Twenty individuals (with a range of experience) performed four tasks on each model in three separate sessions. Tasks on the silicon model were performed under fluoroscopic guidance, and electromagnetic tracking captured motion metrics for catheter tip position. Image processing captured tool tip position and motion on the virtual model. Performance was evaluated using a global rating scale, blinded video assessment of error metrics, and catheter tip movement and position. Motion analysis was based on derivations of speed and position that define proficiency of movement (spectral arc length, duration of submovement, and number of submovements).\nPerformance was significantly different between competent and noncompetent interventionalists for the three performance measures of motion metrics, error metrics, and global rating scale. The mean error metric score was 6.83 for noncompetent individuals and 2.51 for the competent group (P < .0001). Median global rating scores were 2.25 for the noncompetent group and 4.75 for the competent users (P < .0001).\nThe Fundamentals of Endovascular Surgery model successfully differentiates competent and noncompetent performance of fundamental endovascular skills based on a series of objective performance measures. This model could serve as a platform for skills testing for all trainees.",

    "abstract": "Dr C. Autious has just returned from the most prestigious vascular surgery meeting in America. At the meeting, one of the most prominent complex aneurysm surgeons arose to discuss a paper concerning a procedure he had developed and popularized over the last decade. Dr L. Uminous stunned the audience with his declaration that he no longer recommends that his namesake procedure be performed. Instead, he proclaimed that a new, radically different procedure be adopted immediately. He showed slides detailing the novel proposal but did not give data concerning results obtained. The recommended procedure is technically possible but seems to require a different skill set. Dr Autious has a patient scheduled for elective surgery that he had planned to use the Uminous procedure to treat. What should he do? A. Do the recommended procedure as best you can. B. Refer the patient to Dr Uminous. C. Offer the recommended procedure with full disclosure. D. Give full disclosure and let the patient decide which procedure to use. E. Put the procedure on hold until more information becomes available.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been shown to predict postoperative renal complications and mortality after open aortic surgery; the impact of postoperative renal complications less severe than permanent dialysis are unknown. We evaluated the impact of postoperative renal dysfunction severity on survival using a regional quality improvement registry.\nPatients undergoing intact open aortic reconstruction in the Vascular Study Group of New England registry (2003-2012) were stratified by severity of postoperative renal complications; none, creatinine increase of greater than 0.5 mg/dL (incCr), or any hemodialysis (HD). Predictors of renal dysfunction and impact of renal complications on survival were analyzed using multivariable methods.\nWe included 2695 patients, of which 65% (n = 1733) underwent open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 35% (n = 962) open aortoiliac reconstruction. At baseline, 15% of patients had preoperative moderate CKD and 1.2% had severe CKD. Postoperative renal complications of incCr occurred in 8.5% of patients, and 1.5% required HD. Multivariable cumlogit regression identified severe baseline CKD (odds ratio [OR], 15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4-34; P < .001, moderate CKD (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9-3.3; P < .001), suprarenal clamp use (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9; P < .001), perioperative vasopressor requirements (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9; P < .001), operating time (OR, 1.004 per minute; 95% CI, 1.003-1.006; P < .001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P < .001) as independent predictors of worsening strata of postoperative renal dysfunction. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that patient age (OR, 1.06 per year; 95% CI, 1.01-1.1; P = .01), baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2; P < .01), incCr (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8-7.4; P = .009), and HD (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.8-12.7); P = .009) independently increased 30-day mortality. Risk-adjusted multivariable Cox regression showed that incCr (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6; P < .001) and HD (hazard ratio, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.8-6.9; P < .001) increased risk of late death independent of a variety of other clinical variables, including baseline CKD. The 5-year survival was lower (log-rank P < .001) in patients with incCr (66% \u00b1 4%), and HD (38% \u00b1 10%) compared with those with no renal complications (77% \u00b1 1%).\nIncreasing severity of postoperative renal dysfunction independently predicts increased risk of late mortality after open aortic surgery. Perioperative measures to decrease renal complications may potentially prolong the survival of patients after open aortic surgery.",

Multivariable cumlogit regression identified severe baseline CKD (odds ratio [OR], 15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4-34; P < .001, moderate CKD (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9-3.3; P < .001), suprarenal clamp use (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9; P < .001), perioperative vasopressor requirements (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9; P < .001), operating time (OR, 1.004 per minute; 95% CI, 1.003-1.006; P < .001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P < .001) as independent predictors of worsening strata of postoperative renal dysfunction. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that patient age (OR, 1.06 per year; 95% CI, 1.01-1.1; P = .01), baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2; P < .01), incCr (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8-7.4; P = .009), and HD (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.8-12.7); P = .009) independently increased 30-day mortality. Risk-adjusted multivariable Cox regression showed that incCr (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6; P < .001) and HD (hazard ratio, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.8-6.9; P < .001) increased risk of late death independent of a variety of other clinical variables, including baseline CKD. The 5-year survival was lower (log-rank P < .001) in patients with incCr (66% \u00b1 4%), and HD (38% \u00b1 10%) compared with those with no renal complications (77% \u00b1 1%).",

    "abstract": "The Veterans Affairs Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) Trial of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms study was a randomized controlled trial comparing open vs endovascular repair (EVAR) in standard-risk patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms. The analysis reported here identifies characteristics, risk factors, and long-term outcome of endoleaks in patients treated with EVAR in the OVER cohort.\nThe OVER trial enrolled 881 patients, of whom 439 received successful EVAR. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for endoleaks and secondary interventions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, longitudinal plots, and generalized linear mixed models methods were used to describe time to endoleak detection, resolution, or death.\nDuring a mean follow-up of 6.2 \u00b1 2.4 years, 135 patients (30.5%) developed 187 endoleaks. Four patients with EVAR went on to rupture; these four patients did not all have an endoleak. Mortality between patients who did and did not develop endoleaks was not significantly different. The 187 endoleaks included 12% type I, 76% type II, 3% type III, 3% type IV, and 6% indeterminate. Patient demographics and vascular risk factors were not associated with endoleak development. The presence of endoleaks resulted in an increase in aneurysm diameter over time (P < .0001). Fifty-three percent of endoleaks resolved spontaneously, and 31.9% received secondary interventions. The initial aneurysm size independently predicted a need for secondary interventions (P < .0003). Delayed type II endoleaks (detected >1 year after EVAR) were associated with aneurysm enlargement compared with the early counterpart. There was no difference in aneurysm size or length of survival between type II and other types of endoleak.\nWe present one of the most comprehensive and longest follow-up analyses of patients treated with aortic endografts. Endoleaks were common and negatively affected aneurysm diameter reduction. Delayed type II endoleaks were associated with late aneurysm diameter enlargement. Endoleaks and aneurysm diameter enlargement were not associated with excess mortality compared with those without these features.",

However, their relationship with cerebral atherosclerosis (CA) has not been investigated extensively. We aim to study the relationship between CA severity and EPC subpopulations levels.\nWe enrolled 197 patients in this study. EPCs were measured by flow cytometry. Digital subtraction angiography was used to assess CA. Arterial lesion severity was evaluated among cerebral arteries which showed steno-occlusion change and the extent of that condition.\nThere was a significant inverse correlation between EPCs level and CA prevalence after adjusting for confounders (CD45(-/dim)CD34(+)CD309(+) cells: odds ratio [OR], 0.110; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.026-0.475; P = .00; CD45(-/dim)CD133(+)CD309(+) cells: OR, 0.134; 95% CI, 0.030-0.599; P = .01; CD45(-/dim) CD34(+)CD133(+)CD309(+) cells: OR, 0.010; 95% CI, 0.001-0 .541, P = .02).

    "abstract": "Continuous suturing techniques have conventionally been used for the end-to-side anastomoses of radiocephalic fistulas (RCFs); however, primary patency rates are poor. Only 50% to 60% of RCFs ever achieve functional patency. We hypothesized that a hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique (as used in many microsurgical procedures) may improve outcomes in fistulas constructed from small vessels.\nA randomized controlled trial comparing hybrid interrupted-continuous (n = 42) with continuous (n = 36) suturing techniques for RCF was undertaken. Patients were excluded if vessels were <1.8 mm in diameter or if previous ipsilateral fistula had been attempted. A priori power calculation indicated that a sample size of 78 patients was required to detect an improvement in patency from 50% to 80% (\u03b1 = .05, \u03b2 = .8). The primary end point was primary patency at 6 weeks (assessed by a blinded observer for the presence of thrill and bruit). Secondary end points were immediate patency, functional patency (assessed clinically and by ultrasound) at 6 weeks, and presence of anastomotic stenosis.\nGroups were comparable for basic patient demographics, operating surgeon, and vessel diameter as measured on preoperative ultrasound (mean age, 58.9 \u00b1 13 years; 68% male). Primary patency at 6 weeks was higher in the hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique group (71% vs 47%; P = .01). Immediate patency was also higher in the hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique group (93% vs 67%; P < .001). There was no significant difference in functional patency at 6 weeks (52% vs 36%; P = .18). Three patients developed an anastomotic stenosis. All were in the hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique group. One patient from the interrupted suturing technique cohort required re-exploration for bleeding.\nA hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique yielded higher immediate and 6-week primary patency rates for RCF. The hybrid interrupted-continuous suturing technique may improve anastomotic compliance and reduce the narrowing and puckering that can occur on suture tightening in small-caliber vessels. Based on these findings, consideration should be given to performing hybrid interrupted-continuous anastomoses for RCFs.",

    "abstract": "Stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) may be required to achieve an adequate landing zone in up to 40% of descending thoracic aneurysms (DTAs). The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) consists of a main stent graft and a branch stent graft designed to maintain LSA patency while diverting circulation through the encroaching aneurysm. Participating in the United States Food and Drug Administration's new Innovation Pathway, this first-in-human, early feasibility study evaluates early clinical experience of the Valiant Mona LSA Stent Graft System in patients with DTAs where the proximal landing zone necessitates LSA coverage.\nThis premarket, nonrandomized, single-arm prospective study recruited nine patients (age 72.9 \u00b1 7.6 years). Primary end points were aneurysm-related mortality, stroke, paraplegia, left arm/hand ischemia, and treatment success. Neurologic events were assessed by imaging and by independent neurologists. Inclusion criteria required patients with a DTA or penetrating aortic ulcer to have a distance of \u226510 mm between the left common carotid artery and the LSA. Mean aneurysm diameter was 53.7 \u00b1 10.0 mm. The indication for repair was for saccular DTA in five patients or fusiform DTA in four. Seven patients were at American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification III/IV.\nAll nine patients received one main stent graft (diameter 28 to 42 mm) and one branch stent graft (diameter 10 to 14 mm). To extend device coverage distally, a commercial Valiant Captivia device was implanted in seven patients. No uncorrected endoleaks were observed at the end of the implant procedure. Four endoleaks developed before discharge in four of eight evaluable patients. Two were identified as type II and two were of undetermined type. No endoleak resulted in a secondary intervention. Technical success, defined by the clinical investigational plan, was achieved in all nine patients intraoperatively, and treatment success was achieved in all eight evaluable patients at 1 month. There were no major, disabling strokes. Four minor nondisabling strokes were reported in three patients \u226430 days (days 1, 1, 5, and 24). To date, there have been no reports of death, left arm ischemia, paraplegia, rupture, conversion to open surgery, or secondary endovascular procedure. No patients required surgical LSA revascularization.\nThe Valiant Mona LSA system demonstrates technical and treatment success, relative safety, and early durability in its initial use in DTA patients. Midterm results are expected as patients are monitored at regular intervals to 5 years.",

All retrieved articles published before December 31, 2014 (and in English) primarily describing the creation of hemodialysis vascular access for elderly patients were considered for inclusion. We report pooled AVF patency rates and a comparison of radiocephalic vs brachiocephalic AVF patency rates using odds ratios (ORs).\nOf 199 relevant articles reviewed, 15 were deemed eligible for the review. The pooled 12-month primary and secondary AVF patency rates were 53.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.3-59.9) and 71.6% (95% CI, 59.2-82.7), respectively. Comparison of radiocephalic vs brachiocephalic AVF patency rates demonstrated that radiocephalic AVFs have inferior primary (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93; P = .01) and secondary (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00; P = .05) patency rates.\nThis meta-analysis confirms that adequate 12-month primary and secondary AVF patency rates can be achieved in elderly patients. Brachiocephalic AVFs have both superior primary and secondary patency rates at 12 months compared with radiocephalic AVFs. These important data can inform clinicians' and patients' decision-making about suitability of attempting AVF formation in older persons.",

    "abstract": "Wound severity is assessed mainly by the Rutherford classification for critical limb ischemia (CLI) with tissue loss. The Rutherford classification is based on the extent of tissue loss; however, its classification criteria are ambiguous and do not include information regarding wound depth. We investigated the effects of wound depth on clinical outcomes in CLI with tissue loss after endovascular treatment (EVT).\nBetween April 2007 and August 2013, we enrolled 210 consecutive patients (247 limbs) who received EVT for CLI with tissue loss. In the limbs examined, 271 individual wounds existed. We evaluated wound depth using the University of Texas grade (grade 1: superficial wound not involving the tendon, capsule, or bone, n = 97; grade 2: wound penetrating the tendon or capsule, n = 124; and grade 3: wound penetrating the bone or joint, n = 50). We also investigated the wound healing rate at 12 months and limb salvage and major amputation-free survival rates 3 years after EVT.\nThe wound healing rates at 12 months in Texas 1, 2, and 3 were 88%, 48%, and 24%, respectively (log-rank P < .001). The limb salvage and major amputation-free survival rates at 3 years were lower in deep wounds than in shallow wounds (limb salvage rates: 98%, 82%, and 67%, respectively; P < .001; major amputation-free survival rates: 78%, 52%, and 42%, respectively; P < .001). In only minor tissue loss, the wound healing rates at 12 months and the limb salvage and major amputation-free survival rates at 3 years were stratified according to wound depth (wound healing rates: 92% in Texas 1 and 51% in Texas 2 or 3; P < .001; limb salvage rates: 99% in Texas 1 and 86% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .001; major amputation-free survival rates: 79% in Texas 1 and 57% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .001). In only major tissue loss, deep wounds also caused poor outcomes compared with shallow wounds (wound healing rates: 70% in Texas 1 and 36% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .019; limb salvage rates: 94% in Texas 1 and 73% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .050; major amputation-free survival rates: 75% in Texas 1 and 45% in Texas 2 or 3; P = .039).\nWound depth is an important indicator of wound status and affects the clinical outcomes of CLI with tissue loss.",

    "abstract": "Carotid intervention shortly after an acute neurologic ischemic event is being performed more frequently in stroke centers to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is offered to select patients with ischemic stroke symptoms who present within 4.5 hours. However, there is a paucity of data as to whether tPA followed by urgent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) has an increased risk of complications, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We sought to determine the periprocedural complications of urgently performed CEA or CAS following tPA.\nFrom January 2009 to January 2015, 762 patients underwent carotid interventions (CEA, n = 440; CAS, n = 322) at a tertiary referral center and 165 patients (21.6%) underwent an urgent CEA or CAS during the index hospitalization for an acute transient ischemic attack or stroke. We compared the effect of intravenous tPA on 30-day complications, including ICH. The \u03c7(2) and Fisher exact tests were used to determine significance between groups.\nDuring the 6-year period, 165 patients underwent urgent carotid interventions (CEA, n = 135; CAS, n = 30) for acute neurologic symptoms. Of these, 19% (31 patients [CEA, n = 25; CAS, n = 6]) had tPA for an acute stroke; the remaining (134 patients [CEA, n = 110; CAS, n = 24]) fell outside of the tPA time window. Most strokes were minor or moderate with a mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 6.6 (range, 0-19). The mean time to intervention for both groups was 2.4 days (0-15 days). The 30-day stroke, death, and myocardial infarction rates were 9.7% (3 of 31) for the tPA group compared with 4.5% (6 of 134) for the no-tPA group (P = .37). Including bleeding complications in these 30-day outcomes, there was no difference between the tPA (3 of 31) and the no-tPA cohorts (8 of 134; P = .43). In the tPA group, there were one ICH, one neck hematoma/death, and an additional death; in the no-tPA group, there were one ICH, two neck hematomas, one stroke, two myocardial infarctions, one ICH/death, and one additional death. No significant increased rates of bleeding were noted within the tPA group (2 of 31) compared with the no-tPA group (4 of 134; P = .32). Moreover, in the tPA cohort, more than half of the patients (17 of 31) underwent revascularization within 72 hours (CEA = 13; CAS = 4) with outcomes similar to those who underwent revascularization after 72 hours.\nThrombolysis followed by urgent CEA or CAS is not associated with an increased risk of complications in select patients who present with acute neurologic symptoms. Selection of patients is important; there was no ICH and only one death in each group for patients with minor to moderate ischemic stroke (NIHSS score <10).",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, primary endoluminal therapy for critical limb ischemia (CLI), assessed as rest pain and tissue loss of the lower extremity, has significantly increased. Reporting of patient-centered outcomes using the new Society for Vascular Surgery objective performance goals (OPGs) has been limited. This study examined the OPGs for infrainguinal endovascular management of CLI.\nA prospective database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the lower extremity for CLI between 2000 and 2011 was queried. Evaluated were clinical efficacy (absence of recurrent symptoms, maintenance of ambulation and absence of major amputation), amputation-free survival (survival without major amputation), and freedom from major adverse limb events (MALEs; above-ankle amputation of the index limb or major reintervention - new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision).\nA total of 728 patients (60% male; age, 68 \u00b1 14 years) underwent lower extremity interventions for CLI (66% tissue loss); of these, 39% had superficial femoral artery and tibial interventions. Diabetes mellitus was present in 71%, hyperlipidemia in 64%, and chronic renal insufficiency in 37%. Technical success was 96%. The overall rate at 30 days of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) was 3% and MALEs was 12%. At 5 years, clinical efficacy was (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean) 42% \u00b1 5%, amputation-free survival was 41% \u00b1 7%, and freedom from MALEs was 51% \u00b1 4%. Clinical efficacy was significantly different in those presenting with rest pain and tissue loss and in the anatomic high-risk group compared with the clinical high-risk group, and both were worse compared with the group without clinical or high-risk criteria.\nEndoluminal therapy for CLI is associated with early low MACE rates but high MALE rates. When the key outcome of amputation free survival is considered, predictors of a better outcome were absence of current smoking, a lower modified Edifoligide for the Prevention of Infrainguinal Vein Graft Failure (PREVENT III) amputation risk score, better preoperative ambulation status, lower MACEs, and discharge disposition to home. The presence of tissue loss and anatomic risk factors negatively affect outcomes. Longer-term outcomes after endovascular intervention for CLI remain relatively poor, with <40% success in objective performance outcomes at 5 years.",

No differences in mortality with respect to OAR or EVAR were found between the female and male cohorts in either intact or ruptured AAAs.\nWomen with AAAs are older and have a higher frequency of cardiovascular risk factors than men. Women rupture AAAs with a greater frequency than men at all size intervals and have a fourfold increased frequency of rupture at <5.5 cm. No differences in surgical mortality between women and men were found. Current practice guidelines for elective AAA operative intervention should be reconsidered and stratified by gender.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Because most patients with CLI will eventually undergo some type of revascularization, the natural history of CLI is not well defined, although it is important to know when patients decide to pursue treatment.\nWe systematically searched multiple databases for controlled and uncontrolled studies of patients with CLI who did not receive revascularization with a minimum follow-up of \u22651 year. Predefined outcomes of interest were mortality, major amputation, and wound healing. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool cumulative incidence across studies.\nWe identified 13 studies enrolling 1527 patients. During a median follow-up of 12 months, all-cause mortality rate was 22% (confidence interval [CI], 12%-33%) and major amputation rate was 22% (CI, 2%-42%). Worsened wound or ulcer was found at 35% (CI, 10%-62%). There was a trend toward improvement in mortality and amputation rate in studies done after 1997. The quality of evidence was low because of increased risk of bias and inconsistency.\nMortality and major amputations are common in patients who have untreated CLI during a median follow-up of 1 year, although these outcomes have improved in recent times.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to report 30-day results from a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith Alpha thoracic endovascular graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) for treatment of blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs).\nEligible patients with BTAIs (grade II to grade IV) in the descending thoracic aorta were treated with the Zenith Alpha device, which is available in smaller graft diameters (starting at 18 mm) and lower profile delivery systems (starting at 16F) than currently available thoracic endografts. The device (nitinol stents and polyester graft material) accommodates a tighter aortic curvature (radius of 20 mm) than the predicate Zenith TX2 Pro-Form. Follow-up clinical and imaging evaluations were performed at 30 days, at 6 and 12 months, and annually thereafter through 5 years. The primary end point was 30-day mortality.\nBetween January 2013 and May 2014, 50 patients (44 men; mean age, 43 \u00b1 19 years; range, 18-89 years) were treated with the Zenith Alpha device at 17 U.S. sites. The mean Injury Severity Score was 31 \u00b1 14 (range, 3-66). Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients, with 0% intraoperative mortality. Device access was entirely percutaneous in 22 patients (44%). Smaller size grafts (18-24 mm) were used in 15 patients (30%). The mean procedure time was 85 \u00b1 44 minutes (range, 34-278 minutes), and mean blood loss was 103 \u00b1 145 mL (range, 0-1000 mL). The 30-day mortality rate was 2%; one patient died 24 days after the procedure of respiratory failure related to associated injuries and not to the device or procedure as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). One patient experienced a stroke 7 days after the procedure (cause undetermined by the CEC), and one patient underwent reintervention for a site-reported proximal type I endoleak (core laboratory reported unknown endoleak type) at 30 days after the procedure. There have been no conversions to open surgical repair, paraplegia, or aortic rupture within 30 days.\nShort-term results indicate that the Zenith Alpha thoracic endovascular graft appears safe and effective for the treatment of BTAIs. This low-profile device enables complete percutaneous repair in a large percentage of patients and can achieve high rates of technical success and very low rates of aortic injury-related mortality within 30 days.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to present open surgical conversion with graft salvage or \"semiconversion\" as a definitive and safe treatment for untreatable and persistent type II endoleaks causing sac enlargement after endovascular aneurysm repair.\nBetween January 2001 and December 2014, 25 of 1623 endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) patients were selected as candidates for open semiconversion. The indication was persistent type II endoleak in 13 patients (12 of whom received previous attempts of embolization), type I and II endoleak in 2 patients, and sac growth without imaging evidence of endoleak in the other 10. After the infrarenal aorta was prepared (via a retroperitoneal access, whenever possible), the technique consisted of performing a banding of the neck with Teflon (DuPont, Wilmington, Del), a sacotomy to remove the thrombus or the hygroma, or both, and then suturing all of the feeding vessels that were found. Proximal and distal fenestrations were performed to avoid sac repressurization.\nThe semiconversion was performed after a mean of 74 months after the initial EVAR. The mean aneurysm size at the time of the EVAR was 6.0 cm (range, 5.0-9.5 cm), and the mean aneurysm size at the time of the semiconversion was 7.7 cm (range, 5.5-11.5 cm). The overall aneurysm size increase was 38%, and the average growth rate was 8.2% per year. One patient had a stable aneurysm size but was treated because of an emergency condition. Technical success was 100%, with resolution of the endoleak and no perioperative deaths. Four cardiac deaths were registered at 12, 26, 30, and 60 months (mean follow-up, 42 months; range, 1-80 months).\nGraft salvage appears to be a valid option compared with open repair when considering treatment of persistent type II endoleak. This case series shows that semiconversion is a safe and effective treatment for otherwise untreatable type II endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about acute peripheral arterial thrombosis in patients with concomitant cancer. Small studies suggest that revascularization in this patient group is associated with thrombosis and increased risk of amputation and death. We investigated the frequency of cancer in patients operated on for acute peripheral arterial thrombosis and the long-term risk of amputation, mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in a national cohort.\nThis was a prospective case/noncase study comprising all Danish citizens undergoing vascular surgery for acute arterial thrombosis from 1986 to 2012 with up to 26 years of follow-up.\nA total of 7840 patients were treated surgically for acute arterial thrombosis; 2384 (30.4%) were previously diagnosed with cancer or developed cancer during the observation period. Risk of amputation was not significantly different in patients with or without cancer, except in patients with cancer diagnosed <24 months before acute limb ischemia (hazard ratio, 2.0). Mortality was significantly greater in all patients having or developing cancer within 24 months after surgery (hazard ratio, 1.2-2.2). The frequencies of myocardial infarction and stroke were similar to those among patients without cancer.\nOne of five patients operated on for acute limb ischemia has a diagnosis of cancer, and a further 3.4% will develop cancer within 24 months. The data further show that patients with acute limb ischemia and concomitant cancer can be successfully revascularized and that the majority of these patients preserve their limb. Cancer should therefore not contravene interventional treatment.",

    "abstract": "Current guidelines suggest that arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is associated with survival advantage over arteriovenous graft (AVG). However, AVFs often require months to become functional, increasing tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) use, which can erode the benefit of an AVF. We sought to compare survival in patients with end-stage renal disease after creation of an AVF or AVG in patients starting hemodialysis (HD) with a TDC and to identify patient populations that may benefit from preferential use of AVG over AVF.\nUsing U.S. Renal Data System databases, we identified incident HD patients in 2005 through 2008 and observed them through 2008. Initial access type and clinical variables including albumin levels were assessed using U.S. Renal Data System data collection forms. Attempts at AVF and AVG creation in patients who started HD through a TDC were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes. We accounted for the effect of changes in access type by truncating follow-up when an additional AVF or AVG was performed. Survival curves were then constructed, and log-rank tests were used for pairwise survival comparisons, stratified by age. Multivariate analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazards regressions; variables were chosen using stepwise elimination. An interaction of access type and albumin level was detected, and Cox models using differing thresholds for albumin level were constructed. The primary outcome was survival.\nAmong the 138,245 patients who started with a TDC and had complete records amenable for analysis, 22.8% underwent AVF creation (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 68.9 \u00b1 12.5 years; 27.8% mortality at 1 year) and 7.6% underwent AVG placement (70.2 \u00b1 12.0 years; 28.2% mortality) within 3 months of HD initiation; 69.6% remained with a TDC (63.2 \u00b1 15.4 years; 33.8% mortality). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, AVF creation is equivalent to AVG placement in terms of survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-1.02; P = .349). AVG placement is superior to continued TDC use (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.48-1.61; P < .001). In patients older than 80 years with albumin levels >4.0 g/dL, AVF creation is associated with higher mortality hazard compared with AVG creation (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43; P = .013).\nFor patients who start HD through a TDC, placement of an AVF and AVG is associated with similar mortality hazard. Further study is necessary to determine the ideal access for patients in whom the survival advantage of an AVF over an AVG is uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous endovascular aortic repair (PEVAR) has been increasingly used to treat infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms, but few studies have evaluated the results in complex aortic aneurysms. We reviewed the technical success and clinical outcomes of PEVAR using large-diameter sheaths for the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms with thoracic, fenestrated, and branched stent grafts.\nThe clinical data of patients who underwent total PEVAR for descending thoracic aneurysm, thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, pararenal, and aortoiliac aneurysms using thoracic, fenestrated, and branched stent grafts between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed. Repairs with fenestrated-branched stent grafts were performed using commercially available or investigational devices under a physician-sponsored investigational device protocols. Percutaneous closure was performed using ultrasound guidance and two Perclose devices (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara Calif) per femoral puncture site. End points were technical success, access-related complications, morbidity, and mortality.\nThere were 102 patients, 77 male and 25 female, with a mean age of 75 \u00b1 8 years. Aneurysm extent was pararenal in 48 patients (47%), thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in 27 (26%), descending thoracic aneurysm in 19 (19%), and aortoiliac in 8 (8%). Fenestrated or branched endografts, or both, were placed in 72 patients (71%). Total percutaneous closure was performed in 170 femoral arteries using \u226520F-diameter sheaths in 163 (96%). Technical success was obtained in 161 femoral arteries (95%). There were no factors associated with technical failure. Access-related complications occurred in five patients (5%), including femoral artery thrombosis in three (3%), and retroperitoneal hematoma or pseudoaneurysm in one patient each (1%). There were no 30-day deaths. Freedom from access-related complications was 97% \u00b1 1% at 30 days and 1 year. No access-related complications occurred >30 days.\nTotal percutaneous technique can be safely performed with a high technical success rate and low rate of access complications in patients with thoracic and complex aortic disease requiring large-diameter sheaths. The rate of access-related complications (5%) is similar to that reported for PEVAR of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms using smaller-profile devices.",

    "abstract": "Long-term results of the posterior approach (PA) for the treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms are lacking in the literature. We reviewed our experience during a 13-year period in patients with popliteal artery aneurysms, comparing those treated through a PA with those operated on through a standard medial approach (MA).\nClinical data of all patients treated between February 1998 and October 2011 were retrospectively reviewed and outcomes analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and \u03c7(2), Wilcoxon, and log-rank tests were used for analysis.\nA total of 77 aneurysms were treated in 65 patients (64 men). Mean age was 68 years (range, 48-96 years). Thirty-six aneurysms were asymptomatic (47%). Mean sac diameter was 2.8 \u00b1 1 cm. A PA was used in 43 PAAs (55%) and an MA in 34. The PA and MA patients differed significantly in age (median being older), smoking history (more frequent in PA), and renal insufficiency and cerebrovascular disease (higher for MA). In 42 cases the aneurysm was symptomatic (54.5%) for chronic limb ischemia, with intermittent claudication in 18 patients, acute ischemia in 17, blue toe syndrome in 3, compression on adjacent structures in 3, and rupture with severe acute pain in 1. All PA repairs consisted of aneurysmectomy with an interposition graft with end-to-end anastomoses; among MA repairs, 22 interposition grafts and 12 bypasses were performed. A polytetrafluoroethylene graft was used in 54 cases. Five patients had an early thrombosis (two PA and three MA). No perioperative deaths occurred. Two patients sustained a permanent (PA) and a temporary (MA) peroneal nerve lesion. There were no early amputations. The median in-hospital stay was longer for MA (10 days) than for PA (7 days; P = .02). Median follow-up was 58.8 months (range, 5 days-166 months). Nine patients died during follow-up of unrelated causes. The 5-year primary and secondary patency rates were 59.6% \u00b1 8.6% and 96.5% \u00b1 3.4%, respectively, for PA, and 65.1% \u00b1 11.1% and 79.4% \u00b1 9.7%, respectively, for MA (P = .53 for primary patency rate and P = .22 for secondary patency rate). Limb salvage was 100% at 5 years and 93.3% \u00b1 6.4% at 10 years for PA and 91.1% \u00b1 6.3% at both time points for MA (P = .28).\nPA and MA both achieved satisfactory results in primary and secondary patency rates, as well as limb salvage, during long-term follow-up. The differences between the two groups were small and not statistically significant. PA was burdened by similar postoperative nerve and wound complications compared with MA. The in-hospital stay after PA was significantly lower.",

Procedural details, 30-day morbidity and mortality rates, and cost of hospitalization were analyzed. Nonparametric bootstrap analysis was used to compare means between groups and calculate confidence intervals (CIs).\nThere were 84 consecutive fEVAR (n = 61) and bEVAR (n = 23) procedures. The 30-day mortality was 3.3% for fEVAR and 4.3% for bEVAR. Mean hospital stay was 7.2 \u00b1 0.8 days for fEVAR and 12.6 \u00b1 2.2 days for bEVAR. The mean cost of the index hospitalization was $57,000 for fEVAR and $91,000 for bEVAR. Device-related costs accounted for 55% of the total costs. The occurrence of intraoperative or postoperative events were used to further divide each of the fEVAR and bEVAR groups into \"complicated hospitalization\" (fEVAR, n = 10; bEVAR, n = 13) and \"uncomplicated hospitalization\" (fEVAR, n = 51; bEVAR, n = 10) groups. Device-related costs were not significantly different between the complicated and uncomplicated hospitalization groups (mean difference [95% CI] fEVAR: $3383 [-$3405 to $9809], P = .3; and bEVAR: $1930 [-$7892 to $11,288], P = .68). However, there were significant differences between the complicated and uncomplicated hospitalization groups in hospital length of stay (mean difference [95% CI] fEVAR: 8.1 [3.0-13.2] days, P = .001; and bEVAR: 10.8 [5.9-19.9] days, P = .002) and nondevice-related costs (mean difference [95% CI,] fEVAR: $25,843 [$11,689-$43,247], P = .001; and bEVAR; $20,326 [$9362-$36,615], P = .002).\nbEVAR and fEVAR are expensive interventions. Intraoperative adverse events and postoperative systemic complications dramatically increase costs and length of stay. Measures to minimize complications will reduce hospitalization costs and improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a commonly performed vascular operation. Yet, postoperative length of stay (LOS) varies greatly, even within institutions. The present study reviewed the morbidity, mortality, and the financial effect of increased LOS to establish modifiable factors associated with prolonged hospital LOS, with the goal of improving quality.\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database was used to identify all patients undergoing primary, elective EVAR at a single institution between January 1, 2011, and May 28, 2014. Preoperative patient characteristics, intraoperative details, postoperative factors, long-term outcomes, and cost data were reviewed using an Institutional Review Board-approved prospectively collected database. Multivariate analysis was used to determine statistical difference between patients with LOS \u22642 days and >2 days.\nComplete 30-day variable and cost data were available for 138 patients with an average follow-up of 12 months; of these, 46 (33%) had a LOS >2 days. Variables determined to be statistically significant predictors of prolonged LOS included aneurysm diameter (P = .03), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification score (P < .001), thromboembolectomy (P = .01), and increased postoperative cardiac (P < .001) and renal (P = .01) complications. Specifically, modifiable risk factors that contributed to increased LOS included performance of a concomitant procedure (P < .001), increased volume of iodinated contrast (P = .05), increased volume of intraoperative crystalloid (P = .05), placement in an intensive care unit (P < .001), return to the operating room (P < .001), and the use of vasoactive medications (P < .001). Hospital charges ($102,000 \u00b1 $41,000 vs $180,000 \u00b1 $73,000; P = .01) and costs ($27,000 \u00b1 $10,000 vs $45,000 \u00b1 $19,000 P = .01) were significantly higher in patients with prolonged LOS; however, there was no difference in physician charges ($8000 \u00b1 $5700 vs $12,000 \u00b1 $12,000; P = .09). Increased LOS after EVAR was associated with an increase in mortality at 1 month (0% vs 4% P = .05) and 12 months (3% vs 13% P = .03).\nThis study highlights several modifiable risk factors leading to increased LOS after EVAR, including performance of concomitant procedures, admission to the intensive care unit, and postoperative renal and cardiac complications. Further, increased LOS was associated with increased charges, costs, morbidity, and mortality after EVAR. This study highlights specific areas of focus for decreasing LOS after EVAR and, in turn, improving quality in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transcatheter embolization of splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) has been widely accepted as the first line of treatment in patients with symptoms, rupture, or large aneurysm size. Although embolization can usually be performed safely, ischemic complications, such as splenic infarct or abscess, occur in some patients. This study evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of endovascular SAA repair (ESAAR) using stent grafts, which may allow treatment while preserving flow to the spleen.\nWe reviewed the clinical data of all consecutive patients who underwent ESAAR using stent grafts. Brachial access was used except for patients with favorable angle of origin from the aorta. To overcome tortuosity and provide support, a coaxial system with a hydrophilic sheath was used. Low-profile 0.018-inch stent grafts were used for distal SAAs with a 10-mm to 15-mm length of proximal and distal segment of splenic artery measuring 4 to 11 mm in diameter. Follow-up included clinical examination and computed tomography imaging within 4 to 6 months after the procedure and yearly thereafter. End points were morbidity, stent graft patency, and freedom from endoleaks and reinterventions.\nESAAR was attempted in 10 patients, four males and six females, with median age of 64 years (range, 48-77 years). Median SAA size was 2.8 cm (range, 2-5.7 cm). Nine patients were asymptomatic, and one had pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding. The arterial access site was the brachial artery in six patients and the femoral artery in four. Two patients had brachial and femoral access to facilitate splenic artery stenting. Technical success of ESAAR using stent grafts was 80% (8 of 10). In two patients with distal SAAs, stent graft placement was not possible due to excessive vessel tortuosity, and treatment was by coil embolization. One patient developed brachial artery thrombosis, which was treated surgically. There were no ischemic complications in patients treated by ESAAR with stent grafts. Median length of stay was 1 day. One patient treated by coil embolization developed splenic infarct, which required readmission for pain control. Median follow-up was 9 months. Follow-up imaging in all successfully stented patients revealed patent stent grafts, no endoleak, and no aneurysm sac enlargement. No reinterventions were required.\nESAAR using self-expandable stent grafts offers a viable alternative to coil embolization in selected patients with SAAs. Distal SAAs with excessive vessel tortuosity may result in technical failure requiring embolization. Among patients who underwent successful ESAAR, there were no ischemic complications, stent graft occlusions, endoleaks, or sac enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for the aortic arch aneurysm is challenging because of its curved anatomic configuration and the presence of the supra-aortic branches. The Najuta fenestrated endograft (Kawasumi Laboratories, Inc, Tokyo, Japan) was developed to treat aortic arch diseases, offering maximal proximal landing length while preserving the blood flow to the supra-aortic branches. We evaluated the perioperative and midterm outcomes of this fenestrated endograft.\nBetween July 2007 and July 2013, 32 patients were treated with the Najuta endograft at three vascular centers. The mean age of the patients was 74.5 \u00b1 9.8 years (23 patients were men). Technical success, complication, overall survival rate, freedom from aneurysm-related death, secondary intervention, aneurysm enlargement, device migration, and patency of supra-aortic branches were investigated retrospectively.\nThe median follow-up period was 2.5 years (range, 0.2-6.2 years). Seventy-one supra-aortic vessels (30 brachiocephalic arteries, 31 left common carotid arteries, 10 left subclavian arteries) were planned to be preserved with fenestrations. Technical success rate was 91% (29 of 32; three type I endoleaks were seen), and five perioperative complications (two Stanford A dissections, one cerebral infarction, one celiac artery obstruction, one spinal cord ischemia) were recognized. Perioperative death was not observed. Overall survival rate and rate of freedom from aneurysm-related death at 3 years were 67% and 97%, respectively. The rate of freedom from secondary intervention and the rate of freedom from aneurysm enlargement at 3 years were 84% and 85%, respectively. Device migration was not observed. There were two branch (left carotid artery and left subclavian artery) occlusions at 2 weeks after TEVAR due to the endograft's infolding. No other branch occlusion was seen in this follow-up period. As a result, the patency rate of the supra-aortic branch was 97% at 3 years.\nThe perioperative and 3-year outcomes of TEVAR using the Najuta precurved, fenestrated endograft demonstrated high freedom from aneurysm enlargement and patency rates of the supra-aortic branches.",

Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms treated with fenestrated and branched grafts, even if including all four visceral vessels, were excluded. Patients who died within 30 days after the procedure were excluded from the analysis for SCI. All data were collected prospectively.\nA total of 218 patients (167 men; mean age, 68.8 \u00b1 7.5 years) were treated. Thirty-day mortality was 17 patients (7.8%). TAAA distribution among the 201 surviving patients was as follows: type I, n = 17 (8.5%); type II, n = 55 (27.4%); type III, n = 63 (31.3%); type IV, n = 54 (26.9%); and type V, n = 12 (5.9%). In the surviving patients, 21 (10.4%) developed perioperative SCI. At 30 days postoperatively, 13 (6.5%) of those patients had transient lower limb weakness, 5 patients (2.5%) had persistent lower limb weakness requiring assistance to stand or to walk, and 3 patients (1.5%) had persistent paraplegia. Five of the 21 patients awoke from anesthesia with a neurologic deficit. The remaining 16 patients had a later postoperative onset of SCI, with the majority of them (14 of 16) within 72 hours after the operation. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression identified operation time >300 minutes (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-21.1; P < .001), peripheral arterial disease (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2-21.9; P = .002), and baseline renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min; OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1-16.1; P = .04) as independent risk factors for SCI.\nIn our experience, most SCI events after endovascular TAAA repair are transient, with persistent paraplegia being rare. Patients with prolonged procedure duration, peripheral arterial disease, and baseline renal insufficiency appear to be at higher risk for development of SCI after endovascular TAAA repair.",

Five of the 21 patients awoke from anesthesia with a neurologic deficit. The remaining 16 patients had a later postoperative onset of SCI, with the majority of them (14 of 16) within 72 hours after the operation. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression identified operation time >300 minutes (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-21.1; P < .001), peripheral arterial disease (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2-21.9; P = .002), and baseline renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min; OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1-16.1; P = .04) as independent risk factors for SCI.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging for vein bypass graft (VBG) surveillance is confounded by technical and physiologic factors that reduce the sensitivity for detecting impending graft failure. In contrast, three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (CTA) offers high-fidelity anatomic characterization of VBGs, but its utility in detecting at risk grafts is unknown. The current study analyzed the correlation between DUS and CTA for detection of vein graft stenosis and evaluated the relationship of the observed abnormalities to VBG failure.\nConsecutive lower extremity VBG patients underwent surveillance with concurrent DUS imaging and CTA at 1 week and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. A standardized algorithm was used for CT reconstruction and extraction of the lumen geometries at 1-mm intervals. At each interval, CT-derived cross-sectional areas were coregistered and correlated to DUS peak systolic velocities (PSVs) within six predesignated anatomic zones and then analyzed for outcome association. Vein graft failure was defined as pathologic change within a given anatomic zone resulting in thrombosis, amputation, or reintervention within the 6-month period after the observed time point.\nThe study recruited 54 patients, and 10 (18%) experienced failure \u226418 months of implantation. The expected inverse relationship between cross-sectional area and PSV was only weakly correlated (Spearman rank coefficient = -0.19). Moderate elevations in the PSV ratio (PSVr; 2-3.5) were frequently transient, with 14 of 18 grafts (78%) demonstrating ratio reduction on subsequent imaging. A PSVr \u22653.5 was associated with a 67% failure rate. CT stenosis <50% was highly correlated with success (0 failures); however, high-grade (>80%) CT stenosis was more likely to succeed than to fail (25%). Significant discordance between CT and DUS was found in 18 patients. Although 14 of these patients had CT stenosis >70% with a PSVr <3.5, subsequent failure occurred in only two. Conversely, graft failure occurred in three of four patients with CT stenosis <70% but PSVr >3.5. Focused analysis of these patients using computational fluid dynamic modeling demonstrated that vein side branches, local tortuosity, regional diameter variations, and venovenostomies were the drivers of these discrepancies.\nThis analysis demonstrated that a PSVr \u22653.5 is strongly correlated with VBG failure, whereas the natural history of moderately elevated PSVr (2-3.5) is largely clinically benign. Although minimum stenosis on the CT scan was highly predictive of success, high-grade CT stenosis was infrequently associated with failure. The interaction of anatomic features with the local flow dynamics was identified as the primary confounder for a direct correlation between CT and DUS imaging.",

    "abstract": "The province of Saskatchewan presents unique challenges for the care of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), including variable access to health care resources and long transportation distances to tertiary vascular care. This study assessed the rates of ruptured and total AAA to determine regional variations within Saskatchewan and ascertain whether there are areas of high AAA prevalence that would possibly benefit from the implementation of a targeted screening program.\nAll diagnoses of AAA from 2001 to 2012 in the province of Saskatchewan were reviewed, with patients grouped by health region of residence. Diagnoses of ruptured and unruptured AAAs were obtained from the Saskatchewan Discharge Abstracts Database, Medical Services Billings Claims data, and Vital Statistics data.\nDuring the study period, 6163 AAAs were diagnosed. The provincial age-adjusted rate of AAA was 53.0/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 48.8-57.6). The highest age-adjusted rate of AAA was found in the Five Hills Health Region (FHHR), at 63.1/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 57.6-69.0), which was significantly higher than the provincial average (P\u00a0< .05).

    "abstract": "Although radial-cephalic (RC) and brachial-cephalic (BC) fistulas are the recommended primary accesses for hemodialysis, access failure is frequently due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis (JAS). Because increased turbulence at the anastomosis may lead to JAS, we hypothesized that an acute angle at the arteriovenous anastomosis is associated with JAS, reduced fistula patency, and increased reinterventions.\nBetween February 2013 and September 2014, the anastomotic angle and vessel diameters were prospectively collected for all patients who underwent RC or BC fistula creation. The primary end point was reintervention on the juxta-anastomotic segment. Secondary end points were primary and secondary patency of the fistula.\nA total of 149 patients (median age, 72 years) received 73 RC and 76 BC fistulas; the median follow-up was 7 months (range, 1-22 months) for RC and 12 months (range, 2-24 months) for BC fistulas. The median anastomotic angle in RC fistulas, was 30\u00b0. Anastomotic angles of <30\u00b0 were associated with reduced primary patency (38% vs 66%, P = .003) and secondary patency (84% vs 97%, P = .02) and increased numbers of reinterventions (67% vs 34%, P = .001). Cox analysis showed that an anastomotic angle of <30\u00b0 was an independent factor predicting decreased primary patency (P = .009) and secondary patency (P = .03) as well as increased reinterventions (P = .004). In BC fistulas, the median anastomotic angle was 90\u00b0. Patients with anastomotic angles <90\u00b0 and \u226590\u00b0 had similar rates of primary patency (67% vs 67%, P = .39) and secondary patency (93% vs 94%, P = .89) at 6 months, with a similar reintervention rate at 12 months (31% vs 32%, P = .56). Vein diameter was the only factor that predicted reintervention (P < .0001).\nRC fistulas with anastomotic angles of <30\u00b0 have reduced primary and secondary patency and increased numbers of reinterventions, suggesting that, if possible, surgeons should avoid an anastomotic angle of <30\u00b0 when creating RC fistulas. Anastomotic angles of <90\u00b0 or \u226590\u00b0 may not play a role in outcome of BC fistulas.",

    "abstract": "Aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination with electrocardiography gating is becoming the clinical routine image acquisition protocol for diagnosis and intervention planning. To minimize motion artifact, the images are reconstructed in the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. The aim of our study was to quantify aortic strain in an elderly nonaneurysmatic patient cohort and to identify the phases of the R-R cycle that correspond to the minimal and maximal aortic diameters. The quantification of aortic strain may enable the improvement of intervention planning and the introduction of more effective dose-saving protocols for CTA scans.\nWe assessed CTA images of 28 patients (14 men; mean age, 74 years). Aortic calcium score was calculated on native images. Angiography images were reconstructed in equally spaced 10 phases of the R-R cycle. After semiautomatic centerline analysis, we measured the cross-sectional areas in each of the 10 phases at 9 specific segments between the ascending aorta and the common iliac bifurcation representing the attachment sites of thoracic and abdominal stent grafts. Area-derived effective diameter, pulsatility (Amax - Amin), and strain [(Amax - Amin)/Amin] were calculated. Repeated measurements were taken to evaluate inter-reader and intrareader reproducibility (10-10 patients each).\nA total of 4320 measurements were performed. We found significant difference between diastolic and systolic diameters (DD,Z0 = 33.2, DS,Z0 = 34.4; P < .001). Pulsatility values of the vessel diameters were 1.0 to 1.1 mm in the thoracic aorta, 0.7 to 0.9 mm in the abdominal aorta, and 0.5 to 0.6 mm in the common iliac arteries. Negative, moderate correlations were found between aortic strain and age (r = -0.586; P = .001), aortic strain and plaque area (r = -0.429; P = .026), and age and body mass index (r = -0.412; P = .029). We found positive, moderate correlation between age and plaque area (r = 0.594; P = .001). The aortic pulsatility curve has a positive extreme at 30% and a negative extreme at 90% of the R-R cycle throughout the aorta. Lin concordance coefficients were 0.987 for inter-reader and 0.994 for intrareader correlations.\nAortic strain can be reliably quantified on electrocardiography-gated CTA images. Pulsatility of the aorta can be substantial in the thoracic aortic segments of young patients; therefore, the routine use of systolic images is not recommended. In addition, we demonstrated that images at 30% of the heart cycle correspond to the largest diameter of the aorta.",

Pulsatility values of the vessel diameters were 1.0 to 1.1 mm in the thoracic aorta, 0.7 to 0.9 mm in the abdominal aorta, and 0.5 to 0.6 mm in the common iliac arteries. Negative, moderate correlations were found between aortic strain and age (r = -0.586; P = .001), aortic strain and plaque area (r = -0.429; P = .026), and age and body mass index (r = -0.412; P = .029). We found positive, moderate correlation between age and plaque area (r = 0.594; P = .001). The aortic pulsatility curve has a positive extreme at 30% and a negative extreme at 90% of the R-R cycle throughout the aorta. Lin concordance coefficients were 0.987 for inter-reader and 0.994 for intrareader correlations.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith Alpha Thoracic Endovascular Graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) for the treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and large ulcers.\nThe Zenith Alpha Thoracic Endovascular Graft, with a 16F to 20F delivery system, was developed to address vascular access issues associated with larger-profile devices and to increase conformability in tortuous anatomy. This prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study was conducted in Europe, Japan, and the United States. The main anatomical inclusion criteria included proximal neck seal zone of \u226520 mm, aortic arch radius of \u226520 mm, and a neck diameter of 15 to 42 mm. Patients were evaluated preprocedure, predischarge, and postdischarge 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter through 5 years.\nBetween March 2010 and January 2013, 110 patients (64 men and 46 women; mean age, 72 \u00b1 10 years) were enrolled in the study for the treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (n = 90) or ulcers (n = 20). Access was percutaneous in 36% (40 of 110) of patients. The study device was successfully implanted in all but two patients (both due to inability to gain access or advance to the target treatment site). There was no 30-day mortality. Five deaths occurred \u22641 year (only one was aneurysm-related by independent adjudication), resulting in a 95% freedom from all-cause mortality and a 99% freedom from thoracic aortic aneurysm-related mortality. At one or more time points \u22641 year, type I endoleak (all distal) was observed in 4 patients, type III endoleak in 2, and aneurysm growth in 4. Five patients experienced stroke \u22641 year (2 procedure-related). No aortic rupture, paraplegia, paralysis, or permanent spinal cord injury was observed \u22641 year.\nEarly outcomes after Zenith Alpha implantation appear promising and suggest expanded thoracic endovascular aortic repair applicability in patients with smaller access vessels. Longer-term follow-up is ongoing.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery geometry has been suggested as a risk factor for atherosclerotic carotid artery disease (ACD). Although normal aging and development of disease can both lead to geometric changes in the artery, whether geometric changes in a given artery actually predispose to disease or are just a consequence of remodeling during aging is unclear. We investigated carotid artery geometric changes with aging to identify geometric features associated with the presence of ACD.\nCarotid artery geometry was quantified by measuring carotid artery diameter, tortuosity, and bifurcation angle using three-dimensional reconstructions of thin-section computed tomography angiography scans in 15 healthy individuals (average age, 43 \u00b1 18 years; range, 15-64 years). The same geometric features were measured in 17 patients (68 \u00b1 10 years old) with unilateral ACD. Geometric features associated with presence of ACD were determined by using the nondiseased contralateral carotid artery as an intrinsic control. Elastin-stained carotid arteries were analyzed to assess age-related structural changes in 12 deceased individuals.\nIncreases were noted in bulb diameter (0.64 mm), bifurcation angle (10\u00b0), and tortuosity of the common carotid (CCA; 0.03) and internal carotid arteries (ICA; 0.04) for every decade of life. Density and continuity of circumferential and longitudinal elastin in the CCA and ICA decreased with age. Compared with normal carotid arteries, those with ACD demonstrated larger bulb diameters (P = .001) but smaller bifurcation angles (P = .001). CCA tortuosity (P = .038) increased in ACD arteries compared with normal carotid arteries, but ICA tortuosity was decreased (P = .026).\nWith increasing age, bulb diameter, tortuosity, and bifurcation angle increases in carotid arteries. These geometric changes may be related to degradation and fragmentation of intramural elastin. Arteries with atherosclerotic occlusive disease demonstrate decreased ICA tortuosity and smaller bifurcation angles compared with nondiseased carotid arteries.",

Atherosclerosis is increasingly considered a chronic inflammatory disease with pathogenic autoimmune processes. Regulatory T cells, and their cytokines, have been implicated in the inhibition of the development of atherosclerotic lesions and involved in the immunologic tolerance induction.\nEight-week-old male C57BL6 LDL-receptor deficient (LDLR(-/-)) mice were fed a cholesterol-rich (2.8%), high-saturated-fat (82%) diet for a week and divided in five groups. The groups received the following intravenous immunizations: group I (control group): one dose of 5 \u03bcg \u03b22-GPI; group II: 5 \u03bcg \u03b22-GPI I and 1 \u03bcg IL-2; group III: 5 \u03bcg \u03b22-GPI and 0.75 \u03bcg of IL-10; and group IV: 5 \u03bcg \u03b22-GPI, 1 \u03bcg IL-2, and 0.75 \u03bcg IL-10. The aortas of the mice were assessed 8 weeks after inoculation to determine the aortic lesion size and composition in all groups.\n\u03b22-GPI immunization attenuated the early atherosclerotic lesions development compared with the control group (P = .001).

The association of both cytokines did not provoke a major inhibition in the atherosclerosis development when compared with groups injected with the two cytokines separately.\nThe immunotolerance induction against \u03b22-GPI attenuates the development of atherosclerosis lesions in an animal model, enhanced by downregulation of the cellular and humoral autoimmune response provoked by IL-2 and IL-10.",

    "abstract": "Cathepsin G (CatG) is a serine protease that mediates angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Ang-II) conversion and is highly expressed in human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, it remains untested whether this protease participates in the pathogenesis of AAA.\nImmunofluorescent double staining demonstrated the expression of CatG in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), macrophages, and endothelial cells in human AAA lesions (n = 12) but not in AAA-free aortas (n = 10). Whereas inflammatory cytokines induced CatG expression, high glucose concentration increased CatG activity in producing Ang-II and angiotensin-converting enzyme in SMCs, which could be fully blocked by a CatG-selective inhibitor or its small interfering RNA. To test whether CatG contributes to AAA development, we generated CatG and low-density lipoprotein receptor double deficient (Ldlr(-/-)Ctsg(-/-)) mice and their littermate controls (Ldlr(-/-)Ctsg(+/+)). Absence of CatG did not affect Ang-II infusion-induced AAAs. In contrast, in Ang-II-independent AAAs induced by periaortic CaCl2 injury (n = 12 per group), CatG deficiency significantly reduced aortic diameter increase (58.33% \u00b1 6.83% vs 31.67% \u00b1 5.75%; P = .007), aortic lesion area (0.35 \u00b1 0.04 mm(2) vs 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 mm(2); P = .005), and aortic wall elastin fragmentation grade (2.75 \u00b1 0.18 vs 1.58 \u00b1 0.17; P = .002) along with reduced lesion collagen content grade (2.80 \u00b1 0.17 vs 2.12 \u00b1 0.17; P = .009) without affecting indices of lesion inflammation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, or apoptosis. In vitro elastin degradation assays demonstrated that CaCl2-induced AAA lesions from Ldlr(-/-)Ctsg(-/-) mice contained much lower elastinolytic activity than in those from littermate control mice. Gelatin gel zymogram assay suggested that absence of CatG in CaCl2-induced AAA lesions also reduced the activity of elastinolytic matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9.\nCatG may contribute to CaCl2-induced experimental AAAs directly through its elastinolytic activity and indirectly by regulating lesion matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 activities. Increased expression of CatG in vascular and inflammatory cells of human AAAs and its increased activity in producing Ang-II and angiotensin-converting enzyme by SMCs suggest an additional mechanism by which CatG contributes to AAA lesion progression.",

    "abstract": "Murine models have proved instrumental in studying various aspects of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), from identification of underlying pathophysiologic changes to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In the current study, we describe a new model in which an elastase-treated donor aorta is transplanted to a recipient mouse and allowed to progress to aneurysm. We hypothesized that by transplanting an elastase-treated abdominal aorta of one genotype to a recipient mouse of a different genotype, one can differentiate pathophysiologic factors that are intrinsic to the aortic wall from those stemming from circulation and other organs.\nElastase-treated aorta was transplanted to the infrarenal abdominal aorta of recipient mice by end-to-side microsurgical anastomosis. Heat-inactivated elastase-treated aorta was used as a control. Syngeneic transplants were performed with use of 12-week-old C57BL/6 littermates. Transplant grafts were harvested from recipient mice on day 7 or day 14 after surgery. The aneurysm outcome was measured by aortic expansion, elastin degradation, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and inflammatory cell infiltration and compared with that produced with the established, conventional elastase infusion model.\nThe surgical technique success rate was 75.6%, and the 14-day survival rate was 51.1%. By day 14 after surgery, all of the elastase-treated transplanted abdominal aortas had dilated and progressed to AAAs, defined as 100% or more increase in the maximal external diameter compared with that measured before elastase perfusion, whereas none of the transplanted aortas pretreated with inactive elastase became aneurysmal (percentage increase in maximum aortic diameter: 159.36%\u00a0\u00b1 23.27%, transplanted elastase, vs 41.46%\u00a0\u00b1 9.34%, transplanted inactive elastase). Aneurysm parameters, including elastin degradation and infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes, were found to be identical to those observed in the conventional elastase model. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed similarly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (relative changes of mRNA in the conventional elastase model vs transplant model: tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, 1.71\u00a0\u00b1 0.27 vs 2.93\u00a0\u00b1 0.86; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, 2.36\u00a0\u00b1 0.58 vs 2.87\u00a0\u00b1 0.51; chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, 3.37\u00a0\u00b1 0.92 vs 3.46\u00a0\u00b1 0.83; and interferon \u03b3, 3.09\u00a0\u00b1 0.83 vs 5.30\u00a0\u00b1 1.69). Using green fluorescent protein transgenic mice as donors or recipients, we demonstrated that a small quantity of mononuclear leukocytes in the transplant grafts bared the genotype of the donors.\nTransplanted elastase-treated abdominal aorta could develop to aneurysm in recipient mice. This AAA transplant model can be used to examine how the microenvironment of a transplanted aneurysmal aorta may be altered by the contributions of the \"global\" environment of the recipient.",

    "abstract": "Arterioportal fistulas (APFs) are rare vascular communications between the mesenteric arterial tree and the portal vein. The causes and presentations of this entity are varied. APFs related to tumor, infection, and trauma have been described. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with hemobilia, portal hypertension, or mesenteric steal syndrome. Small APFs require no intervention, with treatment indicated for large or symptomatic APFs. The treatment has shifted from surgical ligation or hepatic resection to an endovascular-first approach. We describe an endovascular treatment option for the management of an acquired extrahepatic (type 2) APF and present a review of the literature.",
