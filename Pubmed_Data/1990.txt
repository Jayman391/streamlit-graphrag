    "abstract": "To evaluate the fate of free-floating venous thrombi, venous duplex scans of 5238 consecutive lower extremities over a 2 1/2 year period were reviewed. Acute deep venous thrombosis was found in 732 cases. Eighty-two free-floating deep venous thrombi were diagnosed in 73 of these patients. Nine of 72 patients (13%) had pulmonary emboli as diagnosed by ventilation perfusion scanning or pulmonary angiography or both. Seven of these patients (78%) had a pulmonary embolus before the initial duplex scan. Two (22%) had a pulmonary embolus after the diagnosis of free-floating thrombus. Thirty-three of 73 patients (45%) had follow-up of free-floating thrombi by duplex scanning performed in the acute period (less than 30 days): 18 (55%) showed attachment of the free-floating thrombus, three (9%) showed progression in size of the free-floating tail, and eight (24%) showed decrease in size or resolution of the free-floating thrombus. Four (12%) showed persistent thrombus without evidence of resolution, propagation, or attachment. In conclusion, free-floating venous thrombi occurred in 10% of cases of acute deep venous thrombosis. Only 13% of free-floating thrombi were associated with clinically significant pulmonary emboli, confirmed by ventilation perfusion scanning. Usually the embolus occurred before diagnosis of free-floating thrombus. Most free-floating thrombi followed noninvasively by duplex scanning do not embolize, but rather they become attached to the vein wall or resolve.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis has traditionally relied on detection of alterations in venous hemodynamics. Although phleborheography is among the most sensitive tests, it is inadequate for diagnosing infrapopliteal and nonocclusive proximal thrombi and for surveillance of patients at high risk for deep venous thrombosis. Venous duplex imaging is a new technique being rapidly accepted, however, without the same critical analysis given to previous diagnostic modalities. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic acumen of venous duplex imaging compared to phleborheography and ascending phlebography in two distinct patient groups, and to determine whether patient selection, and thus the location or magnitude of thrombi have significant influence on these diagnostic tests. One hundred ten extremities in 103 patients were prospectively evaluated with venous duplex imaging, phleborheography, and ascending phlebography within the same 24-hour period. Patients were categorized into one of two groups: Diagnostic--patients evaluated because of clinical suspicion of acute deep venous thrombosis; and Surveillance--patients at high risk of postoperative deep venous thrombosis after total joint replacement, but not symptomatic. Patients in the diagnostic group had a greater frequency of deep venous thrombosis (p less than 0.001) and significantly more occluding above-knee thrombi (p = 0.054) compared to those in the surveillance group. Phleborheography detected 73% (27/37) of above-knee thrombi in the diagnostic group compared to 29% (2/7) in the surveillance group (p = 0.036). This difference was not noted with venous duplex imaging, which detected 100% of above-knee thrombi in both diagnostic and surveillance groups and 78% (7/9) of all below-knee thrombi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Functional comparisons of cryopreserved and fresh canine vein endothelium, smooth muscle, and connective tissue were performed. Morphometric analysis of saphenous vein endothelium revealed no significant loss of endothelial integrity as a result of cryopreservation. Endothelial cell culture revealed similar numbers of clonogenic intimal cells from cryopreserved and fresh saphenous, cephalic, and jugular veins. Smooth muscle function was assessed by measurement of the isometric force generated by vein rings in response to norepinephrine, serotonin, and potassium chloride. There was no significant difference in the dose responses of cryopreserved and fresh saphenous veins to the reagents tested. Similar results were obtained for the cephalic and jugular vein experiments with norepinephrine. The maximum tensions generated in response to norepinephrine were 52% of fresh control segments. Connective tissue function was assessed by quantitation of 3H-proline incorporation. The results indicate that cryopreserved veins retained approximately 43.5% of values of fresh vein collagen synthesis. Finally, eight cryopreserved cephalic vein autografts were placed as femoral artery grafts and were removed electively after 1 to 8 weeks. All grafts were patent. Both light and electron microscopy demonstrated that the cryopreserved veins remained intact in vivo and that arteriolization occurred as described for fresh autografts in the literature. In conclusion, cryopreserved veins retain much of their cellular and tissue functions on thawing. Transplantation of cryopreserved veins suggests that cryopreservation does not change the sequence of histologic events associated with the use of autologous fresh vein as an arterial substitute.",

    "abstract": "Current management of penetrating injuries in the proximity of major extremity arteries with no evidence of vascular trauma remains controversial. A total of 318 such injuries in 254 patients were evaluated prospectively to clarify the appropriate timing and role of arteriography, as well as the natural history of these injuries. The arteries at risk were: axillary, 47; brachial, 57; superficial femoral, 176; and popliteal, 38. No deaths occurred, and no morbidity resulted from arteriographic delay of 6 to 24 hours after injury. Of the 48 arteriographic abnormalities detected, 16 involved noncritical branch vessels. There were 32 injuries to major arteries (10.0%), including localized narrowing (n = 13), intimal flap (n = 12), false aneurysm (n = 6), and arteriovenous fistula (n = 1). Shotgun wounds led to a greater arterial injury rate (3/17; 17.6%) than did gunshot wounds (24/247; 9.7%) or stab wounds (5/54; 9.3%). At the surgeon's discretion, three injuries underwent immediate exploration (one negative), whereas the remaining 29 vessel injuries were followed up nonoperatively by repeat arteriography (n = 22) or clinical examination (n = 7), for a mean interval of 2.8 months. Fifteen abnormalities resolved, 10 improved or remained unchanged, and 4 worsened. The four lesions (13.7%) that worsened (two shotgun and two axillary artery injuries) were identified within 3 months of injury and repaired surgically with no morbidity. In conclusion, only 6 operations were required out of 3218 potential injuries (1.8%), suggesting that routine arteriography is not a cost-effective means of evaluating these injuries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We have treated 30 patients requiring urgent or emergent vascular procedures in the first 6 weeks after a myocardial infarction (median 11 days) from 1977 through 1989. Forty operations were performed, including 28 lower extremity revascularizations, 10 major amputations and revisions, and two carotid endarterectomies. There were four postoperative deaths (three cardiac related) and two nonfatal reinfarctions. Cardiac complications did not correlate with age, interval from myocardial infarction to surgery within the initial 6 weeks, type of anesthesia, or complexity of operation. Twenty of 24 patients survived attempts at leg revascularization, with ultimate limb salvage in 16. Our cardiac complication rate of 17% (5/30 patients) was reasonably close to that predicted by the Goldman risk scale for classes II and III and significantly better than class IV and also better than that predicted by the Cooperman risk scale for vascular surgery, despite the more recent preoperative myocardial infarctions in our patients. We attribute our low morbidity and mortality to the extracavitary nature of the procedures and possibly to improvements in anesthetic and perioperative management. Patients requiring urgent revascularization for limb salvage should not be denied surgery on the basis of a recent myocardial infarction.",

This prolonged interval may increase the danger of recurrent neurologic deficit before surgery. From September 1978 to September 1988, carotid endarterectomy was performed on 140 patients at variable intervals after stroke. Eleven patients had temporary stroke, which left 129 patients with neurologic symptoms that persisted for 3 weeks or had a cortical infarct on CT scanning. A prospective therapeutic protocol was applied to 82 patients admitted with acute stroke. They were observed until neurologic recovery reached a plateau, based on clinical observation by a neurologist, before performing angiography and carotid endarterectomy (group I). Forty-seven patients were not seen until after recovery from stroke was established (group II). At initial presentation, the severity of neurologic deficit was classified as mild, moderate, or severe in 31%, 58%, and 11%, respectively. Recovery before operation was registered as complete in 11%, mild residual in 66%, moderate residual in 21%, and severe residual in 2%. Group I patients (n = 82, 64%) were operated on within 6 weeks of stroke and group II (n = 47, 36%) were operated on at varying times after 6 weeks.

One hundred fourteen patients with skull base tumors or intracranial aneurysms potentially requiring carotid resection or ligation underwent angiography, xenon CT cerebral blood flow mapping, and internal carotid artery blood pressure monitoring. The internal carotid artery was then temporarily occluded with a balloon catheter, stump pressure was measured through the catheter, and the xenon CT cerebral blood flow mapping was repeated. Adequate xenon CT cerebral blood flow was defined as greater than 30 cc/100 gm/min. All patients had normal xenon CT cerebral blood flow before internal carotid artery occlusion. During internal carotid artery occlusion, xenon CT cerebral blood flow was found to be normal (group I, 40 patients), globally reduced but still within the normal range (group II, 50 patients), or low in the distribution of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (group III, 13 patients). With balloon occlusion, an immediate neurologic deficit developed in 11 patients (9%) requiring deflation of the balloon preceding xenon CT cerebral blood flow measurement (group IV). In group I internal carotid artery blood pressure was 128 mm Hg. (range 85 to 171 mm Hg) with stump pressure 86 mm Hg (range 46 to 125 mm Hg).

    "abstract": "A 33-year experience with 58 ureteral complications in 50 of 3580 patients undergoing aortoiliac reconstruction was analyzed. Ureteral obstruction was treated before or in conjunction with aneurysm repair in six patients with aneurysmal disease. The remaining 44 patients had 46 ureteral complications after aortic reconstruction; complications included hydronephrosis (42), ureteral leak (3), and ureteral necrosis (1). A high incidence of associated graft complications was noted. Graft thrombosis developed in one of the six patients undergoing prior or simultaneous ureteral procedures, and graft infection developed in another. Thirty-six graft complications developed in 24 (55%) of the 44 patients with postoperative ureteral complications. The complications included 19 anastomotic aneurysms, eight graft limb thromboses, six graft infections, and three aortoenteric fistulas. Twenty-nine of the 44 patients with postoperative ureteral complications underwent ureteral or graft operations or both. These included five patients having ureteral operations alone, seven with a ureteral procedure and subsequent graft operation, eight requiring simultaneous ureteral and graft procedures, and nine undergoing a graft operation with ureteral observation. Six of these 29 patients (21%) died after operation, all from graft complications including aortoenteric fistulas (three), ruptured anastomotic aneurysms (two), and graft infection (one). Graft complications affected 55% of 44 patients with postoperative ureteral complications, compared to 12% of 3536 patients without ureteral complications (p less than 0.0001). Patients with postoperative ureteral complications were 4.4 times as likely to have graft complications compared to those without ureteral complications (p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that such urologic complications may be markers for recognition of or harbingers for graft complications.",

    "abstract": "During the past 2 decades 102 consecutive patients (77 men and 25 women) with multiple aortic aneurysms underwent 201 aortic reconstructions. These procedures (174 elective and 27 emergent) represented 3.4% of the 5837 aortic aneurysm operations performed. Seventy-five (30.9%) of the 243 aneurysms occurred in the infrarenal aorta, 65 occurred in the descending aorta (26.7%), 56 occurred in the thoracoabdominal aorta (23.0%), and 47 occurred in the ascending aorta or arch (19.3%). Ages ranged from 20 to 81 years (mean 63.3 years). Smoking history and abnormal electrocardiographic tracings were present in 84.3% of the patients, hypertension was present in 77.5%, and obstructive lung disease was present in 60.8%. Multiple aortic aneurysms were present at the time of the first repair in 55 patients (53.9%). Twelve patients had one procedure, 81 had two, and nine had three. Sixteen (17.8%) of the 90 patients who had multiple operations had a subsequent operation for complications of the unrepaired aneurysm (rupture 12, symptoms 4). Fourteen perioperative deaths occurred among the 174 elective repairs (8.0%), and 11 occurred among the 27 emergent procedures (40.7%). Procedure mortality increased with the ordinal number of elective operations and was 4.4% for the first, 10.4% for the second, and 33.3% for the third. Seven of 21 patients (33.3%) who had simultaneous repair of at least two aortic aneurysms died in the perioperative period. Overall, 77 of the 102 patients (75.5%) survived all surgical procedures to repair their multiple aortic aneurysms; of these, 63 had complete resection of all known aneurysms. Follow-up was complete in all patients and averaged 6.3 years (ranges: 1 month to 19 years). There were 30 late deaths; the most frequent cause was myocardial infarction. Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival including perioperative deaths for all patients after the first operation was 76% and after the last operation 40%. We conclude that multiple aortic aneurysms can be safely managed, usually with staged repairs, and that long-term survival is probably. After the first aortic operation the presence of multiple aneurysms mandates close observation with timely surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "The results of the use of prosthetic materials for femorocrural bypass surgery have been less than optimal. The creation of a distal anastomotic arteriovenous fistula to augment blood flow and velocity through the graft is well known. However, it may create turbulence at the anastomosis and steal blood flow away from the distal artery. A canine model was developed to evaluate the effect of fistula size on graft/arterial hemodynamics. In 16 patients we have constructed a distal arteriovenous fistula, which is remote from the distal anastomosis, and we studied the effect of such fistulas on bypass patency and distal arterial hemodynamics. Patients selected for this procedure had multiple previously failed reconstructions and limb-threatening ischemia and did not have usable autogenous vein. Femorotibial bypass graft reconstructions were performed with polytetrafluoroethylene followed by the creation of a side-to-side arteriovenous fistula 5 to 15 cm below the distal anastomosis in the same artery and accompanying veins. We have achieved a 1-year patency of 67% with a 75% limb salvage rate. We also serially measured blood flow and velocity within the bypass, the arteriovenous fistula, and the distal outflow vessel using duplex scanning after surgery. Mean estimated blood flow through the bypass during the immediate postoperative period was 264 ml/min, the arteriovenous fistula was 157 ml/min, and the distal artery was 19 ml/min. Unlike an arteriovenous fistula created at the distal anastomosis, a remote distal arteriovenous fistula not only increases graft blood flow but also augments native arterial blood flow between the distal anastomosis and fistula and thus may improve distal limb perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Sixty-five patients received 68 inframalleolar arterial grafts for severe rest pain, foot ulceration, or gangrene. Patients were elderly with an average age of 68 years (median 72); most had several operative risk factors. Reversed saphenous vein grafts were used early, but most conduits were in situ vein grafts. The recipient vessel was the dorsalis pedis artery in 39 patients, the posterior tibial in 27, and tarsal branches in two. Preoperative angiography was routinely performed with biplanar and digital arterial techniques, but in nearly a third a suitable bypass vessel was not identified preoperatively. When vessels were identified there was usually only a single patent artery suitable for bypass grafting below the knee. There were five postoperative deaths (7.6%). Eight grafts (11%) required early revision for thrombosis or retained valve, and six were salvaged and remained patent. Poor vein quality appeared responsible for the two early failures. Six late graft occlusions occurred from 4 to 39 months (mean 14 months). Three of these patients had no recurrence of their ulceration, but two required amputation, and one has continued rest pain. One additional amputation was required in a patient with a patent graft. Eleven late deaths (16%) occurred (nine with patent grafts) primarily of cardiac causes.",

    "abstract": "To identify factors predisposing to wound infection and necrosis complicating in situ or other subcutaneous autogenous lower extremity vein bypass procedures, we retrospectively analyzed all such cases performed in our hospital between July 1983 and July 1988. Among 163 subcutaneous autogenous bypass grafts, wound complications developed in 28 (17%). According to progressive depth of involvement as defined in the text, 10 patients had grade I complications, six had grade II, and 12 had grade III complications with threatened or actual graft exposure. Factors significantly associated with wound morbidity were female gender, chronic steroid therapy, in situ bypass grafting, use of continuous incision (all p less than or equal to 0.05, chi square); diabetes mellitus, ipsilateral limb ulcer, limb salvage indication (all p less than 0.01); and bypass grafting to the dorsalis pedis artery (p less than 0.02). A logistic regression analysis identified four factors (in situ bypass grafting, steroid therapy, ipsilateral ulcer, and dorsalis pedis bypass grafting) that predicted a cumulatively increasing risk of wound complications, and in whose absence wound complications were rare. Grade I and II complications responded to standard regimens of wound care and intravenous antibiotics without loss of any graft or limb. In spite of aggressive efforts to provide secondary soft tissue coverage, grade III complications led directly to four major amputations and one death. Measures to prevent these morbid sequelae must include preoperative control of infection in the ischemic foot and meticulous attention to operative technique.",

The displacement profiles of the dye traces were photographed, resulting in the acquisition of the velocity profiles. From these traces, the flow pattern was determined, and the wall shear stresses were measured. Turbulence was generated 3.3 to 6.5 tube diameters downstream from the edge of the stenosis, depending on the time in the pulsatile flow cycle. Maximum wall shear stress fluctuations between positive and negative values appeared to lie within 1.6 to 3.3 tube diameters downstream of the stenosis. In several illustrative clinical cases of thoracic outlet arterial compression, the poststenotic dilation was maximum at 2.0 +/- 0.3 vessel diameters downstream. Based on these observations, it is postulated that wall shear stress fluctuations may be important in the development of poststenotic dilation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of collateral supply from the hypogastric arteries (HGAs) to the inferior mesenteric arterial (IMA) bed. Peak systolic \"stump\" IMA and radial arterial pressures were obtained before and after clamping the right HGA, the left HGA, both HGAs, the middle colic artery (MCA) only, or the MCA plus right HGA, MCA plus left HGA, and MCA plus both HGAs in patients with aortoiliac aneurysm or occlusive disease. Six patients (four with aneurysms and two with occlusive disease) had patent IMAs. Five patients (four with aneurysms and one with occlusive disease) had chronically occluded IMAs. In the six patients with patent IMAs, clamping of the HGAs decreased the IMA-stump pressure index (IMA-SPI) from 0.61 +/- 0.20 to 0.56 +/- 0.17, 0.54 +/- 0.17, and 0.54 +/- 0.19, respectively (p greater than 0.05) whereas clamping only the MCA decreased the IMA-SPI from 0.61 +/- 0.20 to 0.32 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.01). In the five patients with chronically occluded IMAs, clamping of the HGAs decreased the IMA-SPI from 0.60 +/- 0.11 to 0.59 +/- 0.12, 0.58 +/- 0.12, and 0.57 +/- 0.11, respectively (p greater than 0.05), whereas clamping the MCA decreased the IMA-SPI from 0.60 +/- 0.11 to 0.34 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that branches of the superior mesenteric artery provide the major collateral pathway to the IMA bed and that the contribution through branches of the HGAs is insignificant in the acute setting.",

    "abstract": "The clinical details, arteriograms, and computerized tomographic (CT) scans of 28 patients with popliteal arteriopathies were reviewed retrospectively to determine the usefulness of CT for the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. Arteriography diagnosed 70% and CT diagnosed 98% of the 45 popliteal disorders. Popliteal aneurysms were not detected by arteriography because of occlusion in seven (20%) patients and intraaneurysmal thrombus that produced no luminal compromise in two. Thrombus was identified by CT in 22 of 24 patient aneurysms and suspected as the source of digital embolization in 7. Graft aneurysms were identified by CT in two cases, but one was not detected by arteriography because of graft occlusion. Two mycotic aneurysms were identified, one by arteriography and not by CT because of misinterpretation of a periarterial hematoma. Popliteal entrapment was diagnosed by CT in three cases, and in two cases occlusion precluded diagnosis of entrapment by arteriography. Adventitial cystic disease was diagnosed accurately by CT in three cases, and in two there were no characteristic arteriographic abnormalities. In cases of entrapment and cystic disease, the CT findings allow the surgeon to plan his approach through a posterior incision, which in these two instances facilitates surgical technique. CT provides detail of the arterial wall, intraarterial contents, and surrounding musculoskeletal anatomy, all of which are useful for accurate evaluation of arterial disorders of the popliteal fossa.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic grafts of vein allografts are inadequate as small-diameter vessel substitutes. We have applied ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation to modulate the immunogenicity of vein allografts to avoid immunologic injury. The veins of male ACI rats were irradiated with UVB (60 mJ/cm2) in situ and transplanted to male ACI rats (autografts) and female Lewis rats (allografts). Nonirradiated veins served as controls. At 4, 7, 14, and 28 days, all grafts were patent and were studied for morphologic changes by scanning electron microscopy and for immunogold labeling of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression. In autografts, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated minimal endothelial loss after grafting, regardless of UVB irradiation. Untreated allografts showed severe endothelial injury 4, 7, and 14 days after transplantation. UVB irradiation of veins protected allografts from injury to the endothelium and basement membrane. Major histocompatibility complex class II-positive endothelial cells were not seen in autografts but were seen in 40% of cells 4 days after transplantation in untreated allografts. UVB-treated allografts showed MHC class II antigen expression labeling of 20% of the endothelial cells. Barr body analysis demonstrated the donor origin of these endothelial cells. UVB irradiation of rat vein allografts prolongs endothelial survival while decreasing endothelial surface expression of class II antigens. These data suggest that modification of vein immunogenicity with UVB irradiation may permit functional survival of small-vessel allografts without chronic immunosuppression.",

    "abstract": "Successful recanalization of isolated femoropopliteal occlusions by laser-assisted balloon angioplasty has been widely reported. However, the utility of this approach in other sites remains undetermined. The potential of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty in the treatment of a broad spectrum of lower extremity atherosclerosis was explored. Seventy-seven limbs in 69 patients were treated with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty by means of a percutaneous approach. Technical success was achieved in 62/77 (81%), with 52/77 (68%) open at discharge. At a mean of 8.6 months' follow-up, cumulative patency was 50% at 6 months and 42% at 9 months. In 10 cases initial guide wire placement was not possible; primary laser probe passage was technically successful in six, with two open at latest follow-up. Eleven patients underwent laser therapy without balloon angioplasty of distal sites with technical success in eight; at most recent follow-up five were open at the site of sole laser therapy. Complications were frequent. Bleeding requiring transfusion occurred in six, with three patients requiring emergency surgery; worsened ischemia necessitating urgent arterial bypass grafting developed in five patients. In this series laser angioplasty carried significant complications and a high failure rate. Widespread application of this procedure should await further clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "Iloprost (a long-acting prostacyclin analog) has been demonstrated to decrease cardiac muscle infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion injury. We investigated the ability of iloprost to decrease skeletal muscle injury and platelet sequestration after ischemia-reperfusion injury in a canine bilateral isolated gracilis muscle model. Anesthesized animals (n = 13) were subjected to 6 hours of gracilis muscle ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. Fifteen minutes before muscle reperfusion, the animals were infused with radium 111-labeled autogenous platelets. Experimental animals (n = 7) received a continuous preischemic intravenous infusion of iloprost (0.45 microgram/kg/hr) and two 0.45 microgram/kg intravenous injections of iloprost (10 minutes before the ischemic interval and 10 minutes before reperfusion). Muscle injury was measured with triphenyltetrazolium chloride histochemical staining. Platelet sequestration within ischemic muscle specimens was determined by measuring indium 111 activity in a gamma counter. Iloprost infusion decreased muscle infarct size from 57.0% +/- 12.6% in control animals to 15.8% +/- 4.4% in experimental animals (p less than 0.05). Platelet uptake in experimental and control muscle was 1.2 +/- 0.21 x 10(7) and 2.17 +/- 0.48 x 10(7) platelets/gm ischemic muscle, respectively (p = 0.1). Although platelet sequestration was not altered significantly in this experiment, a reduction in skeletal muscle injury was confirmed. Further investigation on the mechanisms of action of iloprost in chronic and acute skeletal muscle ischemia is warranted.",

The operative mortality rate for descending thoracic aortic dissection repair was 14% and that for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm repair was 8%, with an overall mortality rate of 10%. All three of the patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic replacement survived. The mean cross-clamp time for sutureless tube graft insertion was 9 minutes. The average blood replacement was 2.4 units/patient. No patient suffered serious neurologic or renal impairment. A single nonfatal case of graft dislodgement occurred after placement. No evidence of hemolysis, pseudoaneurysm formation, graft erosion, graft migration, or anastomotic bleeding was present in any of the remaining patients. Modification of the sutureless intraluminal device to suit the pathologic condition encountered at operation allows rapid repair with a low incidence of anastomotic complication.",

    "abstract": "A prospective, randomized study was conducted to compare the retroperitoneal versus transperitoneal approach for elective aortic reconstruction. One hundred thirteen patients (transperitoneal = 59, retroperitoneal = 54) were randomized between March 1987 and October 1988. In addition, to assess the changing course of patients undergoing aortic reconstruction similar data were gathered retrospectively on a group of 56 patients undergoing aortic reconstruction by the same surgeons performed via a transperitoneal approach in 1984 to 1985. Randomized patients were identical in age, male to female ratio, smoking history, incidence and severity of cardiopulmonary disease, indication for operation, and use of epidural anesthetics. Details of operation including operative and aortic cross-clamp times, crystalloid and transfusion requirements, degree of hypothermia on arrival at the intensive care unit, and perioperative fluid and blood requirements did not differ significantly for patients undergoing transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal reconstruction. Respiratory morbidity, as assessed by percent of patients requiring postoperative ventilation, deterioration in pulmonary function tests, and the incidence of respiratory complications, was identical in randomized patients. Other aspects of postoperative recovery including recovery of gastrointestinal function, the requirement for narcotics, metabolic parameters of operative stress, the incidence of major and minor complications, and the duration of hospital stay were similar for randomized patients undergoing transperitoneal and retroperitoneal reconstruction. When compared to retrospectively reviewed patients having aortic reconstruction, randomized patients undergoing transperitoneal and retroperitoneal operations had highly significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in postoperative ventilation, transfusion requirements, and length of hospital stay. Such trends were all independent of transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Fifty-eight children who underwent diagnostic femoral artery catheterization before 5 years of age, from 5 to 14 years before the study, were randomly selected from approximately 300 surviving patients undergoing diagnostic femoral artery catheterization at our institution during the interval. Each patient underwent vascular laboratory segmental pressure and waveform examination and arterial duplex scanning, as well as lower extremity bone length radiographs, which were considered positive if the catheterized leg was greater than or equal to 1.5 cm shorter than the opposite leg. Thirteen children who had only venous catheterization served as controls. No arterial abnormalities were present in the control patients (mean ankle/brachial index, 1.01). Arterial occlusion was present in both limbs of five patients who had bilateral diagnostic femoral artery catheterization and in 14 limbs of 51 patients who had unilateral diagnostic femoral artery catheterization. Thus arterial occlusion was present in 33% of patients (19 of 58) and in 37% of limbs (24 of 65). The mean ankle/brachial index in the catheterized limbs was 0.79. Leg growth retardation was present in four limbs (8%) of 51 children undergoing unilateral diagnostic femoral artery catheterization and in one (8%) control patient. The inverse relationship between ankle/brachial index and leg growth retardation was significant (R = 0.47, p less than 0.0005). Only one patient had symptoms of arterial occlusion (claudication), and one patient had symptoms of leg growth retardation (gait disturbance). We conclude that arterial occlusion is common after diagnostic femoral artery catheterization in children less than 5 years of age, but that excellent collateral supply prevents leg growth retardation and/or symptomatic arterial insufficiency in most children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Seventy-three patients with small (less than 6 cm in diameter) abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) were selected for nonoperative management and followed up with sequential ultrasound size measurements. Fifty-four men and 19 women, 51 to 89 years of age (mean 70 years), had an initial mean AAA size of 4.1 cm (anteroposterior) x 4.3 cm (lateral) diameter, with a calculated elliptic cross-sectional area of 14.3 cm2. After a mean of 37 months of follow-up, AAA area increased at a mean rate of 20% per year (3 cm2 yr; 0.4 to 0.5 cm/yr diameter). Expansion rate was not affected by initial aneurysm size. During follow-up, only 3 patients (4%) required urgent operation (1 died), 26 patients (36%) died of non-AAA causes, and 26 patients (36%) underwent elective AAA repair because of progressive size increase (1 died). Elective operations were performed at the rate of 10% per year, when mean AAA size had increased to 22 cm2 (5.1 cm in diameter). Multiple regression analysis of clinical parameters available at presentation indicated that subsequent elective AAA repair was predicted by younger age at diagnosis and larger initial aneurysm size. As anticipated, patients who underwent surgery had more rapid aneurysm expansion (5.3 cm2/yr) compared with patients who did not undergo surgery (1.6 cm2/yr; p less than 0.05). This difference was caused by more rapid expansion during later follow-up intervals among patients selected for operation and was not predicted by the change in aneurysm size observed during initial ultrasonographic follow-up. Final aneurysm size was predicted by initial size, duration of follow-up, and both systolic and diastolic pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Ten Veterans Administration medical centers representing all regions of the country participated in a cooperative study to evaluate the etiologic importance of asymptomatic carotid disease in the development of transient ischemic attack and stroke. The study prospectively randomized patients between carotid endarterectomy and nonoperative treatment with both groups receiving 1300 mg aspirin daily. All patients considered for the study had carotid angiography. Inclusion in the study required at least a 50% diameter reduction of the internal carotid artery. Four hundred forty-four patients were randomized between nonoperative (233 patients) and operative groups (211 patients). In the operative group 195 had unilateral carotid endarterectomies, and eight patients had staged bilateral procedures, for a total of 211 carotid operations. Thirty-day mortality was 1.9% (4/211); all resulting from cardiac causes. One patient who died also had a neurologic deficit. The incidence of stroke was 2.4% (5/211), and the combined stroke and mortality rate was 4.3%. Transient ischemic events occurred in two patients (0.9%). Coronary artery disease is the prime determinant of operative mortality and justifies rigorous preoperative cardiac evaluation to identify those patients at risk. This multicenter prospective clinical trial demonstrates that carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed and provides a valid standard with which to compare the nonoperative cohort.",

    "abstract": "The management of internal carotid artery disease contralateral to endarterectomy is highly controversial. At our institution we have adopted an approach by which patients are followed with serial duplex scanning after unilateral carotid endarterectomy. Surgery on the contralateral carotid artery is recommended for patients who exhibit ischemic neurologic symptoms or develop an 80% to 99% carotid stenosis. This strategy is based on previous reports that have documented an increased incidence of strokes in these two groups of patients. As a result, 40 patients among a study population of 200 underwent carotid endarterectomy on the originally unoperated side. The current study reviews the natural history of the patients who were followed without or before operation of the contralateral carotid artery in an attempt to identify other cohorts at increased risk for stroke. Patients were followed for up to 126 months after unilateral carotid endarterectomy (mean, 54 months). Six patients were lost to follow-up (3.0%). By life-table analysis the estimated mean annual rate of progression to greater than or equal to 50% diameter reduction was 3.9% and 1.2% for progression to greater than or equal to 80% stenosis. Only two patients went on to occlusion during follow-up. Neurologic events referable to the contralateral carotid distribution were infrequent. The estimated mean annual rate was 2.9% for transient ischemic attacks and less than 0.8% for strokes. Case history review of the six patients who had strokes during follow-up suggested that only one patient may have benefited from carotid endarterectomy. Conservative management with serial duplex scanning of the unoperated, contralateral carotid artery appears appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The combination of duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography (OPG) has been used by many vascular laboratories for noninvasive evaluation of the carotid arteries. This study was undertaken to determine if OPG significantly improved the accuracy of duplex scanning alone. Three hundred eighty-five carotid arteries were studied in 190 patients with angiograms, duplex scans, or OPG. A total of 329 carotid arteries were examined with all three modalities. Three different criteria were used to interpret the OPG results, one each intended to deliver a high sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. Depending on the criteria used, sensitivity of OPG alone for detecting hemodynamically significant (greater than 50%) stenosis ranged from 53% to 83%, with a specificity of 59% to 94%. Duplex scanning alone had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 90% for similar lesions. If patients with only intracranial arterial stenosis were excluded, the sensitivity of the duplex scan rose to 91%. The addition of OPG to the duplex scan slightly increased sensitivity (range 91% to 95%; difference not significant) but significantly decreased specificity (range 56% to 84%; p less than 0.005). For detecting stenoses greater than 80%, the duplex scan alone had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 88%. The addition of OPG to duplex scanning slightly increased sensitivity for these high-grade lesions but significantly decreased specificity (p less than 0.001) and overall accuracy. These results were unaffected by the presence or absence of intracranial disease. Because the addition of OPG to duplex scanning reduces specificity and accuracy without any significant increase in sensitivity, we no longer use it as part of our routine noninvasive cerebrovascular examination.",

    "abstract": "One hundred seventy-seven patients with infrainguinal bypass grafts were followed by use of standard graft surveillance techniques to learn more about the natural history of hemodynamic abnormalities in the patient with no symptoms. A decrease in the ankle/brachial pressure ratio of 10% or more was considered an abnormal evaluation. Results of the duplex scan were interpreted as abnormal when the peak systolic flow velocity was greater than 120 cm/sec or less than 40 cm/sec. There were 18 graft thromboses (10%) during the period of observation, and nine of these grafts were successfully revised or replaced. Recurrent symptoms prompted graft revision in 20 additional patients, and 18 of these reoperations were successful. Twenty-nine of the 38 reoperations occurred within the first 18 months of the study. The primary cumulative patency rate was 86% at 1 year and 66% at 5 years. The secondary cumulative patency rate was 91% at 1 year and 80% at 5 years. Sudden graft occlusion occurred in five patients after a normal ankle/brachial index. Most of 90 patients with abnormal ankle/brachial indexes reverted to normal at the next visit. Nineteen of the 26 that did not, had significant graft problems, but only eight patients had operable conditions, and five of the eight already had occluded grafts. No patient with a normal ankle/brachial index and duplex scan results had graft occlusion before their next surveillance visit. If the duplex scan outcome was abnormal but the ankle/branchial index normal the incidence of sudden graft occlusion was 4%. In contrast, if the duplex scan outcome was abnormal and the ankle/brachial index is reduced, then the risk of graft occlusion is 66%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The retroperitoneal approach for elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms is an accepted alternative to midline transperitoneal approaches and may provide less physiologic insult and a smoother postoperative course. In recent years we have preferentially used the extended retroperitoneal approach for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms to derive similar physiologic benefits for these patients. Over a 6-year period (1983 to 1989) 76 cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated by emergency aortic replacement. After exclusion of 13 patients whose aneurysmal ruptures were unusual, such as aortoenteric fistula, aortocaval fistula, chronic contained rupture, or visceral involvement, 63 patients were retrospectively studied. Thirty-eight patients were treated via a standard transperitoneal celiotomy and 25 via a left retroperitoneal incision. No significant differences were found between the two groups in regard to cardiac or pulmonary function or duration of preoperative hypotension. Operative mortality was lower in the retroperitoneal group (three of 25, 12%) as compared to the transperitoneal group (13 of 38, 34.2%). Furthermore, the retroperitoneal group required less ventilatory support and tolerated enteral feedings quickly. Length of stay in the hospital was also significantly reduced in the retroperitoneal group. These data indicate that many ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms can be successfully treated through the left retroperitoneal approach. In this nonrandomized clinical series increased survival rates and shorter periods of postoperative recovery were noted in the patients operated with the retroperitoneal approach.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that thrombin interacts with various cell types, stimulating cellular proliferation and protein and prostanoid production. To further delineate its role in vascular healing, we have studied the effects of thrombin on proliferation and matrix production by the cells of the vessel wall. The addition of thrombin (1 unit/ml) to cultures of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells resulted in an increase in cell proliferation (p less than 0.01) and number (p less than 0.03), whereas in cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells thrombin produced a decrease in cell proliferation (p less than 0.01) and number (p less than 0.02). Thrombin also altered matrix composition in cultures of these cells. In both bovine aortic endothelial cells and bovine aortic smooth muscle cell cultures grown in the presence of thrombin, total protein content was significantly increased when compared to controls (p less than 0.03). In bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures the addition of thrombin resulted in a decrease in collagen content (p less than 0.01) and an increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycan content (p less than 0.02). In contrast, in bovine aortic smooth muscle cell cultures thrombin resulted in an increase in collagen content (p less than 0.03), whereas glycosaminoglycan content was unaffected. These findings suggest that thrombin may significantly influence vascular healing and function by altering cell number and matrix composition.",

    "abstract": "Vein graft failure remains a major challenge for the vascular surgeon. Thrombolysis of occluded vein grafts has shown promising short-term results in restoring vein graft patency, however, the long-term results are not established. This study examines the long-term patency and limb salvage after successful thrombolysis and revision of 22 thrombosed vein grafts in 21 patients. There were 17 men and four women with an average age of 60 years (38 to 77 years). Failed vein grafts had an average primary patency of 19 months (1 to 84 months) and included eight in situ grafts and 14 non-in situ grafts. Twelve grafts were to the popliteal level, whereas 10 were infrapopliteal. Thrombolytic agents used included urokinase (15), tissue plasminogen activator (5), and streptokinase (2). After successful thrombolysis, 19 grafts underwent 26 additional procedures including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (9), vein patch angioplasty (4), vein interposition or jump extension graft (9), or other procedures (4). Three patients had no additional procedure, but one was placed on sodium warfarin (Coumadin). After successful initial vein graft salvage, life-table analysis revealed a 36.6% +/- 11.9% patency at 1 year and a 22.9% +/- 11.6% patency at 3 years. After secondary failure six patients had further interventions contributing to an improved limb salvage of 66.9% +/- 11.6% at 1 year and 60.3% +/- 19.0% at 3 years. The results suggest that thrombosed vein grafts initially salvaged with thrombolysis and revision do not have a favorable long-term patency, and that a premium must be placed on the detection of the failing vein graft before thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 3 years angioscopic techniques have been used to guide intraluminal instrumentation in 73 patients undergoing thrombectomy, nine patients with vascular trauma, and 32 patients during laser angioplasty and balloon dilation. After balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy residual, occlusive thrombi tightly adherent to the arterial wall were removed with flexible biopsy forceps in 13 of 73 (18%) patients; underlying intimal flaps were removed in another four. In nine patients traumatic intimal defects caused by iatrogenic cannulation injuries (n = 5) or external trauma (n = 4) were managed by thrombectomy followed by complete or partial intravascular removal of the intimal flap (n = 6) or dissection plane (n = 3) with long flexible forceps and rotating brushes. Traumatic intimal defects observed in two additional patients were judged to be too severe for endoscopic manipulation and required immediate bypass grafting. Inspection after angioplasty in 32 patients revealed wall charring and obvious thermal damage after laser procedures in 28 (87%) and plaque cracking, intimal flaps, and fragmentation in 26 (81%). These defects were underestimated on intraoperative angiography. Large flaps and thrombus were removed endoscopically in three. We conclude that angioscopic study reveals the extent of intimal injury and gives insights into mechanisms of instrumentation. Adherent thrombus after embolectomy by balloon catheter and intimal flaps caused by trauma or angioplasty are common and, if severe, can be successfully treated by endoscopic intravascular manipulation in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Vasoactive agents, including glucagon, have been used in treatment of mesenteric ischemia. Such drugs change both intestinal blood flow and metabolism. Since reperfusion injury reflects the metabolic state of an organ as well as the duration and severity of ischemia, we investigated the effect of glucagon in a standard model of intestinal ischemia. Data were generated from denervated isoperfused rat small intestinal preparations (n = 39). Arterial and venous pressures, intestinal blood flow, and oxygen consumption were monitored. Animals were subjected to 15, 30, or 45 minutes of ischemia followed by 1 hour reperfusion. Experiments were performed without drug infusion or during intravenous glucagon administration (0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 micrograms/kg/min). After the rats were killed, histologic sections of intestine were graded 1 through 5 in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal villi and 5 = severe injury. Results (mean +/- SD) were analyzed by analysis of variance (*p less than 0.05). Glucagon at all concentrations increased intestinal blood flow and oxygen consumption before ischemia. For example, with 0.2 micrograms/kg/min glucagon, intestinal blood flow increased from 80.78 +/- 13.5 to 114.79 +/- 21.02 ml/min.100 gm* and oxygen consumption increased from 3.65 +/- 0.73 to 5.73 +/- 1.37 ml/min.100 gm.* Mucosal injury after ischemia reflected duration of ischemia and glucagon infusion rate. At all ischemic intervals, increased glucagon concentrations were associated with greater mucosal injury. In fact the histologic injury with 15 minutes of ischemia + 0.2 microgram/kg/min glucagon (3.04 +/- 0.49) exceeded that of 30 minutes of ischemia (2.87 +/- 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To identify patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy who are at high risk for cardiac events and death, we studied the course of 614 patients with known risk factors who were entered into our carotid follow-up registry. Patients were divided into two groups, group I with overt coronary disease (prior myocardial infarction, angina, significant electrocardiographic abnormalities) (N = 324) and group II without overt coronary disease (N = 290). Group II patients were subdivided into groups with (IIA) (N = 206) and without (IIB) (N = 84) coronary risk factors (cigarettes, diabetes, or hyperlipidemias). Thirty-day, 5-, 10-, and 15-year life-table survival for the groups was: I = 98.5%, 68.6%, 44.9%, 36.4%, respectively; II = 100%, 86.4%, 72.3%, 54.3%, respectively; IIA = 100%, 84.8%, 66.9%, 41.5%, respectively; IIB = 100%, 90.5%, 87.9%, 87.9%, respectively. Overt coronary disease was associated with diminished 30-day (p = 0.03) and late (p less than 0.0001) survival. Risk factors in the absence of overt disease were not associated with diminished 30-day survival. Late survival up to 3 years from endarterectomy was similar in groups IIA and IIB, but later survival was diminished in group IIA. Myocardial infarction was the most frequent cause of death in all groups. Patients with overt coronary disease are at high risk for late cardiac events and death. Patients without overt disease are at less risk than those with overt disease, and in the absence of overt disease, those without are at less risk than those with risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To investigate this question, we studied 52 patients surviving 1 year or more after surgical interruption of the infrarenal aorta in the course of treatment of aortic graft infection. Blood pressure, renal function, and renal artery anatomy were studied before and after aortic interruption. Preoperatively, 20 patients (38.4%) had treated hypertension, and 11 (21.2%) had impaired renal function (creatinine greater than 1.3 mg/dl). In 46 patients (88.4%) with angiography before aortic interruption, 31 (67.4%) had normal renal arteries, whereas 15 (32.6%) demonstrated renal artery stenosis of less than or equal to 50% (N = 10) or greater than 50% (N = 9). Concomitant renal revascularization (N = 3) or nephrectomy (N = 1) were rare. All patients were monitored after surgery for a mean period of 39.2 months. Thirty-three (63.5%) remain alive and well; 19 (36.5%) have died of causes not related (N = 15) or indirectly related (N = 4) to the original graft infection.

Follow-up aortography in 21 patients (40.4%, mean interval of 27.7 months) demonstrated no instance of suprarenal propagation of aortic thrombus.

    "abstract": "From January 1980 through December 1988, 564 limbs in 434 patients were treated for infrainguinal arterial ischemia. Of these, 516 limbs in 387 patients underwent reversed vein bypass grafting. The remainder were treated by primary amputation (11 limbs, 1.9%) or by prosthetic bypass (37 limbs, 6.4%). The indications for operation were limb salvage in 80% of limbs and claudication in 20%. Adequate ipsilateral greater saphenous vein was available for 285 (55%) grafts, with reversed vein bypass achieved in the other 231 operations by use of distal graft origins (151 grafts), use of alternate vein sources (120 grafts), and splicing of venous segments (81 grafts). Seventy-six grafts (15%) were to the above-knee popliteal artery, 199 grafts (37%) were to the below-knee popliteal artery, and 241 grafts (47%) were to infrapopliteal arteries, 26 of which (11%) were to inframalleolar arteries. The primary and secondary patencies for all grafts at 5 years were 75% and 81%, respectively. Grafts to infrapopliteal arteries had significantly worse primary patency (69%) at 5 years than did grafts to the popliteal artery (77%, above knee; 80%, below knee) and grafts formed of adequate ipsilateral greater saphenous vein had significantly better primary patency (80%) than did grafts performed when this conduit was not available (68%). Secondary patency of all graft categories ranged from 76% to 85%, and there were no significant differences regardless of site of distal anastomosis, source of venous conduit, or site of graft origins. We prefer the use of reversed vein bypass grafting for lower extremity revascularization both because of the excellent patency results and because the technique can be applied to the larger number of patients in our practice who lack intact ipsilateral greater saphenous vein, in contrast to in situ vein bypass procedures.",

    "abstract": "Prospective cost and reimbursement data were collected from 10 centers in various parts of the United States on 566 patients undergoing lower extremity arterial reconstructions for limb salvage and nonlimb salvage indications. Information for each patient was available on indication and type of procedure, length of stay, the type of hospital insurance, and hospital costs/charges. Diagnosis related group payments from each center were used to determine net gain or loss for each patient. Patients were classified as having claudication or critical ischemia (limb salvage). Reimbursements matched costs/charges for the claudication group; overall mean loss in this group was only $915 per patient. However, all centers had important losses in the limb salvage group. Reimbursements averaged 60% of costs/charges, with a mean loss of $8158 per patient and an overall loss for all 10 centers of $3,653,918. An effort to remedy this inequity is progressing via a dialogue between representatives of the Society for Vascular Surgery, the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, and the federal government.",

    "abstract": "A canine model was developed to study the differential response of a gram-negative and a gram-positive bacterial infection on autogenous and prosthetic grafts. After replacing segments of the femoral arteries of 15 dogs with autogenous vein in one groin and polytetrafluoroethylene in the contralateral groin, 10(8) colony-forming units of nonmucin-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (five dogs), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five dogs), or sterile saline solution (five dogs) were directly inoculated onto the grafts. The grafts were examined 7 to 10 days after implantation. None of the control dogs exhibited inflammatory signs, and no grafts or anastomoses disrupted. S. epidermidis was unrecoverable from either graft material in any of the animals, although histologic evaluation confirmed neutrophils and bacteria in four of five animals in the vein and polytetrafluoroethylene groups. No dog inoculated with S. epidermidis had graft or anastomotic disruption. By contrast, P. aeruginosa was recovered from both types of grafts in all inoculated animals. Neutrophils, bacteria, and microabscesses were observed in all of these animals. In addition, three of five polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and all five vein grafts disrupted either at the anastomoses or in the body of the vein graft. Therefore S. epidermidis is a less virulent organism that may persist in graft walls despite negative cultures, whereas P. aeruginosa is a highly virulent organism that can disrupt native artery, vein grafts, and anastomoses. The graft material appears to be less important than the bacteria in determining the outcome of infection.",

The presentation and clinical course of our patients recently treated are presented, and perioperative care and immunosuppressive management are outlined.

    "abstract": "Edema of a lower extremity after femoropopliteal bypass surgery is a common problem. To study the causes of this phenomenon we evaluated 72 patients before and after surgery with noninvasive venous testing and venography. We also obtained postoperative lymphangiograms of a sample of 16 patients, eight with and eight without postoperative edema. Patients were sequentially assigned to one of four treatment groups: group A, a lymphatic-preserving inguinal dissection with conventional popliteal dissection; group B, a lymphatic-preserving popliteal dissection with conventional inguinal dissection; group C, lymphatic-preserving inguinal and popliteal dissections; group D, conventional inguinal and popliteal dissections. Twenty-nine (40%) of the 72 patients had postoperative edema. A similar proportion of patients with edema had deep venous thrombosis as patients without edema (3/29 [10%] vs 3/43 [7%], respectively). Patients in group D showed the highest incidence of edema, 17/20 or 85%, a rate significantly higher than the rates in the other three groups (p less than 0.001). Results of lymphangiograms were normal in six of the eight patients without edema (the other two had slight disruption), whereas they showed severe lymphatic disruption in all eight patients with edema. No association was found between edema and type of graft used or severity of preoperative symptoms. This study indicates that deep venous thrombosis is not an important cause of edema that occurs after bypass surgery and that intraoperative lymphatic disruption probably causes most cases of this complication.",

    "abstract": "The lower extremity may be exposed to prolonged periods of ischemia, resulting in depletion of intracellular energy stores in the affected skeletal muscle. The role of adenine nucleotide reduction and failure of resynthesis on reperfusion in determining the extent of muscle necrosis was investigated in this study, in addition to the possible beneficial effects of the addition of exogenous adenosine triphosphate-magnesium chloride during early reperfusion. The isolated paired canine gracilis muscle model was used. After 4 hours of normothermic ischemia in group I, a perfusate Krebs-Henseleit solution plus the gradual reintroduction of oxygenated blood flow was compared to standard reperfusion. In group II, a similar infusion protocol was used, with the addition of 2 mmol/L adenosine triphosphate-magnesium chloride and compared to normal reperfusion. Adenosine triphosphate-magnesium chloride resulted in the salvage of skeletal muscle, 57% +/- 12% versus 44% +/- 14% (p less than 0.05, n = 6 pairs). Reperfusion with the solution alone increased the resulting necrosis (42% +/- 13% vs 60% +/- 20%, n = 6 pairs). Adenine nucleotide stores were not increased, but oxygen consumption was increased by magnesium chloride-adenosine triphosphate (p less than 0.05, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). A clear relationship was demonstrated between the fall in energy stores, as measured by a change in energy charge potential from preischemia to end ischemia levels, and the extent of resulting necrosis (p less than 0.01). In summary, the addition of 2 mmol/L to an infusion of Krebs-Henseleit solution during reperfusion results in significant salvage of skeletal muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to evaluate the photoplethysmographic technique in venous disease, especially regarding the effect of different positions of the photoplethysmographic transducer and the possibility of measuring regional changes in venous circulation. For this purpose photoplethysmographic recovery times were assessed from three different parts of the lower leg, that is, anterior midcalf level, medial midcalf level, and medial malleolar level. In patients with documented venous disease, regional photoplethysmographic findings were compared with results from venous pressure measurements, ascending/descending phlebography, foot volumetry, venous plethysmography, and Doppler investigation of the anterior tibial veins. The best correlation with pressure and volume recordings at the foot was obtained at the medial malleolar level. Only photoplethysmographic recovery times recorded at the anterior aspect of the leg were influenced by reflux in the anterior tibial veins. The present results indicate that photoplethysmographic recovery times reflect regional venous hemodynamics rather than overall venous hemodynamics in the limb. Photoplethysmographic recovery times were also found to be more related to superficial than to deep venous insufficiency. The results might have clinical implications when evaluating patients with regional venous dysfunction and in follow-up studies after venous surgery.",

    "abstract": "We have previously described a technique for intrathecal administration of papaverine and cerebrospinal fluid drainage to prevent paraplegia after aortic surgery. Herein we report the cerebrospinal fluid and hemodynamic alterations that occurred in 11 patients who had 30 mg of a specially prepared papaverine hydrochloride 10% dextrose solution injected before aortic cross-clamping and also had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. A mean of 26.6 ml (SD +/- 7.1 ml) was drained before and 34.6 ml (SD +/- 24.1 ml) was drained during aortic cross-clamping. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure increased significantly with anesthetic induction (p less than 0.03), during the period between anesthetic induction and cerebrospinal fluid drainage (p less than 0.005), and with aortic cross-clamping (p less than 0.05). These cerebrospinal fluid pressure alterations were similar to central venous pressure increases with a significant linear correlation between cerebral spinal fluid pressure and central venous pressure before anesthetic induction (r2 = 0.81, p less than 0.005), and both before (r2 = 0.94, p less than 0.005) and after (r2 = 0.74, p less than 0.005) aortic cross-clamping. As expected, cerebrospinal fluid pressure was significantly reduced by cerebrospinal fluid drainage before aortic cross-clamping (p less than 0.001). The administration of intrathecal papaverine had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, nor the pH of cerebrospinal fluid. Neither were there any complications noted related to the technique. All the patients survived, and no new immediate postoperative paraparesis or paraplegia occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The levels of esterified cholesterol and free cholesterol were higher in the internal mammary artery than in the saphenous vein (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively), but lower than the levels reported in previous studies for coronary arteries. The amount of collagen was higher in the saphenous vein (p less than 0.001). Heparan sulfate was the major glycosaminoglycan fraction in the internal mammary artery, probably reflecting the higher cellularity and thicker media in the arterial rather than in the venous tissue. The level of dermatan sulfate was higher (p less than 0.001) in the saphenous vein than in the internal mammary artery. This difference is in a direction that could favor atherogenesis in the saphenous vein graft.",

    "abstract": "In 31 patients with unilateral primary varicose veins the resting interstitial pressure in the deep posterior compartment of the leg was measured in three groups: I, asymptomatic; II, symptomatic; III, symptomatic with trophic changes. Spinal anesthesia was induced in all patients, and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) catheters were inserted into the deep posterior compartment of both legs. The interstitial pressure was recorded with a bioelectronic strain-guage pressure monitor with the patient in the horizontal position with complete muscle relaxation. In control legs (n = 31) mean pressure was -2.48 mm Hg (range -5 to 1). However, the measurement in affected legs (n = 31) was significantly higher at 4.61 mm Hg (range 1 to 12). Results demonstrate the following: (1) Primary varicose veins (an exclusively epifascial abnormality) were consistently associated with an increased resting interstitial pressure of the subfascial tissues in the supramalleolar area of the leg. (b) The subfascial resting interstitial pressure was elevated in all stages of varicose veins, even those with short duration of the disease and with no symptoms at all. (c) In all three groups there was a significant increase in the subfascial interstitial pressure between the affected and contralateral extremity. In patients with trophic changes (group III) this increase was significantly higher than in the remaining groups, although there was no significant difference between the increased pressure of the remaining groups (groups I & II).",

    "abstract": "The anatomy, valvular function, and reflux patterns in the deep veins of the lower extremities were studied by ascending and descending phlebography in 126 limbs with nonthrombotic deep venous incompetence. The most common patterns were isolated reflux in the superficial femoral vein (51%), and combined reflux in the superficial femoral and the deep femoral veins (44%). Isolated deep femoral vein reflux occurred in 5%. As the degree of reflux in this vein varied considerably, a grading system for classification of deep femoral vein reflux was proposed. Depending on variations in the deep femoral vein anatomy, four different patterns could be distinguished. This study demonstrated that contrast filling of the deep femoral vein during ascending phlebography may indicate the presence of reflux in this vein. Complete visualization of the deep femoral vein is a new diagnostic sign that strongly correlates (p less than 0.001) with reflux in the deep femoral vein. The mean number of valves in the superficial femoral vein was reduced with increasing degree of reflux compared with a reference group consisting of 41 extremities without reflux. The diameter of the popliteal vein was significantly increased in the presence of pathologic reflux, which may indicate that vein wall dilation is a major cause of primary nonthrombotic deep venous incompetence.",

    "abstract": "This study compared four brands of balloon embolectomy catheters with respect to their mechanical characteristics and the histologic responses they elicit. Seventy-two 4F Becton-Dickinson, Edwards, Electro-Catheter, and Shiley catheters were studied. In vitro studies of penetration forces demonstrated that the forces required for arterial puncture were greatest for Shiley (295 +/- 22 gm) and least for Edwards catheter tips (217 +/- 11 gm) (p less than 0.05). This indicates that the Shiley catheter is least likely to puncture vessels in patients. Studies of balloon eccentricity showed that none of the balloons distended with excessive eccentricity. Studies of balloon emptying time demonstrated that the silicon Becton-Dickinson balloon required more than two times as long (5.7 +/- 1.2 seconds) as all other balloons to empty. Balloon emptying time reflects the ability of the surgeon to rapidly adapt the balloon to changing vessel diameter in patients. Shear forces were studied in cylindrical segments of arteries in vitro. Initial shear forces were significantly different among all catheters, Becton-Dickinson greater than Edwards greater than Shiley greater than Electro-Catheter (p less than 0.05). In contrast, during catheter withdrawal dynamic shear forces were similar among the four brands of catheters. Balloon embolectomies were performed in vivo in the common carotid and common femoral arteries in 18 anesthetized dogs. Histologic examinations of the vessels exposed to 50, 100, and 200 gm shear forces showed that myointimal hyperplasia increased with rising shear forces for all catheters (p less than 0.05), but that there were no differences in the degree of myointimal hyperplasia elicited by the different brands of catheters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Encouraged by results from our research laboratory and from recent clinical reports, we performed reconstructions of the vena cava and/or its major tributaries on 16 patients (11 males and five females). Ages ranged from 8 to 81 years (median, 38 years). Eight patients had superior vena cava syndrome (benign, six; malignant, two). Two other patients had membranous occlusion of the inferior vena cava; four had iliocaval venous thrombosis; one had excision of the iliac veins for pelvic neurilemmoma; and one had inferior vena cava injury during orthotopic liver transplantation. The superior vena cava was reconstructed with spiral saphenous vein grafts in five patients and with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in three. One spiral saphenous vein graft and one expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft required revision; seven of the eight grafts were patent at follow-up, but one bifurcated spiral saphenous vein graft occluded at 3 months. The inferior vena cava and its tributaries were reconstructed with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in five patients, spiral saphenous vein graft in two, and Dacron in one. At follow-up four of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were patent. In contrast, one of the spiral saphenous vein grafts was occluded, and results of imaging studies of the other were inconclusive. Three of the five expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts had a concomitant temporary arteriovenous fistula at the groin; two had documented patency at follow-up. At the present time, spiral saphenous vein graft is our first choice for superior vena cava replacement. However, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts are good alternatives and in the abdomen appear to perform better than spiral saphenous vein graft. These clinical results encourage us to perform further caval grafting in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Since surgical endarterectomy produces a highly thrombogenic vascular flow surface, we evaluated in baboons the capacity of acutely attached, unspread, cultured, homologous aortic endothelial cells to form durable, confluent endothelial cell monolayers and to interrupt acute thrombus formation during exposure to arterial blood flow conditions. When cultured baboon aortic endothelial cells were incubated with segments of freshly endarterectomized baboon aorta for 20 minutes in vitro, 3.8 x 10(5) endothelial cells/cm2 became attached. The endarterectomized surface treated with endothelial cells showed the presence of rounded, unspread endothelial cells with intervening bare areas of vascular media. Platelet deposition onto the endothelial cell--treated surface during exposure to blood under high flow conditions for 1 hour in vivo was markedly reduced by the attached but unspread endothelial cells. Moreover, these attached endothelial cells underwent spreading on the endarterectomized surface in the presence of high shear blood flow to form a confluent endothelial monolayer at the end of 1 hour. Thus acutely attached cultured endothelial cells form a durable thromboresistant monolayer on surgically denuded vascular surfaces during exposure to arterial blood flow.",

    "abstract": "To determine the influence of unrepaired technical defects as well as systemic risk factors for atherogenesis on carotid artery healing after endarterectomy, we conducted a prospective study using intraoperative duplex scanning with spectral analysis to establish the initial status of the artery (N = 131 arteries), and then we studied these vessels at regular postoperative intervals with the same technique (N = 108 arteries, 265 studies). The vessels were divided into the operated and nonoperated segments of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries, and both intraoperative image and flow data were tabulated by artery segment. The technical factors that were analyzed included defect size, defect type, adjacent segment defects, number of defects, shunt use, vessel reopening, and peak, mean, and end-diastolic frequency and velocity. The systemic risk factors studied were sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, randomly drawn total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and perioperative aspirin and dextran use. Data were analyzed by linear logistic regression analysis. Among the technical factors, only intraoperative defect size was significantly associated with risk of recurrent stenosis (p = 0.0175). Although any defect size adversely affected the condition of the vessel during follow-up, the magnitude of this effect was small for smaller defects (size category 1: less than or equal to 40% stenosis or flap length less than or equal to 25% of vessel diameter). The systemic factors that were associated with risk of recurrent stenosis were hypertension (p = 0.0002), smoking (p = 0.0016), and randomly drawn total serum cholesterol level (p = 0.0116). The fact that the operated segments consistently fared worse during follow-up than did the nonoperated segments (p = 0.0044) undoubtedly reflects the inevitable trauma of the endarterectomy, but also emphasizes the important contribution of systemic risk factors in recurrent carotid stenosis. Risk factor modification may be the most effective method of ensuring the durability of carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "The addition of an endothelial cell lining to a prosthetic vascular graft may reduce the thrombogenicity of the blood-contacting surface. An endothelialized mesoatrial graft was implanted in a patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by a primary inferior vena caval leiomyosarcoma. During the initial surgery a Dacron vascular graft was preclotted with plasma and then lined with microvascular endothelial cells derived from the patient's subcutaneous adipose tissue. The patient did well initially but 9 months later required resection of a mechanical stricture of the graft that occurred as it passed beneath the costochondral junction. Grossly, the luminal surface of the resected graft was free of thrombus, with a smooth, glistening, white surface. Light microscopy demonstrated a surface layer of cells morphologically consistent with an endothelial cell monolayer, a subendothelial layer composed of extracellular matrix and spindle-shaped cells, and granulation tissue around the Dacron fabric. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy confirmed the presence of vascular endothelium on the luminal surface. This report documents the successful achievement of a human endothelial cell monolayer that persisted for 9 months in the midportion of a Dacron vascular graft.",

    "abstract": "Sealed rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if uncommon, deserves particular attention for the possibility of misdiagnosis and for the deleterious effects of such a misdiagnosis. Sixteen patients (mean age 72 years; range 65 to 84 years) with chronic sealed rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms are reported. Two patients had acute rupture of the aneurysm, and at operation chronic contained rupture was found along with the recent hemorrhage. One patient died after surgery. The remaining patients underwent successful resection with long-term survival and regression of symptoms. Consideration of sealed abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture should be included when examining elderly patients with history of unexplained back pain or femoral neuropathy. Computed tomography is a useful aid in the diagnosis of sealed rupture. Ultrasonography is less accurate; in three patients ultrasonography failed to diagnose the presence of the rupture.",

    "abstract": "Vascular prostheses in humans do not endothelialize spontaneously. In the present study we explored the feasibility of seeding autologous endothelial cells into prostheses implanted in patients undergoing reconstruction of the infrarenal aorta. In 22 patients one limb of an aortic Dacron bifurcation prosthesis was seeded with autologous endothelial cells harvested from the distal portion of the saphenous vein. The other limb was sham-seeded with culture medium only. The effect of seeding was studied by use of indium 111 radiolabeled platelets and external gamma camera scanning at 1, 4, and 12 months after surgery. No complications ascribable to the seeding procedure were seen. During the first year after surgery a gradual decrease in platelet accumulation occurred over the whole vascular prosthesis. At all time points studied the seeded graft limbs exhibited significantly less deposition of radiolabeled platelets than did control limbs. The observed difference in platelet accumulation on autologous endothelial seeding-treated graft segments merits further investigation of this technique in humans.",

    "abstract": "We report seven cases of dissection of the abdominal aorta. Three patients had acute back pain, whereas four patients had more chronic courses. In six cases, as a result of the palpation of a pulsatile abdominal mass, clinical diagnosis was an atheromatous aneurysm. Angiography and CT scanning demonstrated a dissected abdominal aorta and a normal thoracic aorta. Six patients with an infrarenal dissection were treated by replacement of the aorta with a Dacron prothesis, and one patient with an suprarenal dissection was treated conservatively. With a mean follow-up of 3 years, all patients were alive and free of symptoms. These results favor graft replacement in case of infrarenal aortic dissection and more selective surgical indications in suprarenal aortic dissection.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous insufficiency is a frequent sequel to lower extremity venous thrombosis. A relatively uncommon, but potentially lethal, cause of the thrombosis is congenital antithrombin III deficiency. Recognition and treatment of this occult deficiency is critical. The following report describes a family treated by the authors for this problem. In one generation of nine siblings, three males had documentation of the disease with functional antithrombin III levels in the range of 50% to 60%. Before evaluation for the deficiency one female sibling died at the age of 20 years as a consequence of a proven pulmonary embolus. Antithrombin III levels in another female sibling, who was free of symptoms, were normal (80% to 120%). Four other siblings who were free of symptoms (one female, three males) refused evaluation. All three men with the deficiency had severe, chronic, bilateral, lower extremity, venous insufficiency manifested by pain, varicosities, edema, pigmentation, and ulceration. Despite chronic warfarin therapy, one experienced recurrent pulmonary embolization with eventual loss of perfusion of the entire right lung. Ascending venography in the symptomatic males with the deficiency revealed evidence of recurrent and diffuse venous thrombosis with partial recanalization. Recurrent lower extremity venous thrombosis consequent to antithrombin III deficiency causes a particularly fulminant postphlebitic syndrome with characteristic venographic findings. Although potentially lethal if unrecognized and treated simply as venous insufficiency, chronic therapy with warfarin offers palliation and prolongs life.",

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation resulting in intimal hyperplasia is a major cause of late graft failure. In baboons, healing 60 microns internodal distance polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts form an intima composed of proliferating smooth muscle cells with a luminal lining of endothelium. The presence of intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation underneath an intact endothelium, without platelet adherence, suggests that intimal cells rather than platelets may provide the growth factors regulating the smooth muscle cell proliferation. This idea is supported by the observation that, when segments of graft and artery are excised and perfused ex vivo, there is greater mitogenic activity present in the graft perfusate compared to artery perfusate. Two factors expressed by vascular wall cells and known to influence smooth muscle cell growth in vitro are platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta 1. The expression of these growth factors was measured by Northern blot analysis of total ribonucleic acid extracted from thoracic aorta and the intima of 6-week thoracoabdominal polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, and from smooth muscle cell cultured from the aorta and polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Growth of the cultured smooth muscle cell was arrested in serum-free conditions for 3 days and then stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours later, the smooth muscle cells were harvested. Probing the blots for platelet-derived growth factor-A, platelet-derived growth factor-B, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid revealed that in vivo, the graft intima expressed more platelet-derived growth factor-A than the aorta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Ankle ulcers associated with venous disease have been traditionally treated by Unna's compressive bandages. However, successful healing of an ulcer with this therapeutic modality is slow and tedious. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether adjunctive sclerotherapy of large venous channels near the ulcers enhances healing. Twenty-eight patients with perimalleolar venous ulceration were entered into this study. Ulcer size ranged from 6.0 to 25 cm2. All were examined for the presence of large venous channels adjacent to the ulcer bed. A portable continuous-wave Doppler supplemented digital examination of the area. Twenty-five out of 28 patients had easily detectable venous channels, and these were randomized into two groups: group I, treated by weekly changes of Unna's compressive boots; group II, treated by weekly change of Unna's compressive boots and sclerotherapy with 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol). All patients had the size of the ulcer measured during their weekly visits. Patients in group II took a mean of 2.1 weeks to exhibit 50% healing and 4.3 weeks to fully heal. Conversely patients in group I took a mean of 3.2 weeks to achieve 50% healing and 6.1 weeks to fully heal. Thus, healing was significantly faster (p less than 0.05) in group II. In conclusion, the therapeutic efficiency of Unna's compressive bandaging is significantly enhanced by the adjunctive sclerotherapy of adjacent venous channels.",

    "abstract": "The mortality of acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion and mesenteric infarction remains high, in part because of the failure to identify the patients with the disorder. A reliable noninvasive diagnostic study may facilitate earlier definitive diagnosis and therapy. Proton magnetic resonance imaging may offer a noninvasive diagnostic alternative. We examined this possibility by using an experimental rabbit model of acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion in this study. Animals were scanned 1 hour after the ischemic insult. Relative intestinal wall signal intensity was increased in experimental (ischemic) animals when compared to sham operated controls on T2-weighted (4.35 +/- 0.5 vs 2.57 +/- 0.31, p less than 0.02) and proton spin density-weighted images (2.1 +/- 0.2 vs 1.4 +/- 0.21, p less than 0.05). Significant increases in image intensity were found on T2-weighted and proton spin density images when compared to control animals. Differences between groups could be further highlighted after the administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent gadolinium diethyltriamine pentacetic acid on T1-weighted images. The data from this preliminary study demonstrate that proton magnetic resonance imaging may be used to discriminate between ischemic and nonischemic small intestine. This noninvasive tool may someday become clinically useful to enhance our diagnostic capabilities when a diagnosis of acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion is being entertained.",

    "abstract": "Indications for arteriography in patients with penetrating trauma to the extremities remain controversial. Some clinicians have recommended universal use of arteriography, whereas others prefer to rely on physical findings alone. To better define our indications for contrast studies, we reviewed clinical data on 306 patients (349 extremities) with penetrating trauma who were admitted during a prior 2-year period (1985 to 1987). Injuries were caused by stab wounds in 50 (14.3%) extremities and by gunshot wounds in 299 (85.7%) extremities. Twenty-seven of the 50 stab wounds (54%) required urgent exploration based on physical findings, whereas 23 underwent arteriography. None of these studies showed unsuspected arterial injury. Twenty-nine of 299 gunshot wounds (9.7%) underwent mandatory exploration, and arteriograms were performed on 270 extremities; findings in 30 studies (11.1%) were positive for unsuspected arterial injuries. Gunshot wounds were categorized according to location and number of arteriograms with positive results. Arteriograms of lateral thigh and upper arm injuries resulted in no positive outcomes. Positive study results were recorded in 22.9% of calf injuries, 20% of forearm and antecubital injuries, 9.5% of popliteal fossa injuries, 9.0% of medial and posterior thigh injuries, and 8.3% of medial and posterior upper arm injuries. We recommend arteriography for penetrating injuries to these high-risk areas. However, clinical evaluation alone is accurate for identification of arterial trauma with lateral thigh or upper arm wounds and stab wounds to the extremities.",

    "abstract": "We retrospectively studied the arteriograms of 135 men admitted for evaluation of lower extremity ischemia to examine whether race influences the severity of infragenicular occlusive disease. The scoring system prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards for the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery was used to grade the severity of stenosis in each of the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal arteries (collectively called \"infragenicular\" arteries). The patients were divided into two groups: 83 blacks (140 arteriogram limbs) and 52 whites (87 arteriogram limbs). Disease severity scores between the groups were compared, and the existence of five known risk factors for atherosclerosis were considered for poststratification adjustment. Results showed that higher disease scores, indicating more severe disease, were found in the black population in every segment of the infragenicular arteries. The mean (+/- SE) score for all the infragenicular segments in blacks was significantly higher than that in the whites (2.08 +/- 0.05 vs 1.57 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.001). The black and white groups were comparable in terms of age (65.2 vs 64.6 years), prevalence of diabetes (20% vs 25%), smoking history (93% vs 90%), and hypercholesterolemia (51% vs 63%). Hypertension was more prevalent among the black patients (51% vs 27%, p less than 0.001). When only the non-hypertensive patients in both groups were considered, however; the mean severity score was still significantly higher in blacks (2.10 +/- 0.06 vs 1.42 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We reviewed 239 infrapopliteal reversed greater saphenous vein graft bypasses placed for critical ischemia over a 7-year period to determine the influence of vein diameter on graft patency and limb salvage. Grafts were assigned to four groups based on the minimum external diameter measured during operation: less than 3.0 mm, n = 18; 3.0 mm, n = 59; 3.5 mm, n = 67; and greater than or equal to 4.0 mm, n = 145. A pattern of increasing graft patency and limb salvage among the four groups was noted as the minimum external diameter increased from less than 3.0 mm to greater than or equal to 4.0 mm. When compared to the larger grafts greater than or equal to 4.0 mm, primary graft patency was significantly lower both for less than 3.0 mm grafts (0% for less than 3.0 mm vs 65% for greater than or equal to 4.0 mm at 3 years, p less than 0.001) and for long (greater than 45 cm) 3.0 mm grafts (38% for long 3.0 mm vs 75% for greater than or equal to 4.0 mm at 2 years, p less than 0.005). All 3.5 mm and short (less than 45 cm) 3.0 mm grafts had patency rates similar to greater than or equal to 4.0 mm veins. Thus long 3.0 mm and all less than 3.0 mm reversed saphenous vein grafts should be considered at high risk for failure. Veins with fibrotic, thick-walled segments identified during operation (n = 19) had patency rates significantly lower than nonfibrotic veins (n = 270; p less than 0.01), and this may play a role in the failure of some less than 3.0 mm minimum external diameter vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "Since approximately 30% to 40% of autogenous vein bypass grafts to the femoropopliteal level may occlude within 5 years of implantation, additional vein will be required for subsequent revisions. We undertook a study to determine whether the preferential use of an above-knee expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass graft to save vein is an appropriate option. We reviewed our experience with 114 above-knee expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass reconstructions. Life-table analysis of primary and secondary graft patency was carried out by the method of Peto and statistically analyzed for the influence of clinical indication, runoff as determined by both preoperative and intraoperative completion arteriography, smoking, and diabetes. The 5-year primary patency rate of 57% for patients with claudication was comparable to contemporary randomized or retrospective series with below-knee autogenous vein for that indication, and it was superior to the patency rate for limb salvage. The status of the runoff vessels was an important determinant of outcome. The 59 limbs with good arteriographic runoff (2 to 3 vessels) had a markedly higher 5-year patency rate (70%) than the poor arteriographic runoff (0 to 1 vessels) group (30%). Continued cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus also appeared to affect adversely primary graft patency in our hands. Our data support the use of preferential above-knee expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients with good angiographic runoff. This approach does not appear to prejudice the limb against secondary revisionary procedures or the use of a new autogenous graft, if required.",

    "abstract": "Associated coronary artery disease is the critical factor that influences early and late mortality after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. Dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy, left ventricular ejection fraction, and Goldman risk factor analysis have been suggested as preoperative noninvasive screening methods to detect significant coronary artery disease. In this series of 95 elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy was highly predictive of the absence of perioperative cardiac morbidity (96% specificity, 44/46 normal scans, no cardiac morbidity), whereas ejection fraction (73% specificity, 31/42 normal ejection fraction, no cardiac morbidity) and Goldman risk factor analysis (84% specificity, 44/51 class I, no cardiac morbidity) were less. Furthermore, thallium redistribution on dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy leading to coronary angiography identified a significant number of patients with occult coronary artery disease who required preoperative coronary revascularization (8%, 8/95) and might have remained undetected on the basis of left ventricular ejection fraction or Goldman risk factor analysis. Finally, fixed thallium deficit, which some investigators have interpreted as a low probability finding for cardiac morbidity, was associated with a higher than expected incidence of cardiac complications. Forty-six percent (7/15) of all postoperative cardiac complications (three myocardial infarctions, three ischemic events, one death) occurred in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms with fixed deficits. This suggests that patients with fixed deficits on dipyridamole-thallium 201 scintigraphy should be considered for later \"delayed\" (4 hours) thallium images or coronary angiography or both.",

    "abstract": "The 10-year experience of a single community was reviewed and a multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of clinical and environmental factors in mortality after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Ruptured aneurysms were repaired in 243 patients in six area hospitals (one university, five community) by 25 surgeons (16 vascular, 9 general). Overall, 30-day mortality was 55% (133/243). Although the mortality by hospital ranged from 44% to 68%, these differences were not statistically significant. However, significant variations occurred in the mortality rates of individual surgeons, ranging from 44% to 73%. The mortality rate for the vascular surgeons was less than that of the general surgeons, 51% versus 69% (p less than 0.05). Clinical factors were evaluated, and the most significant parameters were systolic blood pressure, presence of chronic obstructive lung disease, and history of chronic renal insufficiency. These results support the implication that the degree of specialization of the surgeon and the preexisting health of the patient are the most important determinants of survival after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The size and sophistication of the hospital appear to be less influential factors.",

    "abstract": "This study explores graft geometry and hemodynamics in a reproducible canine arteriovenous loop graft model of intimal-medial hyperplasia. Untapered 6 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (n = 10) were paired with 4 to 7 mm taper (n = 5) or 7 to 4 mm taper (n = 5) grafts for a 12-week period. Several hemodynamic variables were assessed at multiple locations, and venous intimal-medial thickness was measured at locations corresponding to the hemodynamic measurements. Color Doppler imaging demonstrated energy transfer out of the vessel in the form of perivascular tissue vibration. This was quantitated by the distance required for Doppler signal attenuation or volume of the detected vibration signal. Differences among graft types were noted for pressure, flow velocity, tissue vibration, and venous intimal-medial thickness. Hyperplasia was significantly decreased in 4 to 7 mm taper grafts. Stepwise deletion regression indicated volume of the vibration signal had a better correlation with venous intimal-medial thickness than any other variable (r 0.9, p less than 0.001). We conclude that graft geometry can have a significant impact on hemodynamic factors and venous intimal-medial hyperplasia in arteriovenous loop grafts. Flow disturbances appear to cause energy transfer through the vessel wall and into perivascular tissue. Kinetic energy transfer in the form of perivascular tissue vibration was quantitated in vivo and correlates strongly with venous intimal-medial thickness.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 100,000 total hip reconstructions are done annually in the United States. The nature of the surgical technique in a field close to the iliac and femoral vessels makes the occurrence of vascular injury an occasional but serious complications. We have reviewed retrospectively our experience of five cases of vascular injuries with total hip replacement and an additional 63 cases in the literature to identify those patients at risk and to define the management of these injuries. For the entire group of 68 patients, most injuries were sustained on the left side (66%), and 39% were seen in revisions. Complications were related to cement incorporation of the iliac vessels (44%), aggressive medial retraction (17%), excessive traction on atherosclerotic vessels (10%), and improper technique in preparation of the acetabulum. The most commonly injured vessels were the external iliac artery (36), common femoral artery (17), and external iliac vein (6). Twenty-seven of these injuries required emergent surgery, most for hemorrhage (66%). Injuries consisted of thromboembolic complications leading to distal ischemia (46%), vessel lacerations (26%), pseudoaneurysms (25%), and arteriovenous fistulas (3%). Vascular repair was individualized and included suture repair, thrombectomy and patch angioplasty, embolectomy, and arterial and venous bypass procedures. There was an overall 7% mortality and a 15% incidence of limb loss. Risk factors include (1) revision procedures, (2) left-sided procedures, and (3) intrapelvic migration of the acetabular component of the hip prosthesis. Elective vascular workup and preliminary retroperitoneal exposure of the iliac vessels at time of hip arthroplasty is recommended for patients at risk.",

    "abstract": "To further characterize the incidence and morbidity of recurrent carotid stenosis, we reviewed 184 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed in a university hospital between August 1983 and January 1988, in patients followed after operation with serial duplex ultrasonography. Recurrent stenosis of greater than 50% diameter reduction developed in eleven arteries (6.0%) at a mean interval of 10.2 +/- 7.8 months. Three of the eleven (1.6% of the total) had associated transient ischemic attack, and none had strokes. Restenosis was significantly more frequent in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients (13.3% vs 4.5%; p less than 0.05); and among patients whose primary stenoses had been symptomatic compared to asymptomatic (11.0% vs 1.5%; p less than 0.02). No statistically significant association with restenosis could be established for gender, hypertension, or smoking. Completion angiography and/or Doppler spectral analysis had been performed, and results were normal at the primary operation in 10 of the 11 patients. Only six of 184 arteries (3.3%) had vein patch closure, but none of these restenosed. Uneventful reoperation with patch closure was performed in three patients with transient ischemic attacks and two with preocclusive restenoses. Lesions were myointimal hyperplasia in four and atheroma in one. Three of the unoperated restenoses have shown regression on duplex scanning, but a fourth progressed to asymptomatic occlusion. Carotid restenosis is uncommon, even without routine use of vein patch angioplasty. Reoperation should be reserved for patients with associated symptoms or greater than 80% restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Arteriography and carotid duplex imaging accurately quantify the degree of stenosis caused by carotid atheroma. Since arteriography is inconsistent in identifying carotid ulceration, and controversy exists regarding the diagnostic accuracy of carotid B-mode imaging, a prospective study was performed comparing the two techniques to 126 carotid endarterectomy specimens. Sixty percent (76/126) of specimens contained ulcers. The diagnostic sensitivity for B-mode imaging and arteriography was 47% (36/76) and 53% (40/76), respectively (p = NS). Importantly, the degree of stenosis caused by the plaque significantly affected diagnostic sensitivities. B-mode sensitivity was 77% (10/13) in plaques less than or equal to 50% and 41% (26/63) for plaques greater than 50% (p = 0.03). Arteriography likewise detected 77% (10/13) of ulcers in plaques less than or equal to 50% stenosis and 48% (30/63) in plaques with greater than 50% stenosis (p = 0.07). In patients with focal symptoms, 100% (10/10) of plaques with less than or equal to 50% stenosis contained ulcers, whereas in plaques with greater than 50% stenosis 63% (36/57) contained ulcers (p = 0.02). These data indicate that the diagnostic sensitivity for carotid ulceration is not significantly different between B-mode carotid imaging and arteriography. Since most B-mode errors occur with high-grade stenoses this short-coming is unlikely to adversely affect patient care. Previous studies investigating the ability of carotid B-mode imaging to detect ulceration failed to address quantitative aspects of the carotid plaque. These data appear to resolve the previously existing controversy.",

    "abstract": "Complement activation by biomaterials may play an important role in vascular graft failure since the physiologically active polypeptides, C3a and C5a, have several relevant properties. C3a promotes platelet aggregation and release, and C5a activates neutrophils, which may stimulate platelet aggregation by liberation of platelet activating factor or by a direct neutrophil platelet interaction. Microscopic air bubbles (nuclei) are found in the surface roughness or pores of most biomaterials, and their number and size are related to the surface tension of the material. Therefore two interfaces can be postulated to exist when Dacron is exposed to blood: (1) a blood/biomaterial, and (2) a blood/air interface. These air nuclei in the surface and the biomaterial itself are capable of activating complement. The purpose of these experiments was to eliminate these surface nuclei from Dacron by a process termed denucleation and subsequently to determine the effect of this intervention on complement activation and platelet aggregation in vitro. Dacron was denucleated by pretreatment that involved serial rinsing with ethanol and degassed buffer that results in replacement of the air nuclei by buffer. Both control and denucleated pieces of Dacron (2, 4, and 6 cm2) were then incubated in human plasma. Each plasma sample was assayed for complement activation products (C3a, C5a, and C4a) by means of radioimmunoassays, and the degree of autologous platelet aggregation that resulted from the addition of a portion of each incubated plasma sample to an autologous platelet suspension was measured. There was a significant reduction in C3a and C5a in the plasma samples incubated with denucleated Dacron as compared to control Dacron (p less than 0.001, analysis of variance [ANOVA]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From July 1988 through December 1988 laser \"hot tip\" angioplasties coupled with balloon dilations were performed on 95 patients at the Union Memorial and University of Maryland hospitals. The patients ranged in age from 42 to 84 years (mean, 66.4 years), and there were 61 men and 34 women in the study. Indications for the procedure included claudication in 70 (74%) and severe ischemia in 25 (26%). Noninvasive studies were performed on all patients before and after the procedure. One hundred seventeen segments were treated in 28 iliac arteries and 89 superficial femoral/popliteal arteries. No tibial arteries were treated. Fifty-two stenoses and 65 occlusions occurred. The procedures were performed percutaneously in 52 patients (55%), and open surgical technique was used in 43 patients (45%). Nine immediate failures (9.5%) and 86 successes (90.5%) were noted within 24 hours of the procedure. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 months with a mean of 3.2 months. Late failures within this time period occurred in 21 patients (22%). The total failure rate was 30/95 or 31.5%. Only one of the patients was made worse by a failed laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Immediate complications consisted of formation of subcutaneous hematoma in 20 of the 52 patients having percutaneous procedures (38%) and healing difficulty in 3 of the 43 patients having open surgical procedures (7%). Hospital stay was usually 1 day longer in the latter group. No patient required surgical intervention for bleeding as a result of a vessel perforation. However, this phenomenon was noted during the course of three superficial femoral artery laser-assisted balloon angioplasties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In the last 10 years we have treated 28 patients with 33 groin infections involving a common femoral artery anastomosis of prosthetic arterial grafts (2 aortic Dacron grafts, 31 peripheral polytetrafluoroethylene grafts). Management included complete graft preservation for patent infected grafts (11 cases), subtotal excision of occluded infected grafts leaving an oversewn 2 to 3 mm graft remnant attached to a patent artery critical for limb survival (16 cases), and total graft excision with arterial oversewing or ligation for anastomotic bleeding (6 cases). Essential treatment adjuncts included (1) radical operative wound debridement, and (2) secondary revascularization by means of bypasses tunneled via lateral uninfected routes, and unusual approaches to uninvolved patent outflow arteries (i.e., the distal superficial or deep femoral or popliteal arteries) after isolation of the infected wound. Follow-up averaged 3 years (1 to 10 years). This plan of treatment resulted in an 11% (3/28) hospital mortality and an amputation rate of 13% (4/30 threatened limbs). Of the 25 survivors with 30 infected groin grafts, 87% (26) of the wounds healed uneventfully by secondary intention within 1 to 8 weeks (mean, 4 weeks) and have remained healed. One infected groin wound did not heal and required delayed total graft excision. Three patients had late anastomotic disruption with hemorrhage at 8 months, 2 years, and 4 years after initial treatment. This selected use of complete or partial graft preservation and other essential treatment adjuncts are proposed as a safer, easier method for managing infected prosthetic arterial grafts in the groin.",

    "abstract": "Protein adsorption on the surfaces of clinically significant prosthetic vascular graft materials from human whole blood was independent of plasma concentration as determined morphologically by use of immunogold labels. Some proteins, such as fibrinogen, adsorbed in a multilayer pattern on expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and had a preference for particular surface features of the polymer. Other proteins, such as Hageman factor (factor XII), showed diffuse adsorption patterns. Physiologically significant proteins that have not been well studied, such as immunoglobulin G and factor VIII, adsorbed readily to the surface of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. This finding may be significant since adsorbed proteins may activate coagulation mechanisms and immunologic responses, including platelet and monocyte adhesion and activation. Any human blood protein for which an antibody has been developed can be studied by use of this technique.",

    "abstract": "Anastomoses welded by laser have been strengthened by applying a solder of fibrinogen combined with a laser energy absorbing dye (indocyanine green, maximum absorbance 805 nm) to the anastomotic site before continuous-wave diode laser exposure (808 +/- 1 nm, 4.8 W/cm2). Immediately after creation, the bursting pressures of welds created without fibrinogen (262 +/- 29 mm Hg, n = 11) were significantly less than repairs with fibrinogen (330 +/- 75 mm Hg, n = 11) (p less than 0.05). When repairs performed with fibrinogen were exposed to urokinase (25,000 IU) the bursting pressures were not significantly different from baseline (290 +/- 74 mm Hg, n = 5). Aortotomies closed by suture did not burst but leaked at pressures significantly below those of vessels closed by laser (165 +/- 9 mm Hg, n = 11) (p less than 0.01). Twenty-two repairs soldered with fibrinogen were incorporated into survival studies in rabbits and examined from 1 to 90 days after operation. No anastomotic ruptures, thromboses, or aneurysms were identified. Soldered sites rapidly regenerated a new intimal surface and healed by myofibroblast proliferation. No significant foreign body response was identified; the fibrinogen was resorbed. Laser soldering with exogenous fibrinogen is feasible without topical administration of additional clotting agents, significantly improves the bursting strength of primary laser welded anastomoses, and appears to result from urokinase-resistant fibrinogen cross-linking.",

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition. Aggressive hypotensive drug therapy is the initial treatment of choice, although emergent surgical intervention is often warranted. We evaluated the efficacy of a balloon-expandable intravascular stent for the internal obliteration of aortic dissection. It is a flexible, continuous, complex coil cut to the length needed at the time of insertion. It can be positioned in curved vessels, including the aortic arch. The stent was inserted in the thoracic and abdominal aorta of 12 dogs (group I). Six weeks after implantation the dogs underwent angiography and the stents were explanted for light and scanning electron microscopy. There were no instances of stent migration or change in configuration. The aortas did not rupture. All branch vessels remained patent. Light and scanning electron microscopy illustrated neointimal incorporation into the vascular wall except at orifices. Thoracic dissections were created surgically in an additional 24 mongrel dogs. Twelve dogs received stents immediately after creation of the dissection (group II). All 12 dissections were obliterated. Twelve dogs were allowed to recover after creation of the dissection to observe the natural history of that lesion (group III). Within 1 week, in group III, there were three deaths because of aortic rupture; eight dissections persisted, and one resealed spontaneously. Stents were placed in the eight persistent dissections. All eight dissections were obliterated. In both groups, after 6 weeks of stent placement, aortography was repeated, and stents were explanted for light and scanning electron microscopy. There were no instances of rupture. All branch vessels remained patent with no evidence of thrombosis. We conclude that because of its unique characteristics, the stent effectively obliterates the false lumen of experimental acute aortic dissections without occlusing side branches, damaging the aorta, or inducing thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of diagnostic angiograms and interventional vascular procedures has resulted in a heightened awareness of serious catheter-related vascular trauma. We reviewed 50 consecutive catheter injuries of the femoral artery that required surgical intervention and focused specifically on their long-term outcome. The most common traumatic lesion was femoral pseudoaneurysm (60%) followed by uncontrolled hemorrhage (23%) and arterial thrombosis (17%). The most frequent chronic complaint of these patients was the femoral neuralgia syndrome affecting 15 of 50 patients (30%). Typically, these patients complained of postcatheterization pain in the groin, which radiated down the anteromedial thigh (anterior femoral cutaneous nerves), and was associated with residual hyperesthesias. The neuralgia gradually improved in 6 weeks to 1 year in most patients. Chronic pain, however, necessitated multiple visits to a pain clinic or physical therapy unit in four patients (27%) and resulted in unemployment in three (20%). We conclude that current catheter-related arterial injuries are commonly associated with a chronic femoral cutaneous neuralgia syndrome that has not been emphasized previously.",

    "abstract": "Recent clinical reports have suggested that drainage of cerebrospinal fluid lowers the incidence of perioperative paraplegia in patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Unfortunately, the precise mechanisms for both the neurologic deficits and the beneficial effects of cerebrospinal fluid drainage remain unclear. To better understand the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid pressure, central venous pressure, and the compliance of the cerebrospinal fluid compartment, we studied 12 anesthetized dogs subjected to thoracic aortic occlusion. Pericardia were opened in six (group I), and left intact in six (group II). Systemic hemodynamics and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (mm Hg) were measured before and after thoracic aortic occlusion. In group II, intravenous volume loading (15 ml/kg) was superimposed on aortic occlusion. Compliance of the cerebrospinal fluid space (ml/mm Hg) was measured at each interval by use of sequential injection and withdrawal of small aliquots of fluid. Results are expressed as mean +/- SE; *p less than 0.05. Thoracic aortic occlusion resulted in predictable changes in mean arterial pressure (group I 95.8 +/- 7.1 to 123.3 +/- 7.1*, group II 82.5 +/- 6.9 to 98.3 +/- 9.5*) and central venous pressure (1.9 +/- 0.7 to 3.8 +/- 0.6*, 3.0 +/- 0.8 to 4.0 +/- 0.9*). Although cerebrospinal fluid pressure was increased by thoracic aortic occlusion in both groups (8.0 +/- 1.2 to 12.6 +/- 1.9*; 5.8 +/- 0.9 to 8.5 +/- 1.1*), compliance of the dural space was was not changed (0.61 +/- 0.19 to 0.60 +/- 0.18; 0.54 +/- 0.14 to 0.62 +/- 0.09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities of the conduit, outflow tract, and graft hemodynamics are important elements in the mechanism of vein graft thrombosis, and their role must be defined when planning reoperation. In a consecutive series of 353 in situ saphenous vein bypass graftings performed for occlusive or aneurysmal disease, graft thrombosis occurred in 18 (5%) patients during the perioperative period and unexpectedly in 14 (4%) patients after discharge from the hospital. Assessment of graft hemodynamics (calculation of blood flow velocity) before thrombosis was helpful in predicting success after graft revision. Five grafts with known low flow (systolic flow velocity less than 40 cm/sec) that thrombosed in the perioperative period did not have patency restored by thrombectomy or graft replacement unless the outflow tract was also modified. If poor quality vein or technical error was the mechanism of thrombosis, translocation of the distal anastomosis to a proximal arterial segment (n = 4), and graft replacement with normal autologous vein (n = 5) or prosthetic graft (n = 1) were successful in relieving limb ischemia. After discharge from the hospital, unexpected graft thrombosis was successfully treated by a variety of secondary procedures (thrombolysis/thrombectomy, autologous or prosthetic replacement) if prior surveillance with duplex scanning demonstrated low flow as a result of graft stenosis (n = 7) or normal graft hemodynamics (n = 5). Prosthetic replacement of two failed bypass grafts with low flow caused by diseased outflow did not remain patent. Scrutiny of graft hemodynamics and limb arterial anatomy for alternative outflow sites can identify patients likely to benefit from reoperation after in situ bypass thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The ocular examinations and hospital records of 64 patients with Hollenhorst plaques were retrospectively reviewed to document any associated visual defects and to determine if carotid endarterectomy prevented the occurrence of new plaques or symptoms. One hundred nine Hollenhorst plaques were seen in 75 eyes; 18 had multiple plaques simultaneously. Visual field defects were noted in 14 eyes, four of which corresponded to the location of Hollenhorst plaques. Twenty-eight carotid endarterectomies were performed ipsilateral to a Hollenhorst plaque: 24 patients had no symptoms; four patients developed new ipsilateral asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques at 1 to 50 months after operation. Two late strokes occurred, one of which was ipsilateral to a new Hollenhorst plaque, during a mean follow-up of 50 months (range 8 to 102 months). Thirty-seven eyes with asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques did not undergo ipsilateral operation. Two eyes developed new Hollenhorst plaques during a mean follow-up of 23 months (range 1 to 132 months). Eight eyes in patients with no symptoms had multiple Hollenhorst plaques, one of which was associated with a subsequent stroke. Of the 29 eyes with a single Hollenhorst plaque, one subsequently experienced an ipsilateral stroke, and another had a transient ischemic attack (1 and 3 years later, respectively). Visual field defects infrequently corresponded to locations of Hollenhorst plaques. The cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to asymptomatic plaques had a slightly increased risk of subsequent transient ischemic attack or stroke compared to the contralateral side without Hollenhorst plaques. The number of simultaneous Hollenhorst plaques in the retinal circulation did not predict clinical outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The presence and clinical significance of bacteria in the arterial wall, periarterial adipose tissue, and blood samples acquired during elective vascular operations were assessed in this study. Specimens were obtained from a random series of 84 patients (56 men, 28 women) undergoing 75 primary and 9 secondary arterial reconstructions. Operations performed most frequently included abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy (42), aortofemoral bypass reconstruction (15), and lower extremity bypass surgery for occlusive disease (7). Perioperative antibiotics were administered to all but one patient. A sample of artery, adjacent adipose tissue, and blood were obtained for microbial analysis during the vascular anastomosis or arteriotomy. This yielded a total of 152 artery, 139 adipose tissue, and 129 blood samples for study. Each specimen was divided and placed in blood agar plates, thioglycolate broth, and brain-heart infusion broth. Tissues yielding growth of the same organism(s) in two or more different media were considered positive for the presence of bacteria. Bacteria were present in at least one of the three tissues studied in 32/84 patients (38%). The frequency of positive cultures in primary (29/75, 39%) and secondary procedures (3/9, 33%) were similar. One positive culture site occurred in 26/32 (81%) patients, two positive culture sites existed in 5/32 (16%) patients, and three positive sites were found in 1/22 (3%) patients. Eighteen individual artery (18/152, 12%) and 19 adipose tissue samples (19/139, 14%) harbored bacteria, whereas only two blood cultures were positive (2/129, 2%). Organisms identified included coagulase-negative staphylococci (71%), gamma-streptococci (7%), diphtheroids (7%), Micrococcus (5%), alpha-streptococci (5%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), and Pseudomonas picketti (2%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to quantitate variations in duplex ultrasound arterial flow velocities (cm/sec) in the common carotid artery and the superior mesenteric artery that were produced by changes in the angle of pulsed Doppler insonation. Duplex scanning was used to measure peak systolic flow velocity and mean velocity at angles from 30 degrees to 80 degrees; individual measurements were made at 10-degree increments in both the common carotid artery and the superior mesenteric artery in normal subjects. Peak systolic velocity in the common carotid artery varied from 86 cm/sec at 30 degrees to 168 m/sec at 80 degrees. Over the same transducer angle variation mean velocity ranged from 28 to 53 cm/sec. Similar changes in the superior mesenteric artery flow velocities were observed by varying the angle of insonation, where peak systolic velocity varied from 108 cm/sec (30 degrees) to 280 cm/sec (80 degrees), and mean velocity ranged from 29 cm/sec (30 degrees) to 71 cm/sec (80 degrees). Measurements taken from 70 to 80 degrees produced the most dramatic deviation from those taken at 60 degrees. In the common carotid artery the 70- and 80-degree angles produced 14% and 59% increases, respectively, in peak systolic velocity and 16% and 63% increases, respectively, in mean velocity. In the superior mesenteric artery 70-degree and 80-degree angles produced 16% and 120% increases, respectively, in peak systolic velocity and 17% and 111% increases, respectively, in mean velocity. At 80 degrees the percent increases in measured flow velocities for the superior mesenteric artery were significantly greater than those for the common carotid artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Results of scans performed on 1074 patients over an 18-month period were evaluated to define the limitations of lower extremity venous duplex scanning. Eighty-four patients had confirmatory phlebography performed within 24 hours of their venous duplex scanning. In 71 patients scans were considered diagnostic (sensitivity 91%, specificity 95%). Eighteen studies (13 equivocal, 5 misinterpretations) were scrutinized to determine the limitations of venous duplex scanning compared to phlebography and are the focus of this analysis. Seven patients had phlebograms documenting only infrapopliteal thrombus, seven had normal phlebographic findings, and four had findings consistent with chronic thrombosis. In the seven patients with infrapopliteal thrombus, four had normal imaging outcomes but abnormal Doppler flow patterns, whereas three had both normal imaging results and flow patterns. All four patients with chronic thrombosis had identifiable thrombus and abnormal flow patterns by venous duplex scanning, but in each case thrombus age was indeterminate. Of the seven patients with normal phlebographic results, five had incompressible segments of the superficial femoral vein on imaging, one had abnormal Doppler flow without visualized thrombus and without apparent reason, one had venous duplex scanning visualized thrombus with a normal outcome on phlebography. These data suggest that the diagnostic yield of lower extremity venous duplex scanning may be improved by (1) meticulous infrapopliteal vein examination, (2) better estimation of the age of the thrombotic process, and (3) recognizing segmental incompressibility of the superficial femoral vein within the adductor canal as a normal finding especially in the absence of abnormal Doppler flow or imaged thrombus.",

    "abstract": "The internal mammary artery is used with increasing frequency for myocardial revascularization. However, preoperative coronary angiography does not always provide adequate visualization of subclavian arteries. If a proximal subclavian artery stenosis exists or develops in a patient who has myocardial revascularization with the internal mammary artery, graft malfunction can occur resulting in myocardial ischemia. We have identified four cases of internal mammary artery graft malfunction at our own institution and identified an additional 12 cases from the literature. These 16 cases are analyzed for age, sex, time of onset of symptoms, clinical findings, method of revascularization, and long-term follow-up. Sixty-three percent of the patients were men, and the mean age was 52.9 +/- 9.0 years. Onset of symptoms occurred after a mean interval of 25.1 months from the time of myocardial revascularization. Three patients had asymptomatic reversal of flow in the internal mammary artery as diagnosed by coronary arteriography during routine follow-up examination before 1980. One death after internal mammary artery-coronary bypass grafting was related to immediate malfunction. In the remaining 12 patients with symptomatic malfunction, all but one were treated by placement of a carotid-subclavian bypass graft with no mortality. Relief of myocardial ischemia was complete in 93% of the patients with a mean follow-up of 29.3 months. Carotid-subclavian bypass grafting appears to be the treatment of choice for the usual management of internal mammary artery graft dysfunction. Careful preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up of the subclavian arteries, even by simple comparison of bilateral arm blood pressure should help reduce the incidence of this syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Age as a factor in the selection of patients for carotid endarterectomy was studied with a retrospective evaluation of the perioperative and late results of procedures performed on 115 elderly patients. The results were taken from an experience of 685 operations performed on 607 patients. Perioperative results in 420 patients under 75 years of age (560 operations) were compared with results in 115 patients over 75 years of age (125 operations). Statistical comparison revealed a greater proportion of men in group I (66%, 55%, p = 0.0186) and a greater proportion of patients in group II with contralateral carotid stenosis (24%, 33%, p = 0.0382) and stroke as a preoperative indication for operation (14%, 22%, p = 0.0393). No statistical difference was found between group I and group II as regards other operative indications, contralateral carotid occlusion, bilaterality of operation, emergency operation, operation for recurrent carotid disease, frequency of shunt use, perioperative wound bleeding, and perioperative transient ischemic attack. Ipsilateral perioperative stroke occurred in 12 patients (2%), with all strokes occurring in the younger group of patients (2.4%) (NS). Perioperative death occurred in six (1%) patients, with five deaths (1%) occurring in the younger group (cardiac, 2; stroke, 2; protamine reaction, 1) and one (0.9%) death occurring in the elderly group of patients (ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm) (NS). Life-table analysis of the late results of the 115 elderly patients revealed cumulative survival rates of 85.4% and 63.8% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. The principal causes of late death were cardiac (48%), cancer (15%), and stroke (9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The records of 183 patients who had undergone color-flow imaging of the extracranial carotid arteries and subsequent bilateral cerebral arteriography were reviewed to determine whether contralateral carotid arterial disease adversely affects the accuracy of duplex scanning by increasing the velocity of flow in the ipsilateral artery. In 83 arteries the contralateral internal carotid artery had a diameter reduction greater than or equal to 80%; in the remaining 283, the contralateral artery was less severely diseased. Noninvasive findings correlated less well with arteriography in the group with contralateral disease (k = 0.69 +/- 0.06) than in the group with less severe contralateral stenosis (k = 0.78 +/- 0.03), and the incidence of false-positive errors was significantly (p = 0.02) higher (18% vs 7%). For all categories of ipsilateral stenosis, the mean peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were elevated in the group with severe contralateral disease. This effect was most evident in the 50% to 79% diameter reduction category, especially in reference to the end-diastolic velocity (p = 0.2). However, the data correlating velocity with diameter reduction were widely scattered, indicating that the effect of contralateral disease is inconsistent. We conclude that severe disease of the contralateral carotid artery can lead to overreading ipsilateral disease and that velocity determinations should be interpreted cautiously under such circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Occult infection was investigated as an etiologic factor in the formation of femoral anastomotic pseudoaneurysms associated with prosthetic vascular grafts. Forty-five femoral pseudoaneurysms with no clinical evidence of infection 10 to 173 months after prosthetic graft placement were consecutively studied. The explanted Dacron or explanted polytetrafluoroethylene graft material was cultured in trypticase soy broth and ultrasonically oscillated to remove adherent bacteria. All patients were treated by excision of the pseudoaneurysm and surrounding perigraft capsule and in situ replacement with an interposition prosthetic graft. Thirty-two bacterial isolates were recovered from 27 (60%) of the specimens, with coagulase negative staphylococci (Staphylococcus epidermidis S. warneri, S. hominis, S. capitis) accounting for 24 of the recovered species. No infection of the replacement graft developed in any patient and no recurrent pseudoaneurysms were observed. Bacterial colonization may occur at implantation or during subsequent procedures when the prosthetic graft is exposed. This chronic infection can be diagnosed by means of sensitive culture techniques that dislodge adherent bacteria from the graft surface. On grounds of the observations reported in this study, there appears to be suggestive evidence that an occult infectious process may be one of the factors that play a role in the development of some femoral anastomotic pseudoaneurysms.",

Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses (5 cm x 4 mm internal diameter) were treated either with fibronectin (n = 9), fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin (n = 12), or neither (n = 13) and were interposed into canine aortoiliac systems bilaterally. Autogenous radiolabeled (Indium 111 oxine, 650 microCi) platelets were injected intravenously before reestablishment of circulation. Perfusion was maintained for 30 minutes, and prostheses were removed with segments of native aorta and distal iliac arteries bilaterally. Specimens were examined for thrombus-free surface area, by gamma well counting for adherent radiolabeled platelets, and by light microscopy and transmission and scanning electron microscopic techniques. Results showed that both the fibronectin and fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin pretreated prostheses contained significantly greater numbers of platelets and adherent radioactivity than did control graft segments when normalized to their ipsilateral iliac arteries. Fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin pretreated prostheses contained 27 +/- 16 times more radioactivity per square millimeter than ipsilateral iliac arteries, fibronectin pretreated prostheses had 13 +/- 8 times more radioactivity per square millimeter than ipsilateral iliac arteries, and untreated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene had 4 +/- 3 times more radioactivity per square millimeter than ipsilateral iliac arteries. Fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin was more radioactive than fibronectin alone (p = 0.056). Histologic evaluation and thrombus-free surface area determinations corroborated the gamma well counting data. Platelet aggregation in vitro was not activated by either fibronectin (1 to 100 micrograms/100 microliters) or heparin binding growth factor-type 1 (25 to 2500 ng/100 microliters). These data suggest that fibronectin and heparin binding growth factor-type 1 promote platelet adhesion not aggregation.",

    "abstract": "The importance of porosity in synthetic arterial graft healing has not been adequately defined. To determine the effect of porosity on graft healing, we measured the extent of cellular response at late times in 4 mm internal diameter polytetrafluoroethylene grafts of varying porosity (between 10 and 90 microns internodal distance) inserted into the arterial system of baboons. After 1 and 3 months the grafts were retrieved and examined for endothelial coverage, intimal thickening, and endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell proliferation. The pattern of intimal healing with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells was only related to porosity in the sense that there was an abrupt switch in the pattern of healing as porosity was increased from 30 to 60 microns. In low porosity grafts (10 and 30 microns internodal distances) endothelial coverage of the luminal surface was incomplete and, along with intimal thickening, was limited to graft near the anastomosis. In high porosity grafts (60 and 90 microns internodal distances) luminal endothelial coverage was complete, and intimal thickening was uniformly distributed throughout the graft. The highest porosity graft studied (90 microns) developed areas of focal loss of endothelial cells at late time periods. In this limited series there does appear to be an optimal porosity for polytetrafluoroethylene grafts near 60 microns, since 10 and 30 micron grafts fail to achieve luminal endothelial cell coverage, and 90 micron grafts exhibit instability of the intima with focal endothelial cell loss.",

    "abstract": "Routine arteriography of the axillary, subclavian, and innominate arteries before axillofemoral bypass surgery has not been advocated because of the presumed rarity of stenosis of these inflow vessels. However, we have noted in this patient population with extensive atherosclerosis that inflow disease can cause axillofemoral graft failure despite normal preoperative clinical and noninvasive parameters. We prospectively determined the incidence of unsuspected inflow stenosis with arteriography in 40 consecutive candidates for primary (28) or secondary (12) axillofemoral bypass surgery. A new arteriographic technique with a single translumbar puncture was developed to safely and clearly visualize the potential inflow and outflow tracts. Ten of the 40 patients (25%) exhibited inflow stenosis greater than 50% of luminal diameter (unilateral in eight patients and bilateral in two patients). Seven were on the left side (five subclavian, two axillary) and five were on the right side (three subclavian, one axillary, one innominate). In eight of the 40 patients (20%) the stenotic inflow lesion was ipsilateral to the ischemic leg and therefore proximal to the preferred inflow site of an axillofemoral bypass. Upper extremity arterial pressure measurements suggested potential inflow artery stenosis in only three of the 12 (25%) instances. These findings show that equal arterial pressures in the upper extremities do not ensure adequate inflow for an axillofemoral graft. Routine arteriographic assessment of inflow intacts is recommended before axillofemoral bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence and importance of hypercoagulable states in the general vascular surgical population is unknown. Antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, plasminogen, lupus-like anticoagulant, and heparin-induced platelet activation were determined prospectively in 158 patients with aneurysmal (27), renovascular (1), cerebrovascular (28), aortoiliac (31), or infrainguinal (71) disease. Sixteen abnormal test results were obtained in 15 patients (9.5%) as follows: deficiencies of antithrombin III (2), protein C (4), and protein S (1) and presence of lupus-like anticoagulant activity (5) and heparin-induced platelet activation (4). Reconstructive surgery was performed in 137 of the study patients. Five reconstructions, all infrainguinal bypass grafts, suffered thrombosis within 30 days. Early graft thrombosis occurred in three (27%) of 14 patients with abnormal preoperative test results compared to two (1.6%) of 123 patients with normal testing (p less than 0.01). Of the three patients with abnormal test results and graft thrombosis, lupus-like anticoagulant was detected in two and heparin-induced platelet activation in one. This preliminary study supports routine preoperative screening for lupus-like anticoagulant and heparin-induced platelet activation in patients undergoing infrainguinal reconstruction. Hypercoagulable states appear to be sufficiently common and important in the general vascular surgical population to warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Although an aberrant right subclavian artery arising from the proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta is the most common aortic arch anomaly, few patients have clinical symptoms directly attributable to it. When symptoms do occur they are usually causally related to aneurysmal or occlusive sequelae of atherosclerotic disease of the anomalous vessel. More unusual manifestations peculiar to the anomalous artery include aneurysmal degeneration of the origin of the vessel from the aortic arch, with its inherent risk of rupture, or symptoms of compression of the trachea or more commonly the esophagus by the anomalous vessel as it traverses the superior mediastinum. In patients with symptoms a variety of operative approaches and management strategies have been used. Our recent experience with treatment of two patients with clinical symptoms caused by an aberrant right subclavian artery illustrate the varied surgical options and prompted a review of the surgical management of this unusual anomaly.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic graft rethrombosis after thrombectomy may be potentiated by increased thrombogenicity of the restored flow surface. This experiment compared platelet deposition on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts after balloon catheter thrombectomy with deposition on new, nonthrombosed grafts. Three models of graft thrombosis were studied in eight dogs with 4 mm diameter by 7 cm PTFE graft segments: (1) in vitro model: grafts filled with blood, stored in 37 degrees C saline solution; (2) in vivo model: blood-filled grafts stored in subcutaneous tissue; and (3) in situ model: one end of grafts anastomosed to femoral or carotid artery as a blind tube. Duration of thrombosis (1, 2, and 3 weeks) was studied by initiating one graft of each type per week in each dog. After 3 weeks, nine thrombosed grafts per dog were harvested and graft thrombectomy was performed with a 3F balloon catheter. An ex vivo flow-controlled perfusion circuit was then created in each dog and platelet deposition was measured during the initial 20 minutes of graft perfusion after 111In platelet labeling. Thrombectomized grafts were compared with new, control grafts not previously exposed to blood, as well as with grafts exposed for 1 hour to blood or plasma. Compared with control grafts, platelet deposition was significantly increased on in vivo (3.7 times control; p less than 0.01), in situ (2.6 times control; p less than 0.05), and in vitro thrombosed grafts (2.0 times control; p less than 0.05). Age of thrombus was not a significant source of variation. Blood or plasma exposure alone did not significantly increase platelet deposition. These data suggest that antiplatelet therapy may be important at the time of PTFE graft thrombectomy.",

Postoperative morbidity was high in the patients with an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm, and included a 21% incidence of myocardial infarction, a 10% incidence of stroke, a 37% risk of ventilatory failure, and a 31% incidence of acute renal failure, which was not statistically different from the results in patients having ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection had only an 8% risk of myocardial infarction, and only a 2% risk of stroke, ventilatory failure, or renal failure. The mortality rate for expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm resection was 26% compared to 35% for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (p = 0.31). Both emergency operations had a mortality rate more than five times greater than the 5.1% after elective procedures (p = 0.008). Our findings emphasize the need for early and aggressive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the elective setting, even in the patient at high risk, and suggest that the preoperative assessment and modification of risk factors is important to prevent the cardiac, cerebrovascular, pulmonary, and renal complications seen accompanying an emergency operation of this magnitude.",

    "abstract": "To define better the short-term risk and long-term benefit of carotid endarterectomy opposite an occluded carotid artery, we reviewed our experience since 1961. Angiographic data are available for 598 of 670 (89.3%) patients in our carotid registry. In 63 (10.5%) patients the internal or common carotid artery on the side opposite the endarterectomy was occluded. All operations were carried out under general anesthesia with selective shunting based on electroencephalographic criteria. Shunting was required in 29 of 63 (46.0%) patients with contralateral occlusion and 72 of 535 (13.5%) control subjects (p less than 0.0001). Perioperative strokes occurred in 3 of 63 (4.8%) patients with contralateral occlusion and 14 of 535 control subjects (2.6%) (p = 0.23). Perioperative death occurred in 0 of 63 patients with contralateral occlusion and 6 of 535 (1.1%) control subjects (p = 0.40). Life-table cumulative stroke-free rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 95.2%, 91.0%, and 76.2% in the group with contralateral occlusion and 96.0%, 89.4%, and 84.1% in control subjects (p = 0.25). Life-table cumulative survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 93.1%, 80.8%, and 75.4% in the group with contralateral occlusion and 94.8%, 77.0%, and 57.9% in control subjects (p = 0.58). Carotid endarterectomy contralateral to an occluded carotid artery may be carried out with acceptable risk and late stroke-free and survival rates comparable to those seen in other patients who have undergone carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "A 28-year-old major league baseball pitcher sustained an axillary artery thrombosis which was successfully treated with intraarterial urokinase. Subsequent angiography and duplex scanning with the arm elevated in the pitching position demonstrated inducible compression of the axillary artery by the humeral head as well as compression at the thoracic outlet. To determine the incidence of axillary and subclavian artery compression and to investigate the mechanism of injury, brachial artery blood pressures and duplex scans of the subclavian and axillary arteries were performed in both the neutral position and the throwing position in the 92 extremities of 19 major league baseball pitchers, 16 non-pitching major league players, and 11 nonathlete controls. A drop in blood pressure of greater than 20 mm Hg was noted in the position in 56% of extremities tested, with a loss of a detectable blood pressure in 13%. Compression of the axillary artery by the humeral head was documented in 83% of extremities, but in only 7.6% was a greater than 50% stenosis inducible. No statistical difference was found in the incidence of arterial compression between the three groups tested or between their dominant and nondominant extremities. Dissection of the axillary artery in two cadavers documented that abduction and external rotation of the arm causes compression of the axillary artery by the humeral head, which acts as a fulcrum. We conclude that the repetitive mechanical trauma of the throwing motion can cause intermittent compression and contusion of the axillary artery by the humeral head and predisposes the athlete who throws to thrombosis of the axillary artery.",

    "abstract": "Limbs of diabetic patients with distal tibial disease are frequently considered unreconstructible; however, when studied with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography, the dorsal pedal artery is frequently found to be patent. We have reviewed our recent experience with 96 patients, 94% of whom had diabetes and had 97 bypasses placed to the dorsal pedal artery. All procedures were for limb salvage. Superimposed infection was present in 42.3%. In 92 instances where intraarterial digital subtraction angiography successfully visualized the dorsal pedal artery, 91 bypasses were placed. In 12 other cases where the dorsal pedal artery was not visualized by intraarterial digital subtraction angiography but audible with the continuous-wave Doppler, bypasses were completed successfully in six. All procedures were performed with vein. Inflow was taken from the femoral artery in 48, popliteal artery in 45, tibial artery in 2, and from a femoral tibial graft in 2. Perioperative mortality was 1.92%. Actuarial graft patency, limb salvage, and patient survival were 82%, 87%, and 80%, respectively at 18 months. We conclude that bypass grafting to the dorsal pedal artery can be reliably performed with acceptable short-term results. An attempt should always be made to visualize the foot vessels angiographically, especially in diabetic patients, so that this valuable option in arterial reconstruction will not be overlooked.",

    "abstract": "Forty-two consecutive patients diagnosed with superficial phlebitis were seen during a 5-year period. Thirty-five of the 42 patients were outpatients. The diagnosis of superficial phlebitis was made by the presence of palpable subcutaneous cords in the course of the greater saphenous vein or its tributaries in association with tenderness, erythema, and edema. The presence of concurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was assessed by impedance plethysmography in 37 patients, compression venous ultrasonography in 3 patients, and venography in 8 patients. Five of the 42 patients (12%) had DVT. Four of these five patients had a positive impedance plethysmographic or ultrasonographic test result followed by a confirmatory venogram. The fifth patient had a positive ultrasonographic test result, but no venogram was performed. Two of the five patients had clots that involved the popliteal or femoral veins. Four of 23 patients (17%) with superficial phlebitis at or above the knee had DVT. Only 1 of the 19 patients (5%) with superficial phlebitis below the knee had DVT. Three of the five patients with both superficial phlebitis and DVT had undergone surgery recently. All but 3 of the 42 patients (93%) had varicose veins. No patients had clinically apparent pulmonary emboli. DVT occurred in 17% of the patients with above-knee extension of the superficial phlebitis. In the clinical management of superficial lower-limb thrombophlebitis, noninvasive tests should be performed to guide therapy. When superficial phlebitis develops after recent surgery or the superficial phlebitis extends above the knee, diagnostic surveillance should be especially strict. When the noninvasive test results are equivocal, phlebography is indicated to rule out DVT.",

    "abstract": "Increasing knowledge that has accumulated during the past decade reveals that the endothelial cell plays a far larger role than that traditionally assigned to it, namely maintenance of the fluid state of the blood. Unraveling the complex interreactions of the endothelial cell with the other cellular and molecular components of the arterial wall, as well as with the blood and its cellular and particulate components, is leading to better understanding of anastomotic hyperplasia and recurrent stenosis after endarterectomy and balloon angioplasty. More recently with the newly acquired techniques of inserting genetic material into the vascular endothelial cell many new therapeutic possibilities may be developed. Important to the technique of seeding vascular grafts, and the possible use of the genetically modified endothelial cell for gene therapy systems, are the needs to identify the origin of the cell originally seeded and ways to increase their number. Retroviral vectors and genetically conferred antibiotic resistance provide these means.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the usefulness of transcranial Doppler sonography in determining severity of extracranial carotid disease, we compared transcranial Doppler, ocular pneumoplethysmography, Doppler spectral analysis, and duplex scanning data to information derived from cerebral angiography. Fifty-one consecutive patients with unilateral extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion were selected. Transcranial Doppler indexes included the peak systolic flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the stenosed internal carotid artery (iMCAFV), the difference between the peak systolic flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral and contralateral to the stenosed internal carotid artery (dMCAFV), and the peak systolic flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery contralateral to the stenosed internal carotid artery (cACAFV). The minimal residual lumen determined angiographically was used as the index of internal carotid artery stenosis. Linear regression analysis with minimal residual lumen as the dependent variable and transcranial Doppler and noninvasive tests as independent variables showed the following correlation coefficients: (1) dMCAFV and cACAFV, R2 = 0.3170; (2) ocular pneumoplethysmography, R2 = 0.4798; (3) dMCAFV, cACAFV, delta ocular pneumoplethysmography, duplex scanning, and spectral analysis R2 = 0.6382; (4) ocular pneumoplethysmography, duplex scanning, and spectral analysis, R2 = 0.6491; (5) iMCAFV, no association. These results were supported by sensitivity and specificity as well as bivariate analysis. We conclude that transcranial Doppler did not significantly add to the information obtained by our noninvasive battery of tests in the evaluation of unilateral extracranial carotid disease.",

    "abstract": "Early infragenicular vein graft thrombosis is associated with poor secondary patency, particularly when no correctable defect is identified. We have attempted to improve patency of thrombosed vein grafts by direct infusion of vasodilator and anticoagulant drugs after surgical thrombectomy. Among 212 infragenicular vein grafts, 16 (7.5%) required thrombectomy within 30 days of surgery (14 in situ saphenous vein, 1 composite vein, and 1 cephalic vein graft). Causes for failure were corrected in four (graft twist, intimal tear, suture failure, and external compression), resulting in prolonged patency. No cause for failure was apparent in the 12 remaining grafts after balloon catheter thrombectomy and arteriography. Two of these grafts occluded within 10 days despite multiple attempts at vein patch angioplasty, distal graft extension, and repeat thrombectomy with systemic anticoagulation. In the remaining 10 grafts, a small polyethylene catheter was placed in a proximal vein branch for direct intragraft drug infusion. Heparin (10 units/min) and nitroglycerin (50 micrograms/min) were the agents infused most frequently, for a mean duration of 52 hours after thrombectomy. Of these 10 infused grafts, 8 remained patent during a mean 17-month follow-up (range, 6 to 38 months). This was accomplished despite previous and repeated failures of thrombectomy and systemic anticoagulation in seven of these eight grafts. Two infused grafts rethrombosed within 30 days of infusion, resulting in amputation. No catheter-related complications occurred. Increased thrombogenicity, intimal injury, and spasm after balloon catheter thrombectomy may contribute to vein graft rethrombosis in the absence of technical defects. Direct intragraft infusion of nitroglycerin and heparin contributed to prolonged salvage of 80% of thrombosed vein grafts in this preliminary experience.",

    "abstract": "Despite the risks associated with renovascular hypertension and the durable benefits of revascularization, the detection of patients with renovascular hypertension and the selection of those who will benefit from interventional therapy remains a challenge. We have previously documented the reliability of captopril renal scintigraphy in predicting angiographically significant renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension. In the present study we report our recent experience with this noninvasive technique in predicting outcome after revascularization. Captopril renal scintigraphy involves the administration of 50 mg of captopril 3 hours after a baseline technitium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scan and 1 hour before a repeat captopril renal scintigraphy scan. Nineteen of the last 70 patients with clinically suspected renovascular hypertension undergoing captopril renal scintigraphy had abnormal renal scan outcomes, and 17 had a decrease in flow or function after captopril (positive captopril renal scintigraphy). Eight of these 17 with abnormal findings on captopril renal scintigraphy underwent revascularization, and the hypertension was cured or improved in six of the eight: two of three after surgical bypass grafting and four of five after angioplasty. In the seven surviving patients with abnormal renal scan results but no change with captopril (negative captopril renal scintigraphy), improvement in hypertension after treatment occurred in only one: one of two after nephrectomy, zero of three after bypass surgery, and zero of two after angioplasty (p less than 0.05). We conclude that captopril renal scintigraphy is an accurate predictor of hypertension response to revascularization. Further evaluation of this new noninvasive technique for assessing patients with suspected renovascular hypertension appears warranted.",

Previous vascular fellowship programs during the era of evolution of our subspecialty were characterized by clinical preceptorships or research programs with little thought about the impact on training of general surgery residents. The current era of educational safeguards permits approved vascular training programs provided that adequate educational experience, operative caseload, and appropriate supervision are ensured for both the vascular and general surgical trainee. The future portends significant changes in general surgical and subspecialty training to enhance the career goals of all surgical residents. Such evolutionary changes are necessary to not only capitalize on the benefits of subspecialty care but also enhance the professional standing and expertise of the general surgeon. These modifications in training programs will require the coordinated efforts of major societal, governmental, accrediting, and certifying organizations.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged ischemia to skeletal muscle as occurs after an acute arterial occlusion results in alterations in adenine nucleotide metabolism. Adenosine triphosphate continues to be used for cellular functions, and an ischemia-induced degradation of phosphorylated adenine nucleotides is initiated. In this experiment we demonstrated the time-dependent aspect of adenine nucleotide depletion during ischemia and the production of large quantities of soluble precursors. In addition, we studied the rate of conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase, a potential source of oxygen-free radicals, after controlled periods of total normothermic ischemia (4 hours and 5 hours) and during the reperfusion phase. During ischemia complete depletion of creatine phosphate occurred in both groups, and adenosine triphosphate fell from 22.1 +/- 1.3 to 10.3 +/- 1.4 mumol/gm dry weight after 4 hours and from 21.6 +/- 0.7 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mumol/gm dry weight after 5 hours (p less than 0.05). During reperfusion, creatine phosphokinase resynthesis occurred in both groups, but adenosine triphosphate levels were not significantly increased (p greater than 0.05). A washout of lipid soluble products of adenine nucleotide metabolism occurred equally in both groups. The relationship between phosphorylated adenine nucleotides as measured by the energy charge potential fell significantly in both groups (p less than 0.05), but after the shorter period of ischemia (4 hours it returned to normal during early reperfusion but did not after 5 hours of ischemia. There was 21% +/- 4% necrosis after 4 hours and 51% +/- 8% after 5 hours of ischemic stress when assessed at 48 hours. In conclusion, the degree of adenine nucleotide degeneration as determined primarily by the length of the ischemic period, may be the most important determinant of the ultimate extent of skeletal muscle ischemic necrosis that results from an acute interruption of circulation.",

The classic diagnostic signs of an aortocaval fistula (pulsatile abdominal mass with bruit and high output heart failure) were present in approximately half of the patients, whereas hematuria was a constant finding in all patients. Six patients had macrohematuria, and five had microhematuria. Seven patients (64% survived, and four had postoperative complications: 1 ileus, 2 postoperative pneumonias, 2 deep venous thrombosis, 1 postoperative hemorrhage. The mean operative blood loss was 7 L. After operation the average follow-up time was 4 years. In four patients who died the perioperative (within 30 days) causes of death were renal failure, a bleeding duodenal carcinoma, myocardial infarction, and operative bleeding. It is concluded that hematuria is a more frequent finding than earlier assumed among patients whose abdominal aortic aneurysm has ruptured into the vena cava. The presence of hematuria in a patient suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm is an indication for aortography to rule out an aortocaval fistula.",

    "abstract": "A canine model for inferior vena cava resection was devised to study the biomechanical and clinical applications of the cartridge stapler, which applies a triple staggered staple line. Eighteen mongrel dogs were subjected to subhepatic, suprarenal inferior vena cava occlusion with excision of the excluded segment. At 1 hour, six dogs were killed and inferior vena cava sizes and pressures were measured. All staple lines were intact. The inferior vena cava bursting pressure was 150 to 300 mm Hg. Ten dogs survived to 6 weeks and underwent repeat laparotomy with excision and measurement of the remaining inferior vena cava. Mean diameter was 1.9 cm. No evidence of staple line leakage was found despite chronic pressures to 39 cm H2O: median static bursting pressures were 250 mm Hg. Vein wall thickness of greater than 0.24 mm were all satisfactorily stapled. Histologic examination revealed normal reendothelialization, with improved healing at higher chronic pressures. No evidence of inflammation at the staple line or foreign body reaction was found. We conclude that a triple staple line provides secure, rapid venous occlusion that can withstand supraphysiologic stresses immediately and at 6 weeks.",

    "abstract": "The use of computed tomographic (CT) scanning in the diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is controversial because the delay created by the procedure, it has been argued, may increase overall mortality. However, if emergency surgery can be avoided in the medically compromised patient, surgical results may improve. To assess the value of CT scanning, we studied the 1983 to 1988 records of 65 hemodynamically stable patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, who underwent diagnostic CT scanning for acute abdominal or back pain. Twenty-one patients had a history of severe cardiac, renal, or pulmonary disease. The average duration of the examination was 63 minutes; no episodes of hypotension occurred. Subsequently, 17 of 18 patients with ruptured aneurysms had emergency surgery, with 31% morbidity and 29% mortality. Of 44 patients found to have nonruptured aneurysms, 13 had other causes for their pain, nine were not considered surgical candidates, and 24 had elective aneurysmectomies, with 8% morbidity and 0% mortality. In three patients CT scanning excluded the diagnosis of aneurysm. Additional information provided by CT scanning enhanced the safety of the perioperative management of four patients with rupture and 14 without. In conclusion, the delay imposed by obtaining a preoperative CT scan in patients with possible ruptured aneurysm did not adversely affect patient outcome, and the information obtained from it aided significantly in both preoperative and intraoperative management.",

    "abstract": "A consecutive series of 532 patients (1.5%) required local thrombectomy and arterial repair after 34,291 transbrachial cardiac catheterizations performed at the Cleveland Clinic from 1980 to 1988. A total of 514 patients (97%) were discharged from the hospital with normal radial pulses and/or normal ulnar pulses after a single surgical procedure. Fourteen others (3%) each required one additional procedure to regain a distal pulse, and four patients either underwent two reoperations, received thrombolytic therapy, and/or remained pulseless. Surgical delay of more than 1 day after catheterization was associated with a higher incidence of recurrent thrombosis (12% vs 2%, p = 0.025). In comparison to our previous experience with iatrogenic brachial injuries, the liberal use of segmental arterial resection and overnight heparin anticoagulation seem especially to reduce the risk for early failure in all patients, but improvement was particularly marked in women (25% vs 6%, p = 0.0004).",

    "abstract": "Vascular proliferative lesions may occur after arterial injury and consist of inflammatory cells and proliferating smooth muscle cells. We studied the effect of cyclosporine on modulating the response to experimental arterial injury in rats. Arterial injury was created in 90 rats by rotating a 1 mm coronary dilator in the right common iliac artery. After treatment with parenteral cyclosporine 2 mg/kg/day or 5 mg/kg/day, or with saline solution, right and left iliac arteries were perfusion fixed and cross sectioned. The thickness of the tunica media was measured, and the groups were compared with a Student's t test. In the control groups the injured iliac artery had significant medial thickening when compared to the noninjured (p less than 0.05) from 1 to 42 days after injury. Injured arteries treated with cyclosporine 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days showed significantly less medial thickening when compared to controls (p less than 0.01). Cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/day for 14, 28, and 42 days showed a significant inhibition of medial thickening (p less than 0.05) for each time period. These results show that cyclosporine affects the response to experimental arterial injury by inhibiting the development of medial thickening. The most consistent effects were seen with a cyclosporine dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 2 to 6 weeks. These data also provide further evidence that immunologic mechanisms may modulate vascular proliferative lesions.",

    "abstract": "The presentation summarized the current status of funding available for vascular surgeons. In spite of the shrinking support for research by the federal government, there are opportunities for young investigators to pursue an academic career. Success of a grant application depends on preparation, design, and hypothesis. Potential applicants are encouraged to pay special attention to the many publications on how to prepare a research grant. Although there is an increase in participation by vascular surgeons in NIH-supported research, the funding support and focus on vascular surgery remains unsatisfactory. Despite the high ranking of death from aortic aneurysm, there is virtually no funded project on aortic aneurysm in either basic or clinical study. New technology such as laser has received some support, but clinical trial comparing this modality with standard treatment is lacking and not forthcoming. The participation by vascular surgeons in the American Heart Association-funded research activities remains unknown, even though the American Heart Association claims to have spent millions on research in heart and vascular diseases. To promote the study of and research in vascular disease, the members of this distinguished Society need to guide young vascular surgeons to submit grant proposals to various organizations.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate day-to-day variability of Doppler ophthalmic pressure index by means of the ophthalmomanometry-Doppler technique, bilateral ophthalmic artery pressure and indirect systemic blood pressure determinations were repeated within 1 month in 40 patients with clinically stable occlusive carotid disease. No difference in Doppler ophthalmic pressure and calculated pressure index between both days could be demonstrated. The standard deviation of differences in ophthalmic pressure index between first and second day measurements was 0.04. Correlation between bilateral ophthalmic pressure index measurements on both days was high (r = 0.93, n = 80). It is concluded that individual Doppler ophthalmic pressure index must change at least 0.08 before it can be considered significant. In 37 patients with occlusive carotid artery disease (greater than 60% diameter reduction) undergoing 38 endarterectomies, Doppler ophthalmic pressure index was evaluated before and after surgery. Mean +/- SD ipsilateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index increased from 0.59 +/- 0.07 to 0.71 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.001) after endarterectomy. In 12 patients with significant bilateral occlusive carotid disease, mean +/- SD contralateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index increased from 0.54 +/- 0.05 to 0.61 +/- 0.06 (p less than 0.02), whereas contralateral pressure index in patients with unilateral disease showed no change (0.71 vs 0.71) after ipsilateral endarterectomy. These results indicate that carotid endarterectomy not only normalizes ipsilateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index but also improves contralateral Doppler ophthalmic pressure index provided significant bilateral occlusive carotid disease is present.",

In 10 patients (50%) the valves of the deep veins were incompetent as verified by Doppler ultrasonography, and deep vein thrombosis had previously been diagnosed in seven patients. After subfascial ligature, strain gauge plethysmography showed no changes in arterial flow, venous capacity, or in venous emptying rate. However, both venous reflux flow and reflux volume were significantly lowered (p less than 0.01) after surgery as compared to values before operation. The clinical objective results were good in all cases. In two of four patients with fair subjective results the arterial flow was pathologically high, which probably implies the presence of microscopic arteriovenous fistulas. It is concluded that strain gauge plethysmography can quantitate the change in deep venous reflux after ligation of perforating veins.",

    "abstract": "Seven patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms infected with salmonella organisms were surgically treated between 1985 and 1988. Salmonella culture was obtained from the wall of the aneurysm in every patient, and in five patients it was identified as Salmonella typhimurium. S. choleraesuis and salmonella group D (isolated from this patient but not speciated) were found in the other two remaining patients. Three patients underwent aneurysmal resection with axillofemoral bypass grafting, and three patients were treated by aneurysmal resection with in situ graft; two of this group had the wall and infective periaortic tissue excised. One patient died during the operation as a result of rupture of the aneurysm. Therapeutic doses of antibiotic drugs were given to all of the patients. Although two of the patients in the first group (with the axillofemoral bypass graft) died and the remaining patient had very complicated postoperative course, all the patients in the second group (with in situ graft) survived. We think that in situ graft placement after an extensive debridement of the aneurysmal wall and infected periaortic tissue together with more effective and adequate antibiotic therapy for at least 6 weeks after the operation is a satisfactory method of surgical treatment of this condition. However, graft infection is still a possibility, therefore regular follow-up is needed.",

    "abstract": "Human saphenous veins were obtained at surgery and assayed immediately (n = 10). The veins were cut into rings, suspended in organ chambers, and connected to force transducers for the recording of isometric tension. One ring served as control whereas others were treated with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (3 X 10(-7) mol/L), or the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (10(-7) mol/L). In quiescent rings cooling from 37 degrees C to 24 degrees C had no significant effect. Norepinephrine (10(-8)-10(-5) mol/L) caused concentration-dependent contractions with an EC20 (-log concentration of norepinephrine required to induce contractions 20% of maximal) = 6.97 +/- 0.10. The contractions were inhibited by prazosin (EC20 = 5.89 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.001) and rauwolscine (ED20 = 5.78 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001). In control rings cooling potentiated contractions evoked at concentrations of norepinephrine below 10(-6) mol/L and inhibited those at higher concentrations. In rings treated with alpha-antagonists cooling depressed the maximal contractile responses. Contractions to the alpha 1-agonist, phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L), were inhibited by cooling, whereas those to the alpha 2-specific agonist B-HT 920 (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L) showed a pattern similar to that seen with norepinephrine. The data indicate that the human saphenous vein possesses both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors postjunctionally, and that both contribute to contractile responses. Cold augments saphenous vein reactivity to norepinephrine by an apparent increase in the responsiveness of alpha 2-adrenoceptors to agonists. The relationship between temperature and adrenoceptor responsiveness may be of pivotal importance in defining the mechanism of cold-induced vasospasm.",

    "abstract": "A knitted Dacron velour externally supported prosthesis was broken in two pieces at the supported portion 3 years after femoroposterior tibial bypass grafting. This type of graft problem has never been reported. Details of the clinical course, angiogram, CT scan, and scanning electron micrograph of a portion of the graft are shown. The externally supported Dacron prosthesis broke into two pieces along the broken coil of the middle portion. A possible cause of this failure may have been due to damage of the Dacron fibers in the process of heat fusing the coil. This presentation emphasizes the possibility of this rare externally supported graft complication, and the necessity for careful follow-up not only of the graft patency but also for the mechanical defects of the implanted externally supported Dacron graft itself.",

    "abstract": "Complete intraoperative postreconstruction angiograms were obtained during 93 reoperations after failed femoropopliteal and femorodistal bypass grafts to evaluate the predictive value of a new method of angiographic runoff assessment. Good runoff was defined as patency of two or three lower leg arteries to the foot, or one patent vessel continuous with an intact anterior or posterior foot arch in femoropopliteal and proximal femorodistal bypasses, and integrity of both arches in low femorodistal bypasses. All other outflow patterns were considered poor. The cumulative 1-year patency rate was 61% with a 79% limb salvage rate after reoperations performed in limbs with good runoff. In reoperations with poor runoff, the patency rate was only 5% with a 22% limb salvage rate. In reoperations with good runoff, and 85% patency rate of vein grafts compared to 43% of prosthetic grafts clearly demonstrated the importance of graft material on early outcome. The improved prediction of early outcome with this new method of angiographic runoff evaluation might allow more rational management of patients with failed infrainguinal grafts.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell seeding onto untreated polytetrafluoroethylene vascular prostheses is inefficient. In an effort to improve cell attachment, numerous investigators have used fibronectin as a coating material to pretreat the luminal surfaces of these prostheses. The concentrations of fibronectin used have varied enormously, and no one has yet determined the most efficient concentration in terms of cell attachment and cost. Using endothelial cells labeled with indium 111 oxine we have studied the effect of varying fibronectin concentration on the attachment of these cells onto polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts. Seeding efficiency was significantly better in all groups of coated grafts, at all times (10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes), compared to uncoated controls (p less than 0.01). Overall, fibronectin at a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml was found to be the most efficient in terms of cell attachment and cost since any further increase in concentration was not accompanied by increased cell attachment. We now routinely use fibronectin at a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml to coat our grafts before endothelial cell seeding.",

    "abstract": "A rapid and reliable harvest and culture technique was developed to provide a sufficient number of autologous endothelial cells for the confluent in vitro lining of cardiovascular prostheses. Enzymatic endothelial cell detachment was achieved by the in situ application of collagenase to short vessel segments. This harvest technique resulted in a complete lack of contaminating smooth muscle cells in all of 124 cultures from nonhuman primates and 13 cultures from human adults. The use of a microgrid technique enabled the daily in situ quantification of available endothelial cells. To assess ideal plating densities after passage the population doubling time was continuously related to the cell density. Surprisingly, a low plating density of 1.5 X 10(3) endothelial cells/cm2 achieved 43% shorter cell cycles than the usual plating density of 1.0 X 10(4) endothelial cells/cm2. Moreover, low density plating enabled mass cultures after one single cell passage, thereby reducing the cell damaging effect of trypsin. When the growth characteristics of endothelial cells from five anatomically different vessel sites were compared, the external jugular vein--which would be easily accessible and dispensable in each patient--proved to be an excellent source for endothelial cell cultures. By applying in situ administration of collagenase, low density plating and microgrid follow-up to adult human saphenous vein endothelial cells, 14,000,000 first passage endothelial cells--sufficient for the in vitro lining of long vascular prostheses--were obtained 26.2 days after harvest. (95% confidence interval:22.3 to 32.2 days).",

    "abstract": "Accurate hemodynamic evaluation of the aortoiliac system for the purpose of determining the need for an inflow procedure currently requires invasive pressure measurements. This study was undertaken to evaluate a noninvasive technique with the aortofemoral transfer function. Twenty-eight human aortoiliac segments were studied with intraarterial pressure measurements, with and without papaverine injection, and by calculation of the Doppler-derived mean power frequency index obtained by digital signal processing of aortic and femoral spectra. The procedure is menu driven and can be performed by any duplex ultrasound technologist. This technique involves recording 20 aortic and 20 femoral Doppler signals, requiring less than 1 minute of data acquisition time. Intraarterial pressure measurements were used to classify arteries into the three following groups: (1) normal arteries, (2) arteries with subcritical stenoses, and (3) arteries with critical stenoses. The mean power frequency index of group 1 arteries (n = 7) was 0.63 +/- 0.04, of group 2 arteries (n = 6) was 0.46 +/- 0.02, and of group 3 arteries (n = 15) was 0.21 +/- 0.05. These mean power frequency index values were significantly different by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p less than 0.0001). Each group could be differentiated from the other groups with a sensitivity of 0.83 to 1.00, a specificity of 1.00, and an accuracy of 0.92 to 1.00 compared to intraarterial pressure measurements, including papaverine testing. Measurement of the mean power frequency index is a rapid, noninvasive technique that diagnoses and quantifies aortoiliac stenoses with an accuracy similar to intraarterial pressure measurements.",

    "abstract": "We have developed an implantable 20 MHz Doppler flow sensor, to monitor blood flow in patients after operation. During surgery the sensor is wrapped around a blood vessel and secured in place with a releasable tie. No tissue puncturing techniques are required. The lead wires, together with a release cable, are exteriorized through the chest wall. Several days after operation, the tie is externally released, and the sensor is pulled out. Twenty-seven sensors were implanted in 24 dogs for up to 16 days. All were extracted successfully with minimal visible behavioral reaction in the awake dogs and caused no thrombosis or vascular damage. The Doppler velocity signals had excellent linear correlations (r = 0.99) with data from electromagnetic flow sensors and timed blood collections. In addition, the sensors were applied to coronary artery bypass grafts in 31 patients for up to 2 days after operation. High-quality signals were obtained, and intraoperatively recorded signals agreed well with simultaneous electromagnetic flow tracings. All sensors were extracted with minimal discomfort to the awake patients and with no complications. Thus, the implantable flow sensor is a safe, reliable, accurate, and simple method for intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of blood flow in vessels 2.5 to 5 mm in diameter.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell seeding methods might reduce the high failure rates of venous vascular prostheses, but low flow rates in venous vascular prostheses impose a need to protect early patency and to attain early endothelial cell coverage without waiting several weeks for relatively small endothelial cell innocula from autologous veins to form confluent linings. To obtain large number of autologous endothelial cells for high-density seeding, canine omental microvascular endothelial cells were harvested by collagenase digestion and density gradient centrifugation, with yields of 1.34 +/- 0.24 (SD) X 10(6) cells/gm of omentum (N = 8 harvests). Primary culture of a subfraction from each harvest showed the cell population to be dominated by factor VIII-related antigen-positive endothelial cells with only a few nonstaining cells (estimated to be 10% or less of total cell number) visible. Freshly harvested omental cells were seeded onto double velour knitted Dacron prostheses at densities of 5 X 10(5) cells/cm2 of graft luminal surface in an autologous plasma suspension by use of prior preclotting with cell-free autologous plasma, followed by endothelial cell seeding in autologous plasma, with plasma recalcification during endothelial cell instillation. Six seeded and two control (sham-seeded) vascular prostheses 5 cm long with 10 mm inner diameter were used as inferior vena cava interposition grafts. A distal arteriovenous fistula and aspirin (300 mg) and dipyridamole (50 mg orally every day) starting 3 days before surgery were used to protect early patency of all grafts. Seeded venous vascular prostheses were explanted for study at intervals of 1,5, and 10 days after surgery (N = 2 prostheses at each time); the two control venous vascular prostheses were explanted at 10 days. All venous vascular prostheses were patent at time of removal. In seeded venous vascular prostheses, light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy showed emergence of numerous flattened endothelial cell-like cells on the luminal surface 24 hours after surgery, followed by formation of a confluent cellular lining without adherent platelets by 5 to 10 days after surgery. Control venous vascular prostheses, in contrast, remained covered by an irregularly thickened fibrin and red cell thrombus, which sometimes encroached on the lumen. Our results suggest that (1) omental tissue can furnish endothelial cells for high-density immediate seeding of venous vascular prostheses, and (2) that the method we used to combine features of both so-called high density \"seeding\" and \"sodding\" techniques offers both more rapid prosthesis coverage than the former and shorter intraoperative times for cell attachment to prostheses than the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study compared the effects of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, thromboxane receptor antagonist, and cyclooxygenase inhibitor in a canine arterial graft patency model. Fifty-six dogs were divided into a control (no treatment) and five treatment groups: thromboxane synthase inhibitor (U63557A; 15 mg/kg/tid); thromboxane receptor antagonist (SQ29548; 0.02 mg/kg/hr); high-dose aspirin (325 mg/day; low-dose aspirin (1 mg/kd/day; and aspirin plus dipyridamole (325 mg/day aspirin; 3 mg/kg/day dipyridamole). Drugs were orally administered except for thromboxane receptor antagonist, which was delivered intravenously by minosmotic pumps. After 24 hours of drug treatment, bilateral femoral artery prosthetic grafts (4 mm diameter x 7 cm; 1 polytetrafluoroethylene and 1 Dacron) were implanted. Patency was determined after 1 week. Dogs were classified before operation according to their epinephrine-enhanced arachidonate-stimulated platelet aggregation response. Polytetrafluoroethylene and Dacron graft patency rates were equivalent in all groups. Overall graft patency was significantly improved from 42% (control) to 94% by both high-dose aspirin and thromboxane receptor antagonist (p less than 0.001). Aspirin-dipyridamole also improved patency (83%; p less than 0.01 versus control), whereas thromboxane synthase inhibitor and low-dose aspirin were not effective. Baseline platelet aggregation was not predictive of patency. The drugs that promoted graft patency in this model either suppressed both thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 formation (high-dose aspirin) or blocked their combined platelet receptor (thromboxane receptor antagonist). Thromboxane synthase inhibitor may be ineffective because prostaglandin H2 production is allowed. These data suggest that activation of the platelet thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 receptor is an essential event in early arterial graft thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The endothelium releases factor(s) that are potent vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. Experiments were performed to determine whether the endothelium-dependent responses to aggregating platelets are altered in vein grafts. Segments of jugular veins were grafted in the reverse position into the carotid arteries in 16 rabbits. After 4 weeks the patent grafts (14 of 16) were removed, and the endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In control veins aggregating platelets, adenosine diphosphate, and serotonin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. The platelet-induced relaxations were attenuated by apyrase (adenosine diphosphatase and adenosine triphosphatase) but not by methiothepin (serotonergic blocker). In vein grafts, endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to aggregating platelets were absent, and only contractions that could be attenuated by methiothepin were observed. In vein grafts, endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to adenosine diphosphate were reduced, and only endothelium-independent contractions were observed in response to serotonin. These contractions were attenuated by methiothepin. These results suggest that (1) the endothelium exerts an inhibitory effects mediated mainly by adenosine diphosphate in response to aggregating platelets in rabbit jugular veins and (2) endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to aggregating platelets are impaired in vein grafts because of reduced endothelium-independent contractions in response to serotonin. This impairment of endothelium-dependent responses in vein grafts may contribute to failure of the grafts.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence and severity of ischemic cerebral symptoms after carotid occlusion depends on the interdependency of cerebral collateral blood supply. Only those with the \"fittest\" collateral capacity survive this process of natural selection. Using the transcranial Doppler method in 55 patients with unilateral carotid occlusion, we tested the dependency of each cerebral hemisphere on the remaining patent carotid artery by digital carotid compression, and in 41 of these patients we also tested the carbon dioxide reactivity in each hemisphere. Both hemispheric dependency and carbon dioxide reactivity were compared to 15 healthy controls. Mean blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery were lower on the occluded side than on the patent side (p less than 0.003). When the patent carotid artery was compressed middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities on the occluded side were mainly independent of the patent carotid artery, but on the patent side there was a high degree of dependency (p less than 0.0001). Carbon dioxide reactivity did not differ between the hemispheres, but in hemispheres with total dependency, carbon dioxide reactivity was inversely proportional to the severity of stenosis (r = -0.63). Tests of cerebral collateral reserve in patients with unilateral carotid occlusion evaluated by carotid compression and cerebral carbon dioxide reactivity may discriminate between survivors and potential nonsurvivors before the patent carotid artery occludes.",

    "abstract": "In immunologically defined National Institutes of Health miniswine, a segment of internal jugular vein was anastomosed to the carotid artery as an interposition graft. Patency of swine major histocompatibility complex matched, one haplotype mismatched, and complete mismatched veins was 9.8, 6.3, and 3.0 weeks respectively (p = 0.009). More than 90% of mismatched and 20% of matched allografts developed a positive crossmatch before occlusion (p = 0.006). The mixed lymphocyte response did not predict graft occlusion. Treatment of 10 swine with cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day) did not significantly improve patency for one haplotype mismatched grafts. In haplotype mismatched veins, cryopreserved grafts occluded more rapidly than noncryopreserved grafts: mean 2.4 versus 6.3 weeks, respectively (p = 0.002). In all cryopreserved vein grafts, alloantibody appeared at or after graft occlusion rather than before occlusion as seen with fresh allografts (p = 0.046). The mean patency of cryopreserved versus fresh autografts was 3.3 and greater than 32 weeks, respectively (p = 0.004). In summary, these results indicate that (1) allograft patency is related to the degree of swine major histocompatibility complex match and development of cytotoxic alloantibodies; (2) moderate-dose cyclosporine does not prolong allograft patency nor suppress development of antibody; (3) cryopreservation may accelerate graft occlusion through nonimmunologic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation has been suggested as an alternative treatment in patients with limb-threatening ischemia in whom vascular reconstructive surgery is not possible anymore. We studied the effects of epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation on microcirculatory blood flow in 20 patients with ischemic rest pain and ulcers. Angiography showed occluded crural arteries technically unsuitable for reconstructive surgery. Intravital capillary microscopy was used to assess capillary density and diameter and red blood cell velocity before and after a 1-minute period of arterial occlusion. After epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation 18 patients claimed immediate pain relief, which was confirmed by intravital capillary microscopy. Capillary density increased from 10 to 19/mm2 (p less than 0.001), red blood cell velocity increased from 0.088 to 0.496 mm/sec (p less than 0.001), and peak red blood cell velocity after arterial occlusion increased from 0.092 to 0.548 mm/sec (p less than 0.001). Two patients had no immediate pain relief; they did not show improvement of microcirculatory perfusion, and amputation was necessary. During the follow-up period (3 months to 3 years, mean 27 months), six other patients had recurrent ischemic pain, and amputation was necessary. In 12 patients pain relief continued, and ischemic ulcers healed; capillary microscopy confirmed improved microcirculatory blood flow. Microcirculatory parameters were significantly higher in respondents than in nonrespondents (p less than 0.001). Life-table analysis revealed a cumulative foot salvage of 80% and 56% after 1 and 2 years, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The titanium Greenfield filter was developed to facilitate operative and percutaneous insertion by a carrier (12F) smaller than that required for the standard stainless steel filter (24F). In preliminary clinical studies however, it proved to have an unacceptable rate of distal slippage and caval wall penetration. Therefore four modifications in hook design and base diameter have been tested in 20 sheep by implantation above and below the renal veins. In comparison to control titanium Greenfield filters (n = 8), neither changes in hook angle with smaller diameter base (type I, n = 4), elimination of limb flare (type II, n = 4), or 80 degree hook angle (type IV, n = 10) prevented migration and entry into venous tributaries or penetration. Penetration scores on the basis of autopsy findings did not correlate with antemortem predictions based on cavograms and showed 1.5 +/- 2.0/filter for controls, 1.0 +/- 1.15/filter for type I, 1.75 +/- 0.96/filter for type II and 1.67 +/- 1.37/filter for type IV. It was necessary to change the configuration of the hook completely to a recurved hook design providing a base pad for the 80 degree hook (type VI, n = 6) to limit migration and penetration with a score of 0.33 +/- 0.82/filter. Effects of experimental embolism were studied in six sheep (two acute, four chronic) and showed effective trapping by both type IV and type VI filters with no evidence of filter migration or damage to the caval wall. Persistent thrombus appeared to be caused by the remnants of oxidized cellulose used to induce thrombi, but there was no evidence of propagation proximal to the filter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The term sudden hearing loss refers to hearing losses of sensorineural origin that evolve over a short period of time and are often of unknown origin. Common causes include damage to the cochleovestibular nerve by viral infection, autoimmune disease, vascular insult, and labyrinthine membrane rupture. A 70-year-old man had a history of recent diplopia, dysarthria, syncopal episodes, dysequilibrium, and the sudden onset of deafness in his right ear. Angiography demonstrated severe ulcerative stenosis of the right internal carotid origin and an anomalous vessel (probable remnant of hypoglossal artery) originating from the distal right internal carotid artery that perfused the entire distal vertebral and basilar artery circulation. Arch angiograms confirmed the absence of a proximal right vertebral artery and revealed a small left vertebral artery that ended in the cervical region without reaching the posterior fossa. Standard right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty resolved all neurologic symptoms except for persistent unilateral deafness at 9 months' follow-up. Presumed embolization through this anomalous vessel to the internal auditory artery and subsequent cochlear and vestibular branches represents the first reported case of sudden hearing loss as a result of anterior circulatory ulcerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Distal internal carotid artery exposure can be technically demanding even for experienced vascular surgeons. Although a variety of techniques have been described to facilitate such exposure, temporary mandibular subluxation has emerged as the simplest and least debilitating approach. Current techniques for maintaining temporary mandibular subluxation during distal internal carotid artery procedures, including maxillomandibular arch bar fixation and circummandibular/transnasal wiring, have been time consuming and associated with complications. Over the last 4 years a new simplified technique of temporary mandibular subluxation fixation has been used in 14 patients requiring distal internal carotid exposure. Indications for operation included extended carotid endarterectomy (8), carotid body tumor excision (2), repair of distal internal carotid artery trauma (2), and repair of postendarterectomy pseudoaneurysm (2). Among patients with healthy teeth, unilateral temporary mandibular subluxation was maintained by interdental wiring from the ipsilateral mandibular bicuspids to the contralateral maxillary bicuspids. In edentulous patients or those with chronic periodontal disease, temporary mandibular subluxation was maintained with diagonal wiring between maxillary and mandibular Steinmann pins. No instances of malocclusion, dental injury, or local infection were observed. Transient postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction was observed in three patients. Transient ipsilateral temporomandibular joint pain occurred in three patients. Two patients developed permanent cranial nerve injuries unrelated to temporary mandibular subluxation. These data suggest that temporary mandibular subluxation by diagonal interdental/Steinmann pin wiring is safe, expeditious, and effective in facilitating exposure of the distal internal carotid artery.",

    "abstract": "Primary venous aneurysms are infrequently noted and rarely have clinical significance. An important exception, however, is an aneurysm of the popliteal vein that is known to be a source for pulmonary emboli. We present the case of a previously healthy 57-year-old man with recurrent episodes of occult pulmonary embolism. Initial diagnostic investigations were compatible with multiple pulmonary emboli, but no source was identified. Subsequently, an indium 111-labeled platelet scan confirmed a site of active thrombus formation in the right lower extremity above the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging defined a saccular aneurysm of the popliteal vein, which was confirmed by contrast venography. Thereafter, the patient had resection of the venous aneurysm and tangential venorrhaphy. After operation duplex scanning confirmed patency of the venous repair. This is the eleventh report in the English-language literature of pulmonary emboli suspected of having originated from a popliteal venous aneurysm.",

During a 3 1/2-year period from January 1985 through June 1988, 4988 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures were performed at Emory University Hospital. All patients were given heparin during the cardiac intervention, and all had a catheter introducer left in place for several hours after completion of the procedure. Fifty-five iatrogenic vascular complications developed in 52 patients (1%), resulting in 54 corrective operations. Pseudoaneurysm, the most frequent complication, was seen in 35 patients (64%). This was followed by arteriovenous fistula in eight (15%), uncontrolled hemorrhage in six (11%), arterial thrombosis in three (6%), peripheral embolization in two (4%), and bowel ischemia in one patient. The outcome of surgical therapy in the entire group was quite acceptable with no operative mortality, no extremity amputation, and a 7.4% complication rate. Variables that correlated with an increased risk of peripheral vascular problems after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty included advanced age, female gender, thrombolytic therapy, and postprocedural anticoagulation. Variables that did not appear to correlate were hypertension, diabetes, prior percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, antiplatelet therapy, or the size of the guiding catheter used.",

    "abstract": "Eighty patients with upper extremity vascular trauma were treated during a 4-year period. Of 123 vascular injuries, 95 were arterial, 1 was primary venous, and 27 were associated venous injuries. Causes included penetrating (64%), blunt (27%), and iatrogenic injuries (9%). Arteries injured were ulnar (34), radial (28), brachial (22), subclavian (6), and axillary (5). Numbers of patients with associated injuries were nerve (53), vein (27), bone (23), and soft tissue injuries (60). The most common techniques of arterial repair were end-to-end anastomosis (50), followed by interposition saphenous vein grafting (40). Fasciotomy was used in 36 patients. Two arterial repairs failed during surgery and required revision (1) or thrombectomy (1). One radial artery repair thrombosed during late follow-up, with maintenance of normal extremity perfusion via the ulnar artery. No amputations were required, and 83% of all patients treated for nerve injuries resolved or improved their neurologic deficits. Two or more operations for surgical debridement and subsequent wound closure were required in 35 patients. This study supports an aggressive approach to diagnosis and treatment of complex upper extremity vascular trauma emphasizing meticulous surgical technique, liberal use of fasciotomy, and aggressive intraoperative debridement and repair of associated injuries.",

    "abstract": "With multilevel arteriosclerosis, some patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass grafting will develop femoral/brachial pressure gradients only after the bypass is performed. We therefore evaluated arteriographically alternate inflow sites and measured the femoral/brachial pressure gradients before and after placement of 87 femorofemoral and 510 femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypasses. No prebypass femoral/brachial pressure gradients were present with and without intraarterial papaverine. However, femoral/branchial pressure gradients greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg were observed after the bypass placement in 16 femorofemoral patients and 43 femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal patients. Gradients averaged 28 +/- 8 (SD) (range, 15 to 50) mm Hg. The post femorofemoral bypass gradients were treated by immediate supplementary inflow extension to the aorta (three patients) or an axillary artery (three patients); by postoperative iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (four patients) or by no treatment (six patients with femoral/brachial pressure gradients of 15 to 35 [23 +/- 5] mm Hg). The 43 postfemoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypass gradients were treated by immediate supplementary inflow extension to the contralateral femoral artery (15 patients), the aorta (8 patients), or an axillary artery (3 patients); by postoperative iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (5 patients) or by no treatment (12 patients with femoral/brachial pressure gradients of 15 to 30 [21 +/- 4] mm Hg). No thrombosis occurred in the 10 femorofemoral bypasses with postbypass femoral/brachial pressure gradients that were treated. One of the six femorofemoral patients with untreated gradients required a subsequent aortic extension, and one thrombosed after 2 years. Of the 12 untreated patients with femoropopliteal/infrapopliteal bypasses one graft occluded early, and two late failures occurred 12 and 18 months later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Forty patients with diabetes mellitus and severe mal perforans underwent dorsal excision of the involved metatarsal head with primary closure of the plantar ulcer. Patients were screened before operation with noninvasive studies documenting pulse examination, ankle pressure index, and toe blood pressures. Fifteen of 40 patients (38%) had no palpable pedal pulses. Three patients had vascular reconstruction before metatarsal head resection. Mean toe pressure of the entire group was 135 +/- 35 mm Hg (range, 60 to 190), with six patients having a pressure less than 100 mm Hg. All patients had primary healing of the plantar wound and secondary healing of the dorsal incision with no amputations or readmissions for forefoot sepsis in the mean follow-up of 38.5 months (range, 2 to 54 months). In seven patients with recurrent ulcers, no relationship was found between measured indexes of forefoot perfusion and recurrence. However, all patients with recurrence were noncompliant in returning for follow-up orthotic care. This technique provides a means to ensure rapid healing of severe mal perforans while decreasing hospitalization, wound care, and periods of immobilization and is applicable in diabetic patients with arterial insufficiency and toe pressure of at least 60 mm Hg.",

    "abstract": "We retrospectively reviewed the results of 108 consecutive femorocrural bypasses performed with prosthetic/autogenous composite graft material and compared these with the results of 57 crural bypasses using greater saphenous vein by the in situ technique. Indication for operation in all cases was the salvage of an otherwise imminently threatened limb. Polytetrafluoroethylene-composite grafts (n = 87) and human umbilical vein-composite grafts (n = 21) were placed only in patients lacking suitable autogenous material for in-line reconstruction. Patient groups were similar with respect to mean age, prevalence of arterial disease risk factors, quality of the distal runoff, and location of the distal anastomosis. Cumulative patency rates at 1 year by life-table analysis were 81.9%, 34.6%, and 12.1% for the in situ, polytetrafluoroethylene-composite and human umbilical vein-composite groups, respectively. At 2 years these were 63.9%, 29.9%, and 6.0%, respectively (p less than 0.025). Cumulative limb salvage at 1 year was 70.6%, 62.3%, and 32.7%, respectively. Wound-related complications occurred in 52.4% of human umbilical vein-composite, 38.6% of in situ, and 18.3% of polytetrafluoroethylene-composite bypasses (p less than 0.05). On the basis of these results, we conclude that femorocrural bypass with polytetrafluoroethylene-composite graft is an acceptable form of distal reconstruction for limb salvage in patients lacking sufficient lengths of autogenous vein. We no longer use human umbilical vein for composite construction.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether aneurysms form in experimental diet-induced atherosclerosis, we reviewed our experience with cynomolgus monkeys (n = 268) and rhesus monkeys (n = 175) fed an atherogenic diet for various lengths of time. Many animals in long-term experiments were fed \"regression\" diets and cholestyramine to lower cholesterol levels after lesions were established. No aneurysms were found in animals on normal diet. There were no aneurysms in 252 animals fed an atherogenic diet with or without regression for 12 months or less. However, aneurysms formed in 13% of cynomolgus monkeys (4 of 31) and 1% (1 of 107) rhesus monkeys on an atherogenic regimen for 16 to 24 months. Four of the five animals with aneurysms were on a regression diet and cholestyramine for 4 to 12 months. The fifth was fed the atherogenic diet for 20 months without subsequent regression. Aneurysms were prominent and involved the thoracic and abdominal aorta, innominate artery, carotid arteries, iliac and femoral arteries, and formed in areas most involved with plaque formation in both species. Histologic evidence was found of thinning of the media and atrophy with loss of normal architecture. The higher incidence of aneurysms in cynomolgus monkeys was associated with greater media destruction than was noted in the rhesus. These data support the thesis that aneurysm formation is a manifestation of atherosclerosis. In primate atherosclerosis, aneurysms form only after prolonged exposure to the atherogenic regimen, even in the presence of declining serum cholesterol levels. Matrix fibers in plaques may provide structural support to the aortic wall where there is underlying atrophy of the media. With time or declining serum cholesterol levels or both, plaques may atrophy leaving an aortic wall too thin to support increasing mural tension, leading to aneurysmal enlargement.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of our article is to describe a patient with severe hypertension and moderate renal insufficiency, unstable angina, and a 6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. A previous aortogram had demonstrated severe bilateral renal artery stenoses. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe coronary disease. After cardiac catheterization acute renal failure and pulmonary edema requiring dialysis developed in the patient. In addition, evidence of impending myocardial necrosis developed. Because of the critical nature of the myocardial and renal ischemia it was necessary to perform combined myocardial and renal revascularization rather than staged procedures. At the time of coronary artery bypass grafting, a vein graft was anastomosed to the right coronary artery vein graft and tunneled through the diaphragm into the abdomen to revascularize both renal arteries. After surgery renal function gradually improved, and no further dialysis was required. The abdominal aortic aneurysm was repaired at a subsequent operation. At 2-year follow-up all grafts remained patent. The serum creatinine is 1.2 mg/dl. Although most patients with combined coronary artery disease and renal artery disease can be treated with staged operations, our procedure may be of value in patients in whom staged procedure are not feasible and in whom the infrarenal aorta is severely diseased or aneurysmal.",

    "abstract": "The Syme amputation is an old operation that has been used during this century primarily as a means of treating traumatic injuries to the forefoot in military patients. In 1984 we made a deliberate attempt to perform the operation in a highly selective group of dysvascular patients with forefoot necrosis who happened to have a palpable posterior tibial pulse. We reviewed the charts of 26 patients who underwent a one-stage (3 patients) or two-stage (23 patients) Syme amputation. The mean age was 60 years, (range 32 to 74 years). There were 17 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, and 3 diet-controlled diabetic patients. Twenty-two patients (85%) had a palpable posterior tibial pulse before surgery. Fourteen patients (54%) underwent a preliminary Ray (4) or transmetatarsal (10) amputation to rid the forefoot of an active infection. Overall, 20 patients (77%) had successful Syme amputations. Nineteen of 22 patients (85%) with a palpable posterior tibial pulse had a successful amputation in contrast to one out of four patients (25%) who did not have a palpable pulse before surgery (p = 0.04). The mean follow-up of all patients was 23 months. The durability of the operation was demonstrated in finding that only one patient in 20 initially successful Syme amputations required revision to the below-knee level. The two-stage Syme amputation can be a very gratifying operation with success rates approaching 85%, even if offered to elderly diabetic patients. The single most important feature for success is to limit the operation to those patients with a palpable posterior tibial pulse before operation.",

    "abstract": "Routine follow-up of patients after carotid endarterectomy with duplex scanning is commonly practiced, yet the clinical significance of identifying those with asymptomatic restenosis is unclear. To address this issue we reviewed 120 consecutive patients who underwent 143 carotid endarterectomies from August 1983 to December 1988. One hundred one patients (118 operations) were available for clinical follow-up, and the overall incidence of recurrent symptoms was 6% (6/101). Sixty-three of these patients (78 carotid endarterectomies) had postoperative duplex examination. Two had evidence of residual disease from the time of surgery and were not included in further analysis. Significant recurrent stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) developed in 14 of the remaining 76 arteries (18.2%). Twelve of 14 stenoses remained asymptomatic during follow-up from 18 to 72 months (mean 47.0 months) and did not undergo reoperation. Recurrent ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms developed in two patients with restenosis (14.3%). Four of the 62 arteries without significant recurrent stenosis developed ipsilateral symptoms (6.5%), but none required reoperation during follow-up from 1 to 71 months (mean 31.6 months). Life-table analysis showed no increased risk of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or death in patients with restenosis. This study supports regular clinical follow-up after carotid endarterectomy with emphasis on patient education in the recognition of symptoms. Although duplex scanning may be useful to follow known contralateral asymptomatic disease or evaluate those with recurrent symptoms, its routine use to identify patients with asymptomatic restenosis after carotid endarterectomy may be unnecessary.",

Stenoses were identified in 15 (20%) of 76 grafts evaluated for screening purposes. Seven of these had confirmatory arteriograms, and five were revised. The remaining eight grafts with suspected stenoses were followed without angiography, and four (50%) subsequently failed. Only two (3.3%) of 61 grafts with normal scan outcomes have thrombosed. Fistulas were identified in 12 (37%) of 32 in situ grafts evaluated. Nine grafts with previously suspected problems based on decreased ankle-brachial indexes were scanned, and an explanation was found, confirmed by angiogram, and corrected in six. Detection of unsuspected stenoses in five grafts requiring revision and four grafts that later thrombosed without revision, as well as identification of fistulas in 37% of in situ grafts, confirms the importance of color-flow imaging as a screening tool.",

    "abstract": "With the exception of conventional angiography, no previously proposed screening test has the necessary sensitivity/specificity to guide further evaluation for correctable renovascular disease. Recently, renal duplex sonography has been suggested as a useful substitute in such screening for renovascular disease. This report analyzes our data collected over the past 10 months in evaluation of renal duplex sonography to examine its diagnostic value. The study population for renal duplex sonography validity analysis consisted of 74 consecutive patients who had 77 comparative renal duplex sonography and standard angiographic studies of the arterial anatomy to 148 kidneys. Renal duplex sonography results from six kidneys (4%) were considered inadequate for interpretation. This study population contained 26 patients (35%) with severe renal insufficiency (mean 3.6 mg/dl) and 67 hypertension (91%). Fourteen patients (19%) had 20 kidneys with multiple renal arteries. Bilateral disease was present in 22 of the 44 patients with significant renovascular disease. Renal duplex sonography correctly identified the presence of renovascular disease in 41 of 44 patients with angiographically proven lesions, and renovascular disease was not identified in any patient free of disease. When single renal arteries were present (122 kidneys), renal duplex sonography provided 93% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 98% positive predictive value, 94% negative predictive value, and an overall accuracy of 96%. These results were adversely affected when kidneys with multiple (polar) renal arteries were examined. Although the end diastolic ratio was inversely correlated with serum creatinine (r = -0.3073, p = 0.009), low end diastolic ratio in 35 patients submitted to renovascular reconstruction did not preclude beneficial blood pressure or renal function response. We conclude from this analysis that renal duplex sonography can be a valuable screening test in the search for correctable renovascular disease causing global renal ischemia and secondary renal insufficiency (ischemic nephropathy). Renal duplex sonography does not, however, exclude polar vessel renovascular disease causing hypertension alone nor does it predict hypertension or renal function response after correction of renovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The case of an 18-month-old male who underwent a right hepatic lobectomy for hepatoblastoma with extensive involvement of the retrohepatic vena cava is presented. The retrohepatic vena cava was replaced with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft. This graft was proved patent by ultrasonography 2 years after operation. The child has no evidence of recurrent hepatoblastoma. The results of grafting the retrohepatic vena cava have been notoriously poor. It is widely believed that a prosthetic vena cava graft cannot be expected to remain patent. Our experience with polytetrafluoroethylene and previous reports using Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene have shown that long-term patency of retrohepatic vena cava replacement with synthetic graft can be successful.",

    "abstract": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) from vascular endothelium may play a key role in the genesis of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the ability of this tissue to synthesize LTB4 is controversial. To resolve this issue arachidonic acid metabolism was characterized in cultures of confluent monolayers of a rabbit aortic endothelial cell line by use of both high-pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 with 5% fetal bovine serum. Lipoxygenase activity was studied by placing the cells in Hank's balanced salt solution with 2 mumol/L indomethacin. After 30 minutes preincubation with indomethacin cells were exposed to either arachidonic acid (10 mumol/L) or arachidonic acid labeled with radioactive carbon (14C) (1 microCi; SA 58 mCi/mmol) and then stimulated with 9.5 mumol/L calcium ionophore A23187 for 55 minutes. Studies of the cyclooxygenase activity were performed without preincubating with indomethacin. Samples were prepared for high-pressure liquid chromatography by evaporation to dryness under a vacuum and resuspending in 2 ml of 1:1 methanol/water. Tritium-labeled standards were added before loading the 14C-labeled samples on the column. Radiolabeled arachidonic acid metabolites were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and detected by means of a dual channel flow-through radiodetector that monitors both 14C and 3H. Based on coelution with authentic standards three lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid have been identified: LTB4, 12- and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraneoic acid. Leukotriene B4 was further characterized by ultraviolet spectral analysis and inhibition studies with use of nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Quantitation was facilitated by commercially available radioimmunoassay kits. An average of 600 pg LTB4/10(6) cells was measured from separate experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To determine the benefit of carotid patch angioplasty, a retrospective study of 1000 consecutive carotid endarterectomies was done. Based on the type of carotid endarterectomy closure, patients were divided into four groups: 250 had primary closure, 250 had expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch, 250 had Dacron patch, and 250 had saphenous vein patch. On the basis of operative technique or type of carotid artery closure, no statistical difference was found in the incidence of postoperative stroke (p greater than 0.25): primary closure 1.6% (4), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 2.0% (5), Dacron patch 1.6% (4), and saphenous vein patch (0). Postoperative carotid patency was determined by B-mode ultrasonography, and 717 patients were evaluated in follow-up extending to 6 years (mean 37.8 months). Based on the method of carotid endarterectomy closure, no significant difference (p greater than 0.25) was found in the incidence of significant restenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction): primary closure 4.0% (7), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 4.0% (6), Dacron 5.4% (9), and saphenous vein 1.0% (2). Significant restenosis was most frequent in habitual smokers (93%, 25/28) and females (78%, 22/28) despite the method of carotid endarterectomy closure. No statistical difference was found in the incidence of late ipsilateral stroke either (p greater than 0.25): primary closure 2.9% (5), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 2% (3), Dacron 5% (3), and saphenous vein 0%. These results indicate that the incidence of postoperative stroke, regardless of method of arterial closure, was not statistically different. The method of carotid closure did not appear to affect the occurrence of late ipsilateral stroke or restenosis; however, patch angioplasty with saphenous vein appears appropriate in habitual smokers, and likely in patients with small internal carotid arteries.",

    "abstract": "Dilation is the most common inherent \"failure mode\" of knitted Dacron aortic prostheses. However, the incidence of graft failure related to dilation is unknown because of insufficient data regarding the occurrence, degree, and prognostic significance of postoperative alterations in graft size. In 1979 we reported that postoperative ultrasonic examinations in 95 asymptomatic patients, selected at random after aortic surgery, revealed dilation of the aortic portion of knitted Dacron bifurcation grafts. The average follow-up was 33 months, and the mean dilation was 18%. This article provides the results of a later follow-up, averaging 175 months, in 32 patients from the 1979 study. CT scanning, rather than ultrasonic imaging, was used to evaluate all parts of the grafts. CT scans disclosed that the three parts of each graft dilated, but the parts did not always dilate uniformly. Mean percent dilation values for the entire series were aortic portion 67% +/- 38% SD; right limb 77% +/- 66% SD; left limb 54% +/- 26% SD. Maximum percent dilation for any part of the grafts ranged from 26% to 367% with a mean of 94%. At least one part of the grafts dilated 100% or greater in 12 patients. Three patients had generalized and saccular dilation of the aortic portion of the prostheses and an anastomotic aortic aneurysm; one patient had a localized aneurysm in the midportion of the right limb. Three of the latter grafts were replaced with woven Dacron prostheses.",

    "abstract": "A 65-year-old woman sought treatment for sentinel upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Three years previously she had undergone graft replacement of her ascending aorta for aneurysm. In the interim she was followed for chronic dissection of her remaining aorta, and 6 months before this admission she had undergone graft replacement of a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. Arteriography and CT scanning of the thorax revealed an 8 cm aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta. Operation was undertaken at which time an aortoesophageal fistula, as a result of erosion of the aneurysm into the esophagus, was identified. The descending thoracic aortic aneurysm was replaced with a Dacron tube graft, the esophageal defect was repaired primarily, and a viable pedicle flap of omentum was used to reinforce the esophageal repair and cover the aortic graft. Her postoperative recovery was free of infection but complicated by rapid expansion of the upper abdominal aorta at the visceral arterial level. Eight weeks after initial operation she underwent graft replacement of her remaining thoracoabdominal aorta with direct reattachment of her celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and both renal arteries. Recovery after her second procedure was uneventful, and she continues to do well at 13 months after operation. Development of a primary aortoesophageal fistula caused by aneurysms of the aorta is a rare but lethal complication. We present a technique for treatment of primary aortoesophageal fistula using omentum and preservation of gastrointestinal continuity as a one-stage operation. It is possible in selected cases to manage the esophageal perforation with primary closure and omental coverage to achieve healing free of infection without temporary or permanent discontinuity of the gastrointestinal tract.",

    "abstract": "Clinical study of carotid artery laser endarterectomy began April 15, 1988. This report describes the first 10 cases that were performed in nine patients (five men and four women, mean age 70 years). Indications were asymptomatic stenosis (5), transient ischemic attacks (4), and stroke in evolution (1). There were two emergency cases and eight elective cases (including one reoperative case). Surgical exposure, systemic heparinization, vascular control, and a longitudinal arteriotomy were used. The cleavage plane between atheromas and media was developed with argon ion laser radiation (488 and 514.5 nm) directed through a 300 microns quartz fiber at power 1.0 W. Laser radiation was used to cut the atheromas out of the arteries and weld the end points. Residual atheromatous debris were vaporized with individual laser exposures. Arteriotomies were closed with sutures, and blood flow was restored. The endarterectomies were 3.9 +/- 1.1 cm long and required 330 +/- 97 joules. Mean clamp time was 22.5 +/- 7.9 minutes. Shunts were used in two cases. There were no arterial perforations or injuries as a result of laser light. Complications were hematoma (1), respiratory arrest (1), and transient neurologic deficit (1). Carotid endarterectomy is technically feasible with argon ion laser radiation. In the present series, postoperative observations, averaging 12 months and ranging from 5 to 19 months, have shown satisfactory results. No angiographic follow-up examinations were carried out.",

    "abstract": "External iliac fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare and usually asymptomatic disorder. We report eight symptomatic patients seen over a 15-year period and review pathophysiologic mechanisms accounting for the three following distinct lower extremity ischemic sequelae: (1) Emboli--episodic focal digital ischemia (blue toe) was seen in three patients. Resection and primary anastomosis of focal iliac ulcerative fibromuscular dysplasia (one patient) or resection and replacement (two patients) removed the embolic source and relieved the symptoms. (2) Chronic ischemia--gradual onset of full leg claudication in four patients was treated by operative graduated intraluminal dilation in three patients and prosthetic bypass in one. Arteriography subsequently showed a remodeled lumen in the three patients who underwent dilation. (3) Dissection--acute onset leg ischemia resulted from presumed dissection of the external iliac segment. After 4 months of conservative management of antiplatelet agents and exercise, symptoms resolved completely, and arteriogram showed spontaneous restoration of a normal lumen in the dissected segment. The clinical presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia may mimic other arterial processes such as atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is made only by arteriography with specific magnification views of the external iliac arteries and careful surveillance of the renal arteries. Appropriate treatment should be tailored to the clinical presenting symptom. For microembolic disease, resection and replacement are required. For chronic ischemia, intraluminal dilation is generally sufficient and durable and has proved to be a simpler and acceptable alternative to replacement or bypass. In acute dissection, surgical intervention may be deferred if the limb is viable to allow spontaneous healing and remodeling. Persistent symptoms may be the only indication for intervention in this ischemic manifestation of external iliac fibromuscular dysplasia.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine if the adventitial vasa vasorum contribute to re-endothelialization of the canine carotid artery after removal of the endothelial flow surface. Casting studies demonstrated that vasa vasorum are present only in the adventitia of the canine carotid artery. Ninety autograft segments of the carotid artery from which the endothelium had been removed were implanted in both carotid arteries of 45 dogs. Glutaraldehyde-processed canine carotid allografts were positioned at each end to prevent pannus ingrowth and a Gore-Tex wrap to prevent periarterial tissue growth was placed into the outer wall. Three methods were used, with observations at 4 and 8 weeks. In method 1 the test segment was treated with superficial endarterectomy. In method 2 a balloon catheter was used to remove the endothelium. In method 3 balloon catheter denudation of the flow surface was also employed and, in addition, the adventitia was removed surgically as completely as possible, although a few vasa vasorum were shown to remain in some grafts. In method 1 all the patent endarterectomized arteries were partially re-endothelialized at both the 4- and 8-week intervals. In method 2, 72% of the balloon-denuded patent arteries with intact adventitial vasa vasorum were partially re-endothelialized at 4 weeks and 84% at 8 weeks. However, in method 3 the flow surfaces had no endothelium at 4 weeks and 83% still had none at 8 weeks. These findings suggest that, in the absence of pannus ingrowth, re-endothelialization of the canine carotid artery depends on not only the presence but also the number of adventitial vasa vasorum.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the efficacy of anticoagulation in preventing continuing thrombosis, we prospectively evaluated 24 patients with acute deep venous thrombosis using duplex ultrasonography. All patients were hospitalized with conclusive ultrasonic evidence of deep venous thrombosis identified in one of four levels: I, calf only; II, calf-popliteal; III, calf-popliteal-femoral; or IV, calf-popliteal-femoral-iliac. Duplex scans were obtained on admission and on three subsequent occasions during therapy. Progression of thrombosis was defined as advancement of thrombus to the more proximal venous level. Demographic data, symptoms, risk factors for deep venous thrombosis, physical findings, anticoagulation regimens, and hematologic variables were ascertained. Adequacy of anticoagulation was defined as elevation of baseline activated partial thromboplastin time by 150%. Nine patients (38%) had progression of thrombosis, and 15 (62%) had stable or improving duplex scans. Progression occurred as follows: I----II (2), I----III (2), II----III (1), and III----IV (4). Of the demographic and clinical variables examined, only smoking correlated with progression of thrombus (p = 0.04). Average heparin dose in the stable group was 1214 +/- 294 units/hr and 1122 +/- 248 units/hr in the group that progressed (p = 0.8): activated partial thromboplastin time was 45.6 +/- 7 seconds in the stable group and 49.8 +/- 9 seconds in the progression group (p = 0.7). Nine patients in the stable group had consistently adequate anticoagulation, whereas six did not; six in the progression group were consistently anticoagulated, and three were not. Two patients (one with stable thrombus and one with progressive thrombus) suffered nonfatal pulmonary emboli. Clot progression as determined by duplex scanning did not predict acute complications of deep venous thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the role of duplex scanning in the management of patients with normal or minimally diseases carotid arteries. Carotid duplex scans were interpreted according to previously established criteria and considered normal when pulsed Doppler spectral waveforms showed laminar flow or only minor flow disturbances. Normal flow patterns were noted by duplex scanning in 100 carotid bifurcations of 72 patients who also underwent carotid arteriography. Neurologic symptoms (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or stroke) were present in relation to 23 arteries and absent in relation to 77 arteries. On the 23 symptomatic sides arteriography was interpreted as normal in eight, 1% to 15% stenosis in 14, and 16% to 40% stenosis in one. For the 77 asymptomatic sides, arteriography showed normal vessels in 15, 1% to 15% stenosis in 43, and 16% to 40% stenosis in 19. One symptomatic patient was treated by carotid endarterectomy for an irregular 1% to 15% stenosis. None of the asymptomatic lesions were in the range of 80% to 99% stenosis, which would justify endarterectomy for asymptomatic disease. Clinical follow-up for a mean interval of 28 months on 20 of the 22 symptomatic patients not undergoing surgery revealed no strokes and transient recurrent symptoms in two patients. Assuming that the single operation in this study was indicated, duplex scanning correctly identified lesions not requiring carotid endarterectomy in 96% (22/23) of the symptomatic patients. A normal duplex scan also predicted a benign clinical outcome without operation. Duplex scanning can reliably exclude surgically treatable carotid bifurcation lesions in asymptomatic patients, and endarterectomy is rarely indicated in symptomatic patients with normal duplex scan results. This study supports a nonoperative therapeutic approach for most patients with neurologic symptoms and a normal carotid duplex scan on the appropriate side.",

    "abstract": "The influence of neutralizing or not neutralizing heparin after carotid endarterectomy on postoperative stroke and wound hematoma is unknown. During the past 6 years some of the authors frequently gave protamine sulfate to neutralize heparin, whereas others did not unless a patch was used or wound hemostasis was not readily obtained. To determine the influence of protamine sulfate on stroke and wound hematoma the records of 697 patients having a carotid endarterectomy from January 1984 to September 1989 were reviewed. Protamine sulfate was given to 328 patients, and 369 did not receive protamine sulfate. The incidence of stroke in the two groups was 1.8% (n = 6) and 2.7% (n = 10), respectively, and the difference was not significant (p = 0.6019). Excluding three strokes that could not be related to neutralizing or not neutralizing heparin, the difference remained insignificant (1.5% vs 2.2%, p = 0.7290). The incidence of wound hematoma was 1.8% (n = 6) in patients given protamine sulfate and 6.5% (n = 24) in patients not given protamine sulfate, and this difference was significant (p = 0.0044). The difference remained significant when three hematomas not related to protamine sulfate were excluded (1.2% vs 6.2%, p = 0.0013). In patients not given protamine sulfate draining the wound lessened the incidence of wound hematoma (4.4% vs 8.6%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1475). In patients given protamine sulfate the dose of protamine sulfate (15 to 45 mg vs 50 to 75 mg) had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of stroke (0.8% vs 2.0%, p = 0.6530) or wound hematoma (1.6% vs 1.0%, p = 1.000).",

Partial distal removal showed better preservation of residual greater saphenous vein than partial proximal removal, with greater preservation of \"usable\" length and greater average diameter. Compared to contralateral unoperated legs, partial distal removal, partial proximal removal, and total removal all showed a similar degree of compensatory lesser saphenous vein enlargement. High ligation showed no lesser saphenous vein enlargement but showed the best greater saphenous vein preservation, none had less than 85% preservation of potential length. Combining residual greater saphenous vein and lesser saphenous vein segments of usable caliber, 100% of high ligation, 93% of partial distal removal, and 74% of partial proximal removal had greater than 60 cm total length, and most total removal had greater than 40 cm usable residual lesser saphenous vein. Previous saphenous vein surgery should not categorically exclude patients as having no usable residual ipsilateral vein for bypass. Partial distal removal allows better preservation of length and caliber of residual greater saphenous vein than proximal harvest, with both showing equivalent lesser saphenous vein enlargement to those with total greater saphenous vein removal. High ligation, performed for early tributary varicosities, in patients with saphenofemoral but no perforator incompetence, gives excellent preservation of residual greater saphenous vein length and caliber.

    "abstract": "Sixty patients with iliofemoral occlusive disease were treated by autogenous anatomic reconstruction by endarterectomy. Endarterectomy was performed extra-peritoneally by the eversion technique. The operative technique and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Six patients had postoperative complications of acute anastomotic hemorrhage (two patients), would hematoma (two patients), and atelectasis (two patients). Sixty patients discharged with patient arterial reconstruction were followed up from 5 months to 17 1/2 years, with a mean follow-up of 53 months. There were no other vascular complications. Seventy limbs were at risk during this period, with an accumulative patency rate of 80.4% at 5 years and 71.4% at 10 years. There were 11 occlusions of the external iliac artery and one stenosis of the common femoral artery. Failures occurred mainly in the external iliac artery, which appears to be the limiting factor in the continued patency of endarterectomy. There were 18 deaths (30%). Nine deaths were attributed to the complications of arteriosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the feasibility of forming vascular anastomoses by use of argon laser tissue fusion and absorbable, monofilament polydimethylsiloxane guy sutures. In initial animal studies femoral arteriovenous fistulas approximately 1.5 cm in length were created bilaterally in each of 10 dogs and were studied histologically at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks (two animals in each interval). In each animal, one anastomosis (control) was formed with continuous 6-0 polypropylene suture, and the contralateral anastomosis (experimental) was performed with an argon laser (0.5 watt, 5 to 7 minutes exposure, energy fluence 1100 to 1500 joules/cm2 per 1 cm length) with stay sutures of 5-0 polydimethylsiloxane at 0.5 to 0.65 cm intervals. At removal, all anastomoses were patent without hematomas, aneurysms, or luminal narrowing. Histologic examination at 2 to 16 weeks demonstrated resorption of the biodegradable suture material by a local inflammatory reaction. By 24 weeks, laser-fused specimens had no evidence of suture material at the anastomotic line, and healing consisted of a bond between artery and vein wall tissues. Control suture specimens at the same intervals exhibited an organized fibrous tissue response to the suture. Clinical adaptability of this technology has subsequently been evaluated in five patients at 10 to 27 months (21.6 +/- 5.8) by physical examination and duplex scanning and demonstrate no evidence of abnormal healing. This study establishes the experimental and preliminary clinical feasibility of laser-fused anastomoses aligned by biodegradable guy sutures and supports further investigation and refinement of the technique.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent symptoms develop in 15% to 20% of patients undergoing either first rib resection or scalenectomy for thoracic outlet syndrome. Over the past 22 years 134 operations for recurrence were performed in 97 patients. Four operations were used: transaxillary first rib resection (26); supraclavicular first rib resection with neurolysis (15); scalenectomy with neurolysis (58); and brachial plexus neurolysis (35). Complications included temporary plexus injury (0.7%), temporary phrenic palsy (3.7%), and permanent phrenic palsy (1.4%). The combined primary success rate of all four operations for recurrence was 84% in the first 3 months. This fell to 59% at 1 to 2 years; 50% at 3 to 5 years; and 41% at 10 to 15 years. No significant difference was found in results between the four operations used for recurrence. When recurrence was caused by trauma the results of reoperations were better than when recurrence was spontaneous. The primary success rates of three initial operations for thoracic outlet syndrome were compared to their secondary success rates (improved after reoperation). By use of life-table methods, reoperation improved the 5- to 10-year success rate of transaxillary first rib resection from 69% to 86% and for scalenectomy from 69% to 84%. Reoperation is successful in most cases of recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome and better when recurrence is the result of a neck injury.",

An average of 3.2 postoperative duplex graft flow velocity (GFV) measurements per graft was obtained during a mean follow-up interval of 21 1/2 months. Only 2.1% of 280 grafts with GFV measurements greater than 45 cm/sec failed within 6 months of a normal surveillance examination. GFV measurements less than 45 cm/sec in 99 grafts led to arteriography in 75 grafts, identifying 50 stenotic lesions in 48 bypasses (12.6% of series). Inflow lesions were present in 5%, outflow stenoses in 2%, and intrinsic graft stenoses in only 6% of bypasses. Only 29% of grafts identified as failing by duplex scan were associated with a reduction in ankle-brachial index of greater than 0.15. Secondary reconstructions were performed in 48 grafts based on detection of a reduced GFV measurement; all such reconstructions are patent after a mean follow-up of 5 months. Duplex surveillance is more reliable in identification of failing vein grafts than is determination of ankle-brachial index.",

The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%.

Variable results have been reported after medical and surgical management. Twenty female patients with Takayasu's arteritis were treated from 1973 to 1989. Eleven (55%) patients had hypertension. Upper or lower extremity ischemia was present in 12 (60%) patients and cerebrovascular insufficiency in seven (35%). Nine patients initially managed with corticosteroids had no improvement in signs or symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Eleven patients had 16 vascular procedures for the following indications: renovascular hypertension (6), extremity ischemia (5), cerebrovascular insufficiency (2), dilation ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency (1), thoracic aortic aneurysm (1), abdominal aortic aneurysm (1). Procedures included aortorenal bypass (5), carotid-subclavian, axillary, or brachial bypass (4), aorto-carotid bypass (2), aneurysm resection (2), supra-celiac aorto-femoral bypass (1), ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (1), and nephrectomy (1). Clinical improvement occurred in all patients. There were no operative deaths. All are alive at a mean follow-up of 5.75 years (6 months to 16 years). Revision of the initial reconstruction has been required for recurrent renovascular hypertension in one patient and extremity ischemia in another. The other nine patients remain symptomatically improved. Symptomatic Takayasu's arteritis frequently requires arterial reconstruction. Symptomatic improvement and excellent long-term graft patency can be expected after arterial reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Between 1972 and 1988, 48 patients with extremity ischemia after an intraarterial drug injection were treated with the following protocol: heparin, dextran 40, dexamethasone, elevation, and early mobilization of the extremity. A tissue ischemia score, derived by assessing the color, capillary refill, sensory function, and temperature of the extremity, was used to assess the ischemic injury. Each sign was scored either normal = 0 or abnormal = 1; then summed to provide the tissue ischemia score (range, 0 to 4). Twenty-four (50%) patients had an extremity tissue ischemia score less than or equal to 2. After treatment 22 of the 24 patients had a normal extremity, and 2 required limited digital amputations. In this group, outcome was comparable regardless of the time interval from intraarterial drug injection to treatment. Ten of 24 (50%) patients with an extremity tissue ischemia score greater than 2 had a normal extremity, 3 had a functional deficit, and 11 required digital amputations. Twelve of the 24 patients were treated within 24 hours and had a significantly superior outcome when compared to the 12 who were treated more than 24 hours after intraarterial drug injection (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). The tissue ischemia score is a useful predictor of extremity outcome in patients with intraarterial drug injection. The outlined treatment protocol is effective in minimizing tissue injury caused by intraarterial drug injection. Institution of treatment within 24 hours of intraarterial drug injection is particularly important in patients who manifest severe ischemia.",

    "abstract": "The successful follow-up of distal arterial reconstructions for the identification of the failing bypass in the postoperative period hinges on a knowledge of the natural history of flow characteristics in these reconstructions. Over a 4-year period resting and hyperemic bypass flow, fistula flow, conduit diameter, and distal peak systolic velocity of 350 in situ bypasses were measured serially. B-mode ultrasound imaging of the entire bypass was performed to identify specific stenoses. Measurements were performed 5 to 9 days after operation, every 2 months for the first year, and every 6 months thereafter. Distal bypass flow less than 25 ml/min, a ratio of hyperemic/resting distal bypass flow less than 2.5, and vein size less than or equal to 3.0 mm inner diameter all correlated with bypass stenosis (greater than 50%) or occlusion (p less than 0.01). Contrary to previous studies, a distal peak systolic velocity of less than 45 cm/sec did not correlate with bypass stenosis or occlusion. A low distal peak systolic velocity did correlate with bypass stenosis or occlusion in bypasses larger than or equal to 3.5 mm inner diameter (p less than 0.03). However, no combination of these factors was able to accurately predict preocclusive stenosis or occlusion. Distal bypass flow was highest initially but reached a plateau 6 to 12 months after operation. Fistula flow, although very high initially, showed marked decrement with time.",

No patient demonstrated signs or symptoms of an aortovenous fistula before surgery. Emergent surgery prevented extensive preoperative diagnostic testing. The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter. One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported. The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported). Routine use of the cell-saver, oversewing of the fistula from within the aneurysm, and a heightened awareness that this unusual complication is more common in the presence of a very large, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should improve survival.",

    "abstract": "We describe the treatment of a patient with end-stage peripheral vascular disease and ischemic ulceration of the lower extremity in whom an obliteration of the distal arterial bed precluded conventional arterial reconstruction. A nonhealing dorsal foot ulcer was debrided, and soft tissue reconstruction was accomplished by the free microsurgical transfer of a muscle flap to the distal lower extremity. Arterial inflow to this free flap was provided by a contralateral reversed saphenous vein graft from the proximal arterial tree of the leg. This procedure resulted in a healed wound, stable coverage, and limb salvage. The patient also noted complete relief of rest pain and improvement in his claudication symptoms. A follow-up arteriogram was done 2 months after surgery. Contrast injection directly into the artery of this flap showed new blood vessel growth from the muscle flap into the foot with anastomoses of these \"new vessels\" to the patient's native circulation. This experience suggests that limb salvage may be possible by the free microvascular transplantation of a muscle flap onto the limb in selected patients whose limbs are deemed \"nonreconstructible.\"",

Thrombus removed at the time of the left femoral thromboembolectomy grew Histoplasma capsulatum confirming the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. Surgical revascularization of the right leg and parenteral amphotericin B was followed by chronic ketoconazole therapy for 16 months. The patient has remained asymptomatic at 30 months after operation. Effective treatment of endovascular infection with ischemic complications of Histoplasmosis requires surgical revascularization and intensive chemotherapeutic intervention. Histoplasmosis is a ubiquitous infection in endemic areas that often has an asymptomatic subclinical course. Involvement of the cardiovascular system is rarely reported. Previous case reports have described infected cardiac valves and aortic aneurysms. This report describes the uncommon presentation of disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection as a peripheral embolic event and the successful management with revascularization combined with systemic amphotericin B followed by ketoconazole therapy.",

This case report describes congenital absence of the popliteal artery discovered during operative exploration after a traumatic injury to the lower extremity. The preoperative arteriogram suggested acute occlusion of the popliteal artery. Intraoperative exploration and arteriography were consistent with agenesis of the popliteal arterial segment, and postmortem examination confirmed these arteriographic and intraoperative observations. Embryologically, failure of the middle portion of the sciatic artery to persist would account for this anomaly. A review of series reporting congenital anomalies of the lower extremity vasculature failed to discover previous mention of this particular abnormality. Agenesis of the popliteal artery should be included among those vascular anomalies that may affect management of lower extremity vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the fifth reported case of segmental mediolytic arteritis and the second in a survivor. The patient had intraabdominal bleeding as a result of a ruptured omental artery. The pathologic and arteriographic findings are described. The pathology is characterized by segmental disruption of the medial smooth muscle cells and the initiation of mediolysis. Mediolysis is associated with marked segmental thinning of the vessel wall, often with only the adventitia intact. Fibrin is deposited at the adventitial and medial surfaces, and hemorrhage into the media may occur. As in this reported case, lysis of the adventitia leads to sudden, often catastrophic intraabdominal hemorrhage. Little associated adventitial inflammation occurred. Segmental mediolytic arteritis seems to involve the intra-abdominal muscular arteries in elderly patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. An angiogram showed patchy areas of narrowing involving ileal, gastroduodenal, and renal arteries that correlated with the pathologic findings observed in the excised omental arteries.",

    "abstract": "Eight patients with severe pedal ischemia in the presence of palpable foot pulses are described. All had atherosclerosis, and seven patients also had diabetes. There were two anatomic patterns of disease, including supramalleolar obstruction with reconstitution of pulsatile flow in three patients and segmental occlusion of the pedal vessels in five. All patients underwent arterial reconstructive surgery. Patency was sustained in six patients, with limb salvage in five and below-knee amputation in one patient for persistent necrosis and infection of an open amputation. Of the two eventual bypass failures, a transmetatarsal amputation continued to heal in one patient, and the other required amputation below the knee. Palpable pedal pulses and satisfactory ankle/brachial indexes did not rule out the presence of surgically correctable distal arterial occlusive disease. Therefore arteriography is indicated in any patient with persistent forefoot ischemia that fails to respond to conservative measures. The safety and patency of the distal reconstructive procedures performed in this series suggest that salvage of weight-bearing tissue and rapid healing, as well as limb salvage, are legitimate indications for revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Saphenous vein patch rupture after carotid endarterectomy is an infrequent but devastating complication. This study was undertaken to evaluate the material and structural properties of fresh human saphenous veins to understand the causes of this complication. Segments of saphenous veins were obtained from 22 patients from vein harvested during coronary artery bypass surgery. Ninety-three specimens, oriented in both circumferential (n = 45) and longitudinal (n = 48) directions, were prepared from the available vein segments for testing. Specimens were mounted on specially designed grips and then subjected to uniaxial tension testing. For each specimen the following material and structural parameters were determined: vessel diameter, tensile stiffness, failure and ultimate forces, and tensile modulus, failure stress, and strain. The physical properties of specimens evaluated in longitudinal orientations and thus limit the inherent strength of the vein. The physical properties of circumferentially tested vein specimens were negatively correlated to age, female gender, diabetes, and hypertension. The data obtained in this investigation suggest that age, hypertension, as well as diabetes and gender may adversely influence the circumferential tensile strength of human saphenous veins used as patch grafts.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory aneurysms are an uncommon disorder that represent between 5% and 10% of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Their presentation is often variable and may include pain and obstruction of adjacent anatomic structures. This report describes a 68-year-old man who sought treatment after insidious onset of progressive bilateral lower extremity edema over a 6-month period. Noninvasive studies were suggestive of bilateral iliac vein occlusion, and a venogram showed a nearly obstructed vena cava from external compression. A CT scan showed a thick-walled infrarenal abdominal aneurysm. At exploration an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm was found. Because of the presence of dense inflammatory changes surrounding the aneurysm and extending into the pelvis, the surgical procedure of choice was an aortobifemoral bypass graft done with Dacron. The aneurysmal wall was debrided from the vena cava. His postoperative course was uneventful, his edema resolved, and follow-up noninvasive studies were normal. Postoperative venography showed resolution of the extrinsic compression of the vena cava.",

    "abstract": "Because of the theoretic benefits of autologous vein we undertook an investigation to evaluate cervical veins (facial, external jugular) as patch material after carotid endarterectomy. A device that stimulated both circumferential fixation by sutures and radial tension exerted on in vivo patches was constructed to measure burst strength of tissue. Mean bursting pressure for groin saphenous vein (n = 10) was 94.5 +/- 15.1 pounds per square inch (psi), 75.5 +/- 8.9 psi for ankle saphenous vein (n = 10), 83.3 +/- 14.5 psi for everted (double layer) cervical vein (n = 5) and 10 +/- 3.3 psi for single layer cervical vein (n = 5). No significant differences between saphenous vein at any level and everted (double layer) cervical vein, but all were significantly different from single layer cervical vein (p less than 0.05). From June 1987 through November 1989, 19 patients underwent 21 carotid endarterectomies complemented with adjunctive everted cervical vein patch angioplasty. Indications for surgery were asymptomatic stenosis (53%), transient ischemic attack (29%), and cerebrovascular accident with recovery (18%). All patients were studied after surgery with duplex scanning. Asymptomatic recurrent stenosis was observed in one patient. Transient hypoglossal nerve dysfunction occurred in one other patient. One postoperative death occurred as a result of massive aspiration. These results indicate that everted cervical vein is comparable to the saphenous vein in resistance to bursting and can yield similar results as patch material after carotid endarterectomy. Accordingly, saphenous vein can be spared and lower extremity incisions avoided.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The capability of the recently introduced Doppler color-flow mapping devices to accurately detect flow patterns in the region of an arterial stenosis was evaluated by use of an in vitro flow model. Pulsatile flow simulating that in a low-resistance vessel was induced through a straight acrylic tube, which alternatively contained axisymmetric stenoses of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% diameter reduction. Doppler color-flow mapper images were taken in realtime along the tube midplane from 0 to 8 diameters downstream of each stenosis. Comparison of the Doppler color-flow mapping results with similarly recorded flow visualization (hydrogen bubble) images showed a close correspondence of key features of the flow, including detection of a high-velocity, centerline jet and near-wall separated flow zones. Distinctive flow patterns exist with each stenotic case, and these should be of considerable value in diagnosing clinical disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "Rewarming of a cooled rabbit leg was associated with the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals, shown to be instrumental for tissue injury occurring during rewarming. The present study used a compound that, by its ability to bind with free iron, can remove hydroxyl radical (OH.) from tissue. Deferoxamine reduced tissue injury during cooling and rewarming, as evidenced by its ability to decrease tissue release of lactic acid dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Deferoxamine also reduced the formation of OH. and lipid peroxidation during the rewarming phase. This compound did not have any effect on the arterial blood flow pattern, which uniformly decreased during cooling and was restored during rewarming. The results of this study indicate the efficacy of deferoxamine in reducing cellular injury associated with cold and rewarming and further suggest a role for oxygen-derived free radicals in the pathophysiology of cold-rewarming injury.",

    "abstract": "Laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty was performed in 48 arteries (iliac, superficial femoral, and popliteal). Indications for surgery were limb salvage (25%), rest pain (38%), and claudication (38%). Patients were categorized into three groups: lesions less than 5 cm, greater than 5 to 10 cm, or greater than 10 cm in length. Demographic characteristics, risk factors, and outcome measures were compared by use of Fisher's exact test and Student's t test. The time for vascular patency failure was compared by use of a standard Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the three groups. Initial failure to recanalize was noted in 14% in lesions less than 5 cm, 40% in lesions greater than 5 to 10 cm, and 73% in lesions greater than 10 cm. The overall success rate was 38%, with a mean follow up of 1 year. The less than 5 cm lesion group had a significantly higher rate of overall success (59%, p = 0.005) than the other two groups combined. The greater than 10 cm lesion group did significantly worse (9%) than the other two groups combined (p = 0.028). Patients in the less than 5 cm group had significantly longer patency than the other two groups (p less than 0.01). Iliac lesions had a higher overall success rate (73%) than superficial femoral and popliteal artery lesions (35%) (p = 0.038). In conclusion, the widespread application of laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty cannot be justified without further long-term clinical and laboratory investigation. Conversely, the potential of this technique should not be dismissed out of hand. Proper patient selection, length and nature of the lesion to be treated, and the appropriate forms, doses, and method of delivery of laser energy, remain to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Inherited deficiencies of protein S, an inhibitor of the coagulation system, are now recognized as occurring at least twice as frequently as antithrombin III deficiency in patients with venous thrombosis. Protein S is present in plasma in a complexed form, which is inactive, and in a free or functional form. Free protein S combines with activated protein C to inhibit factors V and VIII. This report describes the evaluation of a family with recurrent deep venous thrombosis and superficial thrombophlebitis. Levels of antithrombin III and protein C as well as plasminogen were normal. The levels of total protein S, which includes the value for the free and complexed forms of protein S, were also normal. However, the free protein S levels were greatly reduced in all symptomatic members who were studied. This report illustrates the importance of obtaining measurement of free protein S levels in patients who are suspected of having inherited venous thrombotic disorders.",

    "abstract": "One hundred two patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery were prospectively, randomly allocated to two groups, one of which was monitored with a central venous catheter and the other with a pulmonary artery catheter. Patients with uncompensated cardiopulmonary or renal disease were excluded from the study. General anesthesia was administered for the surgical procedure, and the patients were followed through hospital discharge. No statistically significant differences occurred between the two groups with regard to morbidity (perioperative cardiac, pulmonary or renal sequelae), mortality rate, duration of intensive care, postoperative hospital stay, or cost of hospitalization. The one statistically significant difference between groups was the professional fee charged for anesthetic care, which was higher for patients with pulmonary artery catheters than for those with central venous catheters. In conclusion, we prospectively gathered data from most patients presented for abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery. Our data seem to indicate that the choice of central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter monitoring makes little difference in outcome after abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery, and that for many patients pulmonary artery catheters are not necessary to give appropriate, adequate care. Because of the size of the sample, however, declarations of epidemiologic significance would be unfounded. Therefore large-scale, multicenter studies addressing such outcomes remain necessary.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the flow field within a rigid-walled in vitro model of an end-to-side 45 degree anastomosis in an attempt to identify possible hemodynamic factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of distal anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. A high-resolution photochromic tracer technique was used to visualize the flow in orthogonal planes and to determine the axial wall shear stress profiles for both steady and pulsatile flows over a range of physiologically relevant conditions. The flow field showed qualitative similarities to those seen in curved vessel: rapidly moving fluid from the graft section affects the bed of the host vessel, that is, the wall opposite the anastomosis, eventually advancing down the host vessel in a spiraling motion. A small mobile separation zone was noted at the toe of the anastomosis. Comparison of wall shear stress profiles with previously reported preferential sites for the development of intimal hyperplasia supported a low wall shear stress and/or flow separation pathogenesis hypothesis. One notable exception was the bed of the host artery that appeared to be subjected to a complex hemodynamic environment.",

    "abstract": "Between 1978 and 1988, 215 patients with an average age of 67 years, underwent 246 carotid endarterectomies. Two hundred ten (85.4%) patients were symptomatic, and 36 (14.6%) were asymptomatic. Six patients (2.4%) had a postoperative stroke, and all had immediate reoperation. One of these patients died (30 day mortality rate, 0.4% for the series), and two (0.8%) recovered completely, whereas three (1.2%) had a mild permanent neurologic deficit. Two patients (0.8%) had nonfatal myocardial infarction. Mean follow-up of 42.2 months (range, 1 to 126 months) was achieved. At 5 and 8 years actuarial survival rates of 82% and 66% and stroke-free survival rates of 67% and 37% were observed. Actuarial stroke free rates of 90% at 5 and 8 years were noted. By introducing and observing guidelines that required preoperative study of most clearly defined classes of patients before admission for surgical treatment, the average length of stay for carotid endarterectomy was lowered from 9.5 days in the first 5 years of the study to 5.8 days in the second 5 years (p = 0.001). Average hospital charges, expressed in constant dollars, decreased from $3113 in the first 5 years to $2620 in the second 5 years (p = 0.02) despite an 88% inflationary increase in medical consumer price index. This experience shows that the length of hospitalization of patients with carotid endarterectomy can be reduced and the cost of admission lowered without untoward effect on perioperative morbidity and mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "Five hundred thirty-nine patients with no symptoms of cerebral ischemia undergoing coronary artery bypass were preoperatively evaluated for presence of carotid stenosis by noninvasive methods (duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee). Overall prevalence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% was higher (8.7%) than that generally reported. Age greater than 60 years was significantly related to presence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% (11.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.003). Risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were not predictive for carotid stenosis, postoperative stroke, or death. Carotid stenosis greater than 75% (odds ratio 9.87, p less than 0.005) and coronary artery bypass redo (odds ratio 5.26, p less than 0.05) were both independent predictors of stroke risk. Patients were divided into four groups: group 1, minimal or mild degree of carotid stenosis (less than 50%), not submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (432 patients, 80.1%); group 2, moderate degree of stenosis (50% to 75%), no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (60 patients, 11.2%); group 3, severe carotid stenosis; (greater than 75%), submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (19 patients, 3.5%), group 4, severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (28 patients, 5.2%). Patients in group 4 had significantly higher stroke rate (14.3%) compared to the other three groups (1.1%) (p = 0.0019). The finding of carotid stenosis greater than 75% in patients over 60 years of age was associated with occurrence of stroke in 15% of cases. Carotid screening is helpful to determine patients at increased risk of stroke and should be performed in patients greater than 60 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The indications, morbidity, and efficacy of combined reconstruction of the abdominal aorta and visceral arteries (renal and superior mesenteric; excluding suprarenal aortic aneurysms) were analyzed retrospectively in 29 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from June 1984 through February 1990. Seventeen men and 12 women ages 32 to 76 years (mean, 66 years) were studied. Follow-up was complete in all patients to either death or calendar year 1989 to 1990 (mean, 31.9 months; range, 2 to 66 months). All patients underwent bypass of angiographically proven severe lesions of one renal artery (19 patients), both renal arteries (8 patients), or the superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries (2 patients), in concert with synthetic distal aortic replacement for occlusive disease (10 patients) or aneurysm (19 patients). Indications for renal artery repair included severe hypertension in 13 patients, ischemic renal insufficiency in 8 patients, and lesion morphology alone in 8 patients. Operative mortality rate was 3 of 29 (10.3%), and each death was the result of multisystem organ failure. Nonfatal complications occurred in 11 of the 26 survivors (42%), and this group differed significantly from the uncomplicated 15 patients only in having a higher mean preoperative serum creatinine (2.5 +/- 1.1 mg/dl vs 1.6 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, p = 0.04, t test). The mortality rate of patients with preoperative serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl, was 15.4% (2/13 patients), compared to 6.2% (1/16) in patients with creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl. Three late deaths occurred (2 stroke, 1 cancer). Hypertension control improved in 64% of patients overall, and in 7 of 9 patients whose major operative indication was renovascular hypertension. Renal function remained stable or improved in 12 of 15 patients (80%) with renal insufficiency, but 3 patients progressed to require dialysis. Long-term graft patency was demonstrated by angiography or on duplex scan in all studied survivors (21 patients). Although operative risks are clearly increased compared to less complex vascular procedures, careful patient selection and management will yield a favorable outcome in most patients with such combined lesions.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of infrarenal aortic reconstruction increases when bypass grafts to revascularize associated renal and visceral arteries are needed. Lesions in these vessels, however, are usually limited to their aortic orifices and therefore are amenable to retroperitoneal transaortic endarterectomy. A combined infrarenal aortic reconstruction and transaortic endarterectomy of the renal/visceral vessels was used in 18 (16%) of 120 patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2-year-period. Transaortic endarterectomy was performed primarily for renal preservation in 11 patients with bilateral, high-grade renal artery stenoses and abnormal renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.9 mg/dl). In seven patients transaortic endarterectomy was performed as a secondary procedure during the course of complex reconstruction of aneurysmal or occlusive aortic disease. Mean serum creatinine, which was elevated preoperatively in 14 (78%) patients (3.3 mg/dl), decreased significantly after the operation (2.0 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). A single death occurred in the 18 patients undergoing transaortic endarterectomy. Renal function preservation can be achieved by renal revascularization in patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses and decreased renal function. The retroperitoneal approach to aortic reconstruction and the use of transaortic endarterectomy allows correction of most renal/visceral vessel involvement in complex aortic revascularization procedures.",

    "abstract": "Reports of reconstructive surgery for peripheral vascular disease have been relatively uncommon in patients with end-stage renal disease. Between 1980 and 1989, 39 patients with end-stage renal disease underwent revascularization of 56 limbs. Fifty-two primary infrainguinal and four secondary infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed. In addition, nine thrombectomies were performed. At the time of surgery 37 patients were on dialysis; three had functioning kidney transplants. The indications for revascularization were gangrene, rest pain, or ulceration in all except three limbs with disabling claudication. Reversed, nonreversed, or in situ vein was used in 25 of the 52 primary infrainguinal revascularizations performed. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used in 25. Two procedures used a combination of polytetrafluoroethylene and vein. The primary patencies for all infrainguinal procedures at 1 and 2 years were 77% and 68%, respectively. Four perioperative deaths occurred in the infrainguinal group (7.7%). An additional death occurred after thrombectomy for late graft closure. Three deaths were a result of myocardial infarction. One patient on peritoneal dialysis developed uncontrolled sepsis. At 3 years 39% of patients were alive, and 84% of the limbs were salvaged. Among the cases studied no group was identified that represented unacceptable operative risk. Results compared well with reported patencies for patients subjected to infrainguinal revascularization procedures. Limb revascularization in patients with end-stage renal disease may be performed by use of similar criteria to those used for other patients with peripheral vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the hemodynamics, mechanics, and biologic response of end-to-end versus end-to-side venous anastomoses in a canine arteriovenous graft model. Femoral polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were implanted bilaterally in a paired fashion (n = 22). Detailed local hemodynamic measurements were made by use of color Doppler ultrasound imaging at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implant. Measurements included volumetric flow rate and Doppler-derived spectral window (percent window) as a measure of turbulence. Amplitude and velocity of vessel wall movement were also measured. Volume of perivascular tissue vibration quantitated kinetic energy transfer through the vessel wall. Volumetric flow rate (end to end, 1013 +/- 70 ml/min; end to side, 1015 +/- 72 ml/min), percent window (end to end, 6.6% +/- 0.6%, end to side, 5.6% +/- 0.4%) and volume of perivascular tissue vibration (end to end, 19.6 +/- 1.2 ml, end to side, 16.3 +/- 1.8 ml) were statistically equivalent in the two graft types (end to end vs end to side p greater than 0.05). Both graft types developed venous intimal-medial thickening of a similar magnitude: end to end, 0.35 +/- 0.05 mm, end to side, 0.43 +/- 0.09 mm, normal vein 0.070 +/- 0.004 mm (analysis of variance [ANOVA] p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01 for end to end or end to side vs control, end to end vs end to side p greater than 0.05 by Student-Newman-Keuls test). The best correlations with venous intimal-medial thickening were obtained from inverse percent window (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) and volume of perivascular tissue vibration (r = 0.68, p less than 0.001). In the end to end configuration the relative amplitude of venous wall movement decreased, and the relative velocity of wall motion increased over time. We conclude that in the circumstances of this high flow arteriovenous graft model the end-to-end venous anastomosis does not significantly differ from the end-to-side venous anastomosis in terms of flow stability, turbulence, or kinetic energy transfer. The magnitude of the hyperplastic response is statistically equivalent for the two anastomotic types, but the pattern is somewhat different, possibly providing evidence for differences in stress distribution. Differences in the relative amplitude and velocity of vessel wall movement suggest that anastomotic geometry may affect the way in which kinetic energy is dissipated at the graft/vessel interface.",

    "abstract": "Significant morbidity results from extremity ischemia after acute arterial occlusion. Reestablishment of arterial flow is considered to be the ideal treatment, yet substantial tissue loss can occur before this is accomplished. Using a rat hindlimb model we investigated whether the administration of 100% oxygen would decrease tissue hypoxia from acute arterial occlusion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and Po2 recordings were taken from the gastrocnemius muscle by use of an oxygen electrode. Baseline muscle Po2 was recorded, and then the femoral artery was occluded. Repeat recordings were made after 20 minutes of ventilation with room air and after an additional 20 minutes of ventilation with 100% oxygen (N = 10). Control groups consisted of animals undergoing occlusion but continued on room air (N = 3) and animals undergoing sham occlusion but receiving the period of 100% oxygen ventilation (N = 3). Femoral artery occlusion produced a reduction in muscle Po2 from 28.0 +/- 1.4 to 6.1 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). Ventilation with 100% oxygen reversed the tissue hypoxia produced by occlusion (27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). The administration of 100% oxygen without femoral artery occlusion resulted in a higher tissue Po2 than the occluded + oxygen group (94 +/- 12 vs 27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure increased in the experimental group concomitant with the administration of 100% oxygen, but there was no correlation between final blood pressure and final tissue oxygen tension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of the patients randomized to receive a collagen-coated graft, five showed seroconversion to bovine, type I collagen. Seroconversion also occurred in one of the patients randomized to the noncollagen coated graft. No patient had a positive lymphocyte proliferation response, indicating an absence of cell-mediated immune response. No evidence for the development of cross-reactivity with human collagen was seen.

Two hours of ischemia were followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. In the experimental group iloprost (0.5 microgram/kg/min) was given in a continuous intravenous infusion. Microvascular permeability increased significantly during reperfusion in both control and experimental animals (p less than 0.0001). Treatment with iloprost, however, significantly attenuated this response compared to the control group, 4.8 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.5 microliters/gm/min, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Iloprost decreases the rise in vascular permeability after ischemia and reperfusion. Experimental clinical use of iloprost under controlled conditions in the treatment of patients with acute skeletal muscle ischemia appears justified.",
