    "abstract": "This study attempted to correlate neurologic changes in awake patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under cervical block anesthesia (CBA) with electroencephalography (EEG) and measurement of carotid artery stump pressure (SP).\nContinuous EEG and SP monitoring was measured prospectively in 314 consecutive patients undergoing CEA between April 1, 2003, and July 30, 2006, under CBA. Indications for CEA were asymptomatic 70% to 99% internal carotid artery stenosis in 242 (77.1%), transient ischemic attacks (including transient monocular blindness) in 45 (14.3%), and prior stroke in 27 (8.6%). Mean common carotid artery pressure before clamping, mean SP after carotid clamping, and intraarterial pressure were continuously monitored in all patients. An indwelling shunt was placed when neurologic events (contralateral motor weakness, aphasia, loss of consciousness, or seizures) occurred, regardless of SP or EEG changes.\nShunt placement was necessary because of neurologic changes in 10% (32/314) of all CEAs performed under CBA. Only 3 patients (1.4%) of 216 required shunt placement if SP was 50 mm Hg or more, vs 29 (29.6%) of 98 if SP was less than 50 mm Hg (P < .00001; sensitivity, 29.8%; specificity, 98.6%). In patients with SP of 40 mm Hg or more, 7 (2.6%) of 270 required shunt placement, vs 25 (56.8%) of 44 if SP was less than 40 mm Hg (P < .00001; sensitivity, 56.8%; specificity, 97.4%). Ischemic EEG changes were observed in 19 (59.4%) of 32 patients (false-negative rate, 40.6%) requiring shunt placement under CBA. Three patients had false-positive EEG results and did not require shunt placement (false-positive rate, 1.0%). The perioperative stroke/death rate was 4 (1.2%) in 314. All strokes occurred after surgery and were unrelated to cerebral ischemia or lack of shunt placement.\nTen percent of patients required a shunt placement during CEA under CBA. Shunt placement was necessary in 56.8% of patients with SP less than 40 mm Hg. EEG identified cerebral ischemia in only 59.4% of patients needing shunt placement, with a false-positive rate of 1.0% and a false-negative rate of 40.6%. Both SP and EEG as a guide to shunt placement have poor sensitivity. Intraoperative monitoring of the awake patients under regional anesthesia (CBA) is the most sensitive and specific method to identify patients requiring shunt placement.",

    "abstract": "Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a complex congenital anomaly featuring two or more of the following: (1) capillary malformations (port-wine stains), (2) soft tissue or bony hypertrophy (or both), and (3) varicose veins or venous malformations. With the purpose of determining the actual significance of venous impairment in patients with KTS, we quantified the venous valvular competency and calf muscle pump function and examined their effect on clinical severity.\nIncluded were patients with near-normal function of affected limb(s) and minimal/small foot hypertrophy. Excluded were those with deep venous hypoplasia, aplasia or thrombosis, lymphedema, limb length discrepancy (>2.5 cm), peripheral arterial (ankle-brachial index <1.0), or cardiac disease and walking impairment. Venous duplex scanning, ascending venography, magnetic resonance imaging, strain gauge plethysmography, and a bone scanogram were performed. We studied eight men and seven women aged 15 to 51 years (median, 24 years). The KTS involved 17 limbs (unilateral in 13 patients and bilateral in 2). Contralateral limbs in patients with unilateral KTS acted as controls (n = 13). Venous clinical severity was graded according to the CEAP and venous clinical severity score (VCSS), and reflux complexity was classified according to the venous segmental disease score. Outflow obstruction (outflow fraction at 1 and 4 seconds; OF(1) and OF(4), respectively), reflux (venous filling index), calf muscle pump function (ejection fraction), and hypertension (residual volume fraction) were determined in both limbs with strain gauge plethysmography. Data, reported as median and interquartile range, were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test.\nVaricose veins or venous malformations occurred in the medial, posterior, or anterolateral limb segments of the ankle (7/17, 7/17, and 9/17), calf (10/17, 8/17, and 12/17), knee (9/17, 8/17, and 8/17), and thigh (10/17, 6/17, and 8/17, respectively). Venous malformations occupied the subcutaneous space (17/17) and extended into the subfascial space in 6 (35.3%) of 17 limbs. Abnormal reflux (>0.5 seconds) was distributed in the great (64.7%; 11/17) and small (5.9%; 1/17) saphenous veins and the common femoral (23.5%; 4/17), femoral (41.1%; 7/17), popliteal (29.4%; 5/17), perforator (70.6%; 12/17), and axial calf (35.3%; 6/17) veins. There was no difference in the OF(1) and OF(4) between the affected limbs and the controls. Limbs with KTS had a fivefold greater venous filling index (0.133-0.46 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1); 0.258 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1)) than the controls (0.034-0.055 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1); 0.046 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1); P < .0001), and this was linked to a higher venous segmental disease score (3 [2-4] vs 0 [0-1]; P < .0001). Limbs with KTS had half the ejection fraction (20.8%; 12.3%-24%) of the controls (39.3%; 30.9%-64.6%) and twice as high a residual venous fraction (77% [69.6%-84.5%] vs 40.9% [20.6%-60%]; both P < .004). Patients complained of swelling (100%; 15/15), aching (100%; 15/15), pain (93.3%; 14/15) and heaviness (100%; 15/15), tiredness (66.7%; 10/15), and tightness (33.3%; 5/15) of the limb(s) with KTS. Limbs with KTS had a worse (1) venous clinical severity by 11 VCSS points (11 [8-12] vs 0 [0-1]) and (2) clinical status by 3 CEAP classes (C3 [C3-C4] vs C0 [C0-C2]) than the control limbs (both P < .0001).\nVenous disease in limbs with KTS is a major source of morbidity in affected patients. Limbs with KTS are characterized by complex reflux patterns, severe valvular incompetence, calf muscle pump impairment, and venous hypertension, thus explaining the advanced clinical severity (VCSS) and CEAP grade.",

    "abstract": "We describe and report our results using endoscopic vein harvest (EVH) for lower extremity arterial bypass procedures, following the implementation of technical modifications specific to patients undergoing limb salvage procedures.\nWe underwent training in EVH, followed by implementation of the technique in patients requiring limb salvage for lower extremity ischemia and aneurysms. After technical modifications in the technique were developed for limb salvage, we reviewed our experience in all patients who underwent minimally invasive distal bypass with EVH.\nTechnical modifications include limited arterial dissection before vein harvest, the use of proximal and distal leg incisions for both exposure of arterial vessels and saphenous vein harvest, improved hemostasis techniques in the vein graft tunnel, avoidance of compression wraps to the ipsilateral harvest tunnel, complete removal of the vein with either reversed or nonreversed graft placement, and use of the endoscopic tunnel for conduit placement. Thirteen patients (14 limbs) have undergone minimally invasive distal bypass since technical modifications were implemented. Indications for EVH were rest pain (n = 12; 85.7%) and tissue loss (n = 8; 57.1%). Veins harvested were the ipsilateral great saphenous vein (n = 10; 71.4%), contralateral great saphenous vein (n = 2; 14.3%), and short saphenous vein (n = 2; 14.3%). No venous injuries occurred during endoscopic harvest, and all were used for bypass. Thirty-day primary and primary assisted patency rates were 85.7% and 92.9%, respectively. The limb salvage rate was 100%. Two patients developed postoperative hematomas, one early and one late, as a result of anticoagulation for cardiac comorbidities. Both patients required reoperation for successful re-establishment of patency. There were no perioperative deaths and no postoperative wound infections or complications. Two patients required a later prosthetic bypass, and two required a vein graft angioplasty. Complete wound healing was achieved in 75% of patients with preoperative tissue loss.\nTechnical modifications in endoscopic saphenous vein harvest techniques facilitate their use in lower extremity limb salvage procedures. Vascular surgeons should become familiar with these techniques to minimize vein harvest wound complications and extend the options for limb salvage conduits, including use of both the ipsilateral and contralateral saphenous vein and the short saphenous vein. Meticulous hemostasis within the tunnel after endoscopic conduit harvest and avoidance of postoperative anticoagulation should help to prevent postoperative hematoma formation and early graft occlusion.",

    "abstract": "The best way to manage both symptomatic and asymptomatic severe carotid stenoses has been thoroughly demonstrated by large randomized clinical trials, but less is known about the natural history and management of the contralateral asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA). This prospective study was undertaken to determine whether disease progressed in the contralateral ICA of patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and were followed up clinically and by duplex ultrasound (US) scan.\nThe contralateral asymptomatic ICAs of 599 patients who had undergone CEA for severe carotid disease over a 10-year period were followed up clinically and with duplex US scan at 1 month and then every 6 months. ICA stenosis was classified as mild (30%-49%), moderate (50%-69%), severe (70%-99%), or occlusion. Progression was defined as an increase in ICA stenosis of 50% or more for ICAs with a less than 50% baseline lesion or as an increase to a higher category if the baseline stenosis was 50% or more. End points of the study were the incidence of contralateral disease progression and late neurologic events. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate freedom from disease progression and from neurologic events. The relationship between progression and risk factors was also analyzed.\nOverall, disease progressed in 25.2% of patients (151/599) after a mean follow-up of 4.1 years. Disease progressed in 34.3% of patients (101/294) with mild stenosis vs 47.9% of patients with moderate stenosis (47/98; P = .016). Three additional patients with mild lesions at baseline progressed to severe lesions. The median time to progression was 29.8 months for mild and 18.5 months for moderate stenoses (P = .033). The rate of late neurologic events referable to the contralateral ICA was 3.2% (19/599) for the entire series and 4.8% (19/392) for patients with a 30% or greater ICA stenosis: these included 4 (0.7%) strokes and 15 (2.5%) transient ischemic attacks. All but 3 events (16.3%; 16/98) occurred in patients with disease progression from moderate to severe stenosis. Overall, 53 late CEAs were performed.\nThis prospective analysis has shown that disease progression in contralateral asymptomatic ICAs after CEA is relatively common in patients with a diseased ICA at the baseline and strongly supports duplex US surveillance, approximately every 6 months, in patients with more than mild disease. A baseline lesion is significantly predictive of progression to severe stenosis, and progression from moderate to severe stenosis is strongly associated with neurologic clinical events. No demographic or clinical factor proved useful in identifying patients likely to experience disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Correlation of carotid duplex ultrasound (DUS) flow velocities with carotid artery stenosis before and after carotid endarterectomy is well established. With the evolution of catheter-based techniques, carotid stenosis increasingly is being treated with angioplasty and stenting (CAS). CAS changes the physical properties of the arterial wall, which may alter blood flow velocities compared with the nonstented carotid. Opinions differ about whether DUS is a reliable tool to assess technical outcome and recurrent stenosis after CAS. This study correlated carotid DUS flow velocity findings with carotid arteriography after CAS.\nData from 77 pairs of carotid arteriograms with corresponding DUS after CAS in 68 patients were reviewed. Preintervention and postintervention DUS and carotid arteriogram data were evaluated for each patient. Peak systolic velocities (PSV), end-diastolic velocities (EDV), and internal carotid artery/common carotid artery ratios (ICA/CCA) were correlated with the post-CAS arteriogram.\nThe mean preintervention PSV was 390 +/- 110 cm/s (range, 216 to 691 cm/s), and the average EDV was 134 +/- 51 cm/s (range, 35 to 314 cm/s). Postintervention DUS was obtained a mean of 5 days after CAS (range, 1 to 30 days). Sixty (81%) post-CAS arteriograms were normal, and each corresponded to a normal postintervention DUS (PSV range, 30 to 118 cm/s; EDV range, 18 to 60 cm/s). In 14 arteries (19%), completion arteriograms revealed residual stenoses of 20% to 40% in 13, and 50% in one. The mean PSV was 175 cm/s (range, 137 to 195 cm/s), and the mean EDV was 44 cm/s (range, 20 to 62 cm/s). All velocities exceeded the threshold of a 50% stenosis by DUS criteria for a nonstented carotid artery. In three arteries (2 patients), high-grade recurrent stenoses detected by DUS developed that required reintervention during follow-up. This high-grade restenosis was confirmed by arteriography in each patient, providing an additional three correlations.\nNormal DUS imaging reliably identifies arteriographically normal carotid arteries after CAS. Carotid velocities are disproportionately elevated with mild and moderate degrees of stenoses, and velocity criteria for quantitating stenoses in these patients require modification. However, DUS appropriately identifies severe recurrent stenoses after CAS.",

    "abstract": "To determine the prevalence of uncommon ulcers, unrelated to venous or arterial etiology, in patients presenting to vascular clinics.\nThis was a multicenter prospective study of consecutive patients presenting with lower extremity ulceration. The settings were university hospital outpatient centers and venous clinics. A total of 799 limbs in 710 patients with leg ulcers were evaluated. Patients with venous ulcer disease and with evidence of arterial disease with an ankle-brachial index less than 0.7 were excluded from the study. Out of 710 patients, 17 patients with a total of 21 limbs fit the criteria for inclusion. All limbs included in this study underwent physical examination, ankle-brachial index measurements, duplex ultrasonography, and skin biopsies.\nThe mean age of patients with uncommon ulcers was 65.6 years, and the mean duration was 5.5 years. A total of 2.1% of all leg ulcers seen were due to uncommon etiology unrelated to venous or arterial pathology. Most of these ulcers were located in the medial lower calf (n = 19). In six patients with ulcers, the histology did not reveal any specific cause; five had a neoplasia, three had chronic inflammation, two had sickle cell disease, two had vasculitis, one had rheumatoid arthritis, one had pyoderma gangrenosum, and one had ulcer due to hydroxyurea.\nThe prevalence of leg ulcers unrelated to arterial and venous disease that presented with signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease was 2.1%. Their etiology is variable, most often including vasculitis, neoplasia, metabolic disorders, infection, and other rare causes. Early identification of uncommon ulcers may facilitate timely and appropriate management.",

Given the competing interest in endovascular procedures, the results of bypass surgery must be assessed as precisely as possible for future comparison. In this study, the original meta-analysis was refined and updated by increasing the number of studies reviewed, estimating primary graft patency, extending follow-up time, and investigating the problem of early amputation despite a patent graft.\nStudies published from 1987 through 2005 were identified from two electronic databases. Two investigators independently extracted the survival data from life tables, survival curves, and texts. Pooled survival curves were then constructed for graft patency, limb salvage, and patient survival according to a random-effects protocol for meta-analysis.\nOf 28 articles included, 18 reported amputation despite a patent graft in 84 (10%) out of 844 limbs, and 25 described a perioperative mortality of 88 (8.8%) out of 996 patients. The 5-year pooled estimate (SE) was 50.4% (15.4%) for primary patency, 50.8% (19.0%) for secondary patency, 66.6% (11.2%) for limb salvage, and 23.0% (11.7%) for patient survival. No publication bias was detected.\nLimb salvage can be achieved in most end-stage renal disease patients who undergo bypass surgery for critical ischemia, but survival is poor. To avoid early amputation despite a patent graft, bypass grafting should not be offered to patients with a great amount of tissue loss or extensive infection.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to demonstrate improved survival (30-day mortality) after the introduction of an emergency endovascular therapy protocol for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). Numerous authors have successfully demonstrated reduced mortality in patients with rAAA using endovascular techniques. Comparison of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with open repair for rAAA may be misleading, however, because EVAR cannot be performed on all patients, and selection bias may explain the superior performance of any given surgical or endovascular strategy. We developed a model to predict mortality in patients before the introduction of EVAR (preprotocol population), applied this model to predict 30-day mortality among prospective patients (postprotocol population), and compared observed vs expected results.\nWe assessed 126 patients with rAAA. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Potential confounding variables were age, sex, presurgical lowest recorded systolic blood pressure (SBP), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A logistic regression model incorporating significant confounders was used to evaluate changes in 30-day mortality for all patients with rAAA after introduction of the EVAR protocol. Separate logistic regressions were done to compare 30-day mortality for preprotocol vs patients receiving EVAR and preprotocol vs patients receiving postprotocol open repair. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis was used to assess shifts in the performance of the rAAA program over time.\nSignificant confounders were SBP, absence of SBP, and GFR. Logistic regression found evidence of lower mortality after the protocol was introduced, 17.9% vs 30.0% (odds ratio [OR], 0.385; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.141 to 0.981; P = .046). Comparison of all open repairs (preprotocol and postprotocol) and EVAR demonstrated decreased risk for EVAR of 5.0% vs 28.3% (OR, 0.109; 95% CI, 0.013 to 0.906; P = .0084). Unstable patients (SBP <or=80) showed a trend towards improved survival with EVAR relative to open repair (14.3% vs 56.0%, P = .061). Comparison of preprotocol surgery with open repair after the introduction of the protocol found no evidence of a difference between mortality rates for the open procedures-30.0% (preprotocol) vs 25.0% (postprotocol; OR, 0.688; 95% CI, 0.335 to 1.415, P = .3031)-demonstrating that the improved performance observed with CUSUM analysis was related to the introduction of the EVAR protocol.\nOur predictive model using \"weighted\" CUSUM analysis (a measure of performance over time) demonstrated that a predefined strategy of management of rAAA that includes EVAR is associated with improved (P < .05) mortality. Unstable patients with rAAA may be particularly benefited by EVAR and should not be excluded from repair. Appropriate patients with rAAA who are undergoing treatment in experienced vascular centers should be offered EVAR as the treatment of choice.",

    "abstract": "The study assessed the effect on postoperative renal function of left renal vein (LRV) division and reconstruction by direct reanastomosis or graft interposition during infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nBetween January 2001 and March 2006, 1189 patients underwent elective open repair of infrarenal AAAs. LRV division was performed in 15 (1.3%) and its reconstruction in all but one (LRV group), where the LRV was occluded. Patients' glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were retrospectively estimated through postoperative day 4 by using the Cockcroft-Gault equation and compared with the GFRs of 56 controls undergoing AAA repair without LRV division (control group) randomly identified from a prospectively compiled database in a 4:1 ratio. Post hoc 1:1 case-matched analysis was also performed. Statistical analyses were performed as appropriate.\nComparison of demographics and risk factors revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups with the exception of the following: AAAs were larger in LRV group (71.4 +/- 17.1 mm vs 56.0 +/- 14.6 mm; P = .003) and preoperative GFR was lower in LRV group (65.3 +/- 19.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 82.8 +/- 22.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .009). Postoperatively, the trend of GFR with time did not differ between groups (P = .33). The variation of GFR at day 4 after surgery compared with preoperative values was not different either (5.6 +/- 12.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 1.0 +/- 15.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .67). A further 1:1 case-matched multivariate analysis of variance, matching patients and controls by AAA size and preoperative GFR, showed no difference in trend of GFR with time between groups (P = .15). Operative time was not significantly longer in LRV group (148.4 +/- 35.8 minutes vs 131.0 +/- 40.3 minutes; P = .07). No differences between groups were found for blood loss (585.7 +/- 264.2 mL vs 567.7 +/- 222.5 mL; P = .88), perioperative complications (5 vs 8; P = .12), or hospital length of stay (6.2 +/- 1.8 days vs 5.5 +/- 1.2 days; P = .10). A 6-month follow-up of renal function available in 12 patients of LRV group showed no significant decrease in GFR compared with postoperative values (70.8 +/- 24.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 69.1 +/- 23.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .86). At duplex scan, the reconstructed LRV could be insonated in nine of these 12 patients and all were patent.\nLRV division during AAA repair was associated with larger aneurysms and preoperative subclinical renal function impairment. In these patients, LRV reconstruction was associated with the maintenance of preoperative renal functional status without significantly lengthening of operative time or increasing the complications from surgery.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of simvastatin pretreatment in the setting of acute limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in an experimental diabetes model that is associated with a high risk for limb loss.\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into two groups. Diabetes was induced in the first group by intravenous streptozotocin injection. The second group served as the nondiabetic group. Eight weeks after the streptozotocin injection, half of the rats in the diabetic and the nondiabetic groups were further randomized to receive either intraperitoneal simvastatin (1 mg/kg per day) or saline treatment for 6 weeks. Bilateral hind-limb ischemia was induced for 4 hours by the tourniquet method. After 24 hours of reperfusion, tissue samples were collected from the gastrocnemius and anterior tibial muscles bilaterally for measurement of muscle edema, percentage of necrosis, and malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels.\nIschemic injury was more prominent in diabetic animals. The diabetic animals with limb ischemia exhibited a 7% increase in tissue edema, a 47% increase in muscle necrosis and MPO level, and a 15% reduction in glutathione levels compared with the nondiabetic animals (P < .05). Simvastatin treatment with 1 mg/kg for 6 weeks reduced the ischemic injury. Simvastatin pretreatment led to a 71% reduction in muscle necrosis in diabetic animals (P < .001). The protective effects of simvastatin pretreatment also correlated with a 23% improvement in tissue edema, a 75% reduction in tissue myeloperoxidase content, and a 71% increase in glutathione levels in diabetic animals (P < .01). Furthermore, skeletal muscle injury, characterized by tissue edema and leucosequestration, was significantly less severe with simvastatin pretreatment compared with the nondiabetic animals (P < .01).\nSimvastatin pretreatment reduced limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic and nondiabetic animals. We conclude that simvastatin pretreatment may be a potential therapeutic intervention for skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury in the clinical setting.",

Coverage of the left subclavian origin has been reported to expand the proximal sealing zone. We report the planned coverage of the celiac artery origin with a thoracic stent graft to achieve an adequate distal sealing zone.\nAll patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair are prospectively entered into a computerized database. All patients who underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair with coverage of the celiac artery origin were identified and retrospectively analyzed. End points for evaluation included indications for covering the celiac artery, anatomic features of the distal landing zone, demonstration of collateral circulation between the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery, technical success of the procedure, and presence of clinical ischemic symptoms after the procedure.\nBetween March 2005 and May 2006, 46 patients underwent endovascular repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. Seven patients had planned celiac artery coverage with a thoracic stent graft to secure an adequate distal sealing zone. Six patients demonstrated collateral circulation through the gastroduodenal artery between the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries before deployment of the stent graft. One patient had a distal type I endoleak at the conclusion of the procedure related to inadequate sealing at the superior mesenteric artery origin. No type II endoleaks were evident at the final intraoperative angiogram or 30-day computed tomography scan. There were no postoperative deaths, no ischemic abdominal complications, and no clinical spinal cord ischemia. Short-term follow-up (1 to 10 months) has demonstrated no additional endoleaks (type I not fully assessed), no aneurysm growth, and no aneurysm ruptures.\nThis limited series supports the suitability, in selected patients, of covering the celiac artery origin for a distal landing zone when the distal sealing zone proximal to the celiac artery is inadequate.

Routine patient follow-up included computed tomography scans and abdominal plain films at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery and yearly thereafter. Although patients were specifically instructed not to undergo MRI, retrospective review identified 22 patients (4%) who underwent MRI after stent-graft implantation.\nSeventeen of 22 patients consented to have their records reviewed as part of this study and underwent MRI at a mean interval of 669 days (range, 3-2179 days) after stent-graft implantation. Eleven patients underwent implantation of Zenith bifurcated stent grafts, and six had custom-made uni-iliac stent grafts. These patients underwent a total of 20 MRI studies-10 of the brain/neck and 10 of the abdomen, pelvis, or spine. In all cases, the magnetic field strength was 1.5 T or less. No patient experienced any symptoms of abdominal or back pain during or after the MRI. Comparison of the pre- and post-MRI computed tomography scans (available in 15 of 17 patients) and abdominal radiographs showed no change in stent-graft structure, position, or function in any of these patients and no increase in abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter in any patient at an average of 899 days after MRI.\nOn the basis of this limited experience, MRI has no discernible effect on the structure, position, or function of stainless-steel Z-stent-based abdominal aortic prostheses.",

    "abstract": "This report analyzes the safety and efficacy of carbon dioxide digital subtraction angiography (CO(2)-DSA) for EVAR in a group of patients with renal insufficiency compared with a concurrent group of patients with normal renal function undergoing EVAR with iodinated contrast angiography (ICA).\nBetween 2003 and 2005, 100 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR using ICA, CO(2)-DSA, or both were retrospectively reviewed, and preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, and follow-up variables were collected. Patients were divided into two groups depending on renal function and contrast used. Group I comprised patients with normal renal function in whom ICA was used exclusively, and group II patients had a serum creatinine >or=1.5 mg/dL, and CO(2)-DSA was used preferentially and supplemented with ICA, when necessary. The two groups were compared for the outcomes of successful graft placement, renal function, endoleak type, and frequency, and the need for graft revision. Comparisons were made using chi(2) analysis, Student t test, and the Fisher exact test.\nA total of 84 EVARs were performed in group I and 16 in group II. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between groups with the exception of serum creatinine, which was significantly increased in group II (1.8 mg/dL vs 1.0 mg/dL P < .0005). All 100 endografts were successfully implanted. Patients in group II had longer fluoroscopy times, longer operative times, and increased radiation exposure, and 13 of 16 patients required supplemental ICA. Mean iodinated contrast use was 27 mL for group II vs 148 mL in group I (P < .0005). Mean postoperative serum creatinine was unchanged from baseline, and 30-day morbidity was similar for both groups. No patient required dialysis. No patients died. Perioperatively, and at 1 and 6 months, the endoleak type and incidence and need for endograft revision was no different between groups.\nCO(2)-DSA is safe, can be used to guide EVAR, and provides outcomes similar to ICA-guided EVAR. CO2-DSA protects renal function in the azotemic patient by lessening the need for iodinated contrast and associated nephrotoxicity, but with the tradeoff of longer fluoroscopy and operating room times and increased radiation exposure.",

    "abstract": "Infected femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (IFAP) is a severe complication in parenteral drug abusers, with difficult and controversial management. Ligation alone without revascularization is frequently associated with later intermittent claudication and limb amputation. Furthermore, arterial reconstruction with a synthetic or venous conduit is limited because of a contaminated field and, often, unavailability of autologous venous grafts. In this study, we present our experience with the internal iliac artery (IIA) as a graft for arterial reconstruction after IFAP excision in these patients.\nData of 14 consecutive patients who presented with IFAP secondary to parenteral drug abuse from 2001 to 2005 were analyzed. Twelve patients (85.7%) were male. The median age was 27 years (range, 19-42 years). In 13 cases, the IFAP involved the common femoral artery, and in 1 case it involved the profunda femoris artery (PFA). In nine patients, we used the IIA for arterial reconstruction (five as a patch and four as an interposition graft), whereas in two patients the arterial deficit was repaired with a great saphenous vein patch. In two cases, an extra-anatomic bypass with a synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene graft was performed. In one patient, the pseudoaneurysm involved the PFA and was treated with excision and ligation of the PFA.\nAll nine patients who underwent revascularization with the use of IIA were free of claudication symptoms. None of them experienced any perioperative complications, had signs of reinfection, or required limb amputation during the follow-up period (median, 19 months; range, 4-52 months). Regarding the remaining five patients, one died 25 days after surgery because of multiorgan failure, and one underwent reoperation because of proximal anastomotic rupture of a synthetic graft. The latter patient finally underwent a transmetatarsal amputation.\nThe use of IIA for arterial reconstruction after IFAP excision in drug abusers is safe and effective. These preliminary results indicate that the implementation of this technique offers many advantages compared with traditional treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Endograft repair holds considerable promise in the treatment of traumatic disruption of the thoracic aorta because patients often have multiple coexisting injuries further complicating traditional open repair. In addition, patients are often young, with an aortic anatomy dissimilar to those with atherosclerotic aneurysms. As a result, techniques for endograft repair have to be refined accordingly.\nThe records of 20 consecutive cases of traumatic aortic disruption treated by endograft repair at a single institution were reviewed.\nMean patient age was 40 years (range, 17 to 88 years), and 17 (85%) of 20 patients were men. All cases were completed. There were no procedure related deaths, but four (20%) patients died of their co-injuries. Only two (10%) of 20 required a graft >28 mm in diameter, and nine (45%) aortas were small enough to require use of 23-mm abdominal cuffs. Six (30%) of 20 cases required complete or partial coverage of the left subclavian artery. Placement of a proximal extension was required in one patient for a type I endoleak. A graft collapse occurred in one patient that required surgical removal and aortic repair.\nEndovascular repair of traumatic aortic disruption can be accomplished in most cases. Compared with atherosclerotic aneurysms, the proximal thoracic aorta tends to be smaller and the arch angle tighter in an aorta 19mm in diameter. This frequently necessitates the use of smaller devices and less stiff wires. Surgeons should be prepared to cover the left subclavian artery if needed, have a wide range of device sizes in stock to avoid over-sizing, and show restraint if the anatomy appears unsuitable.",

    "abstract": "Injuries to the abdominal aorta are rare and remain one of the most lethal causes of early death in trauma. The purposes of this study were to identify primary predictors of mortality and to examine the impact of a well-established operating room resuscitation protocol on survival in patients with traumatic aortic injury.\nA 20-year retrospective review was performed of medical records and autopsy reports of trauma patients admitted with confirmed injury to the abdominal aorta. Data on patient demographics, admission characteristics, operative findings, and the initial location of resuscitation were collected. The main outcome measure was death.\nAbdominal aortic injuries were diagnosed in 60 patients. Their average age was 26.5 years, and the mean transport time was 10 minutes. The overall mortality rate (MR) was 73%. With the exclusion of 18 patients considered dead on arrival, the MR decreased to 61%. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 20% (MR 92%) and penetrating in 80% (MR 68%). Acidosis, defined as a pH <7.2 (MR 81%) or a base deficit >10 (MR 77%), was a predictor of death (P < .0001). Patients resuscitated directly in the operating room had a significantly lower MR (40%) than those resuscitated in the trauma room (MR 78%; P < .02). The lack of retroperitoneal tamponade (P < .02), the presence of associated intra-abdominal injuries (P < .001), and the location of aortic injury at the subdiaphragmatic (18%; MR 90%) or suprarenal location (37%; MR 71%; P < .005) at exploration resulted in significantly higher patient mortality. Surgical management consisted of primary repair in 26, end-to-end repair in 1, interposition graft in 8, or patch in 1. Resuscitative thoracotomy was performed in 27 patients (45%), with an overall MR of 92%.\nDespite advances in fluid resuscitation, operative strategy, and transport during the past 20 years, the mortality of traumatic injury to the abdominal aorta remains high. Shock, acidosis, suprarenal aortic injury, and a lack of retroperitoneal tamponade all independently contribute to mortality and should raise the suspicion for a potentially lethal aortic injury in a severely injured patient. Rapid identification and resuscitation in the operating room may therefore be the only factors to improve current survival rates in such devastating injuries.",

Follow-up included routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography and multiview abdominal radiographs at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Data on late-occurring (>30 days after stent-graft implantation) complications and interventions were collected prospectively.\nOf the original 325 patients, 92 have since died, resulting in a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 1 month to 7.0 years). Nine (2.8%) of 325 patients required reintervention to treat or prevent endoleak (type I or III) or graft occlusion at an average of 1.4 years after stent-graft placement (range, 40 days to 4.0 years). Three (0.9%) of these patients died from causes related to malfunction of the stent graft: one each from aneurysm rupture, stent-graft infection, and infection of a femoral-femoral bypass graft placed after limb occlusion. Nineteen additional patients (5.8%) required treatment for type II endoleak, for a total reintervention rate of 8.6%.\nLate failures of Zenith stent-graft attachment, structure, or function are rare.

    "abstract": "The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the infrapopliteal arterial segment is not well defined. This study evaluated the clinical utility and diagnostic accuracy of time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) MRA compared with digital subtraction contrast angiography (DSA) in planning for percutaneous interventions of popliteal and infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease.\nPatients who underwent percutaneous lower extremity interventions for popliteal or tibial occlusive disease were identified for this study. Preprocedural TRICKS MRA was performed with 1.5 Tesla (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wis) magnetic resonance imaging scanners with a flexible peripheral vascular coil, using the TRICKS technique with gadodiamide injection. DSA was performed using standard techniques in angiography suite with a 15-inch image intensifier. DSA was considered the gold standard. The MRA and DSA were then evaluated in a blinded fashion by a radiologist and a vascular surgeon. The popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk were evaluated separately, and the tibial arteries were divided into proximal, mid, and distal segments. Each segment was interpreted as normal (0% to 49% stenosis), stenotic (50% to 99% stenosis), or occluded (100%). Lesion morphology was classified according to the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC). We calculated concordance between the imaging studies and the sensitivity and specificity of MRA. The clinical utility of MRA was also assessed in terms of identifying arterial access site as well as predicting technical success of the percutaneous treatment.\nComparisons were done on 150 arterial segments in 30 limbs of 27 patients. When evaluated by TASC classification, TRICKS MRA correlated with DSA in 83% of the popliteal and in 88% of the infrapopliteal segments. MRA correctly identified significant disease of the popliteal artery with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 92%, and of the tibial arteries with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 84%. When used to evaluate for stenosis vs occlusion, MRA interpretation agreed with DSA 90% of the time. Disagreement occurred in 15 arterial segments, most commonly in distal tibioperoneal arteries. MRA misdiagnosed occlusion for stenosis in 11 of 15 segments, and stenosis for occlusion in four of 15 segments. Arterial access was accurately planned based on preprocedural MRA findings in 29 of 30 patients. MRA predicted technical success 83% of the time. Five technical failures were due to inability to cross arterial occlusions, all accurately identified by MRA.\nTRICKS MRA is an accurate method of evaluating patients for popliteal and infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease and can be used for planning percutaneous interventions.",

MRA correctly identified significant disease of the popliteal artery with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 92%, and of the tibial arteries with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 84%. When used to evaluate for stenosis vs occlusion, MRA interpretation agreed with DSA 90% of the time. Disagreement occurred in 15 arterial segments, most commonly in distal tibioperoneal arteries. MRA misdiagnosed occlusion for stenosis in 11 of 15 segments, and stenosis for occlusion in four of 15 segments. Arterial access was accurately planned based on preprocedural MRA findings in 29 of 30 patients. MRA predicted technical success 83% of the time. Five technical failures were due to inability to cross arterial occlusions, all accurately identified by MRA.",

    "abstract": "Free-floating thrombus (FFT) of the carotid artery is an uncommon entity that usually presents as an acute emergency. Management is based on case reports and series because the natural history and optimal treatment are unknown. This study was conducted to systematically review the world literature in an attempt to better understand FFT, its presentation, distribution, management, and outcome.\nA literature search in all languages was performed of the PubMed database (> or =1950s) and Medline database (1966-November 2004). All relevant articles were reviewed and their references analyzed in a similar manner for further literature. Cases from the authors' institutions were reviewed as well. All cases within the reports were individually assessed for inclusion or exclusion. Inclusion required that the FFT originate or anchor within the carotid artery (ie, excluding emboli, arch thrombi with extensions into the carotid artery), be partially occluding (ie, excluding occlusions, \"string-sign,\" microscopic thrombus), and ideally have an elongated or protrusive morphology, circumferential flow around the distal portion, and cyclical motion with the cardiac cycles.\nThere were 61 reports reviewed, of which 43 contained FFT cases. These reports had 342 cases (including the current series) that were reviewed, of which 145 met our inclusion criteria. A database was created for qualitative and quantitative assessment of all cases. When data were pooled, appropriate statistical analysis was performed. A limitation of the study is that FFT is under-reported and ill defined, which limited the analysis in quantity and quality. In addition, reporting is not uniform, and therefore, significant data were not always present. In attempting to define FFT and include or exclude cases, subjectivity is inherent.\nFFT is more frequently reported in men than women, with a ratio of nearly 2:1 (P < .0001), and at a younger age than in most patients with carotid disease (P < .0001 when compared with North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, European Carotid Surgery Trial, and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial). Symptoms are present in 92% of patients. There was a trend for patients with FFT to be hypercoagulable (47% of those serologically tested). The internal carotid artery was the most commonly affected (75%), with atherosclerosis being the most common associated pathology. Medical and surgical management have both been used, with neither clearly superior to the other. Medical management for stabilizing neurologic deficits has less risk and less benefit than surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with advanced age, male gender, cigarette smoking, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and genetic predisposition. Basic research studies have led to a better understanding of aneurysm disease over the past two decades. There has also been a growing appreciation that fundamental knowledge regarding the process of aneurysmal degeneration is still somewhat limited. Opportunities in research include: 1) the investigation of potential new mechanism-based pharmacologic interventions; 2) identify the genetic basis for an inherited predisposition; 3) develop and refine noninvasive approaches for the early detection; 4) examine potential novel surgical approaches and design new biomaterials; and 5) initiate and promote awareness programs for diagnosis and treatment of aortic aneurysms. The optimal approach to addressing these issues will require integrative, multidisciplinary research programs that involve basic scientists working in concert with vascular and cardiothoracic surgeons, as well as other clinical specialists with expertise in vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in the blood vessel wall response to hemodynamic forces. We hypothesized that TNF-alpha activity drives neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) during vein graft arterialization and that anti-TNF-alpha therapy would inhibit NIH.\nRabbits underwent bilateral vein grafting using jugular vein. All distal branches except the occipital artery were unilaterally ligated to create distinct flow environments between the bilateral grafts. Vein grafts were harvested sequentially up to 28 days for TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) quantitation. In separate experiments, animals received short-term or long-term dosing with pegylated soluble TNF-alpha type I receptor (PEG sTNF-RI) or vehicle. After 14 to 28 days, grafts were analyzed for morphometry, proliferation, apoptosis, and PEG sTNF-RI distribution.\nQuantitative mRNA assay (TaqMan) revealed shear-dependent (P < .001) and time-dependent (P < .001) TNF-alpha expression. TNF-alpha induction was maximal at day 1 and gradually decreased over time, but was persistently elevated even 4 weeks later (P < .001). Low shear (associated with increased NIH) resulted in significantly higher TNF-alpha mRNA expression (P = .03). PEG sTNF-RI was found in high concentrations in the serum and localized to NIH. The high-flow and low-flow vein grafts from treated animals demonstrated similar volumes of NIH compared with controls. PEG-sTNF-RI had only modest impact on vascular wall cell turnover, as reflected by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxy uridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (P = .064) and anti-Ki-67 (P = .12) assays.\nPlacement of a vein into the arterial circulation acutely upregulates TNF-alpha; this expression level correlates with the degree of subsequent NIH. Pharmacologic interruption of this signaling pathway has no significant impact on NIH or wall cellular proliferation/apoptosis, suggesting that early vein graft adaptations can proceed via TNF-alpha-independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are early and crucial events in the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia, the primary cause of restenosis after vascular intervention. We tested the hypothesis that protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta), a ubiquitously expressed intracellular protein kinase, regulates vascular SMC proliferation and migration.\nExogenous PKCdelta was expressed in cultured SMCs via stable transfection or adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Conversely, endogenous PKCdelta was inhibited by means of targeted gene deletion (gene knock-out). Cell proliferation and migration were determined by (3)H-thymidine incorporation and 24-well transwell assay, respectively.\nWe isolated and examined three A10 SMC lines in which PKCdelta was stably transfected. Compared with cells that were transfected with an empty vector, cells transfected with PKCdelta exhibited reduced ability to proliferate. Moreover, PKCdelta transfection inhibited SMC migration toward platelet-derived growth factor-BB. Similar inhibitory effects on proliferation and migration were also observed when PKCdelta was introduced into primary aortic SMCs via an adenoviral vector. Interestingly, SMCs isolated from PKCdelta knockout mice also displayed decreased chemotaxis and proliferation compared with PKCdelta(+/+) littermates, suggesting a complex yet critical role for PKCdelta. We studied the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 as a possible signaling pathway for PKCdelta's inhibitory effect. PKCdelta overexpression diminished ERK1/2 activity. Molecular restoration of ERK activation reversed the inhibitory effect of PKCdelta on SMC proliferation and migration.\nWe demonstrate that although normal migration and proliferation is lessened in SMCs deficient in PKCdelta, its prolonged activation also diminishes those behaviors. This suggests a dual, critical role for PKCdelta in SMC proliferation and migration, and thus intimal hyperplasia and restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Instability and rupture of carotid atherosclerotic plaques leads to thromboemboli and ischemic symptoms. Angiogenesis occurs within atherosclerotic plaques, and plaque vulnerability and symptomatic carotid disease have been associated with increased numbers of microvessels. In addition to microvessel number, it is possible that the phenotypes of intraplaque vessels could influence plaque stability. To test this, the morphology and maturity of vessels within plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was determined.\nCarotid plaques were collected after endarterectomy from a cohort of 13 asymptomatic patients and 30 symptomatic patients. Plaques were sectioned and immunostained for the presence of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Sections were assessed for microvessel morphology, maturity as judged by smooth muscle cell cover, and the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor and macrophages.\nTwo types of vascular structure were observed within plaques, microvessels and dilated, highly irregular multilobular vessels. These irregular dysmorphic vessels were found almost exclusively in plaques from symptomatic patients. The dysmorphic vessels lacked smooth muscle cells and were highly immature. Plaques also contained vascular endothelial growth factor, and this was observed adjacent to the dysmorphic vessels. This growth factor was found colocalized with macrophages.\nSymptomatic carotid plaques contain abnormal, immature microvessels similar to those found in tumors and healing wounds. Such vessels could contribute to plaque instability by acting as sites of vascular leakage by inflammatory cell recruitment. The immature vessels within plaques may be therapeutic targets for promoting plaque stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular procedure simulators are now commercially available and in use for physician training. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of simulation-based training in vascular surgery residencies.\nResidents from vascular surgery programs in a five-state area were invited to participate in a series of 2-day endovascular training programs that used a high-fidelity endovascular procedure simulator (SimSuite; Medical Simulation Corporation, Denver, Colo), didactic instruction, computer-based training, and tabletop procedure demonstrations. The curriculum covered arteriography and intervention for treatment of aortoiliac, renal, and carotid artery disease. Nine residents participated, with one to three per training session. Each completed an average of 9.5 simulated endovascular cases. Performance on a standardized TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus B iliac angioplasty/stenting case was used to assess endovascular skills and knowledge at the beginning of the training program, and this was repeated at the completion of the training. Performance metrics were measured by the simulator, faculty observed trainees' performance of simulated cases, and trainees provided their evaluations of the usefulness of the simulation experiences.\nEndovascular procedural skills on the standardized iliac intervention case improved after completion of the training program. Compared with performance early on day 1, performance improved (P < or = .05; paired t test): total procedure time decreased 54%, volume of contrast decreased 44%, and fluoroscopy time decreased 48% (mean change from baseline). Selection of angioplasty balloon catheters and stents was improved, and the average number of catheters used and stents deployed decreased, although this did not reach statistical significance. Faculty observation allowed identification of shortcomings of knowledge and skills, including common problems with selection of catheter, balloon, and stent sizes; correct positioning of the sheath; and intraprocedural monitoring. Postcourse evaluations indicated support for the use of simulation in vascular surgery residents' endovascular training.\nTraining with a simulator, incorporated into an individual or small group learning session, offers a means to learn and realistically practice endovascular procedures without direct risk to patients, with measurable improvements in key performance metrics. How simulation training affects subsequent clinical performance has yet to be established.",

    "abstract": "This report describes the pilot of a free comprehensive national screening program for venous disease.\nThe screening process consisted of a venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment, abbreviated duplex examination for venous obstruction and reflux, inspection for signs of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), and an exit interview. Physicians coordinating the screenings were members of the American Venous Forum.\nSeventeen institutions screened 476 people (mean, 28 per site; range, 6 to 71). Mean age was 60 years (range, 40 to 91 years), with 78% women and 68% with a body mass index of > or =25. If placed in a situation conducive for VTE, 22 participants (5%) were low risk, 87 (18%) were moderate risk, 186 (39%) were high risk, and 179 (38%) were at very high risk. In 26 people (6%), one or more segments had venous obstruction, and 190 (40%) had one or more segments of venous reflux in the lower extremities. Varicose veins were present in 32%, edema without skin changes in 11%, skin changes attributable to venous disease in 8%, and healed or active venous stasis ulcer in 1.3% (CEAP classification 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Increasing age and increasing deep venous thrombosis risk score significantly correlated with increasing clinical classification, r = 0.09, P = .04, and r = 0.16, P = .0004, respectively. Those participants with reflux in one or more segments were significantly more likely to have a higher clinical classification compared with those with no reflux (P = .0001).\nThe first comprehensive national screening for venous disease was performed. Participants were informed of their risk for VTE if placed in a situation conducive to VTE, screened for evidence of obstruction, reflux, and CVI, and empowered to share their results with their primary care provider.",

Different techniques exist for controlling axillary sudoresis, but they are temporary and have high cost. This study was conducted to compare the initial results from sympathectomy using two distinct levels for treating axillary sudoresis: T3-T4 vs T4.\nSixty-two patients with axillary hyperhidrosis were prospectively randomized for denervation of T3-T4 or T4 alone. All patients were examined preoperatively and were followed-up at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Evaluated were the axillary hyperhidrosis treatment, the presence, location, and severity of compensatory hyperhidrosis, and the quality of life.\nAll the patients said that their axillary hyperhidrosis was successfully treated by the surgery after 6 months. There was no treatment failure. Compensatory hyperhidrosis was present in 29 patients (90.6%) of the T3-T4 group and in 17 T4 patients (56.7%) after 1 month. After 6 months, all the T3-T4 patients presented some degree of compensatory hyperhidrosis vs 13 T4 patients (43.3%). The severity of the compensatory hyperhidrosis was also lower in the T4 patients (P < . 01). The quality of life was poor in both groups before the surgery, and was equally improved in both groups after 1 and 6 months of follow-up. There were no deaths or significant postoperative complications nor a need for conversion to thoracotomy.\nBoth techniques are effective for treating axillary hyperhidrosis, but the T4 group presented milder compensatory hyperhidrosis and had a greater satisfaction rate.",

Although early results are encouraging, the extended durability remains unknown. We present the long-term surveillance results of CAS for post-CEA restenosis.\nBetween 1998 and 2004, 57 CAS procedures were performed in 55 patients (36 men) with a mean age of 70 years. The mean interval between CEA and CAS was 83 months (range, 6 to 245). Nine patients (16%) were symptomatic.\nCAS was performed successfully in all patients. No deaths or strokes occurred. A periprocedural transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in two patients. During a mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 12 to 72 months), two patients exhibited ipsilateral cerebral symptoms (1 TIA, 1 minor stroke). In 11 patients (19%), in-stent restenosis (> or =50%) was detected post-CAS at month 3 (n = 3), 12 (n = 3), 24 (n = 2), 36 (n = 1), 48 (n = 1), and 60 (n = 1). The cumulative rates of in-stent restenosis-free survival at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 93%, 85%, 82%, and 76%, respectively. Redo procedures were performed in six patients, three each received repeat angioplasty and repeat CEA with stent removal. The cumulative rates of freedom from reintervention at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 96%, 94%, 90%, and 84%, respectively.\nCarotid angioplasty and stenting for recurrent stenosis after CEA can be performed with a low incidence of periprocedural complications with durable protection from stroke. The rate of in-stent recurrent stenosis is high, however, and does not only occur early after CAS but is an ongoing process.",

The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.\nA prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.\nDuring the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.\nCAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis.",

The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.",

    "abstract": "The use of endovascular techniques to treat renal artery stenosis (RAS) has increased in recent years but remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes and durability of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTA/S) for patients with RAS and decreasing renal function.\nBetween 1999 and 2004, 125 consecutive patients underwent angiography and intervention for renal salvage and formed the basis of this study. Inclusion criteria for this study included serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL, ischemic nephropathy, and high-grade RAS perfusing a single functioning kidney. Patients undergoing PTA/S for renovascular hypertension or fibromuscular dysplasia or in conjunction with endovascular stent grafting for aneurysm repair were excluded. The original angiographic imaging was evaluated for lesion grade and parenchymal kidney size. All medical records and noninvasive testing were reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative patient data were standardized and analyzed by using chi(2) tests for nominal values and t tests for continuous variables. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation was used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and univariate analysis was performed.\nPreoperative variables included the presence of coronary artery disease (93%), diabetes (44%), tobacco use (48%), and hypercholesterolemia (70%). RAS was suspected on the basis of preoperative duplex imaging or magnetic resonance angiography. Aortography and PTA/S were performed in 125 patients (mean age, 71 years; 59% male) with a mean baseline creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL. There were two mortalities (1.6%) in the 30-day postoperative period, but there was no case of acute renal loss. Blood pressure decreased after PTA/S (151/79 mm Hg before vs 139/72 mm Hg after 1 month; P < .03). For all patients, the estimated GFR went from 33 +/- 12 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2) (mean +/- SD) to 37 +/- 19 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2) at 6 months (P = .10). Sixty-seven percent of treated patients had improvement (>10% increase in GFR) or stabilization of renal function. A rapid decline in GFR before intervention was correlated with improvement after PTA/S. Responders after PTA/S had a 27% decrease in GFR before intervention (44 +/- 13 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2) to 32 +/- 13 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2); P < .001) with a negative to positive slope change in GFR values. Ten patients underwent reintervention for in-stent restenosis. Cases without improvement in GFR after PTA/S were associated with eventual dialysis need (P = .01; mean follow-up, 19 months). Survival at 3 years was 76%, and dialysis-free survival was 63% as estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses.\nRenal artery stenoses causing renal dysfunction can be safely treated via endovascular means. Rapidly decreasing renal function is associated with the response to renal artery angioplasty/stenting and helps identify patients for renal salvage.",

    "abstract": "Small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs; 4-5.4 cm) are more likely to be suitable for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) than large aortic aneurysms (>5.5 cm). The purpose of this study was to determine whether small AAA growth is associated with the development of morphologic characteristics that decrease eligibility for EVAR.\nWe studied 54 patients who underwent 2 or more computed tomography scans with 3-dimensional reconstruction during surveillance of small AAAs. Morphologic aortic aneurysm features and changes were measured according to Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Suitability for EVAR was determined by neck anatomy (diameter, length, and angulations), iliac artery morphology, and total aortic aneurysm angulation and tortuosity.\nThe median age of the study cohort was 73 years (interquartile range [IQR], 65-77 years). The median follow-up period was 24 months (IQR, 15-36 months). The median small AAA diameter increased from 44.5 mm (IQR, 41-48 mm) to 48.9 mm (IQR, 45.7-52.0 mm). The median aortic neck diameter increased from 23.0 to 24.0 mm (P = .002), whereas median neck length decreased from 26.5 to 20.0 mm (P = .001). Aortic aneurysm median tortuosity index increased from 1.09 to 1.11 (P = .05). No significant changes in iliac artery morphology occurred. Overall, the anatomic suitability for endovascular repair did not significantly change during the study period (74% vs 69%; McNemar test; P = .25).\nChanges in aortic morphology are frequently associated with small AAA growth at mid-term follow-up, but such changes are minor and do not affect overall anatomic suitability for EVAR. These data reveal that continued surveillance of small AAAs does not threaten the window of opportunity for EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic stent grafts require proximal and distal landing zones of adequate length to effectively exclude thoracic aortic lesions. The origins of the left subclavian artery and other aortic arch branch vessels often impose limitations on the proximal landing zone, thereby disallowing endovascular repair of more proximal thoracic lesions.\nBetween October 2000 and November 2005, 112 patients received stent grafts to treat lesions involving the thoracic aorta. The proximal aspect of the stent graft partially or totally occluded the origin of at least one great vessel in 28 patients (25%). The proximal attachment site was in zone 0 in one patient (3.6%), zone 1 in three patients (10.7%), and zone 2 in 24 patients (85.7%). Patients with proximal implantation in zones 0 or 1 underwent debranching procedures of the supra-aortic vessels before stent graft repair. In one patient who underwent zone 1 deployment, the left subclavian artery was revascularized before stent graft deployment. Among patients who underwent zone 2 deployment with partial or complete occlusion of the left subclavian artery, none underwent prior revascularization. Patients were assessed postoperatively and at follow-up for development of neurologic symptoms as well as symptoms of left upper extremity claudication or ischemia.\nMean follow-up was 7.3 months. Among the 24 patients with zone 2 implantation, 10 (42%) had partial left subclavian artery coverage at the time of their primary procedure. A total of 19 patients experienced complete cessation of antegrade flow through the origin of the left subclavian artery without revascularization at the time of the initial endograft repair as a result of a secondary procedure or as a consequence of left subclavian artery thrombosis. Left upper extremity symptoms developed in three (15.8%) patients that did not warrant intervention, and rest pain developed in one (5.3%), which was treated with the deployment of a left subclavian artery stent. Two primary (type IA and type III) endoleaks (7.1%) and one secondary endoleak (type IA) (3.6%) were observed in patients who underwent zone 2 deployment. Three cerebrovascular accidents were observed. Thoracic aortic lesions were successfully excluded in all patients who underwent supra-aortic debranching procedures.\nIntentional coverage of the origin of the left subclavian artery to obtain an adequate proximal landing zone during endovascular repair of thoracic aortic lesions is well tolerated and may be managed expectantly, with some exceptions.",

    "abstract": "With the US Food and Drug Administration approval of the TAG thoracic device, more thoracic pathologies are being treated using endovascular techniques. Although endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic repairs have some apparent similarities, there are substantive anatomic, pathologic, and technical differences that could impact perioperative outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify these differences.\nDuring a 5-year period, 121 endovascular thoracic aortic repairs (TEVAR) and 450 abdominal aortic repairs (EVAR) were performed at a single institution. Preoperative, intraoperative, and early postoperative data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed. Aggregate outcome measures were compared between the two cohorts, with statistical significance achieved at P < .05.\nThe mean age of patients undergoing EVAR was 72.8 +/- 8.3 compared with 68.3 +/- 13.9 for TEVAR (P = .02). More women underwent TEVAR (30.6% vs 11.1%, P < .001). Aneurysms undergoing TEVAR were larger than those for EVAR (62.0 mm vs 58.3 mm, P = .01). Intraoperatively, EVAR required 26.2 minutes of fluoroscopy compared with 22.1 minutes for TEVAR (P < .001). The amount of contrast used was higher in TEVAR (133.6 mL vs 93.6 mL, P < .001). The mean procedure times were 164 minutes for EVAR and 115 minutes for TEVAR (P < .001). Iliac conduits were required in 46 patients (10.2%) undergoing EVAR, and in 24 (19.8%) undergoing TEVAR (P = .007). The 30-day or in-hospital mortality was 2.0% for EVAR and 5.0% for TEVAR (P = NS). The median length of stay was longer for TEVAR (3 days vs 2 days, P =.034). There were 54 postoperative complications in 36 TEVAR patients (29.8%), including 13 neurologic (10.7%), 8 renal (6.6%), 7 pulmonary (5.8%), 6 ischemic (5.0), and 5 (4.1%) hemorrhagic events. Among the EVAR group, 136 (30.2%) patients had postoperative complications, which included 45 ischemic (10.0%), 34 wound (7.6%), 22 renal (4.9%), 12 cardiac (2.7%), 8 pulmonary (1.8%), 5 gastrointestinal (1.1%), and 4 neurologic (0.9%) events.\nA relatively higher proportion of women underwent TEVAR than EVAR, and this was reflected in the greater need for iliac conduits to accommodate the larger delivery catheters of the thoracic devices. Intraoperative imaging techniques were also different, and TEVAR required higher contrast volumes despite shorter overall procedure times. The incidence of strokes and spinal cord ischemia was also higher during TEVAR. Despite apparent similarities of devices and techniques, EVAR and TEVAR are fundamentally different procedures with different perioperative outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In a proportion of patients with an endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), aortic cuffs or iliac graft limb extensions are required to enhance sealing or to fix the position of the device. This requirement arises when these goals are not primarily obtained with the basic stent-graft configuration. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the use of endograft extensions during the primary EVAR procedure on the short- and long-term outcome.\nThe study was based on the data of the EUROSTAR registry. Patient and anatomic characteristics, data regarding the procedure, postoperative complications, and the mortality of patients undergoing EVAR were retrieved from the database. Patients were divided into three groups: (1) no extensions, (2) proximal aortic cuffs, and (3) iliac limb extensions. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare significant influences of the use of cuffs or extensions on different outcomes relative to control patients, adjusted for patient and anatomic factors.\nThe overall cohort comprised 6668 patients: 4932 (74.0%) without extensions, 259 (3.9%) with an aortic cuff, and 1477 (22.2%) with an iliac endograft extension. Both the 30-day (2.3%-3.9%) and the all-cause mortality rates (23%-27% at 4 years) were similar in the three study groups. The use of proximal cuffs or iliac extensions did not have an effect on the incidence of endoleaks of any type (24%-32% at 4 years). The incidences of device kinking (P = .0344) and secondary transfemoral interventions (P = .0053) during follow-up were increased in patients in whom iliac limb extensions were used. In patients with aortic cuffs, no significant associations with altered outcome were observed.\nThe use of iliac graft limb extensions at EVAR was associated with a higher incidence of kinking and secondary transfemoral interventions, whereas proximal aortic cuffs did not influence outcome.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative knowledge of the blood-supplying trajectory to the spinal cord is of interest, because spinal cord ischemia may occur during thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair and possibly leads to paraplegia. The Adamkiewicz artery (AKA) is considered to be the most important blood supplier of the thoracolumbar spinal cord and has therefore been the focus in preoperative diagnostic imaging. However, in TAA(A) patients, the blood supply to the spinal cord may strongly depend on (intersegmental) collateral circulation, because many segmental arteries are occluded as a result of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the importance of preserving the segmental artery supplying the AKA (SA-AKA) is debated. Here it was investigated whether (1) the AKA and its segmental supplier can be imaged by using magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and (2) aortic cross-clamping of the SA-AKA influences intraoperative spinal cord function, monitored by motor evoked potentials (MEPs).\nPreoperative MR angiography was performed to localize the SA-AKA and the AKA in 60 patients (19 TAA, 7 TAAA I, 18 TAAA II, 9 TAAA III, and 7 TAAA IV). Spinal cord function was monitored during surgery by using MEPs. When MEPs indicated critical ischemia, the SA-AKA was selectively reattached. To test whether aortic cross-clamping of the SA-AKA was associated with MEP decline, the Fisher statistical exactness test was applied.\nThe AKA and SA-AKA could be localized in all 60 (100%) patients between vertebral levels T8 and L2 (72% left sided). In 44 (73%) patients, the SA-AKA was cross-clamped, which led in 32% (14/44) of cases to MEP decline. Reattachment of the preoperatively localized SA-AKA re-established MEPs and, thus, spinal cord function in 12 of 14 cases. When the SA-AKA was outside the area cross-clamped, the MEPs always remained stable. A significant association (P < .01) was found between the location of the SA-AKA relative to the aortic cross-clamps and the MEPs.\nThe AKA can be localized before surgery in 100% of TAA(A) patients by using MR angiography. Location of the SA-AKA outside the cross-clamped aortic area is attended with stable MEPs. Interestingly, it was found that in most patients in whom the SA-AKA was cross-clamped, MEPs were not affected, thus indicating sufficient collateral blood supply to maintain spinal cord integrity. Nevertheless, preoperative knowledge of SA-AKA location is of importance, because in 32% of patients, spinal cord function was dependent on this supplier. Revascularization of the SA-AKA can thereby reverse spinal cord dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The prothrombotic, hypofibrinolytic state that develops in patients with intermittent claudication (IC) upon walking due to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the leg muscles may contribute to the high incidence of life- and limb-threatening thrombotic events observed in this patient group. Treatments, such as angioplasty, that obtund the IRI also ameliorate the procoagulant diathesis. The effect on this diathesis of supervised exercise and cilostazol, both of which provide symptomatic benefit in IC, but without significantly obtunding IRI, is unknown.\nThirty-four patients (27 men and 7 women; median age, 67 years; range, 63-72 years) were randomized to receive best medical therapy (BMT) plus supervised exercise (n = 9), BMT plus cilostazol (n = 9), BMT plus supervised exercise plus cilostazol (n = 7), or BMT alone (n = 9) in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Thrombin-antithrombin complex and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2, both markers of thrombin generation; plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen and tissue plasminogen activator antigen, both markers of fibrinolysis; ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI); and initial and absolute claudication distance (ACD) were measured at baseline and then 3 and 6 months after randomization.\nAt 6 months, when compared with receiving BMT only, supervised exercise and cilostazol resulted in improvements in ABPI of 18% and 13% and in ACD of 40% and 64%, respectively. The effects on ABPI and ACD of combining supervised exercise and cilostazol were additive. Supervised exercise, cilostazol, and supervised exercise combined with cilostazol had no significant effect on any of the four hemostatic markers.\nTreatment of IC by supervised exercise or cilostazol results in significant improvements in ABPI and ACD but has no demonstrable effect on the prothrombotic diathesis. This suggests that supervised exercise and cilostazol, unlike angioplasty, are unlikely to have a long-term beneficial effect on the thrombotic risks faced by these patients.",

    "abstract": "A consequence of delay in the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease limb loss. This study was undertaken to determine the correlation of low socioeconomic status and race on the severity of ischemic presentation and the subsequent amputation rate.\nData from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 1998 to 2002 on patients from urban hospitals with the diagnosis of lower extremity ischemia were evaluated. The population was divided into two groups: the amputation group (AMP) and lower extremity revascularization group (LER). Comorbidities, age, gender, race, ischemic gangrene at presentation, insurance status (no/noncommercial or commercial), and income status at admission were determined. These variables were compared using multivariate logistic regression analyses of the data for risk adjustment.\nOf 691,833 patients presenting with lower extremity ischemia, 363,193 underwent revascularization (66.3%) or amputation (33.7%). Univariate analysis correlated a statistically significant (P < .0001) higher rate of amputation and multivariate analysis associated significantly higher odds of amputation with the following variables: nonwhites (1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65, 2.20), low-income bracket (1.41, 95% CI, 1.18, 1.60), and Medicare & Medicaid (1.81, 95% CI, 1.66, 1.97). Adjusting for other variables of statistical significance, multivariate regression analysis showed a statistically significant risk for amputation based on the nonteaching status of the institution (odds ratio [OR], 1.17, 95% CI, 1.08, 1.30).\nPrimary amputation was performed with a higher frequency on patients with lower extremity ischemia who were nonwhite, low income, and without commercial insurance. The observed advanced ischemia among these economically disadvantaged patients suggests a delayed diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, probably due to lack of access to adequate primary care or vascular surgery providers, or both. Better education of the general population and primary care providers to the symptoms and consequences of PVD may reduce the amputation rate in this group.",

We examined which baseline variables are related to future vascular events, investigated the course of vascular risk factors, and compared the number of vascular risk factors at baseline and at follow-up to determine whether risk factor management could be further improved.\nThis study involved 461 patients with Fontaine classification II to IV who were enrolled in the SMART study (Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease) from September 1996 to December 2000. Patients underwent a standardized screening program for risk factors and were invited for a follow-up measurement during September 2003 to March 2005, after a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (SD, 1.3 years). In the interim period between baseline and follow-up measurement, patients received usual care. During follow-up, vascular events (mortality, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction) and PAD-related events (vascular surgery, interventions, and amputations) were documented in detail.\nIn 2739 person-years of follow-up, 91 vascular events occurred, resulting in a 29.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.8%-35.4%) cumulative incidence proportion of recurrent vascular events. Older age, increased homocysteine levels, impaired renal function, and a history of coronary heart disease at baseline were related to an increased risk of new vascular events. Of the 461 patients, 108 patients died, 20 patients were lost to follow-up, and 333 patients were eligible for follow-up measurement, in which 221 (66%) patients wished to participate. In 8 of the 221 patients, a nonfatal vascular event occurred during follow-up. The prevalence of hypertension increased from 51% to 70% (95% CI, 10%-28%), the prevalence of obesity increased from 54% to 67% (95% CI, 3%-21%), and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increased from 8% to 16% (95% CI, 2%-14%).

Medication use increased in all drug categories during follow-up.\nAge, increased homocysteine levels, impaired renal function, and a history of coronary heart disease were independent risk factors for vascular events in patients with symptomatic PAD. The prevalence of most risk factors, except for smoking and hyperlipidemia, increased over a 5.5-year period even though medication use increased over the same period.",

The present study reports results from a prospective multicenter registry designed to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and patency of the aSpire self-expanding polytetrafluoroethylene covered stent (Vascular Architects Inc, San Jose, Calif) in patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease.\nThe aSpire Registry included 150 patients (166 limbs) enrolled in 16 centers during a 28-month period (2003 to 2005) for medium/long (>3 cm) occlusion (n = 115) or stenosis (n = 51) of the SFA (n = 51) or of the proximal popliteal (n = 115) arteries. Procedures were performed for intermittent claudication in 92, for rest pain in 33, and for limb savage in 41. The mean length of arterial segment covered was 107.35 +/- 73.7 mm. Indications for treatment included 44 type B1, 57 type B2, 47 type C1, and 18 type D lesions according to TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification. Clinical and ultrasound evaluation was performed at discharge and at 1, 6, 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Mean follow-up was 13 months (range, 1 to 36). Primary end points were immediate technical success (vessel recanalization with residual stenosis < or =30%) and stent patency.\nInitial technical success was obtained in 162 (97.6%) of 166 procedures. More than one stent was applied in 48 procedures, for a total of 214 stents. No periprocedural deaths occurred. Procedure-related complications occurred in 22 of 166 procedures, including 6 peripheral embolizations, 7 thromboses, 2 hemorrhages requiring revision, 1 vessel rupture, and 6 vessel dissections. Life-table estimates of primary patency at 12, 24, and 36 months were 64%, 59%, and 59%, respectively. Thirty-two reinterventions were performed during follow-up, resulting in secondary patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months of 74.2%, 67%, and 67%, respectively. Amputation was required in six of 41 patients treated for limb salvage. At multivariate analysis, critical limb ischemia was the only significant predictor of late failure.\nEndovascular treatment of SFA occlusive lesions provides interesting results. Length of lesion and clinical symptoms influence negatively the patency. The aSpire covered stent showed good mid-term results, but a number of reinterventions were necessary to obtain an optimal secondary patency. Risk of patency failure was related to critical limb ischemia as an indication for the procedure. Technologic and pharmacologic improvement and longer follow-up are needed to define the indications for the aSpire stent.",

The aSpire covered stent showed good mid-term results, but a number of reinterventions were necessary to obtain an optimal secondary patency.

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to detail the early experience after infrainguinal atherectomy using the Silverhawk plaque excision catheter for the treatment of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.\nA prospective database was established in August 2004 in which data for operations, outcomes, and follow-up were recorded for patients undergoing percutaneous plaque excision for peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) ischemia scores and femoropopliteal TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) criteria were assigned. A follow-up protocol included duplex ultrasound surveillance at 1, 3, and 6 months and then yearly thereafter. Standard statistical analyses were performed.\nDuring a 17-month period, 66 limbs of 60 patients (37 men [61.7%]) underwent 70 plaque excisions (four repeat procedures). Indications included tissue loss based on SVS ischemia at grades 5 and 6 (25/70), rest pain at grade 4 (22/70), and claudication at grades 2 to 3 (23/70). The mean lesion length was 8.8 +/- 0.7 cm. The technical success rate was 87.1% (61/70). Adjunctive treatment was required in 17 procedures (24.3%), consisting of 14 balloon angioplasties and three stents. Femoropopliteal TASC criteria included 5 TASC A lesions, 14 TASC B lesions, 32 TASC C lesions, and 19 TASC D lesions. Although 17 plaque excisions included a tibial vessel, no patient underwent isolated tibial atherectomy. The mean increase in ankle-brachial index was 0.27 +/- 0.04 and in toe pressure, 20.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg. Mean duplex ultrasound follow-up was 5.2 months (range, 1 to 17 months). One-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency was 61.7%, 64.1%, and 76.4%, respectively. Restenosis or occlusion developed in 12 patients (16.7%) and was detected at a mean of 2.8 +/- 0.7 months. Restenosis or occlusion was significantly more common (P < .05) in patients with TASC C and D lesions compared with patients with TASC A and B lesions. Six (8.3%) of 12 patients underwent reintervention on the basis of duplex ultrasound surveillance results. Four (33.3%) of 12 patients experienced reocclusion during the same hospitalization, and amputation and open revascularization were required in two patients each.\nPercutaneous plaque excision is a viable treatment option for lower extremity revascularization. Outcomes are related to ischemia and lesion severity. Patency and limb salvage rates are equivalent to other endovascular modalities.",

    "abstract": "This randomized prospective study was designed to compare the effectiveness of treating superficial femoral artery occlusive disease percutaneously with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)/nitinol self-expanding stent grafts vs surgical femoral-to-above knee (AK) popliteal artery bypass with synthetic graft material.\nFrom March 2004 to May 2005, 100 limbs in 86 patients with femoral-popliteal arterial occlusive disease were identified. Patients had symptoms ranging from claudication to rest pain, with or without tissue loss, and were prospectively randomized for treatment into one of two groups. The limbs were treated percutaneously with angioplasty and one or more self-expanding stent grafts (n = 50) or surgically with femoral-to-AK popliteal artery bypass using synthetic Dacron or ePTFE grafts (n = 50). The mean +/- SD total length of artery stented was 25.6 +/- 15 cm. Follow-up evaluation with ankle-brachial indices and color flow duplex sonography imaging were performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment.\nPatients were monitored for a median of 18 months. No statistical difference was found in the primary patency (P = .895) or secondary patency (P = .861) between the two treatment groups. Primary patency at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up was 84%, 82%, 75.6%, and 73.5% for the stent graft group and 90%, 81.8%, 79.7%, and 74.2% for the femoral-popliteal surgical group. Thirteen patients in the stent graft group had 14 reinterventions, and 12 reinterventions occurred in the surgical group. This resulted in secondary patency rates of 83.9% for the stent graft group and 83.7% for the surgical group at the 12-month follow-up.\nManagement of femoral-popliteal arterial occlusive disease using percutaneous treatment with a stent graft is comparable with surgical revascularization with conventional femoral-to-AK popliteal artery bypass using synthetic material up to 12 months. Longer-term follow-up would be helpful in determining ongoing efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as an independent predictor of coronary artery disease; however, its importance in peripheral arterial disease is less clear. The aim of this study was to assess the association between obesity and the severity and outcome of intermittent claudication.\nThis study was a prospective cohort study based at a tertiary referral center. Sixty patients with intermittent claudication selected for conservative treatment were assessed for obesity and metabolic syndrome by using the International Diabetes Federation definition. Other risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, serum lipids, adipocytokines, and C-reactive protein, were measured by clinical and blood assessment. Obesity and metabolic syndrome were related to the severity of peripheral arterial disease, defined by ankle-brachial pressure index and graded treadmill measured maximum walking distance (MWD) and initial claudication distance, by using multiple linear regression analysis allowing for traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. Patients were followed up for 24 months, and combined outcome was reported in terms of death, cardiovascular events, or requirement for revascularization. The effect of obesity and metabolic syndrome on outcome was investigated by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis.\nObesity and serum adiponectin were independently associated with the severity of peripheral arterial disease measured by ankle-brachial pressure index (P = .03 and .001), initial claudication distance (P = .009 and .03), and MWD (P = .001 and .04). Metabolic syndrome was independently associated only with MWD (P = .02). By 24 months, outcome events occurred in 37% +/- 7% and 43% +/- 9% of patients with metabolic syndrome or obesity, respectively, compared with 0% and 11% +/- 6% of those without these diagnoses. Waist circumference independently predicted the likelihood of outcome events (relative risk, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.26; P < .001).\nThese findings, if confirmed in other cohorts, suggest the importance of treating obesity in patients with intermittent claudication. Serum adiponectin concentrations may be an important guide to the efficacy of treatment in patients with intermittent claudication and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and with the severity of peripheral arterial disease. The effects of inflammation on the development of vein graft disease remain speculative. We hypothesized that high levels of inflammatory markers would identify patients at increased risk for adverse events (graft failure, major cardiovascular events) after lower extremity bypass surgery.\nPatients (n = 91) scheduled to undergo lower extremity bypass using autogenous vein were enrolled into a prospective study at two institutions. Exclusion criteria included the presence of major infection. A baseline plasma sample was obtained on the morning of lower extremity bypass. Biomarkers for inflammation included hsCRP, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A (SAA). Values between patients with and without critical limb ischemia were compared. Proportions of events among dichotomized populations (upper limit of normal of each laboratory assay) were compared by log-rank test.\nOf the patients undergoing lower extremity bypass, 69% were men, 53% were diabetic, 81% were smokers, and their mean ankle-brachial index was 0.51 +/- 0.19. The indication for lower extremity bypass was critical limb ischemia in 55%. There were no perioperative deaths and two early graft occlusions. During a mean follow-up of 342 days (range, 36-694 days) there were four deaths, 27 graft-related events, and 10 other cardiovascular events. No relationships were found between events and demographics, comorbidities, baseline ankle-brachial index, or statin use. High-sensitivity CRP (P = .005), fibrinogen (P < .001), and SAA (P = .0001) levels were associated with critical limb ischemia at presentation. Among patients with an elevated hsCRP (>5 mg/L) immediately before surgery, major postoperative vascular events occurred in 60% (21/35), compared with a 32% (18/56) rate in those with a baseline CRP <5 mg/L (P = .004, log-rank test). On multivariable analysis, only elevated hsCRP correlated with adverse graft-related or cardiovascular events (P = .018).\nThe inflammatory biomarkers of hsCRP, fibrinogen, and SAA correlate with peripheral arterial disease severity at presentation in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass. Patients with elevated hsCRP are at increased risk for postoperative vascular events, most of which are related to the vein graft. These findings suggest a potential relationship between inflammation and outcomes after lower extremity vein bypass surgery.",

    "results": "Of the patients undergoing lower extremity bypass, 69% were men, 53% were diabetic, 81% were smokers, and their mean ankle-brachial index was 0.51 +/- 0.19. The indication for lower extremity bypass was critical limb ischemia in 55%. There were no perioperative deaths and two early graft occlusions. During a mean follow-up of 342 days (range, 36-694 days) there were four deaths, 27 graft-related events, and 10 other cardiovascular events. No relationships were found between events and demographics, comorbidities, baseline ankle-brachial index, or statin use. High-sensitivity CRP (P = .005), fibrinogen (P < .001), and SAA (P = .0001) levels were associated with critical limb ischemia at presentation. Among patients with an elevated hsCRP (>5 mg/L) immediately before surgery, major postoperative vascular events occurred in 60% (21/35), compared with a 32% (18/56) rate in those with a baseline CRP <5 mg/L (P = .004, log-rank test). On multivariable analysis, only elevated hsCRP correlated with adverse graft-related or cardiovascular events (P = .018).",

    "abstract": "This study compared the incidence and characteristics of graft infection in patients who underwent early vs late revisional surgery of lower extremity arterial bypass grafts.\nBetween 1992 and July 2005, 500 revisional procedures were performed on 198 lower extremity bypass grafts. Patients whose revisions were performed <30 days after the primary bypass were in the early revision (ER) group (n = 99), and those done >30 days after bypass were in the late revision (LR) group (n = 99). Infection was defined as cellulitis with graft exposure or purulence in continuity with a graft that required antibiotics and operation for infection control. Mean follow-up was 60 months (range, 2 to 60 months). Groups were compared using Student's t test.\nThe ER group included 66 autogenous and 33 prosthetic grafts. The LR group consisted of 53 autogenous and 46 prosthetic grafts. Of the 500 revisional procedures performed, 17 graft infections occurred (3.4%). Twelve (70.6%) were prosthetic grafts and five (29.4%) were autogenous grafts (P = .004). Defining the infection rate per graft rather than per revisional procedure, the ER group had a significantly higher graft infection rate at 11% (11/99) compared with 6.1% in the LR group (6/99; P = .012). The risk of infection for prosthetic grafts was significantly higher within the ER group at 27.3% (9/33) compared with autogenous grafts at 3.1% (2/66; P = .0001). Infection developed in three vein grafts and three prosthetic grafts in the LR group (P = NS). For prosthetic graft revisions only, infection risk was 27.3% (9/33) in the ER group and 6.5% (3/46) in the LR group (P = .005). The most common cultured pathogen was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ER, 6/11 vs LR, 3/6; P = NS). Within the ER group, the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly higher at 27.3% (3/11) compared with 0% (0/6) in the LR group (P = .04).\nEarly revision of lower extremity arterial bypass grafts has a significantly higher risk of graft infection compared with revision >1 month after surgery. Infection will develop in approximately 25% (9/33) of prosthetic grafts that are reoperated on early. If feasible, reoperation should be delayed >1 month for prosthetic grafts needing revision. Endovascular or extra-anatomic interventions should be considered if early revision is mandated in this group.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated whether popliteal artery volume flow (PAVF) measured immediately after balloon angioplasties of the superficial femoral artery-popliteal segments (SFA/POP) was predictive of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis.\nDuring the last 24 months, 203 patients (56% men) with a mean age of 73 +/- 9 years had 268 duplex-guided balloon angioplasties of the SFA/POP. Critical ischemia was the indication in 36%. Group I included 176 (66%) with stenoses, and group II had 92 (34%) with occlusions. All patients had completion duplex examinations that included three measurements of PAVF of below-the-knee popliteal artery.\nEarly (30 days) thrombosis of the treated femoropopliteal arterial segment developed in 10 patients (3.7%), three in group I (1.7%) and seven in group II (7.6%; P < .04). All 10 cases of early thrombosis were in patients with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) class C (6/185, 3.2%) and D (4/26, 15%) lesions. Moreover, the 19% incidence (n = 4) of early thrombosis in patients with PAVF <100 mL/min (mean, 73 +/- 24 mL/min; range, 20 to 99 mL/min) was higher compared with the 2.4% rate for patients with higher flows (mean, 176 +/- 60 mL/min; range, 100 to 450 mL/min; P < .01). At 6 months of follow-up, femoropopliteal occlusions had developed in nine more patients, and it became apparent that low PAVF measurements were still predictive of thrombosis (29%) when compared with higher PAVF cases (6%; P < .002). Log-rank comparison of survival curves for cumulative primary stenosis-free patency in group I and group II demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < .02). PAVF <100 mL/min and TASC classification were significant predictors of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis after femoropopliteal angioplasties. PAVF was the most powerful predictor of arterial thrombosis. The respective 6-month and 12-month limb salvage rates were 98% and 94% for patients with claudication and 88% and 85% for those with limb-threatening ischemia (P < .0001).\nOur results demonstrate that low PAVF is the most powerful predictor of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis after femoropopliteal interventions. In the presence of a low postprocedure PAVF (<100 mL/min), one may consider not reversing the heparin or using intermittent calf compression, or both, to augment the arterial flow.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is now routinely performed with embolic protection devices, yet little is known about the compositional characteristics of the captured embolic debris and whether the type or quantity of debris correlates with patient, lesion, or operator characteristics. This study examined the embolic debris generated during CAS using electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\nBetween 2003 and 2005, CAS for carotid stenosis was performed in 175 patients. Cerebral protection devices were used in all but three cases. Sixty-four consecutive unselected microporous filters from procedures performed by a single vascular surgeon were obtained for analysis. Captured particulate debris within the protection devices was quantified (number and mean size of particles) by light microscopy for all filters. Twenty protection devices (9 symptomatic, 11 asymptomatic patients) were processed for electron microscopy and EDS to assess morphology, cellular composition, and calcium content of debris.\nCaptured particulate matter was present in 49 filters (77%) and included particles measuring 200 to 500 mum in 72%, 500 to 1000 mum in 53%, and >1000 mum in 33%. The mean number of captured particles was 6.9, and mean size was 248 +/- 150 mum. Univariate analysis revealed that sequential patient cohort and filter type were correlated with the number (but not size) of captured particles. The number of particles significantly decreased after the first cohort of 20 patients (11.5 particles) compared with the second (5.0 particles, P = .023) and third (5.2 particles, P = .029) cohorts. The type of captured debris ranged from sheets of damaged red blood cells without other components to clumps of recently activated platelets with early fibrin crosslinking to plaque debris coated with well-organized coalescing areas of platelet thrombus. Platelet activation was more common in symptomatic patients (78%) than asymptomatic patients (27%; P < .05). Despite the presence of calcified lesions in six patients whose filters were analyzed by EDS, <1% of energy emission on EDS of scanned particulate debris fell within the emission range of calcium, indicating the presence of minimal calcium in the embolic particles.\nParticulate embolic debris is released in most patients during CAS and can measure >1000 mum in one third of patients. The number of particles may decrease with increasing operator experience with CAS. Debris captured during CAS with embolic protection exhibits a range of cellular and acellular components on electron microscopy, with a higher prevalence of platelet activation evident in symptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the original-permeability Excluder (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) has been associated with postoperative sac expansion in the absence of endoleak. In these cases, we have performed an endovascular revision, relining the original endograft with another Excluder, in an effort to arrest sac expansion by reducing permeability. We have studied these cases to determine the effect of relining on aneurysm expansion.\nPatients who demonstrated sac expansion (>or=5 mm diameter, >or=5% three-dimensional volume) after EVAR with the original Excluder were evaluated. Between 1999 and 2004, the original-permeability endoprosthesis was used in 97 patients who underwent EVAR for asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Sac expansion occurred in 24 patients, of which multiple imaging modalities showed 12 had expansion without demonstrable endoleak. Nine of the 12 have had endovascular relining, and five of these nine have >6 months follow-up to form the primary basis for this report.\nAAA size was stable or smaller in the first 6 months after the original EVAR for all patients. Once expansion began (typically in the time frame of 6 to 12 months), multimodality imaging showed no aneurysm spontaneously decreased in size without intervention, despite the absence of endoleak (n = 12). Expansion exceeded clinically significant thresholds at 30 months (mean) by diameter criteria and 22 months (mean) by three-dimensional volume criteria for the five patients with >6 months follow-up after relining. Endovascular relining was performed at a mean of 36 months, with a mean hospital stay of 1 day, and no morbidity or mortality. Over the entire duration of expansion (mean, 26 months), aneurysms expanded by 6.0 +/- 1 mm/year diameter and by 12% +/- 2%/year by three-dimensional volume. At a mean of 16 months follow-up after relining with another Excluder, the mean diameter decrease was 2.0 mm/year (P < .03) and the mean volume decrease was 2.6%/year (P < .01). After relining, all AAAs were smaller by diameter or volume, or both, exceeding thresholds defining shrinkage in two of the five with >6 months follow-up after relining. There was no rupture, migration, endoleak, conversion to open repair, or aneurysm-related death in any patient.\nIt appears from the initial follow-up that AAA expansion owing to permeability issues after EVAR with the original Excluder can be arrested by endovascular relining with a low-permeability Excluder endoprosthesis.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to assess the efficacy and rate of complications of endovenous laser treatment (EVLT) of the short saphenous vein (SSV).\nDuring a 17-month period, 210 (187 patients) with SSV incompetence documented by duplex ultrasound studies were treated with EVLT using a 980-nm diode laser. Duplex ultrasound examinations were performed on the day of the procedure, within the first week, and 2 to 11 months after the procedure (mean follow-up, 4 months). Clinical examinations were performed at 2 weeks and 6 weeks. Patients were assessed for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), nerve injury, and resolution of symptoms.\nAll procedures were technically successful, and in the 126 patients (60%) who completed final follow-up scanning, 96% of SSVs remained closed. Three patients (1.6%) had numbness at the lateral malleolus at the 6-week follow-up. DVT, defined as a tail of thrombus protruding into the popliteal vein, was not detected in any limbs at the initial duplex study, but was noted in 12 limbs (5.7%) at the 1-week follow-up examination. Nine patients were treated with 3 days to 3 months of fractionated heparin and Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), and there were no DVT extensions or pulmonary emboli. The anatomic configuration of the saphenopopliteal junction was the only factor predictive of DVT.\nIntermediate-term results of EVLT of the SSV demonstrate that the technique is effective at eliminating SSV reflux and affording symptomatic relief. The incidence of nerve injury is low, but the incidence of DVT is higher than reported for the great saphenous vein. Anatomic features of the SSV may predict patient risk for DVT.",

Nine patients were treated with 3 days to 3 months of fractionated heparin and Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), and there were no DVT extensions or pulmonary emboli. The anatomic configuration of the saphenopopliteal junction was the only factor predictive of DVT.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative localization of the Adamkiewicz artery and its segmental supplier in advance of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair is proposed to be useful to prevent postoperative paraplegia. The diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) was evaluated for the preoperative localization of the Adamkiewicz artery in white TAAA patients.\nThirty-nine consecutive patients with a TAA(A) scheduled for elective open surgical aortic repair preoperatively underwent MRA and CTA. Objective image quality was assessed by measuring the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the Adamkiewicz artery and was related to patient thickness. Two independent observers scored the location of the Adamkiewicz artery and the subjective image quality of vessel-background contrast of the Adamkiewicz artery, image noise, spinal cord tissue enhancement, epidural venous enhancement, and overall image quality.\nAverage detection rate for Adamkiewicz artery localization was 71% (67% to 74%) for CTA and 97% (94% to 100%) for MRA. Interobserver agreement was 82% for CTA and 94% for MRA. Signal-to-noise ratio was significantly higher (P < .001) and contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly (P < .001) lower for CTA than for MRA. Contrast of the Adamkiewicz artery (P < .001) and overall image quality (P < .004) were judged to be significantly better for MRA. Spinal cord tissue enhancement was judged stronger at CTA (P < .03), with significantly less epidural venous enhancement (P < .001). No significant difference was found in image noise. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise decreased significantly (P < .001) with increasing patient thickness for CTA but not for MRA.\nLocalization of the Adamkiewicz artery in white TAAA patients is possible with both CTA and MRA. Compared with CTA, MRA is more favorable because of the higher Adamkiewicz artery detection rate, the higher contrast-to-noise ratio, and its independence of patient thickness.",

    "abstract": "The optimal revascularization strategy in diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) is unclear. This study assessed the efficacy of tailored endovascular-first vs surgical-first revascularization stratified for the presence of diabetes.\nThis prospective cohort study, with 1-year follow up, was conducted in a tertiary referral center in a consecutive series of 383 patients (45.7% had diabetes) presenting 426 limbs with chronic CLI. Interventions were endovascular (PTA cohort, 207 limbs) or surgical (SURG cohort, 85 limbs) revascularization. Conservatively treated patients without revascularization (NON REVASC cohort, 108 limbs) were used as a reference. The main outcome measures were sustained clinical success, defined as survival without major amputation or repeated target extremity revascularization (TER), and a categoric upward shift in clinical symptoms according to the Rutherford classification.\nSustained clinical success of revascularization was significantly better in nondiabetic patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.72; P = .001 [SURG cohort]; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.78; P = .002 [PTA cohort]) compared with diabetic patients (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.43, P = .45 [SURG cohort]; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.27, P = .40 [PTA cohort]). Repeated TER significantly improved clinical success, which became equivalent between diabetic and nondiabetic patients (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.4). In multivariate analysis, treatment success was not influenced by mode of initial revascularization, neither in diabetic nor in nondiabetic patients. Cumulative 1-year mortality was 30.4%, with a trend of increased mortality in patients with diabetes (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.17; P = .064). Limb salvage rates were similar in treatment cohorts, also if stratified for diabetes (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.75).\nDiabetic patients with chronic CLI benefit from early revascularization. To achieve this benefit, multiple revascularization procedures may be required, and close surveillance is therefore mandatory.

    "abstract": "The potentially devastating complication of total or near total thoracic endoprosthesis collapse has been described with the TAG device (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz). This rare complication has resulted in a warning to clinicians and speculation about the etiology of this problem. This report evaluates potential causative anatomic factors that may increase the probability of endoprosthesis collapse in patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aneurysm repair (TEVAR).\nPreoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans were collected worldwide representing six patients who had experienced radiologically confirmed TAG endoprosthesis collapse. These were compared with a matched cohort of five patients with a TAG endoprosthesis in the same anatomic position in which no collapse occurred. Anatomic variables of aortic arch angulation, apposition, intraluminal lip length, proximal aortic diameter, distal aortic diameter, intragraft aortic diameter, percentage of oversizing, and angle of the proximal endograft to the aortic arch were compared between groups. Differences between groups were determined using the Student t test, with P < .05 considered significant.\nThe two groups (collapse vs no collapse) were evenly matched demographically, and all underwent endoluminal treatment with the TAG device, with no differences in gender, graft position in the aorta, operative indication, or age (P = NS). Distal sealing zone aortic diameter +/- standard deviation of 18.9 +/- 1.7 mm vs 22.7 +/- 2.7 mm and minimum aortic diameter within the endograft of 18.6 +/- 1.7 mm vs 22.4 +/- 3.1 mm predicted collapse (P < .05). Proximal aortic diameter, apposition, intraluminal lip length, aortic arch angle, and angle of proximal endograft to aortic arch did not predict collapse (P = NS).\nThoracic endograft collapse is an exceedingly rare event. In this series, endoprosthesis collapse occurred in patients who were treated outside the manufacturer's instructions for use for minimum required aortic diameter. Although distal aortic diameter and minimum intragraft aortic diameter predicted collapse, other variables may also influence this complication but were not significant owing to potential type II statistical errors. In the future, caution should be exercised when contemplating TEVAR in patients with small (<23 mm) aortic diameters.",

A specimen of human fibrinous thrombus was positioned under the weights. Because the surface area of the weights and the thrombus was 400 mm(2), weights 1, 2, and 3 caused pressures of 88, 108, and 127 mm Hg, respectively.

    "abstract": "Depression is associated with worse outcomes after coronary artery bypass surgery, but its association with the results after revascularization for symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is unknown. This study assessed the association between depression and patency, recurrent symptoms, and limb salvage after revascularization for symptomatic PAD.\nElectronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients with symptomatic PAD who underwent intervention (open, endovascular, or combined) between January 2000 and October 2004. All patients were previously screened for depression, and treatment was initiated as indicated by the primary care physician or psychiatrist. Demographic data and outcomes were recorded using published guidelines. Outcomes of interest included primary patency of the revascularization (bypass graft or angioplasty/stented artery), assisted primary patency, secondary patency, recurrent symptomatic ipsilateral PAD, and major amputation. Follow-up was available for all patients (mean, 23.4 +/- 14.1 months).\nBoard-certified vascular surgeons performed all interventions. At the time of intervention, 78 (36.1%) of 216 patients had been diagnosed with depression. Compared with those without depression, depressed patients were younger (64.4 vs 69.1 years; P = .001), currently using tobacco (74.4% vs 51.4%; P = .001), and less likely to have hypertension (79.5% vs 89.9%; P = .03). No other significant differences were noted for cardiovascular risk factors or prevalent comorbidities. During follow-up, 50 patients (23.1%) had failing or failed revascularizations, and 24 (11%) had amputations. Those with depression at the time of the PAD intervention, compared at 24 months with patients without depression, had significantly worse primary patency (58.2% vs 79.8%; P = .02), primary assisted patency (59.5% vs 81.5%; P = .01), and secondary patency (60.2% vs 82.2%; P = .007). They also had a significantly increased risk of recurrent symptomatic PAD (33.7% vs 20.8%; P = .03) but not major amputation (13.8% vs 10.4%; P = .73). By multivariate analysis, patients with depression were at significantly increased risk for recurrent symptomatic PAD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 3.02; P = .04) and failure of revascularization (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.22 to 3.88; P < .01), but not major amputation.\nDepression is common among patients undergoing intervention for symptomatic PAD. After intervention, patients with depression have worse outcomes for the affected leg. Prospective analysis is required to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "With the increased availability of lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), the conventional, non-interventional management of claudication may be evolving. This study evaluated changes in the use and short-term outcomes of PTA among patients with claudication and other manifestations of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted using the linked Washington State hospital discharge database (CHARS). Cases included all patients undergoing inpatient lower extremity PTA from 1997 to 2004. Patients with claudication were compared with those having PTA for other lower extremity diagnoses. The main outcome measures were readmission, reintervention (angiography, angioplasty/stent, surgical revascularization, or amputation), and death </=30 days.\nA total of 1718 patients (mean age 69.7 +/- 11.2, 52.4% male) underwent PTA for claudication (51.9%), rest pain (12.1%), ulceration (23.2%), or not otherwise specified (12.9%). Yearly PTA use nearly doubled between 1997 and 2004, from 182 to 360, with a more dramatic increase in PTA among patients with claudication. Patients undergoing PTA for claudication were younger (67.9 +/- 10.3 vs 71.7 +/- 11.7 years, P < .01), more likely male (58.2% vs 46.2%, P < .01), and had a lower comorbidity index (0.7 vs 1.1, P < .01) compared with all others. A total of 65.3% were Medicare eligible. Among 555 patients aged <65 years, the indication for PTA was claudication more often when they had private insurance compared with uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries (70.3% vs 49.1%, P < .01). Patients with claudication had shorter hospitalizations (2.4 +/- 2.3 vs 5.2 +/- 5.8 days, P < .01), lower rates of in-hospital death (0.8% vs 3.3%, P < .01), 30-day mortality (1.2% vs 4.7%, P < .01), and 30-day readmission (10% vs 23.1%, P < .05). Reintervention was required in 28.1% of readmitted patients with claudication, but none underwent amputation </=30 days.\nThe use of PTA for claudication dramatically increased during the 8-year study period. Claudication was more often the diagnosis for PTA in patients who were younger, healthier, and privately insured. PTA for claudication had a higher-than-expected morbidity, 30-day readmission, and rate of reintervention. Future studies should focus on the factors motivating the use of PTA, its associated outcomes, and global impact on patients and the health care system.",

    "abstract": "Many authors report inferior patency rates of distal arteriovenous fistulas in elderly patients and others present contradictory results. A meta-analysis of available evidence was performed to assess (1) whether non-elderly adults have the same risk of forearm arteriovenous fistula failure as elderly patients with end-stage renal disease and (2) whether such a distal access has the same risk of failure as more proximal access procedures or grafts in elderly patients.\nA literature search was performed using the MEDLINE and SCOPUS electronic databases. The analysis involved studies that comprised subgroups of elderly patients and compared their outcomes with those of non-elderly adults. Articles comparing patency rates of radial-cephalic and proximal fistulas or grafts in elderly patients were also included. Thirteen relevant studies (all cohort observational studies, 11 retrospective) were identified and included in the final analysis.\nThe meta-analysis revealed a statistically significantly higher rate of radial-cephalic arteriovenous fistula failure in elderly patients compared with non-elderly adults at 12 (odds ratio [OR], 1.525; P = .001) and 24 months (OR, 1.357, P = .019). The primary radial-cephalic arteriovenous fistula failure rate was also in favor of the non-elderly adults (OR, 1.79; P = .012). Secondary analysis revealed a pooled effect in favor of the elbow brachiocephalic fistulas that was statistically significant (P = .004) compared with distal fistulas in elderly patients.\nThis meta-analysis found an increased risk of radial-cephalic fistula failure in elderly patients and significant benefit from the creation of proximal autologous brachiocephalic fistulas. If confirmed by further prospective studies, these differences should be considered when planning a vascular access in incident elderly patients.",

This was successful with absence of pressure in the sac after the procedure and stable aneurysm size over the next nine months. Surveillance of the patient with both CT and ultrasound then revealed an increase in the aortic sac diameter in the absence of endoleak. A Cook Zenith converter was used to reline this PTFE endograft. Subsequently, imaging showed aneurysm sac shrinkage. This is a report of endotension with aneurysm expansion following Gore Excluder placement which was treated successfully with a dacron endograft.",

Reported operative mortality and operative complication rates seem low, with an infrequent need for surgical revision, even though most reports concern occlusive disease.

We report a case of thoracic stent-graft bulging rupture, a device previously implanted to exclude a thoracic aneurysm, associated with two small aneurysms near the distal implantation site.

    "abstract": "We describe open exposure of the inferior gluteal artery to allow coil embolization on an enlarging internal iliac artery aneurysm after previous abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. An 84-year-old man with a stoma had undergone open AAA repair surgery 8 years previously, during which the proximal aortic neck and both proximal external iliac arteries were ligated, followed by an aorta to right external iliac and left common femoral bypass. Eight years later, he complained of abdominal pain, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed persistent flow in the right internal iliac artery with enlargement to 8 cm in diameter. Because prograde access to the internal iliac artery was not possible as a result of the previous exclusion, the inferior gluteal artery was exposed surgically. Coil embolization of the arteries supplying the internal iliac artery aneurysm was successfully performed. The AAA and internal iliac artery aneurysm were treated by the exclusion technique. Eight years after the operation, CT revealed that the iliac artery had expanded to approximately 8 cm in diameter. The patient was placed face down, and a catheter was directly inserted into the internal iliac artery from the inferior gluteal artery. Four embolization coils were placed in the internal iliac artery and its branches. Absence of blood flow and shrinkage of the aneurysm were subsequently confirmed in the aneurysm, as shown by echogram color duplex scanning and CT scanning at 1 year. This technique could also be applicable for persistent blood flow in an internal iliac aneurysm after endovascular AAA repair, and the size of the aneurysm was reduced to approximately 1 cm 1 year after the operation.",

    "abstract": "Varicose veins are a common disorder of extensive venous dilation and remodeling with an as-yet unclear mechanism. Studies have shown increased plasma and tissue levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human varicose veins and animal models of venous hypertension. Although the effects of MMPs are generally attributed to extracellular matrix degradation, their effects on the mechanisms of venous contraction/relaxation are unclear. Our preliminary experiments have demonstrated that MMP-2 causes inhibition of phenylephrine-induced venous contraction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MMP-induced inhibition of venous contraction involves an endothelium-dependent and/or -independent pathway.\nCircular segments of the inferior vena cava (IVC) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and suspended between two wire hooks in a tissue bath, and the effects of MMP-2 on phenylephrine- and KCl-induced contraction were measured. To study the role of endothelium-derived vasodilators, experiments were performed in the presence and absence of endothelium; N(G)-l-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis; indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostacyclin synthesis; cromakalim, an activator of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP)); and iberiotoxin, a blocker of large-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (BK(Ca)) and smooth muscle hyperpolarization.\nIn endothelium-intact IVC segments, phenylephrine (10(-5) mol/L) caused significant contraction that slowly declined to 82.0% in 30 minutes. The addition of MMP-2 (1 microg/mL) caused a gradual decrease of phenylephrine contraction to 39.5% at 30 minutes. In endothelium-denuded IVC, MMP-2 induced a greater reduction of phenylephrine contraction, to 7.6%. In the presence of L-NAME (10(-4) mol/L), MMP-2 caused a marked decrease in phenylephrine contraction, to 4.4%. Large MMP-2-induced inhibition of phenylephrine contraction was also observed in IVC treated with L-NAME plus indomethacin. MMP-2 caused relaxation of phenylephrine contraction in IVC pretreated with cromakalim (10(-7) mol/L), an activator of K(ATP) channels. MMP-2-induced inhibition of phenylephrine contraction was abrogated in the presence of iberiotoxin (10(-8) mol/L), a blocker of BK(Ca). MMP-2 did not inhibit venous contraction during membrane depolarization by 96 mmol/L KCl, a condition that prevents outward K+ conductance and cell hyperpolarization.\nMMP-2 causes significant IVC relaxation that is potentiated in the absence of endothelium or during blockade of endothelium-mediated nitric oxide and prostacyclin synthesis. The lack of effects of MMP-2 on KCl contraction and in iberiotoxin-treated veins suggests MMP-2-induced smooth muscle hyperpolarization and activation of BK(Ca) channels--a novel effect of MMP that may play a role in the early stages of venous dilation and varicose vein formation.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic carotid plaques are characterized by reduced fibrous tissue content, increased lipid content, intraplaque hemorrhage, and cap rupture. This confers an increased stroke risk. Plaque remodelling reduces this risk, however, and this study has evaluated differences in echomorphology at varying times after a neurologic event.\nGray scale medians (GSM +/- interquartile ranges) were measured using the best single longitudinal (SLV) and multiple cross-sectional views (MCSV; transverse views, 5-mm intervals throughout plaque) on B-mode ultrasound images of 61 carotid plaques (70% to 99%) causing symptoms < or =30 (n = 20), 31 to 90 (n = 10), 91 to 180 (n = 16), or >180 days (n = 15). The results were compared with those in 47 asymptomatic plaques. Plaque echolucency (SLV-GSM, MCSV(min)-GSM [cross-sectional image with lowest GSM]) and heterogeneity (MCSV(max-min)-GSM [highest minus lowest GSM of cross-sectional views]) were determined.\nIn symptomatic plaques, echolucency was maximal < or =30 days of the presenting neurologic event (SLV-GSM, P = .009; MCSV(min)-GSM, P = .004). Although this diminished between 31 to 90 days, MCSV measurements in particular suggested increased echolucency (P = .042 at >180 days) and continuing heterogeneity (P = .01 at 91 to 180 days) beyond that time.\nPlaque echolucency was maximal < or =30 days of a neurologic event but diminished after 1 to 3 months, suggesting remodelling of unstable plaques. Continued features of increased echolucency and heterogeneity >91 days, however, suggests an increased stroke risk in these patients compared with that of the general population.",

    "abstract": "Renal insufficiency continues to be a complication that can affect patients after treatment for suprarenal aneurysms and renal artery occlusive disease. To our knowledge, no data are available showing that suprarenal aortic clamping and reperfusion (SRACR) above the renal arteries (renal-SRACR) preserves renal function compared with SRACR above the superior mesenteric artery (SMA-SRACR). This study examined the hypothesis that SMA-SRACR-induced downregulation of renal blood flow and function is more severe than renal-SRACR owing to the addition of systemic oxygen-derived free radical (ODFR) release.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (about 350 g) were anesthetized and microdialysis probes or laser Doppler fibers were inserted into the renal cortex (depth of 2 mm) and into the renal medulla (depth of 4 mm). Laser Doppler blood flow was continuously monitored, and the microdialysis probes were connected to a syringe pump and perfused in vivo at 3 microL/min with lactated Ringer's solution.\nSMA-SRACR and Renal-SRACR decreased medullary and cortical blood flow and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. SMA-SRACR downregulated cortical inducible NO synthase, whereas renal-SRACR did not. The cortex and medulla responded to the decreased blood flow and NO synthesis by increasing in prostaglandin E2 synthesis, which was due to increased cyclooxygenase-2 content. Superoxide dismutase restored SMA-SRACR (but not renal-SRACR) cortical and medullary NO synthesis, suggesting that ODFRs generated during mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion were one of the systemic mechanisms contributing to decreased renal NO synthesis in the SMA-SRACR model. The 90% decrease in creatinine clearance after SMA-SRACR was greater than the 60% decrease after renal-SRACR.\nThese data show that NO is important in maintaining renal cortical and medullary blood flow and NO synthesis after renal and SMA-SRACR. These data also suggest that in addition to the renal ischemia-reperfusion caused by both models, SMA SRACR induces mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in the generation of ODFRs, which contribute to decreased renal cortical and medullary NO synthesis. Maintaining splanchnic blood flow or attempting to keep SRACR below the SMA level may be helpful in developing strategies to minimize the renal injury after SRACR.",

    "abstract": "Circulating plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations are elevated in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) compared with controls. In vitro studies suggest that the aneurysm is the source of the IL-6. Because IL-6 is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, elevation of this cytokine may be significant in these patients, who represent a group at increased risk from cardiovascular death. The aim of this study was to directly measure in vivo aortic IL-6 concentrations, testing the hypothesis that aneurysms secrete IL-6 into the circulation.\nBefore endovascular aneurysm repair took place, blood was sampled from the entire length of the aorta in 27 patients with AAA and nine with thoracic aneurysms (TAs). A control group consisted of 15 patients without aneurysms undergoing angiography. Plasma IL-6 was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured turbidimetrically. Aneurysm surface area was calculated from axial computed tomography scans.\nMean IL-6 concentrations (pg/mL) were higher in the TA and AAA groups compared with controls (10.4 +/- 3.7 and 4.9 +/- 0.5 vs 2.7 +/- 0.5, P = .002). There was a significant difference in plasma IL-6 concentration corresponding to aneurysm position in the AAA (P = .002) and TA (P = .008) groups, with both patterns conforming to a linear trend. This pattern was not observed in the control group, in which no significant difference in IL-6 concentrations was found throughout the aorta. Peak IL-6 occurred earlier in TAs compared with AAAs (descending aorta vs iliac artery) corresponding to aneurysm position (P = .0007). Linear regression revealed a positive correlation between aneurysm surface area and mean plasma IL-6 (Spearman's correlation, P = .003). The mean surface areas of the TAs, at 0.07 m2 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.06 to 0.09), were higher than those of the AAAs at 0.03 m2 (IQR, 0.02 to 0.04; P = .002). High-sensitivity CRP was within normal limits, and no significant differences were found between the AAA group and the controls.\nCirculating IL-6 is elevated within the aorta in patients with aneurysms and corresponds to aneurysm position. Furthermore, aneurysm surface area and mean plasma IL-6 are correlated. In the absence of any evidence of systemic inflammation in the form of elevated hs-CRP, these data support the hypothesis that aneurysms secrete IL-6 into the circulation. This may contribute to the high cardiovascular mortality observed in patients with aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Although there is growing evidence that practice on bench model simulators can improve the acquisition of technical skill in surgery, the degree to which these models have to approximate real-world conditions (model fidelity) to optimize learning is unclear. Previous research suggests that low-fidelity models may be adequate for novice learners. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of model fidelity and surgical expertise on the acquisition of vascular anastomosis skill.\nTwenty-seven surgical residents participated in this institutional review board-approved study. Junior residents (postgraduate year 1 and 2) and senior residents (postgraduate year 4 or higher) were randomized into two groups: low-fidelity (n = 13) and high-fidelity (n = 14) model training. Both groups were given a 3-hour hands-on training session: the low-fidelity group used plastic models, and the high-fidelity group used human cadaver arms (brachial arteries) to practice graft-to-arterial anastomosis. One week later, all subjects participated in an animal laboratory in which they performed a single vascular anastomosis on a live, anesthetized pig (femoral artery). A blinded vascular surgeon scored candidate performance in the animal laboratory by using previously validated end points, including a checklist and final product analysis score.\nAcquisition of skill was significantly affected by model fidelity and level of training as measured by both the checklist (P = .03) and final product analysis (P = .01; Kruskal-Wallis). Specifically, junior residents practicing on high-fidelity models scored better on the checklist (P = .05) and final product analysis (P = .04). Senior residents practicing on high-fidelity models scored better on final product analysis (P < .05).\nTraining in the laboratory does improve skill when assessed in a realistic setting. Both expertise groups showed better skill transfer from the bench model to live animals when practicing on high-fidelity models. For vascular anastomosis, it is important to provide appropriate model fidelity for trainees of different abilities to optimize the effectiveness of bench model training.",

    "abstract": "Although common risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are well known, little data exist concerning the clinical impact of VTE in postoperative patients outside of controlled studies. This study evaluated prospective perioperative demographic and clinical variables associated with occurrence of postoperative symptomatic VTE.\nDemographic and clinical data were collected on surgical patients undergoing nine common general, vascular, and orthopedic operations presenting to the Veterans Health Administration Hospitals between 1996 and 2001 as part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). The association between covariates and the incidence of postoperative symptomatic VTE (includes deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) was assessed using bivariable and multivariable regression.\nComplete demographic and clinical information for analysis were available for 75,771 patients. The mean patient age was 65 years, and 96.6% were men. Major comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (DM), 25%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 18.3%; and congestive heart failure (CHF), 3.9%. Symptomatic VTE was diagnosed in 805 patients (0.68%), varied significantly with procedure (0.14% for carotid endarterectomy vs 1.34% for total hip arthroplasty), and was associated with increased 30-day mortality (16.9% vs 4.4%, P < .0001). The incidence of VTE did not decline substantially between 1996 and 2001 (0.72% vs 0.68%). Preoperative factors associated with symptomatic VTE were older age, male gender, corticosteroid use, COPD, recent weight loss, disseminated cancer, low albumin, and low hematocrit (all P < .01) but not DM. Postoperative factors associated with VTE were myocardial infarction (MI), blood transfusion (>4 units), coma, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI), whereas those with hemodialysis-dependent renal failure were less likely to experience VTE (all P < .01). In multivariable analysis, adjusting for age and the variables significant by bivariable analysis, the strongest positive predictors of symptomatic VTE included UTI (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.5), acute renal insufficiency (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.2), postoperative transfusion (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.7), perioperative MI (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.9), and pneumonia (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.5). In contrast, hemodialysis (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.71), DM (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93), and higher preoperative albumin levels (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.96, per mg/dL change) were protective from symptomatic VTE.\nAlthough the overall incidence of symptomatic VTE is low in surgical patients, it is associated with significantly increased 30-day mortality. In addition to previously recognized risk factors, patients who have postoperative complications of an infectious nature, bleeding, or MI are at particular risk.",

    "abstract": "Reviewed are the results of the emergent treatment of effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein. The protocol calls for immediate thrombolysis, followed by surgery at the time of the acute event. The one-stage procedure includes decompression of the thoracic inlet by subclavicular removal of the first rib, subclavius muscle, scalenectomy, and vein patch plasty of the stenotic segment of the vein.\nBetween July 1985 through June 2006, 114 patients presented with Paget-Schroetter syndrome (effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein), 97 of which (group I) were seen < or =2 weeks of onset of symptoms. They underwent an emergent protocol treatment in which thrombolysis is immediately followed by surgery at the time of the acute event. In addition, another 17 patients (group II) were referred to our institution after being treated elsewhere with initial thrombolysis, but with surgery deferred a mean 34 days (range, 2 weeks to 3 months) after the initial event. All patients underwent the same lytic and surgical protocol. Operability was determined by the findings on the venogram. Routine postoperative anticoagulation for 8 weeks was implemented with warfarin and clopidogrel.\nThere was 100% success in re-establishing the flow and normal caliber of the subclavian vein in the 97 patients in group I. Seven patients showed some residual stenosis that required balloon plasty and implant of a stent. Postoperative duplex ultrasound imaging documented patency in all 97 patients (100%). The 17 patients with delayed surgery (group II) showed progression of the fibrosis, with vein obstruction in 12 (70%). Only five patients (29%) were operable with successful results. The remaining 12 patients were inoperable owing to extensive fibrosis and occlusion of the inflow, and all 12 have remained disabled for the use of their arm.\nThe emergent approach to treat Paget-Schroetter syndrome seems to render the optimal results, with 100% effectiveness in re-establishing venous flow and normal caliber to the vessel. When properly conducted, this operation avoids the use of stents or balloon plasty with excellent long-term results, leaving the patients unrestricted for physical activities.",

    "abstract": "Several studies report a higher prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in women and among blacks. These studies based their PAD definition on an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.90. We hypothesized that there is an inherent contribution of gender and ethnicity to normal ABI values, independent of biologic and social disparities that exist between gender and ethnic groups. Consequently, an ABI threshold that disregards these fundamental gender-related and ethnicity-related differences could partly contribute to reported prevalence differences.\nA cross-sectional study was designed as part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a multicenter United States population study. We selected a subgroup of participants with unequivocally normal ABIs (1.00 to 1.30), and additionally excluded participants with any major PAD risk factor (smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension). In a linear model with ABI as the dependent variable, demographic, clinical, biologic, and social variables were introduced as independent factors.\nAmong 1775 healthy participants, there was no association between ABI level and subclinical cardiovascular disease (coronary calcium or carotid plaque). Male gender, weight, and high education level were positively correlated with ABI, whereas black race, triglycerides, pack-years (in past smokers), and pulse pressure were negatively correlated. In the fully adjusted model, women had about 0.02 lower ABI values than men, and blacks showed ABI values about 0.02 lower than non-Hispanic whites.\nThese data suggest intrinsic ethnic and gender differences in ABI. Such differences, although small in magnitude, are highly significant and can distort population estimates of disease burden.",

Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) at the buttock level was used to evaluate blood flow impairment during exercise at the proximal level, with blood flow impairment defined as buttock minus chest TcPO2 decrease in excess of -15 mm Hg.\nThirty patients reported proximal exercise-related pain consistent with vascular criteria by history before exercise. However, 59 patients (56%) reported symptoms compatible with proximal claudication, and TcPO2 values were abnormal on one or both sides in 52. The persistence of at least one (prograde or retrograde) pathway to the hypogastric circulation, determined by review of operative details from the aortobifemoral bypass and angiography, did not significantly decrease the proportion of patients reporting proximal claudication by history (26%) or on treadmill (55%) compared with those with bilateral hypogastric occlusion (33% by history, P = .51 compared with at least one prograde hypogastric pathway and 61% based on treadmill test, P = .65 compared with at least one prograde hypogastric pathway).\nThe present study shows that (1) the proportion of ABF patients with a median bypass age of 2 years that report proximal claudication is high (28%), (2) this proportion is significantly higher when claudication is detected by treadmill exercise tests, (3) a vascular origin (or at least contribution) is likely 88% of the proximal symptoms observed on treadmill, (4) the presence of proximal claudication with associated abnormal TcPO(2) results increases the risk of walking impairment in affected patients, and (5) preservation of at least one internal iliac artery to allow prograde or retrograde flow to the hypogastric vascular bed does not decrease the risk of proximal claudication after ABF surgery. A vascular origin of (or at least contribution to) most of the proximal exercise-related symptoms should always be discussed in patients with patent ABF bypass.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), although not the traditional therapy, seems to be a safe alternative for patients with critical limb ischemia who are believed to be unsuitable candidates for open surgery. However, the efficacy of PTA in this setting has not been analyzed. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of PTA for limb salvage with outcomes of major limb amputation in physiologically impaired patients believed to be unsuitable for open surgery.\nFrom a prospective vascular registry, 314 patients (183 underwent amputation, and 131 underwent complex PTA for limb salvage) were identified as physiologically impaired or unsuitable for open surgery. This was defined as having at least one of the following: functional impairment (homebound ambulatory or transfer only), mental impairment (dementia), or medical impairment (two of the following: end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Patients undergoing PTA were compared with patients undergoing amputation by examining the outcome parameters of survival, maintenance of ambulation, and maintenance of independent living status. Parameters were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier life-table curves (log-rank test and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) and hazard ratios (HRs) from the Cox model.\nPTA resulted in a 12-month limb salvage rate of 63%. Thirty-day mortality was 4.4% for the amputation group and 3.8% for the PTA group. After adjustment for age, race, diabetes, prior vascular procedure, dementia, and baseline functional status, PTA patients had significantly lower rates of ambulation failure (HR, 0.44; P = .0002) and loss of independence (HR, 0.53; P = .025) but had significantly higher mortality (HR, 1.62; P = .006) than amputees. However, when life tables were examined, the maintenance of ambulation advantage lasted only 12 months (PTA, 68.6%; 95% CI, 59.6%-77.7%; amputation, 48%; 95% CI, 40.4%-55.5%) and was not statistically significant at 2 years (62.2% [95% CI, 48.8%-71.5%] and 44% [95% CI, 35.8%-52.2%], respectively). Maintenance of independent living status advantage lasted only 3 months, with no statistically significant difference at 2 years (PTA, 60.5%; 95% CI, 45.4%-75.6%; amputation, 52.6%; 95% CI, 40.4%-64.9%). Although mortality was high in both cohorts, patients who underwent amputation had a survival advantage for all time intervals examined (at 2 years: PTA, 29%; 95% CI, 19.9%-38.1%; amputation, 48.1%; 95% CI, 39.2%-56.9%).\nPatients who present with critical limb ischemia and physiologic impairments that preclude open surgery seem to have comorbidities that blunt any functional advantage achieved after PTA for limb salvage. PTA in this setting affords very little benefit compared with amputation alone.",

    "abstract": "Patients who present for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have worse postoperative outcomes than patients with asymptomatic carotid disease. We undertook this study to see whether preoperative medication use or patient characteristics were associated with the presence of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease at the time of operation.\nA retrospective case-control study was performed among patients presenting for elective CEA at a single academic institution between 1994 and 2004. A total of 660 (42%) symptomatic patients were identified from an institutional database and compared with 901 (58%) control patients who were asymptomatic at the time of CEA. The independent association of cerebrovascular symptoms with patient variables was assessed by using multivariate logistic regression analysis after propensity score adjustment.\nThe mean age and sex distribution were similar between cases and controls, although symptomatic patients were more likely to have an ulcerative plaque (18% symptomatic vs 11% asymptomatic; P < .01). Compared with asymptomatic controls, patients presenting for CEA with symptoms of stroke or TIA were less likely to have hyperlipidemia (43% vs 55%; P < .01) or a history of coronary artery disease (43% vs 54%; P < .01) and were less likely to be receiving statins (35% vs 47%; P < .01), beta-blockers (34% vs 44%; P < .01), and diuretics (22% vs 31%; P < .01). After controlling for potential interaction and confounding by using propensity score adjustment and logistic regression analysis, preoperative use of statins (adjusted odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.92; P = .01) and diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.95; P = .02) were independently associated with a lower likelihood of having cerebrovascular symptoms at the time of CEA.\nWe observed that patients receiving statins or diuretics were less likely to present for CEA with symptoms of stroke or TIA. These data raise the question of whether the preoperative use of these medications protects patients with carotid stenosis from developing symptomatic disease and contributes to improved outcomes among patients undergoing CEA. Further research is needed to assess the optimal medical management of patients before vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy to prevent a stroke is less beneficial for women compared with men. This benefit is lower in asymptomatic women compared with asymptomatic men or symptomatic patients. A possible explanation for this gender-associated difference in outcome could be found in the atherosclerotic carotid plaque phenotype. We hypothesize that women, especially asymptomatic women, have more stable plaques than men, resulting in a decreased benefit of surgical plaque removal.\nCarotid endarterectomy specimens of 450 consecutive patients (135 women, 315 men) were studied. The culprit lesions were semi-quantitatively analyzed for the presence of macrophages, smooth muscle cells, collagen, calcifications, and luminal thrombus. Plaques were categorized in three phenotypes according to overall presentation and the amount of fat. Protein was isolated from the plaques for determination of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 concentrations and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) and MMP-9 activities.\nAtheromatous plaques (>40% fat) were less frequently observed in women than in men (22% vs 40%; P < .001). In addition, plaques obtained from women more frequently revealed low macrophage staining (11% vs 18%; P = .05) and strong smooth muscle cell staining (38% vs 24%; P = .001). Compared with men, women had a lower plaque concentration of IL-8 (P = .001) and lower MMP-8 activity (P = .01). The observed differences were most pronounced in asymptomatic women, who showed the most stable plaques, with an atheromatous plaque in only 9% of cases compared with 39% in asymptomatic men (P = .02). In addition, a large proportion of plaques obtained from asymptomatic women showed high smooth muscle cell content (53% vs 30%; P = .03) and high collagen content (55% vs 24%; P = .003). All relations between gender and plaque characteristics, except for MMP-8, remained intact in a multivariate analysis, including clinical presentation and other cardiovascular risk factors.\nCarotid artery plaques obtained from women have a more stable, less inflammatory phenotype compared with men, independent of clinical presentation and cardiovascular risk profile. Asymptomatic women demonstrate the highest prevalence of stable plaques. These findings could explain why women benefit less from carotid endarterectomy compared with men.",

    "abstract": "Determining renal resistive index (RI) in the setting of renal artery stenosis may predict which patients benefit from revascularization. Renal duplex ultrasonography (RDUS) is the traditional method of assessing RI, but it is not available in most invasive endovascular laboratories. Conversely, endovascular techniques to assess RI are available but not well validated. The primary goal was to determine if an invasive approach using an endovascular Doppler flow wire correlates with RI assessment using traditional noninvasive RDUS.\nIn a single-center prospective trial, patients were enrolled if they had known or suspected renovascular disease. A Doppler flow wire was placed in multiple segments of the renal artery, and peak (PSV) and end-diastolic velocities (EDV) were measured. RI was calculated using the formula: RI = [1 - (EDV/PSV)] x 100. Similarly, RI was also derived using standard RDUS. All patients underwent both RI techniques before any revascularization procedure. Secondary end points included assessing the correlation for pole-to-pole renal length assessment and PSV and EDV velocities using both invasive and noninvasive techniques. Pearson correlation coefficient calculations were used to determine degree of correlation.\nThe study enrolled 20 patients, and 35 renal arteries were studied. Overall, Pearson correlation coefficient for invasive vs noninvasive RI assessment was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.93). The r values were 0.43 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.67) for pole-to-pole renal length, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.76) for PSV, and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.72) for EDV determination. No major complications occurred during this study. Average time to perform invasive Doppler assessment was 10.4 +/- 7.4 minutes per artery.\nInvasive RI assessment using an endovascular flow wire technique correlates well with traditional noninvasive RDUS. A moderate statistical correlation also exists for pole-to-pole renal length, PSV, and EDV determinations. The procedure is safe and can be performed rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Visceral artery aneurysms may be treated by aneurysm exclusion, excision, revascularization, and endovascular techniques. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of the management of visceral artery aneurysms with catheter-based techniques.\nBetween 1997 and 2005, 90 patients were identified with a diagnosis of visceral artery aneurysm. This was inclusive of aneurysmal disease of the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), inferior mesenteric artery, and their branches. Surveillance without intervention occurred in 23 patients, and 19 patients underwent open aneurysm repair (4 ruptures). The endovascular treatment of 48 consecutive patients (mean age 58, 60% men) with 20 visceral artery aneurysms (VAA) and 28 visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPA) was the basis for this study. Electronic and hardcopy medical records were reviewed for demographic data and clinical variables. Original computed tomography (CT) scans and fluoroscopic imaging were evaluated.\nThe endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms was technically successful in 98% of 48 procedures, consisting of 3 celiac axis repairs, 2 left gastric arteries, 1 SMA, 12 hepatic arteries, 20 splenic arteries, 7 gastroduodenal arteries, 1 middle colic artery, and 2 pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Of these, 29 (60%) were performed for symptomatic disease (5 ruptured aneurysms). Procedures were performed in the endovascular suite under local anesthesia with conscious sedation (94%). The femoral artery was used as the preferential access site (90%). Coil embolization was used for aneurysm exclusion in 96%. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (glue) was used selectively (19%) using a triaxial system with a 3F microcatheter for persistent flow or multiple branches. The 30-day mortality was 8.3% (n = 4). One patient died from recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding after gastroduodenal embolization, and the remaining died of unrelated causes. All perioperative deaths occurred in patients requiring urgent or emergent intervention in the setting of hemodynamic instability. No patients undergoing elective intervention died in the periprocedural period. Postprocedural imaging was performed after 77% of interventions at a mean of 16 months. Complete exclusion of flow within the aneurysm sac occurred in 97% interventions with follow-up imaging, but coil and glue artifact complicated CT evaluation. Postembolization syndrome developed in three patients (6%) after splenic artery embolization. There was no evidence of hepatic insufficiency or bowel ischemia after either hepatic or mesenteric artery aneurysm treatment. Three patients required secondary interventions for persistent flow (n = 1) and recurrent bleeding from previously embolized aneurysms (n = 2).\nVisceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms can be successfully treated with endovascular means with low periprocedural morbidity; however, the urgent repair of these lesions is still associated with elevated mortality rates. Aneurysm exclusion can be accomplished with coil embolization and the selective use of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Current catheter-based techniques extend our ability to exclude visceral artery aneurysms, but imaging artifact hampers postoperative CT surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) caused by arterial occlusive disease requires prompt diagnosis and revascularization to avoid the high mortality associated with this disease. In an attempt to minimize the magnitude of operation for arterial occlusive AMI, we have developed a new technique of endovascular recanalization and open retrograde stenting of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) during laparotomy so that the bowel can also be assessed and resected if necessary.\nAll emergent mesenteric revascularizations for arterial occlusive AMI performed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center from 2001 to 2005 (n = 13) were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes were analyzed with respect to the method of revascularization and other perioperative variables. Restenosis was evaluated with duplex ultrasound imaging.\nThree different revascularization methods were used: surgical bypass (n = 5), antegrade percutaneous stenting (n = 2), and retrograde open mesenteric (SMA) stenting (ROMS, n = 6). Satisfactory revascularization was achieved in all cases and all methods. ROMS was successfully accomplished in three of six patients after antegrade attempts to cross the SMA from the arm were unsuccessful. At 17%, the ROMS group had the lowest hospital mortality compared with bypass at 80% (P = .08) and percutaneous stent at 100% (P = .11). All five of the surviving patients treated with ROMS were discharged to home after a mean hospital stay of 20 days (range, 6 to 38 days). During a mean follow-up of 13 +/- 7 months, three patients died of unrelated causes, of which two were being followed with asymptomatic recurrent SMA stenosis detected by duplex scan. The two surviving patients are alive and well, but one has required percutaneous SMA stenting of a progressive asymptomatic restenosis.\nRetrograde open SMA stenting during laparotomy for AMI has a high technical success rate and provides an attractive alternative to surgical bypass in these often critically ill patients. Because it is combined with open laparotomy, it honors the essential surgical principles of evaluating and resecting nonviable bowel. Restenosis rates appear to be high, so that patients must be followed closely. Further study and development of this new hybrid technique is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Integrity of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) neck is crucial for the long-term success of endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). However, suitable tools for reliable assessment of changes in small aortic volumes are lacking. The purpose of this study was to assess the intraobserver and interobserver variability of software-enhanced 64-row computed tomographic angiography (CTA) AAA neck volume measurements in patients after EVAR.\nA total of 25 consecutive patients successfully treated by EVAR underwent 64-row follow-up CTA in 1.5-mm collimation. Manual CTA measurements were performed twice by three blinded and independent readers in random order with at least a 4-week interval between readings. Maximum and minimum transverse aortic neck diameters were measured twice on two different levels within the proximal neck. Volumetry of the proximal aortic neck was performed by using dedicated software. Variability was calculated as 1.96 SD of the mean arithmetic difference according to Bland and Altman. Two-sided and paired t tests were used to compare measurements. P values <.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\nIntraobserver agreement was excellent for dedicated aneurysmal neck volumetry, with mean differences of less than 1 mL (P > .05), whereas it was poor for transverse aortic neck diameter measurements (P < .05). However, interobserver variability was statistically significant for both neck volumetry (P < .005) and neck diameter measurements (P < .015).\nThe reliability of dedicated AAA neck volumetry by using 64-row CTA is excellent for serial measurements by individual readers, but not between different readers. Therefore, studies should be performed with aortic neck volumetry by a single experienced reader.",

    "abstract": "The development of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as an alternative to open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has led to an increasing number of patients being treated by this less-invasive technique. It was anticipated that EVAR would reduce the operative mortality and morbidity compared with open repair. This study examined the initial 10-year experience in one center when both techniques were available to determine if there were advantages to one technique or the other, putting the results into the perspective of routine clinical care of patients with infrarenal AAA.\nFrom June 1996 to May 2005, 677 patients underwent elective repair of their infrarenal AAA, of which 417 were treated with open repair and 260 by EVAR. Demographic and aneurysm-specific data, comorbidities, operative morbidity, mortality, and late outcome were analyzed.\nOpen repair patients were 2 years younger (71 vs 74 years, P < .001), had larger aneurysms (6.01 +/- 1.38 cm vs 5.45 +/- 0.99 cm, P < .001), greater familial predisposition, a higher incidence of current smokers, and a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than the EVAR group. There were no differences in renal function, hypertension, coronary artery disease, or heart failure between the two groups. Overall operative mortality was 3.1%; operative mortality per group was 3.5% for open and 2.7% for EVAR (P = .627). Procedure-related outcomes showed significant differences in operative blood loss and length of hospital stay in favor of EVAR, and 95% of the EVAR patients were discharged home vs 83% in the open repair group (P < .001). A Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis showed no difference in early or long-term survival between open repair and EVAR (P = .20), but did show a difference in mid-term (3-year) survival favoring open repair (P < .002). Survival analysis by age (<70 and > or =70 years) showed no difference between treatment groups.\nOpen repair and EVAR are both performed safely in patients treated for elective infrarenal AAA. EVAR has the perioperative advantages of reduced blood loss, reduced length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, and increased number of patients discharged to home. The mid-term survival advantage of open repair has been observed in other reports and deserves further study.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the role of iliac fixation in preventing migration of suprarenal and infrarenal aortic endografts.\nQuantitative image analysis was performed in 92 patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms (76 men and 16 women) treated with suprarenal (n = 36) or infrarenal (n = 56) aortic endografts from 2000 to 2004. The longitudinal centerline distance from the superior mesenteric artery to the top of the stent graft was measured on preoperative, postimplantation, and 1-year three-dimensional computed tomographic scans, with movement more than 5 mm considered to be significant. Aortic diameters were measured perpendicular to the centerline axis. Proximal and distal fixation lengths were defined as the lengths of stent-graft apposition to the aortic neck and the common iliac arteries, respectively.\nThere were no significant differences in age, comorbidities, or preoperative aneurysm size (suprarenal, 6.0 cm; infrarenal, 5.7 cm) between the suprarenal and infrarenal groups. However, the suprarenal group had less favorable aortic necks with a shorter length (13 vs 25 mm; P < .0001), a larger diameter (27 vs 24 mm; P < .0001), and greater angulation (19 degrees vs 11 degrees ; P = .007) compared with the infrarenal group. The proximal aortic fixation length was greater in the suprarenal than in the infrarenal group (22 vs 16 mm; P < .0001), with the top of the device closer to the superior mesenteric artery (8 vs 21 mm; P < .0001) as a result of the 15-mm uncovered suprarenal stent. There was no difference in iliac fixation length between the suprarenal and infrarenal groups (26 vs 25 mm; P = .8). Longitudinal centerline stent graft movement at 1 year was similar in the suprarenal and infrarenal groups (4.3 +/- 4.4 mm vs 4.8 +/- 4.3 mm; P = .6). Patients with longitudinal centerline movement of more than 5 mm at 1 year or clinical evidence of migration at any time during the follow-up period comprised the respective migrator groups. Suprarenal migrators had a shorter iliac fixation length (17 vs 29 mm; P = .006) and a similar aortic fixation length (23 vs 22 mm; P > .999) compared with suprarenal nonmigrators. Infrarenal migrators had a shorter iliac fixation length (18 vs 30 mm; P < .0001) and a similar aortic fixation length (14 vs 17 mm; P = .1) compared with infrarenal nonmigrators. Nonmigrators had closer device proximity to the hypogastric arteries in both the suprarenal (7 vs 17 mm; P = .009) and infrarenal (8 vs 24 mm; P < .0001) groups. No migration occurred in either group in patients with good iliac fixation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that iliac fixation, as evidenced by iliac fixation length (P = .004) and the device to hypogastric artery distance (P = .002), was a significant independent predictor of migration, whereas suprarenal or infrarenal treatment was not a significant predictor of migration. During a clinical follow-up period of 45 +/- 22 months (range, 12-70 months), there have been no aneurysm ruptures, abdominal aortic aneurysm-related deaths, or surgical conversions in either group.\nDistal iliac fixation is important in preventing migration of both suprarenal and infrarenal aortic endografts that have longitudinal columnar support. Secure iliac fixation minimizes the risk of migration despite suboptimal proximal aortic neck anatomy. Extension of both iliac limbs to cover the entire common iliac artery to the iliac bifurcation seems to prevent endograft migration.",

    "abstract": "Because of concern about the percentage of enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) after endovascular repair with the Excluder device (W.L. Gore & Assoc, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif), the graft material was modified to reduce its permeability and released for commercial use in mid-2004. We studied all AAA repairs with Excluder endografts performed at our institution, including the original-permeability (OP) version (n = 99) and the low-permeability (LP) version (n = 48).\nAll patients were followed up with serial computed tomography (CT) angiography and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. Morphologic measurements, including AAA diameter and 3D volume, were prospectively entered into a database to evaluate changes in AAA size over time. Owing to the length of available follow-up for the LP version, the primary end point was AAA size change at 6 and 12 months, evaluated by Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.\nPreoperative and postoperative anatomy was similar in the two groups, including AAA diameter (OP, 5.6 +/- 1 cm; LP, 5.8 +/- 2 cm; P = .3), aortic neck length (OP, 21 +/- 1 mm; LP, 22 +/- 2 mm; P = .9), postoperative aortic seal zone (OP, 18 +/- 1 mm; LP, 16 +/- 1 mm, P > .1) and iliac seal zone (OP, 33 +/- 1 mm, LP 31 +/- 1 mm, P = .2). The rate of sac shrinkage differed significantly. Orthogonal diameter measurements showed a significant difference in the rate of shrinkage by 12 months postoperatively (OP, -2.1 +/- 1 mm; LP, -5.1 +/- 1 mm; P = .01). By 3D volume, the rate of shrinkage was considerably different between the two groups at both 6 and 12 months (12 months: OP, -6% +/- 1%; LP, -20 +/- 4%; P = .0006). There was no enlargement by diameter in either group at 6 or 12 months postoperative. By standard volume criteria, however, 12 of 99 patients in the OP group and one of 48 patients in the LP group had significant AAA enlargement < or =12 months (P = .04). Of these, four of 12 patients in the OP group had enlargement without apparent endoleak, even on delayed-contrast CT. The remainder had persistent type II endoleaks (8/12 in the OP group and 1/1 in the LP group). Multivariate analysis revealed graft permeability (P < .0001) and endoleak (P < .0001) as independent factors in aneurysm size change. In the OP group long-term, the average AAA enlarged at later time points compared with the prior scan: 24 months, -0.2%; 36 months, +0.2%; 48 months, +2%; and 60 months, +2% (P < .0002).\nIn early follow-up, the low-permeability Excluder device is associated with a significantly greater aneurysm shrinkage rate than the original version. Clinically important enlargement also appears significantly different within 1 year of implantation. Despite these promising results, longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these differences will persist.",

    "abstract": "Complete exclusion and depressurization of the aneurysm sac is the prime goal of endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Thus, any EVAR that results in a type I or III endoleak has been classified as a technical failure. The current method to detect endoleaks uses intraoperative aortography. However, aortography is limited by its subjective nature, inability to quantify the significance of the endoleak, and artifacts such as bowel gas that may mimic an endoleak. In addition, repetitive contrast injection may impair renal function. To increase the efficacy and safety of intraoperative endoleak detection, a wireless pressure-monitoring system has been developed and tested in the clinical setting.\nThe APEX trial (Acute Pressure Measurement to Confirm Aneurysm Sac EXclusion) is a prospective, multicenter/international trial sponsored by CardioMEMS to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EndoSure wireless pressure sensor for EVAR. The 30 x 5 x 1.5-mm sensor contains no battery and is powered externally with radiofrequency energy. The sensors are extremely stable, operate over the full physiologic range of pressures, and have a resolution of 1 mm Hg. A total of 90 patients were enrolled at 12 sites, 76 of whom were eligible for analysis. The sensor was implanted via the contralateral femoral artery at the time of EVAR. The sac pulse pressure was measured with both an angiographic catheter and the sensor after deployment of the main endograft but before the deployment of the contralateral limb (type I endoleak equivalent). Sac pressure was again measured with the sensor after deployment of the contralateral limb and completion of the EVAR. Data were collected in a prospective manner.\nIn all of the eligible patients (n = 76), the initial sensor pressure measurement agreed closely with the angiographic catheter pressure measurement of the type I endoleak equivalent. At the completion of the procedure, there was agreement between the sensor measurement and angiography regarding the presence or absence of a type I or III endoleak in 92.1% (n = 70) of the measurements. Overall, the sensitivity was 0.94 and the specificity was 0.80 for detecting type I or III endoleaks. Final pulse pressures decreased significantly compared with baseline measurements.\nImplantation of the wireless pressure sensor is safe, and remote aneurysm sac pressure sensing is feasible. It was a valuable guide in evaluating the completeness of the EVAR procedure. Long-term study will be needed to prove its efficacy for postoperative surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Recent results after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) have brought into question its value in patients deemed at high-risk for surgical intervention. The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) is the largest prospectively collected and validated United States surgical database representing current clinical practice. The purpose of our study was to evaluate outcomes after elective EVAR performed in high-risk veterans.\nUsing NSQIP data from 123 participating VA hospitals, we retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent elective aneurysm repair from May 2001 to December 2004. High-risk criteria were used to identify a cohort for analysis (EVAR, n = 788; open, n = 1580). High-risk criteria analyzed included age > or =60 years, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification 3 or 4, and the comorbidity variables of history of cardiac, respiratory, or hepatic disease, cardiac revascularization, renal insufficiency, and low serum albumin level. Our primary end points were 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality, and we evaluated a secondary end point of perioperative complications. Statistical analysis included univariate analysis and multivariate modeling.\nVeterans who were classified as high-risk underwent elective EVAR with significantly lower 30-day (3.4% vs 5.2%, P = .047) and 1-year all-cause mortality (9.5% vs 12.4%, P = .038) than patients having open repair. EVAR was associated with a decrease in 30-day postoperative mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 1.03; P = .067) as well as 1-year mortality (adjusted OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.91; P = .0094) despite the presence of severe comorbid conditions. The risk of perioperative complications was significantly lower after EVAR (16.2% vs 31.0%; P < .0001; adjusted OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.52; P < .0001). A subset analysis of higher-risk patients (ASA 4 and the above comorbidity variables) still demonstrated an acceptable 30-day mortality rate.\nIn veterans deemed high-risk for surgical therapy, outcomes after elective EVAR are excellent, and the procedure is relatively safe in this special patient population. Our retrospective data demonstrate that patients with considerable medical comorbidities and infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms benefit from and should be considered for primary EVAR.",

This study describes the diagnosis and treatment of six patients with partial axillary vein obstruction by the pectoralis minor muscle, a condition that can mimic subclavian vein obstruction.\nA chart review of patients undergoing pectoralis minor tenotomies (PMT) between 2004 and 2006 revealed six patients (3 men and 3 women), aged 17 to 39, who underwent seven PMT procedures for symptoms of arm swelling, cyanosis, and pain or tightness. Diagnosis was suggested by history and physical examination and was confirmed by dynamic venography. Patients with paresthesia suggesting associated neurogenic pectoralis minor compression were given a pectoralis minor muscle block. As an outpatient, PMT was initially performed with an infraclavicular approach but later through the transaxillary route. Follow-up was by phone interview in five patients and a physical examination in one.\nVenography demonstrated axillary vein compression under the pectoralis minor, which was more significant than the minor degree of subclavian vein compression seen on the same venogram. Follow-up was 1.5 years to 10 years in three patients and 3 months in the other three. All six patients experienced good-to-excellent relief of all symptoms. There were no surgical complications.\nAxillary venous obstruction by the pectoralis minor must be distinguished from subclavian vein obstruction, which presents with similar symptoms. PMT is a simple, risk-free, outpatient procedure that has produced uniformly good results.",

We have attempted to adapt the elastase-perfused animal model to determine whether tobacco exposure can lower the threshold of aortic injury necessary for AAA development.\nAdult C57BL/6 mice underwent transient perfusion of the infrarenal aorta with an active solution of elastase: high-dose (HDE, 0.19 U/mL, n=9), standard-dose (SDE, 0.16 U/mL, n=21) or low-dose (LDE, 0.07 U/mL, n=24). Control animals (n=24) were treated with heat inactivated elastase (HIE). Twenty LDE perfused mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (LDE-S) beginning 2 weeks before perfusion and continuing until aortic harvest. Aortic diameter (AD) was measured preperfusion, postperfusion, and at harvest on day 14. AAA was defined as %DeltaAD>or=100% between preperfusion and harvest. Aortas from each group (except HDE) were analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-12 expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.\nAll SDE mice developed large AAA by %DeltaAD (189.3%+/-16.9%, mean+/-standard error of the mean), but control mice had only a small dilatation (69.7%+/-3.7%, P<.01). Higher doses of elastase did not produce larger aneurysms in HDE mice. In contrast, only 63% of LDE mice showed aneurysmal dilatation, and these were significantly smaller (104.3%+/-4.2%, P<.01). When exposed to cigarette smoke, LDE animals developed significantly larger aneurysms (%DeltaAD, 134.5%+/-7.9%, P=.0021). There was no difference in normalized aortic MMP-9 and MMP-12 expression between elastase doses or between smoke-exposed and unexposed animals. Histologic analysis revealed that smoking increased the extent of aortic elastin degradation when compared with LDE-S animals.\nAneurysm development in the elastase model is dependent on the quantity of active elastase infused. Exposure of animals to tobacco smoke after a relatively minor aortic elastase injury produces increases in elastin degradation and aneurysm size without affecting MMP-9 or MMP-12 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in an animal model that smoking can act as a synergistic factor in AAA development. Further understanding of the relationship between smoking and AAA in this model may help unveil the pathophysiologic pathways involved between cigarette smoke and AAAs.",

At 5 years, corelab reported 0% limb narrowing, 0% trunk migration, 0% component (contralateral leg, aortic extender, and iliac extender) migration, 0% fracture, endoleak in 3% (2 type II/68), and aneurysm growth (>5 mm compared to baseline) in 38% (30/78) of the test group. There are no aneurysm ruptures in either test or control group.\nAfter 5 years follow-up, endovascular repair is a safer and effective treatment compared with open surgical repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Major adverse events are less frequent with the endograft despite the need for late reinterventions. Aneurysm expansion is observed in nearly two-fifths of patients but is not associated with endoleak or aneurysm rupture. Multicenter clinical trials are evaluating a newer version of this device designed to avoid this high rate of sac expansion.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous access during endovascular aneurysm repair has been difficult owing to the large size of the delivery catheters. This study reports a single-center experience of totally percutaneous access during endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic repairs using the Preclose Proglide device (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, Calif).\nBetween December 2004 and August 2006, 262 endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs were performed. Percutaneous access was used for the introduction of 12F to 24F sheaths (4.4-mm to 8.6-mm outer diameter). The technique involved deployment of two Proglide devices before insertion of the sheath (\"Preclose\" technique) with the sutures left extracorporeally for closure after conclusion of the procedure. A prospectively maintained endovascular database and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Rates of technical success, failure modes, and the overall duration of the endovascular repair compared with a similar cohort using open femoral exposures were examined.\nA total of 559 Proglide devices were used to close 279 femoral arteries, and 175 (63%) required the insertion of 18F to 24F sheaths. There were 16 failures, mainly due to obesity, device malfunction, severe calcific disease, and faulty arterial punctures, for a technical success rate of 94.3%. The success rates for 12F to 16F size sheaths were significantly higher than for the larger 18F to 24F sheaths (99.0% vs 91.4%, P<.01). For both endovascular abdominal (EVAR) and thoracic (TEVAR) aortic repairs, the Preclose technique resulted in shorter overall procedure times compared with a similar cohort in which open femoral exposures were used (EVAR, 115 vs 128 min, P<.001; TEVAR, 80 vs 112, P=.019). Despite this reduction of procedure time, the savings on the cost of operating room time was negated by the cost of the Proglide devices ($295 per device).\nPercutaneous access for endovascular aortic repair is safe and feasible using the Proglide device. Although the success rates are higher for smaller size sheaths, successful closures may be obtained for up to 24F sheaths. Percutaneous access may result in shorter overall procedure times and potentially lower operating room costs, but this appears to be offset by the cost of the closure devices.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric bypass grafts may be followed postoperatively with duplex scanning. It is unknown, however, if duplex-derived velocity measurements vary over time or if the type of procedure (antegrade vs retrograde) and the caliber of graft affect velocity measurements. The purpose of this study was to characterize duplex findings in mesenteric bypass grafts with respect to the type of revascularization, graft caliber, and changes over time. This study also sought to identify duplex characteristics that could predict subsequent graft failure.\nDuplex examinations of mesenteric bypass grafts were reviewed. Peak systolic velocities (PSV) from the inflow artery, proximal anastomosis, mid graft, distal anastomosis, and outflow arteries were analyzed with respect to timing of the examination (index study vs follow-up exam), inflow source, distal target, and graft diameter. The results were compared with analysis of variance (P < .05). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine any association with mid-graft PSV.\nFasting postoperative duplex scans were reviewed from 43 mesenteric bypass grafts in 38 patients (28 superior mesenteric artery [SMA] alone, 3 celiac alone, 5 celiac and SMA, 2 SMA and renal). A total of 167 duplex exams were analyzed (mean of 4.5 studies per patient; range, 1 to 14). Inflow artery velocities were significantly lower in antegrade vs retrograde configurations (93 +/- 73 cm/s vs 154 +/- 73 cm/s, P < .05); however, proximal and mid-graft PSVs were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, no effect was noted on mid-graft PSV when distal targets were compared (SMA vs celiac, 149 +/- 42 cm/s vs 160 +/- 78 cm/s, P = NS). An association between smaller graft diameter and higher mid-graft PSV was seen with univariate analysis (P = .03), with a trend toward significance with multivariate analysis (P = .06). In 18 bypass grafts where a follow-up examination was available >1 year (mean 38 +/- 25 months) after the index postoperative exam, velocity did not significantly change over time. No duplex scan characteristics were predictive of graft thrombosis.\nThis is the first study, to our knowledge, to fully characterize duplex-derived flow velocities in mesenteric artery bypass grafts. Although surveillance duplex scans after mesenteric bypass procedures may be affected by graft diameter, they are not significantly affected by the choice of inflow artery. These data can serve as standards for postoperative surveillance of mesenteric bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "The management of renal artery stenosis in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms continues to be complex and technically challenging despite advances in endovascular therapy. There is growing concern about the durability of renal artery stents in the setting of transrenal abdominal aortic endografts. This study reports a single-center experience of renal artery stenting with transrenal abdominal aortic endografts for patients with renal artery stenosis.\nAll patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair preceded or followed by renal artery stent placement between January 1999 and December 2005 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively gathered endovascular database. Patients were surveyed after renal stent procedures with multidetector computed tomography angiography or duplex sonography. The surveillance data were analyzed for primary patency of the renal artery stent at 6 months, incidence of complications, need for secondary interventions, and changes in creatinine clearance (CrCl).\nSixty-two renal artery stents were placed in 56 patients (44 men, 12 women) with a mean age of 77.3 years (range, 61 to 94 years). Forty-one were placed before the endograft procedure, eight were placed during the endograft procedure, and 13 were placed postoperatively. There were no major or minor complications related to the renal artery stent procedures. Transrenal aortic endografts were used in 44 of the 56 patients, and 12 had devices with infrarenal fixation. The mean follow-up was 18.5 months (range, 1 to 73 months). The 6-month primary patency, which could be evaluated for 51 renal artery stents, was 97.4% (37/38) in patients with transrenal fixation and 84.6% (11/13) in patients with infrarenal fixation. The overall rate of in-stent restenosis was 8.5% (4/47) in the transrenal fixation group and 20.0% (3/15) in the infrarenal fixation group. The overall occlusion rate was 2.1% (1/47) in the transrenal fixation group and 0% (0/15) in infrarenal fixation group. Five (83.3%) of six patients underwent successful treatment of in-stent restenosis with placement of a new stent in all five cases. CrCl decreased in the total group by 4.2 +/- 11.8 mL/min, by 4.7 +/- 12.0 mL/min in patients with transrenal fixation, and by 2.2 +/- 11.0 mL/min in patients with infrarenal fixation.\nThe presence of a transrenal aortic endograft did not affect the outcome of the renal artery revascularization procedure in this cohort. Renal artery stenting in the presence of transrenal abdominal aortic endografts appears to be a safe procedure without adverse effect on renal artery stent patency or renal function.",

Thirteen subcutaneous cow foot veins were reperfused in situ, and the defined 50-mm vein segments in the study were treated with RFA (n = 2) and ELT (n = 11). RFA followed the clinical VNUS-Closure protocol (VNUS Medical Technologies, San Jose, Calif) using a 6F 60-mm Closure-Plus catheter. ELT was performed using light of lambda = 980 nm with a laser power of 3 (n = 2), 5 (n = 2), and 7 W (n = 4) with a paced pullback protocol with laser irradiation for 1.5 seconds every 3 mm, resulting in linear endovenous energy densities (LEED) of 15, 25, and 35 J/cm. Using 11 W (n = 3) with a continuous pullback protocol at 3 mm/s resulted in a LEED of 36.5 J/cm. Ten histologic cross sections of each treated and control vein segment were correlated with the corresponding eOCT cross sections to evaluate qualitative representation of vein wall layers and tissue alterations such as ablation and vein wall perforation. In addition, 26 eOCT cross sections of every treated vein segment before and after treatment and every control vein segment were analyzed to calculate quantitative changes in media thickness and vein lumen diameter.\nIn all specimens, qualitative analysis with eOCT demonstrated a clear match with histologic cross sections. A symmetrical, complete, circular disintegration of intima and media structures, without any transmural tissue defects, was shown after RFA. Pronounced semicircular tissue ablations (3 to 14 per 50 mm) and complete vessel wall perforations (0 to 16 per 50 mm) were detected after ELT. The quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant (P < .0001) increase in intima-media thickness after RFA (37.8% to 66.7%) and ELT (11.1% to 45.7%). A significant (P < .0001) reduction of vessel lumen diameter (36.3% to 42.2%) was found after RFA. Owing to the limited number of treated vein segments and inhomogeneous baseline vein lumen diameters, no linear correlation between laser energy level and effects on tissue such as ablation/perforation, media thickening, or vein lumen diameter could be identified.\nIn our ex vivo cow foot model, eOCT is able to reproduce normal vein wall structures and endovenous acute thermal alterations, such as tissue ablation and vessel wall perforations. Endovenous eOCT images can also be analyzed quantitatively to measure media thickness or vein lumen diameter. Endovascular OCT could become a valuable alternative tool for morphologic investigation of tissue alterations after endovenous thermal procedures.",

    "abstract": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) imparts a significant survival disadvantage to individuals undergoing lower extremity revascularization; however, the influence of lesser degrees of renal impairment remains unclear. This study examined the prognostic significance of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification on survival, limb salvage, and graft patency in patients undergoing lower extremity arterial reconstruction.\nA prospective registry was evaluated for consecutive patients between January 31, 1995, and December 21, 2004, undergoing first-time, lower extremity vein bypass surgery. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation using each patient's preoperative creatinine concentration. CKD categories were taken from current National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative staging criteria.\nThe cohort included 456 subjects, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 68.1 +/- 10.8 years. There were 274 men (60%) and 378 Caucasians (82.5%). Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus in 270 (59.0%), hypertension in 333 (72.7%), coronary artery disease in 242 (52.8%), and dyslipidemia in 203 (44.5%). The surgical indication was critical limb ischemia in 384 (83.8%). Among the variables examined, diabetes and critical ischemia as the indication for bypass were significantly skewed toward higher CKD classifications (P < .001). The 5-year survival rates by CKD class were, CKD 1 and 2, 57%; CKD 3, 46%; CKD 4, 23%; and CKD 5, 9.5%. On univariate analysis, age, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, critical ischemia, and CKD were significant predictors of mortality. After adjustment, however, only age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.06) and CKD stages 4 (HR, 4.23; 95% CI, 2.04 to 8.75) and 5 (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.96 to 5.45) retained significance. Subjects within the CKD 5 classification were more likely to have a major amputation (P = .018) compared with all other CKD classes. Notably, no relationship was detected between CKD category and graft patency.\nCKD staging adequately differentiates survival curves and risk for major amputation among patients with renal impairment who are undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery. This may help in clinical decision analysis as well as in the refinement of stratification in future clinical trial design where survival is an end point.",

    "abstract": "The elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) may decrease a patient's risk of rupture and confers a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate than emergency repair. Previous works have shown that AAA rupture rates are higher in women compared to men, and that women have higher associated in-hospital mortality rates. This study was performed to evaluate, currently, to what extent patient gender influences presentation and treatment of AAA and the associated outcomes in the United States.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used, with pertinent ICD-9 codes, to identify all patient-discharges that occurred with the primary diagnosis of intact (iAAA) or ruptured/dissecting (rAAA) abdominal aortic aneurysms between the years 2001 and 2004. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses of variables were performed.\nAn estimated 220,403 AAA patient-discharges were identified during the study period. 37,016 (17%) patients presented with rAAA. A higher percentage of women with AAA presented with rupture compared to men (21% vs 16%; odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.54). This rupture rate did not significantly change from 2001 to 2004 (P = .85 for trend). For iAAA, women had higher odds of in-hospital mortality than men (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.24-2.07). Compared to men, in-hospital mortality rates for women with iAAA were higher for both endovascular (2.1% vs 0.83%, P < .0001) and open repairs (6.1% vs 4.0%, P < .0001). For iAAA, fewer women underwent endovascular repair (32.4% vs 46.7%, P < .0001; O.R. 0.59, 95% CI, 0.52-0.67). For patients who presented with rAAA, women were less likely to undergo surgical intervention compared to men (59% vs 70%, P < .0001). For those that underwent repair, women had higher in-hospital mortality rates than men (43% vs 36%, P < .0001; OR 1.49, 95% CI, 1.16-1.91).\nA higher percentage of women currently present with aneurysm rupture. They have higher in-hospital mortality rates for both iAAA and rAAA.

    "abstract": "Patients after infrainguinal vein bypasses are a group at risk of graft stenosis and occlusion. Revision of failing grafts has been shown to significantly improve bypass patency and limb salvage. Options for surgical revision of mid bypass stenosis includes either patch angioplasty (PA) or interposition grafting (IG). We reviewed our experience with surgical revision of vein bypass stenosis.\nFrom April 1968 to March 2006, 7557 autogenous vein bypasses were performed at Albany Medical Center and its affiliated institutions, of these 316 required single or multiple revision of vein grafts with patch angioplasty or interposition vein grafting. Excluded were proximal and distal anastomotic revisions. Only 235 bypasses had single revisions as either patch angioplasty (n = 108) or interposition grafting (n = 127) and are the focus of this review. The initial bypass revisions in these two groups are analyzed for indications, clinical parameters, operative strategies, and long-term patencies and clinical outcomes.\nThere were no significant differences in mean age, gender, or frequency of comorbid conditions (coronary artery disease, pulmonary disease, hypertension, and diabetes) between the two patient groups. Secondary patency of patch angioplasty revision at 5 years was 79%. Patencies for interposition grafting revision at 5 years were equivalent to patch angioplasty group at 75%. When bypasses were evaluated on the basis of initial reconstructions (ie, in situ vs excised vein bypass), the results showed that in situ bypasses that required initial revision had similar 5-year patencies when interposition grafting was used as the first revision strategy vs patch angioplasty (80% vs 73%). Excised vein bypasses had similar patency when patch was their first revision strategy vs interposition grafting (4 year secondary patency 92% vs 75% respectively).\nAutogenous vein bypasses are at risk for developing significant stenosis and occlusion with time. Bypass stenosis that develops in the main body of the graft can be effectively repaired using either patch angioplasty or interposition grafting. Depending on the host of other factors, such as availability of autogenous venous conduit, location of stenosis, accessibility for operative repair, and the patient's anatomic characteristics, either operative strategy is effective in prolonging the patency of the bypass.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoscintigraphy has largely been performed to diagnose lymphedema. It is, however a time-consuming and expensive technique, which has not been covered by Japanese medical insurance since the year 2002. In this report we introduce a new imaging technique of fluorescent lymphography to diagnose lymphedema.\nFluorescence images of subcutaneous lymphatic drainage after subcutaneous injection of indocyanine green (ICG) at the foot were obtained using a newly developed near-infrared camera system. ICG fluorescent lymphography was performed in 12 patients with secondary lymphedema and 10 healthy volunteers. The 12 patients were diagnosed with secondary lymphedema according to the medical history and lymphoscintigram, of which 11 had a history of hysterectomy with extended lymph node dissection and local radiation therapy for uterine cancer. Lymphedema developed in one patient after femorotibial artery bypass for peripheral artery occlusive disease.\nFour abnormal fluorescent patterns of the lymph drainage were observed in lymphedema: dermal backflow (an abnormal filling of the lymph capillaries), extended fluorescent signal at the dorsum and plantar region of the foot, dilated lymph channels with proximal obliteration, and diffuse glittering of fluorescent signals with scattered twinkling of the dye. Continuous lymph channels from the injection site of the foot to the groin were observed along the medial aspect of thigh in healthy subjects.\nICG fluorescence lymphography is safe, simple, and minimally invasive. The device is portable and easy to use. The technique may be useful in clinical practice to identify presence of lymphatic disorder.",

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a sex-linked condition affecting about 1 of every 5000 males in the United States. The management of children with hemophilia can be improved with regular intravenous infusion of factor VIII or IX, thus preventing crippling and sometimes fatal hemorrhage. Maintaining this vital intravenous access is often hampered by gradual loss of superficial veins or repeated central catheter sepsis and thrombosis. This study reviewed an experience with arteriovenous fistula in selected hemophilia patients with limited venous access.\nConsecutive patients operated on between October 2000 and July 2006 for venous access with the creation of an arteriovenous fistula were reviewed. They were selected because of repeated problems with other venous access. Patency, ease of use, duplex scan derived brachial artery diameter, and arm length were assessed.\nDuring a 69-month period, 10 arteriovenous fistulas (five brachial artery-basilic vein fistulas, 5 brachial artery-cephalic vein fistulas) were created for nine patients. The patients were a median age of 5.5 years (range, 1 to 27 years), and all were <13 except the 27-year-old patient. There were no postoperative hematomas requiring evacuation. One arteriovenous fistula failed to mature and was redone in the opposite arm, which subsequently occluded after 13 months. Of the mature fistulas, patency was 100% at 1 year, 80% (4/5) at 3 years, and 75% (3/4) at 4 years, with mean follow-up of 22 months. Brachial artery diameter increased in the involved arm by a ratio of 1.95 (range, 1.51 to 2.5) compared with the opposite arm. Arm length disparity was increased by 0.5 cm (range, 0.8 to 1.5 cm) in the involved arm. All fistulas allowed good access at home by a care provider.\nFor hemophilia patients with compromised venous access, arteriovenous fistulas provide good early patency. Brachial artery diameter and arm length require continued follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The reported rate of subclinical brain injury after carotid artery stenting (CAS) seen on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) varies from 10% to >40%. Data from transcranial Doppler after CAS indicate that embolization may continue for several days, suggesting that that at least some lesions seen on DWI occur postprocedure. Because DWI lesions appear <or=1 hour of embolization, we used DWI to prospectively study patients before CAS, 1 hour after, and 48 hours after CAS to answer this question.\nThe study participants were 48 male patients aged 59 to 83. All patients were examined by a neurologist before and after the procedure and had DWI preprocedure and 48 hours postprocedure. In addition, 23 patients had a DWI 1 hour post-CAS. Magnetic resonance imaging exams, including axial and coronal DWI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, were read by two neuroradiologists blinded to the study timing. The embolic protection device was obtained from all patients, washed, and the contents examined under a digital microscope for fragments >or=60 microm.\nThere were two periprocedural strokes and one transient ischemic attack (TIA), but no strokes or TIAs occurred during follow-up. In the 23 patients imaged 1 hour postprocedure, new lesions were found in two (9%), and 18 (78%) had new lesions at 48 hours (P < .001). For the entire study group, the incidence of new lesions at 48 hours was 67% (36/54). The median number of DWI lesions was four (range, 1 to 17). Every protection device examined had atherosclerotic debris, with a mean of 135 +/- 73 fragments (range, 18 to 310) sized >60 microm and a mean of eight fragments (range, 2 to 21) sized >500 microm. Findings on postprocedure DWI did not correlate with the degree of stenosis, size of angioplasty balloon, or number of inflations, nor with the number or size of fragments retrieved from the protection device.\nCAS can be performed with a very low incidence of clinically evident neurologic events; however, it is associated with embolization during and after the procedure. Protection devices effectively prevent clinical and subclinical events during the procedure. Significant embolization continues for at least 48 hours postprocedure, causing lesions on DWI when there is no mechanism for cerebral protection. These data correlate with transcranial Doppler reports of continued embolization after CAS and indicate that DWI should be done as late as possible to accurately assess the rate of subclinical brain injury with CAS procedures.",

    "abstract": "A hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (AVF) requires surgical modification in patients with cardiac overload or dialysis access-associated steal syndrome (DASS). Creation of an artificial stenosis (banding) within the AVF may be used, but this technique lacks the guidance of objective parameters. The aim of this pilot study was to identify indicators that reflect AVF flow in dialysis patients with either access-related cardiac overload (CO) or DASS requiring corrective surgery.\nPatients underwent serial measurements of subclavian venous saturation (Sat(ven)), access flow (Flow(us)), and index digital pressures (P(dig)) during a corrective banding procedure.\nData were obtained in 14 individuals (9 men; mean age, 53 +/- 6 years) during 16 studies (CO, n = 8; DASS, n = 8). Before surgery, correlations between preoperative flow, Sat(ven) and P(dig) were not significant. Stepwise banding of the AVF altered Sat(ven) in both groups from a mean of 91% +/- 1% (open AVF) to 84% +/- 2% (closed AVF, P < .001). The CO patients demonstrated a larger drop (-13%) compared with the DASS patients (-4%). Values of P(dig) increased from 68 +/- 9 to 90 +/- 9 mm Hg (P < .001), and both groups demonstrated a similar +23 mm Hg increase. In concert, the digital brachial index also significantly improved in all patients from 0.60% +/- 0.09% to 0.74% +/- 0.10%. Linearity was present between alterations in Flow(us) and Sat(ven) in all patients, but mostly in the CO patients (r(2) = 0.96).\nStepwise banding of hemodialysis fistulas leads to dose-dependent decreases in flow and ipsilateral subclavian venous saturation combined with augmented digital pressures in patients with cardiac overload and dialysis associated steal syndrome. Intraoperative measurements of venous saturation and digital pressures may have the potential of guiding surgical correction in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are associated with improved outcome in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Statins may also have beneficial properties beyond their lipid-lowering effect.\nA prospective, observational cohort study was conducted at a university hospital from 1990 to 2005 to examine whether higher doses of statins and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are both independently associated with improved outcome in peripheral arterial disease. Enrolled were 1374 consecutive patients (age, 61 +/- 10 years, 73% male) with peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index <or=0.90). They were screened for clinical risk factors, statin therapy, and LDL cholesterol levels. Serial LDL cholesterol levels were measured at 6 months and yearly after enrollment. The mean follow-up time was 6.4 +/- 3.6 years, and no patients were lost to follow-up. The primary end points were all-cause and cardiac mortality. The secondary end point was the progression to kidney failure.\nOverall mortality, cardiac death, and progression to kidney failure occurred in 29%, 20%, and 5% of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher doses of statins (per 10% increase) and lower 6-month LDL cholesterol levels (per 10 mg/dL decrease) were both independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.80; and HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.98, respectively) and cardiac death (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.86; and HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.98, respectively). Higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also correlated significantly with lower all-cause and cardiac mortality. Higher doses of statins (per 10% increase) were associated with less progression to kidney failure (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.89).\nHigher doses of statins and lower LDL cholesterol levels are both independently associated with improved outcome in patients with peripheral arterial disease. These results support the view that statins have beneficial effects beyond their lipid-lowering properties and should be considered in all patients with PAD, irrespective of LDL cholesterol levels.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis of the immune system is maintained by apoptotic elimination of potentially pathogenic autoreactive lymphocytes. Emerging evidence shows that Fas-mediated apoptosis is impaired in activated lymphocytes from patients with autoimmune disease. The aim of this work was to assess apoptosis mediated by the cell death receptor Fas in peripheral T lymphocytes from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nThe apoptotic pathway was triggered by anti-Fas monoclonal antibodies in cultured and activated peripheral T-cell lines from 20 AAA patients with control groups of 15 patients with aortic atherosclerotic occlusive disease (AOD) and 25 healthy individuals. Cell survival and death (apoptosis) rate were assessed.\nCross-linkage of Fas receptor exerted a strong apoptotic response on T cells from AOD patients and healthy controls, but a much less pronounced effect on T cells from AAA patients. The evaluation of cell survival rate showed a significantly higher percentage in AAA group (98.9% +/- 10.3%) than in the AOD subjects (58.9% +/- 15.2%) or the healthy group (59.4% +/- 12.9%; P < .001). Apoptosis assessment by annexin V and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry showed similar results. The defect in AAA group was not due to decreased Fas expression, since Fas was expressed at normal levels. Moreover, it specifically involved the Fas system because cell death was induced in the normal way by methylprednisolone. Complementary DNA sequencing identified no causal Fas gene mutation, but two silent single nucleotide polymorphisms with higher frequency were found in the AAA group.\nFas-induced apoptosis in activated T cells from AAA patients is impaired. This may disturb the normal down-regulation of the immune response and thus provide a new insight into possible mechanisms and routes in the pathogenesis of AAA.",

The evaluation of cell survival rate showed a significantly higher percentage in AAA group (98.9% +/- 10.3%) than in the AOD subjects (58.9% +/- 15.2%) or the healthy group (59.4% +/- 12.9%; P < .001). Apoptosis assessment by annexin V and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry showed similar results. The defect in AAA group was not due to decreased Fas expression, since Fas was expressed at normal levels. Moreover, it specifically involved the Fas system because cell death was induced in the normal way by methylprednisolone. Complementary DNA sequencing identified no causal Fas gene mutation, but two silent single nucleotide polymorphisms with higher frequency were found in the AAA group.",

    "abstract": "In patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), distal revascularization remains the procedure of choice for preventing limb loss, but long-term outcomes for pain relief, wound healing, and prevention of amputation remain suboptimal. Prostaglandin drug therapy as an adjuvant to revascularization may improve these outcomes. The current trial was designed to test the hypothesis that the use of lipo-ecraprost, a lipid encapsulated prostaglandin E(1) prodrug, as an adjunctive therapy after distal revascularization would improve amputation-free survival in patients with CLI.\nThe study was randomized, multicenter, double blind, and placebo controlled. Patients meeting clinical and hemodynamic criteria for CLI who were undergoing either bypass or endovascular revascularization of the below knee popliteal or more distal arteries were randomized to receive placebo or a 60-microg dose of lipo-ecraprost administered intravenously starting <or=72 hours of the index revascularization and then 5 days per week for 8 weeks. The study primary end point was the composite end point of death or amputation at or above the level of the ankle at 180 days.\nThe study randomized 322 patients, and 284 received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 213 patients underwent surgical bypass, and 71 underwent endovascular revascularization before receiving study medication. The distribution of index revascularization procedures and location of distal target arteries were similar for both placebo and lipo-ecraprost groups. At 180 days, 21 patients (7.4%) were lost to follow-up before reaching the primary end point. Seventy-one percent of the patients taking the placebo completed at least half the doses of the study medication compared with 48% of those taking lipo-ecraprost. Index leg revascularization-assisted primary patency was 82% in the placebo group and 84% in the lipo-ecraprost group (P = .874). Changes in lower extremity hemodynamics as a result of the revascularization during the study period did not differ between the placebo and lipo-ecraprost treatment arms. For the primary event of amputation-free survival, there were no differences between groups: 19 major amputations occurred in the placebo group and 17 in the lipo-ecraprost group; 19 deaths occurred in the placebo group and 13 in the lipo-ecraprost group.\nEight weeks of parenteral therapy with lipo-ecraprost after distal revascularization in patients with CLI provided no additional benefit in the reduction of major amputation or death at 180 days.",

    "abstract": "We sought to define the current anatomic barriers to thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) stent grafting to guide future device development.\nAll patients presenting with TAA requiring repair were evaluated for endovascular repair during a 4-year period (2000 to 2004). The TAAs evaluated were those beginning distal to the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and ending proximal to the celiac artery. All patients in whom endovascular repair was indicated underwent cross-sectional imaging by computed tomography angiography and three-dimensional modeling of their thoracic and abdominal arterial anatomy. Patients were evaluated for endovascular TAA repair in the context of the inclusion/exclusion criteria of pivotal United States Food and Drug Administration trials of the Gore TAG and Medtronic Talent devices. Anatomic requirements included >or=20 mm of suitable proximal and distal neck length, and proximal and distal neck diameters of 20 to 42 mm. These trials allowed the use of femoral or iliac access, including the use of conduits, and permitted stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) after preliminary carotid-subclavian bypass. Patients rejected for medical reasons or who died during evaluation were not included in the review.\nA total of 126 patients (73 men, 53 women) with TAA located between the LCCA and celiac artery were screened for endovascular repair, and 33 (26%) were rejected for anatomic reasons. The remaining 93 patients underwent endografting (59 Talent, 34 TAG). Rejection was not significantly different by gender (16/73 men, 17/53 women, P = .22, NS). Most patients (28/33) were rejected for more than one criterion. Hostile proximal neck characteristics were the most prevalent reason for disqualification, despite the ability to cover the LSA to extend the proximal seal zone. Many of these patients (16/28) also had distal neck anatomy unsuitable for grafting. Overall, 19 patients had hostile distal necks. Difficulties with vascular access (diseased or tortuous iliac arteries, or a small caliber aorta) that could not be overcome even by use of conduits occurred in a significant fraction of patients (10/33).\nMost patients with a TAA located between the LCCA and the celiac artery can be treated by endovascular repair. Patients excluded from TAA stent graft protocols for anatomic reasons most commonly have hostile proximal neck features that preclude endovascular repair with currently available devices. Transposition of arch vessels to facilitate greater use of existing stent grafts or development of new stent graft designs are needed to expand the applicability of TAA endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "More than half of all cerebral ischemic events are the result of rupture of extracranial plaques. The clinical determination of carotid plaque vulnerability is currently based solely on luminal stenosis; however, it has been increasingly suggested that plaque morphology and biomechanical stress should also be considered. We used finite element analysis based on in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to simulate the stress distributions within plaques of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.\nThirty non-consecutive subjects (15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic) underwent high-resolution multisequence in vivo MRI of the carotid bifurcation. Stress analysis was performed based on the geometry derived from in vivo MRI of the carotid artery at the point of maximal stenosis. The finite element analysis model considered plaque components to be hyperelastic. The peak stresses within the plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were compared.\nHigh stress concentrations were found at the shoulder regions of symptomatic plaques, and the maximal stresses predicted in this group were significantly higher than those in the asymptomatic group (508.2 +/- 193.1 vs 269.6 +/- 107.9 kPa; P = .004).\nMaximal predicted plaque stresses in symptomatic patients were higher than those predicted in asymptomatic patients by finite element analysis, suggesting the possibility that plaques with higher stresses may be more prone to be symptomatic and rupture. If further validated by large-scale longitudinal studies, biomechanical stress analysis based on high resolution in vivo MRI could potentially act as a useful tool for risk assessment of carotid atheroma. It may help in the identification of patients with asymptomatic carotid atheroma at greatest risk of developing symptoms or mild-to-moderate symptomatic stenoses, which currently fall outside current clinical guidelines for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Intuitively, vascular procedures performed by high-volume vascular subspecialists working at high-volume institutions should be associated with improved patient outcome. Although a large number of studies assess the relationship between volume and outcome, a single contemporary compilation of such studies is lacking.\nA review of the English language literature was performed incorporating searches of the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane collaboration databases for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (elective and emergent), carotid endarterectomy, and arterial lower limb procedures for any volume outcome relationship. Studies were included if they involved a patient cohort from 1980 onwards, were community or population based, and assessed health outcomes (mortality and morbidity) as a dependent variable and volume as an independent variable.\nWe identified 74 relevant studies, and 54 were included. All showed either an inverse relationship of variable magnitude between provider volume and mortality, or no volume-outcome effect. The reduction in the risk-adjusted mortality rate (RAMR) for high-volume providers was 3% to 11% for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, 2.5 to 5% for emergent AAA repair, 0.7% to 4.7% carotid endarterectomy, and 0.3% to 0.9% for lower limb arterial bypass procedures. Subspeciality training also conferred a considerable morbidity and mortality benefit for emergent AAA repair, carotid endarterectomy, and lower limb arterial procedures.\nHigh-volume providers have significantly better outcomes for vascular procedures both in the elective and emergent setting. Subspeciality training also has a considerable impact. These data provide further evidence for the specialization of vascular services, whereby vascular procedures should generally be preformed by high-volume, speciality trained providers.",

Three patients who required readmission after their vascular interventions were treated with negative pressure wound therapy. Once adequate control of the drainage was obtained, the patients were discharged home with a portable suction unit. The mean time to stop lymph leak was 14 days, and the mean length of hospital stay was 7.3 days. This method of management offers early control of fluid drainage, rapid control of the wound, earlier closure, and the potential for reduced length of stay. Patient acceptance and convenience may be enhanced by outpatient management and return to work in appropriately motivated individuals.",

    "abstract": "We present the first reported case of a carotid artery stent fracture where a Nitinol stent was used for the management of carotid artery stenosis. An 83-year-old man underwent right carotid artery stenting in July 2005. On follow-up ultrasound, stenosis of the right internal carotid artery was noted. In January 2006, he underwent left carotid artery stenting and at this procedure, precontrast assessment of the right neck revealed a complete fracture through the waist of the stent in the right internal carotid artery. This fractured segment correlated with the area of stenosis reported at the previous ultrasound. In July 2006, this gentleman underwent successful removal of the carotid stent with uneventful carotid endarterectomy and synthetic patch repair. Carotid artery stenting is a newer and alternative modality to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of carotid artery stenting. More data are emerging to support its safety and efficacy. An unexpected complication can happen with any procedure and complications help define the follow-up management of subsequent patients undergoing this procedure.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia is a common cause of vein graft failure in cardiovascular surgery. The molecular basis for intimal hyperplasia remains poorly defined. We have previously identified, by gene chip analysis of vein grafts, increased messenger (mRNA) for the adhesion molecule cadherin 11/osteoblast-cadherin (CDH11). The function of CDH11 in vascular cells is unknown. The aim of the present study is to confirm CDH11 expression in vein grafts and characterize its role in vascular remodeling.\nCephalic vein interposition grafts were implanted in a canine model and harvested at predetermined time points. CDH11 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Early passage human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were used for in vitro studies. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess cellular CDH11 mRNA levels. CDH11 signaling was inhibited by either transfection with silencing RNA targeting CDH11 or with a blocking antibody to CDH11. Cellular migration was evaluated and cellular proliferation was assessed.\nExpression of CDH11 was increased in medial SMCs of vein grafts recovered at 7, 14, and 30 days after surgery compared with control veins from the same animals. In vitro CDH11 mRNA was up-regulated 1.8 +/- 0.2-fold (P = .003) in SMCs after treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Cellular migration was attenuated by inhibition of CDH11 both with a blocking antibody (0.67 +/- 0.09; P = .063) and gene knockdown mediated by small interfering RNA (0.67 +/- 0.14; P = .036). SMC proliferation decreased by 3.1-fold (P = .006) in the presence of CDH11-blocking antibody. Knockdown of CDH11 mediated by small interfering RNA resulted in a 1.3-fold (P = .018) decrease in proliferation.\nCDH11 is up-regulated in SMC in vivo and in vitro as part of the response to injury. Inhibition of CDH11 decreases SMC migration and proliferation, two pathogenic effectors of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines are inflammatory mediators implicated in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis. The cytokine expression profile of the AAA is poorly defined and has focused on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, at the expense of chemokines and growth factors. This study aims to investigate the cytokine expression profile of the established AAA wall.\nCytokine protein expression was measured in homogenized human aortic tissue (10 AAAs and 9 nonaneurysmal controls) using a 42-cytokine antibody-based protein array. Data were quantified using densitometric analysis and statistically analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test.\nA significant difference in cytokine expression between AAA and control samples was found in 15 of 42 cytokines. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines were upregulated within the AAA compared with the control: interleukin (IL)-6 (P = .001), IL-1alpha (P = .001), IL-1beta (P < .001), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (P = .002), TNF-beta (P = .002), and oncostatin M (P = .007). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also upregulated (P = .002). Members of the chemokine family were also highly expressed within AAA samples: IL-8 (P = .001), epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 (ENA-78; P = .006), growth related oncogene (GRO; P < .001), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (P = .003), MCP-2 (P < .001), and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES; P = .001). Of the growth factors examined, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF; P = .003) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF; P = .004) were significantly higher in the AAA.\nThe established AAA is characterized by a distinct cytokine profile consisting of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and specific growth factors. This suggests that these cytokines may contribute to pathologic changes within the established, preruptured aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Older patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication have impaired walking ability resulting from reduced lower extremity blood flow. Evidence suggests that leg muscle abnormalities may also contribute to walking intolerance in claudicants. In healthy elderly people, leg muscle protein synthesis can be augmented by nutritional supplementation with amino acids; preliminary data suggest that this increases muscle mass, walking ability, and functional status. In this study, we investigated whether amino acid supplementation would improve leg muscle protein synthesis in elderly PAD subjects, given that reduced leg blood flow might restrict the availability of amino acids to muscle.\nTwo groups participated in the study: a group of 11 claudicants (mean age, 62 years; mean ankle-brachial index, 0.62; 46% male) and a group of 9 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean ankle-brachial index, 1.1). Both groups underwent measurement of leg blood flow by using strain gauge plethysmography, as well as measurement of baseline and amino acid-stimulated protein synthesis in leg muscle. Protein synthesis was quantified from calf muscle biopsy samples by measurement of the fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of protein, by using the incorporation of the stable isotope l-[ring-(2)H(5)]-phenylalanine into muscle protein. Total protein was extracted from muscle samples, and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy methodology was used to measure incorporation rates. After measurement of basal FSR, all subjects were given an oral drink of 15 g of essential amino acids, and the measurements of FSR were repeated. Data are expressed as mean +/- SD; statistical analysis of differences between the two groups (with and without amino acid supplementation) was performed by using analysis of variance with repeated measures.\nCalf blood flow was reduced in the PAD subjects compared with controls (1.44 +/- 0.53 mL/min per 100 mg of tissue vs 2.40 +/- 0.57 mL/min per 100 mg of tissue; P = .005; t test). FSR in the basal state was equivalent between the two groups (healthy, 0.060% +/- 0.025% per hour; PAD, 0.061% +/- 0.029% per hour; P = .97). Equivalent increases (P < .05) occurred in both groups in response to oral amino acid supplementation (healthy, 0.087% +/- 0.012% per hour; PAD, 0.104% +/- 0.041% per hour; P > .05; analysis of variance).\nDespite reduced leg blood flow, elderly PAD patients synthesize calf muscle protein in the basal state in a fashion similar to that in healthy elderly people. More importantly, administration of exogenous amino acids produces a significant increase in protein synthesis in these patients that is also equivalent to that in healthy elderly people. Our goal is to use these results as the basis for an intervention study to determine whether long-term oral amino acids, by augmenting calf muscle protein synthesis, increase calf muscle mass, walking ability, and functional status in elderly claudicants.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate factors influencing the outcome of all open operations for aortoiliofemoral (AIF) revascularization performed by a single surgeon at a tertiary referral center.\nThe series included 355 direct reconstructions and 181 extra-anatomic bypass (EAB) grafts in 339 men (63%) and 197 women, with median ages of 61 and 62 years, respectively. These procedures were done for claudication alone in 267 patients (50%), for advanced ischemia in 258 (48%), and to facilitate other interventions in 11 (2.0%). Simultaneous infrainguinal bypass was necessary in 36 patients (6.7%). Survival and patency analyses were performed using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier estimations, and proportional hazards models.\nPatients receiving EAB were older (P < .001) and were more likely to have advanced preoperative limb ischemia (P < .001), superficial femoral artery occlusions (P < .001), a history of previous lower extremity inflow operations (P < .001), elevated serum creatinine (P = .017), and clinically severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .016). On multivariable analysis, EAB resulted in a higher incidence of postoperative death (8.8% vs 2.3%, P = .005) or graft thrombosis (8.8% vs 2.8%, P = .006) than direct reconstruction. Women were more likely to sustain graft thrombosis (P = .006) or require major amputation (P = .050), or both, during the early postoperative period. Overall late survival rates were 87% +/- 3% at 1 year, 64% +/- 5% at 5 years, 39% +/- 5% at 10 years, and 20% +/- 4% at 15 years. Late survival rates were significantly lower (P = .026) after EAB and also were unfavorably associated with advanced preoperative ischemia (P = .046) as well as with several medical comorbidities (P < .001). Primary limb-based patency rates were 95% +/- 2% at 1 year, 85% +/- 3% at 5 years, 77% +/- 5% at 10 years, and 69% +/- 7% at 15 years. Late occlusions occurred more frequently in patients who had undergone previous inflow procedures (P = .028) and were especially common after EAB (P < .001). Patients >65 years had higher early and late mortality rates than younger patients (P < .001), but younger patients had lower long-term patency rates (P < .001).\nThe worse operative mortality and late survival rates for EAB in this series largely were preordained by the frequent selection of EAB for patients who represented poor medical risks for direct AIF reconstruction. However, the durability of aortofemoral, aortoiliac, or iliofemoral bypass compared with either femorofemoral or axillofemoral bypass makes direct reconstruction clearly superior for average or low-risk patients. Direct reconstruction should be used preferentially in such cases, especially in women and for younger patients of either gender.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests an autoimmune component to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. This study was conducted to determine if a difference exists in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele distribution between patients with AAA and population controls, and between patients with small and large AAA.\nPatients with known AAA attending the vascular unit were consented for recruitment. HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR was determined by polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The distribution of these alleles in the Northern Ireland general population was obtained from the histocompatibility and immunogenetics database. The chi(2) test was used for statistical analysis with Bonferroni correction.\nA total of 241 AAA patients were recruited, with a wide range of aneurysm size. In class I, the most frequent allele families were HLA-A*02 and *01 and HLA-B*07, *08, and *44. In class II, HLA-DRB1*03, *04, *07, and *15 were the most frequent. HLA-A*11 was lower in AAA cases (10.4% vs 15.0%; P = .08), whereas HLA-B*08 was lower in the controls (29.8% vs 36.5%; P = .05) and HLA-DRB1*11 was lower in cases (4.2% vs 8.1%; P = .05). After Bonferroni correction, however, the proportion of allele families was not significantly different in AAA patients compared with the proportion seen in controls. HLA-DRB1*11 and *14 had a lower prevalence in large AAAs (0.9% vs 6.7% [P = .05]; 0.0% vs 5.9% [P = .03]). HLA-A*68 was also lower in large AAA (1.9% vs 11.9%; P = .0075). After Bonferroni correction, however, no difference was demonstrated between small and large aneurysms.\nThis study provides more definitive results on this important subject and has failed to demonstrate the risk association between AAA and these alleles as reported by others. Therefore, the role of these particular genes and the autoimmune component in AAA etiology does not appear to be as crucial as previously proposed.",

Indications for CEA were asymptomatic 70% to 99% internal carotid artery stenosis in 242 (77.1%), transient ischemic attacks (including transient monocular blindness) in 45 (14.3%), and prior stroke in 27 (8.6%). Mean common carotid artery pressure before clamping, mean SP after carotid clamping, and intraarterial pressure were continuously monitored in all patients. An indwelling shunt was placed when neurologic events (contralateral motor weakness, aphasia, loss of consciousness, or seizures) occurred, regardless of SP or EEG changes.\nShunt placement was necessary because of neurologic changes in 10% (32/314) of all CEAs performed under CBA. Only 3 patients (1.4%) of 216 required shunt placement if SP was 50 mm Hg or more, vs 29 (29.6%) of 98 if SP was less than 50 mm Hg (P < .00001; sensitivity, 29.8%; specificity, 98.6%). In patients with SP of 40 mm Hg or more, 7 (2.6%) of 270 required shunt placement, vs 25 (56.8%) of 44 if SP was less than 40 mm Hg (P < .00001; sensitivity, 56.8%; specificity, 97.4%). Ischemic EEG changes were observed in 19 (59.4%) of 32 patients (false-negative rate, 40.6%) requiring shunt placement under CBA. Three patients had false-positive EEG results and did not require shunt placement (false-positive rate, 1.0%). The perioperative stroke/death rate was 4 (1.2%) in 314. All strokes occurred after surgery and were unrelated to cerebral ischemia or lack of shunt placement.\nTen percent of patients required a shunt placement during CEA under CBA. Shunt placement was necessary in 56.8% of patients with SP less than 40 mm Hg. EEG identified cerebral ischemia in only 59.4% of patients needing shunt placement, with a false-positive rate of 1.0% and a false-negative rate of 40.6%. Both SP and EEG as a guide to shunt placement have poor sensitivity. Intraoperative monitoring of the awake patients under regional anesthesia (CBA) is the most sensitive and specific method to identify patients requiring shunt placement.",

Patency was defined as continued presence of palpable pulses or maintenance of postoperative ankle-brachial index +/- 0.15. Statistical methods included chi(2), t test, Fisher's exact test, and Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank comparison.\nA total of 56 popliteal artery aneurysm repairs were performed. All endovascular popliteal aneurysm repairs (EVPAR, n = 15) were performed using Viabahn endoprostheses. Patients with open repair (OR, n = 41) underwent surgical bypass and aneurysm exclusion with great saphenous vein (n = 26), short saphenous vein (n = 3), or polytetrafluoroethylene (n = 12), through either a medial (n = 28) or posterior (n = 13) approach. All urgent cases received open repair. Technical success was 100% in both groups. Mean follow-up was 16.5 +/- 3 months (range, 0.5 to 56 months). Aneurysm size, location, and outflow were similar between groups. Primary patency, secondary patency, and survival did not differ between groups. Endoleaks were observed in three (20%) of 15 endovascular cases, and type I and III endoleaks were treated with additional endografts.\nTo our knowledge, this represents the largest United States series of EVPAR to date. Early mid-term results of elective endovascular repair of popliteal artery aneurysms are encouraging. Further studies are warranted to define optimal indications for EVPAR and to generate long-term outcomes for this technique.",

    "abstract": "Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a complex congenital anomaly featuring two or more of the following: (1) capillary malformations (port-wine stains), (2) soft tissue or bony hypertrophy (or both), and (3) varicose veins or venous malformations. With the purpose of determining the actual significance of venous impairment in patients with KTS, we quantified the venous valvular competency and calf muscle pump function and examined their effect on clinical severity.\nIncluded were patients with near-normal function of affected limb(s) and minimal/small foot hypertrophy. Excluded were those with deep venous hypoplasia, aplasia or thrombosis, lymphedema, limb length discrepancy (>2.5 cm), peripheral arterial (ankle-brachial index <1.0), or cardiac disease and walking impairment. Venous duplex scanning, ascending venography, magnetic resonance imaging, strain gauge plethysmography, and a bone scanogram were performed. We studied eight men and seven women aged 15 to 51 years (median, 24 years). The KTS involved 17 limbs (unilateral in 13 patients and bilateral in 2). Contralateral limbs in patients with unilateral KTS acted as controls (n = 13). Venous clinical severity was graded according to the CEAP and venous clinical severity score (VCSS), and reflux complexity was classified according to the venous segmental disease score. Outflow obstruction (outflow fraction at 1 and 4 seconds; OF(1) and OF(4), respectively), reflux (venous filling index), calf muscle pump function (ejection fraction), and hypertension (residual volume fraction) were determined in both limbs with strain gauge plethysmography. Data, reported as median and interquartile range, were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test.\nVaricose veins or venous malformations occurred in the medial, posterior, or anterolateral limb segments of the ankle (7/17, 7/17, and 9/17), calf (10/17, 8/17, and 12/17), knee (9/17, 8/17, and 8/17), and thigh (10/17, 6/17, and 8/17, respectively). Venous malformations occupied the subcutaneous space (17/17) and extended into the subfascial space in 6 (35.3%) of 17 limbs. Abnormal reflux (>0.5 seconds) was distributed in the great (64.7%; 11/17) and small (5.9%; 1/17) saphenous veins and the common femoral (23.5%; 4/17), femoral (41.1%; 7/17), popliteal (29.4%; 5/17), perforator (70.6%; 12/17), and axial calf (35.3%; 6/17) veins. There was no difference in the OF(1) and OF(4) between the affected limbs and the controls. Limbs with KTS had a fivefold greater venous filling index (0.133-0.46 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1); 0.258 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1)) than the controls (0.034-0.055 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1); 0.046 mL . 100 mL(-1) . s(-1); P < .0001), and this was linked to a higher venous segmental disease score (3 [2-4] vs 0 [0-1]; P < .0001). Limbs with KTS had half the ejection fraction (20.8%; 12.3%-24%) of the controls (39.3%; 30.9%-64.6%) and twice as high a residual venous fraction (77% [69.6%-84.5%] vs 40.9% [20.6%-60%]; both P < .004). Patients complained of swelling (100%; 15/15), aching (100%; 15/15), pain (93.3%; 14/15) and heaviness (100%; 15/15), tiredness (66.7%; 10/15), and tightness (33.3%; 5/15) of the limb(s) with KTS. Limbs with KTS had a worse (1) venous clinical severity by 11 VCSS points (11 [8-12] vs 0 [0-1]) and (2) clinical status by 3 CEAP classes (C3 [C3-C4] vs C0 [C0-C2]) than the control limbs (both P < .0001).\nVenous disease in limbs with KTS is a major source of morbidity in affected patients. Limbs with KTS are characterized by complex reflux patterns, severe valvular incompetence, calf muscle pump impairment, and venous hypertension, thus explaining the advanced clinical severity (VCSS) and CEAP grade.",

    "abstract": "We describe and report our results using endoscopic vein harvest (EVH) for lower extremity arterial bypass procedures, following the implementation of technical modifications specific to patients undergoing limb salvage procedures.\nWe underwent training in EVH, followed by implementation of the technique in patients requiring limb salvage for lower extremity ischemia and aneurysms. After technical modifications in the technique were developed for limb salvage, we reviewed our experience in all patients who underwent minimally invasive distal bypass with EVH.\nTechnical modifications include limited arterial dissection before vein harvest, the use of proximal and distal leg incisions for both exposure of arterial vessels and saphenous vein harvest, improved hemostasis techniques in the vein graft tunnel, avoidance of compression wraps to the ipsilateral harvest tunnel, complete removal of the vein with either reversed or nonreversed graft placement, and use of the endoscopic tunnel for conduit placement. Thirteen patients (14 limbs) have undergone minimally invasive distal bypass since technical modifications were implemented. Indications for EVH were rest pain (n = 12; 85.7%) and tissue loss (n = 8; 57.1%). Veins harvested were the ipsilateral great saphenous vein (n = 10; 71.4%), contralateral great saphenous vein (n = 2; 14.3%), and short saphenous vein (n = 2; 14.3%). No venous injuries occurred during endoscopic harvest, and all were used for bypass. Thirty-day primary and primary assisted patency rates were 85.7% and 92.9%, respectively. The limb salvage rate was 100%. Two patients developed postoperative hematomas, one early and one late, as a result of anticoagulation for cardiac comorbidities. Both patients required reoperation for successful re-establishment of patency. There were no perioperative deaths and no postoperative wound infections or complications. Two patients required a later prosthetic bypass, and two required a vein graft angioplasty. Complete wound healing was achieved in 75% of patients with preoperative tissue loss.\nTechnical modifications in endoscopic saphenous vein harvest techniques facilitate their use in lower extremity limb salvage procedures. Vascular surgeons should become familiar with these techniques to minimize vein harvest wound complications and extend the options for limb salvage conduits, including use of both the ipsilateral and contralateral saphenous vein and the short saphenous vein. Meticulous hemostasis within the tunnel after endoscopic conduit harvest and avoidance of postoperative anticoagulation should help to prevent postoperative hematoma formation and early graft occlusion.",

    "abstract": "The best way to manage both symptomatic and asymptomatic severe carotid stenoses has been thoroughly demonstrated by large randomized clinical trials, but less is known about the natural history and management of the contralateral asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA). This prospective study was undertaken to determine whether disease progressed in the contralateral ICA of patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and were followed up clinically and by duplex ultrasound (US) scan.\nThe contralateral asymptomatic ICAs of 599 patients who had undergone CEA for severe carotid disease over a 10-year period were followed up clinically and with duplex US scan at 1 month and then every 6 months. ICA stenosis was classified as mild (30%-49%), moderate (50%-69%), severe (70%-99%), or occlusion. Progression was defined as an increase in ICA stenosis of 50% or more for ICAs with a less than 50% baseline lesion or as an increase to a higher category if the baseline stenosis was 50% or more. End points of the study were the incidence of contralateral disease progression and late neurologic events. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate freedom from disease progression and from neurologic events. The relationship between progression and risk factors was also analyzed.\nOverall, disease progressed in 25.2% of patients (151/599) after a mean follow-up of 4.1 years. Disease progressed in 34.3% of patients (101/294) with mild stenosis vs 47.9% of patients with moderate stenosis (47/98; P = .016). Three additional patients with mild lesions at baseline progressed to severe lesions. The median time to progression was 29.8 months for mild and 18.5 months for moderate stenoses (P = .033). The rate of late neurologic events referable to the contralateral ICA was 3.2% (19/599) for the entire series and 4.8% (19/392) for patients with a 30% or greater ICA stenosis: these included 4 (0.7%) strokes and 15 (2.5%) transient ischemic attacks. All but 3 events (16.3%; 16/98) occurred in patients with disease progression from moderate to severe stenosis. Overall, 53 late CEAs were performed.\nThis prospective analysis has shown that disease progression in contralateral asymptomatic ICAs after CEA is relatively common in patients with a diseased ICA at the baseline and strongly supports duplex US surveillance, approximately every 6 months, in patients with more than mild disease. A baseline lesion is significantly predictive of progression to severe stenosis, and progression from moderate to severe stenosis is strongly associated with neurologic clinical events. No demographic or clinical factor proved useful in identifying patients likely to experience disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Correlation of carotid duplex ultrasound (DUS) flow velocities with carotid artery stenosis before and after carotid endarterectomy is well established. With the evolution of catheter-based techniques, carotid stenosis increasingly is being treated with angioplasty and stenting (CAS). CAS changes the physical properties of the arterial wall, which may alter blood flow velocities compared with the nonstented carotid. Opinions differ about whether DUS is a reliable tool to assess technical outcome and recurrent stenosis after CAS. This study correlated carotid DUS flow velocity findings with carotid arteriography after CAS.\nData from 77 pairs of carotid arteriograms with corresponding DUS after CAS in 68 patients were reviewed. Preintervention and postintervention DUS and carotid arteriogram data were evaluated for each patient. Peak systolic velocities (PSV), end-diastolic velocities (EDV), and internal carotid artery/common carotid artery ratios (ICA/CCA) were correlated with the post-CAS arteriogram.\nThe mean preintervention PSV was 390 +/- 110 cm/s (range, 216 to 691 cm/s), and the average EDV was 134 +/- 51 cm/s (range, 35 to 314 cm/s). Postintervention DUS was obtained a mean of 5 days after CAS (range, 1 to 30 days). Sixty (81%) post-CAS arteriograms were normal, and each corresponded to a normal postintervention DUS (PSV range, 30 to 118 cm/s; EDV range, 18 to 60 cm/s). In 14 arteries (19%), completion arteriograms revealed residual stenoses of 20% to 40% in 13, and 50% in one. The mean PSV was 175 cm/s (range, 137 to 195 cm/s), and the mean EDV was 44 cm/s (range, 20 to 62 cm/s). All velocities exceeded the threshold of a 50% stenosis by DUS criteria for a nonstented carotid artery. In three arteries (2 patients), high-grade recurrent stenoses detected by DUS developed that required reintervention during follow-up. This high-grade restenosis was confirmed by arteriography in each patient, providing an additional three correlations.\nNormal DUS imaging reliably identifies arteriographically normal carotid arteries after CAS. Carotid velocities are disproportionately elevated with mild and moderate degrees of stenoses, and velocity criteria for quantitating stenoses in these patients require modification. However, DUS appropriately identifies severe recurrent stenoses after CAS.",

Postintervention DUS was obtained a mean of 5 days after CAS (range, 1 to 30 days). Sixty (81%) post-CAS arteriograms were normal, and each corresponded to a normal postintervention DUS (PSV range, 30 to 118 cm/s; EDV range, 18 to 60 cm/s). In 14 arteries (19%), completion arteriograms revealed residual stenoses of 20% to 40% in 13, and 50% in one. The mean PSV was 175 cm/s (range, 137 to 195 cm/s), and the mean EDV was 44 cm/s (range, 20 to 62 cm/s). All velocities exceeded the threshold of a 50% stenosis by DUS criteria for a nonstented carotid artery. In three arteries (2 patients), high-grade recurrent stenoses detected by DUS developed that required reintervention during follow-up. This high-grade restenosis was confirmed by arteriography in each patient, providing an additional three correlations.",

    "abstract": "To determine the prevalence of uncommon ulcers, unrelated to venous or arterial etiology, in patients presenting to vascular clinics.\nThis was a multicenter prospective study of consecutive patients presenting with lower extremity ulceration. The settings were university hospital outpatient centers and venous clinics. A total of 799 limbs in 710 patients with leg ulcers were evaluated. Patients with venous ulcer disease and with evidence of arterial disease with an ankle-brachial index less than 0.7 were excluded from the study. Out of 710 patients, 17 patients with a total of 21 limbs fit the criteria for inclusion. All limbs included in this study underwent physical examination, ankle-brachial index measurements, duplex ultrasonography, and skin biopsies.\nThe mean age of patients with uncommon ulcers was 65.6 years, and the mean duration was 5.5 years. A total of 2.1% of all leg ulcers seen were due to uncommon etiology unrelated to venous or arterial pathology. Most of these ulcers were located in the medial lower calf (n = 19). In six patients with ulcers, the histology did not reveal any specific cause; five had a neoplasia, three had chronic inflammation, two had sickle cell disease, two had vasculitis, one had rheumatoid arthritis, one had pyoderma gangrenosum, and one had ulcer due to hydroxyurea.\nThe prevalence of leg ulcers unrelated to arterial and venous disease that presented with signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease was 2.1%. Their etiology is variable, most often including vasculitis, neoplasia, metabolic disorders, infection, and other rare causes. Early identification of uncommon ulcers may facilitate timely and appropriate management.",

    "abstract": "A previous meta-analysis reported on the mid-term outcomes of infrainguinal bypass grafts in patients with critical limb ischemia and end-stage renal disease. Given the competing interest in endovascular procedures, the results of bypass surgery must be assessed as precisely as possible for future comparison. In this study, the original meta-analysis was refined and updated by increasing the number of studies reviewed, estimating primary graft patency, extending follow-up time, and investigating the problem of early amputation despite a patent graft.\nStudies published from 1987 through 2005 were identified from two electronic databases. Two investigators independently extracted the survival data from life tables, survival curves, and texts. Pooled survival curves were then constructed for graft patency, limb salvage, and patient survival according to a random-effects protocol for meta-analysis.\nOf 28 articles included, 18 reported amputation despite a patent graft in 84 (10%) out of 844 limbs, and 25 described a perioperative mortality of 88 (8.8%) out of 996 patients. The 5-year pooled estimate (SE) was 50.4% (15.4%) for primary patency, 50.8% (19.0%) for secondary patency, 66.6% (11.2%) for limb salvage, and 23.0% (11.7%) for patient survival. No publication bias was detected.\nLimb salvage can be achieved in most end-stage renal disease patients who undergo bypass surgery for critical ischemia, but survival is poor. To avoid early amputation despite a patent graft, bypass grafting should not be offered to patients with a great amount of tissue loss or extensive infection.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to demonstrate improved survival (30-day mortality) after the introduction of an emergency endovascular therapy protocol for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). Numerous authors have successfully demonstrated reduced mortality in patients with rAAA using endovascular techniques. Comparison of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with open repair for rAAA may be misleading, however, because EVAR cannot be performed on all patients, and selection bias may explain the superior performance of any given surgical or endovascular strategy. We developed a model to predict mortality in patients before the introduction of EVAR (preprotocol population), applied this model to predict 30-day mortality among prospective patients (postprotocol population), and compared observed vs expected results.\nWe assessed 126 patients with rAAA. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Potential confounding variables were age, sex, presurgical lowest recorded systolic blood pressure (SBP), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A logistic regression model incorporating significant confounders was used to evaluate changes in 30-day mortality for all patients with rAAA after introduction of the EVAR protocol. Separate logistic regressions were done to compare 30-day mortality for preprotocol vs patients receiving EVAR and preprotocol vs patients receiving postprotocol open repair. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis was used to assess shifts in the performance of the rAAA program over time.\nSignificant confounders were SBP, absence of SBP, and GFR. Logistic regression found evidence of lower mortality after the protocol was introduced, 17.9% vs 30.0% (odds ratio [OR], 0.385; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.141 to 0.981; P = .046). Comparison of all open repairs (preprotocol and postprotocol) and EVAR demonstrated decreased risk for EVAR of 5.0% vs 28.3% (OR, 0.109; 95% CI, 0.013 to 0.906; P = .0084). Unstable patients (SBP <or=80) showed a trend towards improved survival with EVAR relative to open repair (14.3% vs 56.0%, P = .061). Comparison of preprotocol surgery with open repair after the introduction of the protocol found no evidence of a difference between mortality rates for the open procedures-30.0% (preprotocol) vs 25.0% (postprotocol; OR, 0.688; 95% CI, 0.335 to 1.415, P = .3031)-demonstrating that the improved performance observed with CUSUM analysis was related to the introduction of the EVAR protocol.\nOur predictive model using \"weighted\" CUSUM analysis (a measure of performance over time) demonstrated that a predefined strategy of management of rAAA that includes EVAR is associated with improved (P < .05) mortality. Unstable patients with rAAA may be particularly benefited by EVAR and should not be excluded from repair. Appropriate patients with rAAA who are undergoing treatment in experienced vascular centers should be offered EVAR as the treatment of choice.",

    "abstract": "The study assessed the effect on postoperative renal function of left renal vein (LRV) division and reconstruction by direct reanastomosis or graft interposition during infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nBetween January 2001 and March 2006, 1189 patients underwent elective open repair of infrarenal AAAs. LRV division was performed in 15 (1.3%) and its reconstruction in all but one (LRV group), where the LRV was occluded. Patients' glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were retrospectively estimated through postoperative day 4 by using the Cockcroft-Gault equation and compared with the GFRs of 56 controls undergoing AAA repair without LRV division (control group) randomly identified from a prospectively compiled database in a 4:1 ratio. Post hoc 1:1 case-matched analysis was also performed. Statistical analyses were performed as appropriate.\nComparison of demographics and risk factors revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups with the exception of the following: AAAs were larger in LRV group (71.4 +/- 17.1 mm vs 56.0 +/- 14.6 mm; P = .003) and preoperative GFR was lower in LRV group (65.3 +/- 19.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 82.8 +/- 22.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .009). Postoperatively, the trend of GFR with time did not differ between groups (P = .33). The variation of GFR at day 4 after surgery compared with preoperative values was not different either (5.6 +/- 12.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 1.0 +/- 15.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .67). A further 1:1 case-matched multivariate analysis of variance, matching patients and controls by AAA size and preoperative GFR, showed no difference in trend of GFR with time between groups (P = .15). Operative time was not significantly longer in LRV group (148.4 +/- 35.8 minutes vs 131.0 +/- 40.3 minutes; P = .07). No differences between groups were found for blood loss (585.7 +/- 264.2 mL vs 567.7 +/- 222.5 mL; P = .88), perioperative complications (5 vs 8; P = .12), or hospital length of stay (6.2 +/- 1.8 days vs 5.5 +/- 1.2 days; P = .10). A 6-month follow-up of renal function available in 12 patients of LRV group showed no significant decrease in GFR compared with postoperative values (70.8 +/- 24.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 69.1 +/- 23.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .86). At duplex scan, the reconstructed LRV could be insonated in nine of these 12 patients and all were patent.\nLRV division during AAA repair was associated with larger aneurysms and preoperative subclinical renal function impairment. In these patients, LRV reconstruction was associated with the maintenance of preoperative renal functional status without significantly lengthening of operative time or increasing the complications from surgery.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of simvastatin pretreatment in the setting of acute limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in an experimental diabetes model that is associated with a high risk for limb loss.\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into two groups. Diabetes was induced in the first group by intravenous streptozotocin injection. The second group served as the nondiabetic group. Eight weeks after the streptozotocin injection, half of the rats in the diabetic and the nondiabetic groups were further randomized to receive either intraperitoneal simvastatin (1 mg/kg per day) or saline treatment for 6 weeks. Bilateral hind-limb ischemia was induced for 4 hours by the tourniquet method. After 24 hours of reperfusion, tissue samples were collected from the gastrocnemius and anterior tibial muscles bilaterally for measurement of muscle edema, percentage of necrosis, and malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels.\nIschemic injury was more prominent in diabetic animals. The diabetic animals with limb ischemia exhibited a 7% increase in tissue edema, a 47% increase in muscle necrosis and MPO level, and a 15% reduction in glutathione levels compared with the nondiabetic animals (P < .05). Simvastatin treatment with 1 mg/kg for 6 weeks reduced the ischemic injury. Simvastatin pretreatment led to a 71% reduction in muscle necrosis in diabetic animals (P < .001). The protective effects of simvastatin pretreatment also correlated with a 23% improvement in tissue edema, a 75% reduction in tissue myeloperoxidase content, and a 71% increase in glutathione levels in diabetic animals (P < .01). Furthermore, skeletal muscle injury, characterized by tissue edema and leucosequestration, was significantly less severe with simvastatin pretreatment compared with the nondiabetic animals (P < .01).\nSimvastatin pretreatment reduced limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic and nondiabetic animals. We conclude that simvastatin pretreatment may be a potential therapeutic intervention for skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury in the clinical setting.",

All patients who underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair with coverage of the celiac artery origin were identified and retrospectively analyzed. End points for evaluation included indications for covering the celiac artery, anatomic features of the distal landing zone, demonstration of collateral circulation between the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery, technical success of the procedure, and presence of clinical ischemic symptoms after the procedure.\nBetween March 2005 and May 2006, 46 patients underwent endovascular repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. Seven patients had planned celiac artery coverage with a thoracic stent graft to secure an adequate distal sealing zone. Six patients demonstrated collateral circulation through the gastroduodenal artery between the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries before deployment of the stent graft. One patient had a distal type I endoleak at the conclusion of the procedure related to inadequate sealing at the superior mesenteric artery origin. No type II endoleaks were evident at the final intraoperative angiogram or 30-day computed tomography scan. There were no postoperative deaths, no ischemic abdominal complications, and no clinical spinal cord ischemia.

Routine patient follow-up included computed tomography scans and abdominal plain films at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery and yearly thereafter. Although patients were specifically instructed not to undergo MRI, retrospective review identified 22 patients (4%) who underwent MRI after stent-graft implantation.\nSeventeen of 22 patients consented to have their records reviewed as part of this study and underwent MRI at a mean interval of 669 days (range, 3-2179 days) after stent-graft implantation. Eleven patients underwent implantation of Zenith bifurcated stent grafts, and six had custom-made uni-iliac stent grafts. These patients underwent a total of 20 MRI studies-10 of the brain/neck and 10 of the abdomen, pelvis, or spine. In all cases, the magnetic field strength was 1.5 T or less. No patient experienced any symptoms of abdominal or back pain during or after the MRI. Comparison of the pre- and post-MRI computed tomography scans (available in 15 of 17 patients) and abdominal radiographs showed no change in stent-graft structure, position, or function in any of these patients and no increase in abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter in any patient at an average of 899 days after MRI.\nOn the basis of this limited experience, MRI has no discernible effect on the structure, position, or function of stainless-steel Z-stent-based abdominal aortic prostheses.",

    "abstract": "This report analyzes the safety and efficacy of carbon dioxide digital subtraction angiography (CO(2)-DSA) for EVAR in a group of patients with renal insufficiency compared with a concurrent group of patients with normal renal function undergoing EVAR with iodinated contrast angiography (ICA).\nBetween 2003 and 2005, 100 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR using ICA, CO(2)-DSA, or both were retrospectively reviewed, and preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, and follow-up variables were collected. Patients were divided into two groups depending on renal function and contrast used. Group I comprised patients with normal renal function in whom ICA was used exclusively, and group II patients had a serum creatinine >or=1.5 mg/dL, and CO(2)-DSA was used preferentially and supplemented with ICA, when necessary. The two groups were compared for the outcomes of successful graft placement, renal function, endoleak type, and frequency, and the need for graft revision. Comparisons were made using chi(2) analysis, Student t test, and the Fisher exact test.\nA total of 84 EVARs were performed in group I and 16 in group II. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between groups with the exception of serum creatinine, which was significantly increased in group II (1.8 mg/dL vs 1.0 mg/dL P < .0005). All 100 endografts were successfully implanted. Patients in group II had longer fluoroscopy times, longer operative times, and increased radiation exposure, and 13 of 16 patients required supplemental ICA. Mean iodinated contrast use was 27 mL for group II vs 148 mL in group I (P < .0005). Mean postoperative serum creatinine was unchanged from baseline, and 30-day morbidity was similar for both groups. No patient required dialysis. No patients died. Perioperatively, and at 1 and 6 months, the endoleak type and incidence and need for endograft revision was no different between groups.\nCO(2)-DSA is safe, can be used to guide EVAR, and provides outcomes similar to ICA-guided EVAR. CO2-DSA protects renal function in the azotemic patient by lessening the need for iodinated contrast and associated nephrotoxicity, but with the tradeoff of longer fluoroscopy and operating room times and increased radiation exposure.",

    "abstract": "Infected femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (IFAP) is a severe complication in parenteral drug abusers, with difficult and controversial management. Ligation alone without revascularization is frequently associated with later intermittent claudication and limb amputation. Furthermore, arterial reconstruction with a synthetic or venous conduit is limited because of a contaminated field and, often, unavailability of autologous venous grafts. In this study, we present our experience with the internal iliac artery (IIA) as a graft for arterial reconstruction after IFAP excision in these patients.\nData of 14 consecutive patients who presented with IFAP secondary to parenteral drug abuse from 2001 to 2005 were analyzed. Twelve patients (85.7%) were male. The median age was 27 years (range, 19-42 years). In 13 cases, the IFAP involved the common femoral artery, and in 1 case it involved the profunda femoris artery (PFA). In nine patients, we used the IIA for arterial reconstruction (five as a patch and four as an interposition graft), whereas in two patients the arterial deficit was repaired with a great saphenous vein patch. In two cases, an extra-anatomic bypass with a synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene graft was performed. In one patient, the pseudoaneurysm involved the PFA and was treated with excision and ligation of the PFA.\nAll nine patients who underwent revascularization with the use of IIA were free of claudication symptoms. None of them experienced any perioperative complications, had signs of reinfection, or required limb amputation during the follow-up period (median, 19 months; range, 4-52 months). Regarding the remaining five patients, one died 25 days after surgery because of multiorgan failure, and one underwent reoperation because of proximal anastomotic rupture of a synthetic graft. The latter patient finally underwent a transmetatarsal amputation.\nThe use of IIA for arterial reconstruction after IFAP excision in drug abusers is safe and effective. These preliminary results indicate that the implementation of this technique offers many advantages compared with traditional treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Endograft repair holds considerable promise in the treatment of traumatic disruption of the thoracic aorta because patients often have multiple coexisting injuries further complicating traditional open repair. In addition, patients are often young, with an aortic anatomy dissimilar to those with atherosclerotic aneurysms. As a result, techniques for endograft repair have to be refined accordingly.\nThe records of 20 consecutive cases of traumatic aortic disruption treated by endograft repair at a single institution were reviewed.\nMean patient age was 40 years (range, 17 to 88 years), and 17 (85%) of 20 patients were men. All cases were completed. There were no procedure related deaths, but four (20%) patients died of their co-injuries. Only two (10%) of 20 required a graft >28 mm in diameter, and nine (45%) aortas were small enough to require use of 23-mm abdominal cuffs. Six (30%) of 20 cases required complete or partial coverage of the left subclavian artery. Placement of a proximal extension was required in one patient for a type I endoleak. A graft collapse occurred in one patient that required surgical removal and aortic repair.\nEndovascular repair of traumatic aortic disruption can be accomplished in most cases. Compared with atherosclerotic aneurysms, the proximal thoracic aorta tends to be smaller and the arch angle tighter in an aorta 19mm in diameter. This frequently necessitates the use of smaller devices and less stiff wires. Surgeons should be prepared to cover the left subclavian artery if needed, have a wide range of device sizes in stock to avoid over-sizing, and show restraint if the anatomy appears unsuitable.",

    "abstract": "Injuries to the abdominal aorta are rare and remain one of the most lethal causes of early death in trauma. The purposes of this study were to identify primary predictors of mortality and to examine the impact of a well-established operating room resuscitation protocol on survival in patients with traumatic aortic injury.\nA 20-year retrospective review was performed of medical records and autopsy reports of trauma patients admitted with confirmed injury to the abdominal aorta. Data on patient demographics, admission characteristics, operative findings, and the initial location of resuscitation were collected. The main outcome measure was death.\nAbdominal aortic injuries were diagnosed in 60 patients. Their average age was 26.5 years, and the mean transport time was 10 minutes. The overall mortality rate (MR) was 73%. With the exclusion of 18 patients considered dead on arrival, the MR decreased to 61%. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 20% (MR 92%) and penetrating in 80% (MR 68%). Acidosis, defined as a pH <7.2 (MR 81%) or a base deficit >10 (MR 77%), was a predictor of death (P < .0001). Patients resuscitated directly in the operating room had a significantly lower MR (40%) than those resuscitated in the trauma room (MR 78%; P < .02). The lack of retroperitoneal tamponade (P < .02), the presence of associated intra-abdominal injuries (P < .001), and the location of aortic injury at the subdiaphragmatic (18%; MR 90%) or suprarenal location (37%; MR 71%; P < .005) at exploration resulted in significantly higher patient mortality. Surgical management consisted of primary repair in 26, end-to-end repair in 1, interposition graft in 8, or patch in 1. Resuscitative thoracotomy was performed in 27 patients (45%), with an overall MR of 92%.\nDespite advances in fluid resuscitation, operative strategy, and transport during the past 20 years, the mortality of traumatic injury to the abdominal aorta remains high. Shock, acidosis, suprarenal aortic injury, and a lack of retroperitoneal tamponade all independently contribute to mortality and should raise the suspicion for a potentially lethal aortic injury in a severely injured patient. Rapid identification and resuscitation in the operating room may therefore be the only factors to improve current survival rates in such devastating injuries.",

    "abstract": "The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the infrapopliteal arterial segment is not well defined. This study evaluated the clinical utility and diagnostic accuracy of time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) MRA compared with digital subtraction contrast angiography (DSA) in planning for percutaneous interventions of popliteal and infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease.\nPatients who underwent percutaneous lower extremity interventions for popliteal or tibial occlusive disease were identified for this study. Preprocedural TRICKS MRA was performed with 1.5 Tesla (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wis) magnetic resonance imaging scanners with a flexible peripheral vascular coil, using the TRICKS technique with gadodiamide injection. DSA was performed using standard techniques in angiography suite with a 15-inch image intensifier. DSA was considered the gold standard. The MRA and DSA were then evaluated in a blinded fashion by a radiologist and a vascular surgeon. The popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk were evaluated separately, and the tibial arteries were divided into proximal, mid, and distal segments. Each segment was interpreted as normal (0% to 49% stenosis), stenotic (50% to 99% stenosis), or occluded (100%). Lesion morphology was classified according to the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC). We calculated concordance between the imaging studies and the sensitivity and specificity of MRA. The clinical utility of MRA was also assessed in terms of identifying arterial access site as well as predicting technical success of the percutaneous treatment.\nComparisons were done on 150 arterial segments in 30 limbs of 27 patients. When evaluated by TASC classification, TRICKS MRA correlated with DSA in 83% of the popliteal and in 88% of the infrapopliteal segments. MRA correctly identified significant disease of the popliteal artery with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 92%, and of the tibial arteries with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 84%. When used to evaluate for stenosis vs occlusion, MRA interpretation agreed with DSA 90% of the time. Disagreement occurred in 15 arterial segments, most commonly in distal tibioperoneal arteries. MRA misdiagnosed occlusion for stenosis in 11 of 15 segments, and stenosis for occlusion in four of 15 segments. Arterial access was accurately planned based on preprocedural MRA findings in 29 of 30 patients. MRA predicted technical success 83% of the time. Five technical failures were due to inability to cross arterial occlusions, all accurately identified by MRA.\nTRICKS MRA is an accurate method of evaluating patients for popliteal and infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease and can be used for planning percutaneous interventions.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA] with stenting) has been increasingly applied in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) to avoid morbidities associated with open repair (OR). The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of PTA/Stent vs OR in patients with symptomatic CMI.\nDuring the interval of January 1991 to December 2005, 80 consecutive patients presenting with symptomatic CMI underwent elective revascularization. Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia or those with mesenteric revascularization performed as part of complex aneurysm repair were excluded. PTA/Stent (with stenting in 87%) was the initial procedure in 31 patients (42 vessels). OR was performed in 49 patients (88 vessels) and consisted of bypass grafting in 31 (63%), transaortic endarterectomy in 7 (14%), patch angioplasty in 4 (8%), or combined in 7 (15%). Mean follow-up was 15 months in the PTA/Stent group and 42 months in the OR cohort. Study end points included perioperative morbidity, mortality, late survival (Kaplan-Meier), and symptomatic and radiographic recurrence.\nBaseline comorbidities, with the exception of heart disease (P=.025) and serum albumin<3.5 g/dL (P=.025), were similar between PTA/Stent and OR patients. The PTA/Stent group had fewer vessels revascularized (1.5 vs 1.8 vessels, P=.001). Hospital length of stay was less for the PTA/Stent group (5.6 vs 16.7 days, P=.001). No difference was noted in in-hospital major morbidity (4/31 vs 2/49, P=.23) or mortality (1/31 vs 1/49, P=.74). Actuarial survival at 2 years was similar between the groups (88% PTA/Stent vs 74% OR, P=.28). There was no difference in the incidence of symptomatic (7/31 [23%] vs 11/49 [22%], P=.98) or radiographic recurrence (10/31 [32%] vs 18/49 [37%], P=.40) between the two groups. Radiographic primary patency (58% vs 90%, P=.001) and primary assisted patency (65% vs 96%, P<.001) at 1 year were lower in the PTA/Stent group compared with OR. Five (16%) of 31 PTA/Stent patients compared with 11 (22%) of 49 OR patients required a second intervention on at least one index vessel at any time (P=.49).\nSymptomatic recurrence requiring reintervention is common (overall 16/80 [20%]) after open and endovascular treatment for CMI. PTA/Stent was associated with decreased primary patency, primary assisted patency, and the need for earlier reintervention. In-hospital mortality or major morbidity were similar in patients undergoing PTA/Stent and OR. These findings suggest that OR and PTA/Stent should be applied selectively in CMI patients in accordance with individual patient anatomic and comorbidity considerations.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of wearing compression stockings on clinical vessel disappearance following sclerotherapy of telangiectasias and reticular veins has been a matter of debate for half a century.\nTo determine the relative efficacy of compression following sclerotherapy and to determine its impact on general quality of life in a prospective randomized open-label trial.\nFemale patients seeking treatment of telangiectasias and reticular veins and presenting comparable areas of telangiectasias on the lateral aspect of the thigh (C1AorSEPAS1PN) were randomized to wear medical compression stockings (23 to 32 mm Hg) daily for 3 weeks or no such treatment following a single session of standardized liquid sclerotherapy. Outcome was assessed by patient satisfaction analysis and quantitative evaluation of photographs taken from the lateral aspect of the thigh before and again at 52 days on the average after sclerotherapy by two blinded expert reviewers. Patients completed a quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) before treatment and again at the control.\nData of 96 of 100 randomized patients could be evaluated. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of treatment was similar in the two groups. Objective assessment of clinical vessel disappearance revealed a benefit of wearing stockings (P=.026) corresponding to a NNT (number needed to treat) of 4.7 patients to get a vessel disappearance score higher than 6. The interobserver agreement was very high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.93). Compression was well tolerated with a low rate of discomfort claims (mean 17.5%).

Dysregulation of MMP activity has been associated with common vascular diseases such as atherosclerotic plaque formation, abdominal aortic aneurysms, and critical limb ischemia. For this reason, MMPs have become an important focus for basic science studies and clinical investigations by vascular biology researchers. This article reviews the recent literature, summarizing our current understanding of the role of MMPs in the pathogenesis of various peripheral vascular disease states. In addition, the importance of MMPs in the future diagnosis and treatment of peripheral vascular disease is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery has relied upon the pool of general surgical residents for candidates for residency. This has significantly limited the pool of applicants. With the advent of new primary certificate training paradigms, we investigated factors that might alter the career choices for women medical students. A Web-based survey was conducted of third-year and fourth-year medical students at three university-affiliated programs. A total of 140 students completed the survey, which identified the third year of medical school as the primary year when students committed to a final career choice. Lifestyle issues were the primary deterrents, with long work hours and lack of time to see family negatively influencing students' interest in surgery. Eliminating the need for 5 years of general surgery and the opportunity for part-time training were cited as factors that would alter students' decisions to pursue vascular surgery. Ultimately, a positive rotation experience, lifestyle issues, and mentors impacted on final career decisions. To attract the best applicants to the field, we need to continue to be active in mentoring students and exploring alternative training paths and eventual career practices.",

FDG-PET is an established imaging tool in oncology but has also been used in infectious and inflammatory diseases. PET combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) shows the metabolic activity with precise anatomic localization. More than 2000 scanners have now been installed worldwide, and with better availability, this hybrid method has the potential to become an important imaging tool in the management of suspected aortic graft infections, especially in patients with low-grade graft infection. We report a patient with a suspected aortic graft infection that was confirmed and anatomically localized by FDG-PET/CT. An extra-anatomic bypass and extirpation of the aortic graft was performed. The perioperative location of the graft infection coincided exactly with the place of FDG uptake shown on PET/CT. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and did well during 6 months of follow-up.",

This study examined the long-term results (6 months) after implantation of phosphorylcholine-coated balloon-expandable stents in a porcine model of experimental in-stent coronary and peripheral arterial restenosis.\nForty-eight stainless steel-tantalum-stainless steel composite balloon-expandable stents coated with phosphorylcholine (TriMaxx stent, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill) were implanted in the coronary (3.0 x 15 mm) or larger femoral arteries (4.0 x 38 mm) of Yorkshire crossbred swine to achieve a 1.1:1 stent-to-artery ratio. After 28, 90, or 180 days, the arteries were excised, perfusion-fixed at 100 mm Hg, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphometric evaluation.\nOne animal did not survive to euthanasia; all arteries in surviving animals were patent. No significant differences were found in mean injury or inflammation scores among the groups or time points. The larger femoral arteries generated more neointimal area over time than the coronary arteries. The neointimal area in coronary arteries was 2.76 +/- 0.71, 1.75 +/- 0.42, and 1.83 +/- 0.19 mm(2) at 28, 90, and 180 days, respectively, and 5.20 +/- 0.97, 3.11 +/- 0.53, and 5.10 +/- 0.80 mm(2) in the femoral arteries (P < .05 coronary vs femoral at 180 days). This led to statistically significantly increased percent area stenosis at 180 days (coronary 27% +/- 4% vs femoral 45% +/- 5%; P < .05).\nThe vascular response to balloon-expandable stenting in the coronary and peripheral circulations is different. After 6 months, neointimal hyperplasia and stent-induced stenosis were increased in peripheral porcine arteries compared with coronary arteries.",

At 3 weeks after transplantation, the grafted site of the inferior vena cava was exposed and videotaped, and then processed for histology.\nDistinct rhythmic beating of the vena cava at the site of cell injection (at a rate lower than aortic beating) was observed in all six rats treated with neonatal cardiomyocyte injections, but in none of the six that received the medium. The vena cava continued to beat spontaneously and rhythmically after the aortas were clamped and after the heart was excised. The beating was manifest by visual contraction and relaxation of the vessel wall. The spontaneous beating rate was 101 +/- 7 beats/min at 1 to 3 minutes after excision of the heart. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed viable grafts in the wall of the vena cava in all that were implanted with neonatal cardiac cells; but in none of the vena cava that received the medium. Neonatal cardiomyocytes in the graft matured with cross striations and stained positive for the muscle marker sarcomeric actin.\nThe present study demonstrates that neonatal cardiomyocytes survive, mature, and spontaneously and rhythmically contract when implanted in the wall of a vein.",

    "abstract": "Venous dilatation and wall thickening are part of the maturation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, the underlying mechanism of AVF remodeling remains unknown. We therefore studied whether matrix remodeling elicited by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may contribute to AVF maturation.\nA femoral AVF model in rats was established by invagination of the distal end of the left femoral artery into the femoral vein after venotomy (fistula group). In the sham group, the left femoral artery was cut, but venous invagination was not performed. Changes in the hemodynamics and the diameter of the iliac vein were studied on days 3, 14, and 28, then the iliac vein was removed and examined for changes in wall thickness and expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, type 4 tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-4), and collagen I and III by immunohistochemical staining or Western blotting.\nFemoral AVF resulted in a sixfold increase in blood flow in the fistula iliac vein and a gradual, but significant, increase in the thickness of the intima and media and marked up-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, down-regulation of TIMP-4, as well as degradation of collagens I and III. The collagen I/III ratio was significantly higher in the 14-day fistula group (1.44 +/- 0.32) than in the sham group (0.82 +/- 0.15) and was even higher in the 28-day fistula group (1.76 +/- 0.21).\nThe present results confirmed our hypothesis that a high blood flow rate in the fistula vein affects the expression of MMPs and TIMP-4, resulting in the remodeling or maturation of the AVF. Remodeling is associated with degradation of collagen, with an increase in the collagen I/III ratio.",

    "abstract": "Retrievable vena cava filters (R-VCF) are a recent addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the prevention of pulmonary embolism. However, unlike permanent vena cava filters (P-VCF), outcomes data are limited regarding complication rates.\nThis was a retrospective comparative analysis of consecutive patients undergoing placement of R-VCF vs P-VCF at Wake Forest University School of Medicine from January 2000 to December 2004. Data collected included demographics, procedural specifics, filter type, indications, and complications. Summary data are expressed as number (percentage) or mean +/- SD. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed by using t and Fisher exact testing, as appropriate. Four additional patients with vena cava thrombosis were also referred to our institution for treatment during the study period, all with opposed biconical VCFs (OptEase and TrapEase filters) recently placed at other facilities. This last group of patients is described but not included in the analysis.\nA total of 189 VCF (165 P-VCF and 24 R-VCF) cases were examined. No significant differences in VCF groups were observed according to age, documented hypercoagulability, or concomitant anticoagulation. Significant differences were observed according to sex (30.3% of P-VCF vs 62.5% of R-VCF patients were female), morbid obesity (4.2% of P-VCF vs 25% of R-VCF patients), active malignancy (20% of P-VCF vs 41.7% of R-VCF patients), and indication for VCF placement. Over a median follow-up of 8.5 months, no case of significant hemorrhage, no VCF migration, and four cases of vena cava thrombosis were observed. Vena cava thrombosis was observed more frequently in the presence of R-VCF when compared with P-VCF (12.5% vs 0.6%; P = .007). All observed vena cava thromboses were associated with severe clinical symptoms and occurred in patients who received opposed biconical VCF designs.\nIn our experience, both P-VCF and R-VCF can be placed safely. Among both permanent and retrievable devices, however, opposed biconical designs seem to be associated with an increased risk for vena cava thrombosis. Although causative factors remain unclear, filter design and resultant flow dynamics may play an important role, because all episodes of vena cava thrombosis occurred in patients with a single-filter design.",

The indications and safety profile for placement of preoperative retrievable vena cava filters (rVCFs) remains undefined, however. This study sought to determine the safety, feasibility, and outcome of rVCFs in bariatric surgery patients, who are known as a high-risk population for periprocedural deep vein thrombus (DVT) or pulmonary embolus, or both.\nBetween June 1, 2004, and October 1, 2005, protocols were developed and implemented at a tertiary referral hospital for placement of rVCFs in 59 consecutive high-risk patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass or duodenal switch if they met any of the following criteria: body mass index >55 kg/m(2), hypercoagulable state, severe immobility, venous stasis, or previous history of DVT or pulmonary embolus. Using both Site-Rite (Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, Utah) ultrasound and fluoroscopy, G\u00fcnther Tulip (Cook, Inc., Bloomington, Ind) rVCFs were placed immediately after general anesthesia, just preceding the bariatric procedure. The internal jugular vein was the preferred approach, followed by the femoral vein. Retrieval was performed after the fourth postoperative week.\nDuring a 16-month period, 60 rVCFs were placed in 61 attempts, 57 through the internal jugular vein and three through the femoral vein. Six patients refused the retrieval attempt. Of the remaining 54 rVCFs, the primary retrieval success was 90% (49/54), with all failures due to severe filter tilt. The secondary retrieval success was 100% (3/3). The two remaining patients refused secondary retrieval attempt. The mean +/- standard deviation dwell time of the rVCFs was 63 +/- 30 days. No procedure complications occurred in placement or retrieval. One patient developed a clinical pulmonary embolism with the filter in place while not receiving postoperative anticoagulation. No patients died. The mean body mass index of the patients was 61 +/- 10 kg/m(2).\nPlacement and retrieval of retrievable vena cava filters in high-risk bariatric surgery patients is safe, feasible, and offers potential clinical benefit to patients requiring short-term protection from pulmonary embolism.",

    "abstract": "Central (superior vena cava, brachiocephalic, or subclavian) venous stenoses are a major impediment to long-term arteriovenous access in the upper extremities. The optimal management of these stenoses is still undecided. The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of primary angioplasty (PTA) vs primary stenting (PTS) in a dialysis access population at a tertiary referral academic medical center.\nA database of consecutive hemodialysis patients undergoing endovascular treatment for central venous stenosis was developed for the period 1995 through 2003. This database was retrospectively reviewed. Vessels exposed to either primary high-pressure balloon angioplasty or primary stenting were examined. Vessels undergoing stenting after failed or suboptimal angioplasty were defined as failures at the time of stenting despite the potential continued patency upon completion of stenting. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed for time-dependent variables. Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation where appropriate.\nPTS was used to treat 26 patients (35% male; average age, 57 +/- 15 years) with 26 central venous stenoses, and 47 patients (45% male; average age, 57 +/- 18 years) with 49 central venous stenoses were treated with PTA. The PTS group underwent 71 percutaneous interventions per stenosis (average, 2.7 +/- 2.4 interventions), and the PTA group underwent 98 interventions per stenosis (average, 2.0 +/- 1.6 interventions). The PTS group hemodialysis access site was an average of 1.0 +/- 1.3 years old at the time of the initial intervention, and the hemodialysis access in the PTA group was an average of 1.1 +/- 1.2 years old. Primary patency was equivalent between groups by Kaplan-Meier analysis, with 30-day rates of 76% for both groups and 12-month rates of 29% for PTA and 21% for PTS (P = .48). Assisted primary patency was also equivalent (P = .08), with a 30-day patency rate of 81% and 12-month rate of 73% for the PTA group, vs PTS assisted patency rates of 84% at 30 days, and 46% at 12 months. Ipsilateral hemodialysis access survival was equivalent between groups.\nEndovascular therapy with PTA or PTS for central venous stenosis is safe, with low rates of technical failure. Multiple additional interventions are the rule with both treatments. Although neither offers truly durable outcomes, PTS does not improve on the patency rates more than PTA and does not add to the longevity of ipsilateral hemodialysis access sites.",

The PTS group underwent 71 percutaneous interventions per stenosis (average, 2.7 +/- 2.4 interventions), and the PTA group underwent 98 interventions per stenosis (average, 2.0 +/- 1.6 interventions). The PTS group hemodialysis access site was an average of 1.0 +/- 1.3 years old at the time of the initial intervention, and the hemodialysis access in the PTA group was an average of 1.1 +/- 1.2 years old. Primary patency was equivalent between groups by Kaplan-Meier analysis, with 30-day rates of 76% for both groups and 12-month rates of 29% for PTA and 21% for PTS (P = .48). Assisted primary patency was also equivalent (P = .08), with a 30-day patency rate of 81% and 12-month rate of 73% for the PTA group, vs PTS assisted patency rates of 84% at 30 days, and 46% at 12 months.

    "abstract": "Iliac angioplasty in preparation for an infrainguinal bypass graft has been shown to be an effective strategy. We undertook this study to determine if superficial femoral artery (SFA) angioplasty offers durable inflow for distal origin grafts originating from the SFA or popliteal artery.\nAll distal origin grafts performed at a single institution between 1988 and 2006, </=30 days of an ipsilateral SFA percutaneous intervention, were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were identified from a computerized vascular registry, and data were obtained by review of patient charts, angiograms, and duplex studies.\nWe identified 23 autogenous distal origin grafts procedures performed distal to an SFA intervention, of which 22 were performed for critical limb ischemia (96%). The SFA lesions intervened on (20 angioplasty alone, 3 angioplasty with stenting) included 11 TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) A (48%), seven TASC B (30%), five TASC C (22%), and no TASC D (0%). Of the bypasses, five originated from the distal SFA, five originated from the above knee popliteal artery, and 13 originated from the below knee popliteal artery. A significant majority of the patients (87%) were diabetic. No deaths, amputations, or early graft failures occurred during the perioperative period. The mean duration of follow-up was 40.8 months. By life-table analysis, the primary patency rate was 58% at 5 years. The primary assisted patency rate was 69% at 5 years. Of the seven interventions required to maintain patency, only one targeted the SFA. None of the graft failures could be specifically attributed to disease progression of the SFA. The 5-year limb salvage rate was 70% and the survival rate was 65%.\nPercutaneous SFA intervention in preparation for a distal origin graft is a useful and effective strategy in select patients. The durability appears comparable with distal origin grafts performed in the absence of an SFA intervention. This strategy provides a good option in the setting of both atherosclerotic SFA disease and limited autogenous conduit.",

    "abstract": "Acutely ischemic limbs are often of uncertain viability. To assist operative management, this study determined prospectively which indicators on admission were the best predictors of major amputation and, conversely, limb preservation.\nData were collected on admission. Presenting complaint, history, clinical assessment, and blood test results, including creatine kinase (CK), were recorded. Surgical procedures were noted-in particular, the presence or absence of major amputation by death or discharge. The setting was a tertiary vascular referral center in a university teaching hospital. Subjects included all patients referred as emergency cases to the vascular unit over an 18-month period who were admitted for inpatient management with acute lower limb ischemia. The main outcome measure was major amputation.\nA total of 97 patients with acute ischemia were studied prospectively (51 men and 46 women). Twenty-one patients (21.6%) underwent major amputation. Previous vascular surgery (P = .012), mottling (P = .001), sensory loss (P = .003), motor loss (P = .001), muscle tenderness (P < .001), absent ankle Doppler signals (P = .008), neutrophilia (P = .011), and increased CK (P < .001) were significantly associated with major amputation. If CK was normal, the risk of major amputation was 4.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-9.7%). If CK was increased, the risk was 56.2% (95% CI, 39.1%-73.4%).\nSpecific clinical findings were significantly associated with major amputation. Of these, only CK had a positive predictive value greater than 50%. Plasma CK can assist operative management of acute lower limb ischemia by quantifying prospectively the risk of major amputation or limb preservation on admission.",

Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed.\nForty patients with renal artery stenosis were evaluated for renal artery stenting, of these 22 were followed up with medical management. Twenty-six renal artery stents were placed in 18 patients (mean age, 70 +/- 8 years), of whom 76% were treated for multidrug resistant hypertension, and 24% were treated for renal salvage. Mean follow-up was 15 months. Patients experienced a significant reduction in hypertension and in the number of antihypertensive agents, but this significance deteriorated at 6 months, when their blood pressure and number of medications returned to preprocedural values. Compared with a cohort that was followed up with medical management, the rate of renal function decline improved from -0.08 mg/dL per month to 0.00 mg/dL per month (P < .05) after intervention. Patients with baseline chronic renal insufficiency experienced the greatest benefit from renal artery stenting.\nRenal artery stenting initially improves hypertension control, but the durability is lost after 6 months. Renal artery stenting dramatically slows the rate of renal function decline and could potentially delay a patient's requirement for hemodialysis.",

There were 144 (40%) asymptomatic limbs (group 1), 140 (39%) had chronic symptoms (group 2), and 74 (21%) had acute ischemia (group 3). Great saphenous vein (GSV) was used in 242 limbs (68%), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 94 (26%), and other types of graft in 22 (6%). Early mortality was 1% (3/358), all in group 3 (4% [3/74]). Six of seven patients with perioperative myocardial infarctions belonged to group 3 (8%). The 30-day graft thrombosis rate was 4%, with 1% in group 1 (1/144), 4% in group 2 (5/140), and 9% in group 3 (7/74).

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with vascular disease in many epidemiologic studies, but only a few have reported on the relation between hyperhomocysteinemia and aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (AAAs). Although these studies showed higher homocysteine concentrations in patients with AAA than in controls, little attention had been given to possible confounding factors. Most patients with AAA are of older age, have an impaired renal function, and have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This matched case-control study investigated the relation between homocysteine concentration (before and after methionine loading) and AAA, taking into account possible confounders such as age, sex, and concentrations of creatinine and B vitamins.\nPatients with a history of AAA were recruited from the outpatient clinic; 60% had already undergone surgery for their AAA. They were asked to invite a friend or neighbor to participate as a control subject (age-matched and sex-matched). Concentrations of homocysteine, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate, and creatinine were determined in the fasting state, and blood was taken for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation analysis. Six hours after oral methionine loading, the postmethionine load homocysteine concentration was determined.\nUnivariate analysis showed an odds ratio (OR) of 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9 to 5.5) for the risk of AAA for the highest quartile of homocysteine concentration. After adjustment for creatinine, the OR was markedly reduced to 1.24 (95% CI, 0.42 to 3.66), and this risk further attenuated in the multivariate analysis. Univariate analysis of the B vitamins showed an increased risk of AAA for the bottom quartile of vitamin B6 (OR, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.22 to 11.54), which even increased after adjustments. The relative risk associated with the MTHFR 677TT polymorphism was 2.1 (95% CI, 0.9 to 5.3).\nVitamin B6, but not homocysteine, is an independent risk factor for AAA. The role of vitamin B6 in the pathogenesis of AAA needs to be further elucidated.",

    "abstract": "The effect of suprarenal stent fixation during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) on renal function remains unclear. A unique validated three-dimensional intraluminal imaging technique was used to analyze the effect of suprarenal stent position relative to renal artery orifices. Also analyzed was its medium-term to long-term effects on renal function.\nThe study cohort comprised 29 of 34 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR with the Zenith endograft system from September 1999 to March 2002 at a single institution. The precise locations of the uncovered suprarenal stent struts were assessed by a virtual endoscopic imaging technique. Anatomic and quantitative categorization of patients was made according to the configuration of uncovered stent struts across the renal artery ostia (RAO). The anatomic subgroups were defined as struts located centrally or peripherally across both RAO. The quantitative subgroups were defined as RAO crossed by multiple struts, a solitary strut, or no struts. The subgroups were compared for their renal function, as assessed by temporal measurements of serum creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance, and renal parenchymal perfusion defects, as assessed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT).\nMean follow-up was 52.7 months. Separate subgroup analysis for both anatomic and quantitative configurations did not demonstrate any significant difference in renal function between the different strut permutations (P > .05). Follow-up imaging confirmed one case of renal infarction secondary to an occluded accessory renal artery, although this patient had normal serum creatinine levels.\nRAO coverage by suprarenal uncovered stents does not appear to have a significant effect on renal function as evaluated by creatinine measurements in patients with normal preoperative renal function.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of open repair for ruptured descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (RDTAA).\nA retrospective review identified 41 consecutive cases of open surgical repair in 40 patients presenting with nontraumatic, atherosclerotic RDTAA from 1996 to 2006. Patients with traumatic injuries or complicated dissections were excluded. Patient characteristics and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were collected from the medical record. Univariate and logistic regression were used to identify factors contributing to mortality and morbidity in these patients.\nThe operative mortality rate was 26.8% (11/41). All but two deaths occurred within 24 hours of operation; seven were intraoperative. Overall actuarial survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 53.7% and 47.1%, respectively. For those who survived to hospital discharge, the respective numbers were 73.3% and 64.4%. Intraoperative hypotension and blood transfusion requirements were independent predictors of perioperative death. Octogenarians had a mortality rate equivalent to that of the younger population (25% vs 27.6%; not significant). There was a strong trend toward an improved outcome in the latter part (2003-2006) compared with the first part (1995-2002; 13.6% vs 42.1%, respectively; P = .075).\nDirect open repair for RDTAA can be achieved with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates even in elderly patients. Improved outcome can be expected with increased volume and experience. This series should help establish a reference against which the results of endovascular endeavors and hybrid procedures could be compared.",

    "abstract": "The Heart Protection Study (HPS) provides an opportunity to assess directly the effects of cholesterol-lowering therapy on major vascular events (defined as myocardial infarction, coronary death, stroke, or revascularization) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In addition, the effects on peripheral vascular events (ie, non-coronary revascularization, aneurysm repairs, major amputations or PAD deaths) can be assessed.\n6748 UK adults with PAD and 13,788 other high-risk participants were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo, yielding an average LDL cholesterol difference of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during a mean of 5 years.\nFor participants with PAD, allocation to simvastatin was associated with a highly significant 22% (95% CI 15-29) relative reduction in the rate of first major vascular event following randomisation (895 [26.4%] simvastatin-allocated vs 1101 [32.7%] placebo-allocated; P < .0001), which was similar to that seen among the other high-risk participants. The absolute reduction in first major vascular event was 63 (SE 11) per 1000 patients with PAD and 50 (SE 7) per 1000 without pre-existing PAD. Overall, among all participants, there was a 16% (5-25) relative reduction in the rate of first peripheral vascular event following randomisation (479 [4.7%] simvastatin vs 561 [5.5%] placebo), largely irrespective of baseline LDL cholesterol and other factors. This effect chiefly reflects a 20% (8-31) relative reduction in non-coronary revascularization procedures (334 [3.3%] vs 415 [4.0%]; P = .002).\nHPS demonstrates the benefits of cholesterol-lowering statin therapy in patients with PAD, regardless of their presenting cholesterol levels and other presenting features. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduces the rate of first major vascular events by about one-quarter, and that of peripheral vascular events by about one-sixth, with large absolute benefits seen in participants with PAD because of their high vascular risk.

    "abstract": "We sought to define the current anatomic barriers to thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) stent grafting to guide future device development.\nAll patients presenting with TAA requiring repair were evaluated for endovascular repair during a 4-year period (2000 to 2004). The TAAs evaluated were those beginning distal to the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and ending proximal to the celiac artery. All patients in whom endovascular repair was indicated underwent cross-sectional imaging by computed tomography angiography and three-dimensional modeling of their thoracic and abdominal arterial anatomy. Patients were evaluated for endovascular TAA repair in the context of the inclusion/exclusion criteria of pivotal United States Food and Drug Administration trials of the Gore TAG and Medtronic Talent devices. Anatomic requirements included >or=20 mm of suitable proximal and distal neck length, and proximal and distal neck diameters of 20 to 42 mm. These trials allowed the use of femoral or iliac access, including the use of conduits, and permitted stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) after preliminary carotid-subclavian bypass. Patients rejected for medical reasons or who died during evaluation were not included in the review.\nA total of 126 patients (73 men, 53 women) with TAA located between the LCCA and celiac artery were screened for endovascular repair, and 33 (26%) were rejected for anatomic reasons. The remaining 93 patients underwent endografting (59 Talent, 34 TAG). Rejection was not significantly different by gender (16/73 men, 17/53 women, P = .22, NS). Most patients (28/33) were rejected for more than one criterion. Hostile proximal neck characteristics were the most prevalent reason for disqualification, despite the ability to cover the LSA to extend the proximal seal zone. Many of these patients (16/28) also had distal neck anatomy unsuitable for grafting. Overall, 19 patients had hostile distal necks. Difficulties with vascular access (diseased or tortuous iliac arteries, or a small caliber aorta) that could not be overcome even by use of conduits occurred in a significant fraction of patients (10/33).\nMost patients with a TAA located between the LCCA and the celiac artery can be treated by endovascular repair. Patients excluded from TAA stent graft protocols for anatomic reasons most commonly have hostile proximal neck features that preclude endovascular repair with currently available devices. Transposition of arch vessels to facilitate greater use of existing stent grafts or development of new stent graft designs are needed to expand the applicability of TAA endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "More than half of all cerebral ischemic events are the result of rupture of extracranial plaques. The clinical determination of carotid plaque vulnerability is currently based solely on luminal stenosis; however, it has been increasingly suggested that plaque morphology and biomechanical stress should also be considered. We used finite element analysis based on in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to simulate the stress distributions within plaques of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.\nThirty non-consecutive subjects (15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic) underwent high-resolution multisequence in vivo MRI of the carotid bifurcation. Stress analysis was performed based on the geometry derived from in vivo MRI of the carotid artery at the point of maximal stenosis. The finite element analysis model considered plaque components to be hyperelastic. The peak stresses within the plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were compared.\nHigh stress concentrations were found at the shoulder regions of symptomatic plaques, and the maximal stresses predicted in this group were significantly higher than those in the asymptomatic group (508.2 +/- 193.1 vs 269.6 +/- 107.9 kPa; P = .004).\nMaximal predicted plaque stresses in symptomatic patients were higher than those predicted in asymptomatic patients by finite element analysis, suggesting the possibility that plaques with higher stresses may be more prone to be symptomatic and rupture. If further validated by large-scale longitudinal studies, biomechanical stress analysis based on high resolution in vivo MRI could potentially act as a useful tool for risk assessment of carotid atheroma. It may help in the identification of patients with asymptomatic carotid atheroma at greatest risk of developing symptoms or mild-to-moderate symptomatic stenoses, which currently fall outside current clinical guidelines for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is now routinely performed with embolic protection devices, yet little is known about the compositional characteristics of the captured embolic debris and whether the type or quantity of debris correlates with patient, lesion, or operator characteristics. This study examined the embolic debris generated during CAS using electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\nBetween 2003 and 2005, CAS for carotid stenosis was performed in 175 patients. Cerebral protection devices were used in all but three cases. Sixty-four consecutive unselected microporous filters from procedures performed by a single vascular surgeon were obtained for analysis. Captured particulate debris within the protection devices was quantified (number and mean size of particles) by light microscopy for all filters. Twenty protection devices (9 symptomatic, 11 asymptomatic patients) were processed for electron microscopy and EDS to assess morphology, cellular composition, and calcium content of debris.\nCaptured particulate matter was present in 49 filters (77%) and included particles measuring 200 to 500 mum in 72%, 500 to 1000 mum in 53%, and >1000 mum in 33%. The mean number of captured particles was 6.9, and mean size was 248 +/- 150 mum. Univariate analysis revealed that sequential patient cohort and filter type were correlated with the number (but not size) of captured particles. The number of particles significantly decreased after the first cohort of 20 patients (11.5 particles) compared with the second (5.0 particles, P = .023) and third (5.2 particles, P = .029) cohorts. The type of captured debris ranged from sheets of damaged red blood cells without other components to clumps of recently activated platelets with early fibrin crosslinking to plaque debris coated with well-organized coalescing areas of platelet thrombus. Platelet activation was more common in symptomatic patients (78%) than asymptomatic patients (27%; P < .05). Despite the presence of calcified lesions in six patients whose filters were analyzed by EDS, <1% of energy emission on EDS of scanned particulate debris fell within the emission range of calcium, indicating the presence of minimal calcium in the embolic particles.\nParticulate embolic debris is released in most patients during CAS and can measure >1000 mum in one third of patients. The number of particles may decrease with increasing operator experience with CAS. Debris captured during CAS with embolic protection exhibits a range of cellular and acellular components on electron microscopy, with a higher prevalence of platelet activation evident in symptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the original-permeability Excluder (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) has been associated with postoperative sac expansion in the absence of endoleak. In these cases, we have performed an endovascular revision, relining the original endograft with another Excluder, in an effort to arrest sac expansion by reducing permeability. We have studied these cases to determine the effect of relining on aneurysm expansion.\nPatients who demonstrated sac expansion (>or=5 mm diameter, >or=5% three-dimensional volume) after EVAR with the original Excluder were evaluated. Between 1999 and 2004, the original-permeability endoprosthesis was used in 97 patients who underwent EVAR for asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Sac expansion occurred in 24 patients, of which multiple imaging modalities showed 12 had expansion without demonstrable endoleak. Nine of the 12 have had endovascular relining, and five of these nine have >6 months follow-up to form the primary basis for this report.\nAAA size was stable or smaller in the first 6 months after the original EVAR for all patients. Once expansion began (typically in the time frame of 6 to 12 months), multimodality imaging showed no aneurysm spontaneously decreased in size without intervention, despite the absence of endoleak (n = 12). Expansion exceeded clinically significant thresholds at 30 months (mean) by diameter criteria and 22 months (mean) by three-dimensional volume criteria for the five patients with >6 months follow-up after relining. Endovascular relining was performed at a mean of 36 months, with a mean hospital stay of 1 day, and no morbidity or mortality. Over the entire duration of expansion (mean, 26 months), aneurysms expanded by 6.0 +/- 1 mm/year diameter and by 12% +/- 2%/year by three-dimensional volume. At a mean of 16 months follow-up after relining with another Excluder, the mean diameter decrease was 2.0 mm/year (P < .03) and the mean volume decrease was 2.6%/year (P < .01). After relining, all AAAs were smaller by diameter or volume, or both, exceeding thresholds defining shrinkage in two of the five with >6 months follow-up after relining. There was no rupture, migration, endoleak, conversion to open repair, or aneurysm-related death in any patient.\nIt appears from the initial follow-up that AAA expansion owing to permeability issues after EVAR with the original Excluder can be arrested by endovascular relining with a low-permeability Excluder endoprosthesis.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to assess the efficacy and rate of complications of endovenous laser treatment (EVLT) of the short saphenous vein (SSV).\nDuring a 17-month period, 210 (187 patients) with SSV incompetence documented by duplex ultrasound studies were treated with EVLT using a 980-nm diode laser. Duplex ultrasound examinations were performed on the day of the procedure, within the first week, and 2 to 11 months after the procedure (mean follow-up, 4 months). Clinical examinations were performed at 2 weeks and 6 weeks. Patients were assessed for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), nerve injury, and resolution of symptoms.\nAll procedures were technically successful, and in the 126 patients (60%) who completed final follow-up scanning, 96% of SSVs remained closed. Three patients (1.6%) had numbness at the lateral malleolus at the 6-week follow-up. DVT, defined as a tail of thrombus protruding into the popliteal vein, was not detected in any limbs at the initial duplex study, but was noted in 12 limbs (5.7%) at the 1-week follow-up examination. Nine patients were treated with 3 days to 3 months of fractionated heparin and Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), and there were no DVT extensions or pulmonary emboli. The anatomic configuration of the saphenopopliteal junction was the only factor predictive of DVT.\nIntermediate-term results of EVLT of the SSV demonstrate that the technique is effective at eliminating SSV reflux and affording symptomatic relief. The incidence of nerve injury is low, but the incidence of DVT is higher than reported for the great saphenous vein. Anatomic features of the SSV may predict patient risk for DVT.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative localization of the Adamkiewicz artery and its segmental supplier in advance of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair is proposed to be useful to prevent postoperative paraplegia. The diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) was evaluated for the preoperative localization of the Adamkiewicz artery in white TAAA patients.\nThirty-nine consecutive patients with a TAA(A) scheduled for elective open surgical aortic repair preoperatively underwent MRA and CTA. Objective image quality was assessed by measuring the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the Adamkiewicz artery and was related to patient thickness. Two independent observers scored the location of the Adamkiewicz artery and the subjective image quality of vessel-background contrast of the Adamkiewicz artery, image noise, spinal cord tissue enhancement, epidural venous enhancement, and overall image quality.\nAverage detection rate for Adamkiewicz artery localization was 71% (67% to 74%) for CTA and 97% (94% to 100%) for MRA. Interobserver agreement was 82% for CTA and 94% for MRA. Signal-to-noise ratio was significantly higher (P < .001) and contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly (P < .001) lower for CTA than for MRA. Contrast of the Adamkiewicz artery (P < .001) and overall image quality (P < .004) were judged to be significantly better for MRA. Spinal cord tissue enhancement was judged stronger at CTA (P < .03), with significantly less epidural venous enhancement (P < .001). No significant difference was found in image noise. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise decreased significantly (P < .001) with increasing patient thickness for CTA but not for MRA.\nLocalization of the Adamkiewicz artery in white TAAA patients is possible with both CTA and MRA. Compared with CTA, MRA is more favorable because of the higher Adamkiewicz artery detection rate, the higher contrast-to-noise ratio, and its independence of patient thickness.",

    "abstract": "The optimal revascularization strategy in diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) is unclear. This study assessed the efficacy of tailored endovascular-first vs surgical-first revascularization stratified for the presence of diabetes.\nThis prospective cohort study, with 1-year follow up, was conducted in a tertiary referral center in a consecutive series of 383 patients (45.7% had diabetes) presenting 426 limbs with chronic CLI. Interventions were endovascular (PTA cohort, 207 limbs) or surgical (SURG cohort, 85 limbs) revascularization. Conservatively treated patients without revascularization (NON REVASC cohort, 108 limbs) were used as a reference. The main outcome measures were sustained clinical success, defined as survival without major amputation or repeated target extremity revascularization (TER), and a categoric upward shift in clinical symptoms according to the Rutherford classification.\nSustained clinical success of revascularization was significantly better in nondiabetic patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.72; P = .001 [SURG cohort]; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.78; P = .002 [PTA cohort]) compared with diabetic patients (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.43, P = .45 [SURG cohort]; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.27, P = .40 [PTA cohort]). Repeated TER significantly improved clinical success, which became equivalent between diabetic and nondiabetic patients (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.4). In multivariate analysis, treatment success was not influenced by mode of initial revascularization, neither in diabetic nor in nondiabetic patients. Cumulative 1-year mortality was 30.4%, with a trend of increased mortality in patients with diabetes (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.17; P = .064). Limb salvage rates were similar in treatment cohorts, also if stratified for diabetes (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.75).\nDiabetic patients with chronic CLI benefit from early revascularization. To achieve this benefit, multiple revascularization procedures may be required, and close surveillance is therefore mandatory. Choice of initial revascularization modality seems not to influence clinical success.",

    "abstract": "The potentially devastating complication of total or near total thoracic endoprosthesis collapse has been described with the TAG device (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz). This rare complication has resulted in a warning to clinicians and speculation about the etiology of this problem. This report evaluates potential causative anatomic factors that may increase the probability of endoprosthesis collapse in patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aneurysm repair (TEVAR).\nPreoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans were collected worldwide representing six patients who had experienced radiologically confirmed TAG endoprosthesis collapse. These were compared with a matched cohort of five patients with a TAG endoprosthesis in the same anatomic position in which no collapse occurred. Anatomic variables of aortic arch angulation, apposition, intraluminal lip length, proximal aortic diameter, distal aortic diameter, intragraft aortic diameter, percentage of oversizing, and angle of the proximal endograft to the aortic arch were compared between groups. Differences between groups were determined using the Student t test, with P < .05 considered significant.\nThe two groups (collapse vs no collapse) were evenly matched demographically, and all underwent endoluminal treatment with the TAG device, with no differences in gender, graft position in the aorta, operative indication, or age (P = NS). Distal sealing zone aortic diameter +/- standard deviation of 18.9 +/- 1.7 mm vs 22.7 +/- 2.7 mm and minimum aortic diameter within the endograft of 18.6 +/- 1.7 mm vs 22.4 +/- 3.1 mm predicted collapse (P < .05). Proximal aortic diameter, apposition, intraluminal lip length, aortic arch angle, and angle of proximal endograft to aortic arch did not predict collapse (P = NS).\nThoracic endograft collapse is an exceedingly rare event. In this series, endoprosthesis collapse occurred in patients who were treated outside the manufacturer's instructions for use for minimum required aortic diameter. Although distal aortic diameter and minimum intragraft aortic diameter predicted collapse, other variables may also influence this complication but were not significant owing to potential type II statistical errors. In the future, caution should be exercised when contemplating TEVAR in patients with small (<23 mm) aortic diameters.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to clarify the effect of the direction of pressure measurement on the pressure readout in fibrinous thrombus of the abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nThree weights of 468 g (weight 1), 578 g (weight 2), and 675 g (weight 3) were molded. A specimen of human fibrinous thrombus was positioned under the weights. Because the surface area of the weights and the thrombus was 400 mm(2), weights 1, 2, and 3 caused pressures of 88, 108, and 127 mm Hg, respectively. Pressure measurements were performed at different angles between the sensor and the applied force (0 degrees , 22.5 degrees , 30 degrees , 45 degrees , 60 degrees , 67.5 degrees , 90 degrees ) Thrombi of 10 different patients were analyzed. Pressure measurements in the thrombi at different angles were statistically compared by a linear mixed model analysis.\nThe measurements at 90 degrees differed statistically from the measurements at 0 degrees , 22.5 degrees , 30 degrees , 45 degrees , 60 degrees , and 67.5 degrees (P < .001). The pressure readout was only similar to the applied pressure when the pressure sensor was positioned at 90 degrees to the applied force. Pressure measurements in other sensor positions resulted in lower pressure measurements. Pressure changes were detected in all sensor positions.

    "abstract": "Depression is associated with worse outcomes after coronary artery bypass surgery, but its association with the results after revascularization for symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is unknown. This study assessed the association between depression and patency, recurrent symptoms, and limb salvage after revascularization for symptomatic PAD.\nElectronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients with symptomatic PAD who underwent intervention (open, endovascular, or combined) between January 2000 and October 2004. All patients were previously screened for depression, and treatment was initiated as indicated by the primary care physician or psychiatrist. Demographic data and outcomes were recorded using published guidelines. Outcomes of interest included primary patency of the revascularization (bypass graft or angioplasty/stented artery), assisted primary patency, secondary patency, recurrent symptomatic ipsilateral PAD, and major amputation. Follow-up was available for all patients (mean, 23.4 +/- 14.1 months).\nBoard-certified vascular surgeons performed all interventions. At the time of intervention, 78 (36.1%) of 216 patients had been diagnosed with depression. Compared with those without depression, depressed patients were younger (64.4 vs 69.1 years; P = .001), currently using tobacco (74.4% vs 51.4%; P = .001), and less likely to have hypertension (79.5% vs 89.9%; P = .03). No other significant differences were noted for cardiovascular risk factors or prevalent comorbidities. During follow-up, 50 patients (23.1%) had failing or failed revascularizations, and 24 (11%) had amputations. Those with depression at the time of the PAD intervention, compared at 24 months with patients without depression, had significantly worse primary patency (58.2% vs 79.8%; P = .02), primary assisted patency (59.5% vs 81.5%; P = .01), and secondary patency (60.2% vs 82.2%; P = .007). They also had a significantly increased risk of recurrent symptomatic PAD (33.7% vs 20.8%; P = .03) but not major amputation (13.8% vs 10.4%; P = .73). By multivariate analysis, patients with depression were at significantly increased risk for recurrent symptomatic PAD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 3.02; P = .04) and failure of revascularization (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.22 to 3.88; P < .01), but not major amputation.\nDepression is common among patients undergoing intervention for symptomatic PAD. After intervention, patients with depression have worse outcomes for the affected leg. Prospective analysis is required to confirm these results.",

Cases included all patients undergoing inpatient lower extremity PTA from 1997 to 2004. Patients with claudication were compared with those having PTA for other lower extremity diagnoses. The main outcome measures were readmission, reintervention (angiography, angioplasty/stent, surgical revascularization, or amputation), and death </=30 days.\nA total of 1718 patients (mean age 69.7 +/- 11.2, 52.4% male) underwent PTA for claudication (51.9%), rest pain (12.1%), ulceration (23.2%), or not otherwise specified (12.9%). Yearly PTA use nearly doubled between 1997 and 2004, from 182 to 360, with a more dramatic increase in PTA among patients with claudication. Patients undergoing PTA for claudication were younger (67.9 +/- 10.3 vs 71.7 +/- 11.7 years, P < .01), more likely male (58.2% vs 46.2%, P < .01), and had a lower comorbidity index (0.7 vs 1.1, P < .01) compared with all others. A total of 65.3% were Medicare eligible. Among 555 patients aged <65 years, the indication for PTA was claudication more often when they had private insurance compared with uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries (70.3% vs 49.1%, P < .01). Patients with claudication had shorter hospitalizations (2.4 +/- 2.3 vs 5.2 +/- 5.8 days, P < .01), lower rates of in-hospital death (0.8% vs 3.3%, P < .01), 30-day mortality (1.2% vs 4.7%, P < .01), and 30-day readmission (10% vs 23.1%, P < .05).

    "abstract": "To determine criteria for a clinically significant vein stenosis with duplex ultrasound (DU) in patients with signs and symptoms of central venous outflow obstruction.\nPatients referred with swelling with or without pain to the vascular laboratory to detect vein obstruction were evaluated. These were mostly patients who had liver transplant, dialysis access, and tumors. All patients had DU prior to any other imaging. Only patients who subsequently underwent phlebography with intention to treat the vein stenosis were included in the study. A phlebogram with two views, pressure measurements across the stenosis, and intravascular ultrasound in selected cases were performed in all patients with suspected stenosis on DU. Adjacent ipsilateral normal vein segments were utilized as controls. The invasive tests were performed within 2 weeks of the DU. Follow-up was performed with DU at discharge and within 6 months of the procedure. A pressure gradient of =3 mm Hg across the stenosis was used to define a >50% diameter reduction, which was also determined by phlebographic measurement.\nThirty-seven patients, 20 males and 17 females, mean age 54 years, range 27 to 79, were evaluated. Forty-one stenotic venous sites were detected with DU; inferior vena cava 14, superior vena cava 2, portal 2, iliac 11, common femoral 3, brachiocephalic 3, subclavian 5, and axillary vein 1. Phlebography identified 37 of these stenoses and demonstrated two more not seen by DU. Pressure measurements confirmed 39 of those detected by DU. The best criterion by DU to detect a >50% stenosis was a poststenotic to pre-stenotic peak vein velocity ratio of 2.5. The presence of poststenotic turbulence and planimetric calculations of the diameter reduction increased the diagnostic confidence but not the accuracy. Using the pressure gradient of >/=3 mm Hg as a reference test, there were two false positive and two false negative exams with DU, while phlebography had two false negative exams. The overall agreement of DU alone was 90% of phlebography >95% and when combined 100%. Intravascular ultrasound identified correctly all 11 lesions in 11 patients. After angioplasty and stenting, there was a dramatic reduction in the edema in most patients particularly in those that had a caval stenosis. Restenosis was identified by DU in 5/29 (17%) patients at 6 months that were confirmed by phlebography and pressure measurements. Reintervention was performed in four and it was successful in three.\nDU is a sensitive method to identify a clinically significant vein stenosis. A peak vein velocity ratio of >2.5 across the stenosis is the best criterion to use for the presence of a pressure gradient of =3 mm Hg. DU can be used to select patients for intervention and also to monitor the success of the treatment during follow-up.",

The presence of poststenotic turbulence and planimetric calculations of the diameter reduction increased the diagnostic confidence but not the accuracy. Using the pressure gradient of >/=3 mm Hg as a reference test, there were two false positive and two false negative exams with DU, while phlebography had two false negative exams. The overall agreement of DU alone was 90% of phlebography >95% and when combined 100%. Intravascular ultrasound identified correctly all 11 lesions in 11 patients. After angioplasty and stenting, there was a dramatic reduction in the edema in most patients particularly in those that had a caval stenosis. Restenosis was identified by DU in 5/29 (17%) patients at 6 months that were confirmed by phlebography and pressure measurements. Reintervention was performed in four and it was successful in three.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the exercise performance of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who have different types of exertional leg pain.\nPatients with PAD were classified into one of four groups according to the San Diego Claudication Questionnaire: intermittent claudication (n = 406), atypical exertional leg pain causing patients to stop (n = 125), atypical exertional leg pain in which patients were able to continue walking (n = 81), and leg pain on exertion and rest (n = 103). Patients were assessed on the primary outcome measures of ankle-brachial index (ABI), treadmill exercise measures, and ischemic window.\nAll patients experienced leg pain consistent with intermittent claudication during a standardized treadmill test. The mean (+/- SD) initial claudication distance (ICD) was similar (P = .642) among patients with intermittent claudication (168 +/- 160 meters), atypical exertional leg pain causing patients to stop (157 +/- 130 meters), atypical exertional leg pain in which patients were able to continue walking (180 +/- 149 meters), and leg pain on exertion and rest (151 +/- 136 meters). The absolute claudication distance (ACD) was similar (P = .648) in the four respective groups (382 +/- 232, 378 +/- 237, 400 +/- 245, and 369 +/- 236 meters). Similarly, the ischemic window, expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) after treadmill exercise, was similar (P = .863) in these groups (189 +/- 137, 208 +/- 183, 193 +/- 143, and 199 +/- 119 AUC).\nPAD patients with different types of exertional leg pain, all limited by intermittent claudication during a standardized treadmill test, were remarkably similar in ICD, ACD, and ischemic window. Thus, the presence of ambulatory symptoms should be of primary clinical concern in evaluating PAD patients regardless of whether they are consistent with classic intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "Outcome data documenting safety for observation of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA 4.0 to 5.4 cm) are lacking outside of large clinical trials but requires near perfect patient compliance. This study describes a clinical pathway for AAA surveillance using a prospective database utilizing a nurse practitioner oversight to provide efficient use of clinic visits while maintaining a high level of patent participation.\nOver a 7-year period (June 1999 through June 2006), 334 patients were enrolled in an AAA surveillance pathway at our academic veterans hospital. To minimize patient travel, clinic visitation was reserved for an initial examination with patient education and for discussion of intervention options in patients demonstrating AAA growth (>5.4 cm or expansion >1 cm/yr) during follow-up. Biannual ultrasound or CT imaging was scheduled and results discussed (after physician review) via telephone or \"same day\" direct patient contact. An electronic database was used to update patient information and plan follow-up.\nCompliance with the AAA surveillance pathway was achieved in 98.5% of patients, with only three patients (0.9%) lost to follow-up and two others (0.6%) choosing early repair at civilian institutions. At a mean interval of 29 months (+/-20 mo), surgical repair was performed in 225 (67%) patients by open (n = 143) or endovascular (n = 82) techniques for AAA growth to >5.4 cm (n = 219) or expansion by >1cm/yr (n = 6). One hundred six patients currently remain in surveillance. A single AAA rupture resulting in death occurred during surveillance (0.3%) and perioperative mortality (<60 days) was 0.9% in patients needing intervention for AAA growth. Cumulative aneurysm-related mortality was 0.9% for patients compliant with the AAA surveillance pathway.\nUse of a prospectively-maintained surveillance database managed by a non-physician provider with a reliance on telephone contact resulted in a high degree of patient compliance, reduced unnecessary patient travel, and provided practical clinic use. Limited additional resources were needed to implement our pathway and a similar approach may prove useful for large volume hospital, clinic, or practice systems.",

    "abstract": "This cross-sectional study was set in an academic medical center and conducted to identify associations of physical activity level and walking exercise frequency with calf skeletal muscle characteristics in individuals with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nCalf muscle characteristics in 439 men and women with PAD were measured with computed tomography at 66.67% of the distance between the distal and proximal tibia. Physical activity was measured continuously during 7 days with a vertical accelerometer. Patient report was used to determine the number of blocks walked during the past week and walking exercise frequency. Results were adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidities, ankle-brachial index, body mass index, smoking, and other confounders.\nFor both objective and subjective measures, more physically active PAD participants had higher calf muscle area and muscle density. Calf muscle area across tertiles of accelerometer-measured physical activity were first activity tertile, 5071 mm(2); second activity tertile: 5612 mm(2); and third activity tertile, 5869 mm(2) (P < .001). Calf muscle density across tertiles of patient-reported blocks walked during the past week were first activity tertile, 31.4 mg/cm(3); second activity tertile, 33.0 mg/cm(3); and third activity tertile, 33.8 mg/cm(3) (P < .001). No significant associations were found between walking exercise frequency and calf muscle characteristics.\nAmong participants with PAD, higher physical activity levels, measured by accelerometer and by patient-reported blocks walked per week, were associated with more favorable calf muscle characteristics. In contrast, more frequent patient-reported walking exercise was not associated with more or less favorable calf muscle characteristics. Results suggest that clinicians should encourage their patients to increase their walking activity during daily life.",

Performed transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) showed over 2.8-fold increase of the peak systolic velocity in the right middle cerebral artery. The emergent CT of the brain showed SAH with the right hemisphere edema. Patient was treated with Nimodipine in continuous infusion, diuretics i.v. and additional hypotensive therapy depending on blood pressure values. Clopidogrel was stopped for 5 days. Over next 4 weeks, a gradual cerebral velocities decrease was observed on TCCD, which was related to clinical and CT resolution.",

A 55-year-old man was hospitalized after the incidental discovery of a low-echogenic mass with blood flow in the hepatic artery. Selective visceral arteriography demonstrated a hepatic artery aneurysm that filled via the superior mesenteric artery. The most proximal part of the common hepatic artery was occluded. A resection of aneurysm was performed, and the arterial blood flow was restored to the liver by mobilizing the right gastroepiploic artery and anastomosing the proper hepatic artery. This technique is preferable to grafting in that only one anastomosis is necessary and predicts that the results may be at least as good as with vein or prosthetic grafts.",

Computed tomography examinations showed a needle-thin perforation of the aorta, opposite the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, with a pseudoaneurysm. A needle-sharp spinal osteophyte was located exactly opposite the perforation. There was no sign of infection, and the perforation seemed to have been caused by the osteophyte. This aortic perforation occurred without any major trauma, but repeated minor occupational trauma to her abdomen may have played an etiologic role. The pseudoaneurysm and adjacent aorta were exposed through a thoracolaparotomy. The aortic wall was normal, with good tensile strength; therefore, the perforation in the aortic wall was sutured with a double vascular suture, and the osteophyte was resected. To our knowledge, aortic perforation due to a vertebral osteophyte in the absence of major trauma has not previously been described.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of a bioabsorbable mesh containing paclitaxel on neointimal hyperplasia in a sheep model of dialysis access failure.\nForty neutered male sheep were randomized to one of five parallel groups: no mesh; or a 3-cm x 6-cm mesh with 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, or 1.2 microg/mm(2) of paclitaxel for a total dose of 0.0, 0.6, 1.3, or 2.2 mg, respectively. Commercially available 6-mm internal diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were surgically placed between the left common carotid artery and the right external jugular vein. For those animals randomized to one of the mesh groups, the mesh was placed around the distal end of the graft and venous anastomosis. Patency was assessed at weekly intervals throughout the study. Animals were euthanized 8 weeks after implantation, and grafts and veins were harvested. After histologic processing, six cross sections were cut at the venous end of the graft and vessel. The primary and secondary efficacy outcome measures, respectively, were the area and capillary density of the neointima at the graft-vein anastomosis. Histologic analyses were also performed to investigate the effects of the paclitaxel-eluting mesh on the anastomotic site.\nGrafts occluded before the scheduled sacrifice in five animals, and they were excluded from the study and not replaced. Control animals developed significant neointimal hyperplasia at the cross section taken perpendicular to the graft at its most distal end: the neointimal area measured 10.5 +/- 6.8 mm(2) in the no mesh group and 6.4 +/- 3.2 mm(2) in the zero-dose mesh group (P = .28). In contrast, neointimal area was significantly reduced in the paclitaxel mesh groups: 0.9 +/- 1.4 mm(2) in the 0.3 microg/mm(2) group (P = .008 vs zero-dose mesh), 1.3 +/- 1.5 mm(2) in the 0.7 microg/mm(2) group (P = .004 vs zero-dose mesh), and 1.2 +/- 1.4 mm(2) in the 1.2 microg/mm(2) group (P = .008 vs zero-dose mesh). Capillary density in the neointima at the graft-vein anastomosis decreased with paclitaxel and was significantly reduced in the paclitaxel mesh groups with 0.3 and 1.2 mug/mm(2) compared with the zero-dose mesh control (3.6 +/- 2.9 vs 8.9 +/- 5.6 per mm(2) [P = .022] and 1.1 +/- 1.7 vs 8.9 +/- 5.6 per mm(2) [P = .001] respectively). The paclitaxel mesh had no significant effect on healing of the anastomosis or on the thickness of the adjacent vein.\nIn this model, the paclitaxel-eluting mesh significantly reduced neointimal hyperplasia and neointimal capillary density without apparent toxicity to the adjacent vein.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion are key events in the development of intimal hyperplasia, the lesion that causes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) failure. Saphenous vein (SV) grafts are the most commonly used bypass conduits but are markedly more susceptible to intimal hyperplasia than internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts. We hypothesized that this may be due to inherent functional differences between SV-SMCs and IMA-SMCs. In this study we used paired cultures of SV-SMCs and IMA-SMCs from the same patients and compared their rates of proliferation, invasion, migration, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion.\nSMCs were cultured from explants of paired SV and IMA from 22 patients undergoing CABG. SMC populations of equivalent passage were used to determine proliferation in response to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by counting cells during a 7-day period. Immunoblotting was used to quantify phosphorylation of p44/42-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Invasion and migration rates of paired SMCs were quantified using a modified Boyden chamber technique in the presence or absence of a Matrigel basement membrane barrier (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Conditioned media from invasion assays were analyzed for secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography.\nAnalysis of areas under curves for 7-day proliferation assays revealed that the number of SV-SMCs in response to FCS, PDGF, and bFGF was 2.1, 2.0, and 2.3 times higher, respectively, than that of paired IMA-SMCs. Basal MAPK activation in SV-SMCs was approximately double that of paired IMA-SMCs. SV-SMCs exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in invasion rate (Matrigel barrier) compared with IMA-SMCs, but migration rates (no Matrigel barrier) and MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion were similar for the two cell types.\nHuman SV-SMCs are inherently more proliferative and invasive than paired IMA-SMCs, likely due to a relative increase in p44/42-MAPK activation. These inherent functional differences between SMC of different origins may contribute to the increased prevalence of intimal hyperplasia in SV grafts compared with IMA grafts.",

    "abstract": "The goal of endovenous ablation is to reduce the symptoms associated with chronic venous insufficiency. This prospective study was designed to apply the venous clinical severity score to limbs before and after endovenous saphenous vein radiofrequency ablation and to identify risk factors associated with treatment failure.\nBetween September 2003 and March 2005, 499 patients underwent 682 saphenous vein radiofrequency ablation procedures. Preoperative venous clinical severity scores were documented. Follow-up clinical and duplex examinations were performed at 4 days, 4 weeks, and 4 months after saphenous vein radiofrequency ablation and at > or=6 months thereafter. Venous clinical severity scoring was repeated at follow-up visits, and patients were asked to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the procedure.\nThe mean +/- standard deviation age of the patients was 53.5 +/- 13.3 years (range, 28 to 86 years), and 68% were women. Pretreatment CEAP clinical class C3/C4 comprised 80% of limbs (520/682). Preoperative, 4-day, 4-week, and 4-month venous clinical severity scores were, respectively, 8.8 +/- 3.7 in 648 limbs, 5.2 +/- 3.0 in 629, 4.1 +/- 2.4 in 530, and 3.3 +/- 1.6 in 479 limbs. Saphenous vein radiofrequency ablation significantly reduced pain related to lower extremity venous disease from 95.7% to 15.2% (P < .0001) and edema from 92.4% to 17.0% (P < .0001). Before treatment, venous stasis ulcers were present in 52 limbs and healed at a rate of 86%. Complications in 633 limbs at last follow-up included superficial thrombophlebitis in 12.0%, paresthesia in 0.3%, and nonocclusive thrombus extension in 0.2%. No skin thermal injury was observed. Fewer than 2% of patients reported dissatisfaction with their procedural outcome. Age (relative risk, 0.98; P = .06), female sex (relative risk, 0.19; P < .0001), and tumescent volume >250 mL (relative risk, 0.59; P = .06) were associated with higher rates of occlusion. The overall occlusion rate was 87.1%.\nAs determined by the venous clinical severity score, treatment of saphenous vein reflux with endovenous radiofrequency ablation results in the clinical improvement of symptoms and aids in the healing of venous ulcers. Age, female sex, and tumescent volume are associated with high success rates of occlusion. We found the venous clinical severity score to be an excellent stand-alone tool for assessing outcomes after saphenous vein radiofrequency ablation.",

    "abstract": "Although the treatment for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is uniform, the circumstances under which it develops vary widely and may impact outcomes. This study compared clinical features and outcomes in patients who developed a primary DVT associated with a defined risk to those without any proximate risk factor.\nConsecutive patients with a primary DVT and no past venous thromboembolism history from 2000 to 2002 were abstracted for demographics, risk factors, DVT anatomical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of death and new pulmonary embolism. Comparison between patients with a proximate risk event within 30 days of DVT (Inpt) and those presenting with DVT with no defined proximate event (Outpt) was done by univariable and multivariable statistics. A validated survey was mailed to all living patients to assess long-term sequela.\nA total of 293 patients with a mean age of 55 years and 49% men had confirmed DVT by objective means (92% duplex) with a mean follow-up of 25 +/- 21 months. Inpts were more likely to have recent surgery or blunt trauma, bilateral DVT, less use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and new pulmonary emboli (all P <.05). Outpts with DVT were more likely to have a history of malignancy, tibial-popliteal DVT compared with iliofemoral DVT, higher use of LMWH, and coumadin. However, there was no difference in mortality. From the patient survey (21% response), Outpts were more likely than Inpts to develop later varicosities and have daily frustration related to their legs (P < .05), but no difference in edema or ulceration. Considering the entire group, independent factors associated with freedom from PE included ambulation (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-5.0; P = .04) while bilateral DVT (OR = .26; 95% CI = .09-.76; P = .013) or subcutaneous heparin (OR = 22; 95% CI = .05-.98; P = .047) were associated with greater risk. Independent factors associated with survival included ambulation (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.3-7.2; P = .02), Coumadin use (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.2-6.1; P = .015), and tibiopopliteal DVT (OR = 2.4; 95% = 1.1-5.5; P = .03), while malignancy (OR = 0.1; 95% CI = .05-.24; P < .01) and myocardial infarction (OR = 0.12; 95% CI = .01-.92; P = .04) were associated with lower survival.\nPatients who develop DVT related to a defined proximate risk event (Inpt) generally have more extensive DVT, an increased risk of PE, but less long-term functional morbidity and no difference in long-term mortality compared to those with no proximate risk.",

    "abstract": "While the predominant treatment of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) remains systemic anticoagulation, there is a growing consensus that more aggressive percutaneous catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) carries both short-term and long-term benefits. There remains controversy as to whether an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is always required during CDT.\nTo define the short- and long-term outcomes of CDT with and without prophylactic IVC filter placement for lower extremity DVT.\nA database of patients treated by CDT from 1996 to 2006 was compiled. Results were standardized to current Society for Vascular Surgery criteria. Average follow-up was 2.1 years, range of 1-8 years. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Factor analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model for time dependent variables. Data are presented as mean +/- SD where appropriate.\nSixty-nine patients (39% male, average age 48 +/- 17 years) underwent CDT: (27 received pharmacological thrombolysis, 12 received mechanical thrombolysis, and 30 received mechanical and pharmacological thrombolysis). Fourteen patients (20%) had IVC filter placement prior to or during CDT. Twenty-one had a hypercoagulable state. Technical success with grade III lysis of clot burden was achieved in 63%. Fifty-one patients required an adjuvant stent. Overall, 90-day all-cause mortality was 4% and peri-procedural morbidity was 4%. No patients developed a pulmonary embolus (PE) during therapy. By Kaplan-Meier analysis 83%, 83%, and 75% of patients were free of recurrent DVT at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Hypercoagulability was associated with DVT recurrence by Cox proportional hazards analysis. No analyzed factor was predictive of PE.\nCatheter directed thrombolysis without universal prophylactic IVC filter placement is safe and effective in treating acute DVT. Pulmonary embolization did not occur during CDT. Selective rather than routine IVC filter placement is a safe and appropriate approach.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of an aggressive graft surveillance and endovascular treatment protocol on secondary patency rates of a polyetherurethaneurea vascular access graft, specially designed to provide early access and rapid hemostasis.\nOne hundred and ninety Vectra Vascular Access Grafts (C. R. Bard, Inc, Murray Hill, NJ) were placed in 176 patients (78 females and 98 males, mean age 61.7 years). There were 41 forearm grafts, 145 upper arm grafts and four thigh grafts. Graft surveillance was performed by using clinical and hemodialysis parameters to detect a failing/failed graft and followed by endovascular treatment, rheolytic thrombectomy (AngioJet, Possis Medical Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) and/or angioplasty +/- stenting of the anatomical lesion (arterial anastomosis, graft, venous outflow, draining or central veins).\nHemodialysis started after a median of 15.5 days, as soon as from the day of the operation in some cases. Bleeding complications occurred in six patients (3.2%), venous hypertension in seven (3.7%), steal syndrome in two (1.1%), neurological complications in two (1.1%), while late infection (range 2.7-14.6 months) was seen in six patients (3.2%). Thrombectomy and angioplasty (median number of sessions 1, interquartile range 1-2) was performed in 43 grafts. Isolated angioplasty, not associated with thrombosis (median number of sessions 1, interquartile range 1-2), was performed in 50 grafts. These interventions increased primary assisted patency from 69% and 63% at 12 and 18 months, respectively to a secondary patency rate of 86%.

    "abstract": "Primary failure of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a major problem affecting native hemodialysis access use. A multicenter guideline implementation program, Care Improvement by Multidisciplinary approach for Increase of Native vascular access Obtainment (CIMINO), was designed to identify modifiable and nonmodifiable factors involved in the early functionality of the AVF.\nPhysicians and dialysis staff in 11 centers in the Netherlands (N = 1092 prevalent vascular accesses) were strongly and repeatedly advised to adhere to current guidelines. It was advised to always perform a standard preoperative duplex examination and physicians were encouraged to attempt salvaging procedures for failing and failed fistulae. Specially appointed access nurses prospectively registered all created vascular accesses in an internet-linked database. Primary failure (PF) was defined as a complication of the AVF before the first successful cannulation for hemodialysis treatment. Modifiable and nonmodifiable factors were related to risk of primary failure using logistic regression models. We restricted the analyses to the first AVF of each patient that was placed during the observation period.\nBetween May 2004 and May 2006, an AVF was created in 395 patients. Primary failure occurred in one third (131 cases). Factors related to an increased risk of primary failure were female gender (odds ratio (OR): 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.94), renal replacement therapy prior to AVF placement (OR: 1.19 per year on RRT, CI: 1.05-1.34), diabetes mellitus (OR: 3.08, CI: 1.53-6.20), and AVF placement at the wrist (compared with elbow) (OR: 1.86, CI: 1.03-3.36). Primary failure rate among the participating centers varied from 8% to 50%. Compared to the two centers with the lowest primary failure rates, six centers had a significantly higher primary failure rate. Adjustment for risk factors and surgery-related factors did not materially change the center-related findings.\nIn conclusion, we have identified location of AVF placement as a modifiable factor influencing primary failure risk. More importantly, this study shows that the probability of primary failure is strongly related to the center of access creation, suggesting an important role for the vascular surgeon's skills and decisions.",

Two radiologists interpreted axial images and three-dimensional reconstructed images by consensus with respect to disease extent, lesion continuity, and disease activity based on mural and luminal changes on CT angiography.\nEighty-one (95%) patients had aortic involvement with or without aortic branch involvement, and the other four (5%) patients had only aortic branch involvement. In terms of aortic branches, the left common carotid artery (77%) and the left subclavian artery (76%) were most commonly involved. Extent of disease involvement assessed by mural change was wider than that assessed by luminal change in 52 (61%) patients. Although arterial involvement was contiguous in 69 (81%) patients, skipped lesions were identified in 16 (19%) patients. An analysis of mural findings revealed the coexistence of active and inactive lesions in nine (11%) patients.\nAortic involvement in Takayasu arteritis can occur from the aortic root to below the iliac bifurcation, and isolated branch vessel involvement is also possible.

    "abstract": "Proximal endovascular aortic graft fixation and maintenance of hemostatic seal depends on the long-term stability of the aortic neck. Previous investigations of aortic neck dilation mostly focused on the infrarenal aortic diameter. Fenestrated and branched stent grafts facilitate suprarenal graft fixation and may thereby improve the long-term integrity of the aortic attachment site. For these devices, the natural history of the suprarenal aortic segment is also of interest. We investigated the natural history of the supra- and infrarenal aortic segment after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nFor this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the preoperative and the initial postoperative as well as the most recent CT series that were obtained from 52 patients undergoing conventional repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm between January 1998 and December 2002. Measurements were performed using electronic calipers on a \"split screen\", allowing direct comparison of subsequent CT series at corresponding levels along the vessel. Main outcome measures were changes in postoperative measures of the supra- and infrarenal aortic diameters.\nThe first postoperative exam was at a mean (+/-SD) of 7.0 +/- 3.5 months, and the final exams were at 44.4 +/- 21 months. Over this time period, the estimated rate of change in suprarenal diameter was 0.18 mm/ y with 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.08 to 0.27. The estimated rate of change for the infrarenal diameter was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.27). A clinically relevant diameter increase of >or=3 mm was observed in seven patients (13%). There was evidence of larger diameter increases associated with larger AAA diameters (P = .003 and <.001 for suprarenal and infrarenal diameters), an inverted funnel shape (P = .002 and <.001), and marginal evidence of association with a history of inguinal hernia (P = .043 and .066).\nAlthough there is statistically significant evidence of increases in the supra- and infrarenal aortic diameters after conventional AAA repair, mean annual increases tended to be small and clinically relevant increases of 3 mm or more were observed in only a small proportion of cases.",

Conventional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patching has been shown to have results comparable to autogenous vein patching; however, it requires a prolonged hemostasis time. Therefore, many surgeons use collagen-impregnated Dacron patching (Hemashield [HP]). Recently, we reported a satisfactory hemostasis time using the new hemostatic PTFE patch (ACUSEAL by Gore). This study is the first prospective randomized trial comparing the ACUSEAL patch with the HP Finesse patch.\n200 CEAs were 1:1 randomized into two patch closure groups (ACUSEAL or Finesse). All patients underwent immediate and 1 month postoperative duplex ultrasound studies. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups, including the mean operative diameter of the internal carotid artery and length of arteriotomy.\nThe overall perioperative ipsilateral stroke rate was 2% (2% ACUSEAL, 2% Finesse; P = 1.0). The perioperative ipsilateral TIA rates were 0% for the ACUSEAL and 2% for the Finesse patch (P = .5). The combined perioperative neurological event (TIA + stroke) rates were 2% for ACUSEAL and 4% for the Finesse (P = .68). The early >or=50% restenosis rate was 0% for ACUSEAL vs 4% for Finesse patching. Two perioperative carotid thromboses were noted with Finesse patching vs none with ACUSEAL patching (P = .50). The combined early morbidity rate (TIA, stroke, and >or=50% restenosis or thrombosis) was 2% for the ACUSEAL patch vs 8% for the Finesse patch (P = .10). The mean hemostasis time for the ACUSEAL and Finesse patches was 5.1 vs 3.7 minutes (P = .01), however, the mean operative times were similar for both groups (P = .61).\nThe perioperative neurological events and overall short-term morbidity associated with CEA when using ACUSEAL or Finesse patches were similar.

    "abstract": "Current evaluations of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) have suggested equivalency compared with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, the incidence of stroke and death with CAS may be higher in elderly patients. We assessed the anatomic characteristics of patients undergoing CAS and compared them based on age older or younger than 80 years. The impact of age on the incidence of postoperative complications was also determined.\nFrom February 2003 to August 2005, 135 CAS procedures were performed in 133 patients. Digital subtraction angiograms for each patient were evaluated by two independent observers blinded to patient identifiers. Anatomic characteristics that impact the performance of CAS were assessed as either favorable or unfavorable. These included aortic arch elongation, arch calcification, arch vessel origin stenosis, common and internal carotid artery tortuosity, and treated lesion stenosis, calcification, and length. Postoperative events were defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Fisher's exact test and chi(2) tests were used to determine statistical significance (P < .05).\nOf the 133 patients treated, 87 (65%) were men and 46 (35%) were women; and 37 (28%) were >or=80 years of age. The cohort >or=80 years old had an increased incidence of unfavorable arch elongation (P = .008), arch calcification (P = .003), common carotid or innominate artery origin stenosis (P = .006), common carotid artery tortuosity (P = .0009), internal carotid artery tortuosity (P = .019), and treated lesion stenosis (P = .007). No significant difference was found for treated lesion calcification or length. Perioperative cerebral vascular accidents occurred in four patients (3.0%, 3 with no residual deficit, 1 with residual deficit), myocardial infarction in three (2.2%), and one patient (0.8%) died secondary to a hemorrhagic stroke. The combined stroke, myocardial infarction, and death rate for the entire population was 3.7%. The rate was significantly increased in patients aged >or=80 years old (10.8%) compared with those aged <80 years old (1%, P = .012).\nElderly patients, defined as those aged >80 years, have a higher incidence of anatomy that increases the technical difficulty of performing CAS. This increase in unfavorable anatomy may be associated with complications during CAS. Although the small number of perioperative events does not allow for determination of a direct relationship with specific anatomic characteristics, the presence of unfavorable anatomy does warrant serious consideration during evaluation for CAS in elderly patients.",

At 5 years, corelab reported 0% limb narrowing, 0% trunk migration, 0% component (contralateral leg, aortic extender, and iliac extender) migration, 0% fracture, endoleak in 3% (2 type II/68), and aneurysm growth (>5 mm compared to baseline) in 38% (30/78) of the test group. There are no aneurysm ruptures in either test or control group.\nAfter 5 years follow-up, endovascular repair is a safer and effective treatment compared with open surgical repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Major adverse events are less frequent with the endograft despite the need for late reinterventions. Aneurysm expansion is observed in nearly two-fifths of patients but is not associated with endoleak or aneurysm rupture. Multicenter clinical trials are evaluating a newer version of this device designed to avoid this high rate of sac expansion.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric bypass grafts may be followed postoperatively with duplex scanning. It is unknown, however, if duplex-derived velocity measurements vary over time or if the type of procedure (antegrade vs retrograde) and the caliber of graft affect velocity measurements. The purpose of this study was to characterize duplex findings in mesenteric bypass grafts with respect to the type of revascularization, graft caliber, and changes over time. This study also sought to identify duplex characteristics that could predict subsequent graft failure.\nDuplex examinations of mesenteric bypass grafts were reviewed. Peak systolic velocities (PSV) from the inflow artery, proximal anastomosis, mid graft, distal anastomosis, and outflow arteries were analyzed with respect to timing of the examination (index study vs follow-up exam), inflow source, distal target, and graft diameter. The results were compared with analysis of variance (P < .05). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine any association with mid-graft PSV.\nFasting postoperative duplex scans were reviewed from 43 mesenteric bypass grafts in 38 patients (28 superior mesenteric artery [SMA] alone, 3 celiac alone, 5 celiac and SMA, 2 SMA and renal). A total of 167 duplex exams were analyzed (mean of 4.5 studies per patient; range, 1 to 14). Inflow artery velocities were significantly lower in antegrade vs retrograde configurations (93 +/- 73 cm/s vs 154 +/- 73 cm/s, P < .05); however, proximal and mid-graft PSVs were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, no effect was noted on mid-graft PSV when distal targets were compared (SMA vs celiac, 149 +/- 42 cm/s vs 160 +/- 78 cm/s, P = NS). An association between smaller graft diameter and higher mid-graft PSV was seen with univariate analysis (P = .03), with a trend toward significance with multivariate analysis (P = .06). In 18 bypass grafts where a follow-up examination was available >1 year (mean 38 +/- 25 months) after the index postoperative exam, velocity did not significantly change over time. No duplex scan characteristics were predictive of graft thrombosis.\nThis is the first study, to our knowledge, to fully characterize duplex-derived flow velocities in mesenteric artery bypass grafts. Although surveillance duplex scans after mesenteric bypass procedures may be affected by graft diameter, they are not significantly affected by the choice of inflow artery. These data can serve as standards for postoperative surveillance of mesenteric bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "The management of renal artery stenosis in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms continues to be complex and technically challenging despite advances in endovascular therapy. There is growing concern about the durability of renal artery stents in the setting of transrenal abdominal aortic endografts. This study reports a single-center experience of renal artery stenting with transrenal abdominal aortic endografts for patients with renal artery stenosis.\nAll patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair preceded or followed by renal artery stent placement between January 1999 and December 2005 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively gathered endovascular database. Patients were surveyed after renal stent procedures with multidetector computed tomography angiography or duplex sonography. The surveillance data were analyzed for primary patency of the renal artery stent at 6 months, incidence of complications, need for secondary interventions, and changes in creatinine clearance (CrCl).\nSixty-two renal artery stents were placed in 56 patients (44 men, 12 women) with a mean age of 77.3 years (range, 61 to 94 years). Forty-one were placed before the endograft procedure, eight were placed during the endograft procedure, and 13 were placed postoperatively. There were no major or minor complications related to the renal artery stent procedures. Transrenal aortic endografts were used in 44 of the 56 patients, and 12 had devices with infrarenal fixation. The mean follow-up was 18.5 months (range, 1 to 73 months). The 6-month primary patency, which could be evaluated for 51 renal artery stents, was 97.4% (37/38) in patients with transrenal fixation and 84.6% (11/13) in patients with infrarenal fixation. The overall rate of in-stent restenosis was 8.5% (4/47) in the transrenal fixation group and 20.0% (3/15) in the infrarenal fixation group. The overall occlusion rate was 2.1% (1/47) in the transrenal fixation group and 0% (0/15) in infrarenal fixation group. Five (83.3%) of six patients underwent successful treatment of in-stent restenosis with placement of a new stent in all five cases. CrCl decreased in the total group by 4.2 +/- 11.8 mL/min, by 4.7 +/- 12.0 mL/min in patients with transrenal fixation, and by 2.2 +/- 11.0 mL/min in patients with infrarenal fixation.\nThe presence of a transrenal aortic endograft did not affect the outcome of the renal artery revascularization procedure in this cohort. Renal artery stenting in the presence of transrenal abdominal aortic endografts appears to be a safe procedure without adverse effect on renal artery stent patency or renal function.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the ability of endovascular optical coherence tomography (eOCT) to detect qualitative tissue alteration and quantitative changes of vein wall thickness and vein lumen diameter comparing endovenous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endovenous laser therapy (ELT) in an established ex vivo model.\nEndoluminal eOCT was performed by means of a new prototype rotating system (System M1, LightLab Imaging Inc, Boston, Mass) with automatic pullback of 1 mm/s. In the course of an eOCT examination of a 50-mm vein segment, 264 electronic cross section images with a spatial resolution of 15 to 20 mum are acquired. The eOCT scans were performed before and after treatment of each of 13 treated vein segments and of six control vein segments. Thirteen subcutaneous cow foot veins were reperfused in situ, and the defined 50-mm vein segments in the study were treated with RFA (n = 2) and ELT (n = 11). RFA followed the clinical VNUS-Closure protocol (VNUS Medical Technologies, San Jose, Calif) using a 6F 60-mm Closure-Plus catheter. ELT was performed using light of lambda = 980 nm with a laser power of 3 (n = 2), 5 (n = 2), and 7 W (n = 4) with a paced pullback protocol with laser irradiation for 1.5 seconds every 3 mm, resulting in linear endovenous energy densities (LEED) of 15, 25, and 35 J/cm. Using 11 W (n = 3) with a continuous pullback protocol at 3 mm/s resulted in a LEED of 36.5 J/cm. Ten histologic cross sections of each treated and control vein segment were correlated with the corresponding eOCT cross sections to evaluate qualitative representation of vein wall layers and tissue alterations such as ablation and vein wall perforation. In addition, 26 eOCT cross sections of every treated vein segment before and after treatment and every control vein segment were analyzed to calculate quantitative changes in media thickness and vein lumen diameter.\nIn all specimens, qualitative analysis with eOCT demonstrated a clear match with histologic cross sections. A symmetrical, complete, circular disintegration of intima and media structures, without any transmural tissue defects, was shown after RFA. Pronounced semicircular tissue ablations (3 to 14 per 50 mm) and complete vessel wall perforations (0 to 16 per 50 mm) were detected after ELT. The quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant (P < .0001) increase in intima-media thickness after RFA (37.8% to 66.7%) and ELT (11.1% to 45.7%). A significant (P < .0001) reduction of vessel lumen diameter (36.3% to 42.2%) was found after RFA. Owing to the limited number of treated vein segments and inhomogeneous baseline vein lumen diameters, no linear correlation between laser energy level and effects on tissue such as ablation/perforation, media thickening, or vein lumen diameter could be identified.\nIn our ex vivo cow foot model, eOCT is able to reproduce normal vein wall structures and endovenous acute thermal alterations, such as tissue ablation and vessel wall perforations. Endovenous eOCT images can also be analyzed quantitatively to measure media thickness or vein lumen diameter. Endovascular OCT could become a valuable alternative tool for morphologic investigation of tissue alterations after endovenous thermal procedures.",

A symmetrical, complete, circular disintegration of intima and media structures, without any transmural tissue defects, was shown after RFA. Pronounced semicircular tissue ablations (3 to 14 per 50 mm) and complete vessel wall perforations (0 to 16 per 50 mm) were detected after ELT. The quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant (P < .0001) increase in intima-media thickness after RFA (37.8% to 66.7%) and ELT (11.1% to 45.7%). A significant (P < .0001) reduction of vessel lumen diameter (36.3% to 42.2%) was found after RFA. Owing to the limited number of treated vein segments and inhomogeneous baseline vein lumen diameters, no linear correlation between laser energy level and effects on tissue such as ablation/perforation, media thickening, or vein lumen diameter could be identified.",

    "abstract": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) imparts a significant survival disadvantage to individuals undergoing lower extremity revascularization; however, the influence of lesser degrees of renal impairment remains unclear. This study examined the prognostic significance of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification on survival, limb salvage, and graft patency in patients undergoing lower extremity arterial reconstruction.\nA prospective registry was evaluated for consecutive patients between January 31, 1995, and December 21, 2004, undergoing first-time, lower extremity vein bypass surgery. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation using each patient's preoperative creatinine concentration. CKD categories were taken from current National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative staging criteria.\nThe cohort included 456 subjects, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 68.1 +/- 10.8 years. There were 274 men (60%) and 378 Caucasians (82.5%). Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus in 270 (59.0%), hypertension in 333 (72.7%), coronary artery disease in 242 (52.8%), and dyslipidemia in 203 (44.5%). The surgical indication was critical limb ischemia in 384 (83.8%). Among the variables examined, diabetes and critical ischemia as the indication for bypass were significantly skewed toward higher CKD classifications (P < .001). The 5-year survival rates by CKD class were, CKD 1 and 2, 57%; CKD 3, 46%; CKD 4, 23%; and CKD 5, 9.5%. On univariate analysis, age, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, critical ischemia, and CKD were significant predictors of mortality. After adjustment, however, only age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.06) and CKD stages 4 (HR, 4.23; 95% CI, 2.04 to 8.75) and 5 (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.96 to 5.45) retained significance. Subjects within the CKD 5 classification were more likely to have a major amputation (P = .018) compared with all other CKD classes. Notably, no relationship was detected between CKD category and graft patency.\nCKD staging adequately differentiates survival curves and risk for major amputation among patients with renal impairment who are undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery. This may help in clinical decision analysis as well as in the refinement of stratification in future clinical trial design where survival is an end point.",

    "abstract": "The elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) may decrease a patient's risk of rupture and confers a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate than emergency repair. Previous works have shown that AAA rupture rates are higher in women compared to men, and that women have higher associated in-hospital mortality rates. This study was performed to evaluate, currently, to what extent patient gender influences presentation and treatment of AAA and the associated outcomes in the United States.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used, with pertinent ICD-9 codes, to identify all patient-discharges that occurred with the primary diagnosis of intact (iAAA) or ruptured/dissecting (rAAA) abdominal aortic aneurysms between the years 2001 and 2004. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses of variables were performed.\nAn estimated 220,403 AAA patient-discharges were identified during the study period. 37,016 (17%) patients presented with rAAA. A higher percentage of women with AAA presented with rupture compared to men (21% vs 16%; odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.54). This rupture rate did not significantly change from 2001 to 2004 (P = .85 for trend). For iAAA, women had higher odds of in-hospital mortality than men (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.24-2.07). Compared to men, in-hospital mortality rates for women with iAAA were higher for both endovascular (2.1% vs 0.83%, P < .0001) and open repairs (6.1% vs 4.0%, P < .0001). For iAAA, fewer women underwent endovascular repair (32.4% vs 46.7%, P < .0001; O.R. 0.59, 95% CI, 0.52-0.67). For patients who presented with rAAA, women were less likely to undergo surgical intervention compared to men (59% vs 70%, P < .0001). For those that underwent repair, women had higher in-hospital mortality rates than men (43% vs 36%, P < .0001; OR 1.49, 95% CI, 1.16-1.91).\nA higher percentage of women currently present with aneurysm rupture.

    "abstract": "Patients after infrainguinal vein bypasses are a group at risk of graft stenosis and occlusion. Revision of failing grafts has been shown to significantly improve bypass patency and limb salvage. Options for surgical revision of mid bypass stenosis includes either patch angioplasty (PA) or interposition grafting (IG). We reviewed our experience with surgical revision of vein bypass stenosis.\nFrom April 1968 to March 2006, 7557 autogenous vein bypasses were performed at Albany Medical Center and its affiliated institutions, of these 316 required single or multiple revision of vein grafts with patch angioplasty or interposition vein grafting. Excluded were proximal and distal anastomotic revisions. Only 235 bypasses had single revisions as either patch angioplasty (n = 108) or interposition grafting (n = 127) and are the focus of this review. The initial bypass revisions in these two groups are analyzed for indications, clinical parameters, operative strategies, and long-term patencies and clinical outcomes.\nThere were no significant differences in mean age, gender, or frequency of comorbid conditions (coronary artery disease, pulmonary disease, hypertension, and diabetes) between the two patient groups. Secondary patency of patch angioplasty revision at 5 years was 79%. Patencies for interposition grafting revision at 5 years were equivalent to patch angioplasty group at 75%. When bypasses were evaluated on the basis of initial reconstructions (ie, in situ vs excised vein bypass), the results showed that in situ bypasses that required initial revision had similar 5-year patencies when interposition grafting was used as the first revision strategy vs patch angioplasty (80% vs 73%). Excised vein bypasses had similar patency when patch was their first revision strategy vs interposition grafting (4 year secondary patency 92% vs 75% respectively).\nAutogenous vein bypasses are at risk for developing significant stenosis and occlusion with time. Bypass stenosis that develops in the main body of the graft can be effectively repaired using either patch angioplasty or interposition grafting. Depending on the host of other factors, such as availability of autogenous venous conduit, location of stenosis, accessibility for operative repair, and the patient's anatomic characteristics, either operative strategy is effective in prolonging the patency of the bypass.",

It is, however a time-consuming and expensive technique, which has not been covered by Japanese medical insurance since the year 2002. In this report we introduce a new imaging technique of fluorescent lymphography to diagnose lymphedema.\nFluorescence images of subcutaneous lymphatic drainage after subcutaneous injection of indocyanine green (ICG) at the foot were obtained using a newly developed near-infrared camera system. ICG fluorescent lymphography was performed in 12 patients with secondary lymphedema and 10 healthy volunteers. The 12 patients were diagnosed with secondary lymphedema according to the medical history and lymphoscintigram, of which 11 had a history of hysterectomy with extended lymph node dissection and local radiation therapy for uterine cancer. Lymphedema developed in one patient after femorotibial artery bypass for peripheral artery occlusive disease.\nFour abnormal fluorescent patterns of the lymph drainage were observed in lymphedema: dermal backflow (an abnormal filling of the lymph capillaries), extended fluorescent signal at the dorsum and plantar region of the foot, dilated lymph channels with proximal obliteration, and diffuse glittering of fluorescent signals with scattered twinkling of the dye. Continuous lymph channels from the injection site of the foot to the groin were observed along the medial aspect of thigh in healthy subjects.\nICG fluorescence lymphography is safe, simple, and minimally invasive. The device is portable and easy to use. The technique may be useful in clinical practice to identify presence of lymphatic disorder.",

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a sex-linked condition affecting about 1 of every 5000 males in the United States. The management of children with hemophilia can be improved with regular intravenous infusion of factor VIII or IX, thus preventing crippling and sometimes fatal hemorrhage. Maintaining this vital intravenous access is often hampered by gradual loss of superficial veins or repeated central catheter sepsis and thrombosis. This study reviewed an experience with arteriovenous fistula in selected hemophilia patients with limited venous access.\nConsecutive patients operated on between October 2000 and July 2006 for venous access with the creation of an arteriovenous fistula were reviewed. They were selected because of repeated problems with other venous access. Patency, ease of use, duplex scan derived brachial artery diameter, and arm length were assessed.\nDuring a 69-month period, 10 arteriovenous fistulas (five brachial artery-basilic vein fistulas, 5 brachial artery-cephalic vein fistulas) were created for nine patients. The patients were a median age of 5.5 years (range, 1 to 27 years), and all were <13 except the 27-year-old patient. There were no postoperative hematomas requiring evacuation. One arteriovenous fistula failed to mature and was redone in the opposite arm, which subsequently occluded after 13 months. Of the mature fistulas, patency was 100% at 1 year, 80% (4/5) at 3 years, and 75% (3/4) at 4 years, with mean follow-up of 22 months. Brachial artery diameter increased in the involved arm by a ratio of 1.95 (range, 1.51 to 2.5) compared with the opposite arm. Arm length disparity was increased by 0.5 cm (range, 0.8 to 1.5 cm) in the involved arm. All fistulas allowed good access at home by a care provider.\nFor hemophilia patients with compromised venous access, arteriovenous fistulas provide good early patency. Brachial artery diameter and arm length require continued follow-up.",

The patients were a median age of 5.5 years (range, 1 to 27 years), and all were <13 except the 27-year-old patient. There were no postoperative hematomas requiring evacuation. One arteriovenous fistula failed to mature and was redone in the opposite arm, which subsequently occluded after 13 months. Of the mature fistulas, patency was 100% at 1 year, 80% (4/5) at 3 years, and 75% (3/4) at 4 years, with mean follow-up of 22 months. Brachial artery diameter increased in the involved arm by a ratio of 1.95 (range, 1.51 to 2.5) compared with the opposite arm. Arm length disparity was increased by 0.5 cm (range, 0.8 to 1.5 cm) in the involved arm. All fistulas allowed good access at home by a care provider.",

    "abstract": "The reported rate of subclinical brain injury after carotid artery stenting (CAS) seen on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) varies from 10% to >40%. Data from transcranial Doppler after CAS indicate that embolization may continue for several days, suggesting that that at least some lesions seen on DWI occur postprocedure. Because DWI lesions appear <or=1 hour of embolization, we used DWI to prospectively study patients before CAS, 1 hour after, and 48 hours after CAS to answer this question.\nThe study participants were 48 male patients aged 59 to 83. All patients were examined by a neurologist before and after the procedure and had DWI preprocedure and 48 hours postprocedure. In addition, 23 patients had a DWI 1 hour post-CAS. Magnetic resonance imaging exams, including axial and coronal DWI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, were read by two neuroradiologists blinded to the study timing. The embolic protection device was obtained from all patients, washed, and the contents examined under a digital microscope for fragments >or=60 microm.\nThere were two periprocedural strokes and one transient ischemic attack (TIA), but no strokes or TIAs occurred during follow-up. In the 23 patients imaged 1 hour postprocedure, new lesions were found in two (9%), and 18 (78%) had new lesions at 48 hours (P < .001). For the entire study group, the incidence of new lesions at 48 hours was 67% (36/54). The median number of DWI lesions was four (range, 1 to 17). Every protection device examined had atherosclerotic debris, with a mean of 135 +/- 73 fragments (range, 18 to 310) sized >60 microm and a mean of eight fragments (range, 2 to 21) sized >500 microm. Findings on postprocedure DWI did not correlate with the degree of stenosis, size of angioplasty balloon, or number of inflations, nor with the number or size of fragments retrieved from the protection device.\nCAS can be performed with a very low incidence of clinically evident neurologic events; however, it is associated with embolization during and after the procedure. Protection devices effectively prevent clinical and subclinical events during the procedure. Significant embolization continues for at least 48 hours postprocedure, causing lesions on DWI when there is no mechanism for cerebral protection. These data correlate with transcranial Doppler reports of continued embolization after CAS and indicate that DWI should be done as late as possible to accurately assess the rate of subclinical brain injury with CAS procedures.",

    "abstract": "A hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (AVF) requires surgical modification in patients with cardiac overload or dialysis access-associated steal syndrome (DASS). Creation of an artificial stenosis (banding) within the AVF may be used, but this technique lacks the guidance of objective parameters. The aim of this pilot study was to identify indicators that reflect AVF flow in dialysis patients with either access-related cardiac overload (CO) or DASS requiring corrective surgery.\nPatients underwent serial measurements of subclavian venous saturation (Sat(ven)), access flow (Flow(us)), and index digital pressures (P(dig)) during a corrective banding procedure.\nData were obtained in 14 individuals (9 men; mean age, 53 +/- 6 years) during 16 studies (CO, n = 8; DASS, n = 8). Before surgery, correlations between preoperative flow, Sat(ven) and P(dig) were not significant. Stepwise banding of the AVF altered Sat(ven) in both groups from a mean of 91% +/- 1% (open AVF) to 84% +/- 2% (closed AVF, P < .001). The CO patients demonstrated a larger drop (-13%) compared with the DASS patients (-4%). Values of P(dig) increased from 68 +/- 9 to 90 +/- 9 mm Hg (P < .001), and both groups demonstrated a similar +23 mm Hg increase. In concert, the digital brachial index also significantly improved in all patients from 0.60% +/- 0.09% to 0.74% +/- 0.10%. Linearity was present between alterations in Flow(us) and Sat(ven) in all patients, but mostly in the CO patients (r(2) = 0.96).\nStepwise banding of hemodialysis fistulas leads to dose-dependent decreases in flow and ipsilateral subclavian venous saturation combined with augmented digital pressures in patients with cardiac overload and dialysis associated steal syndrome. Intraoperative measurements of venous saturation and digital pressures may have the potential of guiding surgical correction in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are associated with improved outcome in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Statins may also have beneficial properties beyond their lipid-lowering effect.\nA prospective, observational cohort study was conducted at a university hospital from 1990 to 2005 to examine whether higher doses of statins and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are both independently associated with improved outcome in peripheral arterial disease. Enrolled were 1374 consecutive patients (age, 61 +/- 10 years, 73% male) with peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index <or=0.90). They were screened for clinical risk factors, statin therapy, and LDL cholesterol levels. Serial LDL cholesterol levels were measured at 6 months and yearly after enrollment. The mean follow-up time was 6.4 +/- 3.6 years, and no patients were lost to follow-up. The primary end points were all-cause and cardiac mortality. The secondary end point was the progression to kidney failure.\nOverall mortality, cardiac death, and progression to kidney failure occurred in 29%, 20%, and 5% of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher doses of statins (per 10% increase) and lower 6-month LDL cholesterol levels (per 10 mg/dL decrease) were both independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.80; and HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.98, respectively) and cardiac death (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.86; and HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.98, respectively). Higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also correlated significantly with lower all-cause and cardiac mortality. Higher doses of statins (per 10% increase) were associated with less progression to kidney failure (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.89).\nHigher doses of statins and lower LDL cholesterol levels are both independently associated with improved outcome in patients with peripheral arterial disease. These results support the view that statins have beneficial effects beyond their lipid-lowering properties and should be considered in all patients with PAD, irrespective of LDL cholesterol levels.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis of the immune system is maintained by apoptotic elimination of potentially pathogenic autoreactive lymphocytes. Emerging evidence shows that Fas-mediated apoptosis is impaired in activated lymphocytes from patients with autoimmune disease. The aim of this work was to assess apoptosis mediated by the cell death receptor Fas in peripheral T lymphocytes from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nThe apoptotic pathway was triggered by anti-Fas monoclonal antibodies in cultured and activated peripheral T-cell lines from 20 AAA patients with control groups of 15 patients with aortic atherosclerotic occlusive disease (AOD) and 25 healthy individuals. Cell survival and death (apoptosis) rate were assessed.\nCross-linkage of Fas receptor exerted a strong apoptotic response on T cells from AOD patients and healthy controls, but a much less pronounced effect on T cells from AAA patients. The evaluation of cell survival rate showed a significantly higher percentage in AAA group (98.9% +/- 10.3%) than in the AOD subjects (58.9% +/- 15.2%) or the healthy group (59.4% +/- 12.9%; P < .001). Apoptosis assessment by annexin V and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry showed similar results. The defect in AAA group was not due to decreased Fas expression, since Fas was expressed at normal levels. Moreover, it specifically involved the Fas system because cell death was induced in the normal way by methylprednisolone. Complementary DNA sequencing identified no causal Fas gene mutation, but two silent single nucleotide polymorphisms with higher frequency were found in the AAA group.\nFas-induced apoptosis in activated T cells from AAA patients is impaired. This may disturb the normal down-regulation of the immune response and thus provide a new insight into possible mechanisms and routes in the pathogenesis of AAA.",

    "abstract": "In patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), distal revascularization remains the procedure of choice for preventing limb loss, but long-term outcomes for pain relief, wound healing, and prevention of amputation remain suboptimal. Prostaglandin drug therapy as an adjuvant to revascularization may improve these outcomes. The current trial was designed to test the hypothesis that the use of lipo-ecraprost, a lipid encapsulated prostaglandin E(1) prodrug, as an adjunctive therapy after distal revascularization would improve amputation-free survival in patients with CLI.\nThe study was randomized, multicenter, double blind, and placebo controlled. Patients meeting clinical and hemodynamic criteria for CLI who were undergoing either bypass or endovascular revascularization of the below knee popliteal or more distal arteries were randomized to receive placebo or a 60-microg dose of lipo-ecraprost administered intravenously starting <or=72 hours of the index revascularization and then 5 days per week for 8 weeks. The study primary end point was the composite end point of death or amputation at or above the level of the ankle at 180 days.\nThe study randomized 322 patients, and 284 received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 213 patients underwent surgical bypass, and 71 underwent endovascular revascularization before receiving study medication. The distribution of index revascularization procedures and location of distal target arteries were similar for both placebo and lipo-ecraprost groups. At 180 days, 21 patients (7.4%) were lost to follow-up before reaching the primary end point. Seventy-one percent of the patients taking the placebo completed at least half the doses of the study medication compared with 48% of those taking lipo-ecraprost. Index leg revascularization-assisted primary patency was 82% in the placebo group and 84% in the lipo-ecraprost group (P = .874). Changes in lower extremity hemodynamics as a result of the revascularization during the study period did not differ between the placebo and lipo-ecraprost treatment arms. For the primary event of amputation-free survival, there were no differences between groups: 19 major amputations occurred in the placebo group and 17 in the lipo-ecraprost group; 19 deaths occurred in the placebo group and 13 in the lipo-ecraprost group.\nEight weeks of parenteral therapy with lipo-ecraprost after distal revascularization in patients with CLI provided no additional benefit in the reduction of major amputation or death at 180 days.",

The distribution of index revascularization procedures and location of distal target arteries were similar for both placebo and lipo-ecraprost groups. At 180 days, 21 patients (7.4%) were lost to follow-up before reaching the primary end point. Seventy-one percent of the patients taking the placebo completed at least half the doses of the study medication compared with 48% of those taking lipo-ecraprost. Index leg revascularization-assisted primary patency was 82% in the placebo group and 84% in the lipo-ecraprost group (P = .874). Changes in lower extremity hemodynamics as a result of the revascularization during the study period did not differ between the placebo and lipo-ecraprost treatment arms. For the primary event of amputation-free survival, there were no differences between groups: 19 major amputations occurred in the placebo group and 17 in the lipo-ecraprost group; 19 deaths occurred in the placebo group and 13 in the lipo-ecraprost group.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a growing health problem for many Americans and often occurs along with other cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus (DM), low-grade inflammation, hypertension, and lipid disorders. Intermittent claudication (IC), an early manifestation of PAD, commonly leads to reduced quality of life for patients who are limited in their ambulation. While recent wide adoption of percutaneous peripheral interventional (PPI) techniques has increased the number patients being aggressively treated for IC, the overall effectiveness of PPI for the treatment of IC is not well known, especially for DM patients who have both hemodynamic and functional obstacles to treatment success. This review is designed to illustrate how treatment outcomes for IC can be measured by different modalities and how diabetes and inflammation can influence those outcomes. In the setting of greater concern for health care resources and clinical accountability, better understanding of treatment outcomes and efficacy will help us manage these complex challenges.",

    "abstract": "Surgical bypass of arterial occlusions using autogenous vein provides an effective treatment for many patients with advanced coronary or peripheral atherosclerosis. However, the long-term benefit of bypass surgery is limited by the development of de novo occlusive lesions within the vein graft, which occurs in a significant percentage of patients over time. The pathophysiology of vein graft failure involves a complex interplay between an acute vascular injury response and the hemodynamic adaptation of the vein to arterial forces. Cell proliferation, inflammation, and matrix metabolism are critical components of postimplantation remodeling. Conventional pharmacotherapy has had limited impact on graft failure. Vein grafts present a unique and attractive opportunity for molecular engineering, which is defined for purposes of this review as the local application of genomic (eg, gene transfer or gene inhibition) or proteomic interventions designed to alter the healing response. The critical enabling technologies for these strategies are described, with a perspective on preclinical and clinical development for this indication. The recently completed clinical trials of edifoligide (E2F decoy oligodeoxynucleotide) provide important lessons for future studies. A better understanding of the remodeling response of vein grafts in humans is required to design effective molecular therapies and to define the appropriate target populations and surrogate markers for future clinical trials.",

Although numerous studies have demonstrated excellent patency and limb salvage after surgical revascularization procedures, survival in this patient population is poor, comorbidities reducing quality of life are rampant, and recovery from limb salvage surgery can be prolonged and complicated despite \"success\" as defined by traditional reporting methods. Patient-oriented outcome end points, such as health- related quality of life and functional status, are essential in defining optimal treatment options for the population of patients with critical limb ischemia. This area of research remains in its infancy, but will become increasingly important as the population of patients with critical limb ischemia and treatment options for these patients continue to expand.

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery has traditionally relied on prospective, randomized clinical trials, case-control series from single institutions of excellence, and case studies to guide clinical decision-making. However, the use of a number of new clinical research tools has allowed the vascular surgeon to more critically assess the indications for particular operations, the costs of various procedures from both a monetary and quality-of-life standpoint, and the \"real world\" outcomes that can be expected from practitioners across the United States, not just from centers of excellence. Decision analysis with modeling of cohorts with desired characteristics and vascular disease has allowed for the objective determination of procedural cost-effectiveness and evaluation of patient quality-of-life issues surrounding vascular procedures. The use of large national administrative databases has yielded important information concerning factors associated with improved outcomes after several vascular procedures across the entire United States, especially after relatively uncommon operations, such as thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Administrative data have also enabled us to learn that access to various new endovascular procedures is somewhat limited, especially for the uninsured or poor. Hospital and surgeon volume, as a surrogate marker for quality, has been directly correlated with lower morbidity and mortality as well as differences in perioperative complications after multiple vascular procedures. A certificate of added qualification in General Vascular Surgery has also been shown to improve outcomes in patients undergoing vascular procedures. Finally, pioneered by the Veteran's Affairs administration and championed by the American College of Surgeons, prospectively collected data (National Surgery Quality Improvement Program) from the Veteran's Affairs and private sector hospitals is providing high-quality, risk-adjusted feedback about multiple vascular procedures to the hospital and the individual practitioner. Importantly, the body of literature generated using these new clinical research tools is being monitored by insurers and patients, as well as by the surgeons providing the care. This ultimately will have a direct impact on practice and referral patterns. It is therefore mandatory that vascular surgeons understand these new tools so that we can police our own practices before others, such as insurance companies and hospital administrators, do it for us.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of endografts to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms has prompted the need for improved postoperative imaging and surveillance. Although patients benefit from decreased morbidity with endovascular repair compared with open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, the long-term outcome of stent repair has yet to be fully determined. The persistence of endoleaks highlights the need for close follow-up, particularly because this may lead to aneurysm rupture, even after endograft repair. The current mainstay of assessing the healing of endografts is obtaining serial helical computed tomography angiography (CTA) to identify endoleaks, graft migration, thrombosis, and structural failure. CTA is not completely effective at identifying endoleaks and predicting aneurysm rupture, however. Other modalities have been studied to improve on current imaging methods, including three-dimensional CTA with volumetric analysis, contrast-enhanced duplex ultrasound imaging, cine magnetic resonance angiography, and explant analysis. In vitro and large-animal models of abdominal aortic aneurysm have also been developed to study the pathophysiology and treatment response of aneurysm exclusion. Thus, clinical and experimental models of endograft healing are attempting to define the optimal method of postoperative surveillance of endovascular repair.",

Many creative combinations of autologous cells and scaffolds exist along with an equally long list of microenvironmental cues used to create a functional arterial conduit. This review outlines our work using abdominal wall fat as a source of autologous stem cells for vascular tissue engineering, focusing specifically on this stem cell's availability and potency to differentiate into endothelial-like cells. In a series of 49 patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery, an abundant quantity of adult stem cells was harvested from fat obtained by liposuction. The efficacy of the isolation did not appear influenced by advanced age, obesity, renal failure, or vascular disease, although fat from diabetic patients yielded significantly less stem cells. In addition, these adipose-derived stem cells acquired several morphologic and molecular endothelial phenotypes when exposed to growth factors (endothelial cell growth supplement and vascular endothelial growth factor) and physiologic shear stress in vitro. Taken together, these studies suggest that fat appears to be a viable source of autologous stem cells for use in vascular tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "This translational research program applies a working model of advanced functional genomics/proteomics and bioinformatics to human peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). It is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort of clinicians, scientists, and statisticians with an advisory panel consisting of experts in inflammation biology, vascular biology, molecular genetics, bioinformatics, clinical trial design, and epidemiology. The proposed human initiative is designed to study 300 symptomatic patients with PAOD undergoing medical management with or without vascular intervention by lower extremity angioplasty/stenting or vein graft bypass. The study aims to test the hypothesis that the systemic inflammatory response after vascular intervention influences the local milieu responsible for vascular repair and adaptation. The expectation is that this response is not uniform in all patients but, rather, is modulated by either preoperative genetic predisposition or postprocedure differential regulation of the innate immune response to injury that promotes a maladaptive phenotype leading to intervention failure. Therefore, some of these differences may be present and detectable before intervention and amenable to class prediction and prospective treatment strategies, whereas others may be detectable in the early postprocedural period, before the onset of clinical failure, permitting interventions to prevent an adverse outcome. The combination of genomic/proteomic data together with functional and quality-of-life outcome measures to define a critical model for class prediction and analysis should lead to new knowledge about failure mechanisms of vascular intervention and new strategies to improve existing approaches to lower extremity revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Since its discovery, nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a biologically important molecule and was even named Molecule of the Year by Science magazine in 1992. Specific to our interests, NO has been implicated in the regulation of vascular pathology. This review begins with a summary of the molecular biology of NO, from its discovery to the mechanisms of endogenous production. Next, we turn our attention to describing the arterial injury response of neointimal hyperplasia, and we review the role of NO in the pathophysiology of neointimal hyperplasia. Finally, we review the literature regarding NO-based therapies. This includes the development of inhalational-based NO therapies, systemically administered L-arginine and NO donors, NO synthase gene therapy, locally applied NO donors, and NO-releasing prosthetic materials. By reviewing the current literature, we emphasize the tremendous clinical potential that NO-based therapies can have on the development of neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Arterial calcification is a complex and independently regulated process with risk factors similar to those for atherosclerotic occlusive disease. It may develop either within the atherosclerotic intima or in the media. When calcification is found in coronary or lower extremity arteries, it is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and lower extremity amputation. Recent evidence suggests a role for several endogenous stimulators and inhibitors in the pathogenesis of arterial calcification. Inflammatory mediators and matrix-degrading enzymes are also thought to control the progression of calcification in humans. Current research involves efforts to define the complex interactions between cellular and molecular mediators of arterial calcification.",

    "abstract": "Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are important in the recruitment of leukocytes to injured tissues and, as such, play a pivotal role in arteriogenesis and the tissue response to ischemia. Hind limb ischemia represents a complex model with arteriogenesis (collateral artery formation) occurring in tissues with normal perfusion while areas exhibiting ischemic necrosis undergo angiogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration; monocytes and macrophages play an important role in all three of these processes. In addition to leukocyte trafficking, chemokines are produced by and chemokine receptors are present on diverse cell types, including myoblasts, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. Thus, the chemokine system may have direct effects as well as inflammatory-mediated effects on arteriogenesis, angiogenesis, and skeletal muscle regeneration. This article reviews the complexity of the hind limb ischemia model and the role of the chemokine system in arteriogenesis and the tissue response to ischemia. Special emphasis will be placed on the roles of monocytes/macrophages and CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in these processes.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, the vasculature is among the first organs to form and is in charge of maintaining metabolic homeostasis by supplying oxygen and nutrients and removing waste products. As one would expect, blood vessels are critical not only for organ growth in the embryo but also for repair of wounded tissue in the adult. An imbalance in angiogenesis (a time-honored term that globally refers to the growth of new blood vessels) contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous malignant, inflammatory, ischemic, infectious, immune, and wound-healing disorders. This review focuses on the central role of the growth of new blood vessels in ischemic and diabetic wound healing and defines the most current nomenclature that describes the neovascularization process in wounds. There are now two well-defined, distinct, yet interrelated processes for the formation of postnatal new blood vessels, angiogenesis, and vasculogenesis. Reviewed are recent new data on vasculogenesis that promise to advance the field of wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Although major advances have been made in the prevention and treatment of restenosis following coronary and peripheral interventions, the persistent complications of thrombosis and reintervention remain a mainstay for repeat hospitalizations in this patient population. For many years, a ubiquitous cell surface receptor called alpha(v)beta(3) integrin was the target of investigators in the prevention of restenosis because its interaction with the extracellular matrix was believed to coordinate the migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the media to the intima, the seminal event in the formation of intimal occlusive lesion. After the publication of uniformly positive animal studies demonstrating that alpha(v)beta(3) integrin blockade led to a significant reduction in new intimal (neointimal) lesion formation, early clinical trials supported the association of avoidance of target lesion revascularization and the use of antagonists to the SMC integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and its related platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3). However, a series of clinical trials subsequently demonstrated that these antagonists did not necessarily prevent revascularizations by inhibiting intimal hyperplasia per se. Additional animal studies subsequently showed that, indeed, in the setting of pre-existing SMCs in the intimal lesion (ie, atherosclerotic plaque, fatty streaks), inhibiting SMC migration by way of beta(3) integrin blockade was an ineffective approach in the prevention of intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. However, given the wealth of basic and clinical information on the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and its antagonists, we discuss in this article our new approach to this old solution by targeting a new clinical problem of early failure arteriovenous access for hemodialysis. Given the uniqueness of arteriovenous access in that there are essentially no significant atherosclerotic lesions in the artery and vein prior to the anastomosis, the seminal event of the migration of SMCs from the media to the neointima could by targeted once again with beta(3) integrin antagonists.",

These cells perform biosynthetic, proliferative, and contractile roles in the vessel wall. VSMCs are not terminally differentiated and are able to modulate their phenotype in response to changing local environmental cues. There is clear evidence that alterations in the differentiated state of the VSMC play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia, as well as in a variety of other major human diseases, including hypertension, asthma, and vascular aneurysms.

Although the source of the smooth muscle cells that accumulate in the vascular wall is controversial, possibly reflecting migration from the adventitia, from the circulating blood, or in situ differentiation, the intracellular signal transduction pathways that control these processes are being defined. Some of these pathways include the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt, Rho, death receptor-caspase, and nitric oxide pathways. Signal transduction pathways provide amplification, redundancy, and control points within the cell and culminate in biologic responses. We review some of the signaling pathways activated within smooth muscle cells that contribute to smooth muscle cell heterogeneity and development of pathology such as restenosis and neointimal hyperplasia.",

Control of gene expression occurs at multiple checkpoints, including the transcription of DNA into RNA and the translation of RNA into protein. Translational control mechanisms are important regulators of cellular phenotype, controlling up to 10% of overall cellular gene expression, yet they remain relatively understudied when compared with transcriptional control mechanisms. Specific regulation of protein synthesis from messenger RNA transcripts allows cells to temporally unlink translation from transcription and provides a mechanism for a more rapid response to environmental signals than if transcription were required. We discuss some of the fundamental concepts of translational control, tools for studying it and its relevance to vascular cells, in particular the endothelium.",

Older people were more severely affected. Telangiectases were more frequent in women, and men had a higher incidence of trunk varices, trophic changes, and venous reflux. Frequency of both visible and functional venous disease increased with family history and body mass index. Presence of reflux correlated positively with increasing CEAP grade of visible disease (Pfor trend < .0001 for all superficial venous segments). A large number of subjects, especially women, complained of subjective symptoms in the legs, and the presence of symptoms correlated almost always positively with both worsening of visible findings (P for trend < .001) and presence of hemodynamic change in both genders.\nThe frequency of reflux increased with the severity of visible signs of disease as described by the CEAP classification. In men, the occurrence of subjective symptoms was mostly correlated with functional disorders.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with morbidity and mortality of coronary heart disease and stroke. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial disease. However, the prevalence and risk factors of PAD in hypertensive patients have not been studied in China.\nIn order to investigate the prevalence of PAD and its risk factors in China, a cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 4716 patients with hypertension and 833 age-gender matched people without hypertension were recruited; age 40 to 75 years, from seven rural communities. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <or= 0.9 in either leg; hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >or=140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure >or=90 mm Hg, or history of antihypertensive drug use.\nThe prevalence of PAD is 8.7% (n = 408) in patients with hypertension (n = 4716), higher than in people without hypertension (5.0%, n = 833, P = .004). Hypertensive patients with PAD were older, (61 +/- 8.6 vs 58 +/- 8.6, P < .01), had more conventional cardiovascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure (170 +/- 22.6 vs 167 +/- 22.7, P < .01), pulse pressure (72 +/- 19.7 vs 68 +/- 18.9, P < .01), blood glucose (5.8 +/- 2.2 vs 5.6 +/- 1.7, P < .05), total cholesterol (5.7 +/- 1.3 vs 5.5 +/- 1.1, P < .05), and serum uric acid (355 +/- 98.0 vs 293 +/- 86.2, P < .05) than the hypertensive patients without PAD. After adjusting for gender, age, and other cardiovascular risk factors by using multiple logistical regression analysis, PAD was still associated with current smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-2.29), history of stroke (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.12-2.00), serum uric acid (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.59), and total cholesterol (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.59).\nThis study reports, for the first time, the prevalence of PAD in Chinese patients with hypertension, which is quite different from that in westerners, and that PAD is independently associated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of chronic venous disease in the lower limbs is unclear, and very limited data are available on potential risk factors from representative population studies.\nParticipants in the San Diego Population Study, a free-living adult population randomly selected from age, sex, and ethnic strata, were systematically assessed for risk factors for venous disease. Categorization of normal, moderate, and severe disease was determined hierarchically through clinical examination and ultrasonography imaging by trained vascular technologists, who also performed anthropometric measures. An interviewer administered a questionnaire and an examination assessed potential risk factors for venous disease suggested by previous reports.\nIn multivariable models, moderate venous disease was independently related to age, a family history of venous disease, previous hernia surgery, and normotension in both sexes. In men, current walking, the absence of cardiovascular disease, and not moving after sitting were also predictive. Additional predictors in women were weight, number of births, oophorectomy, flat feet, and not sitting. For severe disease, age, family history of venous disease, waist circumference, and flat feet were predictive in both sexes. In men, occupation as a laborer, cigarette smoking, and normotension were also independently associated with severe venous disease. Additional significant and independent predictors in women were hours standing, history of leg injury, number of births, and cardiovascular disease, but African American ethnicity was protective. Multiple other postulated risk factors for venous disease were not significant in multivariable analysis in this population.\nAlthough some risk factors for venous disease such as age, family history of venous disease, and findings suggestive of ligamentous laxity (hernia surgery, flat feet) are immutable, others can be modified, such as weight, physical activity, and cigarette smoking. Overall, these data provide modest support for the potential of behavioral risk-factor modification to prevent chronic venous disease.",

    "abstract": "Recently, practice guideline documents have recommended the completion of different levels of interventional experience and 5 or 10 thoracic endovascular aortic cases prior to surgeon credentialing. This study's purpose was to determine whether these requirements are valid by reviewing three surgeons' learning curves with thoracic aortic endovascular repairs.\nBetween 1998 and 2006, 67 patients underwent emergent or elective endovascular repair of thoracic aortic pathologies by one of three vascular surgeons with extensive experience with catheter manipulation and abdominal aortic endografts. Following standard retrospective review, each surgeon's learning curve was analyzed using the cumulative sum failure method with a target success rate of 95% derived from the literature. The main outcome variable was primary technical success.\nThese 67 patients presented with several pathologies including elective (n = 31) and ruptured (n = 11) thoracic aortic aneurysms, acute dissections or aortic ulcers (n = 10), and acute blunt thoracic aortic trauma (n = 15). The mean age was 65 (range: 20 to 90) and the early (30 day) mortality rate was 19.4% in urgent cases (n = 36) and 0% in elective cases (n = 31). Paraplegia occurred in two patients (3%). Primary technical success was achieved in 62 cases (92.5%) and did not differ between surgeons (92.6%, 91.3%, 94.1%, respectively; P = .9). Each surgeon's cases were plotted sequentially and the resulting learning curves were similar. Although acceptable outcomes were obtained throughout the study period, improved results, compared with the target success rate, were not achieved until each surgeon treated 5 to 10 patients.\nThis study supports the case volume requirements of the Society for Vascular Surgery credentialing guidelines, which also requires extensive catheter and guidewire experience. With this background in catheter manipulation and endovascular abdominal aortic repair, surgeons can achieve optimal outcomes with thoracic aortic lesions following 5 to 10 cases.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the current study was to share a 6-year experience with the iliac bifurcation device (IBD) and determine its safety and effectiveness in patients with common iliac artery aneurysms.\nBetween 2001 and 2006, 46 patients were prospectively enrolled in a single institution study on the IBD. Indications included unilateral or bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms (CIAA) (combined or not with abdominal aortic aneurysm endovascular repair). The first 26 patients were intended to receive a first generation unibody IBD and the following 20 patients the second generation, modular, IBD.\nIn 33 patients out of 46 attempted (technical success per patient 72%), 35 iliac bifurcated devices (2 patients received bilateral IBD) out of 51 attempted (technical success per vessel 69%), were successfully implanted. The technical success rate (per vessel) was 58% for the first generation device and 85% for the second generation device. Inability to introduce the side branch into the IIA and intraoperative occlusions were the main reasons for technical failure. Among these failures, only two patients required open conversions. The mean +/- SD follow-up (radiological and clinical) of the 33 patients with a total of 35 successful IBD implantations was 26 +/- 17 months (median 24, range 3 to 60). During the follow-up period out of 35 successfully-implanted iliac bifurcation devices, four (11%) hypogastric side branch occlusions occurred, all within the first 12 months. Cumulative IBD side branch patency was 87% at 60 months. Comparing the first with the second generation IBD outcomes, cumulative patency rates at 2 years revealed no statistical difference (P = .774). No endoleak, and particularly no IBD, modular side branch disconnection, no late rupture, or deaths have yet been encountered.\nPreservation of pelvic circulation in high risk patients treated for bilateral or unilateral common iliac aneurysms combined or without AAA is feasible and secure exclusively by endovascular repair. New generation iliac bifurcated devices show a favourable intraoperative performance and long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Femoropopliteal bypass still is the standard surgical therapy for disabling claudication and critical ischemia. When autologous vein is not suitable synthetic or biological prostheses may be considered. Second generation glutaraldehyde tanned human umbilical vein (HUV) graft was chosen for above and below knee femoropopliteal bypass when autologous vein was not available. A single center experience regarding long-term graft function, secondary reinterventions, and potential biodegeneration of the HUV is presented.\nBetween January 1994 and January 2005, 211 consecutive femoropopliteal bypass operations with HUV (65 above knee and 146 below knee) were performed in 197 patients for disabling claudication (57), chronic critical ischemia (130), popliteal artery aneurysm (9), acute ischemia (14), or aneurysmal degeneration of a synthetic graft (1) in the absence of suitable ipsilateral great saphenous vein. Grafts were followed with duplex scan supplemented by additional angiography in case of recurrent ischemia with prospective documentation of follow-up data in a computerized vascular database. Surveillance of the HUV included routine evaluation of potential biodegeneration with duplex scan. Retrospective analysis of graft patency, limb salvage, and signs of aneurysmal degeneration was performed.\nMean (median) follow-up was 44 (35) months (range 1 to 143 months). Thirty-day mortality was 2.4%. Early postoperative bypass thrombosis after a median of 4 days postoperatively (0 to 30 days) prompted revision with thrombectomy in 16% of cases. Besides late bypass thrombosis in 14.7%, additional operative or endovascular reinterventions during follow-up to maintain or restore graft patency was necessary in 8.5% of bypasses. Primary, primary assisted, secondary patency rate, and limb salvage rate after 5 years were 54%, 63%, 76%, and 92%, respectively, for all bypasses with no significant difference between above and below knee anastomosis. Duplex scan identified segmental aneurysmal degeneration in six grafts, which led to operative reintervention in three cases. The rate of detected aneurysm for grafts patent for more than three years was 7% with a rate of reintervention for aneurysm of 3.5%.\nAlthough a considerable rate of early thrombotic occlusions occurred, excellent secondary graft patency and limb salvage combined with a tolerable rate of late aneurysmal degeneration detected by means of duplex scan surveillance justify the use of the HUV in femoropopliteal bypass surgery when ipsilateral autogenous vein is not suitable.",

Besides late bypass thrombosis in 14.7%, additional operative or endovascular reinterventions during follow-up to maintain or restore graft patency was necessary in 8.5% of bypasses. Primary, primary assisted, secondary patency rate, and limb salvage rate after 5 years were 54%, 63%, 76%, and 92%, respectively, for all bypasses with no significant difference between above and below knee anastomosis. Duplex scan identified segmental aneurysmal degeneration in six grafts, which led to operative reintervention in three cases. The rate of detected aneurysm for grafts patent for more than three years was 7% with a rate of reintervention for aneurysm of 3.5%.",

    "abstract": "Level 1 evidence supports carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the standard treatment for severe (>70% lumen reduction) carotid stenosis in asymptomatic patients, though its safety and efficacy in high-risk patients remain controversial. Long-term survival and stroke-free survival after CEA may guide decisions concerning this procedure for asymptomatic patients, but this outcome has only been considered in few reports outside the large randomized trial setting. This study analyzed long-term survival and stroke-free survival after CEA and the impact of risk factors in a consecutive series of asymptomatic patients, including those with medical comorbidities and particular anatomical features believed to increase the perioperative morbidity and mortality of CEA.\nFor over 10 years, data were prospectively collected for all patients who underwent CEA for asymptomatic severe carotid disease at our institution. All CEAs performed by the same surgeon involved eversion technique, with patients under deep general anesthesia and continuous perioperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for selective shunting. All patients had neurological follow-up and duplex ultrasound at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. A complete follow-up (mean, 6.1 years; range, 0.1 to 10.6 years) was obtained in 348 patients (93%) with an overall 365 CEAs (93%). Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier life tables.\nAmong 374 patients undergoing 391 CEAs, there were no perioperative deaths or strokes. There were 17 (4.8%) late deaths, mainly cardiac-related (70%), and 2 (0.5%) non-fatal strokes. At 5 and 10 years, survival was 96.3% and 85.7%, and stroke-free survival was 95.6% and 84.8%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus (P = .002) and cardiac disease (P = .005) were independent predictors of a shorter long-term survival.\nEversion CEA proved safe and effective in a series of patients with asymptomatic severe carotid disease representing the typical population of daily clinical practice. Although long-term results were extremely favorable, excellent stroke-free survival was not translated into a longer patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Laser atherectomy offers a potential intervention for multivessel infrainguinal disease in patients with poor revascularization options. Despite promising early results reported in the literature, the proper patient population who might benefit from laser atherectomy has yet to be determined.\nFrom July 2004 to June 2006, patients undergoing laser atherectomy were retrospectively reviewed and assessed for comorbidities, operative and follow-up variables potentially associated with the end points of nondefinitive therapy, and limb salvage.\nDuring the study period, 40 patients (21 women, 19 men) underwent laser atherectomy, and the average follow-up was 461 +/- 49 days (range, 17 to 1050 days). Their average age was 68 +/- 2 years (range, 43 to 93 years). The indication for laser atherectomy was critical limb ischemia in 26 (65%) and lower limb claudication in 11 (35%). A total of 47 lesions were treated in the following arterial segments: 34 femoropopliteal and 13 infrapopliteal. Femoropopliteal distribution by the Trans-Atlantic Society Classification (TASC) was A in 3, B in 17, C in 10, D in 4, and infrapopliteal lesions distribution was A in 1, B in 3, C in 4, and D in 5. Adjunctive angioplasty was used in 75% of cases. The overall technical success rate (<50% residual stenosis) was 88%. Laser atherectomy-based treatment was the definitive therapy for 23 patients (58%), and the overall 12-month primary patency was 44%. The limb salvage rate at 12 months in 26 patients with critical limb ischemia was 55%. Renal failure was a risk factor for amputation (P < .001) and failed primary patency (P < .05), type 2 diabetes mellitus was a risk factor for amputation (P < .05), and poor tibial runoff was associated with failed primary patency and amputation (P < .05). Outcome was associated with the number of patent infrapopliteal runoff vessels.\nThese data demonstrate that laser atherectomy can be used with high initial technical success rate. Chronic renal failure and diabetes are risk factors for a negative outcome. Poor results in patients with diabetes and renal failure necessitate careful case selection in this subgroup, in which laser atherectomy is less likely to provide a definitive revascularization result or limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) is a proven diagnostic tool for the evaluation of carotid stenosis; however, its utility in planning carotid artery stenting (CAS) has not been addressed. This study assessed the accuracy of three-dimensional CE-MRA as a noninvasive screening tool, compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), for evaluating carotid and arch morphology before CAS.\nIn a series of 96 CAS procedures during a 2-year period, CE-MRAs and DSAs with complete visualization from the aortic arch to the intracranial circulation were obtained before CAS in 60 patients. Four additional patients, initially considered potential candidates for CAS, were also evaluated with CE-MRA and DSA. The two-by-two table method, receiver operating characteristic curve, and Bland-Altman analyses were used to characterize the ability of CE-MRA to discriminate carotid and arch anatomy, suitability for CAS, and degree of carotid stenosis.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of CE-MRA were, respectively, 100% and 100% to determine CAS suitability, 87% and 100% to define aortic arch type, 93% and 100% to determine severe carotid tortuosity, and 75% and 98% to detect ulcerated plaques. CE-MRA had 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of carotid stenosis >/=80%. The accuracy of CE MRA to determine optimal imaging angles and stent and embolic protection device sizes was >90%. The operative technique for CAS was altered because of the findings of preoperative CE-MRA in 22 procedures (38%). The most frequent change in the operative plan was the use of the telescoping technique in 11 cases (18%). CAS was aborted in four patients (5%) due to unfavorable anatomy identified on CE-MRA, including prohibitive internal carotid artery tortuosity (n = 1), long string sign of the internal carotid artery (n = 2), and concomitant intracranial disease (n = 1). Among patients considered suitable for CAS by CE-MRA, technical success was 100%, and the 30-day stroke/death rate was 1.6%.\nContrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of the arch and carotid arteries is accurate in determining suitability for CAS and may alter the operative technique. Certain anatomic contraindications for CAS may be detected without DSA. Although CE-MRA is less accurate to estimate the degree of stenosis, it can accurately predict imaging angles, and stent and embolic protection device size, which may facilitate safe and expeditious CAS.",

    "abstract": "Our prior study showed that resveratrol could suppress infarct volume and exert neuroprotective effect on rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) injury. Recently, it has been reported in some literature that resveratrol protects the spinal cord, kidney, and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through upregulation of nitric oxide (NO). Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the role of nitric oxide on the neuroprotective mechanisms of resveratrol on rats after FCI injury.\nThe FCI injury was induced by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion for 1 hour and then a 24-hour reperfusion followed in the anesthetized Long-Evans rats. Resveratrol was intravenously injected after 1 hour MCA occlusion.\nTreatment of resveratrol (0.1 and 1 microg/kg) decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma and malondialdehyde (MDA) in FCI injury brain tissue, whereas the level of NO in plasma was increased. In addition, resveratrol downregulated protein and mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and upregulated protein and mRNA expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), while the expression of protein and mRNA of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was unchanged. Pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, the nonselective NOS inhibitor) or L-N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO, the eNOS selective inhibitor) completely blocked the effect of resveratrol in decreasing infarction volumes.\nThis study demonstrated the important role of NO in the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol in FCI injury.",

    "abstract": "The relative safety of percutaneous carotid interventions remains controversial. Few studies have used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to evaluate the safety of these interventions. We compared the incidence and distribution of cerebral microembolic events after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with distal protection to standard open carotid endarterectomy (CEA) using DW-MRI.\nFrom November 2004 through August 2006, 69 carotid interventions (27 CAS, and 42 CEA) were performed in 68 males at a single institution. Pre- and postprocedure DW-MRI exams were obtained on each patient undergoing CAS and the 20 most recent CEA operations. These 46 patients (47 procedures as one patient underwent bilateral CEAs in a staged fashion) constitute our study sample, and the hospital records of these patients (27 CAS and 20 CEA) were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence and location of acute, postprocedural microemboli were determined using DW-MRIs and assessed independently by two neuroradiologists without knowledge of the subjects' specific procedure.\nNineteen CAS patients (70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 42%-81%) demonstrated evidence of postoperative, acute, cerebral microemboli by DW-MRI vs none of the CEA patients (0%, 95% CI: 0%-17%) (P < .0001). Of the 19 CAS patients with postoperative emboli, nine (47%) were ipsilateral to the index carotid lesion, three (16%) contralateral, and seven (36%) bilateral. The median number of ipsilateral microemboli identified in the CAS group was 1 (interquartile ranges [IQR]: 0-2, range 0-21). The median number of contralateral microemboli identified in the CAS group was 0 (IQR: 0-1, range 0-5). Three (11%) CAS patients experienced temporary neurologic sequelae lasting less than 36 hours. These patients suffered 12 (six ipsilateral and six contralateral), 20 (19 ipsilateral and one contralateral), and zero microemboli, respectively. By univariate analysis, performing an arch angiogram prior to CAS was associated with a higher risk of microemboli (median microemboli 5 vs none, P =.04)\nAlthough our early experience suggests that CAS may be performed safely (no permanent neurologic deficits following 27 consecutive procedures), cerebral microembolic events occurred in over two-thirds of the procedures despite the uniform use of distal protection. Open carotid surgery in this series seems to offer a lower risk of periprocedural microembolic events detected by DW-MRI.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the influence of diabetes mellitus and other factors on the outcome of all infrainguinal bypass grafts performed for occlusive disease by a single surgeon at a tertiary referral center.\nThe series includes 650 operations in 412 men and 238 women with median ages of 65 and 69 years, respectively. Critical ischemia was the indication for most procedures (n = 553, 85%), but 97 (15%) were done for claudication alone. Nearly half (n = 312, 48%) of the patients were diabetic, and 195 (30%) required insulin. All-autogenous vein was used for 389 grafts (60%). Synthetic or composite materials were employed for the remaining 261 grafts, 91 (35%) of which were entirely above the knee. Perioperative data were recorded contemporaneously and were supplemented by reviewing 558 of the 565 medical records and the Social Security Death Index. Survival, graft patency, and limb salvage were analyzed using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier estimates and proportional hazards models.\nDiabetics were more likely to have critical preoperative limb ischemia (P < .001), elevated serum creatinine (P = .003) or a history of previous coronary intervention (P = .015), lower extremity revascularization (P < .001) or minor amputations (P = .002). The operative mortality rate was 4.8%, and there were 81 graft occlusions (12%) and 49 major amputations (7.5%) during the index hospital admission. Patency was immediately restored in 46 of the 81 occluded grafts, but their secondary patency rates were only 62 +/- 16% at 1 year and 26 +/- 18% at 5 years. Insulin-dependent diabetes was associated with a higher incidence of early amputation (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.8; P = .004). Overall survival was 52 +/- 4% at 5 years and 25 +/- 5% at 10 years, and there were 175 late graft occlusions (27%), a total of 198 related reoperations and 107 late amputations (16%). The risks for further occlusion and/or major amputation after three or more graft revisions were 65% and 71%, respectively. Insulin-dependent diabetes also was associated with higher late mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P = .001) and amputation rates (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P = .026), but other independent variables like age, elevated serum creatinine, critical preoperative ischemia, synthetic conduits, and previous ipsilateral bypass had at least as much influence as diabetes on survival, graft failure or limb loss.\nDiabetes was one of several factors influencing survival and limb preservation, but it did not adversely affect graft patency. The number of graft revisions was an important predictor of further occlusion or amputation.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous laser (EVL) ablation of the great saphenous vein (GSV) is thought to minimize postoperative morbidity and reduce work loss compared with high ligation and stripping (HL/S). However, the procedures have not previously been compared in a randomized trial with parallel groups where both treatments were performed in tumescent anesthesia on an out-patient basis.\nPatients with varicose veins due to GSV insufficiency were randomized to either EVL (980 nm) or HL/S in tumescent anesthesia. Miniphlebectomies were also performed. Patients were examined preoperatively and at 12 days, and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Sick leave, time to normal physical activity, pain score, use of analgesics, Aberdeen score, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 quality-of-life score, Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and complication rates were investigated. The total cost of the procedures, including lost wages and equipment, was calculated. Cost calculations were based on the standard fee for HL/S with the addition of laser equipment and the standard salary and productivity level in Denmark.\nA follow-up of 6 months was achieved in 121 patients (137 legs). The groups were well matched for patient and GSV characteristics. Two HL/S procedures failed, and three GSVs recanalized in the EVL group. The groups experienced similar improvement in quality-of-life scores and VCSS score at 3 months. Only one patient in the HL/S group had a major complication, a wound infection that was treated successfully with antibiotics. The HL/S and EVL groups did not differ in mean time to resume normal physical activity (7.7 vs 6.9 calendar days) and work (7.6 vs 7.0 calendar days). Postoperative pain and bruising was higher in the HL/S group, but no difference in the use of analgesics was recorded. The total cost of the procedures, including lost wages, was euro 3084 ($3948 US) in the HL/S and euro 3396 ($4347 US) in the EVL group.\nThis study suggests that the short-term efficacy and safety of EVL and HL/S are similar. Except for slightly increased postoperative pain and bruising in the HL/S group, no differences were found between the two treatment modalities. The treatments were equally safe and efficient in eliminating GSV reflux, alleviating symptoms and signs of GSV varicosities, and improving quality of life. Long-term outcomes, particularly with respect to recurrence rates, shall be investigated in future studies, including the continuation of the present.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with an excessive risk for cardiovascular events and mortality. To determine measures prognostic of adverse events, ankle-brachial index (ABI) was compared with dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in patients referred to our vascular center for the evaluation of PAD.\nThe medical records of consecutive patients referred for the concurrent evaluation of PAD and coronary artery disease (CAD) between 1992 and 1995 were reviewed for subsequent cardiovascular events and death.\nAmong 395 patients (mean age, 69.7 +/- 9.6 years; 40% women), 341 had abnormal ABI and 268 had abnormal DSE (95 fixed and 173 stress-induced wall motion abnormalities).

By multivariate analysis, ABI provided the strongest prediction of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36 to 4.05; P = .002). Conversely, DSE with inducible or fixed wall motion abnormalities showed no association with cardiovascular events or increased mortality in multivariate analysis. The only DSE variable independently predictive of mortality was decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%) at peak stress (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.36; P = .002). Statin and aspirin therapy, but not beta-blockers, were protective. There was no relation between ABI and wall motion index score at rest or after stress.\nIn high-risk patients referred to our vascular center for the evaluation of PAD, the assessment of ABI provided a strong independent prediction of all-cause mortality. Therefore, proper interpretation of this simple, affordable, and reproducible measure extends beyond the assessment of PAD severity. Although a poor left ventricular response to dobutamine was also predictive, other echo variables were not.",

The balloon-expandable component expanded the area of stenosis and also created a neck to allow the implantation of the self-expandable endograft to exclude the aneurysm. Mismatch of diameters was solved with the creation of a new proximal neck, in which the distal end was progressively expanded to reach the appropriate diameter to implant the self-expandable endograft inside. Expansion of the narrow stenosis and complete exclusion of the aneurysm was achieved without a residual pressure gradient.",

Connections between the adventitial cyst and the nearby joint have been reported in the literature that support the developmental theory. This theory suggests that cystic adventitial disease is a developmental manifestation of mucin-secreting cells derived from the mesenchyme of the adjacent joint.

    "abstract": "A progressively enlarging left common iliac artery aneurysm developed in a 72-year-old man 7 years after open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a bifurcated Dacron graft. Because both the right hypogastric and inferior mesenteric arteries had been ligated at the initial operation, preservation of left hypogastric flow was critical to avoid pelvic or intestinal ischemia. He was a poor open surgical candidate owing to obesity, a hostile abdomen, and multiple medical comorbidities. Therefore, a novel hybrid approach was used consisting of left transbrachial selective left hypogastric artery catheterization, followed by deployment of two, overlapping, antegrade, covered stent grafts extending from the proximal left graft limb into the left hypogastric artery. A right-to-left femorofemoral crossover bypass was added to perfuse the left lower extremity and was performed in end-to-end fashion to the left common femoral artery to exclude and prevent retrograde flow into the iliac aneurysm. Also presented are potential procedural pitfalls and a detailed review of open, endovascular and hybrid options to preserve hypogastric flow when treating iliac aneurysms in complex, high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Clinical outcome of vascular bypass surgery using autologous vein graft is limited by neointimal formation associated with vein graft failure. Because inflammatory changes are one of the main pathologic features of vein graft failure, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) might therefore underlie in the mechanism of vein graft failure. There is no direct evidence, however, that shows the benefits of local anti-MCP-1 therapy as a novel molecular approach for prevention of vein graft failure.\nTo block MCP-1, we used an N-terminal deletion mutant of the MCP-1 gene (7ND), which lacks the N-terminal amino acids 2 to 8, binds to its receptor CCR2, and blocks MCP-1-mediated monocyte chemotaxis. 7ND works as dominant-negative inhibitor of MCP-1. Autologous canine jugular vein grafts were transfected by incubating them ex vivo in a solution with or without adenovirus vectors containing 7ND gene or LacZ gene, and interposed into the carotid arteries.\nAdenovirus-mediated gene transfer of 7ND, but not LacZ gene transfer, significantly attenuated inflammation (monocyte infiltration per mm2 on day 7: 328+/-59, 220+/-11, 26+/-4 in control, LacZ, and 7ND groups, respectively, P<.05, n=4 each) and proliferation (appearance of proliferating cells per mm2 on day 7: 1005+/-186, 756+/-106, 252+/-27 in control, LacZ, and 7ND groups, P<.05, n=4 each) at 7 days after the operation and thus suppressed neointimal formation (neointimal area in mm2 on day 28: 1.63+/-0.51, 1.96+/-0.48, 0.68+/-0.10 in control, LacZ, and 7ND groups, P<.05, n=4 each). This strategy also attenuated upregulation of MCP-1 activities but did not affect endothelial regeneration process.\nBlockade of MCP-1 by adenoviral gene transfer of 7ND limits neointimal formation associated with vein graft failure in dogs. This study highlights the potential therapeutic benefit of local anti-MCP-1 therapy for prevention of neointimal formation associated with vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Stents are increasingly used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. We studied the effects of stenting and endothelial denudation on aneurysm and branch vessel occlusion.\nBilateral lingual bifurcation venous pouch aneurysms were created in eight dogs, surgically scraping the aneurysmal endothelial lining on one side. Both arteries were immediately stented using balloon-expandable stents. In four other dogs, a wide-neck carotid bifurcation aneurysm was created, with the vein pouch denuded or not (n=2 each), followed by immediate stenting. Results were compared using angiography and pathology at 10 days (n=2), 10 (n=8), and 20 weeks (n=2). Branch occlusion between initial and final angiograms was recorded. Pathological evaluation of aneurysms was studied, with attention to neointima formation at the aneurysm ostium and around branch vessel origins.\nAll stented and denuded lingual aneurysms were obliterated compared with two of eight lingual aneurysms that were stented alone (P=.007). None of the carotid bifurcation aneurysms became obliterated (0/4), but denuded aneurysms showed partial thrombosis (2/2). Of 68 total stent-covered branches, 5 (7%) were occluded and 17 (27%) had altered angiographic flow.\nStenting led to suboptimal results in the presence of an intact endothelial layer. Endothelial denudation can promote aneurysm occlusion when combined with stenting.",

    "abstract": "Although the management of vascular injury in coalition forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom has been described, there are no reports on the in-theater treatment of wartime vascular injury in the local population. This study reports the complete management of extremity vascular injury in a local wartime population and illustrates the unique aspects of this cohort and management strategy.\nFrom September 1, 2004, to August 31, 2006, all vascular injuries treated at the Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) in Balad, Iraq, were registered. Those in noncoalition troops were identified and retrospectively reviewed.\nDuring the study period, 192 major vascular injuries were treated in the local population in the following distribution: extremity 70% (n=134), neck and great vessel 17% (n=33), and thoracoabdominal 13% (n=25). For the extremity cohort, the age range was 4 to 68 years and included 12 pediatric injuries. Autologous vein was the conduit of choice for these vascular reconstructions. A strict wound management strategy providing repeat operative washout and application of the closed negative pressure adjunct was used. Delayed primary closure or secondary coverage with a split-thickness skin graft was required in 57% of extremity wounds. All patients in this cohort remained at the theater hospital through definitive wound healing, with an average length of stay of 15 days (median 11 days). Patients required an average of 3.3 operations (median 3) from the initial injury to definitive wound closure. Major complications in extremity vascular patients, including mortality, were present in 15.7% (n=21). Surgical wound infection occurred in 3.7% (n=5), and acute anastomotic disruption in 3% (n=4). Graft thrombosis occurred in 4.5% (n=6), and early amputation and mortality rates during the study period were 3.0% (n=4) and 1.5% (n=2), respectively.\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the first large report of wartime extremity vascular injury management in a local population. These injuries present unique challenges related to complex wounds that require their complete management to occur in-theater. Vascular reconstruction using vein, combined with a strict wound management strategy, results in successful limb salvage with remarkably low infection, amputation and mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "This cohort study was conducted to determine the effect on walking distances of supervised exercise therapy provided in a community-based setting.\nThe study included all consecutive patients presenting at the vascular outpatient clinic with intermittent claudication, diagnosed by a resting ankle brachial index<0.9, who had no previous peripheral vascular intervention for peripheral arterial disease, no major amputation, and sufficient command of the Dutch language. The exclusion criterion was the inability to walk the baseline treadmill test for a minimum of 10 m. The intervention was a supervised exercise therapy in a community-based setting. A progressive treadmill test at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up measured initial claudication distance and absolute claudication distance. Changes were calculated using the mean percentages of change.\nFrom January through October 2005, 93 consecutive patients with claudication were eligible. Overall, 37 patients discontinued the supervised exercise therapy program. Eleven stopped because of intercurrent diseases, whereas for 10, supervised exercise therapy did not lead to adequate improvement and they underwent a vascular intervention. Three patients quit the program, stating that they were satisfied with the regained walking distance and did not require further supervised exercise therapy. Ten patients were not motivated sufficiently to continue the program, and in three patients, a lack of adequate insurance coverage was the reason for dropping out. Data for 56 patients were used and showed a mean percentage increase in initial claudication distance of 187% after 3 months and 240% after 6 months. The mean percentage of the absolute claudication distance increased 142% after 3 months and 191% after 6 months.\nSupervised exercise therapy in a community-based setting is a promising approach to providing conservative treatment for patients with intermittent claudication.",

The prevalence of any PAD was 7.9% in the age group 60 to 65 years and increased to 47.2% among the age group 85 to 90 years. Severe limb ischemia occurred in 0.3% in the youngest age group, was highest in the age group 80 to 84 years at 3.3%, and declined to 2.5% among the oldest. The prevalence of PAD differed between regions (P<.0001).\nPAD is common in Sweden, and almost a fifth of all elderly individuals have some stage of this disease.

    "abstract": "Impaired physical function is a feature of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who present with symptoms of intermittent claudication (PAD-IC). Previous research found that temporal-spatial gait parameters do not discriminate between PAD-IC patients and control subjects during normal and maximal walking even though PAD-IC patients have decreased physical function characteristic of the disease. This study examined the hypothesis that patients with PAD-IC would demonstrate decreased temporal-spatial gait parameters, gait kinematics, walking performance, physiologic responses to exercise, and physical activity level compared with control subjects. The aim was to examine the temporal-spatial gait parameters and gait kinematics of individuals with PAD-IC and to determine the relationship between these variables and walking performance, exercise capacity, and physical activity level in these individuals.\nA cross-sectional study of 28 PAD-IC subjects (IC) and 25 controls (CON) matched for age and mass was conducted in a medical faculty human performance laboratory. IC subjects had a history of PAD, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI)<0.9 in at least one leg, and a positive Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire response. Gait characteristics were determined by two-dimensional motion analysis. A graded treadmill test was used to assess walking performance and peak physiologic responses to exercise. Physical activity levels were measured by analysis of 7-day pedometer recording motion. Differences between groups were examined by one-way analysis of covariance.\nCompared with CON, IC temporal-spatial gait parameters were significantly lower (P<.05), except for single support ipsilateral limb time. IC subjects spent a greater percentage of time in gait support phases, took longer to complete a stride, and had reduced stride length and walking speeds during the gait cycle. IC joint angular kinematics showed significantly reduced displacement of ankle plantar flexion (P=.017), knee range of motion (P=.021), and hip extension (P=.016) compared with the CON subjects during the gait cycle. All joint minimum and maximum angular velocities and accelerations, walking physiologic responses, and physical activity levels were significantly lower for IC compared with the CON subjects.\nIC subjects walk with a shuffling gait pattern indicated by reduced joint angular displacement, velocities, and accelerations that results in reduced walking performance and physiologic responses and physical activity compared with controls matched for age, mass, and physical activity.",

    "abstract": "The hemodynamic effects of carotid angioplasty with stent placement (CAS) on the collateral blood supply and on the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) have not been established. Recently, arterial spin-labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been introduced as the first method to quantify the actual territorial contribution of individual collateral arteries as well as to noninvasively measure rCBF. This study investigated alterations in flow territories and rCBF in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and compared them with healthy control subjects. In addition, we investigated whether possible differences in flow territories and rCBF were present between patients undergoing CAS and patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nThe study included 24 consecutive patients (15 men and 9 women; age 67+/-9 years) with symptomatic ICA stenosis. CAS was performed in 12 patients, and 12 patients underwent CEA. Flow territory mapping and rCBF measurements were performed with ASL MRI before intervention and 1 month after. The control group consisted of 40 subjects (25 men and 15 women; age 67+/-8 years).\nThe flow territory of the ipsilateral ICA in patients with ICA stenosis was smaller, and the territories of the contralateral ICA and vertebrobasilar arteries were larger compared with control subjects (P<.05). After CAS, rCBF in the ipsilateral hemisphere increased from 60.2+/-16.9 mL/(min.100 g) to 68.9+/-9.2 mL/(min.100 g) (P<.05). Differences in flow territories and rCBF between patients and control subjects disappeared after CAS. Changes in flow territories and rCBF were similar in patients who underwent CAS or CEA.\nCAS results in a normalization of the territorial distribution and rCBF, as assessed by ASL MRI. The degree of improvement is similar to that seen after CEA.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have indicated that some patient subpopulations do not respond to the antithrombotic effects of aspirin. The objective of this study was to evaluate aspirin-induced inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX) using a flow cytometric technique in long-term aspirin users after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and controls with newly diagnosed carotid stenosis not taking aspirin and to compare these results with platelet function analyzer measurements.\nThe study included 86 patients with a history of CEA on long-term aspirin therapy (100 mg daily) and 29 age-matched patients with newly diagnosed carotid artery stenosis not taking aspirin. Platelet-rich plasma diluted with phosphate-buffered saline was incubated with arachidonic acid (ARA) at a final concentration of 80 micromol/L. After staining with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin (CD62p) antibody, platelet CD62p-antigen expression was measured on a flow cytometer.\nFlow cytometric measurement of ARA-induced platelet activation showed an inhibition of ARA-induced platelet stimulation in all patients on aspirin therapy, whereas all but two controls (95%) showed expected platelet reactivity. In contrast, results of the platelet function analyzer measurements were normal in 16% of aspirin-treated patients.\nFlow cytometric measurement of CD62p expression on platelets after incubation with ARA proved to be a practicable tool to monitor aspirin-induced inhibition of platelet COX. Results in patients on long-term low-dose aspirin therapy show that the inability of aspirin to inhibit platelet COX for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis is a very rare event. So-called aspirin resistance detected quite frequently by platelet function analyzer measurement is most likely from COX-independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting is emerging as an attractive alternative to surgical endarterectomy for the treatment of carotid artery disease. This study reports our initial experience using the radial artery as access for carotid stenting.\nA retrospective study was performed in which 20 consecutive patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy underwent carotid stenting with cerebral protection using radial artery access. All procedures were performed in the operating room from March 2006 to December 2006. Seven lesions were symptomatic, and 13 lesions were asymptomatic. Patients were evaluated for development of stroke or transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, access site complications, procedural success, time to patient mobilization, and need for intravenous analgesia.\nProcedural success was achieved in 18 patients (90%). Intense radial artery vasospasm resulted in one failure, and the second failure occurred in a patient with a left-sided carotid lesion and type I arch. The 30-day incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and death was 0%. Radial artery occlusion only occurred in the one patient because of the development of intense vasospasm during the procedure. One patient had persistent local pain requiring intravenous medication for relief. All patients were mobilized <or=2 hours of intervention and were discharged on the first postoperative day.\nCarotid artery stenting with cerebral protection devices can be safely and effectively performed, with acceptable morbidity and high technical success, by using radial artery access. We recommend obtaining imaging of the aortic arch and supra-aortic trunks with computed tomography, as well as a duplex scan of radial artery, before attempting carotid artery stenting using radial artery access. Further study is needed before recommending that femoral access be replaced by radial access for carotid artery intervention.",

    "abstract": "The hybrid approach to the repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA), consisting of visceral aortic debranching with retrograde revascularization of the splanchnic and renal arteries and aneurysm exclusion using stent grafts, has been previously described and may be considered particularly appealing in high-risk patients, especially those who have undergone prior aortic surgery. This study analyzed prospectively recorded data of a series of high-risk patients with prior aortic surgery who underwent hybrid TAAA repair at our institute and contrasted the outcomes with those of a similar group of patients who underwent conventional open TAAA repair.\nBetween 2001 and 2006, 13 patients (12 men) with a median age of 69.6 years (range, 35 to 82 years) underwent one-stage hybrid repair of TAAA (7 type I, 2 type II, 2 type IV, and 2 aneurysms of the visceral aortic patch). These patients, the hybrid group, had a history of aortic surgery (30.7% ascending, 30.7% descending, 46.1% abdominal aortic repair, and 15.4% redo TAAA) and were at high risk for open repair. The criteria used to define these patients as high risk and to indicate the need for hybrid treatment were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3 or 4 associated with a preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)<50%. In all cases, we accomplished partial or total visceral aortic debranching through (1) a previous visceral artery retrograde revascularization with synthetic grafts (single bypass, customized Y or bifurcated grafts), and (2) aortic endovascular repair with one of three different commercially produced stent grafts (Cook, W.L. Gore & Assoc, and Medtronic). We analyzed the results and compared the outcomes of the hybrid group with those of a similar group of 29 patients (25 men) with a median age 65.3 years (range, 58 to 79) selected from our overall series of 246 TAAA repairs between 1988 and 2005. These 29 patients, the conventionally treated group, were selected for having had aortic surgery (22% ascending, 38% descending, 42% abdominal aortic repair, and 10.3% redo TAAA), an ASA 3 or 4, a preoperative FEV1<50%, and a conventional open repair of TAAA (10 type I, 5 type II, 4 type III, 7 type IV, and 3 aneurysms of the visceral aortic patch).\nIn the hybrid group, 32 visceral bypasses were completed and endovascular TAAA repair was successful in all cases. No intraoperative deaths occurred. Perioperative mortality was 23%, and morbidity was 30.8% (renal failure in 2, respiratory failure in 1, and delayed transient paraplegia in 1). At a median follow-up of 14.9 months (range, 11 days to 59.4 months), all grafts were patent at postoperative computed tomography angiography and no aneurysm-related deaths, endoleak, stent graft migration, or morbidity related to visceral revascularization had occurred. No conventionally treated patients died intraoperatively. Perioperative mortality was 17.2% and morbidity was 44.8% (respiratory failure in 7, coagulopathy in 1, renal failure in 2, and paraplegia in 3). At a median follow-up of 5.4 years (range, 1.7 to 7.9 years), no significant complications related to aortic repair occurred, except for three patients (10.3%) with asymptomatic dilatation of the visceral aortic patch<5 cm undergoing radiologic surveillance.\nHybrid TAAA repair is technically feasible in selected cases. Perioperative morbidity and mortality were considerable in our subset of high-risk patients with prior aortic surgery, but no aneurysm-related or procedure-related complications were reported at mid-term follow-up. Hybrid TAAA repair did not lead to a significant improvement in outcomes compared with open TAAA repair in a similar group of patients. Larger series are required for valid statistical comparisons and longer follow-ups are necessary to evaluate the durability of hybrid repairs.",

The mean systemic pressure was 117 mm Hg. The mean intrasac pressure before embolization was 75 mm Hg (range, 39 to 125 mm Hg), 16.5 mm Hg (range, 7 to 40 mm Hg) in 10 patients after embolization, and it increased in one patient. CT scans at 24 hours showed stable contrast medium inside the sac in 10 patients. Only minor complications were observed during follow-up. At the 1-year follow-up, no recurrence of leaks was noted, and sac diameter was reduced in 10 of 11 patients. As a result, TTE clinical success was obtained in 10 (83%) of 12 patients.\nTTE appears to be a feasible technique for the complete exclusion of type II endoleaks.

    "abstract": "Although the mainstay of managing acute descending thoracic aortic dissection (ADTAD) remains medical, certain patients will require emergency surgery for complications of rupture or ischemia. This study evaluates factors that affect outcome and determines which patients previously treated surgically would have been eligible for endovascular repair.\nA single-institution retrospective study was conducted of patients who presented with clinical signs of ADTAD that was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography (CT). All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and medically managed to maintain systolic blood pressure<120 mm Hg and heart rate<70 beats/min. Two treatment groups were identified: group 1 received medical treatment only; group 2 received medical treatment plus emergency surgery. Patient demographic and clinical data were correlated with 30-day group mortality and morbidity and need for emergency surgery. The MRA and CT scan images of group 2 were retrospectively reviewed to determine if currently available endovascular treatment could have been done. The Fisher exact test was used to compare between the groups, and P<.05 was considered significant.\nBetween 1991 and 2005, 83 patients (55 men) were treated for ADTAD. The mean age was 67 years (range, 38 to 85). Sixty-eight patients (82%) had hypertension, three (3.6%) had Marfan syndrome, and 51 (62%) were smokers. Twenty-five (32%) of the patients were receiving beta-blocker therapy before the onset of their symptoms. Back pain was the most common initial symptom (72.2%). Emergency surgery was required in 19 patients (23%): 12 for rupture or impending rupture, four for mesenteric ischemia, and three for lower extremity ischemia. The need for emergency surgery was significantly higher in smokers (P=.03), in patients>70 years old (P=.035), and in patients who were not receiving beta-blocker therapy before the onset of symptoms (P=.023). The combined overall morbidity rate was 33%, and the mortality rate was 9.6%. Morbidity in group 2 was 64% and significantly higher than the 23% in group 1 (P=.00227). The mortality rate was also higher in group 2 at 31.5% compared with group 1 at 1.6% (P=.0004). Factors affecting the overall mortality included age>70 years (P=.057), previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (P=.018), tobacco use (P=.039), and the presence of leg pain at initial presentation (P=.013). As determined from the review of radiologic data, 11 of 13 patients with scans available for review in group 2 could have been treated with currently available endovascular grafts.\nIntensive medical therapies are effective in preventing early mortality associated with ADTAD. Predictably, the need for emergency surgery carries a high morbidity and mortality rate. Most patients in this series requiring emergency surgery could have been candidates for endovascular therapy had it been available.",

    "abstract": "Objective scoring systems have been developed for risk stratification of open infrarenal aneurysm repair. To date, none have been applied for the selection of patients who would most benefit from either an open or an endovascular approach. This study assessed the utility of comorbidity-based objective scoring systems for defining subgroups of patients who might most benefit from open or endovascular aneurysm repair.\nA retrospective database review was performed for the period January 1999 to December 2004 to identify patients who had undergone elective open aneurysm repair (open repair) or elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Validation of the Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS), the Modified Leiden Score (M-LS), and the Modified Comorbidity Severity Score (M-CSS) was performed for perioperative mortality risk in the open repair group. GAS, M-LS, and M-CSS were then calculated for the EVAR group. Differences in open repair vs EVAR mortalities were evaluated.\nDuring the time period, 558 patients underwent open repair and 304 underwent EVAR. Overall mortality was 4.7% for open repair patients and 2.0% for EVAR. All three scoring systems were validated to our open repair data set (C statistic: GAS, 0.72; M-LS, 0.71; M-CSS, 0.74). A score was calculated for each system that separated patients into groups of either low or high risk of death for open repair. This score (cut point) was 76.5 for the GAS, 5.2 for the M-LS, and 8 for the M-CSS. Analysis of the EVAR population revealed that patients at low medical risk for open repair did not derive statistically significant mortality benefit with EVAR; however, patients at high medical risk for open repair derived significant benefit from EVAR (GAS>76.5 mortality: open repair, 7.8%; EVAR, 1.9% [P<.01]; M-LS mortality: open repair, 8.1%; EVAR, 2.5% [P<.01]; and M-CSS mortality: open repair, 10.3%; EVAR, 3.4% [P<.025]). Despite a very small number of deaths (n=6), receiver operator curve analysis identified M-LS and M-CSS as having some predictive ability for mortality risk with EVAR (C statistic: M-LS, 0.70; M-CSS, 0.69).\nThree validated objective scoring systems can be used to categorize patients into two groups of medical risk: one that has excellent outcome with open repair and derives no early mortality benefit from EVAR, and another that has significant mortality with open repair and derives important benefit with EVAR.",

All three scoring systems were validated to our open repair data set (C statistic: GAS, 0.72; M-LS, 0.71; M-CSS, 0.74). A score was calculated for each system that separated patients into groups of either low or high risk of death for open repair. This score (cut point) was 76.5 for the GAS, 5.2 for the M-LS, and 8 for the M-CSS. Analysis of the EVAR population revealed that patients at low medical risk for open repair did not derive statistically significant mortality benefit with EVAR; however, patients at high medical risk for open repair derived significant benefit from EVAR (GAS>76.5 mortality: open repair, 7.8%; EVAR, 1.9% [P<.01]; M-LS mortality: open repair, 8.1%; EVAR, 2.5% [P<.01]; and M-CSS mortality: open repair, 10.3%; EVAR, 3.4% [P<.025]). Despite a very small number of deaths (n=6), receiver operator curve analysis identified M-LS and M-CSS as having some predictive ability for mortality risk with EVAR (C statistic: M-LS, 0.70; M-CSS, 0.69).",

    "abstract": "Microembolization detected during the dissection phase of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is associated with plaque instability and might be associated with perioperative morbidity. Intraplaque hemorrhage is found in unstable plaques and is detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to ascertain whether intraplaque hemorrhage as seen on carotid MRI predicts particulate embolization in the dissection phase of CEA.\nPatients with high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing CEA were prospectively enrolled. All underwent preoperative MRI assessment of the carotid arteries for intraplaque hemorrhage and transcranial Doppler scanning during the dissection phase of the CEA to assess the presence of microembolic signals. Associations between intraplaque hemorrhage and intraoperative microembolic signals were studied.\nAnalysis was undertaken on 60 participants; of these, 36 (60%) showed ipsilateral carotid MRI intraplaque hemorrhage, and 24 (40%) did not. Microembolic signals were detected during the dissection phase in 23 (38.3%) participants, and 19 had MRI-detected intraplaque hemorrhage. The association between carotid intraplaque hemorrhage and the presence of dissection phase microembolic signals was significant (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 19.7, P = .007), even after controlling for age, sex, individual surgeon, degree of stenosis, and delay from symptom to CEA (adjusted OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 30.4, P = .037).\nIntraplaque hemorrhage as detected by carotid MRI predicts particulate embolization during the dissection phase of CEA. This imaging technique can be used to identify patients with increased intraoperative thromboembolic risk, and this could influence preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences.\nThis prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic.\nAll patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without.\nLocal anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Although autogenous brachial-basilic upper arm transpositions (BVT) have been extensively utilized, there has been significant disparity in published patency rates. Very little is known about the efficacy of autogenous brachial-cephalic upper arm transpositions (CVT). We evaluated our experience with transposed upper arm arteriovenous fistulas (tAVF) in order to assess patency and identify factors that affect efficacy. We then compared our tAVF patients with a cohort of upper arm arteriovenous grafts (AVG).\nA retrospective review was conducted of tAVF performed at our institution from 1998 to 2004. The tAVF group consisted of 119 BVT and 71 CVT procedures. We compared these with 164 AVG. tAVF were placed only for veins >/=2.5 mm in diameter by duplex ultrasonography.\nMean follow-up was 28 months. With the exception of mean vein diameter, the patients in the BVT and CVT groups had similar demographic parameters and complication rates. Primary and secondary patency rates were 52% and 62% at 5 years for BVT and 40% and 46% at 5 years for CVT, respectively (P = NS). Multivariate analysis revealed that hemodialysis dependence at the time of fistula placement and history of previous upper arm access independently affected primary patency. History of upper torso dialysis catheters independently affected secondary patency. Comparison of the tAVF and AVG groups revealed that tAVF patients were significantly younger, more likely to be male, less likely to be African American (AA) and less likely to have a history of previous AV access. The primary patency rate for tAVF was significantly higher than for AVG: 48% vs 14% at 5 years (P < .001). The secondary patency rate for tAVF was also significantly higher than for AVG: 57% vs 17% at 5 years (P < .001). Among the tAVF procedures, 9% required one or more revisions to maintain secondary patency, compared to 51% with the AVG group (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that presence of AVG and a history of previous upper arm access negatively affected primary and secondary patency.\nAutogenous BVT and CVT have similar, high patency rates. Transposed upper arm arteriovenous fistulas have higher patency rates than upper arm AVG and require significantly fewer revisions. Our data strongly support the contention that as long as the patient is a candidate for an upper arm tAVF, based on anatomical criteria, a tAVF should always be considered before an AVG.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 endoleak occurs in up to 20% of patients after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), but its long-term significance is debated. We reviewed our experience to evaluate late outcomes associated with type 2 endoleak.\nDuring the interval January 1994 to December 2005, 873 patients underwent EVAR. Computed tomography (CT) scan assessment was performed < or =1 month of the operation and at least annually thereafter. Sequential 6-month CT scan follow-up was adopted for those patients with persistent type 2 endoleaks, and reintervention was limited to those with sac enlargement >5 mm. Study end points included overall survival, aneurysm sac growth, reintervention rate, conversion to open repair, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture. Preoperative variables and anatomic factors potentially associated with these endpoints were assessed using multivariate analysis.\nWe identified 164 (18.9%) patients with early (at the first follow-up CT scan) type 2 endoleaks. Mean follow-up was 32.6 months. In 131 (79.9%) early type 2 endoleaks, complete and permanent leak resolution occurred < or =6 months. Endoleaks persisted in 33 patients (3.8% of total patients; 20.1% of early type 2 endoleaks) for >6 months. Transient type 2 endoleak (those that resolved < or =6 months of EVAR) was not associated with adverse late outcomes. In contrast, persistent endoleak was associated with several adverse outcomes. AAA-related death was not significantly different between patients with and without a type 2 endoleak (P = .78). When evaluating patients with no early endoleak vs persistent endoleak, freedom from sac expansion at 1, 3, and 5 years was 99.2%, 97.6%, and 94.9% (no leak) vs 88.1%, 48.0%, and 28.0% (persistent) (P < .001). Patients with persistent endoleak were at increased risk for aneurysm sac growth vs patients without endoleak (odds ratio [OR], 25.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.8 to 57.4; P < .001). Patients with a persistent endoleak also had a significantly increased rate of reintervention (OR, 19.0; 95% CI, 8.0 to 44.7); P < .001). Finally, aneurysm rupture occurred in 4 patients with type 2 endoleaks. Freedom from rupture at 1, 3, and 5 years for patients with a persistent type 2 endoleak was 96.8%, 96.8%, and 91.1% vs 99.8%, 98.5%, and 97.4% for patients without a type 2 endoleak. Multivariate analysis demonstrated persistent type 2 endoleak to be a significant predictor of aneurysm rupture (P = .03).\nPersistent type 2 endoleak is associated with an increased incidence of adverse outcomes, including aneurysm sac growth, the need for conversion to open repair, reintervention rate, and rupture. These data suggest that patients with persistent type 2 endoleak (>6 months) should be considered for more frequent follow-up or a more aggressive approach to reintervention.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the initial hospital cost associated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is approximately $20,000. However, the cost of long-term surveillance and secondary procedures is poorly characterized.\nBetween December 1998 and June 2006, 259 patients underwent EVAR for infrarenal aneurysms at a single institution. Follow-up costs were calculated using a relative value unit based hospital cost accounting system, which incorporates departmental direct and indirect costs. Institutional overhead costs were included using a conversion factor. Costs for professional services were determined by a cost-to-charge ratio, and outpatient visits were calculated with a time-based formula. Year 2006 costs were applied to prior years. To minimize costs associated with the early learning curve, the initial 50 EVAR patients between December 1995 and 1998 were excluded. Patients with <1 year follow-up were also excluded. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard error.\nThe mean follow-up after EVAR for 136 patients was 34.7 +/- 1.8 months. The cumulative 5-year postplacement cost per patient was $11,351. The 27 patients (19.9%) who required secondary procedures had a 5-year cumulative cost of $31,696 compared with $3668 for 109 patients without secondary procedures (8.6-fold increase, P < .05). The 5-year cost for patients with endoleak was $26,739 compared with $5706 for those without endoleak (4.7-fold increase, P < .05). Overall, major cost components were 57.4% for secondary procedures and 32.5% for radiologic studies.\nDuring a 5-year period, the postplacement cost of EVAR increases the global cost by 44%. The subgroups of patients with endoleaks and those requiring secondary procedures generate a disproportionate share of postplacement costs. Efforts at minimizing cost should emphasize technical and device modifications aimed at reducing endoleaks and the need for secondary procedures.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA] with stenting) has been increasingly applied in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) to avoid morbidities associated with open repair (OR). The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of PTA/Stent vs OR in patients with symptomatic CMI.\nDuring the interval of January 1991 to December 2005, 80 consecutive patients presenting with symptomatic CMI underwent elective revascularization. Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia or those with mesenteric revascularization performed as part of complex aneurysm repair were excluded. PTA/Stent (with stenting in 87%) was the initial procedure in 31 patients (42 vessels). OR was performed in 49 patients (88 vessels) and consisted of bypass grafting in 31 (63%), transaortic endarterectomy in 7 (14%), patch angioplasty in 4 (8%), or combined in 7 (15%). Mean follow-up was 15 months in the PTA/Stent group and 42 months in the OR cohort. Study end points included perioperative morbidity, mortality, late survival (Kaplan-Meier), and symptomatic and radiographic recurrence.\nBaseline comorbidities, with the exception of heart disease (P=.025) and serum albumin<3.5 g/dL (P=.025), were similar between PTA/Stent and OR patients. The PTA/Stent group had fewer vessels revascularized (1.5 vs 1.8 vessels, P=.001). Hospital length of stay was less for the PTA/Stent group (5.6 vs 16.7 days, P=.001). No difference was noted in in-hospital major morbidity (4/31 vs 2/49, P=.23) or mortality (1/31 vs 1/49, P=.74). Actuarial survival at 2 years was similar between the groups (88% PTA/Stent vs 74% OR, P=.28). There was no difference in the incidence of symptomatic (7/31 [23%] vs 11/49 [22%], P=.98) or radiographic recurrence (10/31 [32%] vs 18/49 [37%], P=.40) between the two groups. Radiographic primary patency (58% vs 90%, P=.001) and primary assisted patency (65% vs 96%, P<.001) at 1 year were lower in the PTA/Stent group compared with OR. Five (16%) of 31 PTA/Stent patients compared with 11 (22%) of 49 OR patients required a second intervention on at least one index vessel at any time (P=.49).\nSymptomatic recurrence requiring reintervention is common (overall 16/80 [20%]) after open and endovascular treatment for CMI. PTA/Stent was associated with decreased primary patency, primary assisted patency, and the need for earlier reintervention. In-hospital mortality or major morbidity were similar in patients undergoing PTA/Stent and OR. These findings suggest that OR and PTA/Stent should be applied selectively in CMI patients in accordance with individual patient anatomic and comorbidity considerations.",

Outcome was assessed by patient satisfaction analysis and quantitative evaluation of photographs taken from the lateral aspect of the thigh before and again at 52 days on the average after sclerotherapy by two blinded expert reviewers. Patients completed a quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) before treatment and again at the control.\nData of 96 of 100 randomized patients could be evaluated. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of treatment was similar in the two groups. Objective assessment of clinical vessel disappearance revealed a benefit of wearing stockings (P=.026) corresponding to a NNT (number needed to treat) of 4.7 patients to get a vessel disappearance score higher than 6. The interobserver agreement was very high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.93). Compression was well tolerated with a low rate of discomfort claims (mean 17.5%).

    "abstract": "Although the usual site of nonthrombotic venous obstruction of the upper extremity is the subclavian vein, other sites may be the cause of such obstruction. This study describes the diagnosis and treatment of six patients with partial axillary vein obstruction by the pectoralis minor muscle, a condition that can mimic subclavian vein obstruction.\nA chart review of patients undergoing pectoralis minor tenotomies (PMT) between 2004 and 2006 revealed six patients (3 men and 3 women), aged 17 to 39, who underwent seven PMT procedures for symptoms of arm swelling, cyanosis, and pain or tightness. Diagnosis was suggested by history and physical examination and was confirmed by dynamic venography. Patients with paresthesia suggesting associated neurogenic pectoralis minor compression were given a pectoralis minor muscle block. As an outpatient, PMT was initially performed with an infraclavicular approach but later through the transaxillary route. Follow-up was by phone interview in five patients and a physical examination in one.\nVenography demonstrated axillary vein compression under the pectoralis minor, which was more significant than the minor degree of subclavian vein compression seen on the same venogram. Follow-up was 1.5 years to 10 years in three patients and 3 months in the other three. All six patients experienced good-to-excellent relief of all symptoms. There were no surgical complications.\nAxillary venous obstruction by the pectoralis minor must be distinguished from subclavian vein obstruction, which presents with similar symptoms. PMT is a simple, risk-free, outpatient procedure that has produced uniformly good results.",

    "abstract": "The development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is presumed to result from multiple genetic and environmental factors, with exposure to tobacco smoke the single largest known factor predisposing to aneurysm growth. We have attempted to adapt the elastase-perfused animal model to determine whether tobacco exposure can lower the threshold of aortic injury necessary for AAA development.\nAdult C57BL/6 mice underwent transient perfusion of the infrarenal aorta with an active solution of elastase: high-dose (HDE, 0.19 U/mL, n=9), standard-dose (SDE, 0.16 U/mL, n=21) or low-dose (LDE, 0.07 U/mL, n=24). Control animals (n=24) were treated with heat inactivated elastase (HIE). Twenty LDE perfused mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (LDE-S) beginning 2 weeks before perfusion and continuing until aortic harvest. Aortic diameter (AD) was measured preperfusion, postperfusion, and at harvest on day 14. AAA was defined as %DeltaAD>or=100% between preperfusion and harvest. Aortas from each group (except HDE) were analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-12 expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.\nAll SDE mice developed large AAA by %DeltaAD (189.3%+/-16.9%, mean+/-standard error of the mean), but control mice had only a small dilatation (69.7%+/-3.7%, P<.01). Higher doses of elastase did not produce larger aneurysms in HDE mice. In contrast, only 63% of LDE mice showed aneurysmal dilatation, and these were significantly smaller (104.3%+/-4.2%, P<.01). When exposed to cigarette smoke, LDE animals developed significantly larger aneurysms (%DeltaAD, 134.5%+/-7.9%, P=.0021). There was no difference in normalized aortic MMP-9 and MMP-12 expression between elastase doses or between smoke-exposed and unexposed animals. Histologic analysis revealed that smoking increased the extent of aortic elastin degradation when compared with LDE-S animals.\nAneurysm development in the elastase model is dependent on the quantity of active elastase infused. Exposure of animals to tobacco smoke after a relatively minor aortic elastase injury produces increases in elastin degradation and aneurysm size without affecting MMP-9 or MMP-12 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in an animal model that smoking can act as a synergistic factor in AAA development. Further understanding of the relationship between smoking and AAA in this model may help unveil the pathophysiologic pathways involved between cigarette smoke and AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous access during endovascular aneurysm repair has been difficult owing to the large size of the delivery catheters. This study reports a single-center experience of totally percutaneous access during endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic repairs using the Preclose Proglide device (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, Calif).\nBetween December 2004 and August 2006, 262 endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs were performed. Percutaneous access was used for the introduction of 12F to 24F sheaths (4.4-mm to 8.6-mm outer diameter). The technique involved deployment of two Proglide devices before insertion of the sheath (\"Preclose\" technique) with the sutures left extracorporeally for closure after conclusion of the procedure. A prospectively maintained endovascular database and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Rates of technical success, failure modes, and the overall duration of the endovascular repair compared with a similar cohort using open femoral exposures were examined.\nA total of 559 Proglide devices were used to close 279 femoral arteries, and 175 (63%) required the insertion of 18F to 24F sheaths. There were 16 failures, mainly due to obesity, device malfunction, severe calcific disease, and faulty arterial punctures, for a technical success rate of 94.3%. The success rates for 12F to 16F size sheaths were significantly higher than for the larger 18F to 24F sheaths (99.0% vs 91.4%, P<.01). For both endovascular abdominal (EVAR) and thoracic (TEVAR) aortic repairs, the Preclose technique resulted in shorter overall procedure times compared with a similar cohort in which open femoral exposures were used (EVAR, 115 vs 128 min, P<.001; TEVAR, 80 vs 112, P=.019). Despite this reduction of procedure time, the savings on the cost of operating room time was negated by the cost of the Proglide devices ($295 per device).\nPercutaneous access for endovascular aortic repair is safe and feasible using the Proglide device. Although the success rates are higher for smaller size sheaths, successful closures may be obtained for up to 24F sheaths. Percutaneous access may result in shorter overall procedure times and potentially lower operating room costs, but this appears to be offset by the cost of the closure devices.",

There were 16 failures, mainly due to obesity, device malfunction, severe calcific disease, and faulty arterial punctures, for a technical success rate of 94.3%. The success rates for 12F to 16F size sheaths were significantly higher than for the larger 18F to 24F sheaths (99.0% vs 91.4%, P<.01). For both endovascular abdominal (EVAR) and thoracic (TEVAR) aortic repairs, the Preclose technique resulted in shorter overall procedure times compared with a similar cohort in which open femoral exposures were used (EVAR, 115 vs 128 min, P<.001; TEVAR, 80 vs 112, P=.019). Despite this reduction of procedure time, the savings on the cost of operating room time was negated by the cost of the Proglide devices ($295 per device).",

    "abstract": "Although muscular calf vein thrombosis (MCVT) is commonly seen in everyday practice, no treatment guidelines are available. This study evaluated short-term and mid-term outcome of isolated symptomatic MCVT.\nWe included prospectively and consecutively all patients referred to an outpatient clinic with isolated MCVT. Clinical signs were pain or edema, or both, of the calf. Diagnosis was established with duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination. Not completely occlusive and asymptomatic MCVTs were excluded. Patients were followed up clinically and with DUS at 1, 3, and 9 months, and up to 36 months. Anticoagulant therapy at curative dosage associated with compression was prescribed for 1 month and was extended for 2 additional months in case of incomplete recanalization at 1 month or if risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) were present.\nIncluded were 128 patients (78 women, 50 men) presenting with 131 MCVTs. Their mean age was 57.02 +/- 15.36 years (range, 20 to 87 years). Thrombus was present in the soleal veins (SoV) in 73 patients (55.7%) and in the medial gastrocnemius veins (MGV) in 58 (44.3%). Initial symptoms were isolated pain in the calf in 90 patients, isolated edema of the calf in six, and pain plus edema in 32. Anticoagulant therapy was prescribed in 53 patients (41.4%) for 1 month, in 59 (46.1%) for 3 months, and in 13 (10.2%) for >or=6 months. At baseline, nine pulmonary embolisms (7%), complicated with MCVT, were observed in six MGV patients (10.3%) and three SoV patients (4.1%; P = .18). Two nonfatal hemorrhagic events occurred. Three patients died during the follow-up after anticoagulant therapy had been discontinued. Recanalization of MCVT was considered complete at 1, 3, and 9 months in 54.8%, 84.7%, and 96% of cases, respectively, with no significant difference between the MGV and the SoV groups. Twenty-nine VTE symptomatic recurrences (PE, n = 6; DVT including MCVT, n = 23) were observed in 24 patients (18.8%), with similar figures in both thrombosis groups: none at 3 months, 11 between 3 and 9 months and 18 between 9 and 36 months. No extension of the MCVT or a recurrence of VTE was observed in patients treated with anticoagulant therapy. Twelve cases of superficial thrombophlebitis occurred during the follow-up period.\nThis study confirms the place of MCVT in VTE disorders. Pulmonary embolism at the MCVT initial diagnosis was not rare, and mid-term follow-up (mean, 26.7 months) revealed that 18.8% of patients had at least one VTE recurrence. The treatment of acute MCVT needs to be standardized because no guidelines currently exist.",

    "abstract": "A duplex ultrasound (DUS) surveillance algorithm used after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was applied to patients after carotid stenting and angioplasty (CAS) to determine the incidence of high-grade stent stenosis, its relationship to clinical symptoms, and the outcome of reintervention.\nIn 111 patients who underwent 114 CAS procedures for symptomatic (n = 62) or asymptomatic (n = 52) atherosclerotic or recurrent stenosis after CEA involving the internal carotid artery (ICA), DUS surveillance was performed <or=30 days and every 6 months thereafter. High-grade stenosis (peak systolic velocity [PSV] >300 cm/s, diastolic velocity >125 cm/s, internal carotid artery stent/proximal common carotid artery ratio >4) involving the stented arterial segment prompted diagnostic angiography and repair when >75% diameter-reduction stenosis was confirmed. Criteria for >50% CAS stenosis was a PSV >150 cm/s with a PSV stent ratio >2.\nAll 114 carotid stents were patent on initial DUS imaging, including 90 (79%) with PSV <150 cm/s (94 +/- 24 cm/s), 23 (20%) with PSV >150 cm/s (183 +/- 34 cm/s), and one with high-grade, residual stenosis (PSV = 355). During subsequent surveillance, 81 CAS sites (71%) exhibited no change in stenosis severity, nine sites demonstrated stenosis regression to <50% diameter reduction, and five sites developed velocity spectra of a high-grade stenosis. Angiography confirmed >75% diameter reduction in all six CASs with DUS-detected high-grade stenosis, all patients were asymptomatic, and treatment consisted of endovascular (n = 5) or surgical (n = 1) repair. During the mean 33-month follow-up period, three patients experienced ipsilateral, reversible neurologic events at 30, 45, and 120 days after CAS; none was associated with severe stent stenosis. No stent occlusions occurred, and no patient with >50% CAS stenosis on initial or subsequent testing developed a permanent ipsilateral permanent neurologic deficit or stroke-related death.\nDUS surveillance after CAS identified a 5% procedural failure rate due to the development of high-grade in-stent stenosis. Both progression and regression of stent stenosis severity was observed on serial testing, but 70% of CAS sites demonstrated velocity spectra consistent with <50% diameter reduction. The surveillance algorithm used, including reintervention for asymptomatic high-grade CAS stenosis, was associated with stent patency and the absence of disabling stroke.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality due in part to its diagnostic difficulty and operative challenges. The purpose of this study was to review our experience of surgical management in patients with this condition and to identify variables associated with adverse outcomes following surgical interventions.\nHospital records and clinical data of all patients undergoing surgical interventions for AMI were reviewed during a recent 12-year period. Clinical outcomes as well as factors influencing mortality were analyzed.\nA total of 72 patients (41 females, overall mean age 65 years, range 34 to 83 years) were included in the study. Thrombosis and embolism were the cause of AMI in 48 patients (67%) and 24 patients (33%), respectively. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom (96%), followed by nausea (56%). Preoperative angiogram was performed in 61 patients (85%). All patients underwent operative interventions, which included thromboembolectomy (n = 22, 31%), mesenteric bypass grafting (n = 33, 46%), patch angioplasty (n = 9, 12%), reimplantation (n = 5, 7%), and endarterectomy (n = 3, 4%). Bowel resection was necessary in 22 patients (31%) during the initial operation, and second-look operation was performed in 38 patients (53%). Perioperative morbidity and 30-day mortality rates were 39% and 31%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed renal insufficiency (P < .02), age >70 (P < .001), metabolic acidosis (P < .02), and symptom duration (P < .005), and bowel resection in second-look operations (P < .01) were associated with mortality. Logistic regression analysis showed age >70 (P = .03) and prolonged symptom duration (P = .02) were independent predictors of mortality.\nElderly patients and those with a prolonged duration of symptoms had worse outcomes following surgical intervention for AMI. A high index of suspicion with prompt diagnostic evaluation may reduce time delay prior to surgical intervention, which may lead to improved patient survival. Aggressive surgical intervention should be performed as promptly as possible in patients once the diagnosis of AMI is made.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective review describes the use and clinical outcome of cold perfusion protection during branch renal artery (RA) repair in 77 consecutive patients.\nFrom July 1987 through November 2006, 874 patients had open operative RA repair to 1312 kidneys. Seventy-seven patients (62 women, 15 men; mean age, 44 +/- 17 years) had branch RA reconstruction using ex vivo or in situ cold perfusion protection for 78 kidneys. Demographic data and surgical technique were examined. Blood pressure response and renal function were estimated. Patency of repair was determined by angiography and renal duplex ultrasound (RDUS) imaging. Primary RA patency was estimated by life-table methods.\nSeventy-eight RAs were repaired using ex vivo (49 kidneys) or in situ (29 kidneys) cold perfusion protection. Bilateral RA repair was performed in eight patients, with 13 repairs to solitary kidneys. RA disease included aneurysm (RAA) in 50, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in 37, atherosclerosis in 5, and arteritis in 2; 16 patients had both FMD and RAA. Hypertension was present in 93.5% (mean blood pressure, 184 +/- 35/107 +/- 19 mm Hg; mean of 1.9 +/- 1.1 drugs). RA repair included bypass using saphenous vein in 69, hypogastric artery in 3, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 2, composite vein/PTFE in 2, cephalic vein in 1, or aneurysmorrhaphy in 1. The eight bilateral RA repairs were staged. One patient required bilateral cold perfusion protection. One planned nephrectomy was performed at the time of contralateral ex vivo reconstruction. No primary nephrectomies were required for intended reconstruction. Each RA reconstruction required branch dissection and reconstruction (mean of 2.8 +/- 1.6 branches were repaired). Mean cold ischemia time was 125 +/- 40 minutes. Each kidney was reconstructed in an orthotopic fashion. Five early failures of repair required three nephrectomies and one operative revision. Based on postoperative angiography or RDUS, or both, primary patency of RA repair at 12 months was 85% +/- 5%; assisted primary patency was 93% +/- 4%. Among patients with preoperative hypertension, 15% were cured, 65% were improved, and 20% were considered failed. Early renal function was improved in 35%, unchanged in 48%, and worse in 17%. Four patients had perioperative acute tubular necrosis. No patient progressed to dialysis-dependence.\nBoth ex vivo and in situ cold perfusion protection extend the safe renal ischemia time for complex branch RA repair and avoid the need for nephrectomy.",

    "results": "Seventy-eight RAs were repaired using ex vivo (49 kidneys) or in situ (29 kidneys) cold perfusion protection. Bilateral RA repair was performed in eight patients, with 13 repairs to solitary kidneys. RA disease included aneurysm (RAA) in 50, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in 37, atherosclerosis in 5, and arteritis in 2; 16 patients had both FMD and RAA. Hypertension was present in 93.5% (mean blood pressure, 184 +/- 35/107 +/- 19 mm Hg; mean of 1.9 +/- 1.1 drugs). RA repair included bypass using saphenous vein in 69, hypogastric artery in 3, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 2, composite vein/PTFE in 2, cephalic vein in 1, or aneurysmorrhaphy in 1. The eight bilateral RA repairs were staged. One patient required bilateral cold perfusion protection. One planned nephrectomy was performed at the time of contralateral ex vivo reconstruction. No primary nephrectomies were required for intended reconstruction. Each RA reconstruction required branch dissection and reconstruction (mean of 2.8 +/- 1.6 branches were repaired). Mean cold ischemia time was 125 +/- 40 minutes. Each kidney was reconstructed in an orthotopic fashion. Five early failures of repair required three nephrectomies and one operative revision. Based on postoperative angiography or RDUS, or both, primary patency of RA repair at 12 months was 85% +/- 5%; assisted primary patency was 93% +/- 4%. Among patients with preoperative hypertension, 15% were cured, 65% were improved, and 20% were considered failed. Early renal function was improved in 35%, unchanged in 48%, and worse in 17%. Four patients had perioperative acute tubular necrosis. No patient progressed to dialysis-dependence.",

    "abstract": "In some community-based studies, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) has been shown to be independently predictive of future fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We tested the hypothesis that Lp-PLA(2) is independently predictive of mortality in high-risk patients from a vascular laboratory.\nBetween 1990 and 1994, patients seen in the previous 10 years for noninvasive lower extremity arterial testing were invited to return for a vascular examination of the lower extremities. By medical record review, we identified 2265 eligible patients; of these, 508 returned for interviews, blood collection, and arterial examination and represent those who had survived, could be located, and were willing to participate. The 508 subjects were followed up for an average of 6.7 years until the end of the study period on December 31, 2001. Vital status was ascertained by multiple searches of the Social Security Death Index. The primary outcomes for this study were time to any, CVD, and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality.\nThe mean age was 68.2 years, 88% were men, 87% were non-Hispanic white, 39.1% were diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease only, 9.2% with other CVD only, and 28.5% with both peripheral arterial disease and other CVD. During the entire follow-up period, 299 (59.7%) patients died, 167 from CVD, of which 88 deaths were due to coronary heart disease. With adjustment for CVD risk factors and baseline peripheral arterial disease and other CVD, an increment of one standard deviation in Lp-PLA(2) activity was associated with a 40% higher risk for CHD mortality at 5 years of follow-up (P = .04). Additional adjustment for triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduced this association to nonsignificance (hazard risk, 1.12).\nIn a vascular laboratory patient population, higher levels of LpPLA(2) mass and activity were not significantly associated with total, CVD, or CHD mortality at 5 years of follow-up and after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors and the presence of PAD and other CVD at baseline. An apparent elevated risk of CHD death associated with elevated Lp-PLA2 was largely explained by associated elevations in lipids and lipoproteins.",

The purpose of this study is to review the spectrum, management, and clinical outcome of patients with vascular abnormalities and NF-I.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 31 patients (15 males, 16 females) with clinical NF-I and vascular abnormalities identified from imaging or operative findings between 1976 and 2005.\nThe diagnosis of NF-I was made at a mean age of 11 +/- 10 years with vascular lesions identified at a mean age of 38 +/- 16 years. There were 76 vascular abnormalities, including 38 aneurysms, 20 arterial stenoses, 5 arteriovenous malformations (AVM), 5 arteries compressed or invaded by neural tumors, and 6 abnormalities of the heart valves. Arterial lesions were located in the aorta (n = 17) and in the renal (n = 12), mesenteric (n = 12), carotid-vertebral (n = 10), intracerebral (n = 4), and subclavian-axillary and iliofemoral arteries (3 each). Interventions were required in 23 patients (74%); 15 underwent 24 arterial reconstructions, including 9 renal, 8 aortic, 4 mesenteric, 2 carotid, and 1 femoral. The other eight patients had excision of AVM in three, vessel ligation in two, and clipping of cerebral aneurysms, coil embolization of hepatic aneurysms, and left thoracotomy in one patient each. One patient died of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Six patients (26%) had postoperative complications, including pneumonia in two, and stroke, acalculous cholecystitis, brachial plexopathy and chylothorax in one patient each. The median follow up was 4.1 years (range, 6 months to 20 years). Late vascular problems developed in three patients, including graft stenoses in two and rupture of another aortic aneurysm in one. Freedom from graft-related complications was 83% at 10 years. Patient survival at 10 years was 77%, less than the 86% expected survival for the general population (P < .001).\nPatients with NF-I have a wide spectrum of vascular abnormalities, most notably aneurysms or stenoses of the aortic, renal, and mesenteric circulation. Operative treatment of symptomatic patients with vascular lesions or large aneurysms is safe, effective, and durable.",

    "abstract": "To describe a novel technique for maximal reimplantation of intercostal arteries during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nEight patients underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair with this new technique from 2005 to 2006. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 14 months. All patients had a previous type B dissection with subsequent aneurysmal degeneration into an extent I TAAA. Aneurysm repair was performed through a thoracoabdominal incision and circulatory arrest in seven and left atrial-left femoral (LA-FA) bypass in one. The grafts extended from the distal arch at the subclavian artery to the visceral and renal arteries. An 8 mm graft was then extended from the proximal to the distal graft with a spatulation of the graft allowing a side-to-side anastomosis of the graft to the posterior aortic wall incorporating multiple pairs of intercostal arteries. Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were monitored during each operation.\nAll patients were ambulatory at the time of admission. One patient had suffered a previous spinal cord infarction from the original dissection and had residual unilateral leg weakness prior to the TAAA repair. There was an average of seven pairs of patent intercostal arteries upon opening the aorta. We reimplanted an average of five pairs of vessels. There were no perioperative complications. No patients sustained transient or permanent paraplegia in the postoperative or follow-up period. The one patient with preoperative leg weakness had reported subjective increased strength in the affected leg after the operation. In four cases, normalization of SSEP waveforms did not occur until after reimplantation of the intercostal arteries despite full return of EEG waveforms, restoration of lower extremity perfusion, and rewarming of the patient. Follow-up CT scan angiogram demonstrated that all reconstructions were patent through the follow-up period.\nParaplegia is an extremely morbid complication associated with TAAA repair. We describe a technique that allows reimplantation of almost all intercostal arteries as one patch circumventing the need for selective reimplantation. Furthermore, our technique ensures continued patency of this patch graft as the outflow resistance is decreased by creating a continuous flow loop. Although this is a small case series, we had no incidence of acute or delayed paraplegia in this high risk group. Our technique of intercostal reimplantation is applicable to all open TAAA repair at high-risk for paraplegia and may be an important adjunct in preventing spinal cord ischemia.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effectiveness of perioperative strategies to prevent infection in patients undergoing peripheral arterial reconstruction.\nAll randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating measures intended to reduce or prevent infection in arterial surgery were identified through searches of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group specialized trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and reference lists of relevant articles. Two authors independently selected and assessed the quality of included trials. Relative risk (RR) was used as a measure of effect for each dichotomous outcome.\nThe study included 34 RCTs. Of these, 22 were trials of prophylactic systemic antibiotics, 3 of rifampicin-bonded grafts, 3 of preoperative skin antisepsis, 2 of suction wound drainage, 2 of minimally invasive in situ bypass techniques, and individual trials of intraoperative glove change and wound closure techniques. Wound infection or early graft infection outcomes were recorded in all trials. Only two trials, both of rifampicin bonding, followed up graft infection outcomes to 2 years. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics reduced the risk of wound infection (RR, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 0.38) and early graft infection in a fixed-effect model (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.85, P = .02). Antibiotic prophylaxis for >24 hours appeared to be of no added benefit (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.98). There was no evidence that prophylactic rifampicin bonding to Dacron grafts reduced graft infection at 1 month (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.49), or 2 years (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.46 to 2.40). There was no evidence of a beneficial or detrimental effect on rates of wound infection with suction groin wound drainage (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.86) or from preoperative bathing with antiseptic agents compared with unmedicated bathing (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.36).\nThere is clear evidence of the benefit of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics for vascular reconstruction. Many other interventions intended to reduce the risk of infection in arterial reconstruction lack evidence of effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Venous obliteration using foam sclerosant is a relatively new procedure that holds great promise and may prove to be as effective as conventional surgical treatments in obliteration of the great saphenous vein. Foam sclerotherapy can have minor and major complications, most of which occur as a result of gas or sclerosant leakage into the systemic venous system. Conventionally, the saphenofemoral junction is occluded by digital pressure to prevent escape of sclerosant foam into the deep venous system. We propose balloon control of the saphenofemoral junction to prevent sclerosant leakage. This also promotes foam contact with the endothelium in a prolonged, controlled fashion. This method requires no anesthesia, is suitable for ambulatory care, and has been safe and successful in all five cases. Duplex examinations at 1 week and 3 months have shown complete obliteration of the great saphenous vein using this technique.",

Successful recanalization was achieved without adverse anatomic or neurologic sequelae. The patient remains asymptomatic with a radiographically patent reconstruction at 1 year. This combination of endovascular and open surgery enables the surgeon to address long occlusions of the common carotid arteries with control of the distal and proximal endarterectomy margins and obviates the need for general anesthesia or sternotomy.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) enlarges after successful endovascular repair because of endoleak, which is persistent blood flow within the aneurysm sac. In the absence of detectable endoleak, AAA may still expand, in part because of endotension, which is persistent pressurization within the excluded aneurysm. We report three patients who underwent successful endovascular AAA repair using the Excluder device (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz). Although their postoperative surveillance showed an initial aneurysm regression, delayed aneurysm enlargement developed in all three, apparently due to endotension. Endovascular treatment was performed in which endograft reinforcement with a combination of aortic cuff and iliac endograft extenders were inserted in the previously implanted stent grafts. The endograft reinforcement procedure successfully resulted in aneurysm sac regression in all three patients. Our study underscores the significance of increased graft permeability as a mechanism of endotension and delayed aneurysm enlargement after successful endovascular AAA repair. In addition, our cases illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of an endovascular treatment strategy when endotension and aneurysm sac enlargement develops after endovascular AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonist celiprolol has been widely used as an effective antihypertensive agent. Some studies reported that celiprolol enhances nitric oxide production. The purpose of the present study is to examine the effects of celiprolol on vein graft intimal hyperplasia and endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation.\nJapanese white rabbits were randomized to a control group that was fed regular rabbit chow or to a celiprolol group that was fed regular rabbit chow supplemented with 100 mg/body celiprolol sodium. The reversed jugular vein was implanted into the carotid artery. At 2 and 4 weeks after the operation, vein grafts in both groups were harvested, and intimal hyperplasia of the vein grafts was assessed. At 4 weeks after the operation, harvested vein grafts from both the groups were examined on the endothelium-dependent relaxation by application of Ach and were examined to detect for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression and superoxide anion production.\nCeliprolol inhibited intimal hyperplasia of carotid interposition-reversed jugular vein grafts 4 weeks after implantation (Intima/media index of celiprolol group, 0.48 +/- 0.01 vs control group, 1.07 +/- 0.08, P < .05) and suppressed cell proliferation in the neointima 2 weeks after implantation. In addition, celiprolol significantly enhanced endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation in the vein graft with no change in eNOS expression and a reduction in superoxide production.\nThese novel findings clearly demonstrate that beta-adrenoceptor antagonist celiprolol can suppress intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft, which may be due to the enhancement of nitric oxide function through an inhibition of superoxide production. These results strongly support the clinical usefulness of celiprolol administration for preventing intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft after bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell proliferation (SMC) is a pivotal factor in the development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. A number of growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), have been shown to be involved in SMC proliferation. We evaluated the effect of picropodophyllin (PPP), a new IGF-1 receptor inhibitor, in the prevention of SMC proliferation and development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury.\nThe effects of systemic administration of PPP on intimal hyperplasia were studied in a balloon rat carotid injury model. Lesions were quantified by morphometry and SMC proliferation and apoptosis was studied by immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and activated caspase 3, respectively. The effect of PPP on rat aortic SMC proliferation and apoptosis was studied in vitro by using cell counting, 3[H]-thymidine incorporation, and a flow cytometry assay for annexin V. Phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor, protein kinase B (Akt), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by using Western blotting.\nPPP inhibited IGF-1-mediated SMC proliferation in vitro but no significant increase in apoptosis was detected. In rats treated with PPP, a more than a twofold reduction in carotid intima area was observed 2 weeks after balloon injury, a significant decrease in PCNA staining was demonstrated in early lesions, but activated caspase 3 was not detected. In addition, PPP attenuated phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor, Akt, and ERK1/2 in IGF-1-stimulated SMCs in vitro, and a reduced phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor and Akt was found in balloon-injured carotid arteries in rats treated with PPP.\nThese results show that PPP potently blocks IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor in SMCs, decreases downstream Akt and ERK1/2 activation, inhibits SMC replication, and subsequently attenuates intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury of rat carotid arteries.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of variables associated with vascular surgical site infections (VSSI) often contribute adversely to reinfection, limb salvage, and mortality rates. This report details our experience with the selective use of a sartorius muscle flaps (SMF) as part of an overall treatment strategy focused on staged surgical debridement (SSD) to control prosthetic graft bed infection prior to a graft preservation or revision plan.\nFrom our vascular registry, we identified 422 VSSI of which 89 (21%) had SMF for 24 aorto-bifemoral (ABF), 19 extra-anatomic bypasses (EAB), 34 infrainguinal bypasses, and 12 combined inflow/outflow reconstructions. All 86 patients had Szilagyi grade III prosthetic (Dacron-36, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]-50) graft infections. The treatment algorithm included: SSD, culture-directed parenteral antibiotics, graft preservation (n = 3), or reconstruction (graft excision/EAB, n = 4; rifampin-bonded PTFE, n = 22; autologous conduit, n = 57) based on microbiology and consideration for SMF for extensive soft tissue defects (n = 43) or non-sterilized graft beds (n = 40). Analysis of microbiology, recurrent infection, vascular reconstruction, limb salvage, and mortality was completed over a mean follow-up of 52 months (range: 12 to 132 months).\nThirty-day mortality was 2% with two aortic graft infections dying from sepsis. Survival by life table analysis at 1, 3, and 5 years was 94%, 92%, and 90%, respectively. Wound isolates were most commonly gram positive organisms (n = 58, 65%), with gram negative isolates and mixed infections accounting for 19% and 10%, respectively. A single recurrent groin infection was documented at 30 days. Freedom from recurrent infection (n = 6) at 1 and 5 years was 98% and 92% by life tables. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was involved for 50% of reinfections. No amputations were attributable to uncontrolled VSSI and graft patency was 100% in surveillance monitored patients.\nThese results suggest that selective utilization of SMF as part of SSD treatment plan in an attempt to achieve graft bed sterilization can effectively control the complex infectious process allowing for potentially improved outcomes for in situ or preservation graft salvage techniques. Lifelong graft surveillance is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Atheroembolization during renal artery angioplasty and stenting (RA-PTAS) has been postulated as a cause for the inferior renal function results observed when compared with those with surgical revascularization. To further characterize procedure-associated atheroembolism, we analyzed recovered atheroembolic debris and clinical data from patients undergoing RA-PTAS with distal embolic protection (DEP).\nRA-PTAS procedures were performed with DEP using a commercially available temporary balloon occlusion and aspiration catheter system between July 2005 and December 2006. Following RA-PTAS but prior to deflation of the distal occlusion balloon, the static column of blood proximal to the balloon was aspirated and submitted for embolic particle analysis. Angiograms, demographics, and laboratory data were reviewed. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated before RA-PTAS and at 4 to 8 weeks postintervention using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Associations between clinical factors, captured particle counts, and changes in renal function were examined using univariate techniques and multiple linear regression.\nTwenty-eight RA-PTAS procedures were performed with DEP. Mean total number of embolic particles counted per procedure was 2033 +/- 1553 for particles 20-60 microm and 265 +/- 132 for particles >60 microm. Significant positive associations with quantity of captured particles 20 to 60 microm were observed for African American race (P = .002), predilation (P = .005), and stent diameter (P < .001); a significant negative association was observed for preoperative aspirin use (P =.016). Quantity of captured particles >60 microm was positively associated with ratio of stent to renal artery diameter (P =.009). Change in eGFR was positively associated with preoperative aspirin use (P = .006) and preoperative eGFR (P < .001), while a negative association was observed for captured particle counts >60 microm (P = .015).\nThese results demonstrate the liberation of thousands of atheroembolic particles during RA-PTAS. Clinical, anatomic, and device-related factors may be predictive of procedural embolization, and increasing captured particle counts >60 microm were associated with inferior renal function results. Further investigation is warranted to establish relationships between atheroembolism, end organ functional impairment, and clinical responses.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with cerebral embolic protection is a safe alternative to carotid endarterectomy in high-risk patients. Among the various systems proposed for cerebral protection, transcervical CAS avoids crossing the lesion without protection and eliminates the complications associated with transfemoral access. This study analyzes our experience and the results obtained with a transcervical stenting technique for carotid revascularization.\nFrom January 2005 to June 2006, 62 CAS were performed in our center in high-risk patients with >70% stenosis (38.7% had a previous neurologic event and 61.3% were asymptomatic). The indications for CAS were severe heart disease (45.1%), severe pulmonary disease (6.4%), paralysis of the contralateral laryngeal nerve (6.4%), recurrent stenosis (3.2%), and high carotid lesion (1.6%). Twenty-one patients were >80 years old. A complete neurologic examination was performed by a stroke neurologist in all patients before and after stenting. The protection system used was carotid flow reversal by transcervical access. Transcranial Doppler monitoring was done during the procedure in 35 patients. We analyzed technical success, the presence of high-intensity transient signals during the procedure, neurologic morbidity and mortality at 30 days and 6 months, and stent patency at 6 months (range, 1 to 18 months). Technical success was 96.8%. Perioperative high-intensity transient signals were observed in two patients (5.7%). In the immediate postoperative period, one patient had a transient ischemic attack of the anterior cerebral artery and another had a stroke, with contralateral hemiplegia. At 48 hours after discharge, a third patient returned to the hospital with a severe cerebral hemorrhage that required surgical drainage; hence, neurologic morbidity was 4.9%. There were no deaths at 6 months. Among the total, 98.4% of the stents remained patent, two showed restenosis of 50% to 70%, and one restenosis of >70%. No patients presented a neurologic event during the follow-up.\nTranscervical carotid artery stenting with flow reversal cerebral protection is a relatively simple, safe technique that avoids instrumentation of the aortic arch and crossing the target lesion without protection. It is less expensive than techniques requiring a filter device and provides excellent outcome with an acceptable incidence of complications.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), previously reported to occur in 1%/year after operation, is the finite limitation of CEA. Eversion endarterectomy has a perceived lower incidence of recurrent stenosis, although data to support this contention are conflicting. The goal of the present study was to compare the late anatomic results of patch closure (PC) vs eversion CEA.\nBetween January 1, 1995 and June 30, 2005, 950 CEA were performed by the senior author with adoption of eversion (EV) as the primary technique as of January 1, 2001. With minimum of 1-year follow-up by study inclusion criteria, complete follow-up data (including a duplex scan) was available for 155 PC and 135 EV patients. Incidence of moderate (50% to 70%) and severe (>70%) restenosis was examined at < or =2 months and >1 year after operation. Study end-points included late stroke, survival, and freedom from restenosis (moderate and severe) and were assessed by actuarial methods.\nThere were no differences in relevant demographic/clinical parameters, indication for surgery (69% overall asymptomatic) or early perioperative stroke/death (1.1% overall; P = .25) between PC and EV. After correction for different mean follow-up intervals (PC = 5.5 years vs EV = 3.5 years) by actuarial methods, there was no significant difference in late moderate (P = .91) or severe (P = .54) recurrent stenosis between PC and EV. In the group of patients with at least 1-year follow-up, 11/290 (3.8%) patients (4/135 EV, 7/155 PC; P = .39) required reintervention on their operated carotid artery at a cumulative follow-up interval of 4.5 years. Three strokes (3/290; 1.1%) occurred during late follow-up, all in the PC group, with only one related to the operated carotid artery. Late survival was similar between EV and PC, (P = .86). Female gender (odds ratio [OR] 3.72[1.02-13.5], P = .046) was associated with severe restenosis irrespective of surgical technique. Univariate analysis also showed that female gender (OR 7.6[CI: 0.88-66.7], P = .042) was associated with late stroke.\nThese findings indicate that restenosis rates are similar between eversion and patch CEA and likely represent biological remodeling phenomenon rather than technical variations of operations. While EV offers distinct advantages in certain anatomic circumstances, adoption of EV with the hope of decreasing restenosis is not warranted.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to compare the early and mid-term results of the medial and posterior approaches in the surgical treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs).\nFrom 1992 to 2006 in three hospitals, 110 popliteal aneurysms needed surgical repair by a posterior or a medial approach. Of 36 aneurysms repaired by the posterior approach, 33 could be case-matched to a medially excluded PAA according to the criteria of (1) patient age, (2) cardiovascular comorbidity, (3) indication for PAA repair, (4) diameter of PAA at time of surgical repair, (5) number of distal outflow vessels at time of surgical repair, and (6) type of bypass or interposition graft (venous or polytetrafluoroethylene).\nDuring the 30-day postoperative period, seven complications (21%) occurred in each group, no patients died, and no amputations were necessary. Two patients in the posterior group vs none in the medial group (P < .05) needed thrombectomy because of occlusion of the reconstruction. The mean follow-up was 47 months (range, 2 to 176). In this period, 13 deaths occurred, but none were related to the previous interventions. The primary patency rates at 6 months and at 1, 3, and 4 years were 84%, 79%, 66%, and 66% in the posterior group and 96% (P < .05), 93% (P < .05), 76% (P = NS), and 69 % (P = NS) for the medial group, respectively. The secondary patency rates at 6 months, and at 1, 3, and 4 years were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 90% in the posterior group and 96%, 96%, 96%, and 90% in the medial group, respectively (P = NS). Limb salvage rates were 97% for the posterior group and 100% for the medial group (P = NS). No neurologic complications or venous damage was seen in either group. Irrespective of approach, venous reconstructions resulted in significantly higher patency rates compared with prosthetic reconstructions at the 3-year follow-up (84% vs 67%, P < .01). During follow-up, which included duplex scanning, two patients in the medial group needed renewed surgical intervention and posterior exclusion because of persistent flow and growth of the native aneurysm.\nEarly (<1 year) primary patency rates of the medial approach were significantly better than the posterior approach, possibly because of the limited posterior exposure. However, in the absence of a significant difference in long-term primary and secondary patency rates between the posterior and medial approach, and considering the substantial risk of aneurysm growth after medial approach (up to 22%), the posterior approach might be the surgical method of preference for PAA repair in the long run.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with an excessive risk for cardiovascular events and mortality. To determine measures prognostic of adverse events, ankle-brachial index (ABI) was compared with dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in patients referred to our vascular center for the evaluation of PAD.\nThe medical records of consecutive patients referred for the concurrent evaluation of PAD and coronary artery disease (CAD) between 1992 and 1995 were reviewed for subsequent cardiovascular events and death.\nAmong 395 patients (mean age, 69.7 +/- 9.6 years; 40% women), 341 had abnormal ABI and 268 had abnormal DSE (95 fixed and 173 stress-induced wall motion abnormalities). During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, 27.3% of patients experienced a cardiovascular event, and 39.4% died. By multivariate analysis, ABI provided the strongest prediction of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36 to 4.05; P = .002). Conversely, DSE with inducible or fixed wall motion abnormalities showed no association with cardiovascular events or increased mortality in multivariate analysis. The only DSE variable independently predictive of mortality was decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%) at peak stress (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.36; P = .002). Statin and aspirin therapy, but not beta-blockers, were protective. There was no relation between ABI and wall motion index score at rest or after stress.\nIn high-risk patients referred to our vascular center for the evaluation of PAD, the assessment of ABI provided a strong independent prediction of all-cause mortality. Therefore, proper interpretation of this simple, affordable, and reproducible measure extends beyond the assessment of PAD severity. Although a poor left ventricular response to dobutamine was also predictive, other echo variables were not.",

Intraplaque hemorrhage is found in unstable plaques and is detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to ascertain whether intraplaque hemorrhage as seen on carotid MRI predicts particulate embolization in the dissection phase of CEA.\nPatients with high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing CEA were prospectively enrolled. All underwent preoperative MRI assessment of the carotid arteries for intraplaque hemorrhage and transcranial Doppler scanning during the dissection phase of the CEA to assess the presence of microembolic signals. Associations between intraplaque hemorrhage and intraoperative microembolic signals were studied.\nAnalysis was undertaken on 60 participants; of these, 36 (60%) showed ipsilateral carotid MRI intraplaque hemorrhage, and 24 (40%) did not. Microembolic signals were detected during the dissection phase in 23 (38.3%) participants, and 19 had MRI-detected intraplaque hemorrhage. The association between carotid intraplaque hemorrhage and the presence of dissection phase microembolic signals was significant (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 19.7, P = .007), even after controlling for age, sex, individual surgeon, degree of stenosis, and delay from symptom to CEA (adjusted OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 30.4, P = .037).\nIntraplaque hemorrhage as detected by carotid MRI predicts particulate embolization during the dissection phase of CEA. This imaging technique can be used to identify patients with increased intraoperative thromboembolic risk, and this could influence preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences.\nThis prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic.\nAll patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without.\nLocal anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Although autogenous brachial-basilic upper arm transpositions (BVT) have been extensively utilized, there has been significant disparity in published patency rates. Very little is known about the efficacy of autogenous brachial-cephalic upper arm transpositions (CVT). We evaluated our experience with transposed upper arm arteriovenous fistulas (tAVF) in order to assess patency and identify factors that affect efficacy. We then compared our tAVF patients with a cohort of upper arm arteriovenous grafts (AVG).\nA retrospective review was conducted of tAVF performed at our institution from 1998 to 2004. The tAVF group consisted of 119 BVT and 71 CVT procedures. We compared these with 164 AVG. tAVF were placed only for veins >/=2.5 mm in diameter by duplex ultrasonography.\nMean follow-up was 28 months. With the exception of mean vein diameter, the patients in the BVT and CVT groups had similar demographic parameters and complication rates. Primary and secondary patency rates were 52% and 62% at 5 years for BVT and 40% and 46% at 5 years for CVT, respectively (P = NS). Multivariate analysis revealed that hemodialysis dependence at the time of fistula placement and history of previous upper arm access independently affected primary patency. History of upper torso dialysis catheters independently affected secondary patency. Comparison of the tAVF and AVG groups revealed that tAVF patients were significantly younger, more likely to be male, less likely to be African American (AA) and less likely to have a history of previous AV access. The primary patency rate for tAVF was significantly higher than for AVG: 48% vs 14% at 5 years (P < .001). The secondary patency rate for tAVF was also significantly higher than for AVG: 57% vs 17% at 5 years (P < .001). Among the tAVF procedures, 9% required one or more revisions to maintain secondary patency, compared to 51% with the AVG group (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that presence of AVG and a history of previous upper arm access negatively affected primary and secondary patency.\nAutogenous BVT and CVT have similar, high patency rates. Transposed upper arm arteriovenous fistulas have higher patency rates than upper arm AVG and require significantly fewer revisions. Our data strongly support the contention that as long as the patient is a candidate for an upper arm tAVF, based on anatomical criteria, a tAVF should always be considered before an AVG.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 endoleak occurs in up to 20% of patients after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), but its long-term significance is debated. We reviewed our experience to evaluate late outcomes associated with type 2 endoleak.\nDuring the interval January 1994 to December 2005, 873 patients underwent EVAR. Computed tomography (CT) scan assessment was performed < or =1 month of the operation and at least annually thereafter. Sequential 6-month CT scan follow-up was adopted for those patients with persistent type 2 endoleaks, and reintervention was limited to those with sac enlargement >5 mm. Study end points included overall survival, aneurysm sac growth, reintervention rate, conversion to open repair, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture. Preoperative variables and anatomic factors potentially associated with these endpoints were assessed using multivariate analysis.\nWe identified 164 (18.9%) patients with early (at the first follow-up CT scan) type 2 endoleaks. Mean follow-up was 32.6 months. In 131 (79.9%) early type 2 endoleaks, complete and permanent leak resolution occurred < or =6 months. Endoleaks persisted in 33 patients (3.8% of total patients; 20.1% of early type 2 endoleaks) for >6 months. Transient type 2 endoleak (those that resolved < or =6 months of EVAR) was not associated with adverse late outcomes. In contrast, persistent endoleak was associated with several adverse outcomes. AAA-related death was not significantly different between patients with and without a type 2 endoleak (P = .78). When evaluating patients with no early endoleak vs persistent endoleak, freedom from sac expansion at 1, 3, and 5 years was 99.2%, 97.6%, and 94.9% (no leak) vs 88.1%, 48.0%, and 28.0% (persistent) (P < .001). Patients with persistent endoleak were at increased risk for aneurysm sac growth vs patients without endoleak (odds ratio [OR], 25.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.8 to 57.4; P < .001). Patients with a persistent endoleak also had a significantly increased rate of reintervention (OR, 19.0; 95% CI, 8.0 to 44.7); P < .001). Finally, aneurysm rupture occurred in 4 patients with type 2 endoleaks. Freedom from rupture at 1, 3, and 5 years for patients with a persistent type 2 endoleak was 96.8%, 96.8%, and 91.1% vs 99.8%, 98.5%, and 97.4% for patients without a type 2 endoleak. Multivariate analysis demonstrated persistent type 2 endoleak to be a significant predictor of aneurysm rupture (P = .03).\nPersistent type 2 endoleak is associated with an increased incidence of adverse outcomes, including aneurysm sac growth, the need for conversion to open repair, reintervention rate, and rupture. These data suggest that patients with persistent type 2 endoleak (>6 months) should be considered for more frequent follow-up or a more aggressive approach to reintervention.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the initial hospital cost associated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is approximately $20,000. However, the cost of long-term surveillance and secondary procedures is poorly characterized.\nBetween December 1998 and June 2006, 259 patients underwent EVAR for infrarenal aneurysms at a single institution. Follow-up costs were calculated using a relative value unit based hospital cost accounting system, which incorporates departmental direct and indirect costs. Institutional overhead costs were included using a conversion factor. Costs for professional services were determined by a cost-to-charge ratio, and outpatient visits were calculated with a time-based formula. Year 2006 costs were applied to prior years. To minimize costs associated with the early learning curve, the initial 50 EVAR patients between December 1995 and 1998 were excluded. Patients with <1 year follow-up were also excluded. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard error.\nThe mean follow-up after EVAR for 136 patients was 34.7 +/- 1.8 months. The cumulative 5-year postplacement cost per patient was $11,351. The 27 patients (19.9%) who required secondary procedures had a 5-year cumulative cost of $31,696 compared with $3668 for 109 patients without secondary procedures (8.6-fold increase, P < .05). The 5-year cost for patients with endoleak was $26,739 compared with $5706 for those without endoleak (4.7-fold increase, P < .05). Overall, major cost components were 57.4% for secondary procedures and 32.5% for radiologic studies.\nDuring a 5-year period, the postplacement cost of EVAR increases the global cost by 44%. The subgroups of patients with endoleaks and those requiring secondary procedures generate a disproportionate share of postplacement costs. Efforts at minimizing cost should emphasize technical and device modifications aimed at reducing endoleaks and the need for secondary procedures.",

    "abstract": "To determine criteria for a clinically significant vein stenosis with duplex ultrasound (DU) in patients with signs and symptoms of central venous outflow obstruction.\nPatients referred with swelling with or without pain to the vascular laboratory to detect vein obstruction were evaluated. These were mostly patients who had liver transplant, dialysis access, and tumors. All patients had DU prior to any other imaging. Only patients who subsequently underwent phlebography with intention to treat the vein stenosis were included in the study. A phlebogram with two views, pressure measurements across the stenosis, and intravascular ultrasound in selected cases were performed in all patients with suspected stenosis on DU. Adjacent ipsilateral normal vein segments were utilized as controls. The invasive tests were performed within 2 weeks of the DU. Follow-up was performed with DU at discharge and within 6 months of the procedure. A pressure gradient of =3 mm Hg across the stenosis was used to define a >50% diameter reduction, which was also determined by phlebographic measurement.\nThirty-seven patients, 20 males and 17 females, mean age 54 years, range 27 to 79, were evaluated. Forty-one stenotic venous sites were detected with DU; inferior vena cava 14, superior vena cava 2, portal 2, iliac 11, common femoral 3, brachiocephalic 3, subclavian 5, and axillary vein 1. Phlebography identified 37 of these stenoses and demonstrated two more not seen by DU. Pressure measurements confirmed 39 of those detected by DU. The best criterion by DU to detect a >50% stenosis was a poststenotic to pre-stenotic peak vein velocity ratio of 2.5. The presence of poststenotic turbulence and planimetric calculations of the diameter reduction increased the diagnostic confidence but not the accuracy. Using the pressure gradient of >/=3 mm Hg as a reference test, there were two false positive and two false negative exams with DU, while phlebography had two false negative exams. The overall agreement of DU alone was 90% of phlebography >95% and when combined 100%. Intravascular ultrasound identified correctly all 11 lesions in 11 patients. After angioplasty and stenting, there was a dramatic reduction in the edema in most patients particularly in those that had a caval stenosis. Restenosis was identified by DU in 5/29 (17%) patients at 6 months that were confirmed by phlebography and pressure measurements. Reintervention was performed in four and it was successful in three.\nDU is a sensitive method to identify a clinically significant vein stenosis. A peak vein velocity ratio of >2.5 across the stenosis is the best criterion to use for the presence of a pressure gradient of =3 mm Hg. DU can be used to select patients for intervention and also to monitor the success of the treatment during follow-up.",

    "results": "Thirty-seven patients, 20 males and 17 females, mean age 54 years, range 27 to 79, were evaluated. Forty-one stenotic venous sites were detected with DU; inferior vena cava 14, superior vena cava 2, portal 2, iliac 11, common femoral 3, brachiocephalic 3, subclavian 5, and axillary vein 1. Phlebography identified 37 of these stenoses and demonstrated two more not seen by DU. Pressure measurements confirmed 39 of those detected by DU. The best criterion by DU to detect a >50% stenosis was a poststenotic to pre-stenotic peak vein velocity ratio of 2.5. The presence of poststenotic turbulence and planimetric calculations of the diameter reduction increased the diagnostic confidence but not the accuracy. Using the pressure gradient of >/=3 mm Hg as a reference test, there were two false positive and two false negative exams with DU, while phlebography had two false negative exams. The overall agreement of DU alone was 90% of phlebography >95% and when combined 100%. Intravascular ultrasound identified correctly all 11 lesions in 11 patients. After angioplasty and stenting, there was a dramatic reduction in the edema in most patients particularly in those that had a caval stenosis. Restenosis was identified by DU in 5/29 (17%) patients at 6 months that were confirmed by phlebography and pressure measurements. Reintervention was performed in four and it was successful in three.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the exercise performance of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who have different types of exertional leg pain.\nPatients with PAD were classified into one of four groups according to the San Diego Claudication Questionnaire: intermittent claudication (n = 406), atypical exertional leg pain causing patients to stop (n = 125), atypical exertional leg pain in which patients were able to continue walking (n = 81), and leg pain on exertion and rest (n = 103). Patients were assessed on the primary outcome measures of ankle-brachial index (ABI), treadmill exercise measures, and ischemic window.\nAll patients experienced leg pain consistent with intermittent claudication during a standardized treadmill test. The mean (+/- SD) initial claudication distance (ICD) was similar (P = .642) among patients with intermittent claudication (168 +/- 160 meters), atypical exertional leg pain causing patients to stop (157 +/- 130 meters), atypical exertional leg pain in which patients were able to continue walking (180 +/- 149 meters), and leg pain on exertion and rest (151 +/- 136 meters). The absolute claudication distance (ACD) was similar (P = .648) in the four respective groups (382 +/- 232, 378 +/- 237, 400 +/- 245, and 369 +/- 236 meters). Similarly, the ischemic window, expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) after treadmill exercise, was similar (P = .863) in these groups (189 +/- 137, 208 +/- 183, 193 +/- 143, and 199 +/- 119 AUC).\nPAD patients with different types of exertional leg pain, all limited by intermittent claudication during a standardized treadmill test, were remarkably similar in ICD, ACD, and ischemic window. Thus, the presence of ambulatory symptoms should be of primary clinical concern in evaluating PAD patients regardless of whether they are consistent with classic intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "This cross-sectional study was set in an academic medical center and conducted to identify associations of physical activity level and walking exercise frequency with calf skeletal muscle characteristics in individuals with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nCalf muscle characteristics in 439 men and women with PAD were measured with computed tomography at 66.67% of the distance between the distal and proximal tibia. Physical activity was measured continuously during 7 days with a vertical accelerometer. Patient report was used to determine the number of blocks walked during the past week and walking exercise frequency. Results were adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidities, ankle-brachial index, body mass index, smoking, and other confounders.\nFor both objective and subjective measures, more physically active PAD participants had higher calf muscle area and muscle density. Calf muscle area across tertiles of accelerometer-measured physical activity were first activity tertile, 5071 mm(2); second activity tertile: 5612 mm(2); and third activity tertile, 5869 mm(2) (P < .001). Calf muscle density across tertiles of patient-reported blocks walked during the past week were first activity tertile, 31.4 mg/cm(3); second activity tertile, 33.0 mg/cm(3); and third activity tertile, 33.8 mg/cm(3) (P < .001). No significant associations were found between walking exercise frequency and calf muscle characteristics.\nAmong participants with PAD, higher physical activity levels, measured by accelerometer and by patient-reported blocks walked per week, were associated with more favorable calf muscle characteristics. In contrast, more frequent patient-reported walking exercise was not associated with more or less favorable calf muscle characteristics. Results suggest that clinicians should encourage their patients to increase their walking activity during daily life.",

    "abstract": "Decision making for peripheral vascular disease can be quite complex as a result of pre-existing compromise of patient functional status, anatomic considerations, uncertainty of favorable outcome, medical comorbidities, and limitations in life expectancy. The ability of prospective decision-analysis models to predict individual quality of life in patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease was tested.\nThis was a prospective cohort study. The settings were university and Veterans Administration vascular surgery practices. All 214 patients referred with symptomatic lower extremity arterial disease of any severity over a 2-year period were screened, and 206 were enrolled. A Markov model was compared with standard clinical decision-making. Utility assessment and generalized (Short Form-36; SF-36) and disease-specific (Walking Impairment Questionnaire; WIQ) quality of life were derived before treatment. Estimates of treatment outcome probabilities and intended and actual treatment plans were provided by attending vascular surgeons. The main outcome measures were generalized (SF-36) and disease-specific (WIQ) variables at study entry and at 4 and 12 months.\nPrimary intervention consisted of amputation for 9, bypass for 42, angioplasty for 8, and medical treatment for 147 patients. Considering all patients, no improvement in mean overall patient quality of life measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Score (27 +/- 8 vs 28 +/- 8; P = .87) or WIQ (39 +/- 22 vs 39 +/- 23; P = .13) was noted 12 months after counseling and treatment by the vascular surgeons. Individually considered SF-36 categories were improved only for Bodily Pain (40 +/- 23 vs 49 +/- 25; P = .03), with the most significant improvement observed among patients with the most severe pain (68 +/- 25 vs 37 +/- 23; P = .02) and among those undergoing bypass (60 +/- 29 vs 31 +/- 22; P = .02). It is noteworthy that when the treatment chosen was incongruent with the Markov model, patients were more likely to report a poorer quality of life at 1 year (Physical Component Score, 25 +/- 8 vs 29 +/- 8; P < .001). The quality of life predicted at baseline by the Markov model correlated positively with the Physical Component Score (r = 0.23), Bodily Pain (r = 0.33), and Fatigue (r = 0.44) and negatively with WIQ (r = -0.08) observed 1 year later.\nProspective application of an individualized decision Markov model in patients with vascular disease was predictive of patient quality of life at 1 year. The patient's outcome was worse when the treatment received did not follow the model's recommendation. This decision analysis model may be useful to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes with standard clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "We have observed that some patients with isolated popliteal artery occlusions (PAOs) harbor varying degrees of organized clot, as suggested by the rapidity with which these occlusions are traversed with the Glidewire. We hypothesized that debulking such PAOs by using rheolytic thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and selective stenting (PTA/S) is safe and enables single-session treatment with minimal risk of embolization.\nBetween February 2004 and January 2007, 16 male patients (mean age, 68.9 +/- 11.1 years; range, 54-84 years) presenting with disabling claudication (n = 1), rest pain (n = 5), and tissue loss (n = 10; mean duration, 11 +/- 8 weeks; range, 4-26 weeks) were prospectively followed up after rheolytic thrombectomy and angioplasty and selective stenting of their PAO.\nThe mean occlusion length was 11.6 +/- 4.5 cm. After rheolytic thrombectomy, the occlusions were converted to long stenoses (mean length of 7.6 +/- 3.6 cm). Self-expanding stents were used in 10 of 16 (mean length of 8.3 +/- 4.4 cm). Additional recanalizations of occlusions of the iliac artery and proximal superficial femoral artery were performed before popliteal artery recanalizations in two patients. Ankle-brachial indexes increased from 0.27 +/- 0.22 to 0.94 +/- 0.13. No case of distal embolization was observed. Adjuvant thrombolysis was used in only one case to improve runoff. Inline flow to the foot was achieved in 15 of 16 cases. Three occlusions occurred at 3, 6, and 20 months after surgery (mean follow-up, 15.7 +/- 10.0 months), and two patients underwent successful thrombolysis. The third patient refused further intervention and remains a claudicant. One-year primary and secondary patency rates were 84% and 92%, respectively. Two limb losses occurred at 7 and 9 months as a result of recurrent foot infection in patients with diabetes, both with patent popliteal arteries (1-year limb salvage rate, 83%).\nWe advocate debulking isolated subacute PAOs with rheolytic thrombectomy when they are easily crossed, because this enables recanalization of these lesions in a single setting, thus obviating the additional need for thrombolysis in most cases, with seemingly minimal risk of distal embolization. This simple approach is effective and widely available.",

    "abstract": "Para-anastomotic aneurysms involving the aorta and iliac arteries can occur years after aortic surgery and are at risk for rupture and erosion into surrounding structures. We report on our continued experience with patients who have been treated for these lesions with endovascular management as an alternative to traditional open repair.\nPatients who underwent endovascular repair of para-anastomotic aneurysms involving the distal aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, or iliac arteries were prospectively followed up in a database. Patient comorbidities, initial aortic pathology, initial graft configuration, aneurysm characteristics, evidence of infection, type and configuration of endograft used, and follow-up were analyzed.\nFrom 1997 to 2006, 53 patients with 65 para-anastomotic aneurysms were treated with endovascular stent grafts. Patients who were originally treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease presented significantly later than those treated for aneurysmal disease (15.8 vs 8.9 years, P < .01) The initial technical success rate was 98%. Endoleaks were identified in six patients (11%) < or =1 month of surgery, and three required reintervention, including open conversions. Endoleak complications were significantly associated with patients who had symptomatic para-anastomotic aneurysms (P = .01). Perioperative mortality after endovascular repair was 3.8%. Overall mortality within a mean follow-up of 18 months was 49% and was significantly associated with older age at the time of endovascular treatment (P = .03).\nEndovascular repair of para-anastomotic aneurysms involving the aorta and iliac arteries is technically feasible and is associated with a low perioperative morbidity and mortality. Close follow-up is required to identify endoleaks. Long-term survival is limited in older patients.

Patients who were originally treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease presented significantly later than those treated for aneurysmal disease (15.8 vs 8.9 years, P < .01) The initial technical success rate was 98%. Endoleaks were identified in six patients (11%) < or =1 month of surgery, and three required reintervention, including open conversions. Endoleak complications were significantly associated with patients who had symptomatic para-anastomotic aneurysms (P = .01). Perioperative mortality after endovascular repair was 3.8%. Overall mortality within a mean follow-up of 18 months was 49% and was significantly associated with older age at the time of endovascular treatment (P = .03).",

    "abstract": "To compare endovascular and open repair of isolated or solitary iliac artery aneurysms (SIAAs).\nWe present the results of 55 patients with 58 SIAAs that were treated between January 1998 and December 2005 in two European university hospitals. In one center, the standard procedure, if not contraindicated, was endovascular repair, and 32 (58.2%) consecutive patients with 33 SIAAs were treated by using only endovascular techniques (endovascular iliac aneurysm repair; EVIAR). In the second center, 23 (41.8%) consecutive patients with 25 SIAAs were treated by conventional surgical techniques because advanced endovascular skills were not available before late 2005. EVIAR included coil embolization of the hypogastric artery in 13 of the 33 cases with aneurysmal involvement of the internal iliac artery. In the \"open\" group of patients, midline laparotomy and a transperitoneal approach with bifurcated aortoiliac graft replacement was performed in 4 cases, and a lower lateral abdominal incision with a retroperitoneal approach and iliac replacement was performed in 19 cases.\nThe mean follow-up period was similar in both groups (EVIAR, 35.3 +/- 21.3 months; open, 31.3 +/- 19.9 months). The two groups of patients had similar demographic and clinical characteristics compared with previous reported series, and data analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups only in hypertension. The early and mid-term outcomes and especially the 3-year primary patency rates were also similar between the two groups (EVIAR, 97%; open, 100%). In the EVIAR group, there was no evidence of endoleaks, kinking, or graft migration, and 26 aneurysms remained stable, whereas in 7 aneurysms a slight decrease in size (>10% in diameter) was observed. Comparison of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay revealed significant differences (P < .001) in favor of the endovascular group. Secondary intervention was not necessary in any patient in either group during the entire follow-up period.\nElective management with endovascular or open techniques of isolated iliac aneurysms can be accomplished with very low morbidity and mortality rates. Better intraoperative and early postoperative outcomes, as well as the durable mid-term results in our EVIAR-treated patients, indicate that endovascular techniques could be offered as first-line therapy of SIAAs.",

    "abstract": "Venous ulcers are a major health problem because of their high prevalence and associated high cost of care. Compression therapy is the most widely used treatment for this condition. The vast majority of published articles on compression therapy present the results in the treatment of venous ulcers usually up to 15 to 20 cm(2). However, there are no published data in English medical literature on the efficacy of compression therapy in the treatment of extensive venous ulcers (ulcers >20 cm(2) of more than 6 months' duration) with regard to healing rate, time to healing, and recurrence rate at 12 months after healing.\nA total of 138 patients with extensive venous ulceration (ulceration surface, 20-210 cm(2); duration, 7 months to 28 years) were randomized into 2 groups: (1) a treatment group (72 patients who were treated by using a multilayer bandaging system with the Tubulcus (a heelless open-toed elastic compression device knitted in tubular form) and elastic bandages and (2) a control group (66 patients treated with a multilayer bandaging system with elastic bandages only). The patients were treated on an ambulatory basis; the primary end point of the study was complete ulcer healing at 500 days. The secondary end point was to assess the ulcer recurrence rate during continuation of below-knee compression of different degrees of compression. In the treatment group, patients were instructed to continue to wear the Tubulcus (35 mm Hg), and patients in the control group were instructed to wear compression stockings with compression of 20 to 25 mm Hg. The exclusion criteria from the study were heart insufficiency with an ejection fraction <35, an ankle-brachial pressure index less than 0.8, and pregnancy.\nThe cumulative healing rate was 93% in the treatment group and was 51% in the control group (P < .001). The median healing time in the treatment group was 133 days (range, 28 to 464 days), and in the control group it was 211 days (range, 61 to 438 days). The recurrence rate at 12 months in the treatment group was 24% (16/67) and was 53% (18/34) in the control group (P < .05). After additional compression treatment with the same treatment protocol, all 16 recurrent ulcers in the treatment group healed. In the control group, the healing rate of recurrent ulcers was 89% (16/18).\nThis study suggests that for extensive venous ulceration, multilayer compression therapy with the Tubulcus provides an extremely high healing rate. Compression of more than 30 mm Hg results in decreased ulcer recurrence. However, recurrence cannot be completely avoided.",

    "abstract": "To validate the use of fluoroscopic roentgenographic stereophotogrammetric analysis (FRSA) for its feasibility and accuracy for measuring the three-dimensional dynamic motion of stent grafts.\nA digital biplane fluoroscopy setup was calibrated (Siemens Axiom Artis dBc). Stereo images were acquired of a static aortic model with a stent graft in different axial positions, imposed by a micromanipulator. The three-dimensional measurement error of FRSA was determined by comparing FRSA measurements with the micromanipulator. An aortic model with a stent graft was constructed and connected to an artificial circulation with a physiological flow and pressure profile. Markers were added to the spine (tantalum spherical markers; diameter 1 mm) and stent (welding tin; diameter 1 mm). The three-dimensional measurement precision was determined by measuring the position of a single (stable) spine marker during two pulsatile cycles. Finally, three-dimensional stent marker motion was analyzed with a frame rate of 30 images per second, including three-dimensional marker position (change), diameter change, and center of circle position change.\nThe mean error of FRSA measurement of displacement was 0.003 mm (SD, 0.019 mm; maximum error, 0.058 mm). A very high precision of position measurement was found (SD, 0.009-0.015 mm). During pulsatile motion, the position (changes) of the markers could be assessed in the x, y, and z directions, as well as the stent diameter change and center of circle position change.\nFRSA has proven to be a method with very high accuracy and temporal resolution to measure three-dimensional stent-graft motion in a pulsatile environment. This technique has the potential to contribute significantly to the knowledge of stent-graft behavior after endovascular aneurysm repair and improvements in stent-graft design. The technique is ready for clinical testing.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, an arterial tissue-engineered vascular media (TEVM) was produced from cultured human smooth muscle cells of the umbilical artery and we took advantage of this model to evaluate the regulation of contraction and the signalling pathways of polyphenols in arteries.\nCultured human smooth muscle cells of the umbilical artery were used to produce arterial TEVMs. Contraction experiments were performed to determine intracellular targets involved in the modulation of contraction by polyphenols extract from red wine, Provinols (SEPPIC Groupe Air Liquide, Paris, France).\nSmooth muscle cells in arterial TEVM displayed a differentiated phenotype as demonstrated by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, a vascular smooth muscle-specific marker, and tissue contraction in response to vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents. Contractions caused by histamine were associated with an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a Ca(2+)-independent signalling pathway. The latter pathway involved mechanisms sensitive to protein kinase C, myosin light chain kinase, and Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitors. The regulation of contraction induced by Provinols shows that treatment of arterial TEVM with this compound significantly decreased histamine-induced contraction. This effect was associated with the inhibition of the Rho-associated protein kinase pathway and the decrease in alpha-smooth muscle actin expression.\nThe use of arterial TEVM, brings new insights into the mechanisms by which polyphenols regulate vascular contraction in the human artery.",

    "results": "Smooth muscle cells in arterial TEVM displayed a differentiated phenotype as demonstrated by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, a vascular smooth muscle-specific marker, and tissue contraction in response to vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents. Contractions caused by histamine were associated with an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a Ca(2+)-independent signalling pathway. The latter pathway involved mechanisms sensitive to protein kinase C, myosin light chain kinase, and Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitors. The regulation of contraction induced by Provinols shows that treatment of arterial TEVM with this compound significantly decreased histamine-induced contraction. This effect was associated with the inhibition of the Rho-associated protein kinase pathway and the decrease in alpha-smooth muscle actin expression.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular occlusion of the celiac artery can be performed along with occlusion of a celiac trunk aneurysm or stenting of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm to prevent a type II endoleak. Because only a few individual cases have been previously available for study, the aim of this study was to examine the technical details, clinical course, and outcome of this procedure based on a group of patients.\nThis retrospective study included 10 patients who underwent endovascular occlusion of the celiac artery between 1998 and 2006 (female/male = 1:4, mean age, 62.5 +/- 9.8 years). There were five aneurysms of the celiac artery, two cases each of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and dissecting thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, and one mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the aorta. The mean follow-up period was 21.4 +/- 29.1 months.\nThe celiac artery was successfully occluded in all cases, along with exclusion of the celiac artery aneurysm or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, respectively. The pancreaticoduodenal arteries were the main collateral pathways, but other anastomoses and, especially, vascular variations of the celiac artery and its territory were also significant. In one patient, abdominal angina was treated by percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the superior mesenteric artery.\nEndovascular occlusion of the celiac artery is both safe and feasible. Some vascular variations may make occlusion of the celiac trunk impossible. Liver function disorder is a relative contraindication for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with the development of a procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state. Tissue factor (TF) and its naturally occurring inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), play a central role in the initiation and progression of such a hypercoagulable state, but their role in patients undergoing open AAA repair has not previously been examined.\nA prospective study was conducted of 17 patients undergoing elective AAA repair and 10 patients undergoing emergency AAA repair. Blood was taken before induction, and 5 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours after aortic cross-clamp release and assayed for plasma TF, TFPI, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activities.\nTF activity was significantly higher at all time points in patients with ruptured AAA compared with nonruptured AAA. The median (interquartile range, IRQ) TF activity (AU/mL) was 9.9 vs 3.2 (IRQ, 5.9 to 12.6 vs 2.0 to 7.6; P = .005) at preinduction; 10.7 vs 1.5 (IRQ, 9.2 to 18.3 vs 0.1 to 6.6; P = .003) at 5 minutes after clamp release; 9.5 vs 3.3 (IRQ, 7.0 to 13.5 vs 1.0 to 7.9; P = .013) at 24 hours, and 9.6 vs 3.9 (IRQ, 7.6 to 12.6 vs 2.4 to 8.7; P = .006) at 48 hours. TFPI levels were not significantly different between ruptured AAA and nonruptured AAA before or during operation but became significantly elevated at 24 and 48 hours in patients who had undergone repair of ruptured AAA. Ruptured AAA repair was associated with a hypofibrinolytic state compared with nonruptured AAA.\nThe present study has demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that ruptured AAA is associated with significantly higher perioperative levels of circulating TF compared with nonruptured AAA. Furthermore, in the immediate perioperative period, the high levels of TF are not associated with a corresponding rise in TFPI levels, indicating an unopposed prothrombotic state. Direct inhibition of TF by administration of anti-TF antibodies or recombinant TFPI remains to be evaluated in subjects presenting with hemorrhage due to ruptured AAA, but if given early enough, it may attenuate the early deleterious effects of unopposed TF expression and ultimately contribute to improved outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cutting balloon angioplasty in the treatment of infrainguinal vein bypass graft stenosis.\nData from a prospective database, supplemented by chart review, were obtained on all patients who underwent cutting balloon angioplasty of lower extremity vein bypass grafts at a single institution during a 4-year period. Noninvasive duplex ultrasound imaging of grafts, along with measurement of ankle-brachial indices and digital pressures, was performed on all patients before and after treatment with the cutting balloon. Efficacy of cutting balloon angioplasty and procedural complications were analyzed. Data from noninvasive vascular testing were compared using the two-tailed paired Student t test. Patency rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in patency rates were compared using the log-rank test.\nFrom July 2002 to February 2006, 109 cutting balloon angioplasties were performed on 70 bypasses in 61 patients. There were 12 complications in 109 procedures (11%), only one of which required immediate operative intervention. Initial technical success was 96%. Noninvasive vascular testing indicators significantly improved immediately after intervention: peak systolic graft velocity decreased from 360 +/- 158 cm/s to 143 +/- 67 cm/s (P < .001), ankle-brachial index improved from 0.55 +/- 0.3 to 0.85 +/- 0.2 (P < .001), and digital pressure increased from 31 +/- 30 mm Hg to 62 +/- 32 mm Hg (P < .001). Patency rates at 6 months according to the Kaplan-Meier method were primary patency, 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.60); assisted primary patency, 72% (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.83); and secondary patency, 99% (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.00). At 6 months, cumulative limb salvage was 94% (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.00).\nCutting balloon angioplasty of infrainguinal vein bypass graft stenosis is technically feasible but is associated with a relatively high complication rate and a relatively low short-term patency rate.",

Color duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging of the abdominal aorta, renal vasculature, and kidney parenchyma was performed. The resistivity index of the kidney (RI) was measured, and 0.8 was used as a cutoff to identify those with severe kidney disease that could be excluded from an intervention. Incidental findings were also noted.\nA total of 324 patients were included from September 1998 to August 2003. Unilateral RAS was found in 14% and bilateral in 7%.

Most patients (63%) were taking two or more antihypertensive drugs. The diagnostic yield was 22% among those using two drugs and 55% among those using three or more. In 46 patients (64%), the RI was <0.8. Seven cases of fibromuscular dysplasia were found (10% of RAS patients or 2% overall). Incidental findings were detected in 24% and were significant enough to alter management in 26% among those with such findings.\nOur study identified a RAS prevalence of 22% and a renal artery occlusion prevalence of 4%. There was a high yield for RAS in patients receiving three or more drugs; however, the yield was also significant among those receiving two or more. About two thirds of patients diagnosed with RAS were potential revascularization candidates, evidenced by a low RI.

Seventeen patients, including three patients who underwent prior endovascular repair at other centers, required surgical conversion with complete (n = 9) or partial graft removal (n = 8). Five patients required immediate conversion (acute), and 12 underwent delayed conversion 4 to 72 months after endovascular repair. Indications for acute conversion were large type I endoleak (n = 3, 60%), including one patient with graft migration, and retroperitoneal bleeding (n = 2, 40%). Indications for chronic conversion were endoleak with increasing aneurysm size (n = 9, 75%), stent fracture without endoleak (n = 1, 8%), delayed retroperitoneal bleeding (n = 1, 8%), and infection (n = 1, 8%). Suprarenal aortic cross-clamping was required in two patients (12%), and endograft components were retained in eight (47%). An aortic occlusion balloon placed through the body of the existing endograft facilitated proximal control in three patients. There were two perioperative deaths in the acute conversion group (2/5; 40%) and none in the delayed conversion group (P = .04). Five-year actuarial survival was 71.9%. Mean follow-up was 41.6 +/- 32.2 months. Retained endovascular components in patients with partial graft removal remained stable during follow-up.\nSurgical conversion after endovascular AAA repair can be performed without suprarenal clamping in most patients. Endovascular aortic control with a balloon avoids suprarenal exposure. Partial endograft removal in selected patients facilitates open conversion and appears durable. Acute conversion is associated with increased mortality.",

There were two perioperative deaths in the acute conversion group (2/5; 40%) and none in the delayed conversion group (P = .04). Five-year actuarial survival was 71.9%. Mean follow-up was 41.6 +/- 32.2 months. Retained endovascular components in patients with partial graft removal remained stable during follow-up.",

    "abstract": "To review the treatment of blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BAI) at a single institution over the past 12 years and compare pre-, peri-, and postoperative variables and outcomes of both open (OR) and thoracic endovascular (TEVAR) repair of these injuries.\nAll cases of confirmed BAI from 1994 to present were included in this retrospective review. Data collected included demographic data, injury severity score, Glasgow coma score, arrival hemodynamic variables, and associated injuries. Operative data included: type of procedure (OR or TEVAR), duration of procedure, need for and amount of blood transfused, use of anticoagulation, type of anesthesia, and service performing the procedure. Outcomes evaluated were: death, paraplegia, length of stay, days ventilated, and procedure related complications. Specific to EVAR; access, stent graft type and number, presence of endoleak and long-term clinical and radiologic follow-up were evaluated.\nThirty cases of blunt thoracic aortic injury were identified. Two patients received no treatment and died, 28 patients were treated (OR 16, TEVAR 12) and included for comparison. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to preoperative variables with the exception of significantly more associated intra-abdominal injuries in the TEVAR group (P = .03). Five patients in the OR group (31.2%) died in the perioperative period. There were no deaths in the TEVAR group (P =.05). One OR patient (6.25%) suffered postoperative paraplegia. No paraplegia occurred in the TEVAR group. Intraoperative variables were similar between groups with the exception of mean units of blood transfused (OR 8.5 units, vs TEVAR 0.2 units, P = .002). Ten patients in the OR group either died or had a procedure related complication compared with none in the TEVAR group (P = .001). There was no difference in length of stay or length of mechanical ventilation between the groups. There were no procedure or device related complications in the TEVAR group during follow-up (mean 15.3 months, range 1 to 53.5 months).\nEndovascular repair of BAI results in significantly less combined mortality and morbidity when compared to OR. Significantly less blood is needed intraoperatively in the TEVAR group. No complications from stent graft insertion have been observed during follow-up. Endovascular repair is replacing open repair as the treatment of choice for BAI at our institution.",

    "abstract": "Anemia is a common comorbid condition in various inflammatory states and an established predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and end-stage renal disease. The present study of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) undergoing endovascular repair (EVAR) assessed the relationships between baseline hemoglobin concentration and AAA size, as well as anemia and long-term survival.\nBetween March 1994 and November 2006, 711 patients (65 women, mean age 75.8 +/- 7.8 years) underwent elective EVAR. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. Post-EVAR mean follow-up was 48.3 +/- 32.0 months. Association of hemoglobin level with AAA size was assessed with multiple linear regression. Mortality was determined with use of the internet-based Social Security Death Index and the electronic hospital record. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of anemic and nonanemic patient groups were compared by the log-rank method. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of anemia on vital status after EVAR.\nA total of 218/711 (30.7%) of AAA patients undergoing EVAR had anemia at baseline. After adjustment for various risk factors, hemoglobin level was inversely related to maximum AAA diameter (beta: - .144, 95%-CI: -1.482 - .322, P = .002). Post-EVAR survival was 65.5% at 5 years and 44.4% at 10 years. In long-term follow-up, survival was significantly lower in patients with anemia as compared to patients without anemia (P < .0001 by log-rank). Baseline hemoglobin levels were independently related to long-term mortality in multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for various risk factors (adjusted HR: 0.866, 95% CI: .783 to .958, P = .005). Within this model, statin use (adjusted HR: .517, 95% CI: .308 to .868, P = .013) was independently related to long-term survival, whereas baseline AAA diameter (adjusted HR: 1.022, 95% CI: 1.009 to 1.036, P = .001) was an independently associated with increased mortality.\nBaseline hemoglobin concentration is independently associated with AAA size and reduced long-term survival following EVAR. Thus, the presence or absence of anemia offers a potential refinement of existing risk stratification instruments.",

Additionally, statin treatment significantly reduces perioperative as well as long-term morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing carotid surgery or endovascular interventions. It would also be expected that statins would reduce coronary events in this high-risk population.\nStatins should be considered as an essential component of the therapeutic approach of patients with carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "This article reports the case of a 17-year-old girl who presented with compartment syndrome and acute ischemia of the foot after a minor ankle sprain. The suspected cause of compartment syndrome was secondary emergence of swelling and palsy of the foot. The posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were nonpalpable. The syndrome was confirmed by measurement of the pressures in the compartments of the foot, which were >30 mm Hg. Foot fasciotomy was successfully performed by using a three-incision technique. In contrast with previous case reports, no bone or vessel lesion was detected to explain the onset of a compartment syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report compartment syndrome of the foot after an isolated minor ankle injury. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of compartment syndrome of the foot emerging irrespective of the severity of the initial trauma.",

We present two cases of giant-sized abdominal aortic aneurysms, one was juxtarenal and one was a Crawford type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm, that were repaired by using open proximal anastomosis under hypothermic total circulatory arrest and a transabdominal approach. This technique may be useful for both thoracoabdominal and large abdominal aortic aneurysms because it offers the opportunity to not clamp the aorta and operate in bloodless surgical field.",

    "abstract": "The use of sirolimus eluting stent (SES) has strongly limited the incidence of in-stent restenosis that still remains a problem at the stent edge. The aim of this study was to analyze the neointimal thickening after implantation of SES and to assess the influence of the stent implantation procedure on the neointimal thickening in the in-stent segment and at the edge of the stent in an ex-vivo model of stented human artery.\nBoth balloon expandable SES and the corresponding bare metal stent (BMS) were used in a model of human mammary artery culture. Stents were implanted either directly or after predilatation (10 atm, 60 seconds) and analysis of arterial segments were performed at 28 days poststenting. Cell proliferation and neointimal thickening were assessed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and histomorphometry, both in the in-stent segment and at the edge of the stent. Neointimal thickening was expressed as the ratio ([neointimal area/neointimal area + media area]).\nThe in-stent neointimal thickening was dramatically inhibited in the SES group compared with the BMS group whatever the stenting technique was (predilatation: 0.22 +/- 0.05 vs 0.30 +/- 0.10; P < .04; direct stenting 0.16 +/- 0.04 vs 0.30 +/- 0.13; P <.01). This effect of SES was associated with a smallest expression of the small G protein RhoA and an increase of p27kip expression. In the BMS group, predilatation and direct stenting gave similar in-stent neointimal thickening. In contrast, in the SES group, in-stent neointimal thickening was significantly reduced when direct stenting was performed (0.16 +/- 0.04 [direct stenting] vs 0.22 +/- 0.05 [predilatation], P < .03). At the stent edge, a similar neointimal thickening was observed with both type of stent when predilatation was performed on the entire segment of the artery. Direct stenting significantly reduced the neointimal thickness at the stent edge when SES where used (0.06 +/- 0.01 [direct stenting] vs 0.19 +/- 0.06 [predilatation]; P < .001) but not in the BMS group.\nThese results confirm the efficiency of sirolimus released form SES to inhibit RhoA expression and to increase p27kip level in the arterial wall and show the benefit of direct stenting to limit the edge effect with SES.",

    "abstract": "Limited experience with bioprosthetic venous valve percutaneously inserted into femoral veins in 15 patients has been promising in short-term results only to show disappointing long-term results. Percutaneous autogenous venous valve (PAVV) transplantation was explored in an ovine model as a possible alternative treatment.\nPAVV consisted of a vein segment containing a valve that was attached to a stent template. The stent templates (n = 9) were designed and hand made in our research laboratory. They consist of two stainless steel square stents 13 or 15 mm in diameter to fit the ovine jugular veins (JV), which ranges from 10 to 15 mm in diameter. A valve-containing segment of JV was harvested and attached with sutures and barbs inside the stent template (n = 9). The valve devices were then manually folded and front loaded inside the 4 cm chamber of the 13F delivery sheath and delivered into the contralateral JV by femoral vein approach. Transplanted PAVVs were studied by immediate and 3 months venograms. Animals were euthanized at 3 months, and jugular veins harvested to perform angioscopic evaluations in vitro.\nPAVV transplantation was successful in all nine animals. Good valve function with no reflux was observed on immediate and 3 months venograms in eight valves. The transplanted maximal JV diameter ranged from 10.2 mm to 15.4 mm (mean 13.1 +/- 1.5 mm). Venoscopic examination revealed intact, flexible, nonthickened valve leaflets in eight specimens. One PAVV exhibited normal function of one leaflet only; the other cusp was accidentally cut during the transplantation procedure. All transplanted autologous valves were free of thrombus and incorporated into the vein wall of the host vessel.\nThis study demonstrated that autogenous valve transplants remained patent and competent without long-term anticoagulation for up to 3 months. The percutaneous autogenous venous valve may provide in future minimally invasive treatment for patients with chronic deep venous insufficiency, but long-term studies need to be done to document its continued patency and function.",

This study was undertaken to measure tissue pressures in PTS and SVI limbs and to evaluate the impact of removal of superficial venous reflux with or without concomitant subcutaneous fasciotomy.\nIn eight patients with recurrent, therapy-resistant venous leg ulcers, due to PTS (11 limbs, 12 ulcers) and 14 patients with severe SVI (14 limbs, 14 ulcers), subcutaneous fasciotomy was performed in addition to removal of superficial reflux. They were compared with eight patients with PTS (11 limbs, 11 ulcers) and 10 patients with SVI (13 limbs, 13 ulcers) who did not have fasciotomy in addition to removal of their superficial venous reflux. Intramuscular (i.m.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) tissue pressures and transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO(2)) were measured prior to, immediately after, and 3 months following the surgical intervention. Healing of ulcer (spontaneous or by skin grafting) at 3 months was also observed.\nThere were no statistical differences between the groups regarding gender and age distribution or ulcer age at the time of surgery. All patients had in addition to surgery compression stockings class II (30 mm Hg). The i.m. tissue pressure was higher in patients with PTS compared with SVI patients, while s.c. tissue pressure and TcPO(2) did not differ between the groups. When fasciotomy was performed, i.m. and s.c. tissue pressures decreased and TcPO(2) increased significantly. Without fasciotomy, only s.c. tissue pressure decreased first at 3 months postoperatively. In the SVI-group, i.m tissue pressure was significantly decreased at 3 months in the group without fasciotomy.\nPatients with severe chronic venous insufficiency with therapy-resistant or recurrent ulcer disease due to deep and superficial insufficiency have higher i.m. tissue pressures than patients with only superficial venous reflux, even though both groups have higher i.m. and s.c. tissue pressures compared with normal values. Eradication of all superficial reflux lowers s.c. tissue pressure, while additional fasciotomy lowers both i.m. and s.c. tissue pressures and increases TcPO(2), which seems to promote ulcer healing.",

    "abstract": "Chronic ischemia of the upper extremity requiring surgical revascularization is an uncommon condition. We analyzed modes of presentation, methods of operative repair, and follow-up in all consecutive patients with chronic ischemia of the upper extremity requiring arterial bypass.\nData prospectively entered into a vascular registry was retrospectively analyzed for all patients undergoing upper extremity arterial bypass from January 1, 1990, to June 30, 2003. Simple thromboembolectomy procedures and bypasses to an outflow target more proximal than the brachial artery were excluded.\nWe identified 20 patients. Their mean age was 57 years, and 11 (55%) were women. Eight (40%) had diabetes, and five (25%) had renal insufficiency. Indications included exercise intolerance in 11 patients (55%), tissue loss in six (30%), and rest pain in three (15%). The etiology of ischemia was atherosclerosis in seven patients (35%) and complications of iatrogenic or civilian trauma in 13 (65%). The brachial artery was used as the inflow in 13 patients (65%), the axillary in six (30%), and the ulnar in one (5%). Conduits used included the great saphenous vein in 11 patients (55%), arm vein in 7 (35%), and prosthetic in 2 (10%). Outflow targets included the brachial artery in 12 patients (55%), the radial in five (25%), and the ulnar in three (15%). There were no perioperative deaths. One graft (5%) occluded <or=30 days of surgery. Mean follow-up was 12 months. Mean survival after bypass was 62 months. Patency at 1 and 3 years was 85%. Two patients had associated minor amputations (a finger and a partial hand). Limb salvage rate was 100%.\nAlthough upper extremity ischemia is rare, results for upper extremity bypass are excellent and superior to those reported for lower extremity ischemia. These results may reflect the indications, which differ considerably from those for lower extremity bypass, with the most being performed for complications of trauma.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to review our experience with embolic protection devices (EPDs) during carotid artery stenting (CAS). Specifically, we aimed to verify their clinical effectiveness and to compare clinical outcomes between specific devices and types of EPDs.\nThe CAS databases at four participating centers were reviewed. Adverse events were defined as death, stroke (>24 hours), or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (<24 hours). We compared the risk of procedural and 30-day events between patients treated with and without an EPD. We also compared these risks between different EPDs and between the different types of EPDs.\nA total of 3160 CAS procedures using nine EPDs were analyzed. The risk of a procedural adverse event was 0.9% in protected and 2.3% in unprotected procedures (P = .12). Compared with the most frequently used device (FilterWire, Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass), there was no significant difference in the risk of procedural adverse events for any of the other EPDs. There was, however, an increased risk of 30-day adverse events with the Accunet (Abbott Vascular, Redwood, Calif) filter compared with the FilterWire (relative risk [RR] 2.67, confidence interval [CI] 1.41 to 5.04, P = .005). Pairwise comparison of proximal occlusion balloons to filters, distal occlusion balloons to filters, and proximal to distal occlusion balloons revealed no significant difference in the risk of procedural or 30-day adverse events. There was no significant difference in risk of procedural events between eccentric and concentric filters, however, the relative risk of eccentric compared with concentric filters at 30 days was 0.59 (unadjusted, CI 0.38 to 0.92, P = .04). This difference was still apparent after adjustment for risk factors (RR 0.61, CI 0.39 to 0.95, P = .06), but not after adjustment for risk factors and stent-type [(open-cell vs closed-cell) RR 0.76, CI 0.47 to 1.22, P = .51].\nThe use of EPDs is associated with a low risk of procedural adverse events. We were unable to detect significant differences in risks of procedural adverse events between different devices or types of devices. We speculate that the observed differences seen at 30 days are largely attributable to differences in stent-type used.",

Surgical approach, type of graft, and anastomotic and ligation techniques were studied. After mean 7.2 years (range, 2 to 18 years) information on amputation was obtained for all patients, and 190 patients were re-examined with ultrasound imaging.\nThe approaches used were medial (medial approach group, MAG) in 87%, posterior (PAG) in 8.4%, endovascular in 3.6%, and other in 1.4%. Primary patency at 1 year with venous and prosthetic grafts was 85% vs 81% in the PAG (P = .719) and 90% vs 72% in the MAG (P < .001). Sixty-three legs (8.8%) were amputated <or=1 year, and 80 (11%) had been amputated at re-examination or by the end of follow-up. The median time from operation to amputation of 17 legs amputated after 1 year was 3.1 years (range, 1.1 to 9.8 years). The frequency of late amputation was 3.7% (2/54) in the PAG and 2.6% (15/571) in the MAG.

    "abstract": "This was a study of intra-aneurysm sac pressures in patients who presented with endoleaks after endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nTwenty-five patients (18 men, 7 women) with endoleaks, age (IQR 68 to 80), underwent 31 direct intra-aneurysm sac pressure measurements, DISP at 16 months after EVAR (IQR, 14 to 26 months). Diameter of AAA was 59 mm (IQR, 52 to 67 mm). Six patients underwent DISP twice. Tip-pressure sensors were used through direct translumbar puncture of the AAA except in three patients (transabdominal puncture in 2; endoluminal in 1). Mean pressure index (MPI) was calculated between simultaneously registered intra-aneurysm sac and systemic pressures. Values presented are medians with interquartile range (IQR).\nType I endoleaks (n = 1) showed MPI of 93% in the nidus and 62% in the thrombus. Type II endoleaks were associated with lower MPIs in the thrombus (35%; IQR 24% to 38%) when AAAs shrank (n = 4) compared with when the AAAs remained unchanged (n = 11; MPI, 78%; IQR, 47% to 85%) or expanded (n = 6; MPI, 74%; IQR, 58% to 87%; P = .019). The nidus of type II endoleaks (MPI, 79%; IQR, 70% to 90%) had higher pressure than the thrombus (45%, IQR, 34% to 85%; P = .047; n = 7). Successful embolization of type II endoleaks led to AAA shrinkage (n = 3; MPI reduction, 13% to 31%) or diameter stability (n = 3; unchanged MPIs, 37% to 44%). Type III endoleaks (n = 3) had MPIs in the thrombus of 33% to 70%.\nEndoleaks after EVAR pressurize the AAA sac nonuniformly, with higher, near-systemic, pressure in the endoleak nidus compared with the thrombus. Nevertheless, type II endoleaks in shrinking AAAs have lower intra-sac pressure than expanding or stable aneurysms, and successful endoleak embolization reduces pressure.",

    "abstract": "Vascular screening events have become a popular way to increase vascular awareness. Most screenings programs involve multiple locations on a single date and do not explore the local impact of screening. We evaluated the economic and community impact of the Dare to C.A.R.E. (DTC) program, a large, single center, continuous vascular screening and education program in Annapolis, Maryland.\nBetween July 2000 and July 2006, DTC was offered free to the public for those over 60 or over 50 with risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or elevated cholesterol. DTC consisted of a 2-hour educational lecture, completing a risk factor questionnaire, and testing blood pressure, carotid duplex, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ultrasound, and pedal pulse/ankle-brachial index (ABI). Mild disease (MD) was defined as 1% to 39% carotid stenosis or an ABI between .7 and .95; intermediate disease (ID) as carotid stenosis >or=40%, AAA >or=3 cm, or an ABI <or=0.7; and severe disease (SD) as carotid stenosis >or=60%, AAA >or=5 cm, or an ABI <or=0.5. Results were discussed with the participants and forwarded to their primary physicians. Questionnaire data and screening results were analyzed and local hospital data was examined to determine the effects of screening.\nA total of 12,055 screenings were performed in DTC, 439 were excluded due to age less than 40 or repeat visits, leaving 11,616 unique patients for this report. Participation grew from 189 in 2000 to over 6400 in 2005. Age ranged from 40 to 95 (median 65 years) and females comprised 58.7%. Demographics included past smokers (51.3%), current smokers (7.3%), diabetes mellitus (10.6%), hypertension (46.7%), hyperlipidemia (49.4%), and prior myocardial infarction (MI) (11.9%). 47% participants had evidence of at least mild disease (MD) with intermediate disease (ID) found in 6.9% and severe disease (SD) found in 2.2% of patients screened. Statistical analysis showed a greater prevalence of ID and SD in patients with risk factors. Diabetes alone doubled the prevalence of disease in all age groups. Over 340 hospital vascular cases were identified in DTC patients in the first 5 years of the program.\nThe Dare to C.A.R.E. vascular screening and education program is an effective way to detect early and significant vascular disease. It has a powerful effect on procedural and testing volumes.",

They underwent a clinical examination of the lower limbs, including presence and severity of visible signs (CEAP classification), and assessment of functional disease by color-coded duplex ultrasound imaging.\nVaricose veins and telangiectases were the most common objective signs in both men and women. Older people were more severely affected. Telangiectases were more frequent in women, and men had a higher incidence of trunk varices, trophic changes, and venous reflux. Frequency of both visible and functional venous disease increased with family history and body mass index. Presence of reflux correlated positively with increasing CEAP grade of visible disease (Pfor trend < .0001 for all superficial venous segments). A large number of subjects, especially women, complained of subjective symptoms in the legs, and the presence of symptoms correlated almost always positively with both worsening of visible findings (P for trend < .001) and presence of hemodynamic change in both genders.\nThe frequency of reflux increased with the severity of visible signs of disease as described by the CEAP classification. In men, the occurrence of subjective symptoms was mostly correlated with functional disorders.",

Hypertension is an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial disease. However, the prevalence and risk factors of PAD in hypertensive patients have not been studied in China.\nIn order to investigate the prevalence of PAD and its risk factors in China, a cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 4716 patients with hypertension and 833 age-gender matched people without hypertension were recruited; age 40 to 75 years, from seven rural communities. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <or= 0.9 in either leg; hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >or=140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure >or=90 mm Hg, or history of antihypertensive drug use.\nThe prevalence of PAD is 8.7% (n = 408) in patients with hypertension (n = 4716), higher than in people without hypertension (5.0%, n = 833, P = .004). Hypertensive patients with PAD were older, (61 +/- 8.6 vs 58 +/- 8.6, P < .01), had more conventional cardiovascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure (170 +/- 22.6 vs 167 +/- 22.7, P < .01), pulse pressure (72 +/- 19.7 vs 68 +/- 18.9, P < .01), blood glucose (5.8 +/- 2.2 vs 5.6 +/- 1.7, P < .05), total cholesterol (5.7 +/- 1.3 vs 5.5 +/- 1.1, P < .05), and serum uric acid (355 +/- 98.0 vs 293 +/- 86.2, P < .05) than the hypertensive patients without PAD.

Categorization of normal, moderate, and severe disease was determined hierarchically through clinical examination and ultrasonography imaging by trained vascular technologists, who also performed anthropometric measures. An interviewer administered a questionnaire and an examination assessed potential risk factors for venous disease suggested by previous reports.\nIn multivariable models, moderate venous disease was independently related to age, a family history of venous disease, previous hernia surgery, and normotension in both sexes. In men, current walking, the absence of cardiovascular disease, and not moving after sitting were also predictive. Additional predictors in women were weight, number of births, oophorectomy, flat feet, and not sitting. For severe disease, age, family history of venous disease, waist circumference, and flat feet were predictive in both sexes. In men, occupation as a laborer, cigarette smoking, and normotension were also independently associated with severe venous disease. Additional significant and independent predictors in women were hours standing, history of leg injury, number of births, and cardiovascular disease, but African American ethnicity was protective. Multiple other postulated risk factors for venous disease were not significant in multivariable analysis in this population.\nAlthough some risk factors for venous disease such as age, family history of venous disease, and findings suggestive of ligamentous laxity (hernia surgery, flat feet) are immutable, others can be modified, such as weight, physical activity, and cigarette smoking. Overall, these data provide modest support for the potential of behavioral risk-factor modification to prevent chronic venous disease.",

Following standard retrospective review, each surgeon's learning curve was analyzed using the cumulative sum failure method with a target success rate of 95% derived from the literature. The main outcome variable was primary technical success.\nThese 67 patients presented with several pathologies including elective (n = 31) and ruptured (n = 11) thoracic aortic aneurysms, acute dissections or aortic ulcers (n = 10), and acute blunt thoracic aortic trauma (n = 15). The mean age was 65 (range: 20 to 90) and the early (30 day) mortality rate was 19.4% in urgent cases (n = 36) and 0% in elective cases (n = 31). Paraplegia occurred in two patients (3%). Primary technical success was achieved in 62 cases (92.5%) and did not differ between surgeons (92.6%, 91.3%, 94.1%, respectively; P = .9). Each surgeon's cases were plotted sequentially and the resulting learning curves were similar. Although acceptable outcomes were obtained throughout the study period, improved results, compared with the target success rate, were not achieved until each surgeon treated 5 to 10 patients.\nThis study supports the case volume requirements of the Society for Vascular Surgery credentialing guidelines, which also requires extensive catheter and guidewire experience. With this background in catheter manipulation and endovascular abdominal aortic repair, surgeons can achieve optimal outcomes with thoracic aortic lesions following 5 to 10 cases.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the current study was to share a 6-year experience with the iliac bifurcation device (IBD) and determine its safety and effectiveness in patients with common iliac artery aneurysms.\nBetween 2001 and 2006, 46 patients were prospectively enrolled in a single institution study on the IBD. Indications included unilateral or bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms (CIAA) (combined or not with abdominal aortic aneurysm endovascular repair). The first 26 patients were intended to receive a first generation unibody IBD and the following 20 patients the second generation, modular, IBD.\nIn 33 patients out of 46 attempted (technical success per patient 72%), 35 iliac bifurcated devices (2 patients received bilateral IBD) out of 51 attempted (technical success per vessel 69%), were successfully implanted. The technical success rate (per vessel) was 58% for the first generation device and 85% for the second generation device. Inability to introduce the side branch into the IIA and intraoperative occlusions were the main reasons for technical failure. Among these failures, only two patients required open conversions. The mean +/- SD follow-up (radiological and clinical) of the 33 patients with a total of 35 successful IBD implantations was 26 +/- 17 months (median 24, range 3 to 60). During the follow-up period out of 35 successfully-implanted iliac bifurcation devices, four (11%) hypogastric side branch occlusions occurred, all within the first 12 months. Cumulative IBD side branch patency was 87% at 60 months. Comparing the first with the second generation IBD outcomes, cumulative patency rates at 2 years revealed no statistical difference (P = .774). No endoleak, and particularly no IBD, modular side branch disconnection, no late rupture, or deaths have yet been encountered.\nPreservation of pelvic circulation in high risk patients treated for bilateral or unilateral common iliac aneurysms combined or without AAA is feasible and secure exclusively by endovascular repair. New generation iliac bifurcated devices show a favourable intraoperative performance and long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Femoropopliteal bypass still is the standard surgical therapy for disabling claudication and critical ischemia. When autologous vein is not suitable synthetic or biological prostheses may be considered. Second generation glutaraldehyde tanned human umbilical vein (HUV) graft was chosen for above and below knee femoropopliteal bypass when autologous vein was not available. A single center experience regarding long-term graft function, secondary reinterventions, and potential biodegeneration of the HUV is presented.\nBetween January 1994 and January 2005, 211 consecutive femoropopliteal bypass operations with HUV (65 above knee and 146 below knee) were performed in 197 patients for disabling claudication (57), chronic critical ischemia (130), popliteal artery aneurysm (9), acute ischemia (14), or aneurysmal degeneration of a synthetic graft (1) in the absence of suitable ipsilateral great saphenous vein. Grafts were followed with duplex scan supplemented by additional angiography in case of recurrent ischemia with prospective documentation of follow-up data in a computerized vascular database. Surveillance of the HUV included routine evaluation of potential biodegeneration with duplex scan. Retrospective analysis of graft patency, limb salvage, and signs of aneurysmal degeneration was performed.\nMean (median) follow-up was 44 (35) months (range 1 to 143 months). Thirty-day mortality was 2.4%. Early postoperative bypass thrombosis after a median of 4 days postoperatively (0 to 30 days) prompted revision with thrombectomy in 16% of cases. Besides late bypass thrombosis in 14.7%, additional operative or endovascular reinterventions during follow-up to maintain or restore graft patency was necessary in 8.5% of bypasses. Primary, primary assisted, secondary patency rate, and limb salvage rate after 5 years were 54%, 63%, 76%, and 92%, respectively, for all bypasses with no significant difference between above and below knee anastomosis. Duplex scan identified segmental aneurysmal degeneration in six grafts, which led to operative reintervention in three cases. The rate of detected aneurysm for grafts patent for more than three years was 7% with a rate of reintervention for aneurysm of 3.5%.\nAlthough a considerable rate of early thrombotic occlusions occurred, excellent secondary graft patency and limb salvage combined with a tolerable rate of late aneurysmal degeneration detected by means of duplex scan surveillance justify the use of the HUV in femoropopliteal bypass surgery when ipsilateral autogenous vein is not suitable.",

    "abstract": "Level 1 evidence supports carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the standard treatment for severe (>70% lumen reduction) carotid stenosis in asymptomatic patients, though its safety and efficacy in high-risk patients remain controversial. Long-term survival and stroke-free survival after CEA may guide decisions concerning this procedure for asymptomatic patients, but this outcome has only been considered in few reports outside the large randomized trial setting. This study analyzed long-term survival and stroke-free survival after CEA and the impact of risk factors in a consecutive series of asymptomatic patients, including those with medical comorbidities and particular anatomical features believed to increase the perioperative morbidity and mortality of CEA.\nFor over 10 years, data were prospectively collected for all patients who underwent CEA for asymptomatic severe carotid disease at our institution. All CEAs performed by the same surgeon involved eversion technique, with patients under deep general anesthesia and continuous perioperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for selective shunting. All patients had neurological follow-up and duplex ultrasound at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. A complete follow-up (mean, 6.1 years; range, 0.1 to 10.6 years) was obtained in 348 patients (93%) with an overall 365 CEAs (93%). Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier life tables.\nAmong 374 patients undergoing 391 CEAs, there were no perioperative deaths or strokes. There were 17 (4.8%) late deaths, mainly cardiac-related (70%), and 2 (0.5%) non-fatal strokes. At 5 and 10 years, survival was 96.3% and 85.7%, and stroke-free survival was 95.6% and 84.8%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus (P = .002) and cardiac disease (P = .005) were independent predictors of a shorter long-term survival.\nEversion CEA proved safe and effective in a series of patients with asymptomatic severe carotid disease representing the typical population of daily clinical practice. Although long-term results were extremely favorable, excellent stroke-free survival was not translated into a longer patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Laser atherectomy offers a potential intervention for multivessel infrainguinal disease in patients with poor revascularization options. Despite promising early results reported in the literature, the proper patient population who might benefit from laser atherectomy has yet to be determined.\nFrom July 2004 to June 2006, patients undergoing laser atherectomy were retrospectively reviewed and assessed for comorbidities, operative and follow-up variables potentially associated with the end points of nondefinitive therapy, and limb salvage.\nDuring the study period, 40 patients (21 women, 19 men) underwent laser atherectomy, and the average follow-up was 461 +/- 49 days (range, 17 to 1050 days). Their average age was 68 +/- 2 years (range, 43 to 93 years). The indication for laser atherectomy was critical limb ischemia in 26 (65%) and lower limb claudication in 11 (35%). A total of 47 lesions were treated in the following arterial segments: 34 femoropopliteal and 13 infrapopliteal. Femoropopliteal distribution by the Trans-Atlantic Society Classification (TASC) was A in 3, B in 17, C in 10, D in 4, and infrapopliteal lesions distribution was A in 1, B in 3, C in 4, and D in 5. Adjunctive angioplasty was used in 75% of cases. The overall technical success rate (<50% residual stenosis) was 88%. Laser atherectomy-based treatment was the definitive therapy for 23 patients (58%), and the overall 12-month primary patency was 44%. The limb salvage rate at 12 months in 26 patients with critical limb ischemia was 55%. Renal failure was a risk factor for amputation (P < .001) and failed primary patency (P < .05), type 2 diabetes mellitus was a risk factor for amputation (P < .05), and poor tibial runoff was associated with failed primary patency and amputation (P < .05). Outcome was associated with the number of patent infrapopliteal runoff vessels.\nThese data demonstrate that laser atherectomy can be used with high initial technical success rate. Chronic renal failure and diabetes are risk factors for a negative outcome. Poor results in patients with diabetes and renal failure necessitate careful case selection in this subgroup, in which laser atherectomy is less likely to provide a definitive revascularization result or limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) is a proven diagnostic tool for the evaluation of carotid stenosis; however, its utility in planning carotid artery stenting (CAS) has not been addressed. This study assessed the accuracy of three-dimensional CE-MRA as a noninvasive screening tool, compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), for evaluating carotid and arch morphology before CAS.\nIn a series of 96 CAS procedures during a 2-year period, CE-MRAs and DSAs with complete visualization from the aortic arch to the intracranial circulation were obtained before CAS in 60 patients. Four additional patients, initially considered potential candidates for CAS, were also evaluated with CE-MRA and DSA. The two-by-two table method, receiver operating characteristic curve, and Bland-Altman analyses were used to characterize the ability of CE-MRA to discriminate carotid and arch anatomy, suitability for CAS, and degree of carotid stenosis.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of CE-MRA were, respectively, 100% and 100% to determine CAS suitability, 87% and 100% to define aortic arch type, 93% and 100% to determine severe carotid tortuosity, and 75% and 98% to detect ulcerated plaques. CE-MRA had 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of carotid stenosis >/=80%. The accuracy of CE MRA to determine optimal imaging angles and stent and embolic protection device sizes was >90%. The operative technique for CAS was altered because of the findings of preoperative CE-MRA in 22 procedures (38%). The most frequent change in the operative plan was the use of the telescoping technique in 11 cases (18%). CAS was aborted in four patients (5%) due to unfavorable anatomy identified on CE-MRA, including prohibitive internal carotid artery tortuosity (n = 1), long string sign of the internal carotid artery (n = 2), and concomitant intracranial disease (n = 1). Among patients considered suitable for CAS by CE-MRA, technical success was 100%, and the 30-day stroke/death rate was 1.6%.\nContrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of the arch and carotid arteries is accurate in determining suitability for CAS and may alter the operative technique. Certain anatomic contraindications for CAS may be detected without DSA. Although CE-MRA is less accurate to estimate the degree of stenosis, it can accurately predict imaging angles, and stent and embolic protection device size, which may facilitate safe and expeditious CAS.",

    "abstract": "Our prior study showed that resveratrol could suppress infarct volume and exert neuroprotective effect on rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) injury. Recently, it has been reported in some literature that resveratrol protects the spinal cord, kidney, and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through upregulation of nitric oxide (NO). Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the role of nitric oxide on the neuroprotective mechanisms of resveratrol on rats after FCI injury.\nThe FCI injury was induced by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion for 1 hour and then a 24-hour reperfusion followed in the anesthetized Long-Evans rats. Resveratrol was intravenously injected after 1 hour MCA occlusion.\nTreatment of resveratrol (0.1 and 1 microg/kg) decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma and malondialdehyde (MDA) in FCI injury brain tissue, whereas the level of NO in plasma was increased. In addition, resveratrol downregulated protein and mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and upregulated protein and mRNA expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), while the expression of protein and mRNA of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was unchanged. Pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, the nonselective NOS inhibitor) or L-N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO, the eNOS selective inhibitor) completely blocked the effect of resveratrol in decreasing infarction volumes.\nThis study demonstrated the important role of NO in the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol in FCI injury.",

    "abstract": "The relative safety of percutaneous carotid interventions remains controversial. Few studies have used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to evaluate the safety of these interventions. We compared the incidence and distribution of cerebral microembolic events after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with distal protection to standard open carotid endarterectomy (CEA) using DW-MRI.\nFrom November 2004 through August 2006, 69 carotid interventions (27 CAS, and 42 CEA) were performed in 68 males at a single institution. Pre- and postprocedure DW-MRI exams were obtained on each patient undergoing CAS and the 20 most recent CEA operations. These 46 patients (47 procedures as one patient underwent bilateral CEAs in a staged fashion) constitute our study sample, and the hospital records of these patients (27 CAS and 20 CEA) were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence and location of acute, postprocedural microemboli were determined using DW-MRIs and assessed independently by two neuroradiologists without knowledge of the subjects' specific procedure.\nNineteen CAS patients (70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 42%-81%) demonstrated evidence of postoperative, acute, cerebral microemboli by DW-MRI vs none of the CEA patients (0%, 95% CI: 0%-17%) (P < .0001). Of the 19 CAS patients with postoperative emboli, nine (47%) were ipsilateral to the index carotid lesion, three (16%) contralateral, and seven (36%) bilateral. The median number of ipsilateral microemboli identified in the CAS group was 1 (interquartile ranges [IQR]: 0-2, range 0-21). The median number of contralateral microemboli identified in the CAS group was 0 (IQR: 0-1, range 0-5). Three (11%) CAS patients experienced temporary neurologic sequelae lasting less than 36 hours. These patients suffered 12 (six ipsilateral and six contralateral), 20 (19 ipsilateral and one contralateral), and zero microemboli, respectively. By univariate analysis, performing an arch angiogram prior to CAS was associated with a higher risk of microemboli (median microemboli 5 vs none, P =.04)\nAlthough our early experience suggests that CAS may be performed safely (no permanent neurologic deficits following 27 consecutive procedures), cerebral microembolic events occurred in over two-thirds of the procedures despite the uniform use of distal protection. Open carotid surgery in this series seems to offer a lower risk of periprocedural microembolic events detected by DW-MRI.",

Critical ischemia was the indication for most procedures (n = 553, 85%), but 97 (15%) were done for claudication alone. Nearly half (n = 312, 48%) of the patients were diabetic, and 195 (30%) required insulin. All-autogenous vein was used for 389 grafts (60%). Synthetic or composite materials were employed for the remaining 261 grafts, 91 (35%) of which were entirely above the knee. Perioperative data were recorded contemporaneously and were supplemented by reviewing 558 of the 565 medical records and the Social Security Death Index. Survival, graft patency, and limb salvage were analyzed using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier estimates and proportional hazards models.\nDiabetics were more likely to have critical preoperative limb ischemia (P < .001), elevated serum creatinine (P = .003) or a history of previous coronary intervention (P = .015), lower extremity revascularization (P < .001) or minor amputations (P = .002). The operative mortality rate was 4.8%, and there were 81 graft occlusions (12%) and 49 major amputations (7.5%) during the index hospital admission. Patency was immediately restored in 46 of the 81 occluded grafts, but their secondary patency rates were only 62 +/- 16% at 1 year and 26 +/- 18% at 5 years. Insulin-dependent diabetes was associated with a higher incidence of early amputation (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.8; P = .004). Overall survival was 52 +/- 4% at 5 years and 25 +/- 5% at 10 years, and there were 175 late graft occlusions (27%), a total of 198 related reoperations and 107 late amputations (16%). The risks for further occlusion and/or major amputation after three or more graft revisions were 65% and 71%, respectively. Insulin-dependent diabetes also was associated with higher late mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P = .001) and amputation rates (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P = .026), but other independent variables like age, elevated serum creatinine, critical preoperative ischemia, synthetic conduits, and previous ipsilateral bypass had at least as much influence as diabetes on survival, graft failure or limb loss.\nDiabetes was one of several factors influencing survival and limb preservation, but it did not adversely affect graft patency. The number of graft revisions was an important predictor of further occlusion or amputation.",

Miniphlebectomies were also performed. Patients were examined preoperatively and at 12 days, and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Sick leave, time to normal physical activity, pain score, use of analgesics, Aberdeen score, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 quality-of-life score, Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and complication rates were investigated. The total cost of the procedures, including lost wages and equipment, was calculated. Cost calculations were based on the standard fee for HL/S with the addition of laser equipment and the standard salary and productivity level in Denmark.\nA follow-up of 6 months was achieved in 121 patients (137 legs). The groups were well matched for patient and GSV characteristics. Two HL/S procedures failed, and three GSVs recanalized in the EVL group. The groups experienced similar improvement in quality-of-life scores and VCSS score at 3 months. Only one patient in the HL/S group had a major complication, a wound infection that was treated successfully with antibiotics. The HL/S and EVL groups did not differ in mean time to resume normal physical activity (7.7 vs 6.9 calendar days) and work (7.6 vs 7.0 calendar days). Postoperative pain and bruising was higher in the HL/S group, but no difference in the use of analgesics was recorded. The total cost of the procedures, including lost wages, was euro 3084 ($3948 US) in the HL/S and euro 3396 ($4347 US) in the EVL group.\nThis study suggests that the short-term efficacy and safety of EVL and HL/S are similar. Except for slightly increased postoperative pain and bruising in the HL/S group, no differences were found between the two treatment modalities. The treatments were equally safe and efficient in eliminating GSV reflux, alleviating symptoms and signs of GSV varicosities, and improving quality of life. Long-term outcomes, particularly with respect to recurrence rates, shall be investigated in future studies, including the continuation of the present.",

    "abstract": "Outcome data documenting safety for observation of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA 4.0 to 5.4 cm) are lacking outside of large clinical trials but requires near perfect patient compliance. This study describes a clinical pathway for AAA surveillance using a prospective database utilizing a nurse practitioner oversight to provide efficient use of clinic visits while maintaining a high level of patent participation.\nOver a 7-year period (June 1999 through June 2006), 334 patients were enrolled in an AAA surveillance pathway at our academic veterans hospital. To minimize patient travel, clinic visitation was reserved for an initial examination with patient education and for discussion of intervention options in patients demonstrating AAA growth (>5.4 cm or expansion >1 cm/yr) during follow-up. Biannual ultrasound or CT imaging was scheduled and results discussed (after physician review) via telephone or \"same day\" direct patient contact. An electronic database was used to update patient information and plan follow-up.\nCompliance with the AAA surveillance pathway was achieved in 98.5% of patients, with only three patients (0.9%) lost to follow-up and two others (0.6%) choosing early repair at civilian institutions. At a mean interval of 29 months (+/-20 mo), surgical repair was performed in 225 (67%) patients by open (n = 143) or endovascular (n = 82) techniques for AAA growth to >5.4 cm (n = 219) or expansion by >1cm/yr (n = 6). One hundred six patients currently remain in surveillance. A single AAA rupture resulting in death occurred during surveillance (0.3%) and perioperative mortality (<60 days) was 0.9% in patients needing intervention for AAA growth. Cumulative aneurysm-related mortality was 0.9% for patients compliant with the AAA surveillance pathway.\nUse of a prospectively-maintained surveillance database managed by a non-physician provider with a reliance on telephone contact resulted in a high degree of patient compliance, reduced unnecessary patient travel, and provided practical clinic use. Limited additional resources were needed to implement our pathway and a similar approach may prove useful for large volume hospital, clinic, or practice systems.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a nonspecific label. When employing it, one should define the type of TOS as arterial TOS, venous TOS, or neurogenic TOS. Each type has different symptoms and physical findings by which the three types can easily be identified. Neurogenic TOS (NTOS) is by far the most common, comprising well over 90% of all TOS patients. Arterial TOS is the least common accounting for no more than 1%. Many patients are erroneously diagnosed as \"vascular\" TOS, a nonspecific misnomer, whereas they really have NTOS. The Adson Test of noting a radial pulse deficit in provocative positions has been shown to be of no clinical value and should not be relied upon to make the diagnosis of any of the three types. The test is normal in most patients with NTOS and at the same time can be positive in many control volunteers. Arterial TOS is caused by emboli arising from subclavian artery stenosis or aneurysms. Symptoms are those of arterial ischemia and x-rays almost always disclose a cervical rib or anomalous first rib. Venous TOS presents with arm swelling, cyanosis, and pain due to subclavian vein obstruction, with or without thrombosis. Neurogenic TOS is due to brachial plexus compression usually from scarred scalene muscles secondary to neck trauma, whiplash injuries being the most common. Symptoms include extremity paresthesia, pain, and weakness as well as neck pain and occipital headache. Physical exam is most important and includes several provocative maneuvers including neck rotation and head tilting, which elicit symptoms in the contralateral extremity; the upper limb tension test, which is comparable to straight leg raising; and abducting the arms to 90 degrees in external rotation, which usually brings on symptoms within 60 seconds.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews the association between bone and artery disease, with particular relevance to progenitor cells. The review was based on insight gained by analysis of previous publications and on-going work by the authors. A large number of studies have demonstrated a correlation between bone pathology, particularly osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. In this review we highlight the particular aspect of bone marrow progenitor cells in the bone-artery link. Progenitor cells, primarily those believed to give rise to endothelial cells, have been inversely correlated with atherosclerosis severity and risk factors. Therapeutic approaches aimed at manipulating progenitor cells in revascularization and vascular repair have demonstrated some promising results. Subtypes of progenitor cells have also been linked with vascular pathology, however, and further studies are required to assess relative beneficial and pathologic effects of bone marrow-derived progenitors. Further understanding of the link between bone and artery pathophysiology is likely to be of significant value in developing new therapies for vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Injuries of the abdominal visceral vessels are uncommon but devastating entities resulting in extremely high rates of mortality. The most common cause of abdominal vascular injuries is penetrating trauma, accounting for 90% to 95% of these injuries. In contrast, blunt trauma accounts for 5% to 10% of all abdominal vascular lesions. Although traumatic injury to the celiac artery is among the rarest of all vascular injuries, mortality can be as high as 75%. We report a 66-year-old patient who sustained multiple injuries in a motor vehicle crash. The initial whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a combination of severe brain injury and bilateral thoracic lesions. On day 6 after the accident, the patient's clinical situation deteriorated rapidly. At this time, the abdominal arterial CT scan showed a dissection of the celiac artery. Therapeutic anticoagulation was not feasible because of the intracranial hemorrhage. Also the patient's clinical situation worsened so rapidly that interventional therapy, including surgical and endovascular treatment, could not be performed. Finally, the patient died of fulminant hepatic failure, therefore not surviving a potentially treatable injury. The diagnosis of celiac artery dissection in this patient was significantly delayed because the initial trauma CT protocol did not include an arterial phase of the abdominal vessels.",

    "abstract": "Cryoplasty combines mechanical dilatation with the delivery of hypothermia to atherosclerotic plaques. The response of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) to supercooling and subsequent rewarming is still not clear. This study investigated the differential effects of vascular cell survival and proliferation in an in vitro model simulating cryoplasty.\nBovine aortic ECs and SMCs were cultured separately with medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The samples were supercooled to -10 degrees C for 0, 60, or 120 seconds on a cooling stage and then rewarmed in an incubator at 37 degrees C for 0, 6, 12, or 24 hours. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxy uridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation were used to measure the degree of apoptosis and proliferation respectively. Activation of protein kinase B (AKT), P70 S6 kinase, and P44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were assessed by Western blot and quantified using densitometry. Results are given as mean +/- standard error of mean and analyzed by analysis of variance.\nSMC and EC apoptosis were significantly increased with increasing supercooling and rewarming time, with a higher rate in SMCs. SMC apoptosis was maximal at 60 seconds cooling, followed by 24 hours rewarming (17.05% +/- 0.44%), whereas maximal EC apoptosis was after 120 seconds cooling, followed by 24 hours rewarming (4.21% +/- 0.22%, P < .05). Higher AKT activation was observed in ECs, with a maximum obtained of 3.34-fold at 120 seconds cooling with 24 hours rewarming (P < .05); only modest activation was found in SMCs. ECs had a decreased proliferation with cooling and rewarming time, and although SMCs maintained their low proliferative rate, ECs still had a higher overall proliferation rate that was statistically significant at 60 and 120 seconds cooling without rewarming compared with noncooling and nonrewarming (P < .05). Both p70S6 kinase and p44/42 MAPK activities decreased in SMCs, with significant drop at 60 seconds cooling, followed by 12 hours rewarming (P < .05). However, ECs showed a significant rise of P70 S6 kinase activity at 60 seconds cooling with 12 hours rewarming by 1.62-fold and P44/42 MAPK at 120 seconds cooling with 24 hours rewarming by 1.74-fold (P < .05).\nThe higher apoptosis and lower proliferation of SMCs compared with ECs demonstrate the different effects of supercooling and rewarming on different vascular cell types. This information may be important in helping to understand the mechanism by which cryoplasty of atherosclerotic lesions may result in less restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Vascular access dysfunction is a major problem in hemodialysis patients. Only 50% of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) will remain patent 1 year after surgery. AVGs frequently develop stenoses and occlusions at the venous anastomoses in the venous outflow tract. Lumen diameter is not only determined by intimal thickening but is also influenced by remodeling of the vessel wall. Vascular remodeling requires degradation and reorganization of the extracellular matrix by the degradation enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we aimed to provide further insight into the mechanism of endothelial regulation of vascular remodeling and luminal narrowing in AVGs.\nEnd-to-side carotid artery-jugular vein polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were created in 20 domestic swine. The anastomoses and outflow vein were treated with Gelfoam matrices (Pfizer, New York, NY) containing allogeneic porcine aortic endothelial (PAE, n = 10) cells or control matrices without cells (n = 10), and the biologic responses to PAE implants were investigated 3 and 28 days postoperatively. Angiograms before euthanasia were compared with baseline angiograms. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Verhoeff elastin, and antibodies specific to MMP-9 and MMP-2 and underwent histopathologic, morphometric and immunohistochemical analysis.\nVeins treated with PAE cell implants had a 2.8-fold increase in venous lumen diameter compared with baseline (P < .05), a 2.3-fold increase in lumen diameter compared with control, and an 81% decrease in stenosis (P < .05) compared with control at 28 days. The increase in lumen diameter by angiographic analysis correlated with morphometric analysis of tissue sections. PAE implants increased the venous lumen area 2.3-fold (P < .05), decreased venous luminal occlusion 66%, and increased positive venous remodeling 1.9-fold (P < .05) compared with control at 28 days. PAE cell implants reduced MMP-2 expression and neovascularization at 3 and 28 days and adventitial fibrosis at 28 days, suggesting a role of the implants in controlling the affects of medial and adventitial cells in the response to vascular injury.\nThese results demonstrate that the adventitial application of endothelial implants significantly reduced MMP-2 expression within the venous wall, and increased venous lumen diameter and positive remodeling in a porcine arteriovenous graft model. Adventitial endothelial implants may be useful in decreasing luminal narrowing in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Defective mitochondrial function has been reported in patients presenting with peripheral arterial disease, suggesting it might be an important underlying mechanism responsible for increased morbidity and mortality. We therefore determined the effects of prolonged ischemia on energetic skeletal muscle and investigated whether ischemic preconditioning might improve impaired electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation in ischemic skeletal muscle.\nThirty rats were divided in three groups: the control group (sham, n = 9) underwent 5 hours of general anesthesia without any ischemia, the ischemia-reperfusion (IR) group (n = 11) underwent 5 hours ischemia induced by a rubber band tourniquet applied on the left root of the hind limb, and in the third group, preconditioning (PC group, n = 10) was performed just before IR and consisted of three cycles of 10 minutes of ischemia, followed by 10 minutes reperfusion. Maximal oxidative capacities (V(max)) of the gastrocnemius muscle and complexes I, II, and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were determined using glutamate-malate (V(max)), succinate (V(s)), and N, N, N,'N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride ascorbate as substrates.\nPhysiologic characteristics were similar in the three groups. Ischemia reduced V(max) by 43% (4.5 +/- 0.4 vs 7.9 +/- 0.5 micromol O(2)/(min x g dry weight), P < .01) and V(s) by 55% (2.9 +/- 0.3 vs 6.3 +/- 0.4 micromol O(2)/min/g dry weight; P < .01) in the IR and sham groups, respectively, and impairments of mitochondrial complexes I and II activities were evident. Of interest was that preconditioning prevented ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Both V(max) and V(s) were significantly higher in the PC rats than in IR rats (+32% and +41%, respectively; P < .05), and were not different from sham values.\nIschemic preconditioning counteracted ischemia-induced impairments of mitochondrial complexes I and II. These data support that ischemic preconditioning might be an interesting approach to reduce muscular injuries in the setting of ischemic vascular diseases.",

Surgical treatment with resection of the vena cava may be beneficial for selected patients. This study was performed to evaluate our experiences with resection of the vena cava for malignant tumors, with a special focus on secondary tumors involving the inferior caval vein.\nA total of 35 patients underwent extended resection of malignant tumors invading the vena cava. Prosthetic repair was performed in 13 patients by using a ringed polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Preoperative risk factors, mortality and morbidity, and long-term follow-up and graft patency rates were examined.\nThe operative mortality rate was 6%. Minor complications occurred in 12 patients (34%). The graft patency rate was 85%, and there was no graft-related perioperative morbidity. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 76%, 32%, and 21%, respectively, with a median survival of 29 months. Incomplete resection and cardiopulmonary risk have a significant negative effect on survival.\nRadical resection of the vena cava is a feasible procedure in highly selected patients, with low morbidity and mortality and acceptable survival rates, especially in patients with complete resection of the tumor.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the prevalence and distribution of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) to establish a screening protocol to reduce unnecessary venous duplex scanning using different D-dimer level rather than single cutoff point of 0.5 microg/mL in patients with low and moderate pretest clinical probability (PTP).\nThe PTP score and D-dimer testing were used to evaluate 85 consecutive patients with symptomatically proven PE before venous duplex scanning. After calculating the PTP score, patients were divided into low (<or=0 points), moderate (1 to 2 points), and high (>or=3 points) PTP groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was used to determine the appropriate D-dimer cutoff point in low and moderate PTP, with a negative predictive value of >98%.\nThe study enrolled 81 patients. The prevalence of DVT was 63%, with 27 patients (33%) classified as low, 38 (47%) as moderate, and 16 (20%) as high PTP. DVT was detected in nine patients (33%) in the low PTP group, in 27 (71%) in the moderate group, and in 15 (94%) in the high group. In the low PTP patients, the difference in the value of D-dimer assay between positive-scan and negative-scan patients was statistically significant (9.99 +/- 7.33 vs 3.46 +/- 4.20, respectively; P = .008). Conversely, no significant difference in the D-dimer assay value between positive and negative scan results was found in the moderate PTP patients. ROC curves analysis were used to select D-dimer cutoff points of 2.0 microg/mL for the low PTP group and 0.7 microg/mL for the moderate PTP groups. For both groups, D-dimer testing provided 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value in the diagnosis of DVT. In the low PTP group, specificity increased from 33% to 67% (P = .046). In the moderate PTP group, however, the determined D-dimer level did not improve the specificity. Overall, venous duplex scanning could have been reduced by 17% (14/81) by using different D-dimer cutoff points.\nA combination of specific D-dimer level and clinical probability score is most effective in the low PTP patients in excluding DVT. In the moderate PTP group, however, the recommended cutoff point of 0.5 microg/mL may be preferable. These results show that a different D-dimer level is more useful than single cutoff point of 0.5 microg/mL in excluding DVT in established PE patients.",

    "abstract": "The deep veins (DV) of the thigh have proven to be versatile autogenous conduits for arterial reconstruction. Harvesting DV poses a theoretical risk of compromising venous outflow of the limb, which could predispose to chronic venous morbidity. The purpose of this study was to define the late incidence of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and to characterize the long-term alterations in venous physiology after DV harvest.\nSince 1991, 269 patients have undergone arterial reconstructions using DV at our facility. Patients with DV harvest at least 43 months prior to the study (n = 151) were eligible for inclusion. Eighty-nine patients were excluded (deceased = 70; lost to follow-up = 19). Forty-six patients who declined formal testing were queried by phone for signs and symptoms of CVI. The current study presents a case-control series of 16 patients (27 limbs) after DV harvest and six age- and gender-matched control patients (12 limbs) who underwent examination and venous testing.\nAt a mean follow-up of 70.1 +/- 5.6 months, 23 of 27 limbs (85.2%) had no significant CVI (CEAP C(0) to C(2)). Four limbs (14.8%) had significant venous morbidity (C(3) to C(6)), including edema alone (C(3); n = 2 limbs), edema with skin changes (C(4); n = 1 limb), and a healed venous ulceration (C(5); n = 1 limb). APG testing confirmed relative venous outflow obstruction after DV harvest (mean outflow fraction: harvested limbs = 38.4 +/- 3.9% vs control limbs = 51.7 +/- 4.3%; P = .04). Despite the relative outflow obstruction, the mean VFI was not significantly different between harvested and control limbs (harvested limbs = 1.08 +/- 0.15% vs control limbs = 0.77 +/- 0.16%; P = .19). DV harvest resulted in no significant changes in calf ejection fraction (harvested limbs = 67.4 +/- 6.4% vs control limbs = 86.8 +/- 9.5%; P = .09) or residual volume fraction measured (harvested limbs = 32.3 +/- 6.4% vs control limbs = 47.7 +/- 11.6%; P = .22). Of the 46 patients interviewed by phone, five (10.9%) reported bilateral amputations, seven (15.2%) reported chronic edema in their harvested limbs (C(3)), and 34 (73.9%) reported no signs of CVI in their harvested limbs (C(0)).\nDeep vein harvest produces few symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency, and venous ulceration is infrequent. Despite relative venous outflow obstruction, noninvasive indices of chronic venous insufficiency on APG are often normal, suggesting that the risk of developing venous ulceration is low in the majority of patients after DV harvest.",

DV harvest resulted in no significant changes in calf ejection fraction (harvested limbs = 67.4 +/- 6.4% vs control limbs = 86.8 +/- 9.5%; P = .09) or residual volume fraction measured (harvested limbs = 32.3 +/- 6.4% vs control limbs = 47.7 +/- 11.6%; P = .22). Of the 46 patients interviewed by phone, five (10.9%) reported bilateral amputations, seven (15.2%) reported chronic edema in their harvested limbs (C(3)), and 34 (73.9%) reported no signs of CVI in their harvested limbs (C(0)).",

    "abstract": "Claudication is the most common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), producing significant ambulatory compromise. The gait of claudicating patients has been evaluated using primarily temporal and spatial parameters. With the present study, we used advanced biomechanical measures to further delineate the ambulatory impairment of claudicating patients. We hypothesized that the claudicating legs of PAD patients have an altered kinetic gait pattern compared with normal legs from control subjects.\nAmbulation kinetics (ground reaction forces) were evaluated in claudicating patients and compared with age-matched healthy controls. Forces were analyzed in the vertical, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral directions. Time from heel touch-down to toe-off (stance time) and time spent in double-limb support were also evaluated.\nThe study recruited 14 PAD patients (age, 58 +/- 3.4 years; weight, 80.99 +/- 15.64 kg) with femoropopliteal occlusive disease (ankle-brachial index [ABI], 0.56 +/- 0.03) and five controls (age, 53 +/- 3.4 years; weight, 87.38 +/- 12.75 kg; ABI, >or=1.00). Vertical force curve evaluation demonstrated significant flattening in claudicating patients resulting in a lower and less fluctuant center of mass when ambulating. In the anterior-posterior direction, claudicating patients demonstrated significantly decreased propulsion forces. In the medial-lateral direction, they had significantly increased forces consistent with wider steps and an inability to swing their legs straight through. Claudicating patients demonstrated a greater stance time and time in double limb support compared with healthy controls. Most importantly, gait abnormalities were present before the onset of claudication, with gait worsening after the onset of claudication.\nClaudicating patients demonstrate significant gait impairments that are present even before they experience any limb discomfort. These alterations may make them feel more stable and secure while attempting to minimize use of the affected limb. Advanced biomechanical analysis, using ambulation kinetics, permits objective and quantitative evaluation of the gaits of claudicating patients. Such evaluation may point to new rehabilitation strategies and provide objective measurement of functional outcomes after medical and surgical therapy.",

    "abstract": "Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have increased mortality from cardiovascular events compared with age and sex matched controls Platelets play a major role in atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular events. Platelet reactivity is increased in patients with PAD compared with healthy controls. We aimed to determine the relationship, if any, between platelet activation and severity of disease.\nOne hundred eighty-two patients with intermittent claudication (IC) or subcritical limb ischemia (SLI), defined as the presence of rest pain or ulceration, had the following investigations performed: platelet P-selectin expression and bound fibrinogen by flow cytometric analysis and platelet aggregation using the rapid platelet function assay with arachidonic acid (AA) and thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP) as agonists. Patients with SLI compared with IC had significantly enhanced ADP stimulated P-selectin expression (median 42.45% [inter-quartile range 33.32% to 58.5%] vs 35.2% [26.07% to 46.32%], P = .002) and bound fibrinogen (73.7% [54.3% to 83.2%] vs 63.7% [43.8% to 76.5%], P = .001). TRAP stimulated aggregation was higher (207 [153 to 238] PAU vs 183[155 to 199] PAU, P = .04) but AA mediated aggregation was not significantly different. An ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) of less than 0.6 was associated with increased ADP stimulated P-selectin and bound fibrinogen (P < .05). ABPI correlated inversely with ADP stimulated P-selectin expression (r = -0.228, P = .003), ADP stimulated fibrinogen binding (r = -0.156, P = .043) and TRAP stimulated aggregation (r = -0.179, P = .04).\nWe have demonstrated for the first time that progression of severity of PAD is not only reflected by symptoms, signs, and ABPI but also by increased platelet activity as assessed by both flow cytometry and aggregation. As patients with more severe PAD have increased cardiovascular mortality, our findings suggest that new strategies for platelet inhibitory therapy are indicated in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular procedures have become an integral part of a vascular surgeon's practice. The exposure of surgeons to ionizing radiation and other safety issues have not been well studied. We investigated the radiation exposure of a team of vascular surgeons in an active endovascular unit and compared yearly dosages absorbed by various body parts among different surgeons. Patients' radiation exposure was also assessed.\nThe radiation absorption of a team of vascular surgeons was prospectively monitored in a 12-month period. During each endovascular procedure, the effective body, eye, and hand radiation doses of all participating surgeons were measured by mini-thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) attached at the chest level under a lead apron, at the forehead at eye level, and at the hand. The type of procedure, fluoroscopy machine, fluoroscopy time, and personal and operating theatre radiation protection devices used in each procedure were also recorded. One TLD was attached to the patient's body near the operative site to measure the patient's dose. The yearly effective body, eye, and hand dose were compared with the safety limits of radiation for occupational exposure recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP). The radiation absorption of various body parts per minute of fluoroscopy was compared among different surgeons.\nA total of 149 consecutive endovascular procedures were performed, including 30 endovascular aortic repairs (EVAR), 58 arteriograms with and without embolization (AGM), and 61 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent (PTA/S) procedures. The cumulative fluoroscopy time was 1132 minutes. The median yearly effective body, eye, and hand dose for the surgeons were 0.20 mSv (range, 0.13 to 0.27 mSv), 0.19 mSv (range, 0.10 to 0.33 mSv) and 0.99 mSv (0.29 to 1.84 mSv) respectively, which were well below the safety limits of the ICRP. The mean body, eye, and hand dose of the chief surgeon per procedure were highest for EVAR. A significant discrepancy was observed for the average hand dose per minute of fluoroscopy among different surgeons. The mean radiation absorption of patients who underwent EVAR, AGM, and PTA/S was 12.7 mSv, 13.6 mSv, and 3.4 mSv, respectively.\nWith current radiation protection practice, the radiation absorbed by vascular surgeons with a high endovascular workload did not exceed the safety limits recommended by ICRP. Variations in practice, however, can result in significant discrepancy of radiation absorption between surgeons.",

Although few patients have clinically evident neurologic deficit, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) presents a number of cases with ischemic brain lesions. This study should elucidate preoperative risk factors for perioperative microemboli that cause brain infarction.\nWe studied 183 patients (58 women, 69.2 +/-12.7 years; 125 men, 69.3 +/- 8.9 years) with high-degree carotid artery stenosis. DWI was performed before and after CEA to analyze new cerebral ischemia. Blood samples were obtained before operation to measure fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP), and preoperative high-sensitive CRP (hsCRP) was analyzed in 30 consecutive patients.\nPostoperative DWI revealed new ipsilateral ischemic lesions in 41 patients (22.4%), and eight (4.4%) showed new neurologic deficit. Preoperative fibrinogen levels were higher in patients with new lesions (397.6 mg/dL +/- 104.7 mg/dL) than in those without (324.7 mg/dL +/- 74.2 mg/dL, P < .001). Preoperative levels of hsCRP were also higher in patients with new lesions (7.9 mg/dL +/- 5.2 mg/dL) than in those without (2.8 mg/dL +/- 2.6 mg/dL, P = .004). Significant association was found between fibrinogen and CRP (Spearman rho = 0.402; P < .001) as well as hsCRP (Spearman rho = 0.603, P = .003). No association was found between postoperative lesions and CRP (P = .833).\nThe present study demonstrates that preoperative levels of fibrinogen and hsCRP are independent determinants for new periprocedural cerebral ischemic lesions caused by microembolic events. There is still not sufficient evidence to recommend measurement of CRP as a prognostic marker for perioperative cerebral lesion.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to discuss the incidence, diagnosis, and management of stent graft infections after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nData were collected from the hospital database and medical case notes for all patients with infected endografts after elective or emergency EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) during the last 8 years in two university teaching hospitals in Northern Ireland. The data included the patient's age, gender, presentation of sepsis, treatment offered, and the ultimate outcome. The diagnosis of graft-related sepsis was established by a combination of investigations including inflammatory markers, labelled white cell scan, computed tomography (CT) scan, microbiology cultures, and postmortem examination.\nGraft-related septic complications occurred in six of 509 patients, including 433 elective repairs and 76 emergency endografts for ruptured AAA. Two patients presented with left psoas abscess and were treated successfully with extra-anatomic bypass and removal of the infected stent graft. Two more patients presented with infected graft without other evidence of intra-abdominal sepsis: one underwent successful removal of the infected prosthesis with extra-anatomical bypass, and the other was treated conservatively and died of progressively worsening sepsis. The fifth patient presented with unexplained fever and died suddenly, with a postmortem diagnosis of aortoenteric fistula and ruptured aneurysm. The last patient presented with an aortoenteric fistula, was treated conservatively in view of concurrent myelodysplasia, and died of possible aneurysm rupture.\nThis report emphasizes the need for continued awareness of potential graft-related septic complications in patients undergoing EVAR of AAA. Attention to detail with regard to sterility and antibiotic prophylaxis during stent grafting and during any secondary interventions is vital in reducing the risk of infection. In addition, early recognition and prompt treatment are essential for a successful outcome.",

    "abstract": "It has long been evident that lifetime follow-up after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is necessary to identify late complications. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that late follow-up rates for EVAR in routine practice are inferior to those reported from protocol-driven clinical trials, consequently contributing to avoidable events associated with poor long-term outcome.\nFrom February 1999 to December 2005, 302 EVARs were performed and eligible for follow-up. Of these, 47 were performed as part of an industry-sponsored clinical trial (study patients). Responsibility for follow-up was assigned to a research nurse for study patients and to office clerical staff for nonstudy patients. Follow-up compliance was classified as either frequent (<1 missed scheduled appointment) or incomplete (>2 missed scheduled appointments). Overall survival and complication rates were analyzed.\nOf the 302 patients, 203 (67.2%) had frequent follow-up and 99 (32.8%) had incomplete follow-up. The mean follow-up was significantly better in the frequent follow-up group (34.7 +/- 22 months) vs the incomplete follow-up group (18.8 +/- 18.6 months, P < .001). The 5-year survival (63.9% frequent vs 64.0% incomplete), the 5-year reintervention rate (22.3% frequent vs 10.8% incomplete), and incidence of known endoleak (14.8% frequent vs 9.1% incomplete) were statistically similar in the two groups. The incidence of major adverse events, defined as events requiring urgent surgical intervention, was significantly increased in the incomplete follow-up group (6.1% vs 0.5%; P = .006), with nearly half of these patients dying perioperatively. There was no difference in measured outcomes for study patients compared with nonstudy patients. However, mean follow-up was significantly longer for study patients vs nonstudy patients (44.8 +/- 23.7 months vs 26.8 +/- 20.9 months; P < .001).\nFollow-up surveillance after EVAR is less intense in practice environments outside of clinical trials. Patients with incomplete follow-up have higher fatal complication rates than patients with frequent follow-up. These data expose a potential under-appreciated limitation of EVAR, questioning whether the findings in clinical trials defining the efficacy of EVAR can be routinely extrapolated to ordinary practice.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine use can result in a variety of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction, arterial thrombosis, coronary dissection, and cardiomyopathy. Cocaine-induced aortic dissection is uncommon and has been described largely in case reports. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with aortic dissection associated with cocaine abuse.\nA retrospective chart review was performed of all hospital records during a 15-year period in patients diagnosed with aortic dissection. Among the 164 cases of acute aortic dissection, 16 patients (9.8%) had used cocaine or its derivative, crack cocaine, within 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. The remaining 148 patients (90.2%) had no history of cocaine usage. Clinical features, management, and outcome in these two groups were compared.\nIn the cocaine group, powder cocaine was inhaled intranasally in 11 patients (69%) and crack cocaine was smoked in five cases (31%). The mean duration between cocaine use and the onset of aortic dissection was 12.8 hours (range, 4 to 24 hours). Patients in the cocaine group were younger in age and more likely to have a history of polysubstance abuse than the non-cocaine cohort. In the cocaine group, the incidence of DeBakey dissection type I, II, IIIa, and IIIb was 19%, 25%, 38%, and 19%, respectively. In the group without cocaine use, the incidence of DeBakey dissection type I, II, IIIa, and IIIb was 18%, 23%, 39%, and 20%, respectively. Surgical intervention for aortic dissection was performed in 50% of the cocaine group and 45% of the non-cocaine group. In patients who underwent surgical repair, greater pulmonary complications occurred in the cocaine group than the non-cocaine group (n = 0.02). No difference was noted in the hospital length of stay or 30-day operative mortality among the two groups.\nCocaine-associated aortic dissection occurs in predominantly male patients with illicit drug abuse who were younger than patients with aortic dissection without cocaine use. Greater pulmonary complications can occur in patients with cocaine-related aortic dissection following surgical interventions.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate our experience of thoracic endoluminal graft (ELG) repair of various thoracic aortic pathologies using a commercially available device approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Our patient population includes patients eligible for open surgical repair and those with prohibitive surgical risk.\nFrom March 1998 to March 2006, endovascular stent repair of the thoracic aorta was performed on 406 patients with 324 patients (median age 72; 200 male) receiving the Gore Excluder endograft. Patient demographics, procedural characteristics, complications, including endoleak, spinal cord ischemia, and mortality, were retrospectively reviewed during follow-up. All patients were followed with chest computer tomography at 6 months and yearly. Statistical analysis was performed utilizing the SPSS Windows 11.0 program. Logistic regression (univariate) analysis used to identify risk factors for paraplegia; analysis of variance (ANOVA) for endoleak distribution; and chi(2) used to analyze variables. Survival analysis was done using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nThree hundred twenty-four patients were treated with Gore Excluder graft between March 1998 and March 2006. One hundred fifty-seven patients (48.5%) had atherosclerotic aneurysms, 82 (25.3%) had dissections type B (DTB), 34 (10.5%) had penetrating ulcers (PU), 26 (8.0%) with pseudoaneurysms (PSA), 11 (3.4%) had transections (MVAT), 9 (2.8%) aorto-bronchial fistulas (AoBF), 4 (1.2%) embolization, and 1 (0.3%) aorto-esophageal fistula (AoEF). Preoperative aneurysm sac size in TAA ranged from 5 to 12 centimeters, average size 6.3 cm. Sac shrinkage occurred in 65% (102 of 157) of patients. Average postoperative sac size of 5.4 cm in a mean follow-up of 20.4 months. One hundred cases (31.5%) were nonelective; 49 (15.1%) were ruptures. Overall complication was 22.7%, 14.2% (46) in elective cases and 8.5% (28) in nonelective cases. Paraplegia occurred in five (1.5%) patients and paresis in three (0.9%); two of the latter improved and one resolved completely prior to discharge. Incidence of paraplegia was statistically significant (P value < .05) with retroperitoneal approach, perioperative blood loss greater than 1000 cc, and aortic coverage greater than 40 cm. Early endoleaks included 18 (5.5%) type I, four (1.2%) type II, and two (0.6%) type III. Thirty-day mortality was 5.5% (18 related deaths, including three intraoperative deaths). A log rank test did not find statistical differences in actuarial survival with 30-day related mortality between TAA and other pathologies (P = .29) or between DTB and other pathologies (P = .97). Late mortality was 9.6% with 31 unrelated deaths. Follow-up ranged between 1 month and 70 months, average 17 months.\nEndoluminal grafting is a feasible alternative to open surgical repair for thoracic aortic pathologies. After more than 300 cases, 30-day morbidity and mortality compares favorably with open repair. Paraplegia remains low as a complication and increases in incidence with retroperitoneal approach, increased perioperative blood loss, and increased aortic coverage.",

    "abstract": "Although muscular calf vein thrombosis (MCVT) is commonly seen in everyday practice, no treatment guidelines are available. This study evaluated short-term and mid-term outcome of isolated symptomatic MCVT.\nWe included prospectively and consecutively all patients referred to an outpatient clinic with isolated MCVT. Clinical signs were pain or edema, or both, of the calf. Diagnosis was established with duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination. Not completely occlusive and asymptomatic MCVTs were excluded. Patients were followed up clinically and with DUS at 1, 3, and 9 months, and up to 36 months. Anticoagulant therapy at curative dosage associated with compression was prescribed for 1 month and was extended for 2 additional months in case of incomplete recanalization at 1 month or if risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) were present.\nIncluded were 128 patients (78 women, 50 men) presenting with 131 MCVTs. Their mean age was 57.02 +/- 15.36 years (range, 20 to 87 years). Thrombus was present in the soleal veins (SoV) in 73 patients (55.7%) and in the medial gastrocnemius veins (MGV) in 58 (44.3%). Initial symptoms were isolated pain in the calf in 90 patients, isolated edema of the calf in six, and pain plus edema in 32. Anticoagulant therapy was prescribed in 53 patients (41.4%) for 1 month, in 59 (46.1%) for 3 months, and in 13 (10.2%) for >or=6 months. At baseline, nine pulmonary embolisms (7%), complicated with MCVT, were observed in six MGV patients (10.3%) and three SoV patients (4.1%; P = .18). Two nonfatal hemorrhagic events occurred. Three patients died during the follow-up after anticoagulant therapy had been discontinued. Recanalization of MCVT was considered complete at 1, 3, and 9 months in 54.8%, 84.7%, and 96% of cases, respectively, with no significant difference between the MGV and the SoV groups. Twenty-nine VTE symptomatic recurrences (PE, n = 6; DVT including MCVT, n = 23) were observed in 24 patients (18.8%), with similar figures in both thrombosis groups: none at 3 months, 11 between 3 and 9 months and 18 between 9 and 36 months. No extension of the MCVT or a recurrence of VTE was observed in patients treated with anticoagulant therapy. Twelve cases of superficial thrombophlebitis occurred during the follow-up period.\nThis study confirms the place of MCVT in VTE disorders. Pulmonary embolism at the MCVT initial diagnosis was not rare, and mid-term follow-up (mean, 26.7 months) revealed that 18.8% of patients had at least one VTE recurrence. The treatment of acute MCVT needs to be standardized because no guidelines currently exist.",

Initial symptoms were isolated pain in the calf in 90 patients, isolated edema of the calf in six, and pain plus edema in 32. Anticoagulant therapy was prescribed in 53 patients (41.4%) for 1 month, in 59 (46.1%) for 3 months, and in 13 (10.2%) for >or=6 months. At baseline, nine pulmonary embolisms (7%), complicated with MCVT, were observed in six MGV patients (10.3%) and three SoV patients (4.1%; P = .18). Two nonfatal hemorrhagic events occurred. Three patients died during the follow-up after anticoagulant therapy had been discontinued. Recanalization of MCVT was considered complete at 1, 3, and 9 months in 54.8%, 84.7%, and 96% of cases, respectively, with no significant difference between the MGV and the SoV groups. Twenty-nine VTE symptomatic recurrences (PE, n = 6; DVT including MCVT, n = 23) were observed in 24 patients (18.8%), with similar figures in both thrombosis groups: none at 3 months, 11 between 3 and 9 months and 18 between 9 and 36 months. No extension of the MCVT or a recurrence of VTE was observed in patients treated with anticoagulant therapy. Twelve cases of superficial thrombophlebitis occurred during the follow-up period.",

The main outcome was HRQOL at 1-year follow-up.\nHRQOL improved between baseline and follow-up, and invasive treatment led to significant improvements in the subscales Physical Functioning (P = .005) and Pain (P = .003). Type D patients were severely impaired in their HRQOL compared with other patients at baseline (P < .01) and at follow-up (P < .05). ABI and ACD also predicted HRQOL at follow-up.

High-grade stenosis (peak systolic velocity [PSV] >300 cm/s, diastolic velocity >125 cm/s, internal carotid artery stent/proximal common carotid artery ratio >4) involving the stented arterial segment prompted diagnostic angiography and repair when >75% diameter-reduction stenosis was confirmed. Criteria for >50% CAS stenosis was a PSV >150 cm/s with a PSV stent ratio >2.\nAll 114 carotid stents were patent on initial DUS imaging, including 90 (79%) with PSV <150 cm/s (94 +/- 24 cm/s), 23 (20%) with PSV >150 cm/s (183 +/- 34 cm/s), and one with high-grade, residual stenosis (PSV = 355). During subsequent surveillance, 81 CAS sites (71%) exhibited no change in stenosis severity, nine sites demonstrated stenosis regression to <50% diameter reduction, and five sites developed velocity spectra of a high-grade stenosis. Angiography confirmed >75% diameter reduction in all six CASs with DUS-detected high-grade stenosis, all patients were asymptomatic, and treatment consisted of endovascular (n = 5) or surgical (n = 1) repair. During the mean 33-month follow-up period, three patients experienced ipsilateral, reversible neurologic events at 30, 45, and 120 days after CAS; none was associated with severe stent stenosis. No stent occlusions occurred, and no patient with >50% CAS stenosis on initial or subsequent testing developed a permanent ipsilateral permanent neurologic deficit or stroke-related death.\nDUS surveillance after CAS identified a 5% procedural failure rate due to the development of high-grade in-stent stenosis. Both progression and regression of stent stenosis severity was observed on serial testing, but 70% of CAS sites demonstrated velocity spectra consistent with <50% diameter reduction. The surveillance algorithm used, including reintervention for asymptomatic high-grade CAS stenosis, was associated with stent patency and the absence of disabling stroke.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality due in part to its diagnostic difficulty and operative challenges. The purpose of this study was to review our experience of surgical management in patients with this condition and to identify variables associated with adverse outcomes following surgical interventions.\nHospital records and clinical data of all patients undergoing surgical interventions for AMI were reviewed during a recent 12-year period. Clinical outcomes as well as factors influencing mortality were analyzed.\nA total of 72 patients (41 females, overall mean age 65 years, range 34 to 83 years) were included in the study. Thrombosis and embolism were the cause of AMI in 48 patients (67%) and 24 patients (33%), respectively. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom (96%), followed by nausea (56%). Preoperative angiogram was performed in 61 patients (85%). All patients underwent operative interventions, which included thromboembolectomy (n = 22, 31%), mesenteric bypass grafting (n = 33, 46%), patch angioplasty (n = 9, 12%), reimplantation (n = 5, 7%), and endarterectomy (n = 3, 4%). Bowel resection was necessary in 22 patients (31%) during the initial operation, and second-look operation was performed in 38 patients (53%). Perioperative morbidity and 30-day mortality rates were 39% and 31%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed renal insufficiency (P < .02), age >70 (P < .001), metabolic acidosis (P < .02), and symptom duration (P < .005), and bowel resection in second-look operations (P < .01) were associated with mortality. Logistic regression analysis showed age >70 (P = .03) and prolonged symptom duration (P = .02) were independent predictors of mortality.\nElderly patients and those with a prolonged duration of symptoms had worse outcomes following surgical intervention for AMI. A high index of suspicion with prompt diagnostic evaluation may reduce time delay prior to surgical intervention, which may lead to improved patient survival. Aggressive surgical intervention should be performed as promptly as possible in patients once the diagnosis of AMI is made.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective review describes the use and clinical outcome of cold perfusion protection during branch renal artery (RA) repair in 77 consecutive patients.\nFrom July 1987 through November 2006, 874 patients had open operative RA repair to 1312 kidneys. Seventy-seven patients (62 women, 15 men; mean age, 44 +/- 17 years) had branch RA reconstruction using ex vivo or in situ cold perfusion protection for 78 kidneys. Demographic data and surgical technique were examined. Blood pressure response and renal function were estimated. Patency of repair was determined by angiography and renal duplex ultrasound (RDUS) imaging. Primary RA patency was estimated by life-table methods.\nSeventy-eight RAs were repaired using ex vivo (49 kidneys) or in situ (29 kidneys) cold perfusion protection. Bilateral RA repair was performed in eight patients, with 13 repairs to solitary kidneys. RA disease included aneurysm (RAA) in 50, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in 37, atherosclerosis in 5, and arteritis in 2; 16 patients had both FMD and RAA. Hypertension was present in 93.5% (mean blood pressure, 184 +/- 35/107 +/- 19 mm Hg; mean of 1.9 +/- 1.1 drugs). RA repair included bypass using saphenous vein in 69, hypogastric artery in 3, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 2, composite vein/PTFE in 2, cephalic vein in 1, or aneurysmorrhaphy in 1. The eight bilateral RA repairs were staged. One patient required bilateral cold perfusion protection. One planned nephrectomy was performed at the time of contralateral ex vivo reconstruction. No primary nephrectomies were required for intended reconstruction. Each RA reconstruction required branch dissection and reconstruction (mean of 2.8 +/- 1.6 branches were repaired). Mean cold ischemia time was 125 +/- 40 minutes. Each kidney was reconstructed in an orthotopic fashion. Five early failures of repair required three nephrectomies and one operative revision. Based on postoperative angiography or RDUS, or both, primary patency of RA repair at 12 months was 85% +/- 5%; assisted primary patency was 93% +/- 4%. Among patients with preoperative hypertension, 15% were cured, 65% were improved, and 20% were considered failed. Early renal function was improved in 35%, unchanged in 48%, and worse in 17%. Four patients had perioperative acute tubular necrosis. No patient progressed to dialysis-dependence.\nBoth ex vivo and in situ cold perfusion protection extend the safe renal ischemia time for complex branch RA repair and avoid the need for nephrectomy.",

    "abstract": "In some community-based studies, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) has been shown to be independently predictive of future fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We tested the hypothesis that Lp-PLA(2) is independently predictive of mortality in high-risk patients from a vascular laboratory.\nBetween 1990 and 1994, patients seen in the previous 10 years for noninvasive lower extremity arterial testing were invited to return for a vascular examination of the lower extremities. By medical record review, we identified 2265 eligible patients; of these, 508 returned for interviews, blood collection, and arterial examination and represent those who had survived, could be located, and were willing to participate. The 508 subjects were followed up for an average of 6.7 years until the end of the study period on December 31, 2001. Vital status was ascertained by multiple searches of the Social Security Death Index. The primary outcomes for this study were time to any, CVD, and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality.\nThe mean age was 68.2 years, 88% were men, 87% were non-Hispanic white, 39.1% were diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease only, 9.2% with other CVD only, and 28.5% with both peripheral arterial disease and other CVD. During the entire follow-up period, 299 (59.7%) patients died, 167 from CVD, of which 88 deaths were due to coronary heart disease. With adjustment for CVD risk factors and baseline peripheral arterial disease and other CVD, an increment of one standard deviation in Lp-PLA(2) activity was associated with a 40% higher risk for CHD mortality at 5 years of follow-up (P = .04). Additional adjustment for triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduced this association to nonsignificance (hazard risk, 1.12).\nIn a vascular laboratory patient population, higher levels of LpPLA(2) mass and activity were not significantly associated with total, CVD, or CHD mortality at 5 years of follow-up and after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors and the presence of PAD and other CVD at baseline. An apparent elevated risk of CHD death associated with elevated Lp-PLA2 was largely explained by associated elevations in lipids and lipoproteins.",

During the entire follow-up period, 299 (59.7%) patients died, 167 from CVD, of which 88 deaths were due to coronary heart disease. With adjustment for CVD risk factors and baseline peripheral arterial disease and other CVD, an increment of one standard deviation in Lp-PLA(2) activity was associated with a 40% higher risk for CHD mortality at 5 years of follow-up (P = .04). Additional adjustment for triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduced this association to nonsignificance (hazard risk, 1.12).",

The purpose of this study is to review the spectrum, management, and clinical outcome of patients with vascular abnormalities and NF-I.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 31 patients (15 males, 16 females) with clinical NF-I and vascular abnormalities identified from imaging or operative findings between 1976 and 2005.\nThe diagnosis of NF-I was made at a mean age of 11 +/- 10 years with vascular lesions identified at a mean age of 38 +/- 16 years. There were 76 vascular abnormalities, including 38 aneurysms, 20 arterial stenoses, 5 arteriovenous malformations (AVM), 5 arteries compressed or invaded by neural tumors, and 6 abnormalities of the heart valves. Arterial lesions were located in the aorta (n = 17) and in the renal (n = 12), mesenteric (n = 12), carotid-vertebral (n = 10), intracerebral (n = 4), and subclavian-axillary and iliofemoral arteries (3 each). Interventions were required in 23 patients (74%); 15 underwent 24 arterial reconstructions, including 9 renal, 8 aortic, 4 mesenteric, 2 carotid, and 1 femoral. The other eight patients had excision of AVM in three, vessel ligation in two, and clipping of cerebral aneurysms, coil embolization of hepatic aneurysms, and left thoracotomy in one patient each. One patient died of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Six patients (26%) had postoperative complications, including pneumonia in two, and stroke, acalculous cholecystitis, brachial plexopathy and chylothorax in one patient each. The median follow up was 4.1 years (range, 6 months to 20 years). Late vascular problems developed in three patients, including graft stenoses in two and rupture of another aortic aneurysm in one. Freedom from graft-related complications was 83% at 10 years. Patient survival at 10 years was 77%, less than the 86% expected survival for the general population (P < .001).\nPatients with NF-I have a wide spectrum of vascular abnormalities, most notably aneurysms or stenoses of the aortic, renal, and mesenteric circulation. Operative treatment of symptomatic patients with vascular lesions or large aneurysms is safe, effective, and durable.",

    "abstract": "To describe a novel technique for maximal reimplantation of intercostal arteries during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nEight patients underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair with this new technique from 2005 to 2006. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 14 months. All patients had a previous type B dissection with subsequent aneurysmal degeneration into an extent I TAAA. Aneurysm repair was performed through a thoracoabdominal incision and circulatory arrest in seven and left atrial-left femoral (LA-FA) bypass in one. The grafts extended from the distal arch at the subclavian artery to the visceral and renal arteries. An 8 mm graft was then extended from the proximal to the distal graft with a spatulation of the graft allowing a side-to-side anastomosis of the graft to the posterior aortic wall incorporating multiple pairs of intercostal arteries. Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were monitored during each operation.\nAll patients were ambulatory at the time of admission. One patient had suffered a previous spinal cord infarction from the original dissection and had residual unilateral leg weakness prior to the TAAA repair. There was an average of seven pairs of patent intercostal arteries upon opening the aorta. We reimplanted an average of five pairs of vessels. There were no perioperative complications. No patients sustained transient or permanent paraplegia in the postoperative or follow-up period. The one patient with preoperative leg weakness had reported subjective increased strength in the affected leg after the operation. In four cases, normalization of SSEP waveforms did not occur until after reimplantation of the intercostal arteries despite full return of EEG waveforms, restoration of lower extremity perfusion, and rewarming of the patient. Follow-up CT scan angiogram demonstrated that all reconstructions were patent through the follow-up period.\nParaplegia is an extremely morbid complication associated with TAAA repair. We describe a technique that allows reimplantation of almost all intercostal arteries as one patch circumventing the need for selective reimplantation. Furthermore, our technique ensures continued patency of this patch graft as the outflow resistance is decreased by creating a continuous flow loop. Although this is a small case series, we had no incidence of acute or delayed paraplegia in this high risk group. Our technique of intercostal reimplantation is applicable to all open TAAA repair at high-risk for paraplegia and may be an important adjunct in preventing spinal cord ischemia.",

    "abstract": "A regional cooperative data registry was organized for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), lower extremity bypass (LEB), and infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (open and endovascular) procedures in Northern New England to allow benchmarking among centers for quality assurance and improvement activities.\nSince January 2003, 48 vascular surgeons from nine hospitals in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (25 to 615 beds) have prospectively recorded patient, procedure, and in-hospital patient outcome data. Results plus 1-year follow-up data analyzed at a central site are reported anonymously to each center at semiannual meetings where care processes and regional benchmarks are discussed. Mortality and compliance with procedure entry were validated by independent comparison with hospital administrative data. Initial improvement efforts focused on optimizing preoperative medication usage.\nA total of 6143 operations were entered into the registry through December 2006. In-hospital stroke or death after CEA was 1.0%, major amputation or death after LEB was 3.8%, and mortality was 2.9% after elective open and 0.4% after endovascular repair. Variation in results between centers and surgeons provides opportunity for further quality improvement. Any postoperative complication increased median length of stay by > or =3 days. Process improvement efforts initiated in 2004 increased preoperative beta-blocker administration from 72% to 91%, antiplatelet agents from 73% to 83%, and statins from 54% to 72% (all P < .001). Procedure volume and discharge status validation with administrative data led to 99% of appropriate operations being reported to the registry. Mortality was accurately reported to the data registry for all patients.\nThis validated regional data registry within a quality improvement initiative has been associated with improved preoperative medication usage. It provides a potential vehicle for future public and pay-for-performance reporting and has the potential to improve patient outcomes.

Process improvement efforts initiated in 2004 increased preoperative beta-blocker administration from 72% to 91%, antiplatelet agents from 73% to 83%, and statins from 54% to 72% (all P < .001). Procedure volume and discharge status validation with administrative data led to 99% of appropriate operations being reported to the registry.

    "abstract": "Ocular symptoms and signs often herald hemispheric neurological events associated with extracranial cerebrovascular disease. However, the presence of a Hollenhorst plaque (HP) or retinal artery occlusion (RAO) and the risk of stroke is unclear. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of all patients who presented with a HP or RAO at a single institution.\nBetween 2000 and 2005, the management and outcome of 130 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of HP, central RAO, or branch RAO (ICD-9 codes 362.30 to 362.33) were reviewed. Patients with transient monocular visual loss (amaurosis fugax), retinal venous occlusion, and other ocular pathologies were excluded. Electronic and hardcopy medical records were reviewed for demographic data, clinical variables, radiological, and noninvasive vascular lab testing. Duplex and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the carotid arteries were reviewed to confirm the presence of a lesion and quantify the degree of stenosis.\nDuring the study interval, 70 males and 60 females, with a mean age of 68 +/- 16 (+/-SD) years underwent ophthalmologic evaluation. Symptoms were present in 61% of patients and included eye pain, blurred vision, or atypical visual symptoms, while 39% were asymptomatic. Atherosclerotic risk factors in this population included the presence of hypertension (73%), diabetes (33%), hyperlipidemia (75%), and tobacco use (38%). A majority of patients underwent carotid interrogation via Duplex imaging (68%). Carotid bifurcation stenoses ipsilateral to the ocular findings were <30% in 68% of the patients, between 30 and 60% in 22% and >60% in only 8% of patients. Six patients with lesions greater than 60% went on to have either a carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting. Follow-up data on this group ranged from 1 to 49 months (median, 22 months), with no stroke or transient ischemic attack identified. There were five deaths during follow-up; none related to stroke. Serial carotid Duplex examinations failed to identify progression of carotid stenoses in this group of patients. Overall survival was 94% at 36 months for this cohort.\nThe presence of a HP or RAO is associated with a low prevalence of extracranial cerebrovascular disease that requires intervention. Furthermore, in contradistinction to amaurosis fugax, these ocular findings are not associated with a high risk for hemispheric neurological events.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the association of anatomic and temporal characteristics of graft-threatening lesions with the efficacy of percutaneous and open graft revision for failing infrainguinal vein grafts.\nConsecutive open and endovascular revisions for graft threatening lesions were reviewed. We evaluated graft durability and individual target lesion response to open and endovascular treatment to determine characteristics that may influence outcomes. Treatment failure was defined as target lesion restenosis or graft occlusion.\nEighty-four (58 endovascular, 26 open) infrainguinal vein graft revisions were performed in 67 failing, nonthrombosed infrainguinal vein grafts. Primary assisted graft patency at 5 years was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46% to 77%). Follow-up was 29.5 +/- 19.2 months. Grafts treated for early lesions (<6 months) failed (occlusion or need for additional interventions) more frequently than those with late occurring lesions (P = .03). Overall target lesion revascularization patency was 45% (95% CI, 32% to 58%) at 3 years. Average time to target lesion revascularization failure was 7.5 months, with no significant difference noted between endovascular and open treatment groups. Overall target lesion revascularization patency at 3 years was also not significantly different between open and endovascular groups at 54% (95% CI, 30% to 73%) vs 41% (95% CI, 25% to 56%; P = .15). When divided by early and late-occurring target lesions, endovascular treatment of early lesions was associated with inferior patency compared with open procedures; no difference in patency was seen between treatment groups for late lesions. When divided by target lesion location (anastomotic vs mid-graft), treatment for both proximal and distal anastomotic target lesion was associated with inferior patency compared with mid-graft revision at 32% (95% CI, 17% to 47%) vs 62% (95% CI, 37% to 87%) at 3 years (P = .03). In addition, although results of anastomotic target lesion treatment significantly favored open repair, even open repair of anastomotic target lesions was associated with a <50% patency rate at 3 years. In contrast, mid-graft target lesions treated with open revisions were uniformly successful compared with a 54% patency at 3 years with endovascular treatment (P = .24). Short lesions (<2 cm) fared equally well with either endovascular or open treatment. Univariate analysis noted only anastomotic treatment was associated with significantly increased odds of failure.\nGrafts that develop early lesions fare poorly regardless of treatment modality. Lesions involving anastomoses of failing grafts are better treated with open revision, but patency after treatment of such lesions is still worse than treatment of mid-graft lesions. In contrast, the method of treatment does not influence outcome after treatment of mid-graft target lesions. Thus, endovascular therapy should be reserved for focal, late-appearing lesions involving the mid-graft.",

    "abstract": "Studies using histologic examination and protein analysis of atherosclerotic plaques are increasingly being performed, but reproducibility of plaque histology and variation of plaque composition among different parts of the plaque, which are key to reliability of these studies, are relatively unexplored. Therefore, this study investigated the intraobserver and interobserver variability of plaque histology and spatial variability in plaque composition.\nAtherosclerotic plaques (n = 100) obtained during carotid endarterectomy were divided into 0.5-cm segments. Paraffin sections were stained and semiquantitatively analyzed (four categories: no, minor, moderate, and heavy) for fat, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, collagen, calcification, thrombus, and overall phenotype. First, to determine the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, two independent observers independently analyzed the plaques. Second, to investigate spatial variability in plaque composition, histologic appearances of the culprit lesions (0-segment) were compared with the histologic appearances of adjacent (+5 mm) and more distant (+10 mm) plaque segments of 30 specimens.\nThe kappa values for intraobserver variability of fat, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, collagen, calcifications, thrombus, and overall phenotype were 0.83, 0.85, 0.71, 0.63, 0.81, 0.80, and 0.86, respectively, and kappa values for interobserver variability were 0.68, 0.74, 0.54, 0.59, 0.82, 0.75, and 0.71, respectively. Comparison of the histologic scorings of adjacent segments revealed a mean kappa of 0.40 (range, 0.33 to 0.60). When the culprit segment was compared with the more distant segment, the mean kappa was 0.24; however, in 91% of cases, the difference between the culprit segment and the distal segment was one category or less.\nSemiquantitative analysis of carotid atherosclerotic plaque histology was well reproducible, both intraobserver and interobserver. Although variation between different plaque segments in histologic appearance was observed, differences were small in almost all cases. Variability in histologic examination needs to be taken into account in studies comparing plaque imaging with histopathology and plaque research studies.",

    "abstract": "Data supporting the utility of percutaneous treatment to maintain vein graft patency have been limited to a collection of single-institution, retrospective analyses. Using the prospective, multi-institutional PREVENT III database, we sought to define the outcomes for endovascular vs surgical vein bypass graft revision and to define predictors for the success or failure of these interventions.\nA nested cohort study of 1404 patients in the PREVENT III trial who underwent infrainguinal vein bypass grafting for critical limb ischemia was performed to identify those patients who underwent either open surgical or endovascular graft revision. All patients in PREVENT III were followed up for 1 year from the initial bypass operation. The following were modeled as end points from the time of the initial open surgical or endovascular revision: freedom from graft reintervention, occlusion, amputation, and death.\nA total of 156 open surgical and 134 endovascular reinterventions were performed, with a mean follow-up after revision of 193 and 151 days, respectively. Although the demographics for each group were similar, the choice of repair was influenced by the interval between the index graft placement and the initial revision, with a high percentage of the early graft revisions treated with an open surgical procedure (0-1 months: 84% open surgical vs 16% endovascular; P < .001). The primary end point (ie, failure resulting in repeat graft revision, graft occlusion, or major amputation) was reached in 30.2% of the endovascular and 26.2% of the open surgical individuals, with significant improvements in the durability of graft revisions noted in the open surgical group (12-month amputation-/revision-free survival of 75% for the open surgical and 56% for the endovascular group; hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-5.26; P = .043). Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed this benefit to be most profound within the subset of thrombosed grafts undergoing salvage (P = .006). For revisions performed to treat graft stenosis, early outcomes were similar, with a trend favoring the open surgical group developing beyond 6 months. Although 80% of open surgical and 64% of endovascular-revised grafts required no further intervention, endovascular revisions necessitated significantly more reinterventions to maintain patency. The mean hospital lengths of stay (open surgical, 2.1 days; endovascular, 1.7 days) and quality of life at completion of the study (VascuQoL: open surgical, 4.72; endovascular, 4.76) were similar between the groups.\nOpen surgical revision of infrainguinal vein grafts provides an increased freedom from further reinterventions or major amputation, but early success rates for endovascular procedures were similar, particularly for nonoccluded grafts. With time, endovascular revisions necessitate an increasing number of reinterventions and manifest higher rates of failure.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to review the currently available literature and to compare the short and long-term results of primary stenting and angioplasty of femoropopliteal occlusive disease by performing a meta-analysis review.\nA systematic review of the literature that was published between September 2000 and January 2007 was performed. All studies that reported data on the long-term results after balloon dilatation or stent implantation were included if at least one-year primary patency or restenosis rate was presented; the study follow-up was at least 1 year and the number of subjects at the start of study was at least 20 patients. Three investigators independently extracted the data. The Pooled survival curves were then constructed for graft patency according to a random-effects protocol for meta-analysis.\nTwenty-four articles were initially identified but only seven were selected and included in this meta-analysis: seven were RCTs publications and one was a retrospective study comparing the outcome of angioplasty and stenting of the femoropopliteal segment. In our meta-analysis, there were a total of 934 patients with 452 patients who underwent balloon angioplasty (273 patients were male) and 482 patients who underwent stenting (297 patients were male). Primary patency at 1-year and postoperative ABI post intervention was used to evaluate the pooled odds ratio (OR) of all studies. The pooled OR of all studies estimate for the 12-month patency rates was 0.989 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.623 to 1.570, P = .962) showing no difference in outcome between the two groups (SE 0.269% to 1.025%). The pooled OR estimate for the postoperative ABI was 0.869 (95% CI, 0.557 to 1.357, P = .561) showing a slight advantage in favor of the angioplasty group but the P value was not statistically significant (SE 0.282% to 1.326%). The 1-year primary patency rates following balloon angioplasty ranged from 45% to 84.2% and at 2 years it varied from 25% to 77.2%. In the stent implantation group, the 1-year primary patency rates varied from 63% to 90%, and 2-year primary patency ranged from 46% to 87%. Heterogeneity was seen among studies, and publication bias could not be excluded.\nThe results of our meta-analysis suggest that stent placement in the femoropopliteal occlusive disease does not increase the patency rate when compared with angioplasty alone at 1 year. This conclusion should be viewed in the light of study-design considerations and all limitations in this meta-analysis that may have an impact of the outcome of stenting and angioplasty after a 1-year follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Regardless of the type of arterial reconstruction, luminal narrowing (stenosis or restenosis) develops in approximately one third of the vessels. In the past, the focus of research has been on the mechanisms of stenosis (intimal hyperplasia, pathologic remodeling) and pharmacologic approaches to prevention. An alternative approach is to induce intimal atrophy after luminal narrowing has developed, thus limiting treatment to only those patients that develop a problem. This approach to treat established disease by reducing wall mass through induction of cell death and extracellular matrix removal would be particularly useful for treating stenosis in synthetic bypass grafts or stented vessels, in which intimal hyperplasia is the primary mechanism of stenosis. This approach may be applicable as well to other vascular proliferative disorders, such as pulmonary hypertension and chronic transplant arteriopathy. Proof of principle has been shown in experiments with antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors that cause neointimal regression in baboon polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts and with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that induce medial atrophy in hypertensive arteries. Possible molecular targets could include PDGF receptors, A20, and BMP4. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of such a therapeutic approach to vascular disease.",

In this report, we describe the treatment of steal syndrome in a patient with a distal radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula using a percutaneous approach and endovascular coils. After coil embolization of the distal radial artery and multiple collateral vessels, steal was no longer visualized using angiography, and the patient's symptoms resolved.",

We report two patients who were found to have renal artery occlusion 1 week after EVAR with Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) infrarenal devices despite patent bilateral renal arteries shown on completion angiograms. Both patients presented with prolonged symptoms of acute renal failure, and uremic encephalopathy developed in one. Both patients were successfully treated with renal artery stenting, which led to symptom resolution and recovery of renal function. Our cases highlight that although postoperative renal occlusion after EVAR is rare, a high index of suspicion and urgent intervention are warranted because renal salvage can be achieved after prolonged ischemic insult.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of death after gastric bypass procedures for obesity, approximating 0.5% to 4%. All bariatric patients, but especially the super-obese, which have a body mass index (BMI) >50 kg/m(2), are at significant risk for postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE). Visualization and weight limitations of fluoroscopy tables exclude most bariatric and all super-obese patients from inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement using fluoroscopy. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided IVC filter placement is the only modality that allows these high-risk patients to have an IVC filter placed.\nHospital and outpatient records of the 494 patients who underwent gastric bypass procedures from January 1, 2004, to May 31, 2006, were reviewed. All patients who had concurrent IVC filter placement with the use of IVUS guidance were selected. Comorbidities, outcomes, and complications were recorded.\nWe identified 27 patients with mean BMI of 70 +/- 3 kg/m(2); of these, 25 were super-obese (BMI >50 kg/m(2)). Procedures included five laparoscopic and 22 open gastric bypass operations. All patients underwent concurrent IVC filter placement using IVUS guidance. In addition to super-obesity, indications for IVC filter placement included history of VTE (n = 4), known hypercoagulable state (n = 2), and profound immobility (n = 21). Mean follow up was 293 +/- 40 days. Technical success rate was 96.3%. There were no catheter site complications. In one surviving patient, a nonfatal pulmonary embolism was detected by computed tomography 2 months postoperatively. Two patients died, and autopsy excluded VTE as the cause of death in both.\nThis study suggests efficacy of IVUS-guided IVC filter placement in preventing mortality from pulmonary embolism in high-risk bariatric patients, including the super-obese. IVUS-guided IVC filter placement can be safely performed with an excellent success rate in all bariatric patients, including the super-obese, who otherwise would not be candidates for IVC filter placement due to the limitations imposed by their large body habitus.",

    "abstract": "We sought to describe modes of failure and associated limb loss after infrainguinal polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafting in patients lacking a saphenous venous conduit and to define specific clinical or hemodynamic factors prognostic for bypass failure.\nWe identified 121 patients (mean age, 67 years; 90 men and 31 women) with determinable outcomes (minimum follow-up, 2 months; mean, 17 months) after 130 prosthetic infrainguinal bypasses between 1997 and 2005. Ischemic presentation was rest pain in 52%, tissue loss in 34%, and disabling claudication and/or popliteal aneurysm in 14%, with 24% of patients requiring a redo bypass. Distal targets were the above-knee (n = 44), distal popliteal (n = 27), or tibial/pedal (n = 59) arteries. Sixty-six (77%) of the below-knee (BK) target (distal popliteal or tibial) bypasses had distal anastomotic adjuncts (vein cuff or patch). Duplex graft surveillance was performed at 1, 4, and 7 months after surgery and twice yearly thereafter, with recording of midgraft velocities and imaging encompassing inflow and outflow vessels. Arteriography and open/endovascular intervention was performed for stenoses identified by duplex scanning (peak systolic velocity >300 cm/s; velocity ratio >3.5). An attempt was made to salvage occluded grafts by using catheter-directed thrombolysis or open techniques. Eighty-six patients (74% of BK bypasses) were placed on chronic warfarin therapy with a target international normalized ratio range between 2 and 3. Prognostic factors were identified by using univariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nThree-year primary, assisted, and secondary patency rates were 39%, 43%, and 59%, respectively, for all bypasses, with no difference noted between above-knee and BK grafts (P = .5). At 3 years, freedom from limb loss was 75%, and patient survival was only 70%, with no adverse effect on survival imparted by amputation. Sixty-nine total adverse events occurred as a result of thrombotic occlusion (n = 51), duplex scan-detected stenosis (n = 13), or graft infection (n = 5). Forty-nine percent of all initial graft occlusions eventually led to amputation. Twenty-three grafts (27% of 86 patients) in patients maintained on chronic warfarin were subtherapeutic at the time of occlusion. Use of a distal anastomotic adjunct with BK bypasses reduced graft thrombosis (35% with vs 60% without) but did not impart a significant patency advantage (P = .07). Multivariate analysis revealed low graft flow (midgraft velocity < or =45 cm/s; odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-19.2), use of warfarin (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 2.1-34.5), and therapeutic warfarin (OR, 24.6; 95% CI, 5.7-106) to be independently predictive for bypass patency. Graft patency was maintained in 89% of grafts remaining therapeutic on warfarin compared with only 55% of subtherapeutic or nonanticoagulated grafts (P < .001). Low-flow grafts (n = 61) occluded more frequently than higher-flow grafts (46% vs 13%; P < .001). Therapeutic warfarin augmented the patency of low-flow (P < .001) but not high-flow (P = .15) grafts.\nLow graft flow was a more common mode of prosthetic bypass failure than development of duplex scan-detected stenotic lesions during follow-up. Early duplex scanning may be more important for characterizing midgraft velocity and related thrombotic potential and selecting patients for chronic anticoagulation. Maintenance of therapeutic warfarin is paramount in optimizing prosthetic bypass patency and limb preservation.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the patterns of ambulatory activity in subjects with and without intermittent claudication.\nThe study participants were 98 subjects limited by intermittent claudication and 129 controls who were matched for age, gender, and race. Subjects were assessed on their ambulatory activity patterns for 1 week with a small, lightweight step activity monitor attached to the ankle using elastic Velcro (Velcro Industries BV, Manchester, NH) straps above the lateral malleolus of the right leg. The step activity monitor recorded the number of strides taken on a minute-to-minute basis, the time spent ambulating, and the time and number of strides measured at low (<15 strides/min), medium (15 to 30 strides/min), and high (>30 strides/min) cadences.\nSubjects with intermittent claudication took fewer total strides each day than the controls (3149 +/- 1557 strides/d vs 4230 +/- 1708 strides/d; P < .001) and fewer strides at medium (1228 +/- 660 strides/day vs 1638 +/- 724 strides/day; P = .001) and high (766 +/- 753 strides/day vs 1285 +/- 1029 strides/day; P < .001) cadences. Subjects with intermittent claudication also had a lower daily average cadence than the controls (11.8 +/- 2.9 strides/min vs 13.5 +/- 3.1 strides/min; P < .001) and spent less total time ambulating each day (264 +/- 109 min/day vs 312 +/- 96 min/day; P = .034), primarily at medium (58 +/- 30 min/day vs 75 +/- 32 min/day; P < .001) and at high (19 +/- 17 min/day vs 30 +/- 22 min/day; P = .001) cadences.\nIntermittent claudication is associated with lower total daily ambulatory activity owing both to less time ambulating and to fewer strides taken while ambulating, particularly at moderate and high cadences.",

Only patients with a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia secondary to atherosclerosis for 3 months or longer were included in the study. Follow-up data have been collected prospectively and include clinical examination and history, as well as graft surveillance consisting of mesenteric duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography, and/or angiography every 6 months for 3 years and then yearly thereafter.\nThirty-nine consecutive patients underwent 41 open revascularization procedures for chronic mesenteric ischemia, comprising 67 bypass grafts. The mean patient age was 65 years (range, 45-85 years), and 44% (n = 17) were male. Symptoms were present on average for 11 months (range, 4-48 months) before treatment. The average weight loss was 11.4 kg, and three patients (7.6%) also had evidence of ischemic enteritis. There was one perioperative death, thus giving a perioperative mortality rate of 2.5%. Perioperative morbidity occurred in five patients (12.2%). Primary graft patency was 92% at 5 years. Seven patients died during follow-up, which ranged from 4 to 161 months (mean, 39 months)-one (2.5%) from mesenteric ischemia. Two (5%) other patients have had recurrent mesenteric ischemic symptoms.\nOpen surgical mesenteric revascularization by bypass grafting for atherosclerotic-induced chronic mesenteric ischemia can be performed with low mortality and morbidity and provides excellent long-term primary patency rates and symptom-free outcomes. Pending more data on the acute and long-term results of endovascular techniques, open mesenteric revascularization remains the gold standard for most patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Subintimal angioplasty (SIA) is an increasingly used method of lower extremity revascularization for patients with chronic arterial occlusions. To assess the technical feasibility, safety, and 3-year outcomes of patients treated with SIA, we performed a retrospective review of our early experience.\nPatient information-including demographics, indications, procedures, noninvasive arterial studies, and postprocedural events-was recorded in a database. Outcomes were determined on an intention-to-treat basis, as well as by technical success, by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Continuous data were compared by using the Student t test, and survival curves were compared by log-rank testing.\nFrom December 2002 through December 2003, 104 patients (105 limbs) underwent SIA of 159 occlusive lesions involving the iliac (n = 10), superficial femoral (n = 85), popliteal (n = 48), or tibial (n = 16) arteries. Sixty-six (62.9%) patients were treated for critical limb ischemia, and 39 patients (37.1%) were treated for disabling claudication. Technical success was achieved in 91 procedures (86.7%) and resulted in a mean increase in ankle-brachial index of 0.36 +/- 0.16. The mean follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 0-46 months). During this period, 18 patients (17.0%) died, and 15 amputations (14.3%) were performed, 6 of which were performed for patients on whom SIA had been unsuccessful. In patients undergoing successful SIA, the primary patency was 55%, 43%, and 35% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Twenty-one patients underwent a total of 23 percutaneous procedures to maintain or restore patency of the SIA during the study period. This resulted in secondary patency rates of 71%, 63%, and 51% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed critical limb ischemia to be the only predictor of reduced primary patency. Fifteen patients with inoperable critical limb ischemia underwent successful SIA. Limb salvage in this group was 54% and 43% at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Limb salvage in operative candidates was 100% and 88% at the same intervals. In patients with disabling claudication, 94% experienced improvement in symptoms 3 months after the procedure, and 68% of patients reported sustained improvement at 36 months. In all operative candidates successfully treated with SIA, freedom from surgical bypass was 83% and 73% at 12 and 36 months, respectively.\nSIA for the treatment of lower extremity chronic arterial occlusions is technically feasible, results in minimal morbidity, and provides satisfactory revascularization without surgical bypass. Secondary patency is comparable to that of autologous vein bypass and is achieved with a low rate of reintervention. When used as first-line therapy, SIA provides most patients with limb salvage and freedom from surgical bypass at 3 years.",

Sixty-six (62.9%) patients were treated for critical limb ischemia, and 39 patients (37.1%) were treated for disabling claudication. Technical success was achieved in 91 procedures (86.7%) and resulted in a mean increase in ankle-brachial index of 0.36 +/- 0.16. The mean follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 0-46 months). During this period, 18 patients (17.0%) died, and 15 amputations (14.3%) were performed, 6 of which were performed for patients on whom SIA had been unsuccessful. In patients undergoing successful SIA, the primary patency was 55%, 43%, and 35% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Twenty-one patients underwent a total of 23 percutaneous procedures to maintain or restore patency of the SIA during the study period. This resulted in secondary patency rates of 71%, 63%, and 51% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed critical limb ischemia to be the only predictor of reduced primary patency. Fifteen patients with inoperable critical limb ischemia underwent successful SIA. Limb salvage in this group was 54% and 43% at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Limb salvage in operative candidates was 100% and 88% at the same intervals. In patients with disabling claudication, 94% experienced improvement in symptoms 3 months after the procedure, and 68% of patients reported sustained improvement at 36 months. In all operative candidates successfully treated with SIA, freedom from surgical bypass was 83% and 73% at 12 and 36 months, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The preferential use of primary iliac stenting vs selective stenting is controversial. This study compares the early and late clinical outcomes of primary vs selective iliac stenting at our institution.\nA total of 110 consecutive patients with iliac stenosis (149 lesions) underwent primary stenting over a recent 5-year period (primary stent group). The early technical and clinical success and late clinical outcomes were compared with 41 patients (41 iliac lesions) who had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) followed by selective stenting for suboptimal PTA (selective stent group). All patients were evaluated clinically and by duplex scanning with ankle-brachial indexes at 1, 6, and 12 months and every 12 months thereafter.\nThe perioperative complication rate for the primary stent group was 2.7% (three minor hematomas) vs 24% for the selective stent group (P < .0001). The overall early clinical success rate was 97% for the primary stent group vs 83% for the selective stent group (P = .002), however, the rate was 100% for short stenosis (A and B lesions <5 cm TASC classification) in both groups; in contrast to 93% for the primary stent group vs 46% for the selective stent group for longer stenoses (TASC - C and D lesions, P = .0003). The overall late clinical success was comparable for both groups: 88% for the primary stent group vs 80% for the selective stent group, however, this rate was superior for the longer lesions in the primary stent group, 84% vs 46% (P = .007). The primary patency rates at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years were 98%, 94%, 87%, and 77% for the primary stent group vs 83%, 78%, 69%, and 69% for the selective stent group (P = .030). These rates were comparable in both groups for shorter lesions: 100%, 98%, 98%, and 87% for the primary stent group vs 100%, 93%, 85%, and 85% for the selective stent group (P = .637). However, they were superior for the primary stent group in longer lesions: 96%, 90%, and 72% vs 46%, 46%, and 28% for the selective stent group at 1, 2, and 3 years (P < .0001).\nThe overall early clinical success rate was superior for the primary stent group. However, the initial (early) and late clinical success rates were comparable for short lesions (TASC - A and B lesions), but were inferior in selective stenting for longer lesions (TASC - C and D). Therefore, primary stenting should be offered to all TASC - C and D lesions.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment for mycotic aortic aneurysms is not optimal. Even with a large excision, extensive debridement, in situ or extra-anatomical reconstruction, and with or without lifelong antibiotic treatment, mycotic aneurysms still carry very high mortality and morbidity. The use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic aortic aneurysms simplifies the procedure and provides a good alternative for this critical condition. However, the question remains: if EVAR is placed in an infected bed, what is the outcome of the infection? Does it heal, become aggravated, or even cause a disastrous aortic rupture? In this study, we tried to clarify the risk factors for such an adverse response.\nA literature review was undertaken by using MEDLINE. All relevant reports on endoluminal management of mycotic aortic aneurysms were included. Logistic regressions were applied to identify predictors of persistent infection.\nA total of 48 cases from 22 reports were included. The life-table analysis showed that the 30-day survival rate was 89.6% +/- 4.4%, and the 2-year survival rate was 82.2% +/- 5.8%. By univariate analysis, age 65 years or older, rupture of the aneurysm (including those with aortoenteric fistula and aortobronchial fistula), and fever at the time of operation were identified as significant predictors of persistent infection, and preoperative use of antibiotics for longer than 1 week and an adjunct procedure combined with EVAR were identified as significant protective factors for persistent infection. However, by multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only significant independent predictors identified were rupture of aneurysm and fever.\nEVAR seems a possible alternative method for treating mycotic aortic aneurysms. Identification of the risk factors for persistent infection may help to decrease surgical morbidity and mortality. EVAR could be used as a temporary measure; however, a definite surgical treatment should be considered for patients present with aneurysm rupture or fever.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic injury of the thoracic aorta is a life-threatening complication in patients who sustain deceleration or crush injuries. The magnitude of force necessary to cause blunt thoracic aortic injury results in a high proportion of concomitant injuries, posing a significant challenge for prioritizing management. Open surgical mortality is increased in the presence of coexisting head, lung, and abdominal injuries. Spinal cord ischemia may occur following aortic cross-clamping and operative hypotension. Endovascular stent-graft placement offers a safe, effective, and timely treatment option. The aim of this study was to assess our single center experience of endovascular repair following acute blunt traumatic aortic injury.\nData from thirteen consecutive patients (mean age, 43.2 years; range, 16 to 84 years) with acute blunt traumatic aortic injury treated by endovascular stent-graft insertion between October 2001 and March 2007 was prospectively collected. Demographics, injury characteristics, technique, and complications were recorded. Follow-up data consisted of computed tomographic angiography and plain chest radiography at regular intervals. Mean and median follow-up after stent-graft implantation were 28.9 and 29 months, respectively.\nAll patients underwent endovascular repair within a median of 9 hours from hospital presentation. Two patients underwent carotico-carotid bypass immediately prior to endovascular stenting during a single anesthetic. Stent-graft implantation was technically successful in all patients. No patient required conversion to open surgical repair of the acute blunt traumatic aortic injury. Procedure-related paraplegia was zero. Complications included proximal migration of initial stent-graft in one patient and iliac artery avulsion in another patient with consequent ilio-femoral bypass. The median hospital stay was 17 days. There were no in-hospital deaths.\nEndovascular repair is evolving as the procedure of choice for acute blunt traumatic aortic injury. Treatment of lesions that extend into the aortic arch is feasible with extra-anatomical bypass. In our study, endovascular repair of blunt traumatic aortic injury is a safe procedure with low morbidity and a mortality rate of zero.",

    "abstract": "Endotension has been defined as persistently increased pressure within the excluded sac of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resulting in increasing aneurysm size after endovascular repair in the absence of endoleak. Devices that use expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) have been associated with the development of endotension and continued AAA enlargement. In this study, intra-aneurysmal pressure and aneurysm content were evaluated after endovascular repair with the Enovus ePTFE stent graft in a canine model.\nProsthetic ePTFE aneurysms, each containing a solid-state, strain-gauge pressure transducer, were implanted in the infrarenal aorta of 13 mongrel dogs (25-35 kg). A second pressure transducer was inserted into the native aorta for systemic arterial pressure measurement. The stent graft was then deployed to exclude the aneurysm via distal aortic access. Comparison was made among three distinct stent grafts: the Trivascular Enovus (nonporous ePTFE; four animals), the original Gore Excluder (porous ePTFE; five animals), and the Medtronic AneuRx (Dacron; four animals). Daily systemic and intra-AAA pressures were measured for 4 weeks. Intra-aneurysmal pressures were indexed to simultaneously measured systemic pressures. After 4 weeks, the aorta, the prosthetic aneurysm, and its contents were harvested, photographed, and processed for histologic investigation with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining.\nWithin 24 hours after exclusion, the mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure within the AAA sac tapered to less than 20% of systemic pressure for all three stent graft types. Throughout the postoperative period, significantly lower indexed intra-aneurysmal pressures were present in the Enovus- and AneuRx-treated aneurysms as compared with those treated with the original Excluder stent graft (0.05 +/- 0.04, 0.16 +/- 0.06, and 0.06 +/- 0.03 for the Enovus, Excluder, and AneuRx, respectively). Histologic analysis of the Enovus-treated aneurysms demonstrated intraluminal content characterized almost entirely by erythrocytes and infrequent white blood cells without the fibrin organization-characteristics of acute or chronic thrombus. This contrasted with the content of the Excluder-treated aneurysms, which contained poorly organized fibrin deposition suggestive of acute thrombus, and of the AneuRx-treated aneurysms, which demonstrated mature, well-organized collagenous connective tissue.\nExclusion of the AAA with the Enovus stent graft resulted in nearly complete elimination of intra-aneurysmal pressure in this model. Histologic analysis of the aneurysm content further suggested complete exclusion, including elimination of circulating clotting factors and fibroblasts responsible for thrombus formation and reorganization. Ultimately, clinical evaluation will be necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of this stent graft in preventing the development of endotension.",

The dogs were divided into two groups. A test group (n = 6) received experimental antibiotic-bonded gelatin-sealed knitted polyester grafts, loaded with two antibiotics, rifampin and tobramycin. A control group (n = 6) received commercial gelatin-sealed knitted polyester grafts. At the end of graft implantation, 50 mul of a 1.8 x 10(4) CFU/mL S aureus solution were instilled directly over the graft. One week after implantation, grafts were harvested with sterile technique. Quantitative cultures were obtained from all the harvested grafts. The results were expressed as colony-forming units per cm(2) of surface of the graft. Bacteriological study was also performed on various tissue samples. The chi(2) test was used to compare the culture proven infection of control and antibiotics-bonded grafts.\nMean inoculum size was similar in the two groups of dogs. Five of the six control grafts grew S aureus A980142 at the time of graft removal, whereas none of the six antibiotic-bonded gelatin-sealed grafts were infected (P = .0192). None of the organ samples were infected in the group implanted with antibiotic-bonded grafts, whereas 15/34 samples grew S. aureus in the control group.\nThese results indicate that this gelatin sealed graft prebonded with two antibiotics resists infection caused by S aureus graft contamination in a dog model.",

    "abstract": "The syndecan family of cell surface proteoglycans can bind and modulate the activity of a diverse group of soluble and insoluble ligands, which have been shown to modulate events relevant to acute tissue repair and chronic injury responses. The expression of members of the syndecan family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans during the course of aortic aneurysm formation has not been previously investigated. In this investigation, the spatiotemporal expression of syndecan-1, -2, and -4 was characterized in a murine model of aneurysm formation.\nApoE-deficient mice were maintained on an atherogenic diet for 8 weeks with concurrent infusion of angiotensin II (0.75 mg/kg/day SQ). The expression of syndecan-1, -2, and -4 at the site of aneurysm formation was characterized by immunohistochemical staining and colocalization determined by double fluorescent immunostaining. Correlative examination was performed on tissue specimens harvested from patients at the time of open aneurysm repair.\nIn the aortic wall of age-matched, untreated mice, syndecan-4 was localized to the smooth muscle cells of the media. However, neither syndecan-1 nor syndecan-2 could be detected. Within 1 week of initiating a high fat diet and infusion of angiotensin II, syndecan-1 was abundantly expressed in infiltrating macrophages, predominantly localized to the periadventitial aorta. The expression of macrophage-associated syndecan-1 was accentuated during the course of aneurysm formation. As the aneurysm matured, syndecan-2 was abundantly expressed within the aortic thrombus and heterogeneous syndecan-4 staining noted within the aortic media. Significantly, abundant syndecan-1 positive macrophages were observed in explanted human specimens.\nGiven the established functional properties of this family heparan sulfate proteoglycans, chronically accelerated macrophage syndecan-1 shedding could generate a sustained proinflammatory, proteolytic, growth-stimulating environment. As a component of a counterbalancing reparative process, cell surface syndecan-2 may assist in TGF-beta mediated responses to limit the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

Angiography demonstrated three saccular aneurysms of the femoropopliteal artery. The largest measured 3 cm in diameter. Resection of the aneurysms and femoropopliteal interposition grafting using reversed saphenous vein was performed through a medial surgical approach. Arterial involvement in neurofibromatosis is a well known but infrequent occurrence. Stenotic lesions predominate. Aneurysmal defects are less common, and rupture of peripheral arteries is exceptional. Neurofibromatous invasion and dysplasia of the tunica media of the femoropopliteal vessel were confirmed by means of pathologic study. We think this is the second reported case of a femoropopliteal artery aneurysm and rupture associated with neurofibromatosis.",

Initial angiogram revealed the anterior tibial artery (ATA) was subtotally occluded showing a \"strings of beads\" pattern, which is typical of the arteries affected by FMD.

We report on a young woman who after three consecutive attempts of endovascular therapy with balloon angioplasty and stenting for MALS, each followed by gross symptom recurrence and a cumulative weight loss of 10 kg, underwent open surgical division of the ligament and reconstruction of the celiac artery. Despite the initial response of MALS to endovascular therapy, the extrinsic pressure exerted on the celiac artery by the surrounding dense fibrous/ganglionic tissue resulted in slippage of the stents and/or failure of their material. These findings militate against the use of balloon angioplasty and stenting primarily in patients with MALS without prior release of the extrinsic compression on the celiac (and/or superior mesenteric) artery by dividing the surrounding median arcuate ligament and/or ganglionic tissue with open or laparoscopic surgery.",

    "abstract": "We report our experience with the use of endoluminal grafts to control emergency bleeding in two patients with tracheoinnominate fistulas and three patients with carotid blowouts. Systemic infectious complications were not seen. However, rebleeding occurred in one patient, and extensive stent coverage to control bleeding was required in a second. Survival was usually limited by the patient's cancer. There was one long-term survivor without cancer whose tracheostomy was placed for neurologic compromise. A review of the literature for similar cases identified 18 additional endografts placed for carotid blowout and 3 placed for tracheoinnominate fistulas. Overall, infectious complications occurred in only two patients, whereas rebleeding occurred in eight patients. On the basis of these findings, we believe that endografts are useful to control emergency hemorrhage in these two pathologies because treatment is usually palliative, given the poor survival secondary to the underlying disease. However, more extensive graft coverage may be necessary considering the erosive nature of these processes.",

Recent improvements in endovascular treatments have led to their proposed use for infected aneurysms in patients for whom open surgery poses too high a risk. We report on a 68-year-old man with a tuberculous aortic aneurysm who had been treated with an endoprosthesis and antituberculosis chemotherapy. His clinical and radiological follow-up was uneventful and led to the discontinuation of pharmacological treatment after 16 months. However, a recurrence of the infection led to a fatal aortic rupture 4 months after discontinuation of therapy.",

    "abstract": "The response of mice arteries to injury varies significantly between strains. FVB mice develop large neointimas after injury, whereas very small lesions form in C57BL/6 mice. After injury, platelet interaction with the denuded artery and early smooth muscle (SMC) replication are identical in both strains; however, the migration of SMCs differs significantly. FVB cells readily move into the developing neointima, whereas only the occasional C57BL/6 cells migrate. Injured arteries showed no difference in matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and plasminogen activator activities. In vitro, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in combination with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates migration of FVB cells but inhibits migration of C57BL/6 SMCs. Both SMCs migrate equally well to PDGF alone. One explanation is that the SMCs express different S1P receptors. Real-time polymerase chain reaction shows that FVB cells express higher levels of S1P receptor-1 (S1P(1)) compared with C57BL/6 cells, which express higher levels of S1P receptor-2 (S1P(2)). In addition, the migration of C57BL/6 cells can be increased by inhibiting S1P(2), whereas inhibiting S1P(1) expression slows the migration of FVB cells. Taken together these studies suggest that expression of S1P receptors vary within inbred mouse strains and that S1P is critical for SMC migration and lesion formation after injury.",

    "abstract": "Iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS) results from compression of the left iliac vein by the overlying right iliac artery against the pelvic brim. In many cases, patients are symptomatic. In symptomatic cases, management consists of angioplasty and stenting. Although therapy is often initially successful, factors associated with long-term outcome have been poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with stent patency.\nThe medical records of all patients who underwent iliac vein percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting from January 1996 to December 2006 for symptomatic IVCS were reviewed retrospectively. There were 50 women and 8 men, with a mean age of 42 years (median, 39 years; range, 17-71 years). Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates were determined. Patient characteristics and clinical variables were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis to determine association with vein patency.\nSymptoms consisted of lower extremity swelling (81%) and lower extremity pain (67%). Iliac vein obstruction was treated with pharmacologic thrombolysis (31% of patients) and mechanical thrombus fragmentation (17% of patients). The primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of angioplasty/stenting were 74.1%, 79.7%, and 85.8% at 1 year and 38.1%, 62.8%, and 73.8% at 5 years, respectively. Using a Cox proportional risk model, male sex (hazard ratio, 6.5; P = .001), recent trauma (hazard ratio, 5.3; P = .001), and age younger than 40 years (hazard ratio, 3.8; P = .015) were associated with decreased primary patency. In the absence of any risk factors, primary patency was 94.4% at 1 year and 63.0% at 5 years, decreasing to 28.6% and 0% for two or more risk factors.\nPatency rates for iliac vein percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting in patients with IVCS can potentially be predicted on the basis of a multivariate model. Assessing risk factors allows for patient stratification and appropriate clinical decision making. Prospective validation of these variables is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous revascularization has become increasingly utilized for the treatment of lower extremity ischemia. Patients with limb-threat have been shown to be at increased risk of failure, although the reasons for this remain unclear. This study analyzed factors associated with percutaneous treatment failure, focusing specifically on lesion characteristics and treatment complexity.\nWe retrospectively reviewed percutaneous infra-inguinal interventions performed for peripheral occlusive disease between 2002 and 2005 using a prospectively maintained database. Lesion characteristics were assessed by angiography, and lesions were graded according to the TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) criteria. Patency was expressed by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank analysis. Multivariate Cox-regression analysis was used to assess significant factors on univariate analysis. Mean follow-up was 11.8 months.\nA total of 324 interventions for claudication (55.8%), rest pain (18.4%), or tissue loss (25.8%) were analyzed, including 284 primary interventions and 40 re-interventions in 258 patients (mean age 72.1 +/- 10 years, 51.0% male). TASC lesion grades included: A (4.9%), B (29.3%), C (37.7%), and D (28.1%). Isolated single-level interventions (femoral, popliteal, or tibial) were performed in 38.9%, while two-level interventions were performed in 46.2% and three-level interventions in 14.9%. Overall primary patency (+/- SD) at 6, 12, and 18 months was 87 +/- 2%, 66 +/- 2% and 59 +/- 4%, respectively. Secondary patency at 6, 12, and 18 months was 89 +/- 2%, 76 +/- 3%, and 69 +/- 5%. One-year limb salvage rate (limb-threat patients) was 85 +/- 3%. Limb-threatening ischemia as the indication for intervention was most highly associated with failure of both primary and secondary patency and was associated with four indicators of lesion severity and treatment complexity, including increasing TASC grade, multilevel intervention, tibial intervention, and reduced tibial outflow. One-year primary patency was inversely correlated with TASC severity (TASC A-C: 67 +/- 6%, D: 61 +/- 4%; P < .05), multilevel intervention (76 +/- 5% and 49 +/- 9% for single vs multilevel, P = .002), distal interventions (74 +/- 5% and 57 +/- 7% for femoral vs tibial, P < .05), and decreased tibial runoff (83 +/- 6% and 52 +/- 6% for three- vs < three-vessels, P < .02). No differences in secondary patency or limb-salvage rates existed for these lesion- and treatment-related variables. Multilevel intervention and tibial intervention remained significant independently associated with primary patency on multivariate analysis.\nPatients with limb-threatening ischemia are at increased risk of initial failure compared with claudicants, likely as a result of the increased prevalence of advanced lesion severity and treatment complexity, which are associated with decreased primary patency. However, this finding did not extend to secondary patency or limb-salvage in the overall patient population. Although additional studies with longer follow-up are needed, these findings argue that percutaneous intervention may still be considered as a primary treatment modality with the understanding that these patients may have higher re-intervention rates and may ultimately require salvage open surgical bypass for persistent failures of percutaneous therapy.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative cardiac risks and clinical indications for vascular surgery are both important determinants of outcome following a vascular operation. Using the nonrandomized cohort from the Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) Trial, we analyzed the predictors of outcome based on the presenting vascular problem and prevalence of comorbid conditions and cardiac risks.\nBetween March 1, 1999 and February 28, 2003, 4414 patients were ineligible for randomization in the CARP Trial and their survival was retrieved through the BIRLS system (the Department of Veterans Affairs Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem). Surgical indications were either an abdominal aortic aneurysm (N = 1598) or lower extremity ischemia for claudication (N = 1116), rest pain (N = 670), or tissue loss (N = 1030). Patients were screened for major cardiac risks that included a history of angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, pathological q-waves, and diabetes. The absence of multiple cardiac risks, as the sole reason for exclusion from randomization, occurred in 2314 (52.4%) screened patients and their probability of survival at 2.5-year post-surgery was 0.88. This was better than the survival of the remaining excluded patients (N = 2100), which was 0.75 (P < .0001) and the randomized cohort (N = 462), which was 0.80 (P < .0001). By Cox regression analysis, urgent surgery, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias and creatinine >3.5 mg/dL were significantly associated with long-term postoperative mortality.\nPatients without multiple cardiac risks or comorbid conditions have a good outcome following elective vascular surgery. Urgent surgery, creatinine >3.5 mg/dL, congestive heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmias are identifiers of a poor long-term outcome and may justify aggressive strategies for risk-stratification in the postoperative period.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are caused by inflammatory processes in the wall of the aorta resulting in degradation of structural proteins. This inflammatory process is mediated, in part, by cytokines, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a predominantly anti-inflammatory cytokine. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene that affects transcription has been associated with AAA in a small study. The aim of this study was to determine whether this polymorphism is associated with AAA and also examine its effect on the growth of small AAA.\nA case control study was performed. A total of 389 patients with AAA and 404 healthy controls were recruited. IL-10-1082 polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based methods. In the case of patients with small AAA (<5.5 cm), serial size measurements were recorded to determine mean growth rate. There was a statistically significant difference both in allele and genotype frequencies between the case and control groups with the IL-10-1082 'A' allele being more common in the AAA group (P = .006). In the AAA group, genotype frequencies were as follows: GG 84, GA 201, and AA 104. In the control group, the genotype frequencies were GG 118, GA 205, and AA 81. The odds ratio for the 'A' allele as a risk factor for AAA was 1.50 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.07). Regression modeling revealed that the IL-10-1082 genotype was, however, not independently associated with AAA if age, tobacco use, hypertension, and history of coronary or peripheral artery disease was taken into account. There was a trend towards lower plasma IL-10 level in IL-10 AA carriers, but the IL-10 'A' allele did not have any discernible effect on the growth of small AAA.\nThis study demonstrates that the IL-10-1082 'A' allele is associated with AAA, although this association is likely to be secondary to an association between IL-10-1082 genotype and other markers of cardiovascular disease rather than AAA per se.",

    "abstract": "In multiple comparisons of open vs endovascular (EVAR) repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, the prior assumption that open repair produced superior durability has been challenged by advocates of EVAR. Although focus on EVAR reintervention has been intense, few contemporary studies document late outcomes after open repair; this was the goal of this study.\nFrom January 1994 to December 1998 (chosen to ensure a minimum 5-year follow-up), 540 patients underwent elective open repair. Surveillance imaging (computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans) was obtained for 152 (57%) of the 269 patients who remained alive at a mean follow-up of 87 months. Study end points included freedom from graft-related interventions and aneurysm-related and overall survival (Kaplan-Meier test); factors predictive of these end points were determined by multivariate analysis.\nThe mean age at operation was 73 years. A total of 76% of patients were male; 11% had renal insufficiency (creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dL), and 13% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The aortic cross-clamp position was suprarenal in 135 (25%) patients, and 284 (53%) of patients had bifurcated grafts placed. Operative mortality (30 days) was 3%, and the median length of hospital stay was 7 days. Postoperative complications occurred in 68 (13%) patients. Predictors of postoperative complications included a history of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; P = .01) and renal insufficiency (HR, 2.5; P = .02). The mean follow-up for all patients was 87 months. Actuarial survival was 70.7% +/- 2% and 44.3% +/- 2.4% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Negative predictors of long-term survival included advanced age (HR, 1.1; P < .001), history of myocardial infarction (HR, 1.37; P = .02), and renal insufficiency (HR, 1.5; P = .04). Freedom from graft-related reintervention was 98.2% +/- 0.8% and 94.3% +/- 3.4% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. There were 13 late graft-related complications in 11 (2%) patients (mean follow-up, 7.2 years). Findings included seven anastomotic pseudoaneurysms (five were repaired), four graft limb occlusions, and two graft infections. Aneurysms were identified in noncontiguous arterial segments in 68 (45%) of 152 patients, most of which involved the iliac arteries and required no treatment because of small size. Late aortic aneurysms proximal to the repair were identified in 24% of patients, and 29 (19%) patients had multiple late synchronous aneurysms.\nOpen repair remains a safe and durable option for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms, with an excellent associated 10-year survival in patients who undergo operation at 75 years of age or younger. In addition, the freedom from graft-related reintervention is superior to that of EVAR. Finally, continued surveillance after open repair is appropriate and should be directed toward the detection of other aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Accurate data regarding the prevalence and associated risk factors for aneurysmal disease is essential when determining the appropriateness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Although women are poorly represented in most large studies of AAA prevalence, the US Preventative Services Task Force recently recommended against primary screening for AAA in women. The purpose of this analysis was to define the prevalence and risk factors associated with the development of AAA in women.\nA free duplex ultrasound screening was offered to men and women with cardiovascular risk factors or a family history of AAA. Patients were recruited through advertising at local screening centers and screenings were performed between 2004 and 2006. Demographic information and cardiovascular and aneurysmal disease risk factors were obtained for each patient through a questionnaire. A total of 17,540 subjects were screened for AAA, including 10,012 women (mean age 69.6 years) and 7528 men (mean age 70.0 years). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed on the subset of women that were screened to determine risk factors for and prevalence of AAA.\nSeventy-four aneurysms were detected in women (including four aneurysms >5 cm diameter and 70 aneurysms 3 to 5 cm diameter) while 291 were detected in men, resulting in prevalence rates of 0.7% and 3.9%, respectively. Increasing age (odds ratio [OR]= 4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98 to 10.54, P < .0001), history of tobacco use (OR = 3.29, 95% CI 1.86 to 5.80, P < .0001), and cardiovascular disease (OR= 3.57, 95% CI 2.19 to 5.84, P < .0001) were independently associated with AAA in women on univariate and multivariable analysis. Women with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors were more commonly found to have AAAs and had a prevalence rate of AAA as high as 6.4%.\nAlthough the medical literature suggests a low prevalence rate of AAA in women in the general population, specific risk factors are associated with the development of AAA, and subgroups of women can be identified that are at a substantially increased risk of aneurysmal disease. In particular, elevated rates of AAA were found among women of advanced age (> or =65 years) with a history of smoking or heart disease. These data support the notion that women with such risk factors should be considered for AAA screening.",

    "abstract": "Decision making for peripheral vascular disease can be quite complex as a result of pre-existing compromise of patient functional status, anatomic considerations, uncertainty of favorable outcome, medical comorbidities, and limitations in life expectancy. The ability of prospective decision-analysis models to predict individual quality of life in patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease was tested.\nThis was a prospective cohort study. The settings were university and Veterans Administration vascular surgery practices. All 214 patients referred with symptomatic lower extremity arterial disease of any severity over a 2-year period were screened, and 206 were enrolled. A Markov model was compared with standard clinical decision-making. Utility assessment and generalized (Short Form-36; SF-36) and disease-specific (Walking Impairment Questionnaire; WIQ) quality of life were derived before treatment. Estimates of treatment outcome probabilities and intended and actual treatment plans were provided by attending vascular surgeons. The main outcome measures were generalized (SF-36) and disease-specific (WIQ) variables at study entry and at 4 and 12 months.\nPrimary intervention consisted of amputation for 9, bypass for 42, angioplasty for 8, and medical treatment for 147 patients. Considering all patients, no improvement in mean overall patient quality of life measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Score (27 +/- 8 vs 28 +/- 8; P = .87) or WIQ (39 +/- 22 vs 39 +/- 23; P = .13) was noted 12 months after counseling and treatment by the vascular surgeons. Individually considered SF-36 categories were improved only for Bodily Pain (40 +/- 23 vs 49 +/- 25; P = .03), with the most significant improvement observed among patients with the most severe pain (68 +/- 25 vs 37 +/- 23; P = .02) and among those undergoing bypass (60 +/- 29 vs 31 +/- 22; P = .02). It is noteworthy that when the treatment chosen was incongruent with the Markov model, patients were more likely to report a poorer quality of life at 1 year (Physical Component Score, 25 +/- 8 vs 29 +/- 8; P < .001). The quality of life predicted at baseline by the Markov model correlated positively with the Physical Component Score (r = 0.23), Bodily Pain (r = 0.33), and Fatigue (r = 0.44) and negatively with WIQ (r = -0.08) observed 1 year later.\nProspective application of an individualized decision Markov model in patients with vascular disease was predictive of patient quality of life at 1 year. The patient's outcome was worse when the treatment received did not follow the model's recommendation. This decision analysis model may be useful to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes with standard clinical decision making.",

We hypothesized that debulking such PAOs by using rheolytic thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and selective stenting (PTA/S) is safe and enables single-session treatment with minimal risk of embolization.\nBetween February 2004 and January 2007, 16 male patients (mean age, 68.9 +/- 11.1 years; range, 54-84 years) presenting with disabling claudication (n = 1), rest pain (n = 5), and tissue loss (n = 10; mean duration, 11 +/- 8 weeks; range, 4-26 weeks) were prospectively followed up after rheolytic thrombectomy and angioplasty and selective stenting of their PAO.\nThe mean occlusion length was 11.6 +/- 4.5 cm. After rheolytic thrombectomy, the occlusions were converted to long stenoses (mean length of 7.6 +/- 3.6 cm). Self-expanding stents were used in 10 of 16 (mean length of 8.3 +/- 4.4 cm). Additional recanalizations of occlusions of the iliac artery and proximal superficial femoral artery were performed before popliteal artery recanalizations in two patients. Ankle-brachial indexes increased from 0.27 +/- 0.22 to 0.94 +/- 0.13. No case of distal embolization was observed. Adjuvant thrombolysis was used in only one case to improve runoff. Inline flow to the foot was achieved in 15 of 16 cases. Three occlusions occurred at 3, 6, and 20 months after surgery (mean follow-up, 15.7 +/- 10.0 months), and two patients underwent successful thrombolysis. The third patient refused further intervention and remains a claudicant. One-year primary and secondary patency rates were 84% and 92%, respectively. Two limb losses occurred at 7 and 9 months as a result of recurrent foot infection in patients with diabetes, both with patent popliteal arteries (1-year limb salvage rate, 83%).\nWe advocate debulking isolated subacute PAOs with rheolytic thrombectomy when they are easily crossed, because this enables recanalization of these lesions in a single setting, thus obviating the additional need for thrombolysis in most cases, with seemingly minimal risk of distal embolization. This simple approach is effective and widely available.",

    "abstract": "Para-anastomotic aneurysms involving the aorta and iliac arteries can occur years after aortic surgery and are at risk for rupture and erosion into surrounding structures. We report on our continued experience with patients who have been treated for these lesions with endovascular management as an alternative to traditional open repair.\nPatients who underwent endovascular repair of para-anastomotic aneurysms involving the distal aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, or iliac arteries were prospectively followed up in a database. Patient comorbidities, initial aortic pathology, initial graft configuration, aneurysm characteristics, evidence of infection, type and configuration of endograft used, and follow-up were analyzed.\nFrom 1997 to 2006, 53 patients with 65 para-anastomotic aneurysms were treated with endovascular stent grafts. Patients who were originally treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease presented significantly later than those treated for aneurysmal disease (15.8 vs 8.9 years, P < .01) The initial technical success rate was 98%. Endoleaks were identified in six patients (11%) < or =1 month of surgery, and three required reintervention, including open conversions. Endoleak complications were significantly associated with patients who had symptomatic para-anastomotic aneurysms (P = .01). Perioperative mortality after endovascular repair was 3.8%. Overall mortality within a mean follow-up of 18 months was 49% and was significantly associated with older age at the time of endovascular treatment (P = .03).\nEndovascular repair of para-anastomotic aneurysms involving the aorta and iliac arteries is technically feasible and is associated with a low perioperative morbidity and mortality. Close follow-up is required to identify endoleaks. Long-term survival is limited in older patients. We recommend endovascular stent graft repair for para-anastomotic aneurysms in anatomically suitable patients.",

    "abstract": "To compare endovascular and open repair of isolated or solitary iliac artery aneurysms (SIAAs).\nWe present the results of 55 patients with 58 SIAAs that were treated between January 1998 and December 2005 in two European university hospitals. In one center, the standard procedure, if not contraindicated, was endovascular repair, and 32 (58.2%) consecutive patients with 33 SIAAs were treated by using only endovascular techniques (endovascular iliac aneurysm repair; EVIAR). In the second center, 23 (41.8%) consecutive patients with 25 SIAAs were treated by conventional surgical techniques because advanced endovascular skills were not available before late 2005. EVIAR included coil embolization of the hypogastric artery in 13 of the 33 cases with aneurysmal involvement of the internal iliac artery. In the \"open\" group of patients, midline laparotomy and a transperitoneal approach with bifurcated aortoiliac graft replacement was performed in 4 cases, and a lower lateral abdominal incision with a retroperitoneal approach and iliac replacement was performed in 19 cases.\nThe mean follow-up period was similar in both groups (EVIAR, 35.3 +/- 21.3 months; open, 31.3 +/- 19.9 months). The two groups of patients had similar demographic and clinical characteristics compared with previous reported series, and data analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups only in hypertension. The early and mid-term outcomes and especially the 3-year primary patency rates were also similar between the two groups (EVIAR, 97%; open, 100%). In the EVIAR group, there was no evidence of endoleaks, kinking, or graft migration, and 26 aneurysms remained stable, whereas in 7 aneurysms a slight decrease in size (>10% in diameter) was observed. Comparison of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay revealed significant differences (P < .001) in favor of the endovascular group. Secondary intervention was not necessary in any patient in either group during the entire follow-up period.\nElective management with endovascular or open techniques of isolated iliac aneurysms can be accomplished with very low morbidity and mortality rates. Better intraoperative and early postoperative outcomes, as well as the durable mid-term results in our EVIAR-treated patients, indicate that endovascular techniques could be offered as first-line therapy of SIAAs.",

    "abstract": "Venous ulcers are a major health problem because of their high prevalence and associated high cost of care. Compression therapy is the most widely used treatment for this condition. The vast majority of published articles on compression therapy present the results in the treatment of venous ulcers usually up to 15 to 20 cm(2). However, there are no published data in English medical literature on the efficacy of compression therapy in the treatment of extensive venous ulcers (ulcers >20 cm(2) of more than 6 months' duration) with regard to healing rate, time to healing, and recurrence rate at 12 months after healing.\nA total of 138 patients with extensive venous ulceration (ulceration surface, 20-210 cm(2); duration, 7 months to 28 years) were randomized into 2 groups: (1) a treatment group (72 patients who were treated by using a multilayer bandaging system with the Tubulcus (a heelless open-toed elastic compression device knitted in tubular form) and elastic bandages and (2) a control group (66 patients treated with a multilayer bandaging system with elastic bandages only). The patients were treated on an ambulatory basis; the primary end point of the study was complete ulcer healing at 500 days. The secondary end point was to assess the ulcer recurrence rate during continuation of below-knee compression of different degrees of compression. In the treatment group, patients were instructed to continue to wear the Tubulcus (35 mm Hg), and patients in the control group were instructed to wear compression stockings with compression of 20 to 25 mm Hg. The exclusion criteria from the study were heart insufficiency with an ejection fraction <35, an ankle-brachial pressure index less than 0.8, and pregnancy.\nThe cumulative healing rate was 93% in the treatment group and was 51% in the control group (P < .001). The median healing time in the treatment group was 133 days (range, 28 to 464 days), and in the control group it was 211 days (range, 61 to 438 days). The recurrence rate at 12 months in the treatment group was 24% (16/67) and was 53% (18/34) in the control group (P < .05). After additional compression treatment with the same treatment protocol, all 16 recurrent ulcers in the treatment group healed. In the control group, the healing rate of recurrent ulcers was 89% (16/18).\nThis study suggests that for extensive venous ulceration, multilayer compression therapy with the Tubulcus provides an extremely high healing rate. Compression of more than 30 mm Hg results in decreased ulcer recurrence. However, recurrence cannot be completely avoided.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and associated comorbidities are associated with a high rate of complications and technical difficulties after a number of surgical procedures. We studied the role of obesity in outcomes in lower extremity arterial revascularization.\nWe reviewed all lower extremity arterial revascularizations performed at our institution in 2000. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2) defined obesity. Perioperative outcomes, long-term survival, and graft patency were evaluated in obese and nonobese patients by using linear regression, the Fisher exact test, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nThe study population consisted of 74 (26%) obese and 207 (74%) nonobese patients. Patient demographics of the obese and nonobese populations were similar. The mean BMI for obese patients was 35 +/- 5 kg/m(2) and in nonobese patients was 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2). The mean age of each group was 67 +/- 10 years (BMI > or =30 kg/m(2)) and 70 +/- 13 years (BMI <30 kg/m(2)). There were 45 (61%) obese men and 29 (39%) obese women. There were 128 (62%) nonobese men and 79 (38%) nonobese women. Diabetes was present in 76% of the obese and 70% of the nonobese patients. Perioperative myocardial infarction, 30-day mortality, and rate of reoperation within 30 days were not significantly different. Obese patients had higher increased postoperative wound infection rates (16% vs 7%; P = .04). Survival analysis showed 81% +/- 5% and 85% +/- 3% 1-year survival and 66% +/- 6% and 62% +/- 3% 3-year survival in obese and nonobese patients (P = .58), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no effect of obesity on long-term graft patency, with 1-year graft patency rates of 82% +/- 6% and 81% +/- 4% in obese and nonobese patients, respectively (P = .79).\nObese patients have similar limb salvage rates, perioperative cardiac morbidity, long-term survival rates, and long-term graft patency but have increased perioperative wound infections.",

    "results": "The study population consisted of 74 (26%) obese and 207 (74%) nonobese patients. Patient demographics of the obese and nonobese populations were similar. The mean BMI for obese patients was 35 +/- 5 kg/m(2) and in nonobese patients was 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2). The mean age of each group was 67 +/- 10 years (BMI > or =30 kg/m(2)) and 70 +/- 13 years (BMI <30 kg/m(2)). There were 45 (61%) obese men and 29 (39%) obese women. There were 128 (62%) nonobese men and 79 (38%) nonobese women. Diabetes was present in 76% of the obese and 70% of the nonobese patients. Perioperative myocardial infarction, 30-day mortality, and rate of reoperation within 30 days were not significantly different. Obese patients had higher increased postoperative wound infection rates (16% vs 7%; P = .04). Survival analysis showed 81% +/- 5% and 85% +/- 3% 1-year survival and 66% +/- 6% and 62% +/- 3% 3-year survival in obese and nonobese patients (P = .58), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no effect of obesity on long-term graft patency, with 1-year graft patency rates of 82% +/- 6% and 81% +/- 4% in obese and nonobese patients, respectively (P = .79).",

    "abstract": "To validate the use of fluoroscopic roentgenographic stereophotogrammetric analysis (FRSA) for its feasibility and accuracy for measuring the three-dimensional dynamic motion of stent grafts.\nA digital biplane fluoroscopy setup was calibrated (Siemens Axiom Artis dBc). Stereo images were acquired of a static aortic model with a stent graft in different axial positions, imposed by a micromanipulator. The three-dimensional measurement error of FRSA was determined by comparing FRSA measurements with the micromanipulator. An aortic model with a stent graft was constructed and connected to an artificial circulation with a physiological flow and pressure profile. Markers were added to the spine (tantalum spherical markers; diameter 1 mm) and stent (welding tin; diameter 1 mm). The three-dimensional measurement precision was determined by measuring the position of a single (stable) spine marker during two pulsatile cycles. Finally, three-dimensional stent marker motion was analyzed with a frame rate of 30 images per second, including three-dimensional marker position (change), diameter change, and center of circle position change.\nThe mean error of FRSA measurement of displacement was 0.003 mm (SD, 0.019 mm; maximum error, 0.058 mm). A very high precision of position measurement was found (SD, 0.009-0.015 mm). During pulsatile motion, the position (changes) of the markers could be assessed in the x, y, and z directions, as well as the stent diameter change and center of circle position change.\nFRSA has proven to be a method with very high accuracy and temporal resolution to measure three-dimensional stent-graft motion in a pulsatile environment. This technique has the potential to contribute significantly to the knowledge of stent-graft behavior after endovascular aneurysm repair and improvements in stent-graft design. The technique is ready for clinical testing.",

Contractions caused by histamine were associated with an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a Ca(2+)-independent signalling pathway. The latter pathway involved mechanisms sensitive to protein kinase C, myosin light chain kinase, and Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitors. The regulation of contraction induced by Provinols shows that treatment of arterial TEVM with this compound significantly decreased histamine-induced contraction. This effect was associated with the inhibition of the Rho-associated protein kinase pathway and the decrease in alpha-smooth muscle actin expression.\nThe use of arterial TEVM, brings new insights into the mechanisms by which polyphenols regulate vascular contraction in the human artery.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular occlusion of the celiac artery can be performed along with occlusion of a celiac trunk aneurysm or stenting of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm to prevent a type II endoleak. Because only a few individual cases have been previously available for study, the aim of this study was to examine the technical details, clinical course, and outcome of this procedure based on a group of patients.\nThis retrospective study included 10 patients who underwent endovascular occlusion of the celiac artery between 1998 and 2006 (female/male = 1:4, mean age, 62.5 +/- 9.8 years). There were five aneurysms of the celiac artery, two cases each of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and dissecting thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, and one mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the aorta. The mean follow-up period was 21.4 +/- 29.1 months.\nThe celiac artery was successfully occluded in all cases, along with exclusion of the celiac artery aneurysm or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, respectively. The pancreaticoduodenal arteries were the main collateral pathways, but other anastomoses and, especially, vascular variations of the celiac artery and its territory were also significant. In one patient, abdominal angina was treated by percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the superior mesenteric artery.\nEndovascular occlusion of the celiac artery is both safe and feasible. Some vascular variations may make occlusion of the celiac trunk impossible. Liver function disorder is a relative contraindication for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with the development of a procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state. Tissue factor (TF) and its naturally occurring inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), play a central role in the initiation and progression of such a hypercoagulable state, but their role in patients undergoing open AAA repair has not previously been examined.\nA prospective study was conducted of 17 patients undergoing elective AAA repair and 10 patients undergoing emergency AAA repair. Blood was taken before induction, and 5 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours after aortic cross-clamp release and assayed for plasma TF, TFPI, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activities.\nTF activity was significantly higher at all time points in patients with ruptured AAA compared with nonruptured AAA. The median (interquartile range, IRQ) TF activity (AU/mL) was 9.9 vs 3.2 (IRQ, 5.9 to 12.6 vs 2.0 to 7.6; P = .005) at preinduction; 10.7 vs 1.5 (IRQ, 9.2 to 18.3 vs 0.1 to 6.6; P = .003) at 5 minutes after clamp release; 9.5 vs 3.3 (IRQ, 7.0 to 13.5 vs 1.0 to 7.9; P = .013) at 24 hours, and 9.6 vs 3.9 (IRQ, 7.6 to 12.6 vs 2.4 to 8.7; P = .006) at 48 hours. TFPI levels were not significantly different between ruptured AAA and nonruptured AAA before or during operation but became significantly elevated at 24 and 48 hours in patients who had undergone repair of ruptured AAA. Ruptured AAA repair was associated with a hypofibrinolytic state compared with nonruptured AAA.\nThe present study has demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that ruptured AAA is associated with significantly higher perioperative levels of circulating TF compared with nonruptured AAA. Furthermore, in the immediate perioperative period, the high levels of TF are not associated with a corresponding rise in TFPI levels, indicating an unopposed prothrombotic state. Direct inhibition of TF by administration of anti-TF antibodies or recombinant TFPI remains to be evaluated in subjects presenting with hemorrhage due to ruptured AAA, but if given early enough, it may attenuate the early deleterious effects of unopposed TF expression and ultimately contribute to improved outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cutting balloon angioplasty in the treatment of infrainguinal vein bypass graft stenosis.\nData from a prospective database, supplemented by chart review, were obtained on all patients who underwent cutting balloon angioplasty of lower extremity vein bypass grafts at a single institution during a 4-year period. Noninvasive duplex ultrasound imaging of grafts, along with measurement of ankle-brachial indices and digital pressures, was performed on all patients before and after treatment with the cutting balloon. Efficacy of cutting balloon angioplasty and procedural complications were analyzed. Data from noninvasive vascular testing were compared using the two-tailed paired Student t test. Patency rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in patency rates were compared using the log-rank test.\nFrom July 2002 to February 2006, 109 cutting balloon angioplasties were performed on 70 bypasses in 61 patients. There were 12 complications in 109 procedures (11%), only one of which required immediate operative intervention. Initial technical success was 96%. Noninvasive vascular testing indicators significantly improved immediately after intervention: peak systolic graft velocity decreased from 360 +/- 158 cm/s to 143 +/- 67 cm/s (P < .001), ankle-brachial index improved from 0.55 +/- 0.3 to 0.85 +/- 0.2 (P < .001), and digital pressure increased from 31 +/- 30 mm Hg to 62 +/- 32 mm Hg (P < .001). Patency rates at 6 months according to the Kaplan-Meier method were primary patency, 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.60); assisted primary patency, 72% (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.83); and secondary patency, 99% (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.00). At 6 months, cumulative limb salvage was 94% (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.00).\nCutting balloon angioplasty of infrainguinal vein bypass graft stenosis is technically feasible but is associated with a relatively high complication rate and a relatively low short-term patency rate.",

There were 12 complications in 109 procedures (11%), only one of which required immediate operative intervention. Initial technical success was 96%. Noninvasive vascular testing indicators significantly improved immediately after intervention: peak systolic graft velocity decreased from 360 +/- 158 cm/s to 143 +/- 67 cm/s (P < .001), ankle-brachial index improved from 0.55 +/- 0.3 to 0.85 +/- 0.2 (P < .001), and digital pressure increased from 31 +/- 30 mm Hg to 62 +/- 32 mm Hg (P < .001). Patency rates at 6 months according to the Kaplan-Meier method were primary patency, 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.60); assisted primary patency, 72% (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.83); and secondary patency, 99% (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.00). At 6 months, cumulative limb salvage was 94% (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.00).",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of renal artery stenosis (RAS) among patients referred to a vascular laboratory in a university hospital, to identify those who are possible candidates for revascularization, and to determine the prevalence of other pathologies incidentally detected.\nConsecutive patients referred to our laboratory for exclusion of RAS were included. Color duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging of the abdominal aorta, renal vasculature, and kidney parenchyma was performed. The resistivity index of the kidney (RI) was measured, and 0.8 was used as a cutoff to identify those with severe kidney disease that could be excluded from an intervention. Incidental findings were also noted.\nA total of 324 patients were included from September 1998 to August 2003. Unilateral RAS was found in 14% and bilateral in 7%. Unilateral (1.5%) and bilateral (0.6%) renal artery occlusions were rare. The main reason for referral was uncontrolled (43%) and controlled hypertension (34%). Most patients (63%) were taking two or more antihypertensive drugs. The diagnostic yield was 22% among those using two drugs and 55% among those using three or more. In 46 patients (64%), the RI was <0.8. Seven cases of fibromuscular dysplasia were found (10% of RAS patients or 2% overall). Incidental findings were detected in 24% and were significant enough to alter management in 26% among those with such findings.\nOur study identified a RAS prevalence of 22% and a renal artery occlusion prevalence of 4%. There was a high yield for RAS in patients receiving three or more drugs; however, the yield was also significant among those receiving two or more. About two thirds of patients diagnosed with RAS were potential revascularization candidates, evidenced by a low RI. DU imaging is also very useful in detecting pathology that is significant to alter patients' management.",

    "abstract": "This study reviewed outcomes of patients requiring surgical conversion after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nRecords for all patients undergoing open conversion after endovascular AAA repair were reviewed.\nFrom 1993 to 2006, 574 patients underwent endovascular repair for AAA. Seventeen patients, including three patients who underwent prior endovascular repair at other centers, required surgical conversion with complete (n = 9) or partial graft removal (n = 8). Five patients required immediate conversion (acute), and 12 underwent delayed conversion 4 to 72 months after endovascular repair. Indications for acute conversion were large type I endoleak (n = 3, 60%), including one patient with graft migration, and retroperitoneal bleeding (n = 2, 40%). Indications for chronic conversion were endoleak with increasing aneurysm size (n = 9, 75%), stent fracture without endoleak (n = 1, 8%), delayed retroperitoneal bleeding (n = 1, 8%), and infection (n = 1, 8%). Suprarenal aortic cross-clamping was required in two patients (12%), and endograft components were retained in eight (47%). An aortic occlusion balloon placed through the body of the existing endograft facilitated proximal control in three patients. There were two perioperative deaths in the acute conversion group (2/5; 40%) and none in the delayed conversion group (P = .04). Five-year actuarial survival was 71.9%. Mean follow-up was 41.6 +/- 32.2 months. Retained endovascular components in patients with partial graft removal remained stable during follow-up.\nSurgical conversion after endovascular AAA repair can be performed without suprarenal clamping in most patients. Endovascular aortic control with a balloon avoids suprarenal exposure. Partial endograft removal in selected patients facilitates open conversion and appears durable. Acute conversion is associated with increased mortality.",

    "abstract": "To review the treatment of blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BAI) at a single institution over the past 12 years and compare pre-, peri-, and postoperative variables and outcomes of both open (OR) and thoracic endovascular (TEVAR) repair of these injuries.\nAll cases of confirmed BAI from 1994 to present were included in this retrospective review. Data collected included demographic data, injury severity score, Glasgow coma score, arrival hemodynamic variables, and associated injuries. Operative data included: type of procedure (OR or TEVAR), duration of procedure, need for and amount of blood transfused, use of anticoagulation, type of anesthesia, and service performing the procedure. Outcomes evaluated were: death, paraplegia, length of stay, days ventilated, and procedure related complications. Specific to EVAR; access, stent graft type and number, presence of endoleak and long-term clinical and radiologic follow-up were evaluated.\nThirty cases of blunt thoracic aortic injury were identified. Two patients received no treatment and died, 28 patients were treated (OR 16, TEVAR 12) and included for comparison. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to preoperative variables with the exception of significantly more associated intra-abdominal injuries in the TEVAR group (P = .03). Five patients in the OR group (31.2%) died in the perioperative period. There were no deaths in the TEVAR group (P =.05). One OR patient (6.25%) suffered postoperative paraplegia. No paraplegia occurred in the TEVAR group. Intraoperative variables were similar between groups with the exception of mean units of blood transfused (OR 8.5 units, vs TEVAR 0.2 units, P = .002). Ten patients in the OR group either died or had a procedure related complication compared with none in the TEVAR group (P = .001). There was no difference in length of stay or length of mechanical ventilation between the groups. There were no procedure or device related complications in the TEVAR group during follow-up (mean 15.3 months, range 1 to 53.5 months).\nEndovascular repair of BAI results in significantly less combined mortality and morbidity when compared to OR. Significantly less blood is needed intraoperatively in the TEVAR group. No complications from stent graft insertion have been observed during follow-up. Endovascular repair is replacing open repair as the treatment of choice for BAI at our institution.",

    "abstract": "Anemia is a common comorbid condition in various inflammatory states and an established predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and end-stage renal disease. The present study of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) undergoing endovascular repair (EVAR) assessed the relationships between baseline hemoglobin concentration and AAA size, as well as anemia and long-term survival.\nBetween March 1994 and November 2006, 711 patients (65 women, mean age 75.8 +/- 7.8 years) underwent elective EVAR. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. Post-EVAR mean follow-up was 48.3 +/- 32.0 months. Association of hemoglobin level with AAA size was assessed with multiple linear regression. Mortality was determined with use of the internet-based Social Security Death Index and the electronic hospital record. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of anemic and nonanemic patient groups were compared by the log-rank method. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of anemia on vital status after EVAR.\nA total of 218/711 (30.7%) of AAA patients undergoing EVAR had anemia at baseline. After adjustment for various risk factors, hemoglobin level was inversely related to maximum AAA diameter (beta: - .144, 95%-CI: -1.482 - .322, P = .002). Post-EVAR survival was 65.5% at 5 years and 44.4% at 10 years. In long-term follow-up, survival was significantly lower in patients with anemia as compared to patients without anemia (P < .0001 by log-rank). Baseline hemoglobin levels were independently related to long-term mortality in multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for various risk factors (adjusted HR: 0.866, 95% CI: .783 to .958, P = .005). Within this model, statin use (adjusted HR: .517, 95% CI: .308 to .868, P = .013) was independently related to long-term survival, whereas baseline AAA diameter (adjusted HR: 1.022, 95% CI: 1.009 to 1.036, P = .001) was an independently associated with increased mortality.\nBaseline hemoglobin concentration is independently associated with AAA size and reduced long-term survival following EVAR. Thus, the presence or absence of anemia offers a potential refinement of existing risk stratification instruments.",

The size of the patient population was calculated to allow detection of a possible 20% difference in patency in favor of direct bypass with a one-sided alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.10. Patients underwent yearly follow-up examinations using color flow duplex scanning with ankle-brachial systolic pressure index measurement. Digital angiography was performed if hemodynamic abnormalities were noted. Median follow-up was 7.4 years. Primary endpoints were primary patency and assisted primary patency estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence interval. Secondary endpoints were secondary patency and postoperative mortality and morbidity.\nCardiovascular risk factors, preoperative symptoms, iliac lesions TASC class (C in 87 [61%] patients and D in 56 [39%] patients), and superficial femoral artery (SFA) run-off were comparable in the two treatment groups. One patient in the direct bypass group died postoperatively. Primary patency at 5 years was higher in the direct bypass group than in the crossover bypass group (92.7 +/- 6.1% vs 73.2 +/- 10%, P = .001). Assisted primary patency and secondary patency at 5 years were also higher after direct bypass than crossover bypass (92.7 +/- 6.1% vs 84.3 +/- 8.5%, P = .04 and 97.0 +/- 3.0% vs 89.8 +/- 7.1%, P = .03, respectively). Patency at 5 years after crossover bypass was significantly higher in patients presenting no or low-grade SFA stenosis than in patients presenting high-grade (> or =50%) stenosis or occlusion of the SFA (74.0 +/- 12% vs 62.5 +/- 19%, P = .04). In both treatment groups, patency was comparable using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyester grafts. Overall survival was 59.5 +/- 12% at 10 years.\nThis study showed that late patency was higher after direct bypass than crossover bypass in good-risk patients with unilateral iliac occlusive disease not amenable to angioplasty.

In both treatment groups, patency was comparable using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyester grafts. Overall survival was 59.5 +/- 12% at 10 years.",

    "abstract": "Stent grafting has become the first-line approach to traumatic thoracic aortic transections (TTAT) in some trauma centers due to a perceived decrease in morbidity and mortality compared with standard open repair. We reviewed contemporary outcomes of patients undergoing endovascular repair of TTAT (endoTTAT) and those undergoing open repair (openTTAT) to determine if current reported results support first-line use of endoTTAT.\nRetrospective, nonrandomized studies published in English (>5 cases/report) involving TTAT listed in PubMed between 2001 and 2006 were systematically reviewed. Periprocedural outcomes between endoTTAT and openTTAT were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 22.9 months for endoTTAT (reported for 22 of 28 studies) and 48.6 months for openTTAT (reported for 5 of 12 studies). For statistical analysis, t tests were used.\nWe analyzed 33 articles reporting 699 procedures in which 370 patients treated with endoTTAT and 329 patients managed with openTTAT. No statistical differences were found between patient groups in mean age (41.3 vs 38.8 years, P < .10), injury severity score (39.8 vs 36.0, P < .10), or technical success rates of the procedure (96.5% vs 98.5%, P = .58). In contrast, mortality was significantly lower in the endoTTAT group (7.6% vs 15.2%, P = .0076) as were rates of paraplegia (0% vs 5.6%, P < .0001) and stroke (0.85% vs 5.3%, P = .0028). The most common procedure-related complications for each technique were iliac artery injury during endoTTAT and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury after openTTAT.\nTo our knowledge, no large multicenter prospective randomized trial comparing endoTTAT and openTTAT has been published in the literature. This meta-analysis of pooled data serves as a surrogate, demonstrating a significant reduction in mortality, paraplegia, and stroke rates in patients who undergo endoTTAT; however, the long-term durability of endoTTAT remains in question.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the role of multibranched stent grafts for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair.\nSelf-expanding covered stents were used to connect the caudally directed cuffs of an aortic stent graft with the visceral branches of a TAAA in 22 patients (16 men, 6 women) with a mean age of 76 +/- 7 years. All patients were unfit for open repair, and nine had undergone prior aortic surgery. Customized aortic stent grafts were inserted through surgically exposed femoral (n = 16) or iliac (n = 6) arteries. Covered stents were inserted through surgically exposed brachial arteries. Spinal catheters were used for cerebrospinal fluid pressure drainage in 22 patients and for and spinal anesthesia in 11.\nAll 22 stent grafts and all 81 branches were deployed successfully. Aortic coverage as a percentage of subclavian-to-bifurcation distance was 69% +/- 20%. Mean contrast volume was 203 mL, mean blood loss was 714 mL, and mean hospital stay was 10.9 days. Two patients (9.1%) died perioperatively: one from guidewire injury to a renal arterial branch and the other from a medication error. Serious or potentially serious complications occurred in 9 of 22 patients (41%). There was no paraplegia, renal failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction among the 20 surviving patients. Two patients (9.1%) underwent successful reintervention: one for localized intimal disruption and the other for aortic dissection, type I endoleak, and stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery. One patient has a type II endoleak. Follow-up is >1 month in 19 patients, >6 months in 12, and >12 months in 8. One branch (renal artery) occluded for a 98.75% branch patency rate at 1 month. The other 80 branches remain patent. There are no signs of stent graft migration, component separation, or fracture.\nMultibranched stent graft implantation eliminates aneurysm flow, preserves visceral perfusion, and avoids many of the physiologic stresses associated with other forms of repair. The results support an expanded role for this technique in the treatment of TAAA.",

Yet a growing body of evidence suggests that, in this subset of DVT patients, a treatment strategy that includes thrombus removal plus optimal anticoagulation significantly improves outcomes.

Type IV popliteal entrapment by a fibrous band independent of the gastrocnemius muscle was diagnosed during surgery and divided. Early detection of popliteal entrapment is highly important to prevent the development of this serious complication.",

It has a single-action deployment mechanism, similar to its abdominal counterpart, consisting of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene string, which is used to constrain the self-expanding stent graft within an integral external expanded polytetrafluoroethylene corset. This report describes two cases of deployment failure of the TAG device and the bailout techniques used to correct the problem and complete the procedure. In one case, this complication resulted in a devastating intraoperative stroke that led to the death of the patient. Although this is an extremely rare occurrence, the rapid recognition of the problem and ability to correct it by using catheter-based techniques are important during endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic diseases using the TAG device.",

    "abstract": "Patients requiring access for hemodialysis in whom radiocephalic or brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas cannot be formed or have failed present a significant clinical challenge. We compare outcomes in patients undergoing transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistulas (BBAVF) with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene brachioaxillary access grafts in a single European center.\nWe identified all patients undergoing a first upper limb tertiary-access procedure-that is, either BBAVF or brachioaxillary access graft for hemodialysis-between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005. The median follow-up was 18.1 months (interquartile range, 8.7-34.9 months). Successful use for dialysis, primary patency, secondary patency, and patient survival was assessed.\nA total of 185 patients were identified; 71 had a BBAVF, and 114 had an access graft. The median age was 64.3 years (interquartile range, 50.7-74.4 years). The groups were well matched for age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and number of prior access procedures. Significantly fewer BBAVFs were successfully used for dialysis: 69.0% BBAVFs compared with 89.4% access grafts (P = .001; chi(2)). One- and two-year primary patency rates were 45.3% and 40.0%, respectively, for BBAVF and were 56.4% and 43.2% for access grafts (P = .579; log rank). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in secondary patency between the two procedures (P = .868; log rank). We found that surgeons in training had no influence on the primary patency of either BBAVF or access grafts. However, infective complications necessitating an operation were significantly higher in the access graft group (6.2% vs 0%; P = .031; Fisher exact test).\nAlthough more difficult to establish, BBAVFs provide patency at least equivalent to that of brachioaxillary access grafts. However, infective complications are fewer in the BBAVF group. As such, we believe that BBAVF should be the first choice of the vascular access surgeon when fistulas using the cephalic vein are not possible or have failed.",

    "abstract": "The goal was to create a simple diagnostic scoring system able to differentiate leg symptoms related to chronic venous disorders (CVD) from those produced by other causes.\nA prospective observational study was done of ambulatory or hospitalized patients from 13 private and five institutional vascular centers. Two groups of patients with leg symptoms were investigated. The CVD-positive (CVD+) patients had clinically documented CVD and significant venous reflux at duplex ultrasound examination, but no arterial, rheumatologic, or neurologic disorders. The CVD-negative (CVD-) patients had disorders of an arterial, rheumatic, or neurologic origin but no clinical or duplex ultrasound signs of CVD. Patients completed a 54-item questionnaire characterizing their symptoms. Items of the diagnostic score were selected as those associated with the highest likelihood ratio (LR) for CVD in a first series of patients. They were combined into a few criteria, the number of which, when validated in a patient, would produce the value of the score for this patient. Selection of the most relevant score was performed through the comparison of the surface area under receiver operating characteristic curves. The construct validity of this score was evaluated through a factor analysis. The diagnostic performance of the scoring system was evaluated in a second series of patients similar to the first series.\nIn the construction phase, 123 CVD+ patients and 94 CVD- patients were enrolled. The validation series consisted of 92 patients (67 venous and 25 nonvenous). The most efficient scoring system was composed of four combined criteria: sensation of heavy or swollen legs (sensitivity, 0.82; specificity, 0.55; LR, 1.84); associated with itching, impatient legs, or phlebalgia (sensitivity, 0.55; specificity, 0.92; LR, 6.41); worsened by a hot environment or improved by a cold environment (sensitivity, 0.78; specificity, 0.71; LR, 2.72); not worsened by walking (sensitivity, 0.89; specificity, 0.62; LR, 2.33). The score was calculated as the number (0 to 4) of the above criteria validated by the patient, with a threshold level of >3, it was shown to have a high specificity (0.95) and a fair sensitivity (0.75) for CVD. Factor analysis showed the construct validity of the score, and consistent results were found in the validation series.\nThe clinical relevance of this scoring system remains to be evaluated prospectively in standard clinical conditions. However, these results already document that venous symptoms can be differentiated from leg symptoms of other origins.",

    "results": "In the construction phase, 123 CVD+ patients and 94 CVD- patients were enrolled. The validation series consisted of 92 patients (67 venous and 25 nonvenous). The most efficient scoring system was composed of four combined criteria: sensation of heavy or swollen legs (sensitivity, 0.82; specificity, 0.55; LR, 1.84); associated with itching, impatient legs, or phlebalgia (sensitivity, 0.55; specificity, 0.92; LR, 6.41); worsened by a hot environment or improved by a cold environment (sensitivity, 0.78; specificity, 0.71; LR, 2.72); not worsened by walking (sensitivity, 0.89; specificity, 0.62; LR, 2.33). The score was calculated as the number (0 to 4) of the above criteria validated by the patient, with a threshold level of >3, it was shown to have a high specificity (0.95) and a fair sensitivity (0.75) for CVD. Factor analysis showed the construct validity of the score, and consistent results were found in the validation series.",

    "abstract": "Stenting of chronic nonmalignant obstruction in the venous outflow tract started in earnest in 1997. Data sets are now available to perform long-term analysis of stent-related outcome and clinical and hemodynamic results of this intervention.\nFrom 1997 to 2005, 982 chronic nonmalignant obstructive lesions of the femoroiliocaval vein were stented under intravascular ultrasound guidance. Median patient age was 54 years (range, 14 to 90 years), the female/male was 2.6:1, and left/right limb symptoms, 2.4:1. Clinical score of CEAP was 2 in 7%, 3 in 47%, 4 in 24%, 5 in 5%, and 6 in 17%; primary/secondary etiology was 518:464. Stent-related outcome (morbidity, thrombotic events, patency, in-stent recurrent stenosis), clinical outcome, quality of life (QOL) as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ), and hemodynamics were evaluated before and after intervention.\nMonitoring for 94% of patients lasted a mean 22 months (range, 1 to 107 months). Stenting was performed with no mortality (<30 days) and low morbidity. Thrombotic events were rare (1.5%) during the postoperative period (<30 days) and during later follow-up (3%). At 72 months, primary, assisted-primary, and secondary cumulative patency rates were 79%, 100%, and 100% in nonthrombotic disease and 57%, 80%, and 86% in thrombotic disease, respectively. Cumulative rate of severe in-stent restenosis (>50%) occurred in 5% of limbs at 72 months (10% in thrombotic limbs, 1% in nonthrombotic limbs). The main risk factors associated with stent occlusion were the presence and severity of thrombotic disease; thrombophilia by itself was not a risk factor. The median pain score and degree of swelling decreased significantly poststent. Severe leg pain (visual analogue scale >5) and leg swelling (grade 3) decreased from 54% and 44% prestent to 11% and 18% poststent, respectively. At 5 years, cumulative rates of complete relief of pain and swelling were 62% and 32%, respectively, and ulcer healing was 58%. The mean CIVIQ scores of QOL improved significantly in all categories. Mean hand-foot pressure differential decreased and mean ambulatory venous pressure improved in stented limbs with no concomitant reflux. The hemodynamic response was modified, depending on the presence of deep and superficial reflux in subsets of patients with adjunct saphenous procedures. No increase in venous reflux was observed.\nVenous stenting can be performed with low morbidity and mortality, long-term high patency rate, and a low rate of in-stent restenosis. It resulted in major symptom relief in patients with chronic venous disease, which was not consistently reflected in any substantial hemodynamic improvement by conventional measurements. The beneficial clinical outcome occurred regardless of presence of remaining reflux, adjunct saphenous procedures, or etiology of obstruction.",

    "abstract": "The Hispanic population represents the fastest growing minority in the United States. As the population grows and ages, the vascular surgery community will be providing increasing amounts of care to this diverse group. To appropriately administer preventive and therapeutic care, it is important to understand the incidence, risk factors, and natural history of vascular disease in Hispanic patients.\nWe analyzed hospital discharge databases from New York and Florida to determine the rate of lower extremity revascularization (LER), carotid revascularization (CR), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in Hispanics relative to the general population. The rates of common comorbidities, the indications for the procedures, and outcomes during the same hospitalization as the index procedure were determined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the differences between Hispanics and white non-Hispanics with respect to rate of procedure, symptoms at presentation, and outcome after procedure. Demographic variables and length of stay were also analyzed.\nThe rate of LER, CR, and AAA repair was significantly lower in Hispanic patients than in white non-Hispanics. Despite this lower rate of intervention, Hispanics were significantly more likely than whites to present with limb-threatening lower extremity ischemia (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91 to 2.29), symptomatic carotid artery disease (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.75), and ruptured AAA (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52) than white non-Hispanics These differences were maintained after controlling for the presence of diabetes mellitus and other comorbidities. Hispanic patients had higher rates of amputation during the same hospitalization after LER (6.2% vs 3.4%, P < .0001) and higher mortality after elective AAA repair (5% vs 3.4%, P = .0032). Length of stay after LER, CR, and AAA repair was longer for Hispanic patients than white non-Hispanics.\nSignificant disparities in the rate of utilization of three common vascular surgical procedures exist between Hispanic patients and the general population. In addition, Hispanics appear to present with more advanced disease and have worse outcomes in some cases. Reasons for these disparities must be determined to improve these results in the fastest growing segment of our society.",

    "abstract": "Although aggressive endoluminal therapy for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease is commonplace, the implications of diabetes mellitus (DM) on long-term outcomes in this population are unclear. We examined the consequences of endovascular treatment of the SFA in patients with and without DM.\nA database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA between 1986 and 2005 was maintained. Three groups were defined: nondiabetic patients, those with non-insulin-dependent DM (NIDDM), and those with insulin-dependent DM (IDDM). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results were standardized to TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) and Society for Vascular Surgery criteria. Time-dependent outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Factor analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model for time-dependent variables. Data are presented as mean +/- SD where appropriate.\nEndovascular treatment (ie, balloon angioplasty +/- adjuvant stenting in 38%) was initiated in 525 limbs in 437 patients (68% male; average age, 66 +/- 14 years) for claudication failing conservative therapy or chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI). Of these, 50% were nondiabetic, 26% had NIDDM, and 24% had IDDM. Analyses were separated by those presenting with claudication (61%) and those presenting with CLI (39%). Among patients presenting with claudication, those with IDDM had significantly lower assisted primary patency (P < .01) and a higher incidence of restenosis (P = .04). Patencies at 3 years for nondiabetic, NIDDM, and IDDM were 62%, 72%, and 54% (primary), and 81%, 86%, and 65% (assisted primary), respectively. Patency and restenosis rates were associated with lesion calcification, TASC D lesion categorization, and acute periprocedural occlusion. Among patients presenting with CLI, patency and restenosis rates were equivalent across all groups; however, limb salvage was significantly worse for both groups of diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic (NIDDM, P = .01; IDDM, P = .02). Reduction in limb salvage rates was associated with presence of tissue loss at presentation, end-stage renal disease, and progression of distal disease on follow-up.\nEndoluminal therapy for SFA occlusive disease yields lower assisted patency rates and higher restenosis rates for those patients presenting with claudication who have more advanced diabetes (ie, IDDM). Among those patients presenting with CLI, particularly those with tissue loss, limb salvage rates are lowered for the diabetic groups (NIDDM and IDDM) despite equivalent patency and restenosis rates.",

Endovascular therapy is a less invasive treatment modality that may potentially improve patient outcomes. We reviewed our experience with patients who sustained blunt thoracic aortic injuries distal to the left subclavian artery and presented for open surgical or endovascular repair.\nBetween August 1993 and August 2006, 62 patients sustained blunt thoracic aortic injuries distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and proceeded to undergo open surgical (n = 48, 77%), or endovascular repair (n = 14, 23%). Revised trauma score (RTS), injury severity score (ISS), new injury severity score (NISS), individual associated traumatic injuries, as well as operative and postoperative outcomes were compared between open surgical and endovascular groups.\nAge, gender, race, and mechanism of injury did not differ between open surgical and endovascular groups. Additionally, RTS, ISS, and NISS values were not significantly different. The proportion of patients with sternal fractures (14% vs 0%), or unstable spinal fractures (36% vs 10%) was significantly greater in the endovascular group. Of the patients who received endografts, 93% (n = 13) were evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgeon and assessed to be prohibitive to operative intervention. Endografts utilized included commercially manufactured thoracic endografts (n = 6; 43%) and abdominal aortic endograft components (n = 8; 57%). Forty-one interposition grafts were placed in the open surgical group. Renal complications (32% vs 7%), and urinary tract infections (35% vs 7%) approached significance between surgical and endovascular groups (P = .082 and P = .077, respectively). Intraoperative mortality for the surgical and endovascular groups was 23% and 0%, respectively (P = .056). Endovascular repair was associated with significant reductions in operative time (118 vs 209 minutes), estimated blood loss (77 vs 3180 ml), and intraoperative blood transfusions (0.9 vs 6.1 units). No endoleaks were detected during a mean follow-up of 9.4 months in the endovascular group.\nEndovascular repair of blunt descending thoracic aortic injuries utilizing thoracic or abdominal endographs is a technically feasible modality that is at least equivalent to open therapy in the short term and associated with a lower intraoperative mortality (P = .056).

    "abstract": "Traumatic transection of the thoracic aorta is a highly morbid injury. Treatment may be delayed while attention focuses on concomitant injuries. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is effective but remains controversial in these often-young patients. We reviewed our experience in acute and subacute treatment of these injuries with TEVAR.\nA retrospective analysis of five men and five women who underwent TEVAR for aortic transection from 1999 to 2007 was conducted. Procedures were performed with standard endovascular techniques. Follow-up included computed tomography at 1 month and yearly thereafter.\nMean age was 44 years (range, 20 to 84 years). Motor vehicle accidents accounted for 7 injuries, a snowmobile accident for 1, skydiving for 1, and balloon angioplasty of a coarctation for 1. Average diameter of the proximal landing zone was 25 mm (range, 23 to 29 mm). Mean external iliac size was 10 mm (range, 7 to 15 mm), and no conduits were required. Immediate technical success was 90%, with no 30-day mortality. Seven patients underwent repair acutely (< or =24 hours) and three patients subacutely (range, 4 days to 2 months) for pseudoaneurysm. Four patients had procedures for concomitant injuries before their transection was repaired (3 laparotomies and a fixation for open fracture). One endoleak was noted, which resolved by the 1-month follow-up. The lone device-related complication was an endograft collapse at 5 months managed by repeat endografting, which was complicated by aortoesophageal fistula requiring esophagectomy and open reconstruction. No iliac injuries occurred. At 20-months of mean follow-up (range, 2 to 70 months), all patients are alive and well.\nTEVAR for traumatic aortic transection is feasible, with good initial success. Repair can be delayed in selected cases. Continued surveillance is necessary to ensure good long-term outcomes in these young patients. Care must be taken when performing TEVAR for this off-label indication because these devices are designed for the larger aortic diameters of aneurysm patients.",

Average diameter of the proximal landing zone was 25 mm (range, 23 to 29 mm). Mean external iliac size was 10 mm (range, 7 to 15 mm), and no conduits were required. Immediate technical success was 90%, with no 30-day mortality. Seven patients underwent repair acutely (< or =24 hours) and three patients subacutely (range, 4 days to 2 months) for pseudoaneurysm. Four patients had procedures for concomitant injuries before their transection was repaired (3 laparotomies and a fixation for open fracture). One endoleak was noted, which resolved by the 1-month follow-up. The lone device-related complication was an endograft collapse at 5 months managed by repeat endografting, which was complicated by aortoesophageal fistula requiring esophagectomy and open reconstruction. No iliac injuries occurred. At 20-months of mean follow-up (range, 2 to 70 months), all patients are alive and well.",

    "abstract": "Isolated acute dissection of the abdominal aorta is an unusual event that may present with several different clinical scenarios. Because its incidence is low, the natural history is unknown. We report data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), the largest group of patients treated for acute aortic dissections. The aim of this study was to identify clinical characteristics, therapeutic approaches, risk factors for mortality, in-hospital outcome, and long-term results of this cohort, thus clarifying its natural history.\nA comprehensive analysis of 290 clinical variables on 18 patients affected by isolated acute abdominal aortic dissection (IAAAD) was performed. Among 1417 patients enrolled in the IRAD from 1996 to 2003, 532 (37.5%) had an acute type B dissection, of which 18 (1.3%) had an IAAAD. Theor mean age was 67.7 +/- 13.3 years, with a male predominance (n = 12, 67%). Aortic aneurysms pre-existed in 5 patients (28%). IAAAD was iatrogenic in 2 cases (11%).\nCompared with patients with type B aortic dissections, abdominal pain, mesenteric ischemia or infarction, limb ischemia, and hypotension as initial clinical signs were significantly more frequent in patients with IAAAD, whereas chest pain was more typical in patients with type B dissections. No neurologic symptoms, such as ischemic spinal cord damage or ischemic peripheral neuropathy, occurred in the IAAAD cohort. The 18 IAAAD patients were medically, surgically, or percutaneously managed in 12 (66.6%), five (27.8%), and one (5.6%) cases, respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 5.6% (n = 1). The patient who died was medically managed. No deaths were reported among patients who underwent surgery or had an endovascular procedure, irrespective of their preoperative status. A mean follow-up of 5 years (range, 1 month to 9 years) was completed for 71% (12 of 17) of the patients. Four patients (33.3%) died during the 9-year follow-up period. Overall survival was 93.3% +/- 12.6% at 1 year and 73.3% +/- 27.2% at 5 years. All patients who died during the follow-up period had in-hospital medical management (P = .04).\nIAAAD is a condition that may present differently compared with classic type B aortic dissections. IAAAD patients treated with surgical or endovascular procedures had a lower unadjusted in-hospital and long-term mortality rate compared with medically managed patients. On the basis of the present natural history report, continued surveillance appears mandatory. To improve the life expectancy of patients with IAAAD, aggressive surgical or endovascular management seems justified.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) has been increasingly used for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs), especially in major academic centers. The goal of this article is to report our results with an EVAR-first approach for rAAA which we adopted in 2001 in our community hospital.\nAll consecutive patients who underwent attempted repair for rAAA between February 2001 and July 2006 were analyzed. Only patients with computed tomographic or visual verification of extraluminal blood were included.\nA total of 40 patients (30 men; mean age, 76.4 +/- 7.2 years; range, 57-89 years) presented with rAAA. Thirty patients underwent attempted EVAR for rAAA, constituting 4.1% of all EVAR cases (n = 738), and 10 patients had attempted open repair. Twenty-one (53%) were transferred from another institution. Computed tomography was performed in 97.5%. On arrival to the emergency department, 43%% were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg). Transfemoral balloon occlusion was used in 12 cases (30%; 10 in the EVAR group and 2 in the open group). The length of operation was 128 +/- 35 minutes (range, 77-210 minutes) in EVAR cases. EVAR was completed in 93.3% (iliac anatomy and proximal endoleak caused open conversion in two cases). Out of the 10 open treated cases, 1 was converted to EVAR and survived. The grafts used for EVAR were AneuRx (n = 21), Zenith (n = 5), and Ancure (n = 4), and 97% were bifurcated. Five patients (16.6%) in the EVAR group died within 30 days (four required balloon occlusion). The mean length of stay was 9.1 +/- 6.2 days (range, 4-30 days) in survivors of EVAR. In the EVAR-treated group, two patients died (7 and 9 months; unrelated), and six of the surviving patients (23%) required secondary procedures (five femorofemoral bypasses for limb occlusions and one proximal cuff for a type I endoleak that caused repeat rupture) during a mean follow-up of 13.8 +/- 10.4 months (range, 3-39 months). The mortality rate was 40% (4/10) in patients who underwent open procedures during this period, with an overall mortality rate of 22.5% for all ruptures treated. The difference in 30-day mortality in the EVAR and open groups did not reach statistical significance (17% vs 40%; P = .19). In the entire cohort, hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg) on arrival and loss of consciousness were associated with 30-day mortality. Balloon occlusion was correlated with mortality in the EVAR-treated group (44% vs 4%; P = .019). The multivariate analysis using logistic regression showed that hypotension (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-42.0; P = .025), loss of consciousness (OR, 37.5; 95% CI, 3.4-40.8; P = .003), and the need for balloon occlusion (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.8-25.5; P = .042) were correlated with higher perioperative mortality, whereas age greater than 76 years, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and type of procedure did not.\nOur results show that EVAR is feasible with favorable outcomes in patients presenting with rAAA in a busy community hospital. There is a high secondary intervention rate, which can potentially be decreased by ensuring good iliac limb anatomy at the end of the procedure and by a closer follow-up.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that the aortic wall deforms uniformly and has uniform wall thickness about the circumference. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the aortic wall motion and thickness in the infrarenal aortic neck of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms who were undergoing endovascular repair (EVAR) and to compare the dynamic measurements of intravascular ultrasonography with the static measurements of computed tomographic angiography (CTA).\nA total of 25 patients were evaluated before surgery with CTA and three-dimensional reconstructions on a Vitrea workstation, followed by intraoperative assessment of the proximal aortic neck with intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) before EVAR. Infrarenal aortic neck dimensions on CTA were obtained at 1-mm intervals, but for the purposes of this study all dimensions on CTA were obtained 1 cm below the lowest renal artery. IVUS analysis of the proximal aortic neck was obtained with a 10-second recorded data loop of aortic wall motion. A Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer was used to view the recorded loop of aortic movement, and each image was captured and then evaluated with a SCION PCI Frame Grabber to determine aortic dimensions and wall thickness. IVUS diameters (250 measurements of each aorta) were recorded through a full continuous cardiac cycle from the epicenter of the lumen (maintaining the left renal vein in its normal anatomic configuration) in an anteroposterior (AP) direction in the area of greatest wall movement and 90 degrees perpendicular to this direction (lateral movement).\nThere was significant variation in infrarenal aortic wall movement about the circumference, with 1.7 +/- 0.6 mm (range, 0.6-2.7 mm) displacement in the AP direction and 0.9 +/- 0.5 mm (range, 0.3-1.5 mm) displacement in the lateral direction (P < .001). Aortic wall thickness was greater in the region of increased AP wall motion than in the area of lesser lateral wall motion (2.3 +/- 0.6 mm vs 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm; P < .001). There was no difference between the IVUS and CTA aortic neck measurements (25.5 vs 25.6 mm; not significant) during the midpoint of the cardiac cycle of IVUS. However, at peak systole, IVUS recorded a greater diameter than CTA (26.4 vs 25.6 mm; P < .001), and at end-diastole, IVUS recorded a smaller diameter than CTA (24.7 vs 25.6 mm; P = .01).\nThe infrarenal neck of aortic aneurysms deforms anisotropically during the cardiac cycle. The greatest displacement is in the AP direction and corresponds with a significantly greater wall thickness in this area. The magnitude of cyclic change in aortic diameter can be as high as 11%. Further evaluation of proximal aortic neck wall motion after EVAR is warranted to determine the interaction of various stent designs and the aortic wall.",

    "abstract": "Two randomized trials have shown similar mid-term outcomes for survival and quality of life after endovascular and conventional open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). With reduced hospital and intensive care stay, endovascular repair has been hypothesized to be more efficient than open repair. The Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM) trial was undertaken to assess the balance of costs and effects of endovascular vs open aneurysm repair.\nWe conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing endovascular repair with open repair in 351 patients with an AAA and studied costs, cost-effectiveness, and clinical outcome 1 year after surgery. In addition to clinical outcome, costs and quality of life were recorded up to 1 year in 170 patients in the endovascular repair group and in 170 in the open repair group. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for cost per life-year, event-free life-year, and quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Uncertainty regarding these outcomes was assessed using bootstrapping.\nPatients in the endovascular repair group experienced 0.72 QALY vs 0.73 in the open repair group (absolute difference, 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.038 to 0.058). Endovascular repair was associated with additional euro 4293 direct costs (euro 18,179 vs euro 13.886; 95% CI, euro 2,770 to euro 5,830). Most of the bootstrap estimates indicated that endovascular repair resulted in slightly longer overall and event-free survival associated with respective incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro76,100 and euro 171,500 per year gained. Open repair appeared the dominant strategy in costs per QALY.\nPresently, routine use of endovascular repair in patients also eligible for open repair does not result in a QALY gain at 1 year postoperatively, provides only a marginal overall survival benefit, and is associated with a substantial, if not prohibitive, increase in costs.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to determine the results of a specific technique in the performance of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and to compare results using this technique between standard-risk and high-risk patients eligible for Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) and between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.\nA total of 391 patients underwent 442 consecutive CEA procedures under general anesthesia with the intent to shunt, patch, and perform intraoperative completion duplex ultrasound imaging. Indications included 272 asymptomatic patients (61.5%) with carotid stenoses > or =60% and 170 symptomatic patients (38.5%) with carotid stenosis > or =50%. Data were analyzed to determine the early (< or =30 days) and long-term morbidity and mortality overall in standard-risk and high-risk procedures and in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The primary end points were the occurrence of all strokes or death or myocardial infarction (MI) in the first 30 postoperative days (100% follow-up) and the occurrence by life-table analysis of ipsilateral stroke or death or MI (SDMI) out to 93 months (mean, 31.4 months).\nA total of 441 (99.7%) procedures included shunting, 440 (99.5%) included patching, and 442 (100%) had completion duplex ultrasound imaging. Of these, 235 procedures were standard risk and 207 procedures were high risk. At the 30-day follow-up, there were two ipsilateral central neurologic deficits (1 major stroke, 1 minor stroke), no death, and one MI (0.45% for all strokes or death; 0.68% for all strokes or death or MI). After 30 days of follow-up, an additional 16 strokes (9 ipsilateral, 7 contralateral), eight MIs, and 38 deaths had occurred. No statistically significant difference was found between standard-risk and high-risk groups or between asymptomatic and symptomatic groups for stroke, death, MI, stroke or death, or stroke or death or MI at 30 days or during long-term follow-up at any interval up to 93 months.\nCEA performed with intent to treat using general anesthesia, shunting, patching, and completion duplex scanning results in extremely low 30-day and long-term morbidity and mortality in asymptomatic, symptomatic, standard-risk and high-risk patients. These results are substantially superior to those reported in carotid stenting trials for both carotid stenting and CEA and do not support the contention that there is a high-risk group for CEA.",

Using biomarkers in plaque and plasma, we evaluated oxidative stress and plaque vulnerability between early and late CEA in symptomatic patients.\nWe compared symptomatic stroke patients who underwent early CEA within 4 weeks of the last insult (group A; n = 15) with those who received CEA in the late stage beyond 4 weeks from the last symptom (group B; n = 57). They were divided into vulnerable (group Av, n = 13; group Bv, n = 33) and stable (group As, n = 2; group Bs, n = 24) subgroups according to the pathologic findings on their plaques. We studied the relationships among their primary symptoms, clinical findings, oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels, and gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-9) activity in their plaques and plasma.\nGroup A had a variety of symptoms; there was no difference in the outcome of CEA between groups A and B. The plaque and plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels were higher in group A than in group B (P < .05). The incidence of pathologically vulnerable plaque was higher in group A than in group B. Plaque oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels and MMP-9 activity were similar in group Av and group Bv and were higher in those groups than in group As and Bs.\nWe first demonstrated that vulnerable plaques in patients subjected to early CEA manifested a remarkable increase in oxidized low-density lipoprotein and MMP-9 activation. Our findings suggest that early CEA may be beneficial in the aspect of oxidative stress.",

Mean preoperative internal carotid artery (ICA) peak systolic velocity was 314 cm/s, 36% of treated hemispheres were symptomatic, and 42% of patients had neurologic symptoms for >6 months. Ten patients (10%) had contralateral ICA occlusion, six (6%) had recurrent carotid stenosis, and two (2%) had previous neck radiation. Local anesthesia was used in 72 (70%) cases and general in 31 (30%). Predilatation was used in 34 cases (33%), and closed-cell self-expanding stents were deployed and postdilated in all cases.\nTechnical success was achieved in 100 cases (97%). No major strokes or deaths occurred. One ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (1%), one contralateral transient ischemic attack (1%), and two minor strokes (2%) occurred. There were two wound complications (2%) and one major arterial complication (1%). Mean operative time was 69 minutes, and mean carotid flow reversal time was 21 minutes. Three awake patients (4%) did not tolerate carotid flow reversal. Hypotension/bradycardia occurred in 24 cases (23%). No electrocardiographic myocardial infarctions were diagnosed. At 40 months of follow-up, the stent patency rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 95%, and the stroke-free survival was 91%.\nTranscervical CAS with carotid flow reversal can be done with a high rate of technical success, a negligible rate of major adverse events, and an excellent 3-year stroke-free survival and stent patency rate. These results compare favorably with those of recently published prospective studies using distal filter protection during CAS.",

If virtual reality (VR) simulation is to be used as a valid means for credentialing physicians for CAS procedures, the assessment parameters must be able to evaluate the performance during CAS and to differentiate level of CAS experience. The aim of this study was to validate assessment parameters of a commercially available VR simulator (VIST, Vascular Interventional Surgical Trainer, Mentice, Gothenburg, Sweden) during a CAS procedure in experienced interventionalists.\nForty-five interventionalists (cardiologists, radiologists, vascular surgeons) who had performed at least 100 endovascular therapeutic cases, with varying experience in CAS were recruited: groups A, n = 12 (0 CAS procedures), B, n = 12 (1 to 20 CAS), C, n = 10 (21 to 50 CAS) and D, n = 11 (>50 CAS). All subjects performed a standard CAS procedure with a type I arch and were assessed by quantitative (procedure time, amount of contrast given, number of cineloops recorded, fluoroscopic time) and qualitative (clinical parameters and errors) metrics of the simulator. Participants also rated the realism and training potential of the simulator on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).\nThere were significant differences across the four groups A to D for procedure time (medians 20.5 vs 24 vs 19 vs 16 minutes, P = .002) and fluoroscopic time (12.5 vs 13 vs 10 vs 7 minutes, P < .001), respectively. Total numbers of errors recorded by the VR simulator did not achieve statistical significance (P = .209) across the four groups. All subjects rated the simulator highly (median 4) in terms of realism and training potential.\nTotal time and fluoroscopic time both recorded by a realistic VR simulator differentiate between levels of CAS experience in experienced interventionalists. Error scoring is currently not a valid mode of assessment and needs refinement.",

    "abstract": "Acute procedurally induced hemodynamic depression can occur after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study was performed to determine the frequency and risk factors for hypotension and bradycardia after the CAS procedure.\nThe study reviewed clinical variables and angiographic data of all patients undergoing elective CAS with neuroprotection during a recent 5-year period. Intravenous atropine was given selectively in cases of bradycardia (heart rate <60 beats/min or a decrease of >20 beats/min). We further defined hemodynamic depression as bradycardia or severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure fall >30 mm Hg). Frequency and potential risk factors for hemodynamic depression were analyzed by logistic regression.\nDuring the study period, 416 patients (99% male; mean age, 74 +/- 11 years) underwent the CAS procedure. The median degree of stenosis was 93% (range, 60% to 99%). The frequencies of post-CAS hemodynamic depression include hypotension in 58 (14%), bradycardia in 112 (27%), or both in 21 (5%). All patients with bradycardia received intraprocedural atropine, and all heart rates returned to the baseline level. Persistent hypotension occurred in 45 patients (11%). Increased age was associated with CAS-induced bradycardia or hypotension. Adjusted risk factors associated with hemodynamic depression include age >78 years (odds ratio [OR], 5.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.32 to 15.25; P = .01) and ejection fraction of <25% (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 0.58 to 6.58; P = .02). CEA-related restenosis was associated with a reduced risk of hemodynamic depression (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.69, P = .001). Persistent hypotension after CAS was associated with an increased risk of an adverse clinical event (44%, P = .001).\nHemodynamic depression, including hypotension and bradycardia, is frequent after CAS. However, CAS-induced hemodynamic depression is rare in patients with postendarterectomy stenosis. Patients with compromised ejection fraction and increased age are at a higher risk of presenting with CAS-induced hemodynamic instability, and persistent hypotension after CAS is associated with an increased postprocedural complication rate.",

The frequencies of post-CAS hemodynamic depression include hypotension in 58 (14%), bradycardia in 112 (27%), or both in 21 (5%). All patients with bradycardia received intraprocedural atropine, and all heart rates returned to the baseline level. Persistent hypotension occurred in 45 patients (11%). Increased age was associated with CAS-induced bradycardia or hypotension. Adjusted risk factors associated with hemodynamic depression include age >78 years (odds ratio [OR], 5.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.32 to 15.25; P = .01) and ejection fraction of <25% (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 0.58 to 6.58; P = .02). CEA-related restenosis was associated with a reduced risk of hemodynamic depression (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.69, P = .001). Persistent hypotension after CAS was associated with an increased risk of an adverse clinical event (44%, P = .001).",

    "abstract": "Recent studies reveal a consistently higher periprocedural risk of stroke during carotid artery stenting in octogenarians compared with younger patients. The mechanisms accounting for this increased risk of embolization and stroke in elderly patients are poorly understood. We analyzed the calcium content and aortic arch type in a consecutive series of patients to determine whether aortic arch calcium content is related to either age or arch type classification.\nAortic arch calcium content and arch classification were examined in consecutive patients undergoing thoracic computed tomography scans. The calcium content of the aortic arch, measured from the aortic root to the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the carina, was determined by using a coronary calcium score grade. The aortic arch classification was determined by using two-dimensional and multiplanar image reconstructions. Linear regression and analysis of variance were used to determine the effect of age, arch classification, and patient comorbidity on aortic arch calcium content.\nThe computed tomography scans of 94 patients were analyzed. There was a positive correlation between age and aortic arch calcium content; the mean calcium score (Agatston units) for patients increased by decade (age <50 years, 12.6 +/- 12.3, n = 18; age 50-59 years, 14.6 +/- 8.2, n = 21; age 60-69 years, 276 +/- 120, n = 17; age 70-79 years, 1382 +/- 366, n = 27; age > or =80 years, 3889 +/- 778, n = 11; P < .001). There was significantly more arch calcium in patients 75 years or older compared with patients younger than 75 years (2458 +/- 447 vs 145 +/- 49; P < .001). There was no effect of patient comorbidity on aortic arch calcium content. Patients with type II aortic arches were older and had a higher calcium content compared with patients with type I aortic arches (2028 +/- 546 vs 712 +/- 191; P = .01). Power analysis showed more than 99% power to detect differences between patients younger than 75 years and 75 years or older.\nPatients 75 years of age or older have significantly more aortic arch calcification compared with younger patients. Increased arch calcium content and type II aortic arches may be markers of increased potential for embolization during endovascular manipulation that transverses the aortic arch. Preprocedural determination of aortic arch calcification and morphology may help to further stratify periprocedural carotid artery stenting risk in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Factors predicting in-stent restenosis (ISR) and future need for target lesion revascularization (TLR) after carotid artery stenting (CAS) remain undetermined. We hypothesized that the patterns of restenotic lesions may provide prognostic information. In this study, we developed an ultrasound classification scheme for ISR based on lesion length and distribution and assessed factors that may predict the need for TLR.\nPatients were followed up after CAS with B-mode ultrasound imaging, and ISR lesions (> or =40% stenosis) were classified into type I (focal < or =10 mm end-stent lesions), II (focal < or =10 mm, intrastent), III (diffuse >10 mm, intrastent), IV (diffuse >10 mm proliferative, extending outside the stent), and V (total occlusion). The frequency of lesion types was assessed. Accuracy of the ultrasound classification was confirmed with angiography. We recorded patient (age, gender, comorbidities), lesion (severity, etiology, symptomatic status) and procedural features (type, number, length of stents), and the need for TLR.\nEighty-five ISR lesions developed after 255 CAS procedures. Their percentage distribution was type I, 40; type II, 25.9; type III, 12.9; for type IV, 20; and type V, 1.2. Accuracy of the ultrasound classification was confirmed by angiography (r(2) = 0.82). Inter-rater agreement for the assignment of lesion type based on ultrasound was 0.88 (very good). TLR was performed in 13 that were > or =80% diameter reducing. On univariate analysis, the need for TLR was highest in type IV lesions (0%, 0%, 27.3%, and 58.8% [types I to IV, respectively]; P = .001). History of ISR (2.9%, 0%, 0%, and 41.2% [types I to IV]; P = .003) and diabetes mellitus (20.6%, 22.7%, 45.5%, and 52.9% [types I to IV]; P = .02) occurred more frequently with type IV ISR lesions. On multivariate analysis of all patient, lesion, and procedural characteristics, only the type of ISR (odds ratio, 5.1) and a history of diabetes (odds ratio, 9.7) were independent predictors of TLR.\nThe proposed classification accurately grades the magnitude of intimal hyperplasia after CAS and provides important prognostic information. Diffuse proliferative (type IV) ISR lesions and diabetes are important determinants of long-term outcome after CAS. This classification will facilitate a standardized description of recurrence after CAS and enable early identification of high-risk patients for additional monitoring, treatment, and investigation.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to document the results of our current practice of open mesenteric revascularization to enable comparison with the recent trend of percutaneous endovascular therapy for the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia.\nPatients were identified via operation code data as well ongoing audit data from 1992 until 2006. Only patients with a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia secondary to atherosclerosis for 3 months or longer were included in the study. Follow-up data have been collected prospectively and include clinical examination and history, as well as graft surveillance consisting of mesenteric duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography, and/or angiography every 6 months for 3 years and then yearly thereafter.\nThirty-nine consecutive patients underwent 41 open revascularization procedures for chronic mesenteric ischemia, comprising 67 bypass grafts. The mean patient age was 65 years (range, 45-85 years), and 44% (n = 17) were male. Symptoms were present on average for 11 months (range, 4-48 months) before treatment. The average weight loss was 11.4 kg, and three patients (7.6%) also had evidence of ischemic enteritis. There was one perioperative death, thus giving a perioperative mortality rate of 2.5%. Perioperative morbidity occurred in five patients (12.2%). Primary graft patency was 92% at 5 years. Seven patients died during follow-up, which ranged from 4 to 161 months (mean, 39 months)-one (2.5%) from mesenteric ischemia. Two (5%) other patients have had recurrent mesenteric ischemic symptoms.\nOpen surgical mesenteric revascularization by bypass grafting for atherosclerotic-induced chronic mesenteric ischemia can be performed with low mortality and morbidity and provides excellent long-term primary patency rates and symptom-free outcomes. Pending more data on the acute and long-term results of endovascular techniques, open mesenteric revascularization remains the gold standard for most patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Subintimal angioplasty (SIA) is an increasingly used method of lower extremity revascularization for patients with chronic arterial occlusions. To assess the technical feasibility, safety, and 3-year outcomes of patients treated with SIA, we performed a retrospective review of our early experience.\nPatient information-including demographics, indications, procedures, noninvasive arterial studies, and postprocedural events-was recorded in a database. Outcomes were determined on an intention-to-treat basis, as well as by technical success, by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Continuous data were compared by using the Student t test, and survival curves were compared by log-rank testing.\nFrom December 2002 through December 2003, 104 patients (105 limbs) underwent SIA of 159 occlusive lesions involving the iliac (n = 10), superficial femoral (n = 85), popliteal (n = 48), or tibial (n = 16) arteries. Sixty-six (62.9%) patients were treated for critical limb ischemia, and 39 patients (37.1%) were treated for disabling claudication. Technical success was achieved in 91 procedures (86.7%) and resulted in a mean increase in ankle-brachial index of 0.36 +/- 0.16. The mean follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 0-46 months). During this period, 18 patients (17.0%) died, and 15 amputations (14.3%) were performed, 6 of which were performed for patients on whom SIA had been unsuccessful. In patients undergoing successful SIA, the primary patency was 55%, 43%, and 35% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Twenty-one patients underwent a total of 23 percutaneous procedures to maintain or restore patency of the SIA during the study period. This resulted in secondary patency rates of 71%, 63%, and 51% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed critical limb ischemia to be the only predictor of reduced primary patency. Fifteen patients with inoperable critical limb ischemia underwent successful SIA. Limb salvage in this group was 54% and 43% at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Limb salvage in operative candidates was 100% and 88% at the same intervals. In patients with disabling claudication, 94% experienced improvement in symptoms 3 months after the procedure, and 68% of patients reported sustained improvement at 36 months. In all operative candidates successfully treated with SIA, freedom from surgical bypass was 83% and 73% at 12 and 36 months, respectively.\nSIA for the treatment of lower extremity chronic arterial occlusions is technically feasible, results in minimal morbidity, and provides satisfactory revascularization without surgical bypass. Secondary patency is comparable to that of autologous vein bypass and is achieved with a low rate of reintervention. When used as first-line therapy, SIA provides most patients with limb salvage and freedom from surgical bypass at 3 years.",

    "abstract": "The preferential use of primary iliac stenting vs selective stenting is controversial. This study compares the early and late clinical outcomes of primary vs selective iliac stenting at our institution.\nA total of 110 consecutive patients with iliac stenosis (149 lesions) underwent primary stenting over a recent 5-year period (primary stent group). The early technical and clinical success and late clinical outcomes were compared with 41 patients (41 iliac lesions) who had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) followed by selective stenting for suboptimal PTA (selective stent group). All patients were evaluated clinically and by duplex scanning with ankle-brachial indexes at 1, 6, and 12 months and every 12 months thereafter.\nThe perioperative complication rate for the primary stent group was 2.7% (three minor hematomas) vs 24% for the selective stent group (P < .0001). The overall early clinical success rate was 97% for the primary stent group vs 83% for the selective stent group (P = .002), however, the rate was 100% for short stenosis (A and B lesions <5 cm TASC classification) in both groups; in contrast to 93% for the primary stent group vs 46% for the selective stent group for longer stenoses (TASC - C and D lesions, P = .0003). The overall late clinical success was comparable for both groups: 88% for the primary stent group vs 80% for the selective stent group, however, this rate was superior for the longer lesions in the primary stent group, 84% vs 46% (P = .007). The primary patency rates at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years were 98%, 94%, 87%, and 77% for the primary stent group vs 83%, 78%, 69%, and 69% for the selective stent group (P = .030).

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment for mycotic aortic aneurysms is not optimal. Even with a large excision, extensive debridement, in situ or extra-anatomical reconstruction, and with or without lifelong antibiotic treatment, mycotic aneurysms still carry very high mortality and morbidity. The use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic aortic aneurysms simplifies the procedure and provides a good alternative for this critical condition. However, the question remains: if EVAR is placed in an infected bed, what is the outcome of the infection? Does it heal, become aggravated, or even cause a disastrous aortic rupture? In this study, we tried to clarify the risk factors for such an adverse response.\nA literature review was undertaken by using MEDLINE. All relevant reports on endoluminal management of mycotic aortic aneurysms were included. Logistic regressions were applied to identify predictors of persistent infection.\nA total of 48 cases from 22 reports were included. The life-table analysis showed that the 30-day survival rate was 89.6% +/- 4.4%, and the 2-year survival rate was 82.2% +/- 5.8%. By univariate analysis, age 65 years or older, rupture of the aneurysm (including those with aortoenteric fistula and aortobronchial fistula), and fever at the time of operation were identified as significant predictors of persistent infection, and preoperative use of antibiotics for longer than 1 week and an adjunct procedure combined with EVAR were identified as significant protective factors for persistent infection. However, by multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only significant independent predictors identified were rupture of aneurysm and fever.\nEVAR seems a possible alternative method for treating mycotic aortic aneurysms. Identification of the risk factors for persistent infection may help to decrease surgical morbidity and mortality. EVAR could be used as a temporary measure; however, a definite surgical treatment should be considered for patients present with aneurysm rupture or fever.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic injury of the thoracic aorta is a life-threatening complication in patients who sustain deceleration or crush injuries. The magnitude of force necessary to cause blunt thoracic aortic injury results in a high proportion of concomitant injuries, posing a significant challenge for prioritizing management. Open surgical mortality is increased in the presence of coexisting head, lung, and abdominal injuries. Spinal cord ischemia may occur following aortic cross-clamping and operative hypotension. Endovascular stent-graft placement offers a safe, effective, and timely treatment option. The aim of this study was to assess our single center experience of endovascular repair following acute blunt traumatic aortic injury.\nData from thirteen consecutive patients (mean age, 43.2 years; range, 16 to 84 years) with acute blunt traumatic aortic injury treated by endovascular stent-graft insertion between October 2001 and March 2007 was prospectively collected. Demographics, injury characteristics, technique, and complications were recorded. Follow-up data consisted of computed tomographic angiography and plain chest radiography at regular intervals. Mean and median follow-up after stent-graft implantation were 28.9 and 29 months, respectively.\nAll patients underwent endovascular repair within a median of 9 hours from hospital presentation. Two patients underwent carotico-carotid bypass immediately prior to endovascular stenting during a single anesthetic. Stent-graft implantation was technically successful in all patients. No patient required conversion to open surgical repair of the acute blunt traumatic aortic injury. Procedure-related paraplegia was zero. Complications included proximal migration of initial stent-graft in one patient and iliac artery avulsion in another patient with consequent ilio-femoral bypass. The median hospital stay was 17 days. There were no in-hospital deaths.\nEndovascular repair is evolving as the procedure of choice for acute blunt traumatic aortic injury. Treatment of lesions that extend into the aortic arch is feasible with extra-anatomical bypass. In our study, endovascular repair of blunt traumatic aortic injury is a safe procedure with low morbidity and a mortality rate of zero.",

    "abstract": "Endotension has been defined as persistently increased pressure within the excluded sac of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resulting in increasing aneurysm size after endovascular repair in the absence of endoleak. Devices that use expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) have been associated with the development of endotension and continued AAA enlargement. In this study, intra-aneurysmal pressure and aneurysm content were evaluated after endovascular repair with the Enovus ePTFE stent graft in a canine model.\nProsthetic ePTFE aneurysms, each containing a solid-state, strain-gauge pressure transducer, were implanted in the infrarenal aorta of 13 mongrel dogs (25-35 kg). A second pressure transducer was inserted into the native aorta for systemic arterial pressure measurement. The stent graft was then deployed to exclude the aneurysm via distal aortic access. Comparison was made among three distinct stent grafts: the Trivascular Enovus (nonporous ePTFE; four animals), the original Gore Excluder (porous ePTFE; five animals), and the Medtronic AneuRx (Dacron; four animals). Daily systemic and intra-AAA pressures were measured for 4 weeks. Intra-aneurysmal pressures were indexed to simultaneously measured systemic pressures. After 4 weeks, the aorta, the prosthetic aneurysm, and its contents were harvested, photographed, and processed for histologic investigation with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining.\nWithin 24 hours after exclusion, the mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure within the AAA sac tapered to less than 20% of systemic pressure for all three stent graft types. Throughout the postoperative period, significantly lower indexed intra-aneurysmal pressures were present in the Enovus- and AneuRx-treated aneurysms as compared with those treated with the original Excluder stent graft (0.05 +/- 0.04, 0.16 +/- 0.06, and 0.06 +/- 0.03 for the Enovus, Excluder, and AneuRx, respectively). Histologic analysis of the Enovus-treated aneurysms demonstrated intraluminal content characterized almost entirely by erythrocytes and infrequent white blood cells without the fibrin organization-characteristics of acute or chronic thrombus. This contrasted with the content of the Excluder-treated aneurysms, which contained poorly organized fibrin deposition suggestive of acute thrombus, and of the AneuRx-treated aneurysms, which demonstrated mature, well-organized collagenous connective tissue.\nExclusion of the AAA with the Enovus stent graft resulted in nearly complete elimination of intra-aneurysmal pressure in this model. Histologic analysis of the aneurysm content further suggested complete exclusion, including elimination of circulating clotting factors and fibroblasts responsible for thrombus formation and reorganization. Ultimately, clinical evaluation will be necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of this stent graft in preventing the development of endotension.",

The dogs were divided into two groups. A test group (n = 6) received experimental antibiotic-bonded gelatin-sealed knitted polyester grafts, loaded with two antibiotics, rifampin and tobramycin. A control group (n = 6) received commercial gelatin-sealed knitted polyester grafts. At the end of graft implantation, 50 mul of a 1.8 x 10(4) CFU/mL S aureus solution were instilled directly over the graft. One week after implantation, grafts were harvested with sterile technique. Quantitative cultures were obtained from all the harvested grafts. The results were expressed as colony-forming units per cm(2) of surface of the graft. Bacteriological study was also performed on various tissue samples. The chi(2) test was used to compare the culture proven infection of control and antibiotics-bonded grafts.\nMean inoculum size was similar in the two groups of dogs. Five of the six control grafts grew S aureus A980142 at the time of graft removal, whereas none of the six antibiotic-bonded gelatin-sealed grafts were infected (P = .0192).

    "abstract": "The syndecan family of cell surface proteoglycans can bind and modulate the activity of a diverse group of soluble and insoluble ligands, which have been shown to modulate events relevant to acute tissue repair and chronic injury responses. The expression of members of the syndecan family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans during the course of aortic aneurysm formation has not been previously investigated. In this investigation, the spatiotemporal expression of syndecan-1, -2, and -4 was characterized in a murine model of aneurysm formation.\nApoE-deficient mice were maintained on an atherogenic diet for 8 weeks with concurrent infusion of angiotensin II (0.75 mg/kg/day SQ). The expression of syndecan-1, -2, and -4 at the site of aneurysm formation was characterized by immunohistochemical staining and colocalization determined by double fluorescent immunostaining. Correlative examination was performed on tissue specimens harvested from patients at the time of open aneurysm repair.\nIn the aortic wall of age-matched, untreated mice, syndecan-4 was localized to the smooth muscle cells of the media. However, neither syndecan-1 nor syndecan-2 could be detected. Within 1 week of initiating a high fat diet and infusion of angiotensin II, syndecan-1 was abundantly expressed in infiltrating macrophages, predominantly localized to the periadventitial aorta. The expression of macrophage-associated syndecan-1 was accentuated during the course of aneurysm formation. As the aneurysm matured, syndecan-2 was abundantly expressed within the aortic thrombus and heterogeneous syndecan-4 staining noted within the aortic media. Significantly, abundant syndecan-1 positive macrophages were observed in explanted human specimens.\nGiven the established functional properties of this family heparan sulfate proteoglycans, chronically accelerated macrophage syndecan-1 shedding could generate a sustained proinflammatory, proteolytic, growth-stimulating environment. As a component of a counterbalancing reparative process, cell surface syndecan-2 may assist in TGF-beta mediated responses to limit the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

The expression of macrophage-associated syndecan-1 was accentuated during the course of aneurysm formation. As the aneurysm matured, syndecan-2 was abundantly expressed within the aortic thrombus and heterogeneous syndecan-4 staining noted within the aortic media.

    "abstract": "Secondary chronic venous disorders (CVD) usually follow an episode of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Most occluded venous segments recanalize over the first 6 to 12 months after an episode of acute DVT, leading to chronic luminal changes and a combination of partial obstruction and reflux. Such morphological changes produce venous hypertension with the highest levels of ambulatory venous pressure occurring in patients with combined outflow obstruction and distal reflux. The clinical manifestations of secondary CVD, including pain, venous claudication, edema, skin changes, and ulceration are commonly referred to as the post-thrombotic syndrome. Such sequelae are best avoided by early and aggressive treatment of proximal DVT. The diagnostic evaluation of secondary CVD is similar to primary CVD and is based upon duplex ultrasound. However, the definition of hemodynamically significant venous stenosis remains obscure and there are no reliable tests to confirm the presence of such lesions. Diagnosis depends more on anatomic rather than hemodynamic criteria, and IVUS is superior to venography in estimating the morphological degree and extent of iliac vein stenosis. The fundamental role of compression in the treatment of CVD is well recognized. Compliance with compression is essential to heal ulcers and minimize recurrence. The efficacy of various adjuncts to ulcer treatment, including complex wound dressings and medications have been variable. Although superficial venous surgery has not been demonstrated to improve ulcer healing rates, it does decrease ulcer recurrence. Deep venous valve reconstruction is performed in only a few specialized centers, and the results are better for primary than for secondary CVD. Treatment of incompetent perforating veins remains controversial. Although artificial venous valves are promising, most early experimental models have failed. With respect to venous obstruction, iliocaval angioplasty and stenting has emerged as the primary treatment for proximal iliofemoral venous obstruction with surgical bypass assuming a secondary role.",

    "abstract": "Primary chronic venous disorders, which according to the CEAP classification are those not associated with an identifiable mechanism of venous dysfunction, are among the most common in Western populations. Varicose veins without skin changes are present in about 20% of the population while active ulcers may be present in as many as 0.5%. Primary venous disorders are thought to arise from intrinsic structural and biochemical abnormalities of the vein wall. Advanced cases may be associated with skin changes and ulceration arising from extravasation of macromolecules and red blood cells leading to endothelial cell activation, leukocyte diapedesis, and altered tissue remodeling with intense collagen deposition. Laboratory evaluation of patients with primary venous disorders includes venous duplex ultrasonography performed in the upright position, occasionally supplemented with plethysmography and, when deep venous reconstruction is contemplated, ascending and descending venography. Primary venous disease is most often associated with truncal saphenous insufficiency. Although historically treated with stripping of the saphenous vein and interruption and removal of major tributary and perforating veins, a variety of endovenous techniques are now available to ablate the saphenous veins and have generally been demonstrated to be safe and less morbid than traditional procedures. Sclerotherapy also has an important role in the management of telangiectasias; primary, residual, or recurrent varicosities without connection to incompetent venous trunks; and congenital venous malformations. The introduction of ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy has broadened potential indications to include treatment of the main saphenous trunks, varicose tributaries, and perforating veins. Surgical repair of incompetent deep venous valves has been reported to be an effective procedure in nonrandomized series, but appropriate case selection is critical to successful outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The venous system is, in many respects, more complex than the arterial system and a thorough understanding of venous anatomy, pathophysiology, and available diagnostic tests is required in the management of acute and chronic venous disorders. The venous system develops through several stages, which may be associated with a number of development anomalies. A thorough knowledge of lower extremity venous anatomy, anatomic variants, and the recently updated nomenclature is required of all venous practitioners. Effective venous return from the lower extremities requires the interaction of the heart, a pressure gradient, the peripheral muscle pumps of the leg, and competent venous valves. In the absence of pathology, this system functions to reduce venous pressure from approximately 100 mm Hg to a mean of 22 mm Hg within a few steps. The severe manifestations of chronic venous insufficiency result from ambulatory venous hypertension, or a failure to reduce venous pressure with exercise. Although the precise mechanism remains unclear, venous hypertension is thought to induce the associated skin changes through a number of inflammatory mechanisms. Several diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of acute and chronic venous disease. Although venous duplex ultrasonography has become the standard for detection of acute deep venous thrombosis, adjuvant modalities such as contrast, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance venography have an increasing role. Duplex ultrasonography is also the most useful test for detecting and localizing chronic venous obstruction and valvular incompetence. However, it provides relatively little quantitative hemodynamic information and is often combined with measurements of hemodynamic severity determined by a number of plethysmographic methods. Finally, critical assessment of venous treatment modalities requires an understanding of the objective clinical outcome and quality of life instruments available.",

    "abstract": "Acute venous disorders include deep venous thrombosis, superficial venous thrombophlebitis, and venous trauma. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) most often arises from the convergence of multiple genetic and acquired risk factors, with a variable estimated incidence of 56 to 160 cases per 100,000 population per year. Acute thrombosis is followed by an inflammatory response in the thrombus and vein wall leading to thrombus amplification, organization, and recanalization. Clinically, there is an exponential decrease in thrombus load over the first 6 months, with most recanalization occurring over the first 6 weeks after thrombosis. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) are the most important acute and chronic complications of DVT. Despite the effectiveness of thromboembolism prophylaxis, appropriate measures are utilized in as few as one-third of at-risk patients. Once established, the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been defined by randomized clinical trials, with appropriate anticoagulation constituting the mainstay of management. Despite its effectiveness in preventing recurrent VTE, anticoagulation alone imperfectly protects against PTS. Although randomized trials are currently lacking, at least some data suggests that catheter-directed thrombolysis or combined pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy can reduce post-thrombotic symptoms and improve quality of life after acute ileofemoral DVT. Inferior vena caval filters continue to have a role among patients with contra-indications to, complications of, or failure of anticoagulation. However, an expanded role for retrievable filters for relative indications has yet to be clearly established. The incidence of superficial venous thrombophlebitis is likely under-reported, but it occurs in approximately 125,000 patients per year in the United States. Although the appropriate treatment remains controversial, recent investigations suggest that anticoagulation may be more effective than ligation in preventing DVT and PE. Venous injuries are similarly under-reported and the true incidence is unknown. Current recommendations include repair of injuries to the major proximal veins. If repair not safe or possible, ligation should be performed.",

    "abstract": "While medical high risk (MHR) has been proposed as an indication for carotid artery stenting (CAS), the impact of MHR on long-term survival and stroke after CAS has not been described.\nA retrospective chart review of CAS procedures at our institution was performed. One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients who underwent 196 CAS procedures were classified by MHR status based on cardiac, pulmonary, and renal criteria routinely used in high-risk clinical trials. Survival and stroke rates were compared after 90 CAS procedures in MHR patients vs 106 CAS procedures in normal risk patients. Survival results were also compared with 365 contemporaneous carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures in 346 patients.\nThe mean age of CAS patients was 72 years, with 87% having a smoking history, 85% hypertension, 38% diabetes, 39% symptomatic, and 74% documented coronary artery disease. Mean follow-up was 23 months. Recurrent stenosis after CEA comprised 21% of all CAS procedures. During the 30-day post-procedure period, there were five minor strokes, one major stroke, and one death, for a combined stroke/death rate of 3.6%. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated mortality of 5% at 1 year and 21% at 3 years for the entire cohort. Cox regression analysis found that MHR designation was not associated with increased mortality or an increase in a composite end point of death or stroke. MHR patients had mortality of 4% at 1 year and 22% at 3 years. Normal risk patients had mortality of 6% at 1 year and 20% at 3 years. Preoperative age over 80 years old, low density lipoprotein (LDL) > or =160 mg/dL, and serum creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dL conferred statistically significant risk for death (Hazard ratios: 2.9, 4.3, and 2.4, respectively). As a point of comparison, a contemporaneous group of CEA patients were analyzed similarly. After adjusting for age over 80 years old and serum creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dL, there was no survival difference between MHR patients undergoing CAS or CEA.\nThe presence of MHR did not impact long-term survival or stroke rate after CAS, and overall survival of MHR patients in our series was comparable with risk-adjusted controls undergoing CEA. These results suggest the need for more refined predictors of medical risk to optimally guide patients in selecting carotid revascularization strategies.",

    "abstract": "The 2006 update of the DOQI guidelines has stated that in patients with end-stage renal disease, autogenous radial-cephalic, or brachial-cephalic fistulas are the preferred access modalities, followed by transposed brachial-basilic (TBB) fistulas and prosthetic arteriovenous (AV) grafts. AV grafts are in general least preferred; however, there is very limited data comparing directly the last two modalities. The aim of the present study is to compare outcomes of the TBB fistula and the Vectra Vascular Access Graft.\nSeventy-six patients had a prosthetic brachial-axillary Vectra graft placed, while in 41 patients brachial-basilic upper arm transposition was performed. Graft surveillance to detect a failing/failed access was followed by endovascular treatment, rheolytic thrombectomy (AngioJet, Possis Medical), and/or angioplasty +/- stenting of the responsible anatomical lesion(s).\nUse of Vectra grafts and TBB fistulas started after a median (interquartile range) of 14 (7-30) and 70 (52-102) days, respectively (P < .001), as early as the operative day in some patients with grafts. Postoperative complications were more frequent in TBB fistulas and late complications (mainly access thrombosis) in Vectra grafts. Total number of thrombectomy sessions performed for graft or fistula occlusion was 45 and 7, respectively (P = .032); total number of isolated angioplasty sessions, performed for failing graft or fistula was 31 and 45, respectively (P = .004). Although primary patency of the two access modalities was equivalent, primary assisted patency was significantly reduced in Vectra grafts (70% at 12 months and 58% at 18 months), compared with TBB fistulas (82% at 12 months and 78% at 18 months, P = .033); however, as a result of endovascular intervention, secondary patency rates at 12 months (87% vs 88%) and 18 months (87% vs 83%) were equivalent (P = .91). Presence of arterial anastomosis stenosis treated with angioplasty at any stage had a significant negative predictive value on secondary patency rates at 12 and 18 months which were 61%, compared with 96% for Vectra grafts that had any intra-graft, venous outflow, draining or central vein stenosis treated with angioplasty at any stage (P = .010).\nAggressive graft surveillance and endovascular treatment methods can yield equivalent long-term secondary patency rates between Vectra graft and TBB fistulas. The advantage of earlier use of Vectra graft must be balanced against the need for more frequent secondary interventions and the risk of graft infection.",

    "abstract": "The role of carotid surgery for the management of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is challenged by carotid artery stenting (CAS). We reviewed redo CEA in a consecutive series of patients to determine the safety, durability, and long-term benefit associated with repeat surgical treatment for restenosis.\nA consecutive series of 73 redo procedures in 72 patients (57% men) with a mean age 66 years (range, 49-81 years) was analyzed. The mean interval between prior CEA and redo CEA was 53 months (range, 8-192 months). Operative indications included symptomatic restenosis in 28 patients (38%). A patch angioplasty was performed in 62 patients (85%). The main outcome measures included perioperative and late stroke and death, and the development of secondary restenosis.\nThere were no perioperative deaths or strokes. During a mean follow-up of 52 months (range, 12-144 months), the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival was 85% at 5 years. At 5 years, the cumulative rate of freedom from all strokes was 98%, and the freedom from ipsilateral stroke was 100%. After secondary procedures, re-recurrent stenosis > or =50% occurred in 10 patients (13.7%). The cumulative freedom from re-restenosis (> or =50%) was 85% at 5 years. Five patients (7%) received tertiary carotid reconstructions.\nRepeat CEA for recurrent stenosis can be performed safely with excellent long-term protection from stroke.

    "abstract": "Vascular access is a necessity for patients with end-stage renal disease who need chronic intermittent hemodialysis. According to Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, radial-cephalic (RC) and brachial-cephalic (BC) arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are the first and second choice for vascular access, respectively. If these options are not possible, an autogenous brachial-basilic fistula in the upper arm (BBAVF) or a prosthetic brachial-antecubital forearm loop (PTFE loop) may be considered. Until now, it was not clear which access type was preferable. We have performed a randomized study comparing BBAVF and prosthetic implantation in patients without the possibility for RCAVF or BCAVF.\nPatients with failed primary/secondary access or inadequate arterial and/or venous vessels were randomized for either BBAVF or PTFE loop creation. The numbers of complications and interventions were recorded. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate primary, assisted-primary and secondary patency rates. The patency rates were compared with the log-rank test. Complication and intervention rates were compared with the Mann-Whitney test.\nA total of 105 patients were randomized for a BBAVF or PTFE loop (52 vs 53, respectively). Primary and assisted-primary 1-year patency rates were significantly higher in the BBAVF group: 46% +/- 7.4% vs 22% +/- 6.1% (P = .005) and 87% +/- 5.0% vs 71% +/- 6.7% (P = .045) for the BBAVF and PTFE group, respectively. Secondary patencies were comparable for both groups; 89% +/- 4.6% vs 85% +/- 5.2% for the BBAVF and PTFE group, respectively. The incidence rate of complications was 1.6 per patient-year in the BBAVF group vs 2.7 per patient-year in the PTFE group. Patients in the BBAVF group needed a total of 1.7 interventions per patient-year vs 2.7 per patient-year for the PTFE group.\nThese data show a significantly better primary and assisted-primary patency in the BBAVF group compared with the PTFE group. Furthermore, in the BBAVF group, fewer interventions were needed. Therefore, we conclude that BBAVF is the preferred choice for vascular access if RCAVF or BCAVF creation is impossible, or when these types of access have already failed.",

    "abstract": "Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is indicated to treat the symptoms of intermittent claudication and increase walking distance in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). At the time of approval, the United States Food and Drug Administration required an additional long-term safety study to evaluate the effect cilostazol on mortality.\nA total of 1899 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PAD and symptoms of claudication were screened for participation in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled safety study of cilostazol. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which was the primary analysis (n = 1435), was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication and included patients who were followed up >30 days after discontinuation of study drug. A total of 717 patients received cilostazol and 718 received placebo. Cilostazol was administered at a primary dose of 100 mg twice daily. The dose could be reduced to 50 mg twice daily if patients experienced an adverse event that might have been drug related.\nLong-term adherence to study medication was poor, with >60% of participants discontinuing therapy by 36 months. The mortality analysis therefore focused on deaths during the period on-treatment, defined as the period during which the study drug was taken plus a 30-day follow-up period after dosing. Total patient-years of exposure were 1046 on-treatment for cilostazol and 1090 for placebo. On-treatment, there were 18 deaths on cilostazol and 19 deaths on placebo for a hazard ratio of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-1.88). Cardiovascular deaths on-treatment occurred in 14 patients on cilostazol and 14 on placebo. In the full ITT population at 36 months, there were 101 deaths, 49 on cilostazol and 52 on placebo, with hazard ratio of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.64-1.39). Thus, most deaths occurred >30 days after study drug discontinuation. Serious bleeding events affected 18 patients taking cilostazol in the on-treatment population and 22 taking placebo. The rates of bleeding events were similar in patients who used aspirin, aspirin plus clopidogrel, or anticoagulants at anytime during the course of the study\nThis long-term study demonstrated no safety signal for cilostazol on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. The study, however, was underpowered to detect a small adverse impact of cilostazol on mortality (hazard ratio upper bound of the 95% CI was 1.88 in the on-treatment population). Serious bleeding events appeared not to be increased by cilostazol.",

Placement with real-time IVUS imaging requires two venous access sites, one for the filter delivery system and one for the IVUS catheter, which makes the procedure more invasive. Alternatively, a single-access technique of IVUS imaging of the vena cava requires measuring the distance from the access site to the desired location for filter placement and then delivering the filter to that distance blindly, risking filter misplacement. We describe in this article a single puncture technique that allows for real-time imaging to position the filter delivery sheath using IVUS and reduces the uncertainty of the blind positioning of the filter delivery system.",

Our patient complained of episodic neck pain on the left site under the mastoid process for the last year. The child was otherwise healthy. Autologous reconstruction without graft interposition was planned. Surgical repair was performed by resection of the main body of the aneurysm and restoration of the arterial continuity with end-to-end anastomosis. Because nondilated proximal and distal vessels could not be approximated, the most distal end of the aneurysm was tapered over a mandril. To prevent redilation, a tubular polyester external stent was fitted around the diseased segment.",

This enhanced ostial visualization enables a precise positioning and deployment of a balloon-expandable stent in aortic arch vessels. This dual guidewire technique facilitates the visual identification of arch vessel origin and reduces potential contrast requirement, which provides procedural benefit in patients with renal insufficiency or contrast allergy.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine proteases are potent elastolytic enzymes and together with their inhibitor, cystatin C, have been linked with the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). These enzymes and their inhibitors have previously been studied in AAAs, but comparisons have always been made with wall from normal aorta. Atherosclerosis is a feature of aneurysmal disease and may therefore confound comparisons with normal wall. This study compared the expression and activity of cysteine proteases and their inhibitors in aneurysm wall with their expression in the aortic wall of patients with aortic occlusive disease (AOD).\nAortic wall was obtained from 82 patients with AAA and 13 with AOD. Protein expression and activity of cathepsin B, H, K, L and S, and cystatins A, B, and C were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and specific fluorogenic substrate assays. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity was measured by quantitative bioimmunoassay in the same extracts.\nAAA wall had 330% more cathepsin H protein (P = .007) and >30% less cystatin C (P = .03) than the aortic wall from patients with AOD. The activity of cathepsins B, H, L, and S was significantly greater in AAA than AOD (376%, [P < .0001], 191%, [P = 0.019], 223%, P = 0.002, and approximately 20% [P = 0.045] respectively). MMP-9 activity was also increased in AAA compared with AOD (P<0.0001) and levels in the wall of AAA correlated positively with cathepsin L activity (r = 0.42, P<.0001) and negatively with cystatin C (r = -0.75, P<.0001).\nThe activity of four cathepsins B, H, L, and S was higher in the aneurysm wall than in aortic wall of patients with occlusive disease. This was associated with a reduced level of cystatin C in the aneurysmal wall. Cathepsin H was the only protein in which there was a correlation between protein level and activity, which suggests that post-translational modifications were responsible for activation of the other cathepsins. Increased cathepsin activity may influence the activity of MMP-9, which is thought to have an important role in aneurysm development.",

    "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) is a bioactive sphingolipid that stimulates the migration of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) through G-protein coupled receptors; it has been shown to activate reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NAD[P]H) oxidase. The role of phospholipase C (PLC) in oxygen free radical generation, and the regulation of VSMC migration in response to S-1-P, are poorly understood.\nRat arterial VSMC were cultured in vitro. Oxygen free radical generation was measured by fluorescent redox indicator assays in response to S-1-P (0.1microM) in the presence and absence of the active PLC inhibitor (U73122; U7, 10nM) or its inactive analog U73343 (InactiveU7, 10nM). Activation of PLC was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting for the phosphorylated isozymes (beta and gamma). Small interfering (si) RNA to the G-proteins Galphai, Galphaq, and Galpha12/13 was used to downregulate specific proteins. Statistics were by one-way analysis of variance (n = 6).\nS-1-P induced time-dependent activation of PLC-beta and PLC-gamma; PLC-beta but not PLC-gamma activation was blocked by U7 but not by InactiveU7. PLC-beta activation was Galphai-independent (not blocked by pertussis toxin, a Galphai inhibitor, or Galphai2 and Galphai3 siRNA) and Galphaq-independent (not blocked by glycoprotein [GP] 2A, a Galphaq inhibitor, or Galphaq siRNA). PLC-beta activation and cell migration was blocked by siRNA to Galpha12/13. Oxygen free radical generation induced by S-1-P, as measured by dihydroethidium staining, was significantly inhibited by U7 but not by InactiveU7. Inhibition of oxygen free radicals with the inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium resulted in decreased cell migration to S-1-P. VSMC mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and VSMC migration in response to S-1-P was inhibited by PLC- inhibition.\nS-1-P induces oxygen free radical generation through a Galpha12/13, PLC-beta-mediated mechanism that facilitates VSMC migration. To our knowledge, this is the first description of PLC-mediated oxygen free radical generation as a mediator of S-1-P VSMC migration and illustrates the need for the definition of cell signaling to allow targeted strategies in molecular therapeutics for restenosis.",

This study reports the long-term outcome of ELT in a series of 500 patients.\nIncompetent GSV segments in 500 patients (436 women, 64 men) with a mean age of 52.6 years (range, 19 to 83 years) were treated with intraluminal ELT using a 980-nm diode laser (Pharaon, Osyris, France). The GSV diameter was measured by Duplex examination in an upright position in different GSV segments (1.5 cm below the saphenofemoral junction, crural segment, condylar segment, and sural segment). These measurements were used to determine the optimal linear endovenous energy density (LEED) for each segment. During treatment, patients were maintained in the Trendelenburg position. Patients were evaluated clinically and by duplex scanning at 1 and 8 days, 1 and 6 months, and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years to assess treatment efficacy and adverse reactions.\nA total of 511 GSVs were treated. The mean diameter was 7.5 mm (range, 2.4 to 15.0). The LEED was tuned as a function of the initial GSV diameter measured in the orthostatic position, from 50 J/cm (3 mm) up to 120 J/cm (15 mm). At the 1-week follow-up, 9.3% of the patients reported moderate pain. In the immediate postoperative period, the closure rate was 98.0% and remained constant during the 4-year follow-up to reach 97.1%. After 1 year, a complete disappearance of the GSV or minimal residual fibrous cord was noted. Major complications have not been detected; in particular, no deep venous thrombosis. Ecchymoses were seen in 60%, transitory paresthesia was observed in 7%. There was no dyschromia, superficial burns, thrombophlebitis, or palpable indurations. Complementary phlebectomy was done in 98% of patients. Failures occurred only in large veins (saphenofemoral junction diameter >1.1 cm or for GSV truncular diameter >0.8 cm)\nELT of the incompetent GSV with a 980-nm diode laser appears to be an extremely safe technique, particularly when the energy applied is calculated as a function of the GSV diameter. It is associated with only minor effects. Currently, ELT has become the method of choice for treating superficial veins and has almost replaced the treatment of traditional ligation and stripping.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of stripping the below knee great saphenous vein (GSV) segment on varicose vein recurrence as well as any disability induced after saphenous nerve injury (SNI) during a 5-year period.\nOne hundred and six limbs (86 patients, 64 female, mean age 46 years), that underwent GSV stripping, to the knee or ankle level, were prospectively followed up at 1 month and 5 years postoperatively with clinical examination and color duplex imaging (CDI), in order to evaluate SNI and the development of recurrence. The extent of GSV stripping complied with preoperative CDI in 84 limbs (79%) that were subjected to GSV stripping to the ankle and full abolishment of duplex-confirmed reflux. Furthermore, 19 limbs (18%) underwent stripping restricted to the below knee level since the distal GSV was competent. On the contrary, in three limbs (3%), the extent of stripping did not comply with preoperative CDI due to the absence of varicosities in the tibia, and stripping was restricted to the knee level, although they had reflux along the whole GSV length.\nOverall recurrence was found in 24 out of 106 operated limbs (23%) after 5 years. Recurrence was found to be 20% (17/84) in the limbs with total GSV stripping and 32% (7/22) in the limbs with restricted GSV stripping (P > .05). However, the recurrence rate in the tibial area was significantly lower in limbs subjected to GSV stripping, which was in compliance with the preoperative CDI (9/103, 9%) compared with those that had undergone GSV stripping that was not in agreement with the preoperative CDI (3/3, 100%; P < .005). Neurological examination at 1 month postoperatively, revealed SNI in 17 limbs (16%). However, at the 5-year neurological reassessment, we found that seven out of these limbs (40%) were alleviated from SNI adverse symptoms presenting only deficits in sensation. In addition, no significance was found concerning SNI between limbs subjected to total and restricted GSV stripping (16/84 vs 1/22; P > .05).\nThough SNI may occur after both restricted and total GSV stripping, this does not influence limb disability since any related symptoms seem to regress in almost half of the limbs 5 years postoperatively. Additionally, it seems that recurrence could be reduced in the tibial area if the level of GSV stripping complies with the extent of the ultrosonographically proven GSV reflux. Therefore, the extent of GSV stripping should not be guided by the intent of avoiding SNI.",

    "abstract": "Trauma to the head and neck with military munitions often presents with complex multisystem injury patterns. Vascular evaluation typically focuses on the carotid and vertebral arteries; however, trauma to branches of the external carotid artery may also result in devastating complications. Pseudoaneurysms are the most frequent finding on delayed evaluation and can result in life-threatening episodes of rebleeding.\nPatients evacuated from the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts with penetrating injury to the face and neck were evaluated by the vascular surgery service to determine the potential for unsuspected vascular injury. Patients with significant penetrating injury underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the initial evaluation and subsequent arteriography in cases where injuries were suspected or metallic fragments produced artifacts obscuring the vasculature. Data on all vascular evaluations were entered prospectively into a database and retrospectively reviewed.\nBetween February 2003 and March 2007, 124 patients were evaluated for significant penetrating trauma to the head and neck. Thirteen pseudoaneurysms of the head and neck were found in 11 patients: two in the internal carotid artery, one of the vertebral artery, and 10 involving branches of the external carotid. Seven pseudoaneurysms were symptomatic, of which two presented with episodes of massive bleeding and airway compromise. Seven pseudoaneurysms were treated with coil embolization, 1 with Gelfoam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Mich) embolization, 2 with stent grafts, 2 with open repair, and 1 with observation alone. None of the patients undergoing embolization had complications; however, a stent graft of the internal carotid artery occluded early, without stroke. All of the pseudoaneurysms had resolved on follow-up CTA or angiogram.\nPseudoaneurysms are a common finding in patients with high-velocity gunshot wounds or blast injuries to the head and neck. Most involve branches of the external carotid artery and can be treated by embolization. CTA should be performed on all patients with high-velocity gunshot wounds or in cases of blast trauma with fragmentation injuries of the head and neck.",

    "abstract": "The application of endovascular technology for the emergency treatment of traumatic vascular injuries is a new frontier. This study examines recent nationwide use of endovascular therapy in acute arterial traumatic injuries.\nThis retrospective study used the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). Cases with a diagnosis of arterial vascular injury were identified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and procedure codes for endovascular therapy were selected. A descriptive analysis and multiple regressions were performed to identify variables predictive of outcomes.\nFrom 1994 to 2003, 12,732 arterial injuries were identified. Between 1997 (when the first endovascular repair was recorded in the NTDB) and 2003, 7286 open arterial repairs and 281 endovascular repairs were recorded for an overall utilization rate for endovascular procedures of 3.7%. The yearly number of endovascular procedures registered in the NTDB increased 27-fold, from four in 1997 to 107 in 2003. Use of stents substantially increased from 12 in 2000 to 30 in 2003; endograft use increased from one in 2000 to 37 in 2003. Nearly equal numbers of blunt (n = 134) and penetrating (n = 111) injuries were treated. The injury severity score (median, interquartile range [IRQ]) was significantly lower in patients who underwent an endovascular procedure at 13 (IRQ, 9 to 26) for trauma vs patients requiring an open procedure at 20 (IRQ, 10 to 34; P < .001), a finding corroborated by the lower number of associated injuries in patients undergoing endovascular repair (8.7 +/- 7.2 vs 13.0 +/- 16.1, P < .001). Using multivariable regression to control for differences in injury severity score and associated injuries, mortality was significantly lower for patients undergoing endovascular procedures (odds ratio, 0.18; P = .029) including those with an arterial injury of the torso or head and neck (odds ratio, 0.51, P = .007). Total length of hospital stay also tended to be lower for patients undergoing endovascular procedures by 18% (P = .064).\nThe use of endovascular therapy in the setting of acute trauma is increasing in a dramatic fashion and is being used to treat a wide variety of vessels injured by blunt and penetrating mechanisms. Endovascular therapy appears to be particularly suitable for patients who present with less severe injuries and greater hemodynamic stability.

Between 1997 (when the first endovascular repair was recorded in the NTDB) and 2003, 7286 open arterial repairs and 281 endovascular repairs were recorded for an overall utilization rate for endovascular procedures of 3.7%. The yearly number of endovascular procedures registered in the NTDB increased 27-fold, from four in 1997 to 107 in 2003. Use of stents substantially increased from 12 in 2000 to 30 in 2003; endograft use increased from one in 2000 to 37 in 2003. Nearly equal numbers of blunt (n = 134) and penetrating (n = 111) injuries were treated. The injury severity score (median, interquartile range [IRQ]) was significantly lower in patients who underwent an endovascular procedure at 13 (IRQ, 9 to 26) for trauma vs patients requiring an open procedure at 20 (IRQ, 10 to 34; P < .001), a finding corroborated by the lower number of associated injuries in patients undergoing endovascular repair (8.7 +/- 7.2 vs 13.0 +/- 16.1, P < .001). Using multivariable regression to control for differences in injury severity score and associated injuries, mortality was significantly lower for patients undergoing endovascular procedures (odds ratio, 0.18; P = .029) including those with an arterial injury of the torso or head and neck (odds ratio, 0.51, P = .007). Total length of hospital stay also tended to be lower for patients undergoing endovascular procedures by 18% (P = .064).",

We assessed the accuracy of auscultation for bruits and pulse palpation for identifying the presence of significant carotid stenosis, carotid plaque, femoral plaque, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.9 at ultrasonography.\nThe presence of a femoral bruit provided information on the presence of both an ABI <0.9 (positive likelihood ratio [+LR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63 to 5.16) and a femoral plaque (+LR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.22 to 4.71), and this information was independent from the cardiovascular risk factors. The absence of both pedal pulses also provided additional information, beyond risk factors, on the presence of an ABI <0.9 (+LR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.93 to 6.60). The presence of a carotid bruit did not affect the likelihood of carotid stenosis, plaque, or intima-media thickness above the median.\nUnlike carotid auscultation, pulse palpation and auscultation for femoral bruits provided valuable information on the presence of asymptomatic PAD and underlying atherosclerosis in apparently healthy subjects.",

    "abstract": "Advanced age is considered a relative contraindication for surgical revascularization in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Our aim was to analyze the usefulness of endovascular and surgical revascularization in patients older than 80 years with chronic critical leg ischemia (CLI). Our hypothesis was that the clinical benefit of lower extremity revascularization is limited in octogenarians.\nThis was a prospective cohort study with a 1-year follow-up. Subjects included a consecutive series (January 1999 to June 2004) of patients presenting with CLI. Revascularization cohorts were either open surgical or endovascular with conservatively treated patients as a reference group. Prospective follow-up occurred after 30 days and 2, 6, and 12 months. The primary end point was sustained clinical success, defined as a categorical upward shift in clinical symptoms according to Rutherford, without major amputation and without the need for repeated target extremity revascularization (TER). Secondary clinical success was defined accordingly, including repeated TER. Mortality, major amputation, and TER were separately calculated end points. All results were stratified for age categories of nonoctogenarians (<80 years) and octogenarians (> or =80 years). Cumulative outcome was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were assessed by log-rank tests. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Cox proportional regression.\nA total of 376 patients (158 women; mean age, 75.8 +/- 10.7 years) with 416 critically ischemic limbs were analyzed. Overall, 150 patients (39.9%) were older than 80 years, and 85 limbs were treated surgically (26 octogenarians; 30.6%), 207 limbs (96 octogenarians; 46.4%) were treated by endovascular means, and 124 limbs (45 octogenarians; 36.3%) were treated conservatively, including delayed revascularization procedures. Both sustained and secondary clinical success rates, as well as limb salvage rates, were higher in the revascularization cohorts as compared with conservatively treated patients, regardless of age category (P < .001, P < .001, and P = .006, respectively, by Cox proportional hazard model). Mortality was significantly higher in octogenarians (P = .006 by Cox proportional hazard model), particularly within 30 days after surgical revascularization (hazard ratio, 5.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-24.9). Patient age category did not affect the rate of major amputations or TER.\nIndividually tailored revascularization improves the outcome of CLI in octogenarians as well as in nonoctogenarians; even so, endovascular revascularization should be preferred in octogenarians because of the higher mortality associated with surgery.",

    "abstract": "The influence of operator-dependent variables on the outcomes of lower extremity bypass (LEB) surgery have primarily been reported in single-institution, retrospective studies. We utilized data from a prospective, multicenter trial to identify technical variables that were significantly associated with early and midterm results of autogenous LEB for limb salvage.\nThe PREVENT III trial database includes 1404 North American patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who underwent LEB using excised autogenous vein. The study protocol excluded claudicants and in situ reconstructions. Technical factors analyzed included vein diameter, conduit type, graft length, vein orientation, location of proximal and distal anastomoses, and performance of completion imaging. Univariate analysis was used to determine the effect of these factors on 30 day and 1-year outcomes. Multivariate Cox regression models evaluated the influence of these factors while adjusting for age, sex, race, tobacco, diabetes, dialysis-dependency, previous index limb bypass, and study drug (edifoligide) administration. The primary outcomes were primary patency (PP), primary assisted patency (PAP), and secondary patency (SP) assessed by Kaplan-Meier method.\nUnivariate analysis revealed that vein diameter <3.5 mm and composite graft type were significantly associated with early (30 day) graft failure. At 1 year, multivariate analysis revealed that patency rates were negatively associated with diameter <3.5 mm (PP, PAP, SP), non-great saphenous vein (GSV) type (PP, SP), and graft lengths >50 cm (PP only). Limb salvage and survival at 1 year were not significantly impacted by technical variables. Employing a prespecified trial definition of high-risk conduits (diameter <3mm or nonsingle segment GSV; 24% of entire cohort) revealed that use of such conduits was associated with a 2.1-fold increased risk of 30 day graft failure (P < .05), as well as reduced PP, PAP, and SP at 1 year. Use of a high-risk conduit was also associated with an increased index length of stay (mean 9.37 vs 8.71 days, P = .03) and a greater number of reinterventions (mean 0.67 vs 0.42, P < .0001) over the ensuing year.\nIn this large, multicenter cohort of patients undergoing LEB for CLI, vein diameter and conduit type were the dominant technical determinants of early and late graft failure. High-risk conduits and longer grafts may benefit from aggressive postoperative graft surveillance.",

At 1 year, multivariate analysis revealed that patency rates were negatively associated with diameter <3.5 mm (PP, PAP, SP), non-great saphenous vein (GSV) type (PP, SP), and graft lengths >50 cm (PP only). Limb salvage and survival at 1 year were not significantly impacted by technical variables. Employing a prespecified trial definition of high-risk conduits (diameter <3mm or nonsingle segment GSV; 24% of entire cohort) revealed that use of such conduits was associated with a 2.1-fold increased risk of 30 day graft failure (P < .05), as well as reduced PP, PAP, and SP at 1 year. Use of a high-risk conduit was also associated with an increased index length of stay (mean 9.37 vs 8.71 days, P = .03) and a greater number of reinterventions (mean 0.67 vs 0.42, P < .0001) over the ensuing year.",

    "abstract": "Distal embolization of plaque or thrombus may cause organ ischemia following percutaneous peripheral interventions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of particulate embolization during percutaneous superficial femoral artery (SFA) intervention by monitoring with continuous Doppler ultrasound. The rate and timing of embolization at various phases of intervention such as guidewire crossing, balloon angioplasty, stent deployment, and directional atherectomy were analyzed and compared.\nSixty patients underwent SFA intervention. Of these 60 patients, 10 patients underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone, 40 patients underwent PTA with stenting, and 10 patients underwent plaque excision with the SilverHawk atherectomy device (8) or Spectranetics excimer laser (2) with or without additional PTA or stent placement. A 4-MHz Doppler probe was used for continuous monitoring in the ipsilateral popliteal artery. Distal embolization was registered as embolic signals (ES). ES were quantitatively assessed during critical portions of the procedure including guidewire crossing, balloon angioplasty, stent deployment and/or atherectomy. ES during different phases of intervention were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nES was noted in every patient during wire crossing, angioplasty, stent deployment and atherectomy. The average number of ES noted during guidewire crossing was 8, PTA was 12, stent deployment was 28, SiverHawk atherectomy was 49, and Spectranetics excimer laser was 51. The frequency of ES was statistically higher during stent deployment vs wire crossing or balloon angioplasty but equivalent to that generated by plaque excision. ES was observed more frequent during balloon angioplasty than during wire crossing. In one patient who was treated with the excimer laser, a single runoff vessel was occluded with embolic debris but patency was restored angiographically after thrombolysis. The patient went on to require below knee amputation. During follow-up, all patients with claudication reported improved symptoms and those with ulcers or gangrene demonstrated healing. The average increase in ankle-brachial index following intervention was 0.31.\nWhile ES were recorded at each step of SFA intervention, the frequency was greatest during stent deployment. Despite the frequency of these events, only one patient developed angiographically and clinically significant embolization. Thus, our findings do not support the routine use of protection devices during percutaneous SFA intervention.",

    "abstract": "Most studies on outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have focused on the major complications of death and stroke. Less is known about minor but more common surgical complications such as hematoma, cranial nerve palsy, and wound infection. This study used data from a large, population-based cohort study to describe the incidence of minor surgical complications after CEA and examine associations between minor and major complications.\nThe New York Carotid Artery Surgery (NYCAS) study examined all Medicare beneficiaries who underwent CEA from January 1998 to June 1999 in NY State. Detailed clinical information on preoperative characteristics and complications < or =30 days of surgery was abstracted from hospital charts. Associations between minor (cranial nerve palsies, hematoma, and wound infection) and major complications (death/stroke) were examined with chi(2) tests and multivariate logistic regression.\nThe NYCAS study had data on 9308 CEAs performed by 482 surgeons in 167 hospitals. Overall, 10% of patients had a minor surgical complication (cranial nerve (CN) palsy, 5.5%; hematoma, 5.0%; and wound infection, 0.2%). Cardiac complications occurred in 3.9% (myocardial 1.1%, unstable angina 0.9%, pulmonary edema 2.1%, and ventricular tachycardia 0.8%). In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, the occurrence of any minor surgical complication, CN palsy alone, or hematoma alone was associated with 3 to 4-fold greater odds of perioperative stroke or combined risk of death and nonfatal stroke (P < 0.0001). Patients with cardiac complications had 4 to 5-fold increased odds of stroke or combined risk of death and stroke.\nMinor surgical complications are common after CEA and are associated with much higher risk of death and stroke. Patient factors, process factors, and direct causality are involved in this relationship, but future work will be needed to better understand their relative contributions.",

    "abstract": "Proximal and distal carotid tortuosity is considered of paramount importance in carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures. Specifically, distal internal carotid coiling or kinking is thought to interfere with proper distal protection devices, thus contraindicating CAS. The type of the aortic arch is also considered a key factor in CAS success; however, no standardized method of evaluation of these indicators is available in the literature. We have evaluated the impact of arch angulation and proximal and distal tortuosity in a series of CAS procedures.\nIn patients undergoing CAS, arch angulation and tortuosity of both common and distal internal carotid arteries were evaluated prospectively by calculating the sum of all angles diverging from the ideal straight axis, considering a 90 degrees ideal angle for the origin from the arch (tortuosity index, TI). All procedures were through a transfemoral approach and with distal protection. Results were correlated with technical procedural success (residual stenosis <30%) and neurologic complication by Student t test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of results.\nIn a group of 298 CAS procedures, the mean proximal TI was 111.9 degrees +/- 96.77 degrees and the mean distal TI was 123.4 degrees +/- 117.47 degrees . Technical success was obtained in 272 patients (91.2%). Causes for the 26 technical failures were incapacity to obtain stable proximal access in 25 (96.1%), and uncrossable stenosis in one (3.9%). Neurologic protection was achieved with distal filters in all cases. Neurologic complications occurred in 23 patients (7.7%), consisting of 16 transient ischemic attacks and seven minor strokes. The proximal TI was significantly greater in the 26 cases of technical failure (158.4 degrees +/- 102.2 degrees vs 107.6 degrees +/- 95.3 degrees , P = .01). The distal TI was not different in the two groups (89 degrees +/- 99.1 degrees vs 126.5 degrees +/- 118.6 degrees , P = .11). Similarly, the proximal TI was significantly greater in neurologic complications (162.8 degrees +/- 111.8 degrees vs 107.6 degrees +/- 18.2 degrees , P = .03); the distal TI was not different in the two groups (112.6 degrees +/- 110.1 degrees vs 124.3 degrees +/- 96.1 degrees , P = .5) By logistic regression analysis, a proximal TI >150 was an independent predictor of both neurologic complications and technical failure. Age was also independently associated with technical failure. Appropriate distal filter placement was possible in all cases with a crossable stenosis, irrespective of the internal carotid TI.\nThe proximal TI is significantly associated with both technical success and neurologic complications after CAS, whereas the distal TI did not influence either outcome. The presence of distal kinking or coiling should not be considered a contraindication to CAS.",

This study compared in-hospital postoperative stroke and mortality rates after CAS and CEA at the national level.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify all patient-discharges that occurred for revascularization of carotid artery stenosis. The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes for CEA (38.12), CAS (00.63), and insertion of noncoronary stents (39.50, 39.90) were used in conjunction with the diagnostic codes for carotid artery stenosis, with (433.11) and without (433.10) stroke. Primary outcome measures included in-hospital postoperative stroke and death rates. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate independent predictors of postoperative stroke and mortality. Adjustment was made for age, sex, medical comorbidities, admission diagnosis, procedure type, year, and hospital type.\nDuring the calendar years 2003 and 2004, an estimated 259,080 carotid revascularization procedures were performed in the United States. CAS had a higher rate of in-hospital postoperative stroke (2.1% vs 0.88%, P < .0001) and higher postoperative mortality (1.3% vs 0.39%) than CEA. For asymptomatic patients (92%), the postoperative stroke rate was significantly higher for CAS than CEA (1.8% vs 0.86%, P < .0001), but the mortality rate was similar (0.44% vs 0.36%, P = .36). For symptomatic patients (8%), the rates for postoperative stroke (4.2% vs 1.1%, P < .0001) and mortality (7.5% vs 1.0%, P < .0001) were significantly higher after CAS. By multivariate regression, CAS was independently predictive of postoperative stroke (odds ratio [OR], 2.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91 to 3.25). CAS was also associated with in-hospital postoperative mortality for asymptomatic (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.84) and symptomatic (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.89 to 3.69) patients.\nAs determined from a large representative national sample including the years 2003 and 2004, the in-hospital stroke rate after CAS for asymptomatic patients was twofold higher than after CEA. For symptomatic patients, the respective in-hospital stroke and mortality rates were fourfold and sevenfold higher. These unexpected results indicate that further randomized controlled trials with homogenous symptomatic and asymptomatic patient groups should be performed.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic disease may be associated with severe neurologic complications. The current study used the data of a multicenter registry to assess of the incidence and the risk factors for paraplegia or paraparesis and intracranial stroke.\nThe European Collaborators on Stent/Graft Techniques for Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) database prospectively enrolled 606 patients. Thoracic pathologies with urgent or elective presentation, which included degenerative aneurysm in 291, aortic dissection in 215, traumatic rupture in 67, anastomotic false aneurysm in 24, and infectious or nonspecified disorders in 9. Study end points included evidence of perioperative spinal cord ischemia (SCI) or stroke. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression models were used to assess the significance of clinical factors that potentially influenced the occurrence of neurological sequelae.\nParaplegia or paraparesis developed in 15 patients (2.5%) and stroke in 19 (3.1%); two patients had both complications. At multivariate regression analysis, independent correlation with SCI was observed for four factors: (1) left subclavian artery covering without revascularization (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; P = .027), (2) renal failure (OR, 3.6; P = .02), (3) concomitant open abdominal aorta surgery (OR, 5.5; P = .037) and (4) three or more stent grafts used (OR, 3.5; P = .043). In patients with perioperative stroke, two correlating factors were identified: (1) duration of the intervention (OR, 6.4; P = .0045) and (2) female sex (OR, 3.3; P = .023). A neurologic complication (paraplegia or stroke) developed in 8.4% of the patients in whom left subclavian covering was required compared with 0% of patients with prophylactic revascularization (P = .049).\nPerioperative paraplegia or paraparesis was significantly associated with blockage of the left subclavian artery without revascularization. The clinical significance of this source of collateral perfusion of the spinal cord had not been confirmed previously. Intracranial stroke was associated with lengthy manipulation of wires, catheters, and introducer sheaths within the aortic arch, reflected by a longer duration of the procedure.",

    "abstract": "A significant increase in the frequency of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement at our large community-based academic health center led us to evaluate changes in indications, devices, and providers over the past decade.\nA single-center retrospective review of all filter placements was performed comparing 76 patients in 1995 with 470 patients in 2005. Demographic data, provider data, filter type, and indications for placement were tabulated. Complications, follow-up evaluation, filter removal, and patient outcomes were examined.\nThere was a greater than sixfold increase in the number of filters placed in 2005 vs 1995. There were no significant differences in patient demographics or the extent of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease during this period except for an increase in median age. Filter placement by interventional radiologists remained approximately 50% of the total whereas placement by vascular/trauma surgeons increased to 24% and placement by cardiologists decreased to 29% (P < .001). In 2005, a smaller percentage of filters were placed for absolute indications, while filter placements for relative and prophylactic indications increased over the same time period, especially among cardiologists (P = .02). Potentially retrievable filters are increasingly being used for prophylaxis; however, only 2.4% were retrieved. An increasing number of filters were placed in patients with only infrapopliteal deep venous thrombosis (P = .07). A shift was seen to lower profile and removable filter types. Long-term patient follow-up showed little change in disease progression or in morbidity and mortality of filter insertion.\nTechnological and practice pattern changes have led to an increase in filters inserted by vascular and trauma surgeons in the operating room and intensive care units. Increased diagnosis of VTE disease and newer low profile delivery systems in patients may also have contributed to the significant increase in filter placement. A shift in indications for placement from absolute toward relative indications and prophylaxis is evident over time and across providers, indicating the need for consensus development of appropriate criteria.",

Patients were separated into two groups: group 1 (n = 65) had OAR before and group 2 (n = 46) after an EVAR program was adopted at the medical school in mid-2000. Perioperative death and morbidity, location of proximal aortic clamp, management of the left renal vein, associated iliac aneurysmal or occlusive diseases, the type of surgical reconstruction, operating time, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital were recorded. All the data were compared between the two groups.\nRetroperitoneal approach, suprarenal clamping, left renal vein division, and longer operating room time were statistically more common in group 2 (36.9% vs 12.3%, P = .002; 15.2% vs 3.1%, P = .032; 23.9% vs 7.7%, P = .026; and 117 +/- 8 min vs 95 +/-7 min, P < .001, respectively). Although group 2 had significantly more iliac aneurysms (52.1% vs 32.3%; P = .036), the number of bifurcated reconstructions was comparable. The overall perioperative mortality rate was 1.8% (2 of 111), and the figures for groups 1 and 2 were comparable (3.1% vs 0%; P = .510). No deaths were cardiac related. Group 2 had a significantly higher incidence of kidney failure (8.7% vs 0%; P = .027).

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture occurs when wall stress exceeds wall strength. Engineering principles suggest that aneurysm diameter is only one aspect of its geometry that influences wall stress. Finite element analysis considers the complete geometry and determines wall stresses throughout the structure. This article investigates the interoperator and intraoperator reliability of finite element analysis in the calculation of peak wall stress (PWS) in AAA and examines the variation in PWS in elective and acute AAAs.\nFull ethics and institutional approval was obtained. The study recruited 70 patients (30 acute, 40 elective) with an infrarenal AAA. Computed tomography (CT) images were obtained of the AAA from the renal vessels to the aortic bifurcation. Manual edge extraction, three-dimensional reconstruction, and blinded finite element analysis were performed to ascertain location and value of PWS. Ten CT data sets were analyzed by four different operators to ascertain interoperator reliability and by one operator twice to ascertain intraoperator reliability. An intraclass correlation coefficient was obtained. The Mann-Whitney U test and independent samples t test compared groups for statistical significance.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.71 for interoperator reliability and 0.84 for intraoperator reliability. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean (SD) maximal AAA diameter between elective (6.47 [1.30] cm) and acute (7.08 [1.39] cm) patients (P = .073). The difference in PWS between elective (0.67 [0.30] MPa) and acute (1.11 [0.51] MPa) patients (P = .008) was statistically significant, however.\nInteroperator and intraoperator reliability in the derivation of PWS is acceptable. PWS, but not maximal diameter, was significantly higher in acute AAAs than in elective AAAs.",

One compelling reason to update these recommendations is that vascular surgery as a specialty has continued to evolve with a significant shift towards endovascular therapies. The Society for Vascular Surgery is making the following four recommendations concerning guidelines for hospital privileges for vascular and endovascular surgery. First, anyone applying for new hospital privileges to perform vascular surgery should have completed an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical-accredited vascular surgery residency and should obtain American Board of Surgery certification in vascular surgery within 3 years of completion of their training. Second, we reaffirm and provide updated recommendations concerning previous established guidelines for peripheral endovascular procedures, thoracic and abdominal aortic endograft replacements, and carotid artery balloon angioplasty and stenting for trainees and already credentialed physicians who are adding these new procedures to their hospital credentials. Third, we endorse the Residency Review Committee for Surgery recommendations regarding open and endovascular cases during vascular residency training. Fourth, we endorse the Inter-societal Commission for Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) recommendations for noninvasive vascular laboratory interpretations and examinations to become a registered physician in vascular interpretation (RPVI) or a registered vascular technologist (RVT).",

    "abstract": "The use of carotid stenting in octogenarian patients is controversial; some authors consider this population at high risk for the procedure. Anatomic vascular complexity may be an important reason for the high reported rates of periprocedural thromboembolic complications. Transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting (TCS) with flow reversal avoids aortic arch instrumentation. In this study, we analyzed our experience with TCS in octogenarian patients and compared the results with those of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the same age group in terms of safety.\nThe study included 81 patients, > or =80 years, a retrospective cohort of 45 consecutive patients treated with CEA (January 2002 to January 2005), and a prospective cohort of 36 consecutive patients treated with TCS with protective flow reversal (January 2005 to January 2007). Patients were considered symptomatic according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria. Stenting indication was established on the SAPPHIRE criteria. General anesthesia was used in patients undergoing CEA, and local anesthesia in those receiving TCS. Primary endpoints were: stroke, death, or acute myocardial infarction within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were peripheral nerve paralysis and cervical hematoma. Statistical significance for between-group differences was assessed by Pearson chi(2) or Fisher exact test, and Student t test. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Follow-up was limited to 30 days.\nBaseline epidemiological characteristics and revascularization indications were similar between both groups. Mean age was significantly higher in the TCS group (83.5 +/- 3.35) than the CEA group (81.7 +/- 1.55) (P = .004). Percentage of symptomatic lesions was similar: 30.6% in TCS vs 44.4% in CEA (P = .2). Comorbid conditions (respiratory or cardiac) were more frequent in TCS group (61.6% vs 26.6%; P = .002). There were no significant differences between groups for the primary endpoints: 4.4% (one stroke, one acute myocardial infarction) for CEA vs 0% for TCS (P = .5). Among CEA patients, there were two peripheral nerve palsies (4.4%) and one cervical hematoma (2.2%); there were no such complications with TCS (P = .5 and P = 1, respectively). In one asymptomatic TCS patient, Doppler study at 24 hours following the procedure showed a common carotid artery dissection, which was treated by a common carotid to internal carotid bypass.\nIn this preliminary experience, transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting with flow reversal for cerebral protection was as safe at short term as carotid endarterectomy in octogenarian patients, who additionally had considerable comorbidity; thus, it may be possible to extend the indications for carotid revascularization in this population. Studies in larger patient series are required to confirm the trends observed in this study.",

    "abstract": "Management using femoral-popliteal vein (FPV) of aortic graft infections, failing aortofemoral bypass, and aortoiliac occlusive disease in young patients with a small aorta is now an accepted therapeutic method and is performed frequently at our institution. A high reintervention rate for FPV graft stenosis has recently been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of FPV graft failure due to stenosis after neoaortoiliac system (NAIS) reconstruction, and to identify risk factors for this complication.\nA review was performed of 240 patients who underwent NAIS reconstruction at our institution between January 1991 and December 2005. All patients were entered into a prospective database and were evaluated for the incidence of vein graft stenosis requiring reintervention, risk factors for stenosis, and the rate and type of reintervention required to assist patency. Patients with occlusion are evaluated and reported, but excluded from detailed analysis. Risk factors assessed included gender, operative features, FPV size (diameter), smoking history, and medical comorbidities.\nOf the 240 NAIS procedures performed during this time period, 11 (4.6%) patients have required 12 graft revisions (one patient required a second intervention) for stenosis using open and endovascular techniques. Over the same time period, graft occlusion occurred in nine patients (3.8%). This provided a primary patency at 2 and 5 years of 87% and 82%, and an assisted primary patency rate of 96% and 94%. Mean time to revision was 23.5 months (range 5.5 to 83.5 months). Median FPV graft size in the nonrevised patients was 7.8 mm (range 4.0 to 11.4 mm), and 6.4 mm (range 4.7 to 8.7 mm) in the revised group (P = .006). Survival analysis revealed small vein graft size (<7.2 mm), coronary artery disease (CAD), and extensive smoking history as independent predictors of time to stenosis (P = .002, .02, .01, respectively), with multivariable analysis confirming these results (P = .002, .06, .012). Patients with CAD combined with small graft size were found to be at especially high risk for stenosis, with 8/36 (22.2%) requiring revision vs 3/184 (1.6%) of patients without both factors (P < .0001).\nFPV graft stenosis requiring revision after NAIS reconstruction is uncommon. Risk factors for stenosis include small graft size, history of CAD, and smoking. All patients merit aggressive counseling for smoking cessation, and patients exhibiting multiple risk factors should undergo close postoperative surveillance for graft stenosis.",

Results plus 1-year follow-up data analyzed at a central site are reported anonymously to each center at semiannual meetings where care processes and regional benchmarks are discussed.

Initial improvement efforts focused on optimizing preoperative medication usage.\nA total of 6143 operations were entered into the registry through December 2006. In-hospital stroke or death after CEA was 1.0%, major amputation or death after LEB was 3.8%, and mortality was 2.9% after elective open and 0.4% after endovascular repair. Variation in results between centers and surgeons provides opportunity for further quality improvement. Any postoperative complication increased median length of stay by > or =3 days.

    "abstract": "Ocular symptoms and signs often herald hemispheric neurological events associated with extracranial cerebrovascular disease. However, the presence of a Hollenhorst plaque (HP) or retinal artery occlusion (RAO) and the risk of stroke is unclear. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of all patients who presented with a HP or RAO at a single institution.\nBetween 2000 and 2005, the management and outcome of 130 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of HP, central RAO, or branch RAO (ICD-9 codes 362.30 to 362.33) were reviewed. Patients with transient monocular visual loss (amaurosis fugax), retinal venous occlusion, and other ocular pathologies were excluded. Electronic and hardcopy medical records were reviewed for demographic data, clinical variables, radiological, and noninvasive vascular lab testing. Duplex and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the carotid arteries were reviewed to confirm the presence of a lesion and quantify the degree of stenosis.\nDuring the study interval, 70 males and 60 females, with a mean age of 68 +/- 16 (+/-SD) years underwent ophthalmologic evaluation. Symptoms were present in 61% of patients and included eye pain, blurred vision, or atypical visual symptoms, while 39% were asymptomatic. Atherosclerotic risk factors in this population included the presence of hypertension (73%), diabetes (33%), hyperlipidemia (75%), and tobacco use (38%). A majority of patients underwent carotid interrogation via Duplex imaging (68%). Carotid bifurcation stenoses ipsilateral to the ocular findings were <30% in 68% of the patients, between 30 and 60% in 22% and >60% in only 8% of patients. Six patients with lesions greater than 60% went on to have either a carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting. Follow-up data on this group ranged from 1 to 49 months (median, 22 months), with no stroke or transient ischemic attack identified. There were five deaths during follow-up; none related to stroke. Serial carotid Duplex examinations failed to identify progression of carotid stenoses in this group of patients. Overall survival was 94% at 36 months for this cohort.\nThe presence of a HP or RAO is associated with a low prevalence of extracranial cerebrovascular disease that requires intervention. Furthermore, in contradistinction to amaurosis fugax, these ocular findings are not associated with a high risk for hemispheric neurological events.",

Six patients with lesions greater than 60% went on to have either a carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting. Follow-up data on this group ranged from 1 to 49 months (median, 22 months), with no stroke or transient ischemic attack identified. There were five deaths during follow-up; none related to stroke. Serial carotid Duplex examinations failed to identify progression of carotid stenoses in this group of patients. Overall survival was 94% at 36 months for this cohort.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the association of anatomic and temporal characteristics of graft-threatening lesions with the efficacy of percutaneous and open graft revision for failing infrainguinal vein grafts.\nConsecutive open and endovascular revisions for graft threatening lesions were reviewed. We evaluated graft durability and individual target lesion response to open and endovascular treatment to determine characteristics that may influence outcomes. Treatment failure was defined as target lesion restenosis or graft occlusion.\nEighty-four (58 endovascular, 26 open) infrainguinal vein graft revisions were performed in 67 failing, nonthrombosed infrainguinal vein grafts. Primary assisted graft patency at 5 years was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46% to 77%). Follow-up was 29.5 +/- 19.2 months. Grafts treated for early lesions (<6 months) failed (occlusion or need for additional interventions) more frequently than those with late occurring lesions (P = .03). Overall target lesion revascularization patency was 45% (95% CI, 32% to 58%) at 3 years. Average time to target lesion revascularization failure was 7.5 months, with no significant difference noted between endovascular and open treatment groups. Overall target lesion revascularization patency at 3 years was also not significantly different between open and endovascular groups at 54% (95% CI, 30% to 73%) vs 41% (95% CI, 25% to 56%; P = .15). When divided by early and late-occurring target lesions, endovascular treatment of early lesions was associated with inferior patency compared with open procedures; no difference in patency was seen between treatment groups for late lesions. When divided by target lesion location (anastomotic vs mid-graft), treatment for both proximal and distal anastomotic target lesion was associated with inferior patency compared with mid-graft revision at 32% (95% CI, 17% to 47%) vs 62% (95% CI, 37% to 87%) at 3 years (P = .03). In addition, although results of anastomotic target lesion treatment significantly favored open repair, even open repair of anastomotic target lesions was associated with a <50% patency rate at 3 years. In contrast, mid-graft target lesions treated with open revisions were uniformly successful compared with a 54% patency at 3 years with endovascular treatment (P = .24). Short lesions (<2 cm) fared equally well with either endovascular or open treatment. Univariate analysis noted only anastomotic treatment was associated with significantly increased odds of failure.\nGrafts that develop early lesions fare poorly regardless of treatment modality. Lesions involving anastomoses of failing grafts are better treated with open revision, but patency after treatment of such lesions is still worse than treatment of mid-graft lesions. In contrast, the method of treatment does not influence outcome after treatment of mid-graft target lesions. Thus, endovascular therapy should be reserved for focal, late-appearing lesions involving the mid-graft.",

    "abstract": "Studies using histologic examination and protein analysis of atherosclerotic plaques are increasingly being performed, but reproducibility of plaque histology and variation of plaque composition among different parts of the plaque, which are key to reliability of these studies, are relatively unexplored. Therefore, this study investigated the intraobserver and interobserver variability of plaque histology and spatial variability in plaque composition.\nAtherosclerotic plaques (n = 100) obtained during carotid endarterectomy were divided into 0.5-cm segments. Paraffin sections were stained and semiquantitatively analyzed (four categories: no, minor, moderate, and heavy) for fat, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, collagen, calcification, thrombus, and overall phenotype. First, to determine the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, two independent observers independently analyzed the plaques. Second, to investigate spatial variability in plaque composition, histologic appearances of the culprit lesions (0-segment) were compared with the histologic appearances of adjacent (+5 mm) and more distant (+10 mm) plaque segments of 30 specimens.\nThe kappa values for intraobserver variability of fat, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, collagen, calcifications, thrombus, and overall phenotype were 0.83, 0.85, 0.71, 0.63, 0.81, 0.80, and 0.86, respectively, and kappa values for interobserver variability were 0.68, 0.74, 0.54, 0.59, 0.82, 0.75, and 0.71, respectively. Comparison of the histologic scorings of adjacent segments revealed a mean kappa of 0.40 (range, 0.33 to 0.60). When the culprit segment was compared with the more distant segment, the mean kappa was 0.24; however, in 91% of cases, the difference between the culprit segment and the distal segment was one category or less.\nSemiquantitative analysis of carotid atherosclerotic plaque histology was well reproducible, both intraobserver and interobserver. Although variation between different plaque segments in histologic appearance was observed, differences were small in almost all cases. Variability in histologic examination needs to be taken into account in studies comparing plaque imaging with histopathology and plaque research studies.",

    "abstract": "Data supporting the utility of percutaneous treatment to maintain vein graft patency have been limited to a collection of single-institution, retrospective analyses. Using the prospective, multi-institutional PREVENT III database, we sought to define the outcomes for endovascular vs surgical vein bypass graft revision and to define predictors for the success or failure of these interventions.\nA nested cohort study of 1404 patients in the PREVENT III trial who underwent infrainguinal vein bypass grafting for critical limb ischemia was performed to identify those patients who underwent either open surgical or endovascular graft revision. All patients in PREVENT III were followed up for 1 year from the initial bypass operation. The following were modeled as end points from the time of the initial open surgical or endovascular revision: freedom from graft reintervention, occlusion, amputation, and death.\nA total of 156 open surgical and 134 endovascular reinterventions were performed, with a mean follow-up after revision of 193 and 151 days, respectively. Although the demographics for each group were similar, the choice of repair was influenced by the interval between the index graft placement and the initial revision, with a high percentage of the early graft revisions treated with an open surgical procedure (0-1 months: 84% open surgical vs 16% endovascular; P < .001). The primary end point (ie, failure resulting in repeat graft revision, graft occlusion, or major amputation) was reached in 30.2% of the endovascular and 26.2% of the open surgical individuals, with significant improvements in the durability of graft revisions noted in the open surgical group (12-month amputation-/revision-free survival of 75% for the open surgical and 56% for the endovascular group; hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-5.26; P = .043). Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed this benefit to be most profound within the subset of thrombosed grafts undergoing salvage (P = .006). For revisions performed to treat graft stenosis, early outcomes were similar, with a trend favoring the open surgical group developing beyond 6 months. Although 80% of open surgical and 64% of endovascular-revised grafts required no further intervention, endovascular revisions necessitated significantly more reinterventions to maintain patency. The mean hospital lengths of stay (open surgical, 2.1 days; endovascular, 1.7 days) and quality of life at completion of the study (VascuQoL: open surgical, 4.72; endovascular, 4.76) were similar between the groups.\nOpen surgical revision of infrainguinal vein grafts provides an increased freedom from further reinterventions or major amputation, but early success rates for endovascular procedures were similar, particularly for nonoccluded grafts. With time, endovascular revisions necessitate an increasing number of reinterventions and manifest higher rates of failure.",

    "abstract": "Carotid intraplaque hemorrhage is a marker of atheroma instability. Noninvasive assessment of bleeding can be performed by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but its association with inflammatory markers has not been clearly demonstrated.\nWe evaluated consecutive carotid endarterectomy patients that underwent high-resolution MRI, independent evaluation of neurologic symptoms, C-reactive protein measurement, and histologic analysis. Intraplaque hemorrhage was determined by the presence of a hyperintense MRI signal (T1-weighted sequence).\nThe study included 70 predominantly male (66%) and hypertensive (89%) patients (89%) aged 66 +/- 9 years old. MR angiography identified 15 patients (21.5%) with stenosis between 50% and 69%, 15 (21.5%) with stenosis between 70% and 90%, and 40 (57%) with stenosis >90%. High-resolution MRI depicted a hyperintense signal suggestive of intraplaque bleeding in 45 subjects (64%). All patients who had had transient ischemic attacks >90 days before the surgery showed a hyperintense signal on MRI (P = .007). Age, gender, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and history of myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial disease were similar in patients with or without signs of intraplaque bleeding on MRI. There was excellent agreement between acute or recent hemorrhage on histologic and MRI findings (kappa coefficient, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.00). Only one of 45 patients (2%) with a hyperintense signal on MRI did not have acute or recent hemorrhage in the histologic analysis (P < .001). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were similar for different degrees of carotid stenosis as assessed by MR angiography, but they were significantly higher in clinically unstable patients (P = .006) and in those with a positive hyperintense MRI signal (P = .01). In an aggregated analysis of neurologic symptoms and MRI findings, we found a progressive increase of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (P = .02).\nIntraplaque hemorrhage evaluated by MRI identified neurologically unstable patients with increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein regardless of the degree of carotid stenosis.",

MR angiography identified 15 patients (21.5%) with stenosis between 50% and 69%, 15 (21.5%) with stenosis between 70% and 90%, and 40 (57%) with stenosis >90%. High-resolution MRI depicted a hyperintense signal suggestive of intraplaque bleeding in 45 subjects (64%). All patients who had had transient ischemic attacks >90 days before the surgery showed a hyperintense signal on MRI (P = .007). Age, gender, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and history of myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial disease were similar in patients with or without signs of intraplaque bleeding on MRI. There was excellent agreement between acute or recent hemorrhage on histologic and MRI findings (kappa coefficient, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.00). Only one of 45 patients (2%) with a hyperintense signal on MRI did not have acute or recent hemorrhage in the histologic analysis (P < .001). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were similar for different degrees of carotid stenosis as assessed by MR angiography, but they were significantly higher in clinically unstable patients (P = .006) and in those with a positive hyperintense MRI signal (P = .01). In an aggregated analysis of neurologic symptoms and MRI findings, we found a progressive increase of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (P = .02).",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of death after gastric bypass procedures for obesity, approximating 0.5% to 4%. All bariatric patients, but especially the super-obese, which have a body mass index (BMI) >50 kg/m(2), are at significant risk for postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE). Visualization and weight limitations of fluoroscopy tables exclude most bariatric and all super-obese patients from inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement using fluoroscopy. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided IVC filter placement is the only modality that allows these high-risk patients to have an IVC filter placed.\nHospital and outpatient records of the 494 patients who underwent gastric bypass procedures from January 1, 2004, to May 31, 2006, were reviewed. All patients who had concurrent IVC filter placement with the use of IVUS guidance were selected. Comorbidities, outcomes, and complications were recorded.\nWe identified 27 patients with mean BMI of 70 +/- 3 kg/m(2); of these, 25 were super-obese (BMI >50 kg/m(2)). Procedures included five laparoscopic and 22 open gastric bypass operations. All patients underwent concurrent IVC filter placement using IVUS guidance. In addition to super-obesity, indications for IVC filter placement included history of VTE (n = 4), known hypercoagulable state (n = 2), and profound immobility (n = 21). Mean follow up was 293 +/- 40 days. Technical success rate was 96.3%. There were no catheter site complications. In one surviving patient, a nonfatal pulmonary embolism was detected by computed tomography 2 months postoperatively. Two patients died, and autopsy excluded VTE as the cause of death in both.\nThis study suggests efficacy of IVUS-guided IVC filter placement in preventing mortality from pulmonary embolism in high-risk bariatric patients, including the super-obese. IVUS-guided IVC filter placement can be safely performed with an excellent success rate in all bariatric patients, including the super-obese, who otherwise would not be candidates for IVC filter placement due to the limitations imposed by their large body habitus.",

    "abstract": "We sought to describe modes of failure and associated limb loss after infrainguinal polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafting in patients lacking a saphenous venous conduit and to define specific clinical or hemodynamic factors prognostic for bypass failure.\nWe identified 121 patients (mean age, 67 years; 90 men and 31 women) with determinable outcomes (minimum follow-up, 2 months; mean, 17 months) after 130 prosthetic infrainguinal bypasses between 1997 and 2005. Ischemic presentation was rest pain in 52%, tissue loss in 34%, and disabling claudication and/or popliteal aneurysm in 14%, with 24% of patients requiring a redo bypass. Distal targets were the above-knee (n = 44), distal popliteal (n = 27), or tibial/pedal (n = 59) arteries. Sixty-six (77%) of the below-knee (BK) target (distal popliteal or tibial) bypasses had distal anastomotic adjuncts (vein cuff or patch). Duplex graft surveillance was performed at 1, 4, and 7 months after surgery and twice yearly thereafter, with recording of midgraft velocities and imaging encompassing inflow and outflow vessels. Arteriography and open/endovascular intervention was performed for stenoses identified by duplex scanning (peak systolic velocity >300 cm/s; velocity ratio >3.5). An attempt was made to salvage occluded grafts by using catheter-directed thrombolysis or open techniques. Eighty-six patients (74% of BK bypasses) were placed on chronic warfarin therapy with a target international normalized ratio range between 2 and 3. Prognostic factors were identified by using univariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nThree-year primary, assisted, and secondary patency rates were 39%, 43%, and 59%, respectively, for all bypasses, with no difference noted between above-knee and BK grafts (P = .5). At 3 years, freedom from limb loss was 75%, and patient survival was only 70%, with no adverse effect on survival imparted by amputation. Sixty-nine total adverse events occurred as a result of thrombotic occlusion (n = 51), duplex scan-detected stenosis (n = 13), or graft infection (n = 5). Forty-nine percent of all initial graft occlusions eventually led to amputation. Twenty-three grafts (27% of 86 patients) in patients maintained on chronic warfarin were subtherapeutic at the time of occlusion. Use of a distal anastomotic adjunct with BK bypasses reduced graft thrombosis (35% with vs 60% without) but did not impart a significant patency advantage (P = .07). Multivariate analysis revealed low graft flow (midgraft velocity < or =45 cm/s; odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-19.2), use of warfarin (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 2.1-34.5), and therapeutic warfarin (OR, 24.6; 95% CI, 5.7-106) to be independently predictive for bypass patency. Graft patency was maintained in 89% of grafts remaining therapeutic on warfarin compared with only 55% of subtherapeutic or nonanticoagulated grafts (P < .001). Low-flow grafts (n = 61) occluded more frequently than higher-flow grafts (46% vs 13%; P < .001). Therapeutic warfarin augmented the patency of low-flow (P < .001) but not high-flow (P = .15) grafts.\nLow graft flow was a more common mode of prosthetic bypass failure than development of duplex scan-detected stenotic lesions during follow-up. Early duplex scanning may be more important for characterizing midgraft velocity and related thrombotic potential and selecting patients for chronic anticoagulation. Maintenance of therapeutic warfarin is paramount in optimizing prosthetic bypass patency and limb preservation.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the patterns of ambulatory activity in subjects with and without intermittent claudication.\nThe study participants were 98 subjects limited by intermittent claudication and 129 controls who were matched for age, gender, and race. Subjects were assessed on their ambulatory activity patterns for 1 week with a small, lightweight step activity monitor attached to the ankle using elastic Velcro (Velcro Industries BV, Manchester, NH) straps above the lateral malleolus of the right leg. The step activity monitor recorded the number of strides taken on a minute-to-minute basis, the time spent ambulating, and the time and number of strides measured at low (<15 strides/min), medium (15 to 30 strides/min), and high (>30 strides/min) cadences.\nSubjects with intermittent claudication took fewer total strides each day than the controls (3149 +/- 1557 strides/d vs 4230 +/- 1708 strides/d; P < .001) and fewer strides at medium (1228 +/- 660 strides/day vs 1638 +/- 724 strides/day; P = .001) and high (766 +/- 753 strides/day vs 1285 +/- 1029 strides/day; P < .001) cadences. Subjects with intermittent claudication also had a lower daily average cadence than the controls (11.8 +/- 2.9 strides/min vs 13.5 +/- 3.1 strides/min; P < .001) and spent less total time ambulating each day (264 +/- 109 min/day vs 312 +/- 96 min/day; P = .034), primarily at medium (58 +/- 30 min/day vs 75 +/- 32 min/day; P < .001) and at high (19 +/- 17 min/day vs 30 +/- 22 min/day; P = .001) cadences.\nIntermittent claudication is associated with lower total daily ambulatory activity owing both to less time ambulating and to fewer strides taken while ambulating, particularly at moderate and high cadences.",
