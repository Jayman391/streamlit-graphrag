We report a case of an aortoduodenal fistula after the use of this technique. Enlargement of the upper aneurysmal neck was followed by caudal migration of the major portion of the stent-graft, which resulted in kinking of the device in the aneurysmal sac. Ulcerations were found on adjacent portions of both the aneurysmal sac and the adjacent duodenum. Only the textile portion of the prosthetic contralateral limb separated the aortic lumen from the corresponding duodenal lumen.

    "abstract": "We have developed techniques to isolate endothelial cell (EC) progenitors from human peripheral and umbilical cord blood.\nHuman adult peripheral and umbilical cord blood monocytes were isolated by centrifugation, and progenitor cells were separated with the use of magnetic polystyrene beads that were coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the CD34 cell-membrane antigen. Cells were propagated in selective media, and developing cultures were immunostained for CD31, CD34, factor VIII, and vascular endothelial growth factor cell receptors. ECs that developed were transfected with a gene for prourokinase and used to line ePTFE grafts, which were evaluated in vitro in a pulsatile flow system.\nUmbilical cord monocyte cultures demonstrated colonies that resembled ECs at approximately 2 weeks, with growth being best supported by EC growth media plus 20% calf serum with iron. Immunostaining of colonies was positive for CD31 and factor VIII. After 18 days in culture, CD34(+) cells from adult peripheral blood were noted, which had the typical cobblestone appearance of ECs and immunostained positively for CD31 and factor VIII-related antigens. Cultures of umbilical cord-derived cells and adult peripheral blood-derived cells developed complex line formations within 1 week in culture that stained positively for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. Urokinase-transfected ECs were shown to overexpress urokinase. Prosthetic grafts lined with transfected cells showed 87.33% +/- 4.97% cell adherence after 2 hours in a pulsatile flow system at clinically relevant shear stress.\nWe conclude that endothelial progenitor cells can be isolated from human adult peripheral and umbilical cord blood and developed into EC cultures as a source of cells for vascular graft seeding and gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Oxidized lipids are believed to contribute to atherogenesis and may play a role in the development of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia in prosthetic vascular grafts. This study examines the hypothesis that clinically relevant graft material activates monocytes to oxidize low density lipoprotein (LDL).\nLDL and Dacron or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft material were incubated in the presence of U937 cells, a monocytic cell line. LDL oxidation was measured by conjugated dienes, lipid peroxides, thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances, and electrophoretic mobility. Cell production of superoxide was measured by ferricytochrome c reduction. Metal ion requirement was assessed with the metal chelators, ethylenediaminetetra-acidic acid, deferoxamine, and bathocuproinedisulfonic acid. To determine whether human monocytes were capable of being activated by Dacron graft material to oxidize LDL, freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes were also studied.\nIncubation of LDL with U937 cells and Dacron increased LDL oxidation by 5- to 20-fold. LDL incubated with ePTFE or U937 cells alone resulted in minimal oxidation. Dacron graft increased U937 cell production of superoxide by 4-fold, whereas ePTFE had no effect. Superoxide dismutase inhibited Dacron-activated U937 cell oxidation of LDL by greater than 50%, which indicates a role for superoxide. Ethylenediaminetetra-acidic acid, deferoxamine, and bathocuproinedisulfonic acid each inhibited Dacron-activated U937 cell oxidation of LDL. Human peripheral blood monocytes were activated by Dacron graft material to oxidize LDL; superoxide dismutase inhibited Dacron-activated human monocytic oxidation of LDL, which suggests a role for superoxide.\nThese results suggest that Dacron graft material activates monocytes to oxidize LDL by a mechanism that involves superoxide and requires iron and copper ions. Our work suggests a mechanism by which lipids that have been deposited within implanted vascular grafts may become oxidized. Oxidized lipids may contribute to the cellular dysfunction that results in anastomotic intimal hyperplasia and graft failure.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of identifying alterations in blood supply to the spinal cord during thoracic aortic crossclamping.\nIn 17 pigs, a multiparameter PO(2), PCO(2,) and pH sensor was introduced into the intrathecal space for continuous monitoring of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oxygenation during aortic crossclamping. An epidural laser Doppler probe was used to measure spinal cord flux. After insertion of an aortic shunt from the left subclavian to the left iliac artery and interruption of the right subclavian and lumbar arteries (L2-L5), the thoracic aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery was clamped for 60 minutes. By placement of the distal aortic crossclamping below the level of L1 in group A (n = 9 animals), perfusion of only the abdominal visceral arteries was maintained. In group B (n = 8 animals), the distal aortic crossclamping was above the level of T12, and thus some spinal cord perfusion was maintained through the aortic shunt.\nThe significant decrease in CSF PO(2) was observed within 3 minutes after the placement of the proximal aortic crossclamping and was normalized in all animals after establishment of the shunt flow. In group A, distal aortic crossclamping caused a decrease in CSF PO(2) with at least 50% of the preclamping values within 3 minutes. The mean CSF PO(2) of 2.99 +/- 0.70 kPa at 60 minutes of distal aortic crossclamping in group B was significantly higher than in group A (0.11 +/- 0.11 kPa; P <. 001). In group A, PCO(2) measurements showed no significant changes in 3 minutes after distal aortic crossclamping but revealed significantly higher values at 30 and 60 minutes compared with group B. Spinal cord flux values showed similar changes as CSF PO(2) during the whole experiment in both groups.\nIn this experimental model of aortic crossclamping, continuous CSF oxygen tension monitoring allows rapid detection of alterations in spinal cord circulation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the postoperative dilation of two types of knitted polyester arterial prostheses with the use of helical computed tomographic scanning.\nThirty-four patients who underwent aortoiliac or aortofemoral bifurcation grafting were randomized to receive a collagen-sealed warp-knitted polyester graft (n = 16 patients) or a gelatin-sealed K\u00f6per-knitted polyester graft (n = 18 patients). Alterations in size of all parts of the grafts were evaluated by helical computed tomographic scanning at postoperative day 8, at 3 months, and at 6 months.\nOn postoperative day 8, the mean dilation of the K\u00f6per-knitted grafts was 18% +/- 8% for the stem and 15% +/- 12% for the limbs. At the same time period, the mean dilation of warp-knitted grafts was 27% +/- 13% for the stem and 33% +/- 18% for the limbs. No increase in graft dilation was observed at 3 and 6 months. Despite the wide range of values among patients with the same graft type, at each time interval, the K\u00f6per-knitted grafts dilated significantly less than the warp-knitted grafts (P <. 05).\nIn this randomized study, helical computed tomographic scanning was an accurate technique with which to assess graft dilation. For a 6-month follow-up interval, the K\u00f6per-knitted polyester structure dilated less than the warp-knitted structure. Longer-term serial scans should allow a better understanding of the clinical significance of graft dilation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report an initial experience with the endovascular repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Complications and intermediate-term morphologic changes were identified with the intent of altering patient selection and device design.\nEndografts were placed into 25 patients at high-risk for conventional surgical repair over a 3(1/2)-year period. Devices were customized on the basis of preoperative imaging information. Follow-up computed tomography scans were obtained at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Additional interventions occurred in the setting of endoleaks, migration, and aneurysm growth.\nThe overall 30-day mortality rate was 20% (12.5% for elective cases; 33% for emergent cases). There were 3 conversions to open repair. Neurologic deficits developed in 3 patients; 1 insult resulted in permanent paraplegia. Neurologic deficits were associated with longer endografts (P =.019). Three endoleaks required treatment, and 1 fatal rupture of the thoracic aneurysm treated occurred 6 months after the initial repair. Migrations were detected in 4 patients. The maximal aneurysm size decreased yearly by 9.15% (P =.01) or by 13.5% (P =.0005) if patients with endoleaks (n = 3 patients) were excluded. Both the proximal and distal neck dilated slightly over the course of follow-up (P =.019 and P =.001, respectively). The length of the proximal neck was a significant predictor of the risk for endoleakage (P =.02).\nThe treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms with an endovascular approach is feasible and may, in some patients, offer the best means of therapy. Early complications were primarily related to device design and patient selection. All aneurysms without endoleaks decreased in size after treatment. Late complications were associated with changing aneurysm morphologic features and device migration. The morphologic changes remain somewhat unpredictable; however, alterations in device design may result in improved fixation and more durable aneurysm exclusion.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was the identification of risk factors for adverse events and the assessment of the early success rate in 1554 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) who underwent treatment with endovascular technique between January 1994 and March 1999. For this purpose, the clinical and procedural data were correlated with observed complications and endoleaks.\nThe data were collected from 56 European centers and submitted to a central registry. Patient characteristics, aortoiliac anatomic features, operative technical details, types of devices used, and experience of the teams of physicians were correlated with the occurrence of complications and endoleaks. The technical success rate was assessed according to the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, North American Chapter, guidelines. For the assessment of correlations between risk factors and adverse events, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used.\nThe operative complications were grouped into three categories: failure to complete the procedure (39 patients, of which 27 underwent a conversion to an open AAA repair; 2.5%); device-related or procedure-related complications (149 patients; 10%); and arterial complications (51 patients; 3%). The most important risk factors for failure to complete the procedure included an aneurysm diameter of 60 mm or more and the need for adjuvant procedures. The factors that predicted device-related and arterial complications were the experience of the team with endovascular AAA treatment and the need for adjuvant procedures. Forty patients (2.6%) died within 30 days after operation. American Society of Anesthesiologists III and IV operative risk classification results predicted higher mortality rates than did American Society of Anesthesiologists operative risk classification I and II results. The patients who underwent operation in 1994, the first year documented in this registry, and those who required adjuvant procedures also had an increased risk of perioperative death. The incidence rate of systemic complications within the first 30 days (279 patients; 18%) was higher in patients aged 75 years or more, in patients with an impaired cardiac status, and in patients considered unfit for an open procedure. An endoleak was detected at the completion of the procedure in 16% of the cases and was still present after 1 month in 9%. The risk factors for primary endoleaks were female gender and age of 75 years and older. The observed technical success rate in this patient series was 72%.\nThe learning curve of the doctors and the need for adjuvant procedures were independent risk factors of operative device-related and arterial complications. The importance of proper instruction during an institution's initial phase with this treatment is emphasized by these observations. Although the endovascular management of AAAs is less stressful than open surgery, systemic complications were still the most common adverse events during the first postoperative month. These complications were associated with several patient-related factors, including advanced age, impaired cardiac status, and poor general medical condition. These observations may be a guide for improved patient selection for endovascular AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of endovascular aneurysm repair in high-risk patients.\nThe elective endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysm was performed in 116 high-risk patients with either custom-made or commercial stent grafts. The routine follow-up examination included contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) before discharge, at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. Patients with endoleak on the initial CT underwent re-evaluation at 2 weeks. Those patients with positive CT results at 2 weeks underwent endovascular treatment.\nEndovascular repair was considered feasible in 67% of the patients. The mean age was 75 years, and the mean aneurysm diameter was 6.3 cm. The American Society of Anesthesiologists grade was II in 3.4%, III in 65.5%, IV in 30.1%, and V in 0.9%. There were no conversions to open repair. Custom-made aortomonoiliac stent grafts were implanted in 77.6% of the cases, custom-made aortoaotic stent grafts in 11.2%, and commercial bifurcated stent grafts in 11.2%. The 30-day rates of mortality, major morbidity, and minor morbidity were 3.4%, 20.7%, and 12%, respectively, in the first 58 patients and 0%, 3.4%, and 3.4%, respectively, in the last 58. The late complications included five cases of stent graft kinking, two cases of femorofemoral graft occlusion, and three cases of proximal stent migration, one of which led to aneurysm rupture. At 2 weeks after repair, endoleak was present in 10.3% of the cases. All the type I (direct perigraft) endoleaks underwent successful endovascular treatment, whereas only one type II (collateral) endoleak responded to treatment. The technical success rate at 2 weeks was 86.2%, and the clinical success rate was 96.6%. The continuing success rate was 87.9%. Seventeen patients died late, unrelated deaths.\nEndovascular aneurysm repair is safe and effective in patients at high risk, for whom it may be the preferred method of treatment.",

The patients were veterans, 187 men and two women, in whom the diagnosis of an IAA was made, as defined by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards of The Society for Vascular Surgery and International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, North American Chapter (IAA >/= 1.5 cm). Expansion rates relative to the size of IAAs and clinical outcomes were noted for all patients.\nOne hundred eighty-nine patients (mean age, 72.3 +/- 0.5 years) with 323 IAAs (mean size, 2.34 +/- 0.7 cm) were found. The mean follow-up (96% of patients with B mode ultrasound scanning) period was 31.4 months, with each patient undergoing a mean of 4.2 studies. The 4-year life-table survival rate was 78.2%, with no patient deaths related to their IAAs. Symptoms were noted in six of 189 patients (3.1%; two ruptures, four chronic pain), who all had IAAs larger than 4 cm. IAAs were repaired in 34 of 189 patients (18%), in 25 of the 34 patients because of their associated abdominal aortic aneurysms and in nine of 34 patients because of their IAAs alone. All nine patients requiring operative treatment of indications related to the IAA had an IAA larger than 4 cm. Expansion rates were slow for IAAs smaller than 3 cm (0.11 +/- 0.02 cm/year) and significantly greater (P <.003) for IAAs 3 to 5 cm (0.26 +/- 0.1 cm/year). The correlation between B mode ultrasound scanning and computed tomography scanning was excellent. The size of the IAAs was underestimated by 0.03 +/- 0. 06 cm by means of B mode ultrasound scanning.\nThe IAAs followed up by this contemporary Veterans Affairs vascular surgery service were small, rarely caused symptoms or rupture, and expanded at a slow rate. IAAs smaller than 3 cm could be followed up safely on an annual basis with B mode ultrasound scanning. IAAs that are 3 cm or larger and smaller than 3.5 cm should be carefully followed with B mode ultrasound scanning at 6-month intervals, whereas elective repair should be considered for IAAs 3.5 cm or larger in good-risk patients. Based on this report and currently available evidence and recommendations, asymptomatic IAAs that are 4 cm or larger and all other symptomatic IAAs should be considered for operative repair. Also, the reported high rupture rate of IAAs that are 5 cm or larger mandates prompt operative repair.",

Also, the reported high rupture rate of IAAs that are 5 cm or larger mandates prompt operative repair.",

IAAs were repaired in 34 of 189 patients (18%), in 25 of the 34 patients because of their associated abdominal aortic aneurysms and in nine of 34 patients because of their IAAs alone. All nine patients requiring operative treatment of indications related to the IAA had an IAA larger than 4 cm. Expansion rates were slow for IAAs smaller than 3 cm (0.11 +/- 0.02 cm/year) and significantly greater (P <.003) for IAAs 3 to 5 cm (0.26 +/- 0.1 cm/year). The correlation between B mode ultrasound scanning and computed tomography scanning was excellent. The size of the IAAs was underestimated by 0.03 +/- 0. 06 cm by means of B mode ultrasound scanning.",

    "abstract": "Finger ischemia caused by embolic occlusion of digital arteries originating from the palmar ulnar artery in a person repetitively striking objects with the heel of the hand has been termed hypothenar hammer syndrome (HHS). Previous reports have attributed the arterial pathology to traumatic injury to normal vessels. A large experience leads us to hypothesize that HHS results from trauma to intrinsically abnormal arteries.\nWe reviewed the arteriography, histology, and clinical outcome of all patients treated for HHS in a university clinical research center study of hand ischemia, which prospectively enrolled more than 1300 subjects from 1971 to 1998.\nTwenty-one men had HHS. All had occupational (mechanic, carpenter, etc) or avocational (woodworker) exposure to repetitive palmar trauma. All patients underwent upper-extremity and hand arteriography, unilateral in eight patients (38%) and bilateral in 13 patients (62%). By means of arteriogram, multiple digital artery occlusions were shown in the symptomatic hand, with either segmental ulnar artery occlusion in the palm or characteristic \"corkscrew\" elongation, with alternating stenoses and ectasia. Similar changes in the contralateral asymptomatic (and less traumatized) hand were shown by means of 12 of 13 bilateral arteriograms (92%). Twenty-one operations, consisting of segmental ulnar artery excision in the palm and vein grafting, were performed on 19 patients. Histology was compatible with fibromuscular dysplasia with superimposed trauma. Patency of arterial repairs at 2 years was 84%. One patient (5%) required amputative debridement of necrotic finger tips. No other tissue loss occurred. There have been no recurrences of ischemia in patients with patent bypass grafts.\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest reported group of HHS patients. The characteristic angiographic appearance, histologic findings, and striking incidence of bilateral abnormalities in patients with unilateral symptoms lead us to conclude that HHS occurs when persons with preexisting palmar ulnar artery fibrodysplasia experience repetitive palmar trauma. This revised theory for the etiology of HHS explains why HHS does not develop in most patients with repetitive palmar trauma.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the prospective comparison of functional outcomes after lower extremity bypass grafting surgery, angioplasty, or medical management of intermittent claudication.\nThe study was designed as a prospective cohort study to compare functional outcomes for patients with interventional management to medical management, including a matched (younger, with more disability) subgroup, followed for a mean of 19 months. Sixteen Chicago-area vascular surgery clinics participated in the study. The subjects were consecutively enrolled patients with an abnormal ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), without signs of rest pain, ulcer, or gangrene, and without prior lower extremity revascularization procedures. The main outcome measures were changes in physical functioning, community walking distance, bodily pain, leg symptoms, and ABI.\nOf the 526 study patients, 20% underwent revascularization procedures (60 surgical bypass grafting and 44 angioplasty only). The mean ABI improved significantly for the patients who underwent bypass grafting surgery (0.20; P <.001) and modestly for the patients who underwent angioplasty (0.09; P <. 05). Patients undergoing bypass grafting and angioplasty maintained highly significant (P <.001) improvements in mean physical functioning, (17%, 14%), bodily pain (18%, 13%), and walking distance (28%, 27%) scores and reported greater leg symptom improvement. The results were far superior for the patients with greater improvement in ABI. The conditions of the 277 unmatched patients who underwent medical management declined on all outcome measures, and the conditions of the 145 matched patients who underwent medical management improved 5% (P <.001) on walking distance score. Eighteen percent of the study patients failed to complete the full study follow-up period.\nMost of the functional improvement achieved by patients who underwent interventional management appears to be related to improved patency rather than to selection bias or placebo effects. The functional gains were approximately half those often reported for patients for hip arthroplasty and similar to patients who undergo elective coronary angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Recommendations recently published by the National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcome and Quality Initiative (DOQI) included an appeal for increased use of native arteriovenous fistulas (NAVFs) to improve overall patency and contain angioaccess costs. We evaluated the impact of the DOQI recommendations on angioaccess surgery and its outcome at our institution.\nFrom June 1996 to April 1999, 483 angioaccess procedures were performed on 247 patients. There were 133 men and 114 women, with an average age ranging from 28 to 95 years (mean age, 69 +/- 0.59 years). Risk factors included smoking in 143 patients (58%), diabetes mellitus in 135 patients (55%), hypertension in 150 patients (61%), and coronary artery disease in 98 patients (40%). The patients were divided in two groups. Group I (pre-DOQI) included patients who had angioaccess procedures between June 1996 and November 1997, and group II (post-DOQI) included patients who had angioaccess procedures between December 1997 and April 1999. The types of procedures performed included placement of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) in 122 patients (25%), creation of NAVFs in 99 patients (20%), revision of AVGs in 123 patients (25%), and temporary access procedures in 135 patients (28%). Forty-seven of the NAVF procedures were radial-cephalic fistulas (47%), 22 were brachial-cephalic fistulas (23%), and 30 were brachial-basilic fistulas (30%). Patients underwent serial ultrasonography scanning and physical examinations; the mean follow-up period was 9 months. Choice of angioaccess procedures and patency rates before and after implementation of the DOQI recommendations were compared.\nThere was a significant increase in the use of NAVFs after implementing DOQI recommendations (5% vs 68%, P <.001). The 1-year primary patency rate of AVGs was less than that of arteriovenous fistulas (54% vs 85%, P <.001). During the study period, the percentage of AVGs placed at our institution that required revision (59%; 72 of 123) was higher than that of NAVFs that required revision (4%; 4 of 99; P <.001). There was no significant difference in the maturation rates of radial-cephalic fistulas (75%), brachial-cephalic fistulas (91%), and brachial-basilic fistulas (87%).\nBy adopting the DOQI recommendations, we used NAVFs more often. This resulted in superior patency rates, compared with synthetic grafts. The liberal use of preoperative duplex venous mapping further increased NAVF use, surpassing the DOQI expectations for primary arteriovenous fistulas. Additionally, fewer revisions were required.",

    "abstract": "The modification of the distal anastomosis of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bypass grafts with vein interposition cuffs (VCs) has been reported to increase graft patency. However, the mechanisms that are responsible for this improved patency are unclear. Because intimal hyperplasia (IH) is a primary cause of prosthetic graft failure, we hypothesized that VCs affect the distal anastomosis by decreasing the IH response of the outflow artery.\nTwenty-three female domestic Yorkshire pigs (mean weight, 35 kg) underwent 42 femoral PTFE bypass grafting procedures. The PTFE bypass grafts were separated into the following three groups according to distal anastomotic configuration: end-to-side anastomoses (ES), VCs, and cuffs constructed with PTFE (PCs). Four femoral arteries from two pigs served as healthy controls. At sacrifice, the grafts were perfusion fixed, and the distal anastomoses harvested at 1 and 4 weeks. The specimens were hemisected and serially sectioned to identify the heel, toe, and mid-anastomotic regions. The sections were cut into 5-microm segments and analyzed for intima and media thickness and area, intima/media area ratio, and the distribution of IH in the vein cuff. The roles of transforming growth factor-beta1 and platelet-derived growth factor-BB in IH development were assessed with immunohistochemistry.\nIH development was significantly lower at all areas of the anastomosis, with VCs compared with ES and PCs at 4 weeks (P </=.001). IH decreased in VCs from 1 to 4 weeks in all areas of the anastomosis (P </=.001). PCs showed pronounced IH at the mid-anastomosis as compared with VCs and ES (P </=.001). IH was most pronounced at the toe with ES and PCs (P </=.001). Qualitatively, VCs altered the site of IH development, sparing the recipient artery with preferential thickening of the vein cuff and formation of a pseudointima at the vein-PTFE interface. Immunohistochemistry results showed positive staining for transforming growth factor-beta1, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and smooth muscle alpha-actin in the hyperplastic intima.\nPTFE bypass grafts with VCs had less IH develop than did grafts with ES and PC anastomoses. IH regression in VCs at 4 weeks suggests compensatory vessel wall remodeling mediated by the presence of the VC. Furthermore, VCs caused a redistribution of hyperplasia to the vein-PTFE interface, delaying IH-induced outflow obstruction in the recipient artery. The marked increase in IH with PCs, despite a similar geometric configuration to VCs, suggests that the biologic properties of autogenous tissue dissipate IH development. Similarly, the flow patterns in PCs and VCs should be identical, which suggests a less important role of hemodynamic forces in VC-mediated protection.",

    "abstract": "In this retrospective multicenter study, the results of a minimally invasive method of endovascular-assisted in situ bypass grafting (EISB) versus \"open\" conventional in situ bypass grafting (CISB) were evaluated with a comparison of primary and secondary patency, limb salvage, and cost.\nEnrolled in this study were 273 patients: 117 underwent CISB (42 femoropopliteal, 75 femorocrural) and 156 underwent EISB (41 femoropopliteal, 115 femorocrural). EISB was performed with an angioscopic Side Branch Occlusion system and an angioscopically guided valvulotome. All the patients underwent follow-up examination with serial color-flow ultrasound scanning.\nBoth groups had similar comorbid risk factors for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery heart disease, hypertension, and cigarette smoking. The primary patency rates (CISB, 78.2% +/- 5% [SE]; EISB, 70.5% +/- 5%; P =.156), the secondary patency rates (CISB, 84.1% +/- 4%; EISB, 82.9% +/- 5%; P =.26), and the limb salvage rates (CISB, 85.8%; EISB, 88.4%; P =.127) were statistically similar, with a follow-up period that extended to 39 months (mean, 16.6 months; range, 1 to 40 months). In veins that were less than 2.5 to 3.0 mm in diameter, the EISB grafts fared poorly, with an increased incidence of early (12-month) graft thromboses (CISB, 10 grafts, 8.5%; EISB, 24 grafts, 15.3%). However, wound complications (CISB, 23%; EISB, 4%; P =.003), mean hospital length of stay (CISB, 6.5 days +/- 4.83; EISB, 3.2 days +/- 3.19; P =.001), and mean hospital charges (CISB, $25,349 +/- $19,476; EISB, $18,096 +/- $14,573; P =.001) were all significantly reduced in the EISB group.\nThe CISB and EISB midterm primary and secondary patency and limb salvage rates were statistically similar.

    "abstract": "The absence of an adequate ipsilateral saphenous vein in patients requiring lower-extremity revascularization poses a difficult clinical dilemma. This study examined the results of the use of autogenous arm vein bypass grafts in these patients.\nFive hundred twenty lower-extremity revascularization procedures performed between 1990 and 1998 were followed prospectively with a computerized vascular registry. The arm vein conduit was prepared by using intraoperative angioscopy for valve lysis and identification of luminal abnormalities in 44.8% of cases.\nSeventy-two (13. 8%) femoropopliteal, 174 (33.5%) femorotibial, 29 (5.6%) femoropedal, 101 (19.4%) popliteo-tibial/pedal, and 144 (27.7%) extension \"jump\" graft bypass procedures were performed for limb salvage (98.2%) or disabling claudication (1.8%). The average age of patients was 68.5 years (range, 32 to 91 years); 63.1% of patients were men, and 36.9% of patients were women. Eighty-five percent of patients had diabetes mellitus, and 77% of patients had a recent history of smoking. The grafts were composed of a single arm vein segment in 363 cases (69. 8%) and of spliced composite vein with venovenostomy in 157 cases (30.2%). The mean follow-up period was 24.9 months (range, 1 month to 7.4 years). Overall patency and limb salvage rates for all graft types were: primary patency, 30-day = 97.0% +/- 0.7%, 1-year = 80.2% +/- 2.1%, 3-year = 68.9% +/- 3.6%, 5-year = 54.5% +/- 6.6%; secondary patency, 30-day = 97.0% +/- 0.7%, 1-year = 80.7% +/- 2.1%, 3-year = 70.3% +/- 3.4%, 5-year = 57.5% +/- 6.2%; limb salvage, 30-day = 97.6% +/- 0.7%, 1-year = 89.8% +/- 1.7%, 3-year = 82.1% +/- 3.3%, 5-year = 71.5% +/- 6.9%. Secondary patency and limb salvage rates were greatest at 5 years for femoropopliteal grafts (69.8% +/- 12.8%, 80.7% +/- 11.8%), as compared with femorotibial (59.6% +/- 10. 3%, 72.7% +/- 10.5%), femoropedal (54.9% +/- 25.7%, 56.8% +/- 26.9%, ) and popliteo-tibial/pedal grafts (39.0% +/- 7.3%, 47.6% +/- 15.4%). The patency rate of composite vein grafts was equal to that of single-vein conduits. The overall survival rate was 54% at 4 years.\nAutogenous arm vein has been used successfully in a wide variety of lower-extremity revascularization procedures and has achieved excellent long- and short-term patency and limb salvage rates, higher than those generally reported for prosthetic or cryopreserved grafts. Its durability and easy accessibility make it an alternative conduit of choice when an adequate saphenous vein is not available.",

    "abstract": "In patients with carotid bifurcation disease, the risk of stroke mainly depends on the severity of the stenosis, the presenting hemispheric symptom, and, as recently suggested, on plaque echodensity. We tested the hypothesis that asymptomatic carotid plaques and plaques of patients who present with different hemispheric symptoms are related to different plaque structure in terms of echodensity and the degree of stenosis.\nTwo hundred sixty-four patients with 295 carotid bifurcation plaques (146 symptomatic, 149 asymptomatic) causing more than 50% stenosis were examined with duplex scanning. Thirty-six plaques were associated with amaurosis fugax (AF), 68 plaques were associated with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and 42 plaques were associated with stroke. B-mode images were digitized and normalized using linear scaling and two reference points, blood and adventitia. The gray scale median (GSM) of blood was set to 0, and the GSM of the adventitia was set to 190 (gray scale range, black = 0; white = 255). The GSM of the plaque in the normalized image was used as the objective measurement of echodensity.\nThe mean GSM and the mean degree of stenosis, with 95% confidence intervals, for plaques associated with hemispheric symptoms were 13.3 (10.6 to 16) and 80.5 (78.3 to 82.7), respectively; and for asymptomatic plaques, the mean GSM and the mean degree of stenosis were 30.5 (26.2 to 34.7) and 72. 2 (69.8 to 74.5), respectively. Furthermore, in plaques related to AF, the mean GSM and the mean degree of stenosis were 7.4 (1.9 to 12. 9) and 85.6 (82 to 89.2), respectively; in those related to TIA, the mean GSM and the mean degree of stenosis were 14.9 (11.2 to 18.6) and 79.3 (76.1 to 82.4), respectively; and in those related to stroke, the mean GSM and the mean degree of stenosis were 15.8 (10.2 to 21.3) and 78.1 (73.4 to 82.8), respectively.\nPlaques associated with hemispheric symptoms are more hypoechoic and more stenotic than those associated with no symptoms. Plaques associated with AF are more hypoechoic and more stenotic than those associated with TIA or stroke or those without symptoms. Plaques causing TIA and stroke have the same echodensity and the same degree of stenosis. These findings confirm previous suggestions that hypoechoic plaques are more likely to be symptomatic than hyperechoic ones. They support the hypothesis that the pathophysiologic mechanism for AF is different from that for TIA and stroke.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the etiologic factors in the progression of carotid stenosis.\nWe performed prospective serial duplex scan surveillance of 1470 carotid arteries in 905 asymptomatic patients during a 10-year period, with an average follow-up interval of 29 months and an average of 3.0 scans per carotid artery. Vascular laboratory and hospital records were used to collect risk factor information. The data were analyzed with proportional hazards modeling.\nWe examined several demographic, clinical, and laboratory risk factors that were chosen because of their potential relevance to atherosclerotic disease. These factors were analyzed with univariate proportional hazards modeling, in which time to progression of stenosis was the outcome variable. The six significant predictors (P <.05) were age, sex, systolic pressure, pulse pressure (systolic pressure - diastolic pressure), total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). All, except HDL, were positive predictors of time to disease progression. With multivariate modeling, only pulse pressure and HDL remained as significant independent predictors of stenosis progression. The risk ratio for a 10-mm Hg rise in pulse pressure was 1.12, and the risk ratio for a 10-mg/dL decrease in HDL was 1.20.\nIn this large cohort of patients who were followed prospectively for carotid stenosis, pulse pressure and HDL were found to be the key risk factors for carotid stenosis progression. The fact that pulse pressure superseded systolic pressure in multivariate modeling may shed light on the biology of carotid plaque progression. Further, our identification of these modifiable risk factors may help in the design of therapeutic trials for the prevention of progression of carotid atherosclerosis.",

The six significant predictors (P <.05) were age, sex, systolic pressure, pulse pressure (systolic pressure - diastolic pressure), total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). All, except HDL, were positive predictors of time to disease progression. With multivariate modeling, only pulse pressure and HDL remained as significant independent predictors of stenosis progression. The risk ratio for a 10-mm Hg rise in pulse pressure was 1.12, and the risk ratio for a 10-mg/dL decrease in HDL was 1.20.",

    "abstract": "The durability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) may be affected by carotid restenosis. The data from randomized trials show that the highest incidence of restenosis after CEA occurs from 12 to 18 months after surgery. The optimal CEA technique to reduce perioperative complications and restenosis rates is still undefined. This study examines the long-term clinical outcome and incidence of recurrent stenosis in patients who undergo eversion CEA. Previously published perioperative results of this study did not show statistically significant differences in study endpoints between the eversion and standard techniques.\nFrom October 1994 to March 1997, 1353 patients with surgical indications for carotid stenosis were randomly assigned to undergo eversion (n = 678) or standard CEA (n = 675; primary closure, 419; patch, 256). Withdrawal from the assigned treatment occurred in 1.6% of the patients (in 13 assigned to eversion CEA, and in nine assigned to standard CEA). The clinical and duplex scan follow-up examination was 99% complete, and the mean follow-up interval was 33 months (range, 12 to 55 months). The primary outcomes were perioperative and late major stroke and death, carotid restenosis (stenosis >/= 50% of the lumen diameter detected at duplex scanning), and carotid occlusion. The primary evaluation of study outcomes was conducted on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis.\nRestenosis was found at duplex scanning in 56 patients (19 in the eversion group, and 37 in the standard group). Within the standard group, the restenosis rates were 7.9% in the primary closure population and 1.5% in the patched population. Of the patients with restenosis, 36% underwent cerebral angiography that confirmed restenosis in all cases. The cumulative restenosis risk at 4 years was significantly lower in the group that underwent treatment with eversion CEA as compared with the standard group (3.6% vs 9.2%; P =.01), with an absolute risk reduction of 5. 6% and a relative risk reduction of 62%. Eighteen patients would have had to undergo treatment with eversion CEA to prevent one restenosis during the 4-year period. The incidence rate of ipsilateral stroke was 3.3% in the eversion population and 2.2% in the standard group. There were no significant differences in the cumulative risks of ipsilateral stroke (3.9% for eversion, and 2.2% for standard; P =.2) and death (13.1% for eversion, and 12.7% for standard; P =.7)) in the two groups. Of the 18 variables that were examined for their influence on restenosis, eversion CEA (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.6; P =.0004) and patch CEA (hazard ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.6; P =. 002) were negative independent predictors of restenosis with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.\nThe EVEREST (EVERsion carotid Endarterectomy versus Standard Trial) showed that eversion CEA is safe, effective, and durable. No statistically significant differences were found in late outcome between the eversion and standard techniques at the available follow-up examination.",

The cause of the lesion was atherosclerosis (n = 300), extrinsic compression (n = 42), dissection (n = 7), radiation arteritis (n = 5), intimal hyperplasia (n = 3), fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 2), previous surgical ligation (n = 3), aneurysm (n = 2), and other (n = 5). All the patients underwent preoperative arteriography. There were 252 proximal ECVA reconstructions (218 transpositions, 42 bypass grafting procedures, and two other) and 117 distal ECVA reconstructions (85 bypass grafting procedures, 25 transpositions, and seven other). In 83 patients, the ECVA operation was performed concomitant with a carotid or supraaortic trunk reconstruction. This series was analyzed in two separate sets: before 1991 (n = 215), when changes in indications and management were occurring; and after 1991 (n = 154), when we acquired a dedicated anesthesia team and digital arteriography in the operating room and established uniform protocols for the management of ECVA disease. The stroke, death, and stroke/death rates for the period before 1991 were, respectively, 4. 1%, 3.2% and 5.1%. The stroke, death, and stroke/death rates for the period after 1991 were, respectively, 1.9%, 0.6% and 1.9%. The patency rate at 5 years was 80%. The survival rate at 5 years was 70%. Most of the deaths during the follow-up period were caused by cardiac disease. Among the survivors, the protection rate from stroke was 97%.\nThe changes in operative selection and management have improved the results of ECVA reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Thrombosis may be the most common cause of death in the United States. Virchow postulated, approximately 150 years ago, that intravascular thrombosis was caused by changes of the vessel wall, by reduction in blood flow, and by alteration of the chemical composition of the blood. The hypercoagulability component of the Virchow triad has, until recently, been poorly defined. During the past 40 years, a number of acquired and congenital hypercoagulable disorders have been described so that currently the cause for thrombotic events can be determined in many patients. The hypercoagulable-related thromboses are usually venous but may, less often, be arterial, and the thromboses often are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The vascular surgeon often participates in the management of hypercoagulable disorders. This review of hypercoagulable disorders is presented with the hope that the early recognition of these disorders will lead to the appropriate diagnosis and proper management of hypercoagulable-related thromboses.",

S130K is a mutation of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), with lysine replacing serine in the heparin-binding site. We measured molecular stability and mitogenic activity of FGF-1 and S130K, both in the media and when suspended in fibrin glue (FG), on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) to determine if the mutation altered the function and potential clinical applicability.\nEC and SMC proliferation of soluble FGF-1 or S130K at 0, 0. 1, 1, 10, or 100 ng/mL with heparin at 0, 5, 50, or 500 units (U)/mL was measured on growth-arrested cells in serum-free media. EC and SMC proliferation assays with cells on FG containing either FGF-1 or S130K at 0, 1, 10, 100, or 1000 ng/mL in combination with heparin at 0, 5, 50 or 500 U/mL were also performed during the exponential growth phase. Molecular degradation by thrombin was measured by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nS130K induces greater EC and SMC proliferation in the absence of heparin than FGF-1 does (P <.0001 for both the 10 and 100 ng/mL doses). S130K is also significantly more potent than FGF-1 in the presence of heparin. Heparin in the media enhances cytokine-induced SMC and EC proliferation at doses of 5 U/mL, but inhibits SMC proliferation at concentrations of 500 U/mL. For the FG data, unlike FGF-1, S130K induces EC and SMC proliferation in the absence of heparin. The addition of 5 U/mL of heparin enhances the proliferation induced by S130K. For ECs, as the heparin dose increases to 50 U/mL, proliferation decreases, as compared with the 5 U/mL concentration when either FGF-1 or S130K in the FG was compared at concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 ng/mL (P <.01). S130K is more potent in FG than is FGF-1 both with and without heparin and exhibits maximal EC and SMC proliferation at 10 ng/mL, whereas FGF-1 activity is maximal at 100 ng/mL. Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that S130K was relatively more resistant to thrombin degradation than FGF-1.\nSite-directed mutagenesis changed the potency and the heparin dependency on cellular proliferation of FGF-1 in vitro. These techniques should allow the delivery of mutant growth factors to areas of vascular intervention to induce specific, desired responses. We believe that these studies will enhance our knowledge of the function of various regions of the FGF-1 molecule, allowing us to more precisely design increasingly more useful FGF-1 mutants.",

    "abstract": "Growth factors and cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) stimulate smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production by binding and activating their respective receptors. Recent investigations suggest that simultaneous activation of integrins, which are heterodimeric receptors for ECM, may also be required for growth factor and cytokine function. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of two integrins, alpha v beta 3 and alpha 2 beta 1, both previously identified in vascular SMCs, is necessary for growth factor- and cytokine-induced vascular SMC dysfunction.\nDNA synthesis was measured after stimulation of SMCs derived from human saphenous vein with the growth factors PDGF-BB, EGF, and bFGF. SMC fibronectin (Fn) production was measured (by means of Western blotting) in SMCs stimulated for 72 hours with TGF-beta1 or EGF. Both endpoints were measured in the presence and absence of antibodies that block the function of the alpha v beta 3 and alpha 2 beta 1 integrins as well as the alpha2 and beta1 subunits.\nThe alpha v beta 3 integrin blocking antibody significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-, EGF-, and bFGF-induced SMC proliferation. The alpha v beta 3 integrin antibody also markedly inhibited TGF-1- and EGF-induced SMC Fn production. Neither the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin nor the alpha2 or the beta1 subunits inhibited either proliferation or matrix protein production in response to any of these agonists.\nThe alpha v beta 3 integrin is required for growth factor- and cytokine-induced SMC proliferation and FN production, whereas alpha 2 beta 1 is not. Since activation of alpha v beta 3 is required for the activity of at least four distinct growth factors and cytokines, inhibition of this integrin might be used as a therapeutic tool for the prevention of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "We have shown that gene transfer of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene to injured arteries inhibits the development of intimal hyperplasia. One mechanism by which nitric oxide (NO) may inhibit this process is through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which induces a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, leading to an inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. Because NO induced such a dramatic upregulation of p21 and because p21 is a universal inhibitor of the cell cycle, this study aimed to determine how NO upregulates p21 protein expression in VSMCs.\np21 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were determined by Northern blot analysis after treatment with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) or after adenoviral iNOS gene transfer. p21 protein levels in RASMCs in similar conditions were determined by Western blot analysis. Levels of ubiquinated p21 in these same treatment groups were assessed by immunoprecipitation of p21 from RASMCs, followed by western blot analysis for ubiquitin. Protein tyrosine and protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity after treatment with SNAP, plus or minus the phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A or cantharidin, were measured with (32)P-labeled myelin basic protein as a substrate.\nNO exposure by the NO-donor SNAP or iNOS gene transfer induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in p21 protein expression in RASMCs. p21 mRNA levels were significantly increased after SNAP treatment only at the 6-hour point, but were not increased at 24 hours. In contrast, protein levels were increased from 6 to 24 hours, and transcriptional inhibitors did not inhibit this increase in protein synthesis. The increase in p21 protein expression induced by NO was associated with less of the ubiquinated form of p21 at both early and late points. Furthermore, NO induced an increase in both protein tyrosine and protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity. Inhibition of these phosphatases with calyculin A or cantharidin prevented the upregulation of p21 protein expression by NO.\nThese data indicate that one mechanism by which NO upregulates p21 protein expression is through the prevention of p21 protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in association with increased protein tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatase activity.",

In this study, we locally administrated standard heparin therapy and evaluated its effects on neointimal hyperplasia formation in a baboon model of aortoiliac bypass graft placement.\nSix adult male baboons underwent bilateral aortoiliac bypass grafting with ringed ePTFE (4 mm internal diameter x 5 cm length). In each animal, the distal anastomosis of one graft was continuously infused with heparin (50 U/h) and the distal anastomosis of the contralateral graft was infused with saline solution at the same rate (2.5 microL/h), with osmotic pumps implanted for 4 weeks. Platelet counts and activated partial thromboplastin time measurements were performed weekly. The specimens were harvested at 4 weeks and were subjected to morphometric analysis. Cell proliferation was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine immunostaining.\nAll the harvested grafts were patent except for one control graft. There were no significant differences in platelet counts or activated partial thromboplastin time measurements taken before and during heparin infusion. As expected, there were no significant differences in graft neointimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation at the proximal anastomoses between the heparin-infused and control grafts. In contrast, at the treated distal anastomoses, heparin infusion significantly reduced the graft neointimal area by 65% and the cell proliferation index by 47% as compared with the untreated control distal anastomoses.\nThese results show that local infusion of heparin significantly reduces distal anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation without measurable systemic anticoagulation or other side effects. Thus, this approach may represent an attractive strategy for prolonging ePTFE bypass graft patency.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are considered to play a central role in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Doxycycline (Dox) has direct MMP-inhibiting properties in vitro, and it effectively suppresses the development of elastase-induced AAAs in rodents. The purpose of this study was to determine if treatment with Dox suppresses MMPs within human aneurysm tissue and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect.\nAneurysm tissues were obtained from 15 patients with an AAA, eight of whom had been treated with Dox before surgery (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days). Protein extracts were examined by means of gelatin zymography and immunoblot analysis, and RNA was examined by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effects of Dox on MMP production were further examined in human THP-1 mononuclear phagocytes in vitro.\nNo detectable difference was found between groups by using substrate zymography as a means of assessing total MMP activity, but Dox treatment was associated with a slight (24.4%) reduction in the activated fraction of 72-kDa gelatinase (MMP-2; P <.05). In contrast, a 2.5-fold reduction in the amount of extractable 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) protein in Dox-treated patients was revealed by means of immunoblot analysis (P <.05). Also, a 5.5-fold (81.9%) reduction in MMP-9 messenger RNA (mRNA) in Dox-treated patients was demonstrated by means of quantitative competitive RT-PCR (mean +/- SE, mol MMP-9/mol beta-actin: 1.3 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 3.1; P <.04). There was no significant difference between groups in the relative expression of MMP-2 protein or mRNA. In cultured THP-1 monocytes stimulated with phorbol ester, the expression of MMP-9 protein and mRNA were both decreased after exposure to relevant concentrations of Dox in vitro.\nIn addition to its recognized effects as a direct MMP antagonist, Dox may influence connective tissue degradation within human aneurysm tissue by reducing monocyte/macrophage expression of MMP-9 mRNA and by suppressing the post-translational processing (activation) of proMMP-2. Through this complementary combination of mechanisms, treatment with Dox may be a particularly effective strategy for achieving MMP inhibition in patients with an AAA.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the effectiveness of recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand Ig (rPSGL-Ig) pretreatment to decrease thrombosis and inflammation in experimental venous thrombosis. rPSGL-Ig, a unique mucin-like glycoprotein, has a high affinity for P-selectin.\nTwelve juvenile baboons underwent inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis with temporary 6-hour IVC balloon occlusion. Before balloon placement, the animals received rPSGL-Ig (4 mg/kg; n = 8) or saline solution for control (n = 4). The animals underwent evaluation with duplex ultrasound scan imaging, magnetic resonance venography (MRV), phlebography, coagulation profile, and tissue analysis at death for cytokines and vein wall leukocyte morphometrics. With the MRV results, thrombus development, thrombus resolution, and inflammation (gadolinium; square millimeters of enhancement) were assessed.\nEach animal provided two time points for evaluation (days 2 and 6 after balloon occlusion). A significant decrease in IVC thrombosis between balloons was found in the rPSGL-Ig animals (1 of 16) versus the control animals (5 of 8; P <.01). The MRV results showed significantly less enhancement in the rPSGL-Ig animals at days 2 and 6 (P <.05). Spontaneous thrombus resolution (including balloon sites) was significantly greater from day 2 to day 6 in the rPSGL-Ig animals versus the control animals (23% vs 2%; P <.001), without pulmonary embolism. Lower interleukin-8, platelet factor IV, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels were found in rPSGL-Ig vein walls without significant differences in vein wall leukocyte morphometrics. There were significantly lower D-dimer levels in the rPSGL-Ig-treated animals (P <.05), but there were no differences in measurements of coagulation. Adequate circulating rPSGL-Ig levels were documented.\nPretreatment with rPSGL-Ig results in: (1) a significant inhibition of thrombosis and vein wall inflammation; (2) a decrease in vein wall cytokine expression; and (3) a promotion of thrombus resolution. Inflammatory inhibition by rPSGL-Ig without anticoagulation therapy provides effective venous thrombosis prophylaxis in experimental venous thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Because of allogenic red blood cell (RBC) availability and infection problems, novel alternatives, including hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying solutions (HBOC), are being explored to minimize the perioperative requirement of RBC transfusions. This study evaluated HBOC-201, a room-temperature stable, polymerized, bovine-HBOC, as a substitute for allogenic RBC transfusion in patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic operations.\nIn a single blind, multicenter trial, 72 patients were prospectively randomized two-to-one to HBOC (n = 48) or allogenic RBC (n = 24) at the time of the first transfusion decision, either during or after elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction. Patients randomized to the HBOC group received 60 g of HBOC for the initial transfusion and had the option to receive three more doses (30 g each) within 96 hours. In this group, any further blood requirement was met with allogenic RBCs. Patients randomized to the allogenic RBC group received only standard RBC transfusions. The efficacy analysis was a means of assessing the ability of HBOC to eliminate the requirement for any allogenic RBC transfusions from the time of randomization through 28 days. Safety was evaluated by means of standard clinical trial methods.\nThe two treatment groups were comparable for all baseline characteristics. Although all patients in the allogenic RBC group required at least one allogenic RBC transfusion, 13 of 48 patients (27%; 95% CI, 15% to 42%) in the HBOC group did not require any allogenic RBC transfusions. The only significant changes documented were a 15% increase in mean arterial pressure and a three-fold peak increase in serum urea nitrogen concentration after HBOC. The complications were similar in both groups, with no allergic reactions. There were two perioperative deaths (8%) in the allogenic RBC group and three perioperative deaths (6%) in the HBOC group (P = 1.0).\nHBOC significantly eliminated the need for any allogenic RBC transfusion in 27% of patients undergoing infrarenal aortic reconstruction, but did not reduce the median allogenic RBC requirement. HBOC transfusion was well tolerated and did not influence morbidity or mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported preliminary data on a new procedure that we developed for the treatment of femoral pseudoaneurysms after catheterization. This study presents our current results of percutaneous ultrasound-guided thrombin injection for treating pseudoaneurysms that arise from various locations and causes.\nBetween February 1996 and May 1999, we performed thrombin injection of 83 pseudoaneurysms in 82 patients. There were 74 femoral pseudoaneurysms: 60 from cardiac catheterization (36 interventional), seven from peripheral arteriography (four interventional), five from intra-aortic balloon pumps, and two from dialysis catheters. There were nine other pseudoaneurysms: five brachial (two cardiac catheterization, two gunshot wounds, one after removal of an infected arteriovenous graft), one subclavian (central venous catheter insertion), one radial (arterial line), and one distal superficial femoral and one posterior tibial (both after blunt trauma). Twenty-nine pseudo-aneurysms were injected while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients underwent repeat ultrasound examination within 5 days and after 4 weeks.\nEighty-two of 83 pseudoaneurysms had initial successful treatment by this technique, including 28 of 29 in patients who were undergoing anticoagulation therapy. The only complication was thrombosis of a distal brachial artery, which resolved spontaneously. There were early recurrences in seven patients: four patients underwent successful reinjection; reinjection failed in two patients, who underwent surgical repair; and one patient had spontaneous thrombosis on follow-up. After 4 weeks, ultrasound examinations were completely normal or showed some residual hematoma, and there were no recurrent pseudoaneurysms.\nUltrasound-guided thrombin injection of pseudoaneurysms has excellent results, which support its widespread use as the primary treatment for this common problem.",

Patients with bilateral severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis may be considered for bilateral CEA. High-grade ICA stenosis, however, may artifactually elevate velocity measurements used to quantify stenosis in the contralateral ICA. It is unknown whether ipsilateral CEA will influence duplex determination of the presence of a contralateral 60% to 99% ICA stenosis. This study was performed to determine whether a single preoperative duplex scan is sufficient to plan bilateral CEA.\nPreoperative and early postoperative carotid duplex scans in patients with bilateral ICA stenosis who underwent unilateral CEA were reviewed. Changes in duplex scans that determined stenosis in the ICA contralateral to the CEA were analyzed. Previously validated criteria used to determine 60% to 99% ICA stenosis were a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of 260 cm/sec or more combined with an end diastolic velocity (EDV) of 70 cm/sec or more.\nOver an 8-year period, 460 patients underwent CEA; 107 patients (23.3%) had an asymptomatic 50% to 99% contralateral ICA stenosis by standard criteria (PSV, >125 cm/sec) and an early postoperative duplex scan examination. Of these 107 patients, 38 patients (35.5%) had duplex scan criteria for 60% to 99% contralateral ICA stenosis. In these 38 patients, there was a mean postoperative PSV decrease of 47.7 cm/sec (10.1%) and a mean EDV decrease of 36.0 cm/sec (19.3%) in the ICA contralateral to the CEA. Eight of 38 (21.1%) preoperative contralateral 60% to 99% ICA lesions were reclassified as less than 60% on postoperative duplex scanning. Six of 69 (8.7%) preoperative lesions of less than 60% were reclassified as 60% to 99% on postoperative duplex scan. These six preoperative examinations were all close to the criteria for 60% to 99% stenosis (mean PSV, 232.5 cm/sec; mean EDV, 62.5 cm/sec).\nOne-fifth of patients with apparent 60% to 99% contralateral ICA lesions before the operation have less than 60% stenosis when restudied with duplex scan after unilateral CEA. Lesions below but near the cutoff for 60% to 99% may be reclassified as 60% to 99% on the postoperative duplex scan. These findings mandate that when duplex scanning is used as the sole imaging modality before CEA, patients with severe bilateral carotid stenosis must have an additional carotid duplex examination before operation on the second side.",

The purpose of this review is to update our experience with regard to patient selection, operative technique, and early and late outcome.\nAll patients who had IVC replacement for primary (n = 2) or secondary (n = 27) vena cava tumors from April 1990 to May 1999 were reviewed. Tumor location and type, clinical presentation, the segment of IVC replaced, graft patency, performance status of the patient, and tumor recurrence and survival data were collected. Late follow-up data were available for all but one patient. The IVC was replaced in 28 patients with large diameter (> or =14 mm) externally supported ePTFE grafts and with a panel graft of superficial femoral vein in the other. Three patients had a femoral arteriovenous fistula. Graft patency was determined before hospital dismissal and in follow-up by vena cavography, computed tomography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging.\nThere were 18 women and 11 men, with a mean age of 53.1 years (range, 16-88 years). Over one half of patients had symptoms from their tumor. IVC replacement was at the suprarenal segment in 15 patients, of whom 13 had concomitant major hepatic resection, at the infrarenal segment in 10, at both caval segments in three, and at the renal vein confluence in one. There were two early deaths (6.9%). One patient died intraoperatively of coagulopathy during liver resection and suprarenal IVC replacement. The other death occurred 4 months postoperatively, from multisystem organ failure that resulted in graft infection and occlusion. Twelve patients had one or more major complications- cardiopulmonary problems in five; bleeding in five; chylous ascites or large pleural effusions in two patients each; and lower extremity edema with tibial vein thrombosis in one. The mean follow-up was 2.8 years (range, 2.7 months to 6.3 years). Two late graft occlusions occurred: one at 7.5 months, the other, from tumor recurrence, at 6.3 years. There have been no other late graft-related complications. All 11 late deaths were caused by the progression of malignant disease. Of 16 survivors, 12 have no evidence of disease and four have either regional or distant metastatic recurrence. Initial postoperative performance status was good or excellent for most survivors.\nAggressive surgical management may offer the only chance for cure or palliation of symptoms for patients with primary or secondary IVC tumors. Our experience suggests that vena cava replacement may be performed safely with low graft-related morbidity and good patency in carefully selected patients.",

The purpose of this report is the examination of the influence of cause and risk factors on outcomes for the identification of patients who may be better treated with endovascular techniques or other surgical approaches.\nData for patients who underwent aortic-origin great vessel reconstruction between 1988 and 1998 were reviewed. The data were analyzed with Fisher exact test, life-table analysis, and log-rank test.\nNinety-two vessels underwent revascularization in 58 patients (15 men, 43 women; mean age, 54 years; age range, 20 to 82 years). Etiology was atherosclerosis obliterans (n = 40; 69%), Takayasu's arteritis (n = 13; 22%), radiation arteritis (RA; n = 4; 7%), and mediastinal fibrosis (n = 1; 2%). The symptoms were cerebrovascular (n = 25), upper extremity (n = 8), or both (n = 23), and two patients were asymptomatic. The bypass grafting was performed with single-limb synthetic grafts (n = 23) or grafts plus side arms (n = 28). Seven patients underwent innominate endarterectomy. The mean follow-up period was 45 months (range, 0 to 126 months). The perioperative stroke (n = 4; 7%) and death (n = 2; 3%) rates were not related to the cause of disease.

The patients with hypercoagulable states (ie, thrombophilia; n = 6) had an increased perioperative stroke rate (33% vs 4% for patients without hypercoagulable states; P <.05) and an increased late thrombosis rate. The primary and secondary graft patency rates at 5 years were 80% +/- 7% and 91% +/- 5%, respectively.

Patients with RA have an increased incidence rate of late major infection, which directly contributes to an increased rate of stroke or death. Patients with thrombophilia have an increased rate of late graft thrombosis. These patient conditions should be approached cautiously, and some patients may benefit from endovascular therapy.",

    "abstract": "The surgical repair (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) of symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with co-existent large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) may result in an increased rate of AAA rupture after operation. Simultaneous CABG/AAA repair has been recommended by some surgeons, but with a somewhat higher mortality rate than staged repair. We reviewed the outcome of staged AAA repair that was performed early after CABG in patients with symptomatic coronary disease and AAA.\nThe records of all the patients with symptomatic CAD that required CABG with large AAA (greater than 5 cm) were reviewed. In most patients, CABG was performed first, followed by AAA repair within 2 weeks. Patient demographics, severity of coronary disease, AAA size, interprocedure duration, and perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were examined.\nBetween 1991 and 1998, 1105 AAA repairs were performed. Within this group, 30 patients with AAA underwent CABG for symptomatic CAD. Mean AAA size was 6.6 cm (range, 5.0-10.0 cm). The median interprocedure interval between CABG and AAA repair was 11.5 days. There was no in-hospital AAA rupture during this interval. The patient group was comprised of 24 men and 6 women with a mean age of 71 years. There was no operative death after such staged AAA repair, and nonfatal complications occurred in seven patients (23%). During this period, seven patients had AAA rupture when they were sent home after CABG for recovery and intended AAA repair at a later date.\nStaged elective AAA repair may be performed safely and effectively after CABG. Performance of these procedures with a short interprocedure interval may be preferable to the higher complication rate observed after combined procedures.",

    "abstract": "Our previous experience with the traditional management of infected prosthetic arterial grafts, which included graft excision and vein patch repair of the involved artery, was complicated by a high incidence of vein patch rupture. This study assessed the treatment of infected prosthetic grafts with subtotal graft excision and oversewing of small graft remnants.\nDuring the last 20 years, we treated 53 wounds involving 45 infected prosthetic grafts in 42 patients by means of subtotal graft excision and oversewing of a residual 2- to 3-mm graft remnant (patch) at an intact arterial anastomosis. This technique was selectively used to maintain patency of small-diameter arteries (41 common femoral, five deep femoral, three axillary, two iliac, and two popliteal), which were critical for limb salvage or amputation healing. This strategy avoided difficult dissection of the underlying artery in scarred wounds and obviated the placement of a new patch in an infected field. Graft remnants were polytetrafluoroethylene in 51 cases and Dacron in two cases. Of the 45 grafts, 31 were occluded and 14 were patent. All infected tissue was widely debrided, wet-to-dry dressing changes were performed three times daily, and appropriate intravenous antibiotics were administered for at least 1 week. Secondary bypass grafting procedures were performed as needed to achieve limb salvage. The follow-up period in surviving patients averaged 32 months (range, 1 to 218 months).\nNo complications were directly attributable to prosthetic patch remnants in 92% of cases (49 of 53 cases). Six of 42 patients (14%) died during hospitalization (three of cardiac complications and three of sepsis with multiple organ failure). Two infected pseudoaneurysms developed 8 and 34 months after surgery, and two wounds failed to heal. Sixteen secondary bypass grafting procedures were necessary to achieve limb salvage. Patch oversewing led to limb salvage without the need for secondary revascularization in 26 other cases and to the successful healing of 10 amputated limbs when secondary revascularization was not possible.\nProsthetic patch remnants are a useful adjunct that simplify management of infected prosthetic grafts, are associated with a low incidence of wound complications, and help maintain patency of essential collaterals to achieve limb salvage or heal an amputation.",

    "abstract": "Technology-driven innovation in medicine is frequently associated with higher costs than conventional therapy. A significantly higher cost for endovascular ($21,250, n = 190) versus open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair ($12,342, n = 60) was suggested by a direct cost analysis of patients in a multicenter trial. Estimated inpatient costs (not charges) incurred nationwide by hospitals for endovascular and open repair of AAA were studied to validate these observed trends.\nA retrospective analysis of 131 patients undergoing endovascular AAA repair was compared with 49 patients undergoing open repair as part of a Food and Drug Administration phase II prospective multicenter clinical investigation (AneuRx-Medtronic). A model to estimate costs was constructed using important clinical descriptors of these patients. These clinical characteristics where then matched with those from 22, 460 patients undergoing AAA repair obtained from a large national database (Medicare Provider Analysis and Review). Estimated hospital cost was then assigned to each study patient according to the national average of the total hospital costs for the respective matched patients in Medicare Provider Analysis and Review.\nTotal inpatient hospital costs of endovascular repair were significantly higher than that of open repair ($19,985 +/- 7396 versus $12,546 +/- 5944, respectively, P =.0001). Endograft device cost ($10,400) accounted for 52% of the total cost of endovascular repair. The 1999 mean blended Medicare reimbursement for AAA repair was $18,989.\nIn this early development stage, hospital cost for endovascular AAA repair is significantly greater than open repair when device cost greatly exceeds $5000. Although incremental reductions in cost of endovascular repair may be anticipated if use of diagnostic studies, operating time, and length of stay decrease, device cost has the single greatest impact on the expense of endovascular AAA repair. At current device pricing, mean blended Medicare reimbursement does not cover the cost of endovascular AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Previous study results have shown a favorable impact on stroke rate with an increasing hospital volume of carotid endarterectomies (CEAs). This is not only the most frequently performed peripheral vascular procedure in the United States but also perhaps the most widely dispersed procedure relative to hospital type. Medical centers have adopted various strategies to lower the cost of hospitalization by reducing the length of stay (LOS), the major component of hospital cost. By 2002, the Balanced Budget Act is projected to reduce Medicare provider payments to academic medical centers (AMCs) by 15.5%, a reduction that is twice that for minor or nonteaching hospitals. We assessed the relationships between hospital costs, CEA volume, and stroke-mortality rates in AMCs and non-AMCs in Massachusetts.\nWith patient level data from the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy and with hospital cost and charge reports from the Health Care Financing Administration, HealthShare Technology provided data for all the patients discharged from a Massachusetts hospital who underwent CEA (n = 10,211) during the fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, including cost, LOS, and disposition. The outcomes were further defined with in-hospital stroke and mortality rates. Five high volume AMCs (HVAMCs) were compared with all other nonacademic hospitals, which were further subdivided by annual volume into high volume non-AMCs (> or =50 cases), medium volume non-AMCs (24-49 cases), and low volume non-AMCs (12-23 cases). Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance to compare the means of all the cost and LOS data, and chi(2) test was used for comparison of incidence (significance assumed for P < or =. 05).\nHospital costs were comparable among the four hospital types during individual years and averaged $6200, but HVAMCs were significantly more expensive overall, with a mean cost of $7882. The only centers to decrease their costs during the years evaluated were the HVAMCs, from $8706 to $6784. Length of stay did not differ among the groups in any year or overall, with a mean of 3.8 days, but did decrease between years at HVAMCs from 3.9 to 2.5 days. The combined stroke-mortality rates were significantly less at the HVAMCs (0.9%) than at either the high volume non-AMCs (1.9%) or the medium volume non-AMCs (2.5%). There was no significance in the analysis results of all the data within the low volume non-AMCs.\nPatients in HVAMCs have the best outcomes after CEA. Despite the achievement of significant efficiencies, AMCs have a small cushion to reduce further either LOS or resources to maintain a competitive cost position and to compensate for the fixed expenses of academic medicine. The Balanced Budget Act raises an equity concern for AMCs because it differentially affects the centers with the best outcomes. The financial implication of this may be a direct incentive for procedures to be done in centers with less optimal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Although the United Kingdom small aneurysm trial reported no survival benefit for early operation in patients with small (4. 0-5.5 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the trial lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful gains in life expectancy, particularly for specific subgroups. We used decision analysis to better characterize the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of early surgery.\nWe used a Markov model to assess the marginal cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] saved) of early surgery relative to surveillance for small AAAs, using data from the UK Trial. Subgroup analyses were performed by patient age and AAA diameter. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the effect of elective operative mortality on cost-effectiveness.\nIn our baseline analysis, early operations provided a small survival advantage (0.14 QALYs) at a small incremental cost of $1510. Thus, despite a small survival benefit, early surgery appeared cost-effective ($10, 800/QALY). The small cost differential resulted from the large proportion of patients who underwent surveillance, who eventually underwent AAA repair, and therefore incurred the cost of the surgical procedures. The survival advantage and cost-effectiveness of early operation increased with lower operative mortality, younger age, and larger AAA diameter.\nDespite the negative conclusions of the UK trial, early surgery may be cost-effective for patients with small AAAs, particularly younger patients (<72 years of age) with larger AAAs (> or = 4.5 cm). Because the gains in life expectancy are relatively small, however, clinical decision making should be strongly guided by patient preferences.",

A case of entrapment of the guidewire in the filter after deployment through the right internal jugular approach and its recovery by reentering it into the sheath is presented. To prevent this complication, the guidewire should be removed completely before releasing this type of filter.

    "abstract": "Delayed neurologic deficits are an uncommon yet devastating complication of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The mechanisms involved in the development of delayed spinal cord ischemia remain ill defined. We report a case of complete reversal of delayed neurologic deficits with postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. After a thoracoabdominal aneurysm extent I repair, the patient experienced delayed paraplegia at 6 hours and again at 34 hours after the operation, with elevated CSF pressure (>10 mm Hg) on both occasions. Prompt CSF decompression completely reversed the neurologic deficits within hours after onset. The findings in this case further support the role of CSF drainage in spinal cord protection for patients who undergo thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair and make a plea for a national database collection.",

    "abstract": "Although 60% to 80% of the mature intimal hyperplastic plaque is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, little is known about the factors that stimulate smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to produce these proteins. A major component of the ECM protein is fibronectin. Thus we studied fibronectin production and its response to various growth factors, cytokines, and other ECM proteins that are released at the time of vascular injury.\nQuiescent cultured human SMCs were stimulated for varying intervals with increasing concentrations of agonist. Fibronectin in the cell medium was assayed by immunoblotting with a fibronectin-specific antibody.\nAfter 72 hours of stimulation, transforming growth factor-beta (10 ng/mL) had the most profound effect on fibronectin production (9.6- +/- 2.1-fold; P <.05), followed by epidermal growth factor (100 ng/mL; 5.0- +/- 0.1-fold; P <.05, for both). Surprisingly, the platelet-derived growth factors (AA, AB, and BB) and fibroblast growth factor did not stimulate fibronectin production. Among the matrix proteins studied, only collagen type I (20 microg/mL) stimulated fibronectin production (1.9- +/- 0.1-fold; P <.05), whereas collagen type IV and laminin had no effect. The contractile protein angiotensin II (100 ng/mL) was a weak stimulant of fibronectin (1.6- +/- 0.2-fold; P <.05). Time course studies of fibronectin production up to 72 hours revealed kinetics that varied with each agonist. Transforming growth factor-beta stimulated significant early production of fibronectin, whereas fibronectin production in response to epidermal growth factor and collagen type I was initially modest but increased with time. The effect of angiotensin II did not become evident until 72 hours.\nCytokines, growth factors, and matrix proteins have varying quantitative effects on ECM protein production by human vascular SMCs. Knowledge of the factors that influence ECM protein production may allow for the design of specific inhibitors that can prevent intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is a physiologic mechanism of cell death that regulates mass and architecture in many tissues. Apoptosis has been described as a feature in human vascular atherosclerosis and large vessel structural integrity. We examined the extent of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis in aneurysmal, occlusive, and normal human aortic tissue.\nTissue samples of aneurysmal, occlusive, and normal human infrarenal aorta were evaluated. DNA fragmentation detection methods, immunohistochemistry, and DNA electrophoresis determined VSMC density, VSMC apoptosis, and apoptosis markers. Apoptotic cells and VSMC nuclei were counted with the use of computer-generated image analysis. Aortic subtypes were compared statistically by analysis of variance.\nSeventeen aneurysmal, ten occlusive, and five normal human aortas were evaluated. By alpha(1)-actin immunostaining, VSMC density was least in aneurysmal aortas (271.8 +/- 13.5 cells/high-power field [HPF]) compared with occlusive aorta (278.2 +/- 39.4 cells/HPF) and normal aortas (291.0 +/- 25.4 cells/HPF; P = not significant). Presence of apoptotic VSMCs was demonstrated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase fragment end labeling and propidium iodide nuclear staining. VSMC apoptosis was greatest within aneurysmal aortas with 11.7 +/- 1.5 cells/HPF compared with occlusive aortas with 3.3 +/- 0. 8 cells/HPF (P <.05) and normal aortas with 3.75 +/- 4.6 cells/HPF (P <.05). Significant differences in apoptosis markers, p53 or bcl-2, could not be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry or DNA electrophoresis in aortic subtypes.\nApoptosis of VSMCs is increased and VSMC density is decreased within the medial layer of aneurysmal aortic tissue.

    "abstract": "Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade detection by the host immune system. The herpes simplex gene ICP47 encodes a protein that binds to the host antigen-processing transporter, inhibiting the formation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) antigens in infected cells. MHC-I antigen expression is also important in acute allograft rejection. This study was designed to quantitate the effect of adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of ICP47 on MHC-I cell surface expression of human vascular cells. We hypothesized that the transduction of vascular cells with a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector that was expressing ICP47 (AdICP47) would inhibit constitutive and inducible MHC-I expression and thereby reduce the rate of cytolysis of ICP47-transduced vascular cells by sensitized cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).\nA replication-incompetent adenoviral vector, AdICP47, was created to express ICP47 driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. Cultured human vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and human dermal fibroblasts were transduced with either AdICP47 or the control empty vector AddlE1. Cell surface constitutive and gamma-interferon-induced MHC-I expression were quantitated by flow cytometry. A standard 4-hour chromium release cytotoxicity assay was used to determine the percent cytolysis of transduced and nontransduced endothelial cells by sensitized CTL. Finally, to quantitate the specificity of the effect of ICP47 on MHC-I expression, adhesion molecule expression was quantitated in both transduced and nontransduced cells.\nConstitutive MHC-I expression in AdICP47-transduced endothelial cells was inhibited by a mean of 84% +/- 5% (SEM) in five experiments. After 48 hours of exposure to gamma-interferon, AdICP47-transduced cells exhibited a mean of 66% +/- 8% lower MHC-I expression than nontransduced cells. Similar inhibition in MHC-I expression was achieved in AdICP47-transduced vascular smooth muscle cells and dermal fibroblasts. Percent cytolysis of AdICP47-transduced endothelial cells by CTL was reduced by 72%. Finally, the specificity of the effect of transduction of ICP47 on vascular cell MHC-I expression was confirmed by a lack of significant change in either constitutive or tumor necrosis factor-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule/intercellular adhesion molecule expression.\nTransduction of vascular cells with AdICP47 strongly inhibits both constitutive and inducible MHC-I expression in human vascular cells. AdICP47-transduced cells exhibited a substantial reduction in cytolysis by CTL. Thus AdICP47 transduction holds promise as a technique to characterize the role of MHC-I expression in acute vascular allograft rejection in vivo and as a potential therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Embolic events during carotid angioplasty are a challenging problem. This experimental study was undertaken to determine the embolic risk after each stage of carotid angioplasty procedure.\nFive ex vivo carotid artery balloon angioplasties were performed on fresh carotid specimens. The carotid specimens were obtained from five patients who underwent an internal carotid artery bypass for stenosis >75%. Before the endovascular maneuvers and after each stage of the procedures, the specimens were flushed with 20 mL of saline solution. Small particulate emboli (diameter, <60 microm) were searched in all the effluents according to the Coulter technique. After this procedure, each effluent was also submitted to scanning electron microscopy.\nWhen the stenosis was crossed with the guidewire or the balloon catheter, the number and the mean diameter of embolic particles did not change with three plaques (CP1, CP2, and CP3) and were increased with two plaques (CP4 and CP5). The maximal size of particles was 220 microm (CP5). After balloon angioplasty, the number and the mean diameter of particles increased with CP1, CP2, and CP3. With CP4 and CP5, the number of particles decreased, but their size increased. The maximal size of particles was 1100 microm (CP4).\nCarotid balloon angioplasty generates embolic particles after each stage of the procedure. Techniques of prevention should then be effective from the initial step of the angioplasty procedure, and the selection of patients for carotid angioplasty remains crucial.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in preventing pulmonary embolism while preserving caval flow is significantly affected by its hemodynamic characteristics. Flow fields surrounding two types of IVC filters were compared to assess how the design of a filter may influence performance.\nThe 12F Titanium Greenfield and VenaTech LGM inferior vena cava filters were studied in vitro with a noninvasive flow visualization technique, the photochromic flow visualization and measurement technique. Axial velocity profiles and wall shear stress distributions were measured. These results were compared with analytical data corresponding to the flow field in the absence of a filter to determine the relative extent of the flow disturbances.\nThe reductions in near-wall axial velocity and wall shear stress caused by the VenaTech filter were more extensive and severe than those caused by the Greenfield filter. These changes were the consequence of differences in the geometry and dimensions of the struts of the two filters. The measurements showed the flow fields to be laminar, with no evidence of turbulence in both cases.\nTwo factors that have been linked to thrombogenesis, near-wall velocity and wall-shear stress, were significantly affected by the larger frontal profile area of the VenaTech filter. Although a larger area may increase clot-trapping efficiency, as shown by previous studies, the reduced near-wall velocities and wall shear stresses may increase the potential for thrombogenesis and, thus, caval occlusion. In contrast to other in vitro flow visualization studies, no turbulence was observed with either filter.",

The aim of this study was to measure the changes to these factors after major aortic surgery and the possible inhibitory role of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) during these procedures.\nTwenty-four patients with supraceliac aortic crossclamping during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair and 12 patients with infrarenal aortic crossclamping as part of infrarenal aneurysm repair (AAA) were studied. Blood was collected at incision, aortic clamping, and reperfusion and at 1, 8, and 24 hours after reperfusion. Samples were assayed for endotoxin, peripheral blood monocyte CD14 expression, sCD14, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and TGF-beta(1).\nAlthough there was significant endotoxemia on reperfusion in both groups of patients, peak plasma endotoxin levels were significantly higher in patients with TAAA (P =.001). Monocyte CD14 and plasma sCD14 were significantly decreased in patients with TAAA at reperfusion and 1 hour after reperfusion (P <.01, both points). In patients with AAA, a significant upregulation of CD14 was observed at 24 hours after reperfusion (P <.01), but no significant changes in sCD14 were observed. TNF-alpha showed no significant changes during the study period in both groups. In patients with TAAA, TGF-beta(1) showed significant elevation at all time points (P <.01); whereas in patients with AAA, TGF-beta(1) showed no significant changes.\nSplanchnic ischemia reperfusion in patients who undergo supraceliac aortic clamping is associated with peripheral blood monocyte CD14 suppression and significant elevation of TGF-beta(1). TGF-beta(1) may play an important role in modulating the immune response to endotoxemia during major aortic aneurysm surgery.",

In the era of endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms, a possible reduction of risk of rupture by the presence of thrombus within the aneurysmal sac can be important in relation to the location of an endoleak to the aneurysmal wall and in relation to the effect of the thrombosis of the endoleak, either spontaneously or by intervention.\nIn nine patients who underwent operation for an infrarenal aortic aneurysm by open procedure at the level of the thickest thrombus lining, the pressure within the aneurysmal thrombus (just inside the aneurysmal wall) was measured and compared with the systemic pressure.\nPressure within systemic circulation and aneurysmal thrombus correlated well for the mean pressure (r = 0.90; P <.001) and for pulse pressure (r = 0.74; P <.01) Also, there was agreement between the levels of the mean pressure. Conduction of mean and pulse pressure to the aneurysmal wall was not related to the thickness of the thrombus at the level of the pressure measurement (r = 0.18 and r = 0.08, respectively).\nWe conclude that thrombus within the aneurysm does not reduce both the mean and the pulse pressure near the aneurysmal wall and thus will not reduce the risk of rupture of the aneurysm.",

The correlation between SCTA and laboratory measurements of linear dimensions and volumes was highly accurate (r(2) = 1.0).\nFrom the first 7 patients that were suitable for endoluminal repair, the correlation between SCTA and angiocatheter measurements was 0.85 to 0.99 (P <.04), but there was poor agreement between individual values. As determined from the measurements by 2 experienced investigators, intraobserver and interobserver errors for volume calculation in 12 randomly chosen scans from a total of 120 scans were 5.7 and 4.4 mL, respectively (range of volumes, 100-403 mL). The conditions of 53 patients were judged suitable for endoluminal repair of which 30 patients reached 1 year or more follow-up. The median aneurysm neck length and diameter were 24.5 mm (range, 11.5-60.8 mm) and 23.4 mm (18.3-31.5 mm), respectively. The fate of the sac after endografting by two techniques (pre-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] fixed with Palmaz stents and endografts) was defined with three-dimensional SCTA.\nThe sac volume after endografting by pre-expanded PTFE (n = 12 patients) showed a significant median increase (P =.02) from 129 mL before surgery to 141 mL at 5 days after the operation with no change at 6 (139 mL), 12 (137 mL), and 18 (159 mL) months later. With the endografts (n = 18), there was an initial increase in median volume at 5 days (179-194 mL; P =.02) and then a significant shrinkage at 6 (148 mL; P =.012) and 12 (94.9 mL; P =.02) months.\nThree-dimensional SCTA has been validated and is both precise and reliable. Interobserver and intraobserver errors are within acceptable ranges. Angiocatheter measurements are less accurate and may give misleading information when used for patient selection and endograft construction. The sac volume increased after endografting and later shrank in patients who were treated with endografts, but not in those patients treated with pre-expanded PTFE. We propose that three-dimensional SCTA should be regarded as the gold standard for linear and volumetric measurement for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.",

Angiocatheter measurements are less accurate and may give misleading information when used for patient selection and endograft construction. The sac volume increased after endografting and later shrank in patients who were treated with endografts, but not in those patients treated with pre-expanded PTFE. We propose that three-dimensional SCTA should be regarded as the gold standard for linear and volumetric measurement for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "The flow convergence region (FCR) method (also known as the proximal isovelocity surface area method) is currently used in echocardiography to evaluate the flow through cardiac valves and septal defects. The FCR method is based on the characteristic alterations in flow dynamics that occur proximal to a stenotic orifice. Blood converges uniformly and radially towards an orifice that is small relative to the section of the vessel and forms concentric isovelocity hemispheric shells where velocity progressively increases and flow remains laminar. The purpose of the article is to validate the use of this principle in the detection and assessment of carotid stenoses in the course of color-flow duplex studies.\nIn this prospective study, 80 patients affected by unilateral or bilateral carotid artery stenoses were evaluated for the presence of the FCR from February 1997 to March 1999. The results were compared with digital subtraction angiography.\nColor-flow duplex diagnosis of carotid artery stenoses of 70% or more was confirmed in 100% of the carotid artery stenoses (40/40 patients) with angiography. The FCR was detected in 72.2% (13/18) of carotid arteries affected by stenoses greater than 80%, in 54.4% (12/22) of carotid arteries affected by stenoses 70% to 80%, and in 13.6% (6/44) of carotid arteries affected by stenoses 50% to 69% (P <.001). In 5% of cases (2/40 of stenoses) the FCR was the only detectable sign of carotid stenosis.\nOur data suggest that a routine search for FCR in the course of color-flow duplex study of carotid arteries may further improve the reliability of this examination in the detection of carotid artery stenoses, particularly in the presence of heavily calcified lesions.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed the history and preoperative investigations of patients with early postoperative neurologic events after carotid thromboendarterectomy in an attempt to identify risk factors for neurologic complications.\nPatients with neurologic events/complications (S group, n = 14 patients) were compared with an age- and disease-matched control group (C group, n = 42 patients) selected from the whole carotid thromboendarterectomy material between 1987 and 1996. In this retrospective study, we re-evaluated the maximum systolic and end diastolic flow velocities within the internal carotid artery (ICA) using video recordings of preoperative Duplex ultrasound scan investigations. The flow velocity variables were compared with preoperative carotid angiography and intraoperative ICA stump pressure measurement.\nS-group did not differ from C-group concerning either cardiovascular risk factors or diseases, ipsilateral and contralateral angiographic grade of ICA stenosis, or history of cerebral infarctions. Nevertheless, in contrast to control subjects, patients with early postoperative major stroke had higher end diastolic flow velocities and lower ICA stump pressures. Patients with postoperative minor stroke, transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis fugax did not differ significantly from the control subjects. Among patients with ICA stenosis of 75% or more, end diastolic flow velocities were correlated to the diastolic stump pressures.\nDiastolic flow velocities within severe internal carotid artery stenosis are dependent on the level of the collateral perfusion pressure distally to the stenosis (ie, high values indicate a low internal carotid artery stump pressure), which seems to be a risk factor for early postoperative strokes.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a physiologic method to measure outflow and inflow from the lower extremities and thus to quantify the degree of venous valvular insufficiency and venous obstructive disease.\nCalibrated photoplethysmography was used in combination with passive changes in hydrostatic pressure, by leg elevation followed by repositioning of the leg to the original sitting position. With the principle of venous occlusion plethysmography, timed volume changes were then used to calculate the outflow and inflow. The inflow and outflow units were the percentage of optical reflectance (%OR) per minute. The respective resistances were calculated by identifying the hydrostatic pressure distance from the third intercostal space to the probe site that is inducing these site changes. The resistance units were millimeters of Mercury x minutes per %OR.\nFour groups of subjects were examined: normal individuals, patients with venous valvular insufficiency, deep venous thrombosis, and a combination of both. The most significant differences in outflow values were found between the control group (81.77% OR/min) and the deep venous thrombosis group (28.47% OR/min). In contrast, the most significant differences in inflow values were found between the control group (9. 67% OR/min) and the venous valvular insufficiency group (108.61% OR/min). The resistances changed correspondingly.\nThe application of calibrated photoplethysmography in conjunction with induced changes in leg hydrostatic pressure proved to be an effective physiologic method to noninvasively quantify venous hemodynamics in normal control subjects, patients with venous valvular insufficiency, venous obstructive disease, or both.",

    "abstract": "The overall incidence of congenital vascular malformations in the general population is 1.5%. Approximately two thirds of them are malformations of venous predominance. Abnormalities of the deep venous trunks have been observed in association with large superficial compensatory varices in these type of malformations. Knowledge of the integrity of the deep venous system is important in their management because excision of the enlarged superficial veins may be deleterious if there is aplasia or hypoplasia of the deep venous trunks. The objective was to investigate the prevalence and nature of deep venous anomalies that occur in patients with congenital vascular malformations of venous predominance both in our series and in the series from the medical literature.\nFrom the last 35 years of medical literature, we reviewed seven series of congenital vascular malformations that provided pertinent information on the subject of our study. We also reviewed our own series of 392 patients with congenital vascular malformations studied at Children's Hospital of Mexico City (1963-1983; n = 223 children) and at Walter Reed Army and National Naval Medical Centers (1984-1998; n = 169 children). Of 392 patients, 257 (65.5%) had malformations of venous predominance; these were the subject of our analysis. Prevalence of the following deep venous anomalies was recorded: phlebectasia, aplasia or hypoplasia of venous trunks, aneurysms, and avalvulia. Diagnosis was made by one or more of the following methods: Doppler scanning, duplex scanning, plethysmography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography.\nAt least one anomaly of the deep venous system was present in 47% of the congenital vascular malformations of venous predominance reviewed. Phlebectasia was recorded in 36% of the cases, and aplasia or hypoplasia of deep venous trunks was observed in 8% of the cases. Venous aneurysms also were present in 8% of the cases; avalvulia was recorded in 7% of the cases.\nAnomalies of the deep venous system occur in almost one half of congenital vascular malformations of venous predominance. The most common is the relatively innocuous phlebectasias that occur in over one third of cases. Aplasia/hypoplasia, venous aneurysms, and avalvulia were less frequent, each less than 10%; but failure to detect the latter three anomalies may lead to serious therapeutic errors.",

    "abstract": "The superficial femoral popliteal vein (SFPV) has been used as an alternative conduit for both arterial and venous reconstructive surgery. Its popularity continues to grow, despite concern about the potential for venous morbidity after harvest. The purpose of this study was to determine an anatomic \"safe\" length of SFPV for harvest, assuming that the preservation of at least one valve and one significant collateral vein in the remaining popliteal vein (PV) segment can minimize venous morbidity.\nForty-four SFPVs were harvested from 39 cadaveric specimens. The length of both the superficial femoral vein (SFV) and PV was measured, and the number and location of valves and significant side branches (more than 2 mm in diameter) of the PV were measured. The Student two-tailed t test was used as a means of comparing vein lengths between the sexes. Correlation coefficients were determined for the effect of patient height on vein length, stratified by means of sex.\nVein length (SFV mean, 24.4 +/- 4 cm; PV mean, 18.8 +/- 4 cm) varied with sex (male SFV mean, 28.1 +/- 5 cm; male PV mean, 21. 5 +/- 3 cm; female SFV mean, 22.6 +/- 4 cm; female PV mean, 18.4 +/- 3 cm; P =.01). Valve number (mean, 1.8 +/- 0.5) and location and collateral vein number (mean, 5 +/- 1.8) and location were variable and independent of height or sex.\nAn anatomic \"safe\" length of SFPV for harvest to minimize venous morbidity would include all the SFV and 12 cm of PV in 95% of women and 15 cm of PV in 95% of men. We found that the male sex was a significant determinant for a longer safe length of vein that can be harvested.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial occlusive diseases (PAODs) not only compromise blood flow but lead to a series of subsequent metabolic and structural changes in the relevant muscles. Changes in myofibrillar proteins (eg, of myosin heavy chain [MHC] isoforms), one of the determinants of muscle structure as well as of muscular function, have not been reported in patients with PAOD and were therefore the aim of this study.\nThirteen consecutive patients with PAOD were examined (clinical stage according to Fontaine II, three patients; III, three patients, and IV, seven patients) and compared with five age-matched control patients who had been in traffic accidents. A calf muscle sample (gastrocnemius muscle) in the ischemic region was taken for MHC isoform analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stain, and the relative content of MHC isoforms was measured.\nCompared with the control patients, there was no significant change of MHC isoforms in patients with PAOD II. In patients with PAOD III, MHC IIb decreased significantly (P <.05) although MHC IIa remained unchanged; in patients with PAOD IV, both MHC IIa and IIb decreased significantly (P <.05). Accordingly, there was a progressive increase of the relative amount of MHC I with more critical ischemia in PAOD.\nIn patients with PAOD, the content of MHC II decreased with a higher grade of ischemia. That seems to be consistent with an increased resistance to ischemia for myosin isoforms in the order of I more than in IIa more than IIb. Whether the decrease of MHC II in patients with PAOD is related to atrophy of muscle fibers or to muscle-fiber transition must be investigated further.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and efficacy of the tourniquet in lower limb revascularization.\nDuring a 3-year period, 195 patients underwent 205 infrainguinal reconstruction operations in the lower extremity. These patients underwent bypass with a tourniquet and inflow occlusion (group 1) or bypass without a tourniquet (group 2). The type of infrainguinal reconstruction, tourniquet ischemia time, blood loss, and complications related to tourniquet use were recorded. A subset of patients underwent serial muscle biopsies. Specimens from calf muscle were taken just (1) before application of the tourniquet, (2) before tourniquet release, and (3) once wound closure was initiated. These biopsy specimens were studied by histochemical staining and also analyzed for phosphorylase enzyme, a marker for subcellular ischemia.\nOne hundred eleven patients underwent 117 infrainguinal reconstruction procedures in which the tourniquet and inflow occlusion were used. These patients were matched against 84 patients who underwent 88 infrainguinal reconstructions without the use of the tourniquet. Complete hemostatic control in group 1 was obtained in 108 of the procedures (92%). Eight percent of the procedures required minor additional techniques to obtain complete hemostasis; in two instances, the tourniquet was removed because it did not provide hemostasis. Mean tourniquet time was less than 1 hour for all reconstruction groups. There were no instances of neurologic deficit, thrombosis of distal vessels, or vascular injury that was related to the use of a tourniquet. A comparison of the two groups revealed no differences with regard to overall blood loss (P =.63) or duration of operation (P = 0.60), observations that reflect the complexity of the cases rather than the use or nonuse of a tourniquet. When tourniquet control was used, we noted a definite decrease in the time for the distal dissection, because total vascular control with extensive dissection was unnecessary. Histochemical analysis with phosphorylase revealed a conversion of tissue with active enzyme activity to a low level with tourniquet use (P <.05).\nThe use of a tourniquet for lower limb revascularization is safe and effective and improves visualization of the operative field. Less dissection of the target vessels is required. With a combination of the nonuse of clamps and other occluding devices, we project a decrease in host hyperplastic response that will, in turn, impact favorably on patency rates. The possibility exists that early failure may be prevented by avoiding the application of traumatic forces to diseased and brittle or calcified arteries. In this study, tourniquet time had no impact on overall operative procedural time, although certain phases of the operation were clearly shortened and facilitated, particularly in complex and difficult reconstructions. Histochemical changes found in muscle biopsy specimens did not adversely impact patients clinically, but further investigation is required to elucidate subcellular events.",

    "abstract": "Arterial allografts (AAs) have been recently reconsidered in the treatment of critical limb ischemia when vein material is absent, because of the disappointing results with artificial grafts. The aim of this study was to report the results observed in three centers where AAs were used for infrainguinal reconstruction in limb-threatening ischemia.\nBetween 1991 and 1997, 165 AA bypass procedures were performed in 148 patients (male, 90) with a mean age of 70 years (range, 20-93 years). Indications for operation were rest pain in 54 cases and tissue loss in 111 cases. Mean resting ankle pressure was 53 mm Hg in 96 patients who did not have diabetes and mean transcutaneous pressure of oxygen was 10 mm Hg in 52 patients who did have diabetes. In 123 cases (75%), there was at least one previous revascularization on the same limb. AAs were obtained from cadaveric donors. The distal anastomosis was to the below-knee popliteal artery in 34 cases, to a tibial artery in 114 cases, and to a pedal artery in 17 cases.\nAt 30 days, the mortality rate was 3.4%; the primary patency rate was 83.3%; the secondary patency rate was 90%; and the limb salvage rate was 98%. During follow-up (mean, 31 months), 65 grafts failed primarily. Causes of primary failure were thought to be progression of the distal disease in 15 cases, myointimal hyperplasia in 16 cases, graft degradation in 10 cases (four dilations, three stenoses, two ruptures, and one dissection), miscellaneous in eight cases, and not known in 16 cases. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were, respectively, 48.7% +/- 4%, 34.9% +/- 6%, and 16.1% +/- 7%. Secondary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were, respectively, 59. 8% +/- 4%, 42.1% +/- 5%, and 25.9% +/- 8%. Limb salvage rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were, respectively, 83.8% +/- 3%, 76.4% +/- 5%, and 74.2 % +/- 8%.\nAA leads to an acceptable limb salvage rate but poor patency rates.

Most of the reported cases of jugular venous thrombosis have occurred in the presence of an indwelling venous catheter, an established hypercoagulable state, or in association with head and neck sepsis. This report presents a case of a patient in whom jugular venous thrombosis developed during the first trimester of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization. Thromboembolism in these circumstances can be related to a condition known as the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The presentation of severe neck pain in pregnant women, especially in those who have undergone assisted reproduction procedures, should prompt evaluation by duplex scan to evaluate the jugular veins for thrombosis. Anticoagulation is the treatment of choice.",

    "abstract": "Use of intraoperative monitoring with transcranial Doppler scanning during carotid endarterectomy has enabled identification of embolus signals in the ultrasound spectrum. Extension of this technique to preoperative screening has enabled identification of actively embolizing lesions and correlation with neurologic deficits. We report embolus signals in the peripheral circulation before operation, which aided diagnosis and decision to operate. The patient had been transferred from another institution after multiple revascularization procedures, including posterior tibial artery thrombectomy. Angiography performed on arrival at our institution confirmed an open bypass graft, although a small indentation was noted at the site of the previous posterior tibial artery thrombectomy. Runoff was intact to the plantar arch where there was attenuation of that vessel and occlusion of most digital branches. Duplex monitoring revealed no embolic signals in the graft or in the posterior tibial artery proximal to the previous arteriotomy. Distal to this site, embolic signals were detected. At the time of operation, a large platelet thrombus was identified at the site of the previous arteriotomy, and platelet thrombus was obtained from the plantar artery. It is concluded that doppler ultrasound scanning enables detection of peripheral embolization and the identification and location of lesions with such embolic activity. Diagnostic accuracy may be improved when there is clinical suspicion of embolization, enabling better patient selection for surgical procedures. This report provides the first clinicopathologic characterization of the emboli detected.",

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are relatively rare paragangliomas that develop from neural crest cells at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. They are generally slow growing and benign. Excision is currently considered the treatment of choice, although vascular and especially neural injuries are still relatively frequent in patients with large or bilaterally resected tumors. The baroreflex failure syndrome (BFS) has recently been identified as a severe, rarely recognized, and certainly underestimated complication after the bilateral excision of CBTs. The present report describes a case of a bilateral CBT followed by BFS and reviews the experiences reported in the literature. In light of the low incidence of malignancy of these tumors, their biologic behavior, their very high rate of cranial nerve palsy, and the occurrence of BFS in bilaterally resected paragangliomas, the current practice of bilaterally removing these tumors is questioned.",

    "abstract": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent mitogen secreted by endothelial cells (ECs) in culture and is a putative factor in vascular lesion development. The purpose of this study was to examine whether smooth muscle cells (SMCs) inhibit EC secretion of ET-1. The effect of SMCs on EC ET-1 and constitutively expressed nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity was examined by using a bilayer co-culture model. SMCs inhibited both EC ET-1 protein and RNA levels, compared with ECs cultured alone. SMCs increased EC NO production when compared with ECs cultured alone. In addition, SMC inhibition of EC ET-1 production could be blocked by the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester. ECs stimulated SMC proliferation, and the ET-1 AB and B receptor blockers inhibited EC stimulation of SMC proliferation. The ET-1 A blocker had no effect on SMC proliferation. We conclude that SMCs regulate EC ET-1 and ecNOS synthase transcript levels and protein levels. SMC inhibition of ET-1 production by ECs may be mediated through SMC-modulated changes in EC NO activity. Finally, EC stimulation of SMC proliferation in bilayer co-culture is mediated by ET-1 through the ET-1 B receptor.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to test whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) participates in arterialized vein graft remodeling.\nRabbits underwent in vivo gene transfer and carotid interposition vein grafting. Segments of external jugular vein were infected with an adenovirus that expressed antisense bFGF RNA (Ad.ASbFGF) at 1 x 10(10) PFU/mL to inhibit new synthesis of bFGF by cells in the vein graft wall. Control rabbits were treated with either adenovirus that encoded beta-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) at 1 x 10(10) PFU/mL or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline solution [PBS]). At 3 days, 3 grafts per treatment group were harvested for the determination of gene expression of ASbFGF RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Rabbits were killed, and perfusion was fixed 2 months after the grafting. Total wall thickness and lumen circumference of vein grafts and normal arteries were measured in cross sections. Calculated mean tangential stress (+/-SD) for the ASbFGF-treated group and controls was compared for significance. Grafts were immunohistochemically stained to assess bFGF protein production.\nOnly the grafts infected with the Ad.ASbFGF gene expressed ASbFGF RNA. Grafts that were treated with Ad.ASbFGF displayed lower tangential stress (10.9 +/- 2.3 dynes/cm(2)) than PBS alone (22 +/- 2.8 dynes/cm(2)) or Ad. lacZ-treated controls (20.6 +/- 5.4 dynes/cm(2); P <.001). Tangential stress in the Ad.ASbFGF group was comparable to a normal carotid artery (13.9 +/- 2.1 dynes/cm(2)). The difference in mean total wall thickness was significant among the 3 treatment groups: Ad.ASbFGF, 164 +/- 3.4 microm); Ad.lacZ, 100 +/- 3.3 microm; and PBS, 96 +/- 3.6 microm; P <.01). Luminal circumference was not different among the groups. The Ad.ASbFGF-treated vein graft wall was composed of thick layers of concentric smooth muscle cells and elastin fibers in contrast to the sponge-like appearance observed in control arterialized vein grafts. Reduction in bFGF protein was noted only in the Ad.ASbFGF-treated group.\nInhibition of bFGF synthesis in vivo with the use of adenoviral gene transfer of antisense RNA to bFGF promotes a vein graft with decreased tangential stress while maintaining the luminal area. The vein graft wall is remodeled and qualitatively resembles an artery so that wall tangential stress in Ad.ASbFGF and normal artery are not significantly different. The lack of significant difference in lumen circumference among groups suggests that wall thickening in the Ad. ASbFGF grafts is not at the expense of luminal narrowing. Our results suggest that ASbFGF RNA expression may represent an effective strategy in limiting the failure of arterialized venous conduits.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is believed to occur when the mechanical stress acting on the wall exceeds the strength of the wall tissue. Therefore, knowledge of the stress distribution in an intact AAA wall could be useful in assessing its risk of rupture. We developed a methodology to noninvasively estimate the in vivo wall stress distribution for actual AAAs on a patient-to-patient basis.\nSix patients with AAAs and one control patient with a nonaneurysmal aorta were the study subjects. Data from spiral computed tomography scans were used as a means of three-dimensionally reconstructing the in situ geometry of the intact AAAs and the control aorta. We used a nonlinear biomechanical model developed specifically for AAA wall tissue. By means of the finite element method, the stress distribution on the aortic wall of all subjects under systolic blood pressure was determined and studied.\nIn all the AAA cases, the wall stress was complexly distributed, with distinct regions of high and low stress. Peak wall stress among AAA patients varied from 29 N/cm(2) to 45 N/cm(2) and was found on the posterior surface in all cases studied. The wall stress on the nonaneurysmal aorta in the control subject was relatively low and uniformly distributed, with a peak wall stress of 12 N/cm(2). AAA volume, rather than AAA diameter, was shown by means of statistical analysis to be a better indicator of high wall stresses and possibly rupture.\nThe approach taken to estimate AAA wall stress distribution is completely noninvasive and does not require any additional involvement or expense by the AAA patient. We believe that this methodology may allow for the evaluation of an individual AAA's rupture risk on a more biophysically sound basis than the widely used 5-cm AAA diameter criterion.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of elevated homocysteine levels on adrenergic contraction of human resistance arteries and tested the hypothesis that homocysteine-induced generation of reactive oxygen species contributes to vascular reactivity changes.\nSmall (<200 microm) subcutaneous arteries were cannulated and pressurized in an arteriograph chamber that allowed the measurement of lumen diameter. Two arteries from the same patient were obtained; one was perfused and superfused (intraluminal pressure = 50 mm Hg) with physiologic saline solution (control, n = 6), and the other was perfused and superfused with physiologic saline solution plus 200 micromol/L homocysteine (HC, n = 6); the reactivity to adrenergic stimulation was assessed. Another group of arteries was incubated in 200 micromol/L homocysteine plus 1200 U/mL superoxide dismutase and 120 U/mL catalase (HC + SC, n = 6), and the reactivity to norepinephrine was determined. The vasoreactivity of homocysteine was further assessed in intact (n = 6) and denuded (n = 6) arteries that were precontracted with an intermediate concentration of norepinephrine and homocysteine (20-200 micromol/L) added to the bath while the lumen diameter was continuously recorded.\nSensitivity to norepinephrine was diminished in HC arteries, which increased the median effective concentration (EC(50)) from 0.24 +/- 0.06 micromol/L in control arteries to 0.65 +/- 0.10 micromol/L in HC arteries (P <.01). Homocysteine also caused concentration-dependent vasodilation of arteries contracted with an intermediate concentration of norepinephrine that was greater in intact than denuded arteries, with the half-maximum responses occurring at 61 +/- 6 micromol/L (intact) and 90 +/- 11 micromol/L (denuded; P <.05). There was no significant difference in sodium nitroprusside sensitivity between control and homocysteine arteries (EC(50) = 61 +/- 3 nmol/L vs 50 +/- 19 nmol/L; P >.05) or in sensitivity to acetylcholine (EC(50) = 19 +/- 7 nmol/L vs 12 +/- 3 nmol/L; P >.05). Arteries in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase had similarly impaired reactivity to norepinephrine as did homocysteine arteries (EC(50), 0.58 +/- 0.15 micromol/L; P >.05 vs HC, P <.01 vs control).\nAn elevated homocysteine level in vitro diminishes adrenergic contraction, with a differential endothelial versus smooth muscle influence that appears unrelated to the generation of reactive oxygen species.",

Samples were assayed for the myocardial specific protein troponin-T, total antioxidant status, and lipid hydroperoxides.\nTen patients experienced cardiac dysfunction in the first 24 hours after surgery (eight patients in the TAAA group and two patients in the AAA group). Immediately after reperfusion, total antioxidant status levels dropped in all patients with TAAA and with AAA; this was more marked in patients with TAAA, leading to a significant difference between the two groups at this time point and for up to 1 hour thereafter (P <.01). Patients with TAAA showed a sharp rise in lipid hydroperoxide levels immediately after reperfusion, and levels were significantly higher than in patients with AAA (P =.0007). In patients with AAA, no significant change in troponin-T was observed throughout the study period; whereas in patients with TAAA, levels were significantly elevated at 8 and 24 hours after reperfusion (P <.01). Troponin-T levels significantly correlated with total antioxidant status (r = -0.5) and lipid hydroperoxides (r = 0.78) but not with systolic blood pressure.\nSupracoeliac aortic crossclamping is associated with a significant release of the myocardial injury marker troponin-T. This seems to correlate with the severity of oxidative rather than hemodynamic stresses. Ameliorating oxidative injury during TAAA surgery may therefore have a cardioprotective effect.",

Immediately after reperfusion, total antioxidant status levels dropped in all patients with TAAA and with AAA; this was more marked in patients with TAAA, leading to a significant difference between the two groups at this time point and for up to 1 hour thereafter (P <.01). Patients with TAAA showed a sharp rise in lipid hydroperoxide levels immediately after reperfusion, and levels were significantly higher than in patients with AAA (P =.0007). In patients with AAA, no significant change in troponin-T was observed throughout the study period; whereas in patients with TAAA, levels were significantly elevated at 8 and 24 hours after reperfusion (P <.01). Troponin-T levels significantly correlated with total antioxidant status (r = -0.5) and lipid hydroperoxides (r = 0.78) but not with systolic blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "The early and late outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) following a rigid protocol of patch angioplasty or occasionally interposition bypass grafting, when the arteriotomy required to obtain a complete internal carotid end point extended distal to the bulb segment, and primary closure, when it was limited to the bulb, were studied.\nFrom November 1983 to August 1998, 1360 consecutive primary CEAs were performed on 1133 patients (621 men, 512 women), with a mean age of 67 years. Of these patients, 3.8% (51) had primary closure, 66.4% (903) had greater saphenous vein patch angioplasty, 28.4% (386) had synthetic (359 Dacron, 27 polytetrafluoroethylene) patch angioplasty, and 1.4% (20) had vein interposition bypass grafting procedures. Indications were transient ischemic attack in 34.7% of patients (472), stroke in 16.6% of patients (226), nonlateralizing symptoms in 10.9% of patients (148), and asymptomatic stenosis 70% or greater in 37.8% of patients (514). The mean follow-up period was 4.6 years.\nThe 30-day mortality rate was 1.0% (13 patients; 11 cardiac-related deaths, 2 strokes). The 30-day stroke rate was 1.3% (18 patients; 13 ipsilateral strokes, 5 major, 8 minor). The combined 30-day stroke and death rate was 2.1%. Four of the strokes (1 death) were caused by the hyperperfusion syndrome. The 30-day ipsilateral major stroke or mortality rate was 1.2% (16 patients). The 30-day rate of ipsilateral major stroke or death from stroke was 0.4% (5 patients). There were two synthetic and one vein patch internal carotid occlusions in 30 days. Synthetic-patched CEAs were predicted by means of Cox proportional hazards analysis to have higher risk ratios than saphenous vein-patched CEAs for early and late stroke (1. 3; 95% CI, 1.7 to 1.0; P =.04), for 50% or greater restenosis (2.4; 95% CI, 3.4 to 1.6; P <.001), and for 70% or greater restenosis (2. 5; 95% CI, 3.6 to 1.7; P <.001). The cumulative mortality rate (Kaplan-Meier) was 13% at 5 years and 31% at 10 years. The cumulative stroke rate was 7% at 5 years and 14% at 10 years. The 50% or greater restenosis rate was higher in women than in men at 5 years (9% versus 5%; P =.02, Wilcoxon), but tended to equalize later. The 50% or greater restenosis rate was higher in synthetic-patched CEAs than in saphenous vein-patched CEAs (12% versus 1% at 1 year; 17% versus 3% at 4 years; and 24% versus 10% at 8 years; P <.001 by means of log-rank and Wilcoxon). Restenosis after 5 years was more frequently located in the distal common carotid artery (13 of 20 cases). Late reoperations were more frequent and occurred earlier in synthetic-patched CEAs (eight cases at a mean of 1.6 years) than vein-patched CEAs (14 cases at a mean of 6.9 years; P =.01). No strokes and one restenosis of 50% or greater occurred in the 51 primarily closed CEAs.\nPatch angioplasty reconstruction of CEAs with arteriotomies that extend distal to the carotid bulb gives excellent early and long-term outcomes. Saphenous vein-patched CEAs are superior to synthetic patched CEAs for stroke and restenosis prevention.

    "abstract": "Extracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms (EICAs) can be treated by carotid ligation or surgical reconstruction. In the consideration of the risk of stroke after internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, the aim of this study was to report the results of reconstructive surgery for these aneurysms, including lesions located at the base of the skull.\nFrom 1980 to 1997, 25 ICA reconstructions were performed for EICA: 22 male patients and 3 female patients (mean age, 54.4 years). The cause was atherosclerosis (n = nine patients), dysplasia (n = 12 patients), trauma (n = three patients), and undetermined (n = one patient). The symptoms were focal in 15 cases (12 hemispheric, three ocular), nonfocal in three cases (trouble with balance and visual blurring), and glossopharyngeal nerve compression in one case. Six cases were asymptomatic, including three cases that were diagnosed during surveillance after ICA dissection. In nine cases, the upper limit of the EICA reached the base of the skull. A combined approach with an ear, nose, and throat surgeon allowed exposure and control of the ICA.\nAfter operation, there were no deaths, one temporary stroke, two transient ischemic attacks, and 11 cranial nerve palsies (one with sequelae). The ICA was patent on the postoperative angiogram in all but one case. During follow-up (mean, 66 months), there were two deaths (myocardial infarction), one occurrence of focal epileptic seizure at 2 months, and one transient ischemic attack at 2 years. In December 1998, duplex scanning showed patency of the reconstructed ICA in all but one surviving patient.\nSurgical reconstruction is a satisfactory therapeutic choice for EICA, even when located at the base of the skull.",

Thus, information about immediate and long-term results of surgical therapy is sparse. This review was conducted to elucidate etiology, presentation, and treatment for ECA aneurysms.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the case records of the Texas Heart Institute/St Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston, and found 67 cases of ECA aneurysms treated surgically (the largest series to date) between 1960 and 1995: 38 pseudoaneurysms after previous carotid surgery and 29 atherosclerotic or traumatic aneurysms. All aneurysms were surgically explored, and all were repaired except two: a traumatic distal internal carotid artery aneurysm and an infected pseudoaneurysm in which the carotid artery was ligated.\nFour deaths (three fatal strokes and one myocardial infarction) and two nonfatal strokes were directly attributed to a repaired ECA aneurysm (overall mortality/major stroke incidence, 9%); there was one minor stroke (incidence, 1.5%). The incidence of cranial nerve injury was 6% (four cases).

    "abstract": "The long-term patency for infrapopliteal bypass grafting with prosthetic material is less than optimal. Our experience demonstrates a 40% patency at 2 years for these grafts. Several adjuvant techniques have been developed to improve patency rates, two of which are a remote distal arteriovenous fistula and the creation of a distal vein cuff. This study summarizes our experience with these two techniques.\nBetween 1987 and 1998, 107 bypass graftings were performed to the below-knee popliteal or tibial vessels with the use of polytetrafluoroethylene. One group (48 bypass grafts) had polytetrafluoroethylene with adjuvant distal arteriovenous fistula (DAVF), and a second group (59 bypass grafts) was reconstructed with a distal vein cuff (DVC). The type of bypass grafting that was performed was based on surgeon experience and preference. Indications and demographics were similar in the two groups. All patients underwent the operation for limb-threatening ischemia, including gangrene (DAVF, 23%; DVC, 9%), ulceration (DAVF, 27%; DVC, 51%), and rest pain (DAVF, 50%; DVC, 40%).\nThe primary patency rate was 48% and 38% at 3 years for DAVF and DVC, respectively. Secondary patency was 48% and 47% at 3 years, with limb salvage rates of 76% and 92% for DAVF and DVC, respectively (P <.05). Attempted thrombectomy without continuation of patency was undertaken in two patients with a failed DAVF. Attempts at restoration after thrombosis were made in eight patients with failed DVCs. Five patients underwent thrombectomy, of which four procedures were successful. Three patients had thrombolytic therapy, and two of these remained patent.\nAdjuvant techniques, including DAVF and DVC, produce acceptable long-term patency and limb salvage rates in bypass grafts performed to the below-knee popliteal and tibial vessels. This study suggests that DVCs may offer improved limb salvage rates and a greater opportunity for revision when bypass graft failure occurs.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate whether critical limb ischemia influences hemorheologic variables and whether the rheologic variables in blood from the affected limb differ from the general circulation. We also intended to study whether successful infrainguinal reconstruction improved hemorheologic variables.\nTen consecutive patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) underwent arterial reconstruction, one patient with profundaplasty and nine patients with bypass procedures. Venous blood was sampled from the antecubital vein (arm) and the femoral vein (leg) of the affected limb 1 day before and 1 month after surgery. Ten control subjects (matched according to age, sex, diabetic status, and renal insufficiency) were also sampled. Whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation tendency, and erythrocyte fluidity (the latter variable describing the deformability of the erythrocytes) were measured by means of rotational viscometry. Erythrocyte volume fraction was also determined. Fibrinogen was measured in the patients with CLI.\nErythrocyte fluidity, blood viscosity, and erythrocyte volume fraction were lower in patients with CLI than in control subjects (P <.01, P <.01, and P <.05, respectively). No major differences between cubital and femoral vein blood were seen before or after the operation in patients with CLI or in control subjects. Successful revascularization did not influence the hemorheologic variables, except for a decrease in blood viscosity in femoral vein blood (P <.05).\nHemorheologic properties was impaired in patients with CLI. Because no differences were seen between the systemic and local circulation and because no major improvement occurred 1 month after arterial reconstruction, other mechanisms besides local tissue ischemia may play a role.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate intraoperative duplex scanning of infrainguinal vein bypass grafts to detect technical and hemodynamic problems, monitor their repair, and correlate findings with the incidence of thrombosis and stenosis repair rates within 90 days of operation.\nColor duplex scanning was used at operation to assess vein/anastomotic patency and velocity spectra waveforms of 626 infrainguinal vein bypass grafts (in situ saphenous, 228 grafts; nonreversed translocated saphenous, 170 grafts; reversed saphenous, 147 grafts; alternative [arm, lesser saphenous], 81 grafts) to the popliteal (n = 267 grafts), infrageniculate (n = 323 grafts), or pedal artery (n = 36 grafts). The entire bypass graft was scanned after intragraft injection of papaverine hydrochloride (30-60 mg) to augment graft flow. Vein/anastomotic/artery segments with velocity spectra that indicate highly disturbed flow (peak systolic velocity, >180 cm/sec; spectral broadening; velocity ratio at site, >3) were revised. Grafts with a low peak systolic velocity less than 30 to 40 cm/s and high outflow resistance (absent diastolic flow) underwent procedures (distal arteriovenous fistula, sequential bypass grafting) to augment flow; if this was not possible, the grafts were treated with an antithrombotic regimen, including heparin, dextran, and antiplatelet therapy.\nDuplex scanning prompted revision of 104 lesions in 96 (15%) bypass grafts, including 82 vein/anastomotic stenoses, 17 vein segments with platelet thrombus, and 5 low-flow grafts. Revision rate was highest (P <.01) for alternative vein bypass grafts (27%) compared with the other grafting methods (reversed vein bypass grafts, 10%; nonreversed translocated, 13%; in situ, 16%). A normal intraoperative scan on initial imaging (n = 464 scans) or after revision (n = 67 scans) was associated with a 30-day thrombosis rate of 0.2% and a revision rate of 0.8% for duplex-detected stenosis (peak systolic velocity, >300 cm/s; velocity ratio, >3.5). By comparison, 20 of 95 bypass grafts (21%) with a residual (n = 29 grafts) or unrepaired duplex stenosis (n = 53 grafts) or low flow (n = 13 grafts) had a corrective procedure for graft thrombosis (n = eight grafts) or stenosis (n = 12 grafts; P <.001). Overall, 8% of patients with bypass grafts underwent a corrective procedure within 90 days of operation. Secondary graft patency was 99.4% at 30 days and 98.8% at 90 days (eight graft failures).\nThe observed 15% intraoperative revision rate coupled with a low 90-day failure/revision rate (2.5%) for bypasses with normal papaverine-augmented duplex scans supports the routine use of this diagnostic modality to enhance the precision and early results of infrainguinal vein bypass procedures.",

The main outcome measures were lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]), fasting glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, treadmill times to onset and maximal claudication pain, cardiopulmonary function (peak oxygen uptake), and ankle/brachial index.\nWith exercise rehabilitation, treadmill times to onset and maximal claudication pain increased by 106% and 64% (P <.0001), whereas peak oxygen uptake increased 7% (P <.05). Exercise rehabilitation lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels by 5.2% (P <.005) and 8% (P <.01), respectively. Systolic blood pressure declined by 5.7% (P <.05) with no change in diastolic blood pressure. These changes in cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations were related to their initial values. All other cardiovascular risk factors measured did not change. There was no correlation between improvement of cardiovascular risk factors and functional performance measurements. None of the variables measured changed significantly in the control group.\nExercise rehabilitation not only improves functional performance, but also results in favorable alterations in cardiovascular risk factor profile, which is an important element in the management of PAOD.",

    "abstract": "The effects of upper-limb (arm cranking) and lower-limb (leg cranking) exercise training on walking distances in patients with intermittent claudication was assessed.\nSixty-seven patients (33 to 82 years old) with moderate to severe intermittent claudication were recruited, and the maximum power generated during incremental upper- and lower-limb ergometry tests was determined, as were pain-free and maximum walking distances (by using a shuttle walk test). Patients were randomly assigned to an upper-limb training group (n = 26) or a lower-limb training group (n = 26). An additional untrained group (n = 15) was recruited on an ad hoc basis in parallel with the main trial by using identical inclusion criteria. This group was subsequently shown to possess a similar demographic distribution to the two exercise groups. Supervised training sessions were held twice weekly for 6 weeks.\nBoth training programs significantly improved the maximum power generated during the incremental upper- and lower-limb ergometry tests (P <. 001), which may reflect an increase in central cardiovascular function that was independent of the training mode. More importantly, pain-free and maximum walking distances also improved in both training groups (P <.001). The improvements in the training groups were similar; there were no changes in the untrained control group. These findings suggest that the symptomatic improvement after upper-limb exercise training may result, in part, from systemic cardiovascular effects rather than localized metabolic or hemodynamic changes.\nCarefully prescribed upper-limb exercise training can evoke a rapid symptomatic improvement in patients with claudication, while avoiding the physical discomfort experienced when performing lower-limb weight-bearing exercise.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent pneumatic foot compression (IPC(foot)) augments arterial leg inflow. It has been suggested that prolonged use of impulse leg compression at home might ameliorate claudication caused by peripheral vascular disease by improving collateral circulation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of IPC(foot) treatment on claudication distance and arterial hemodynamics in patients with intermittent claudication caused by peripheral vascular disease.\nThirty-seven patients with stable intermittent claudication were admitted to this prospective controlled study. Of these, 25 patients received IPC(foot) (>4 hr/d) for 4.5 months (group 1), and the other 12 patients acted as control patients (group 2). Both groups were advised to exercise unsupervised for a minimum of 1 hour daily and received aspirin (75 mg/d). Groups were matched for age, sex, risk factors, claudication distances, and ankle pressures at baseline. In each patient, initial claudication distance (ICD), absolute claudication distance (ACD), resting ankle brachial index (r-ABI), ankle brachial pressure index after exercise (p-eABI), and popliteal artery volume flow were measured at day 0, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, and 4.5 months. On completion of the treatment period (4.5 months), both groups continued with aspirin (75 mg/d) and unsupervised exercise and were re-examined after 12 months. Data analysis is based on nonparametric statistics, the Wilcoxon signed ranks test, and the Mann-Whitney test for intragroup and intergroup comparisons, respectively. Results are expressed as median and interquartile ranges.\nOver the 4.5 months of active treatment, (1) median ICD in group 1 increased by 146% (P <.001), from 78 m (interquartile range, 65-102 m) at baseline to 191.5 m (interquartile range, 127-254 m); ICD did not significantly increase in group 2; (2) median ACD in group 1 improved by 106% (P <.001), from 124 m (interquartile range, 100-160 m) to 255 m (interquartile range, 149-398 m); no significant changes were documented in group 2; (3) median r-ABI in group 1 rose by 18% (P <.001), from 0.57 (interquartile range, 0.48-0.62) to 0.67 (interquartile range, 0.64-0.70); no improvement was noted in group 2; (4) median p-eABI in group 1 rose by 110% (P <.001), from 0.21 (interquartile range, 0.07-0.27) to 0.44 (interquartile range, 0. 36-0.52); no changes were noted in group 2; and (5) median popliteal artery volume flow in group 1 improved by 36% (P <.001), from 100 mL/min (interquartile range, 59-163 mL/min) to 136 mL/min (interquartile range, 99.5-173.4 mL/min); no significant changes were found in group 2. At 4.5 months, ICD, ACD, r-ABI, and p-eABI in group 1 were all significantly better than those in group 2 (P <.01). Twelve months' posttreatment, walking ability and ABIs in group 1 were not statistically different from those at 4.5 months and remained significantly better than those of control subjects.\nIntermittent pneumatic foot compression used at home for 4.5 months increases claudication distance by over 100%. Associated increases in r-ABI by 18%, p-eABI by 110%, and arterial calf inflow by 36% suggest an improved collateral circulation. Maximum benefit seems to be offered over the initial 3 months.

    "abstract": "This prospective study aimed to validate a newly designed specific measure of quality of life for patients with venous ulcers.\nThe study was set in a London teaching hospital and surrounding community clinics. Items for the questionnaire were selected by means of patient interviews, a literature review, and expert opinion. The questionnaire and the Short Form 36-item (SF-36) Health Survey were given to a prospective consecutive cohort of 98 patients with proven venous ulcers that were diagnosed by means of clinical and color duplex examination. Fifty-eight of the patients were women (60%), and the median age of patients was 76 years. The questionnaire was assessed for reliability, validity, and responsiveness.\nThe ulcer-specific questionnaire showed good reliability, as assessed by means of the internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.93) and test-retest analysis (r = 0.84). Factor analysis identified four important health factors: social function, domestic activities, cosmesis, and emotional status. Validity was demonstrated by means of a high correlation with all eight domains of the SF-36 general health measure (r > 0.55, P <.001). Responsiveness was demonstrated by means of a significant reduction in the score on the ulcer questionnaire as ulcers healed at 6 and 11 weeks (P <.05).\nGood evidence exists that a clinically derived measure for patients with venous ulcers has validity to measure the quality of life.",

This study examines the pathophysiologic importance in select patients, describes treatment with surgery, and suggests a diagnostic tool.\nThirty severely symptomatic patients with venographic evidence of popliteal entrapment were selected to have popliteal vein release after a process of elimination (ie, other causes of chronic venous insufficiency [CVI] were ruled out by means of comprehensive hemodynamic and morphologic studies). In the last nine limbs, popliteal vein pressure was also measured by means of the introduction of a 2F transducer tip catheter. Patients were clinically and hemodynamically assessed before and after surgery, and anatomical anomalies encountered during surgery were recorded.\nPopliteal vein release was performed without mortality or serious morbidity. Anomalies of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle caused entrapment in 60% of the patients; anatomic course venous anomalies were infrequent (7% of the patients). Significant relief of pain and swelling occurred in the patients who had surgery. Stasis ulceration/dermatitis resolved in 82% of patients. Popliteal venous pressures had normalized in the six patients who were studied postoperatively.\nPopliteal vein entrapment should be included in the differential diagnosis of CVI in patients in whom other, more common etiologies have been excluded on the basis of comprehensive investigations. Popliteal vein compression can be demonstrated venographically in a large proportion of patients with CVI, but the lesion is likely pathological only in a small fraction of these patients. A technique for popliteal venous pressure measurement is described; it shows promise as a test for functional assessment of entrapment. Immediate results of popliteal vein release surgery are encouraging; long-term follow-up is necessary to judge the efficacy of surgical lysis of entrapment in symptomatic patients who fail to improve with conservative treatment measures.",

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) represents the preferred treatment for most upper ureteric and renal calculi. Complication rates associated with ESWL are low, justifying the enthusiasm and acceptance of this treatment modality. As the technique has become more widely available, some deleterious effects on the kidneys and the surrounding tissues are increasingly recognized. We report on the rupture of a severely calcified abdominal aorta in a 65-year-old man who underwent 3 months of ESWL treatment earlier for renal calculi. The patient was seen with an acute recrudescence of a long-standing abdominal and left flank pain, which began immediately after the last of the three sessions of ESWL and was associated with an episode of hypotension that occurred an hour before admission. Patient history and chronologic course of events strongly suggest the role of ESWL in the genesis of abdominal aorta rupture.",

We describe a patient who was treated with a new approach involving a single-stage operation without the need for median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass graft, or hypothermic arrest by resection of the tumor from the point of attachment in the abdominal portion of the inferior vena cava.",

When graft replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch and extra-anatomic bypass grafting were performed in a 72-year-old japanese woman with Takayasu's arteritis, which was complicated by aortic dissections localized in the ascending and abdominal aortae, the postoperative course of this patient was satisfactory. It was considered that the media became friable in this patient because of the presence of Takayasu's arteritis and that hypertension that persisted for a long time caused the independent development of aortic dissections in the ascending and abdominal aortae.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining hemodialysis access in the expanding number of patients with end-stage renal disease is a difficult and challenging problem. Published guidelines outline the initial recommendations for hemodialysis access; however, there is little consensus about the most appropriate options for the subset of patients with repeated access failures and/or unsuitable veins. Two case reports are presented describing the use of composite saphenous-superficial femoral vein autogenous accesses placed in the upper and lower extremities. The function of the autogenous accesses appeared to be similar to a mature arteriovenous fistula in the short-term, although further longitudinal studies are required. The superficial femoral vein may be a useful hemodialysis access conduit for patients with limited access options.",

    "abstract": "A 42-year-old man with a high-grade left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis demonstrated on a duplex scan was referred to us. A cerebral arteriogram confirmed a greater than 90% left internal carotid stenosis, but with the unexpected finding of a moderate amount of thrombus in the proximal ICA. He underwent emergent left carotid endarterectomy, but during the operation, only a small amount of thrombus was identified as adherent to the atherosclerotic plaque. he awakened in the operating room with a dense right hemiplegia and aphasia. Immediate reexploration demonstrated a patent endarterectomy site, a distal thromboembolectomy was performed without extraction of thrombus, and urokinase (250,000 Units) was infused into the distal ICA. He reawakened with an unchanged right hemiplegia and aphasia. The patient then underwent an urgent postoperative carotid and cerebral arteriogram that demonstrated an embolus to the middle cerebral artery. he was treated with the superselective infusion of urokinase (500,000 Units), with almost complete resolution of the clot. Over the course of the next 48 hours, the patient made a nearly complete neurologic recovery, and he was discharged from the hospital with only a slight facial droop. At 2 months' follow-up he was completely neurologically healthy. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of urokinase administered in the immediate postoperative period in the angiography suite to treat a thromboembolus complicating a carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "A familial component has previously been identified in 11% to 20% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The genetic basis of familial AAA remains elusive, however. Matrix metalloproteinases have been implicated in aneurysm development; and plasmin, a serine protease, activates metalloproteinases. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) regulates plasmin activation through the tissue plasminogen activators. A polymorphism within the promoter area of PAI-1 has been described that modifies PAI-1 expression and consequently plasminogen activation. The 4G homozygous variant is associated with increased PAI-1 expression and consequently reduced plasmin activity and therefore may be selected against in-familial AAA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of the 4G/5G insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter area of the PAI-1 gene in a population with AAA.\nPatients seen at a tertiary referral center for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms were recruited. DNA was extracted from blood. Primers were designed to amplify a 99 (5G)-base pair (bp) and a 98 (4G)-bp fragment bracketing the polymorphism. The 5' primer was mutated to allow a restriction endonuclease to cleave the 5G polymorphism into a 77-bp and a 22-bp fragment. Samples were run on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.\nOne hundred ninety patients with AAAs, including 39 patients with strong family histories and 163 controls were examined. The frequency of the 4G:5G alleles in the AAA population and in the control population was 0.6:0.4. However, 26% of patients with familial AAA were homozygous 5G compared with 13% of the control population. The 4G-allele frequency was 0.47 in the familial AAAs, compared with 0.62 in the nonfamilial patients (P =.02) and 0.61 in the control population (P =.03).\nThe selection against the 4G4G genotype in the familial AAA population may indicate a role for PAI in the development of AAA in this population.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to design an adequate technique with which to cryopreserve pig femoral arteries and to assess the influence of storage times in vascular function.\nFifty-two femoral arteries were distributed in seven groups. In group A (control), 10 arteries were studied after harvest; in groups B1 and B2, 19 arteries were suspended in RPMI 1640 plus fetal calf serum plus dimethylsulfoxide and were cryopreserved at 1 degrees C per minute or 0.3 degrees C per minute, respectively. In groups C1 to C4, 23 arteries were suspended in modified Krebs-Henseleit plus dimethylsulfoxide plus sucrose, cryopreserved at 0.7 degrees C per minute, and kept frozen for 1, 15, 60, or 180 days, respectively. After being thawed, arteries were examined for contraction and endothelial-dependent vasodilation (organ bath studies), antithrombotic properties of the endothelial layer(perfusion studies), and vessel structure (electron microscopy).\nEndothelial cells were present in both cryopreserved and control arteries. The control vessels showed a mean contraction to norepinephrine (10(-7) mol/L) of 13010 +/- 3181 mg. Arteries in groups B1 and B2 did not respond to norepinephrine. Contraction in groups C1 to C4 was as follows: C1, 5354 +/- 1222 mg; C2, 5187 +/- 2672 mg; C3, 6867 +/- 2292 mg; C4, 7000 +/- 2858 mg, which represent 50% of the control values (P <.001).

    "abstract": "Interposition of a vein cuff between a prosthetic infrainguinal bypass graft and a recipient infrageniculate artery can improve graft patency. There is evidence that the improved performance may be explained by a redistribution of myointimal hyperplasia (MIH) away from the critical areas at the heel and toe of the cuff-artery anastomosis. It is widely accepted that there is an association between hemodynamic forces, more specifically, low wall shear stress (WSS), and the development of MIH. The aim of this study was to determine whether the reported redistribution of MIH in the interposition vein cuff (IVC) may be explained by differences in magnitude and distribution of WSS. Design of Study and Method: Detailed flow velocity measurements were made in life-size models of conventional end-to-side (ETS) and IVC anastomoses using a two-component laser Doppler anemometer under pulsatile flow conditions. Velocity vectors were determined in the plane of symmetry of the anastomosis, and the variation of WSS was estimated from near-wall velocity measurements on the floor and upper wall of the artery.\nThe main flow features in the ETS anastomosis were flow separation at the graft hood, strong radial velocity at the heel, and a stagnation point on the floor of the artery that moved slightly during the flow cycle. In the IVC anastomosis, a coherent vortex that occupied most of the cuff volume was present from the systolic deceleration phase to end diastole. A stagnation point on the anastomosis floor was found to oscillate by about 4 mm. Critical regions of low mean WSS (ie, below 0.5 N/m(2)) were identified. In the ETS anastomosis, they were found at the heel and along the floor. In the IVC anastomosis, low mean WSS was found only on the floor, and it was generally less extensive than in the ETS anastomosis.\nThe vein cuff anastomosis alters the mean WSS distribution within the recipient artery and removes the area of low WSS at the heel. This may explain the redistribution of MIH away from important sites in the recipient artery.",

The lactulose mannitol test (L/M test) was performed in patients with intermittent claudication to evaluate the change in intestinal permeability when they were forced to walk.\nThe L/M test was performed in 11 patients with intermittent claudication and 11 control subjects without intermittent claudication. The test was performed at rest and after exercise. Patients walked on a treadmill until they stopped because of pain. The control subjects were forced to walk as far as 200 m on a treadmill. The L/M test was repeated in the patients after successful arterial reconstruction. Then the patients were instructed to walk the same distance at the same speed as they had before surgery.\nIn patients, the mean L/M ratio after exercise was significantly higher than the mean L/M ratio when they were at rest (0.068 +/- 0.053 vs 0.022 +/- 0.009, P <.05). In control subjects, however, no significant difference was observed between the mean L/M ratios after exercise and at rest.

However, repopulation by endothelial cells has not previously been demonstrated or characterized in human subjects.\nIn our prospective trial, 40 patients (20 men, 20 women) underwent cryo- preserved saphenous vein bypass grafting procedures for limb salvage. Several patients underwent multiple grafting procedures. All grafts were sampled at implantation. During the 31 month follow-up interval, 22 allografts were explanted at the time of revision or subsequent surgical procedure. All grafts (22 of 22) demonstrated intact endothelium at implantation and explantation. Seventeen explantation biopsy samples (seven from men, 10 from women) from 16 patients (seven men, nine women) were adequate for further histologic and immunofluorescent analysis. Explants were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical markers to quantitate rejection and also underwent fluorescence in-situ hybridization, with probes for X and Y chromosomes and counterstain for nuclear envelope. Cells were counted as XX, XY, XO, YO, or unstained. The endothelium and vessel walls were analyzed for origin of cells based on sex-mismatched transplants, with sex-matched transplants serving as controls.\nEvidence of cellular damage was noted in all explanted allografts, and moderate or severe rejection (lymphocyte infiltrate, +CD3, +CD8, +CR3, cytotoxic granules) was noted in six explanted allografts (29%). All allografts demonstrated intact endothelium (complete or partial), at the time of both implantation and explantation. Sex-matched (male to male) control explants showed only male cells, as expected. Male donor-female recipient transplants showed complete repopulation by recipient (female) cells in nine of 10 cases (90%), whereas one case (10%) demonstrated partial repopulation (a mosaic of male and female cells). One patient's slides were unreadable. Findings in cells of the allograft wall were identical to those of the endothelium (nine recipient-only cells and one mosaic). Complete absence of donor cells was noted as early as 1 week after implantation, but mosaicism was demonstrated in one patient 3 months after grafting. No relationship could be demonstrated between repopulation and time (P >.05), quantity of rejection (P >.05), or donor age (P >.05).\nBoth the endothelial lining and vessel wall of venous allografts repopulate with cells of recipient origin, resulting in either a completely novel cellular constituency or a mosaic of host and donor cells. The loss of donor cells may be mediated by apoptosis or rejection, and the rate of migration of repopulating host cells is, at this point, unclear. Although the development of a completely endothelial-lined conduit offers a potential advantage over other alternative conduits, the functional status of the neoendothelium and repopulated vessel wall and their role in maintenance of allograft patency require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "In the presence of carotid occlusion, the external carotid artery (ECA) becomes an important source of cerebral blood flow, especially if the circle of Willis is incomplete. The contribution of the ECA to hemispheric blood flow in patients with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis has never been previously investigated.\nOne hundred eight patients were monitored during sequential cross-clamping of the external (ECA) and then ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) during carotid endarterectomy using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) (Neuroguard CDS, Los Angeles, Calif), to measure middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, and near-infrared spectroscopy, to measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation (CsO(2)) (Invos 3100A; Somanetics, Troy, Mich).\nOn the ipsilateral ECA cross-clamp, the median fall in CsO(2) was 3% (interquartile range, 1%-4%; P <.0001). On addition of the ICA cross-clamp there was a further fall of 3% and a total fall of 6% (3%-9%; P <.0001). The median percentage fall in middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity on ECA clamping was 12% (4%-24%; P <.0001); on ICA clamping it was 48% (25%-74%; P <.0001). Falls in TCD on ECA clamping were greater with increasing severity of ipsilateral ICA stenosis. The correlation between CsO(2) and TCD on external clamping, although less strong than that on internal clamping, was statistically significant r = 0.32; P =.01; Spearman rank correlation).\nThe falls in TCD and CsO(2) were of a similar order of magnitude and must therefore reflect a fall in cerebral perfusion. The ipsilateral ECA contributes significantly to intracranial blood flow and oxygen saturation in severe carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes the course of 48 patients with 49 chronic carotid dissections (who were treated surgically at our institution after a median anticoagulation period of 9 months because of a persistent high-grade stenosis or an aneurysm) and the course of one additional patient with acute carotid dissection (who underwent early operative reconstruction 12 hours after onset because of fluctuating neurologic symptoms).\nAll medical and surgical records and imaging studies were reviewed retrospectively. All histologic specimens were reevaluated by a single pathologist to assess the cause of dissection. Follow-up of 41 patients (85%) after 70 months (range, 1-190 months) consisted of an examination of the extracranial vessels in the neck by Doppler ultrasound scanning and a questionnaire about the patients' medical history and their personal appraisals of cranial nerve function.\nSeventy percent of the dissections had developed spontaneously; 18% were caused by trauma; 12% of all patients (22% of the women) had a fibromuscular dysplasia. Indication for surgery was a high-grade persisting stenosis and a persisting or newly developed aneurysm. Flow restoration was achieved by resection and vein graft replacement in 40 cases (80%) and thromboendarterectomy and patch angioplasty in three cases (6%). Gradual dilatation was performed and effective in two cases (4%). Five internal carotid arteries (10%) had to be clipped because dissection extended into the skull base. One patient died of intracranial bleeding. Five patients (10%) experienced the development of a recurrent minor stroke (ipsilateral, 4 patients; contralateral, 1 patient). Cranial nerve damage could not be avoided in 29 cases (58%) but were transient in most of the cases. During follow-up, one patient died of unrelated reasons, and only one patient had experienced the development of a neurologic event of unknown cause.\nChronic carotid dissection can be effectively treated by surgical reconstruction to prevent further ischemic or thromboembolic complications, if medical treatment for 6 months with anticoagulation failed or if carotid aneurysms and/or high-grade carotid stenosis persisted or have newly developed.",

    "abstract": "We assessed whether the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) task force guidelines for perioperative cardiac evaluation could reliably stratify cardiac risk before aortic surgery.\nWe retrospectively applied the guidelines to a closed database, set up prospectively. The setting was a referral center in an institutional practice with hospitalized patients. The closed database included 133 patients who had a routine cardiac examination, which comprised an estimation of functional capacity and noninvasive testing, before aortic surgery. This cardiac evaluation led to the proposal of coronarography in 23 patients and to treating an underlying coronary artery disease in 21 patients (including three myocardial revascularizations). One patient died after myocardial revascularization, and two patients died of cardiac causes after aortic surgery. The algorithm of the ACC/AHA guidelines was applied independently by two investigators to each patient's file that was included in the existing database. The main outcome measure was a comparison between cardiac risk stratification with the ACC/AHA guidelines and the results of the routine cardiac evaluation.\nThe ACC/AHA guidelines were successfully applied to all 133 files by the two investigators. After applying the algorithm, 73 patients were stratified as low cardiac risk, and 60 patients were stratified as high risk. The 21 patients who had undergone a preoperative coronary artery disease optimization were stratified as high risk by means of the ACC/AHA guidelines. The patients who died from cardiac causes were stratified as high risk by means of the ACC/AHA guidelines, whereas none of the patients stratified as low risk died during hospitalization.\nThe ACC/AHA guidelines were effective in stratifying cardiac risk by using clinical predictors and an estimate of the physical capacity of the patient. Their use may allow a reduction in unnecessary noninvasive testing in patients stratified as being at low risk, while permitting the selection of all patients likely to benefit from preoperative coronary artery disease optimization.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harvested from implanted synthetic grafts demonstrate increased production of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) but decreased proliferative response compared with aortic SMCs. The purpose of this study was to determine the migratory response of graft versus aortic SMCs.\nThoracoabdominal grafts were implanted in beagles. The SMCs were harvested from the graft and infrarenal aorta. Migration was determined with the use of a razor-scrape assay and computerized image analysis.\nThe mean distance migrated and the number of cells that migrated were greater in graft SMCs at baseline (185 +/- 18 micrometer and 108 +/- 17 cells) compared with aortic cells (110 +/- 10 micrometer and 42 +/- 5 cells)(P <.05). Baseline differences persisted after treatment with antibodies to PDGF. The addition of PDGF (10 ng/mL) resulted in increased migration in both graft (229 +/- 23 micrometer and 146 +/- 20 cells) and aortic SMCs (130 +/- 9 micrometer and 70 +/- 5 cells) compared with baseline (P <.05). The relative increase in response to PDGF was similar between the two groups (P = not significant).\nGraft SMCs differ phenotypically from aortic SMCs; they exhibit increased basal migration that is independent of autocrine stimulation by PDGF. In contrast to their blunted proliferative response, graft SMCs have a similar migratory response to PDGF compared with aortic SMCs.",

    "abstract": "Decreased oxygen supply is generally accepted as the primary cause of muscle dysfunction in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and intermittent claudication, although reported morphologic changes in the mitochondria of claudicating muscle suggest that impaired energy utilization may also play a role. With the measurement of the phosphate-rich compounds of muscle energy metabolism (adenosinetriphosphate [ATP], adenosinediphosphate [ADP], and phosphocreatine [PCr]) and pH, phosphorus P 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P MRS) provides a unique, noninvasive method to investigate this hypothesis further.\nCalf muscle bioenergetics were studied in 12 men with moderate claudication (ankle-brachial index >/=0.5 and </=0.8) and 14 normal control subjects with the use of (31)P MRS and standard treadmill testing. Phosphorus MRS evaluation of the superficial posterior calf muscles was carried out with a 90-second submaximal isometric plantar flexion exercise. This mild exercise was chosen to permit in-magnet testing and to allow study of intrinsic mitochondrial efficiency under conditions of unchallenged blood flow. Phosphocreatine and ADP recovery time constants (t.c.), two very sensitive measures of oxidative mitochondrial function, as well as intracellular pH and ATP production via anaerobic glycolysis were determined during three exercise sessions and the results averaged and compared to known values obtained from a control population.\nDuring the (31)P MRS protocol, the end exercise intracellular pH (7.11 +/- 0.01 vs 7.11 +/- 0.01) and ATP production by anaerobic glycolysis (0.13 +/- 0.05 vs 0.14 +/- 0.03 mmol/L per second) were no different in PAOD patients versus control subjects, confirming that the protocol exercise did not significantly reduce oxygen supply. Phosphocreatine and ADP recovery t.c. (137 +/- 41 vs 44 +/- 3 seconds and 60 +/- 10 vs 29 +/- 2 seconds, respectively) were significantly slower than normal (P <.05, t test). There was, however, no correlation between these measures of mitochondrial function and any treadmill parameter (P >.5, Pearson moment correlation).\nPhosphorus 31 MRS provides the first direct evidence of defective energy metabolism in the mitochondria of claudicating calf muscle. This defect appears to be independent of both arterial flow and the severity of occlusive disease in patients with mild to moderate claudication. Coupled with documented ultrastructural and DNA abnormalities in the mitochondria of claudicating skeletal muscle, these data provide evidence for a secondary cause of muscle dysfunction in intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "Fibrin glue (FG) has been used for local cytokine delivery on both vascular grafts and angioplasty sites. We measured the diffusive release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and heparin from FG and the mitogenic activity of VEGF with and without heparin in FG on canine endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nRelease of VEGF labeled with iodine 125 and tritiated heparin from FG into the overlying media was serially measured over 96 hours, and the data are reported as the mean percent released +/- SD. Proliferation assays measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation were performed for ECs and SMCs plated in media with 10% serum on FG containing various concentrations of VEGF and heparin. Media was placed on the FG for 24 hours and removed before plating cells to minimize the effect of the released, soluble VEGF and heparin.\nAt 24 hours, 54% +/- 1% and 58% +/- 1% of the radioactive VEGF and heparin were released, respectively, with minimal release thereafter (58% +/- 1% and 66% +/- 1% at 96 hours). The ECs, SMCs, or media only (no cells) was plated on FG containing radioactive VEGF in an immediate or 24-hour delayed fashion for 72 hours to determine the percent release of VEGF into the media with the two different methods of plating. Cell type and the presence or absence of cells did not affect VEGF release, but there was three times more VEGF in the media for the immediate versus delayed plating (P <.001). Without heparin, VEGF at 100 ng/mL or more in the FG was needed to induce EC proliferation. Heparin at 5 U/mL enhanced EC proliferation at the VEGF dose of 100 ng/mL as compared wtih no heparin (P <.001), but not at the VEGF dose of 1000 ng/mL, which likely represents a maximal response. With heparin at 500 U/mL, the ECs died. In contrast, VEGF, in the presence or absence of heparin, did not affect SMC proliferation.\nWe conclude that FG with VEGF at 1000 ng/mL and heparin at 5 U/mL is the optimal concentration for in vivo use because this may encourage EC, but not SMC, proliferation. The VEGF at 1000 ng/mL should leave mitogenic concentrations of VEGF intact after the initial, diffusive loss, and the addition of heparin at 5 U/mL may enhance VEGF mitogenic activity.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to be of clear benefit to selected patients. However, recent trials of carotid endarterectomy versus best medical therapy have excluded octogenarians, and some authors have suggested that carotid endarterectomy would have an unfavorable cost-benefit relationship in octogenarians. We compared patients and results for carotid endarterectomy in octogenarians and younger patients.\nWe reviewed the results for 582 primary carotid endarterectomies (90 in octogenarians and 492 in younger patients) performed in 528 patients between February 1, 1985, and January 31, 1998 (all data were collected prospectively for the most recent 301 carotid endarterectomies). Conventional surgical technique was used with general anesthesia, selective shunting, and selective patching. Main outcome measures were perioperative and late ipsilateral stroke and death.\nThe two groups were similar with respect to indications for carotid endarterectomy and patient characteristics, except that octogenarians were more likely to have histories of congestive heart failure or hypertension and less likely to have histories of smoking or chronic lung disease. Carotid endarterectomy was performed for asymptomatic disease in 27% of the octogenarians and 33% of the younger patients (P =.31). Stenosis was >/=80% in 90% of the octogenarians and 78% of the younger patients (P =.014). Perioperative strokes, all of which were ipsilateral, occurred in one octogenarian (1.1%) and eight younger patients (1.6%, P = 1.00). No octogenarians and two younger patients died within 30 days of surgery (P = 1.00). Length of stay and direct costs associated with carotid endarterectomy were similar for octogenarians and younger patients. Late strokes occurred in two octogenarians (one ipsilateral) and four younger patients (two ipsilateral). Life table estimates of freedom from ipsilateral stroke at 2 years were 98% and 97% for octogenarians and younger patients, respectively (log-rank P =.69), and life table estimates of patient survival at 4 years were 81% and 89% for octogenarians and younger patients, respectively (P =.11). Octogenarians represented an increasing fraction of the carotid endarterectomies performed during the study period.\nOctogenarians selected for carotid endarterectomy were similar to younger patients with respect to indications for carotid endarterectomy and comorbidities. Early mortality, early and late neurologic outcome, complications, and resource utilization were similar for the two groups, and more than 75% of octogenarians survived 4 years after undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Cost-benefit analyses for carotid endarterectomy, which are highly sensitive to expected patient survival, might not be pertinent to individual patient situations. Intellectually intact octogenarians without unusually severe comorbidities are good candidates for and should be offered the benefits of carotid endarterectomy.",

Voluntary participation was solicited in a standardized program of ongoing hospital-based data collection of CEA process and outcome data.\nThe statewide combined stroke or mortality rate decreased from 7.8% in 1994 to 4.0% in the 1995 to 1996 time period (P <.001). Fourteen hospitals, accounting for 74% of the statewide cases, participated in ongoing data collection.

    "abstract": "Conduit size and quality are major determinants of the long-term success of infrainguinal autologous vein grafting. However, accurate measurement of the internal diameter of vein grafts is difficult given their variable wall thickness and taper. The purpose of this study was to define the \"effective\" internal diameter of a vein graft according to its hemodynamic properties and to determine its significance for graft patency.\nSixty infrainguinal bypass grafts performed on 57 patients were evaluated intraoperatively. Proximal and distal graft pressure and blood flow (Q(meas)) were measured with fluid-filled catheter transduction and ultrasonic transit-time flowimetry, respectively, after unclamping. Waveforms were recorded digitally at 200 Hz under baseline conditions and after stimulation with 60 mg of papaverine. According to Fourier transformation of the measured pressure gradient (DeltaP), the Womersley solution for fluid flow in a straight rigid tube was used to calculate theoretical flow waveforms (Q(calc)) for a range of graft diameters. The theoretical waveforms were then compared with the measured flow waveforms and the best-fit diameter chosen as the \"effective hemodynamic diameter\" (EHD). Only grafts in which the correlation coefficient of Q(calc) versus Q(meas) was more than 0.90 were accepted (n = 47) to assure validity of the hemodynamic model. After a mean follow-up of 12.5 months (range, 0.1-43.9 months), patency was determined by the life table method. Hemodynamic and clinical variables were tabulated, and their effect on patency determined the use of univariate and multivariate Cox regression.\nMean EHD was 4.1 +/- 0.1 mm with a range of 2.5 to 5.7 mm. Administration of papaverine caused profound changes in DeltaP (+78% +/- 17%) and Q(meas) (+71% +/- 12%) as expected, but had no effect on EHD (+0.05% +/- 0.1%). Univariate regression identified five variables associated with decreased secondary patency (P <.10): low EHD, conduit source other than the greater saphenous vein, high baseline DeltaP(mean), female sex, and redo operation. Of these, only low EHD was significant after multivariate analysis (P =.03). Patency of small diameter grafts (EHD < 3.6 mm; n = 11) was compared with patency of larger grafts (EHD > 3.6 mm; n = 36) to test a frequently espoused clinical guideline. Grafts with an EHD less than 3.6 mm exhibited significantly lower secondary patency compared with larger grafts (P =.0001). The positive and negative predictive values for an EHD less than 3.6 mm for secondary graft failure for grafts with at least 1 year follow-up were 86% and 88%, respectively.\nAn EHD is a unique parameter that quantifies conduit size and has a significant impact on vein graft patency. An EHD less than 3.6 mm portends graft failure.",

Univariate regression identified five variables associated with decreased secondary patency (P <.10): low EHD, conduit source other than the greater saphenous vein, high baseline DeltaP(mean), female sex, and redo operation. Of these, only low EHD was significant after multivariate analysis (P =.03). Patency of small diameter grafts (EHD < 3.6 mm; n = 11) was compared with patency of larger grafts (EHD > 3.6 mm; n = 36) to test a frequently espoused clinical guideline. Grafts with an EHD less than 3.6 mm exhibited significantly lower secondary patency compared with larger grafts (P =.0001). The positive and negative predictive values for an EHD less than 3.6 mm for secondary graft failure for grafts with at least 1 year follow-up were 86% and 88%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Recent increases in the rate of carotid endarterectomies (CEAs) have been attributed to results of clinical trials demonstrating efficacy when CEA is performed in centers of excellence. Subsequent population-based data suggest that trial results may not be matched in the community. This study was undertaken to characterize trends in CEA procedure rates after the dissemination of trial data and to describe any change in patient outcomes with population-based data from a single state.\nHospital administrative data on CEAs from 1992 to 1996 (n = 45,744) were obtained for the state of Florida. Annualized CEA rates per 100, 000 Florida residents were analyzed to determine trends in patient age, sex, admission type, size of hospital beds, ownership type and teaching status, and annual hospital and surgeon CEA volume. Outcomes were examined to track trends in complication rates.\nThe annual number of CEA procedures increased 74% from 63.7 per 100,000 residents per year to 110.8 per 100,000 residents per year between 1992 and 1996. A single large increase occurred during the second half of 1994 when CEAs increased 73.5% from 16.6 per 100, 000 residents per quarter to 28.8 per 100,000 residents per quarter after a clinical alert on benefits to CEAs in asymptomatic patients. Over 5 years, there were significant trends toward more nonemergent admissions, and more procedures were performed in high-volume hospitals and by high-volume surgeons. Procedure rates in both women and very elderly patients increased more than 70%, which was in step with younger patients and men. The incidence of inpatient stroke and death declined over the 5-year period, whereas the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction remained constant.\nExperience from Florida indicates that CEA rates increased as results of the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Study disseminated. Trial results have been broadly interpreted to include women and very elderly patients. More patients are being referred to busier hospitals and to high-volume surgeons, which should continue to result in better patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis, treatment, and long-term sequelae of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) depend on the anatomic location and extent of the process, yet a lack of such fundamental knowledge has limited the development of effective protocols for managing patients with DVT.\nVenograms with evidence of acute DVT were evaluated, and the extent of the thrombotic process was recorded and correlated with the clinical presentation. Thrombi were classified according to the venous segments involved and to the thrombus' isolation to one segment or multiple segments. The left-to-right ratio of the DVT was assessed for various etiologic subgroups.\nAmong 2762 venograms performed in 2541 patients over a 10-year period, there were 885 cases (34.8%) of DVT documented. Of these cases, 344 cases (39%) were idiopathic, 307 cases (35%) were postoperative, 84 cases (10%) occurred in the setting of malignancy, and 70 cases (8%) occurred as the result of trauma. Distal thrombi were more common than proximal thrombi, with calf involvement in 734 patients (83%), femoropopliteal involvement in 470 patients (53%), and iliac involvement in 75 patients (9%). The most common site of thrombus was the peroneal vein, which was involved in 595 patients (67%). The ratio of left-to-right-sided DVT was 1.32:1 overall but was greater for proximal thrombi, with a ratio of 2.4:1 for iliac DVT versus 1.3:1 for infrainguinal DVT. The preponderance of left-sided DVT appeared to be related to the high-frequency, left common iliac vein involvement; the left-to-right ratio was much closer to equality (1.09:1) for isolated infrainguinal DVT. The anatomic configuration of the DVT was correlated with the etiologic subgroup; postoperative DVTs were more often distal, whereas DVT developing in the setting of malignancy was more frequently proximal and often right sided. Proximal, left-sided DVTs were common in the idiopathic subgroup, presumably as a result of undiagnosed left iliac vein webs.\nThe frequency of distal vein involvement greatly exceeds that of proximal involvement in patients with DVTs. Proximal DVTs are more frequently left sided, whereas distal DVTs occur with a more equal left-to-right distribution. The anatomic extent of DVTs appears to depend on the etiology of the process. These observations may shed light on the pathophysiology of venous thrombosis. The findings are of value in planning therapeutic interventions directed at venous recanalization.",

    "abstract": "Placement of intraluminal stents in the common iliac artery (CIA) and external iliac artery (EIA) has become an accepted therapy for treating localized arterial stenoses. The purpose of this study was to compare anatomic patency rates of stents placed in the EIA and CIA for occlusive disease.\nA radiologic computer database was used to identify 69 consecutive male patients at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center from February 1, 1993, through January 31, 1999, who underwent placement of 98 stents (82 Wallstents and 16 Palmaz stents) for physiologically significant iliac artery occlusive disease and varying degrees of chronic limb ischemia. Patients were followed up with surveillance duplex ultrasound scanning examinations 1 day after procedure, 3 months after procedure, and then at 6-month intervals after stent placement. Follow-up angiograms were performed for patients with duplex ultrasound scans that revealed velocities greater than 300 cm/s. Patient risk factors, iliac artery runoff, concomitant outflow procedures, and anatomic patency rates were compared between patients receiving EIA stents and those receiving CIA stents.\nThe mean age for the EIA stent group was 69 +/- 1 years versus 66 +/- 1 years (P =.03) for the CIA stent group. Mean follow-up was 21.4 +/- 2.1 months (+/- SE) for all patients. Patients with EIA stents had more ischemic lower limbs when compared with patients who had CIA stents (P =.05). No differences were found between groups in risk factor analysis (P = not significant). Lesion lengths were similar between groups: EIA, 4.6 +/- 0.6 cm, and CIA, 5. 3 +/- 0.8 cm (P = not significant). The following differences were noted on primary patency rates (EIA group vs CIA group): 1 year (93% vs 88%), 2 years (91% vs 85%), and 3 years (90% vs 78%) (Cox proportional hazards; P =.13).\nAnatomic patency rates for EIA and CIA stents appear to be similar despite the fact that patients with EIA stents were older and had more ischemic limbs compared with the patients who had CIA stents.",

    "abstract": "Anatomic patency after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries does not guarantee clinical success. The aim of this report is to determine the causes of clinical failure after PTA.\nThe records of all patients who have undergone PTA of the femoropopliteal arterial segment by our vascular group were retrospectively reviewed. Only patients with complete records and at least one postprocedure clinical and anatomic assessment within the same 30-day time interval were included. Success was defined according to the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Reporting Standards for Endovascular Procedures. Anatomic cumulative patency and clinical success were calculated according to life table analysis on an intent-to-treat basis.\nWe identified 85 patients who met inclusion criteria. We treated 112 lesions with an average stenosis of 80% +/- 16% and lesion length of 2.3 +/- 1.8 cm. Technical failure occurred in six (5.4%) of 112 lesions. Cumulative clinical success was 69% at 1 year, 54% at 2 years, 49% at 3 years, and 40% at 4 years. Anatomic patency was 74% at 1 year, 62% at 2 years, 57% at 3 years, and 52% at 4 years. There were 45 clinical failures; of these, twenty-seven (60%) occurred in conjunction with anatomic failure. Anatomic failure was due to restenosis in 12 patients (44%), occlusion in eight patients (30%), and restenosis with progression of disease in six patients (22%). Anatomic failure at the time of the procedure occurred in one patient (4%). Clinical failure occurred despite anatomic patency in the remaining 18 patients (40%). Etiology for clinical failure in this latter group included progression of disease within the treated vessel in 12 patients (67%), iliac disease in three patients (17%), tibial disease in two patients (11%), and bypass graft failure in one patient (5%). Fifty percent of all 45 clinical failures were successfully treated with supplemental percutaneous procedures.\nA PTA is an acceptable therapeutic option for the treatment of focal occlusive disease of the femoropopliteal arterial segment. Most clinical failures were due to anatomic failure, but a significant number occurred despite patency at the PTA site. Although primary clinical success rates were inferior to surgical bypass graft, supplemental PTA was possible in 50% of patients. Repeat percutaneous treatment may extend the interval of clinical success and may obviate the need for surgical bypass graft.",

    "abstract": "Many new patients evaluated by vascular surgeons are referred by internal medicine physicians (IMPs). Objectives shared by vascular surgeons and IMPs include early identification of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), improved referral relationships, and reduction of health care costs. The approach to PAD by IMPs and identification of deficiencies that might contribute to suboptimal care form the basis for this report.\nAn anonymous survey was mailed to all IMPs (n = 843) in the central and southern parts of Illinois. Questions concerned IMP demographics, approach to diagnostic testing, referral patterns, perception of adequacy of education of PAD, and how often parts of the history and physical examination for PAD would be performed on the initial office visit of a hypothetical 65-year-old male with hypertension (each answer measured as 0%-25%, 25%-50%, 50%-75%, and 75%-100% of the time completed).\nThere was a response from 360 IMPs: 230 IMPs (27.3%) returned the questionnaire, and 130 IMPs (15.4%) declined to participate. Practice locations for IMPs returning the questionnaire included rural (36%), suburban (22%), and urban (40%). Practice types included academic (7%), solo private (29%), group private (53%), and other (14%). A history of cardiac disease was obtained most of the time by 92% of IMPs (75%-100% answer category). Histories for pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and smoking were obtained most of the time with similar frequencies (85%, 86%, 73%, and 96%, respectively). In contrast, only 37% obtained a history for claudication, and 26% obtained a history for foot ulceration 75% to 100% of the time (P <.05, all comparisons). Examination of the heart (95%) and lungs (96%) occurred most of the time (75%-100% answer category) compared with each part of the pulse examination (range, 34%-60%; P <.05, all comparisons) and aortic aneurysm palpation (39%; P <.05). If pedal pulses were absent, examination by IMPs with Doppler scan and ankle-arm indices were mostly distributed in the 0% to 25% answer category (79% and 79%, respectively). After suspecting PAD, most IMPs obtained diagnostic tests first compared with specialist referral: carotid disease (91% vs 9%), aortic aneurysm (91% vs 9%), and lower extremity PAD (86% vs 14%). Initial referral patterns were made to vascular surgeons (49%), general surgeons (33%), cardiothoracic surgeons (13%), cardiologists (4%), and radiologists (1%). Most IMPs believed medical school (70%) and residency (73%) provided adequate training for PAD diagnosis.\nDeficiencies may exist in the identification of PAD by IMPs that could adversely affect diagnosis, time to referral, health care costs, and ultimately, patient outcome. Improvements in medical school education and IMP training in the diagnosis of PAD are needed.",

Practice locations for IMPs returning the questionnaire included rural (36%), suburban (22%), and urban (40%). Practice types included academic (7%), solo private (29%), group private (53%), and other (14%). A history of cardiac disease was obtained most of the time by 92% of IMPs (75%-100% answer category). Histories for pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and smoking were obtained most of the time with similar frequencies (85%, 86%, 73%, and 96%, respectively). In contrast, only 37% obtained a history for claudication, and 26% obtained a history for foot ulceration 75% to 100% of the time (P <.05, all comparisons). Examination of the heart (95%) and lungs (96%) occurred most of the time (75%-100% answer category) compared with each part of the pulse examination (range, 34%-60%; P <.05, all comparisons) and aortic aneurysm palpation (39%; P <.05). If pedal pulses were absent, examination by IMPs with Doppler scan and ankle-arm indices were mostly distributed in the 0% to 25% answer category (79% and 79%, respectively). After suspecting PAD, most IMPs obtained diagnostic tests first compared with specialist referral: carotid disease (91% vs 9%), aortic aneurysm (91% vs 9%), and lower extremity PAD (86% vs 14%). Initial referral patterns were made to vascular surgeons (49%), general surgeons (33%), cardiothoracic surgeons (13%), cardiologists (4%), and radiologists (1%). Most IMPs believed medical school (70%) and residency (73%) provided adequate training for PAD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to review our experience with surgical repair of lower thoracoabdominal and suprarenal aortic aneurysms to determine early and late survival rates and identify factors influencing morbidity and survival among these patients.\nFrom 1989 through 1998, 165 consecutive patients underwent repair of 108 thoracoabdominal (55 group III and 53 group IV) and 57 suprarenal aneurysms. The study group consisted of 109 men and 56 women with a mean age of 70 years (median, 70 years; range, 29-89 years). Mean aneurysm diameter was 6.9 cm (median, 6.5 cm; range, 4-12 cm). There were 125 aneurysms (76%) repaired electively; 40 repairs (24%) were nonelective. The cause of 12 aneurysms (7%) was chronic aortic dissection; the remaining 153 (93%) were degenerative aneurysms.\nThe early postoperative (30-day) mortality rates were 7% (9/125) for elective and 23% (9/40) for nonelective operations (P =.016). For both elective and urgent procedures, early mortality was 1.8% (1/57) for suprarenal aneurysm repair, 11% (6/53) for group IV thoracoabdominal aneurysms, and 20% (11/55) for group III thoracoabdominal aneurysms (P =.013, suprarenal vs group III). Spinal cord ischemia occurred after 6% (10/165) of aneurysm repairs (4% paraplegia, 2% paraparesis). None of the 57 suprarenal aneurysm repairs were complicated by spinal cord ischemia, whereas it occurred in 2% (1/53) of group IV thoracoabdominal aneurysms and 16% (9/55) of group III thoracoabdominal aneurysms (P =.001, suprarenal vs group III; P =. 016, group IV vs group III). Three (25%) of the 12 patients with dissection developed spinal cord ischemia; this compared with seven (5%) of 153 patients with degenerative aneurysms (P =.027). The cumulative 3-year survival rate for the entire series was 71% (95% CI, 64%-79%), and 5-year survival was 50% (95% CI, 40%-60%).\nAneurysms involving the suprarenal, visceral, and lower thoracic aorta may be repaired with acceptable perioperative mortality and late survival rates. The risk of spinal cord ischemia is increased for patients with aortic dissection and may be stratified according to the proximal extent of the aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Some measure of disease severity is needed to properly compare the outcomes of the various approaches to the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. Comparing the outcomes of two or more different treatments in a clinical trial, or the same treatment in two or more reports from the literature cannot be done with confidence unless the relative severity of the venous disease in each treatment group is known. The CEAP (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomic-Pathophysiologic) system is an excellent classification scheme, but it cannot serve the purpose of venous severity scoring because many of its components are relatively static and others use detailed alphabetical designations. A disease severity scoring scheme needs to be quantifiable, with gradable elements that can change in response to treatment. However, an American Venous Forum committee on venous outcomes assessment has developed a venous severity scoring system based on the best usable elements of the CEAP system. Two scores are proposed. The first is a Venous Clinical Severity Score: nine clinical characteristics of chronic venous disease are graded from 0 to 3 (absent, mild, moderate, severe) with specific criteria to avoid overlap or arbitrary scoring. Zero to three points are added for differences in background conservative therapy (compression and elevation) to produce a 30 point-maximum flat scale. The second is a Venous Segmental Disease Score, which combines the Anatomic and Pathophysiologic components of CEAP. Major venous segments are graded according to presence of reflux and/or obstruction. It is entirely based on venous imaging, primarily duplex scan but also phlebographic findings. This scoring scheme weights 11 venous segments for their relative importance when involved with reflux and/or obstruction, with a maximum score of 10. A third score is simply a modification of the existing CEAP disability score that eliminates reference to work and an 8-hour working day, substituting instead the patient's prior normal activities. These new scoring schemes are intended to complement the current CEAP system.",

We present a case of long-term ergot use for migraine headaches in a woman who had severe chronic lower extremity claudication. This case demonstrates the unique features associated with the diagnosis and management of chronic ergot toxicity. We recommend a conservative approach consisting of observation, antiplatelet agents, and the discontinuance of ergots.

    "abstract": "A 74-year-old man receiving long-term anticoagulation therapy for intermittent atrial fibrillation had a type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. During an 8-month follow-up, the endoleak persisted, and the aneurysm failed to decrease in diameter. By means of a left flank retroperitoneal endoscopic surgical approach, the aneurysm was dissected free, and the lumbar arteries emanating from the aneurysm, as well as the inferior mesenteric artery, were ligated with titanium clips. A postoperative spiral computed tomography scan depicted one pair of unclipped lumbar arteries just proximal to the aortic bifurcation. After immediate reoperation with the same approach, complete thrombosis of the aneurysm sac was radiographically confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Artery-wall hypoxia has been proposed to contribute to many kinds of artery-wall pathologic conditions, including atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia. Intimal hyperplasia is common at sites of arterial injury, including an anastomosis.

    "abstract": "Overexpression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene inhibits neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanism by which nitric oxide (NO) inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, specifically focusing on signaling pathways known to be activated by NO, including cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), p53, and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).\nVSMCs that were subjected to iNOS gene transfer demonstrated a reduction in proliferation (80%) that was associated with a marked increase in p21 expression. The antiproliferative and p21 stimulatory effects of NO were not suppressed by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ, implicating cGMP-independent signaling. The role of p53 in NO-mediated upregulation of p21 and inhibition of proliferation was evaluated using p53 -/- VSMCs. A similar reduction in cellular proliferation and upregulation of p21 expression were achieved with iNOS gene transfer as well as treatment with the NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), demonstrating the p53-independent nature of these NO-mediated pathways. The transfer of the iNOS gene activated the p42/44 MAPK, and inhibition of this MAPK pathway with PD98059 partially blocked the antiproliferative effects of NO and completely inhibited the p21 stimulatory effects of NO. For confirmation that iNOS overexpression upregulated p21 in vivo, injured rat carotid arteries were infected with an adenoviral vector carrying the iNOS gene and demonstrated a marked upregulation of p21 expression at three days. However, the ability of NO to inhibit VSMC proliferation does not solely depend on p21 upregulation since the NO-donor SNAP-inhibited VSMC proliferation in p21 -/- VSMCs.\nNitric oxide inhibits VSMC proliferation in association with the upregulation of p21; both occur independent of p53 and cGMP while being partially mediated through the p42/44 MAPK signaling cascade. This represents one potential mechanism by which NO inhibits VSMC proliferation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe a method for measuring the deep venous pressure changes in the lower extremity and compare it with those obtained in the dorsal foot vein.\nAfter cannulation of the posterior tibial vein, a catheter with a pressure transducer in its tip was inserted and placed at the knee joint level. The dorsal foot vein was also cannulated. Pressures were recorded simultaneously at both sites during toe stands and repeated with the probe in the upper, middle, and lower calf.\nThe study was performed in 45 patients with signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. Duplex Doppler scanning and ascending and descending venography performed before pressure measurements revealed saphenous vein incompetence in 11 lower extremities, incompetent perforators in 11 extremities (eight were combined with saphenous incompetence), and marked compression of popliteal vein with plantar flexion in 28 extremities. No significant deep axial reflux was observed on duplex Doppler examination or descending venography. No morphologic outflow obstruction was detected. The mean deep pressure at the knee joint level fell during toe stands, -15% +/- 27 (SD), and the mean dorsal foot vein pressure drop was even more marked, -75% +/- 22 (SD). Although the exercise pressure in the dorsal foot vein decreased in all patients (range, 13-90% drop), the popliteal vein pressure increased (4-72%) in nine limbs, decreased only marginally if at all in 15 limbs (0-15%), and fell more markedly in 21 extremities (22-65%). Deep vein recovery time was considerably shorter overall as compared with the findings by the dorsal vein measurement. In the comparison of limbs with and without superficial reflux, the recovery times in the deep system were significantly shorter in limbs with superficial incompetence.\nAmbulatory dorsal foot venous pressure is not always accurate in detecting changes in the pressure of the tibial and popliteal veins. Although dorsal foot venous pressure may be normal, deep venous pressure may decrease to a lesser degree or even increase.",

    "abstract": "Thrombolysis protects the structural and functional integrity of vein wall in an experimental model of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) immediately after treatment, but late sequelae have not been studied. We designed experiments to compare the effects of thrombolysis and surgical thrombectomy at 4 weeks after the treatment of DVT.\nDVT was produced bilaterally in male mongrel dogs by proximal and distal femoral vein ligation. Five dogs underwent sham operation. After 48 hours, the ligatures were removed, and the thrombosis was treated with either Fogarty balloon catheter thrombectomy (shear force, 60 g; n = 6) or catheter-directed urokinase infusion (4000 U/min for 90 minutes; n = 6). At 4 weeks, patency and valvular competence were determined by duplex ultrasound scanning. Thrombogenicity was studied by the measurement of radiolabeled fibrin and platelet deposition. Veins were explanted and prepared for histologic examination, scanning electron microscopy, and functional studies in organ chambers.\nAll veins were patent at 1 month. Recanalized thrombus was observed histologically in four (66%) thrombectomized veins, one (17%) thrombolyzed vein, and none of the sham-operated veins (P =.04). Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated similar luminal endothelial cell loss (11%-25%) in all three groups. Platelet and fibrin depositions were not different among groups. Valvular incompetence (reflux duration, >0.5 sec) did not differ significantly in the groups (thrombectomized veins, 2 of 12 (17%); thrombolyzed veins, 0 of 12 (0%); P = NS). In organ chamber studies, endothelium-dependent relaxations to calcium ionophore, but not adenosine diphosphate, were inhibited by an antagonist of nitric oxide production after thrombectomy (P <.05, thrombectomy vs sham- and thrombolysis-treated veins). All veins relaxed to exogenous nitric oxide.\nBoth thrombectomy and thrombolysis restored patency and achieved similar valvular competence. Surgical thrombectomy, however, resulted in more residual thrombus and contributed to changes in endothelium-mediated relaxations at 4 weeks. Thrombolysis maintained both structural integrity and endothelial function.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and management of intraoperative technical problems during endovascular repair (EVR) of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nFrom February 1995 to March 1999, 204 EVRs of nonruptured AAA were performed at our institution. One hundred seventy-six patients had an in-house custom-made graft; 172 were aorto-uni-iliac grafts, and four were aortoaortic grafts. Twenty- eight patients had a bifurcated graft. One hundred fourteen patients (56%) were high risk for conventional open repair. One hundred nine patients (53%) were not suitable for most commercially available devices.\nIntraoperative technical problems occurred in 81 patients (40%). There were 37 endoleaks (27 proximal, 10 distal), 15 graft stenoses, one failure of graft deployment, two graft thromboses, three aortoiliac ruptures, five renal artery occlusions (one bilateral, four unilateral), and 18 internal iliac occlusions (five bilateral, 13 unilateral). Endovascular management of these problems was successful in 37 of the 81 patients (46%) and included 15 balloon dilatations, 21 additional stent placements, and one graft thrombectomy. Fifteen of the 81 patients (19%) had open procedures (four periaortic ligature placements, six open aneurysm repairs, three common iliac ligations, and two extra-anatomic bypass grafts). In the remaining 29 patients, the on-table problem was managed expectantly. During follow-up, two of 37 patients (5%) who were treated successfully with endovascular procedures experienced recurrence. There were five deaths (33%) among the 15 patients who underwent open procedures.\nIntraoperative problems occur frequently during the endovascular management of complex aneurysms. Many of these problems can be managed with additional endovascular techniques without an increased risk of recurrence or procedure-related complications. Open procedures in high-risk patients carry a high mortality rate. The team performing EVR of AAA should be skillful in advanced endovascular and open surgical procedures.",

Endovascular management of these problems was successful in 37 of the 81 patients (46%) and included 15 balloon dilatations, 21 additional stent placements, and one graft thrombectomy. Fifteen of the 81 patients (19%) had open procedures (four periaortic ligature placements, six open aneurysm repairs, three common iliac ligations, and two extra-anatomic bypass grafts). In the remaining 29 patients, the on-table problem was managed expectantly. During follow-up, two of 37 patients (5%) who were treated successfully with endovascular procedures experienced recurrence. There were five deaths (33%) among the 15 patients who underwent open procedures.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of endovascular treatment of multisegment iliac occlusive disease (involving two or more common and/or external iliac arteries) was determined.\nAll patients who underwent angioplasty or stenting of at least two separate iliac artery segments were identified. Demographic data were recorded. Technical success, hemodynamic success, and aortoiliac primary and primary-assisted patency were analyzed by using the Society for Vascular Surgery and International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS) criteria. Multivariate, life table analysis was used as a means of determining outcome predictors.\nEighty-seven patients underwent 207 iliac artery angioplasties and 115 iliac artery stents, which were performed in 210 iliac segments for disabling claudication in 60% of cases, for rest pain in 17% of cases, and for tissue loss in 23% of cases. Two iliac segments were treated in 64% of patients, three segments were treated in 28% of patients, and four segments were treated in 8% of patients. The complication rate was 11%. Initial hemodynamic success was achieved in 72% of cases. Clinical improvement occurred in 88% of patients. Subsequent endovascular reintervention was required in 29% of patients, whereas surgical inflow procedures were required in 14% of patients to maintain aortoiliac patency. The mean time from the primary intervention to the first reintervention was 10 +/- 3 months. At 6, 12, and 36 months after intervention, the primary patency rates of the aortoiliac segment were 76%, 61%, and 43%, respectively, and the primary assisted patency rates were 95%, 87%, and 72%, respectively. Only the presence of an external iliac artery stenosis adversely affected both primary and assisted-primary patency.

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), the light activation of photosensitizers to produce free radicals, is known to inhibit experimental intimal hyperplasia (IH). However, its clinical application has been limited by the lack of a suitable approach and a clinically appropriate photosensitizer. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a clinical approach for PDT, while testing its ability to favorably modulate the vascular wound healing response.\nRat carotid arteries were balloon-injured (BI), and for PDT, the arteries were irradiated with thermoneutral laser light (lambda = 660 nm, 100 J/cm(2)) after the photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) was delivered locally. Control rats included BI alone and MB after BI alone. Arteries were analyzed after 2 weeks with morphometric evaluation (n = 6) and in situ hybridization for versican and procollagen type I gene expression (digitized image pixel analyses, n = 3).\nNo IH developed in PDT-treated arteries (0 +/- 0 mm(2); compared with BI, 0.192 +/- 0.006 mm(2); P <.0001). The diameters remained unchanged (PDT, 0.95 +/- 0.04 mm; BI, 0.94 +/- 0.05 mm; uninjured artery, 0.91 +/- 0.06 mm). Arterial injury resulted in an increase of versican and procollagen type I messenger RNA (mRNA) in the adventitia and neointima. In the repopulating cells of the adventitia after PDT, there was a significant decrease in versican mRNA (% of positive pixels per high-power field: PDT, 1.13% +/- 0.39%; BI, 2.93% +/- 0.61%; P <.02), but not in procollagen type I mRNA.\nThe decrease of versican mRNA expression of repopulating cells after PDT reflects favorable healing on a molecular level. Site-specific delivery of MB, a clinically appropriate photosensitizer, followed by PDT represents a suitable method to promote favorable healing after balloon intervention and further supports its role for inhibiting postinterventional restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH), a significant cause of vascular reconstructive failure, is characterized by abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. The ECM proteins, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), fibronectin (Fn), and vitronectin (Vn) can induce VSMC migration; however, the cellular signaling pathways involved are not identical for each ECM protein. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC) are two enzymes that have been associated with VSMC migration. We sought to elucidate the roles of these enzymes in TSP-1-, Fn-, and Vn-stimulated VSMC migration.\nChemotaxis assays were performed by using a modified Boyden Chamber. TSP-1, Fn, or Vn (20 microg/mL) or serum-free media (SFM) was placed in the bottom wells of the chamber. Quiescent bovine aortic VSMC were preincubated with LY 294002 (100 micromol/L), a PI3K inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203X, 1 micromol/L), a PKC inhibitor, or in SFM alone for 30 minutes. VSMCs (50,000 cells per well) were then placed in the top wells of the chamber, and the assay was conducted for 4 hours at 37 degrees C. Results were recorded as the number of cells migrated per five fields (400x) and analyzed by means of the paired t test, with P value less than.05 considered to be significant (n = 3).\nThe VSMC migration was significantly increased by TSP-1, Fn, and Vn. LY 294002 inhibited TSP-1-, Fn-, and Vn-stimulated VSMC migration (85% to 89%, P <.05). GF 109203X inhibited only TSP-1-stimulated migration (65%, P <.05).\nThese results suggest that TSP-1-, Fn-, and Vn-stimulated migration is at least partially dependent on PI3K. However, only TSP-1 stimulated migration is at least partially dependent on PKC.",

    "abstract": "Gene transfer offers the potential to modify vein graft biology at the time of surgical implantation. Efficiency of gene delivery, stability of expression, and host responses are critical parameters for candidate vectors. We compared the effects of intraluminal exposure with adenovirus (AD) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors on transgene expression and monocyte adhesion (MA) in treated vein segments.\nAdult New Zealand white rabbits (N = 51) were anesthetized, and the jugular veins were cannulated bilaterally. Veins were gently distended with either vector (2.10(8) to 1.10(10) infective particles/mL) or vehicle (control) for 30 minutes, after which venous flow was restored. AD and AAV vectors encoding for the marker genes beta-galactosidase (LacZ) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used. Vessels were explanted 2 to 40 days postinfection for analysis of gene expression (X-gal staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), MA, and immunohistochemistry. Ex vivo adhesion assays used (51)Cr-labeled THP-1 cells. Statistical significance was tested by using analysis of variance with a P value less than.05.\nAll animals survived, and all treated veins were patent at sacrifice. Intraluminal exposure to AD at a titer of 1.10(9) resulted in near complete transduction of the endothelium at 2 days, with no detectable expression by day 14. At an equal titer of infectious particles, transgene expression was markedly less for AAV at 2 to 7 days, but improved at 2 weeks and persisted to 40 days. MA was significantly increased 2 days after AD exposure (2.7-fold vs control, *P <.002); AAV treatment had no discernible effect on MA.\nAD-mediated gene transfer to vein segments resulted in robust, transient gene expression that disappeared after 2 weeks. In comparison, AAV-mediated gene delivery was less efficient, but resulted in delayed onset, persistent expression beyond 30 days. AD exposure induced an early increase in MA to the vein surface that was not seen with AAV treatment.

    "abstract": "Aortobifemoral bypass grafting is a durable operation for arterial reconstruction in patients with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease. In several small laparoscopic series technically demanding aortic operations have been described that have not gained widespread acceptance or applicability. To simplify the laparoscopic approach to the aorta, we have developed a technique of aortobifemoral bypass grafting that uses hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) to minimize the complexity of aortic dissection and reconstruction.\nFive patients with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease underwent successful HALS aortobifemoral bypass grafting. With the use of a specialized sleeve device (Hand-Port), an operative hand was introduced into the laparoscopic field while pneumoperitoneum was maintained. Laparoscopic dissection of the infrarenal aorta was then performed with retraction provided by the operative hand. Proximal aortic anastomosis was performed with an open technique through the same 7.5-cm Hand-Port incision, and femoral anastomoses were performed in the standard fashion.\nFive hand-assisted laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass grafts were performed (two end-to-end, three end-to-side proximal anastomoses). Mean operative time was 231 minutes. Mean blood loss was 440 mL. All patients underwent extubation immediately after surgery, were ambulatory on postoperative day (POD) 1, and were tolerating their diet by POD 3. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.8 days. One patient was discharged on POD 5 and started a clear liquid diet after a self-limiting postoperative ileus. All patients were asymptomatic and back to full activity/work by 14.6 days postoperatively, on average (range, 11-20 days).\nThe HALS offers the advantages of tactile feedback, flexible retraction, and the introduction of conventional surgical instruments, all of which extend laparoscopic surgery and its established benefits to a wide array of more complex surgical problems, including major vascular surgery. Ease of performance, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times all suggest that HALS may become a valuable adjunct to conventional aortobifemoral bypass grafting.",

    "conclusions": "The HALS offers the advantages of tactile feedback, flexible retraction, and the introduction of conventional surgical instruments, all of which extend laparoscopic surgery and its established benefits to a wide array of more complex surgical problems, including major vascular surgery. Ease of performance, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times all suggest that HALS may become a valuable adjunct to conventional aortobifemoral bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the early efficacy of endovascular aortouniiliac stent grafts with femorofemoral bypass graft in the treatment of aortoiliac aneurysmal disease.\nWe analyzed 51 consecutive patients from January 1997 to March 1999 with a mean follow-up of 15.8 months. Patients ranged in age from 44 to 93 years (mean, 75 years) with a mean aortic aneurysm diameter of 6.2 cm. Technical success was achieved in 50 patients; one patient required conversion to open repair intraoperatively. We placed 28 custom-made and 22 commercial devices. The mean operative time was 223 minutes. The endograft was extended to the external iliac artery in 42% of cases. The contralateral common iliac artery was occluded using either a closed covered stent or intraluminal coils.\nThe median hospital stay was 4 days with an average intensive care unit stay of 0.25 days. There were no operative mortalities. Two patients died during follow-up from unrelated conditions. Endoleaks occurred in 11 patients (22%); seven patients (14%) required intervention (four catheter based, three operative). Other complications occurred in 38% of patients but were largely remote or wound related. One femorofemoral bypass graft occluded immediately postoperatively as a result of an intraprocedural external iliac dissection yielding a 98% primary patency and 100% secondary patency. Clinical success was achieved in 88% of patients.\nThese data suggest that this strategy represents a reliable method of repair of aortoiliac aneurysmal disease and extends the capability of an endoluminal approach to patients with complex iliac anatomy.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed whether infrainguinal reconstructions with autogenous vein (IR) performed in patients with prior abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs have altered graft patency, compared with those in patients who have undergone prior aortobifemoral bypass grafting procedures (ABF) for aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nFrom 1979 to 1998, 54 patients with prior aortic reconstructions underwent 64 autogenous single-segment saphenous IRs solely for infrainguinal occlusive disease. Included in this cohort were 30 IRs with an earlier AAA repair and 34 IRs with an earlier ABF repair. During the same period, 1274 patients underwent 1642 autogenous vein lower-extremity bypass grafting procedures (LEB). Lower-extremity native arterial (AAA, n = 6; ABF, n = 11) and vein graft diameters (AAA, n = 6; ABF, n = 6) were determined by means of angiography and duplex ultrasonography, respectively. The three reconstruction groups (AAA, ABF, LEB) were compared.\nThe patients in the three groups were similar in sex, indication for operation, proximal and distal anastomotic site, and number of distal runoff vessels. The cumulative 5-year primary graft patency rate in the AAA group (92% +/- 5%) was significantly higher (P <. 001) than that in the LEB group (63% +/- 2%) and the ABF group (44% +/- 11%). Furthermore, cumulative 5-year primary patency was decreased in the ABF group compared with the LEB group (P =.05). A significant increase in both native arterial (P =.001) and vein graft diameter (P <.05) was demonstrated by using linear regression and a Student t test, respectively, in the AAA group compared with the ABF group.\nThese data demonstrate that, compared with those in patients without a previous aortic procedure, IRs in patients with prior AAA repairs have significantly improved graft patency, and IRs in patients with prior ABF reconstructions for aortoiliac occlusive disease have significantly decreased graft patency. Larger arterial diameter and altered vein graft adaptation may contribute to the superior long-term outcomes of IRs in patients with prior AAA repairs.",

    "abstract": "Various alternative conduits have been used for lower extremity revascularization when an adequate ipsilateral greater saphenous vein is absent. This study compared the effectiveness of all-autogenous multisegment arm vein bypass grafts with that of composite grafts composed of combined prosthetic and autogenous conduits.\nOne hundred fifty-three lower extremity revascularization procedures performed between 1990 and 1998 were followed up prospectively using a computerized vascular registry. The grafts were composed of spliced arm vein segments with venovenostomy in 122 and of composite prosthetic-autogenous conduit in 31. Arm vein conduit was prepared by means of intraoperative angioscopy for valve lysis and identification of luminal abnormalities in 47.7% of cases.\nBypass graft configurations were as follows: femoropopliteal (12 arm vein, 2 composite); femorotibial (75 arm vein, 23 composite); femoropedal (14 arm vein, 6 composite), and popliteo-tibial/pedal (21 arm vein, 0 composite). The indication for surgery was limb salvage in 98% and disabling claudication in 2% of cases. The mean follow-up was 25.1 months (range, 1 month to 7.9 years). Overall survival at 4 years was 51%. Overall patency and limb salvage rates were as follows: primary patency, at 1 year-arm vein, 76.9% +/- 4.8%; composite, 59. 5% +/- 9.6% (P =.02); at 3 years-arm vein, 70.0% +/- 8.0%; composite, 43.7% +/- 12.4% (P <.01); and at 5 years-arm vein, 53.8% +/- 8.7%; composite, 0%; secondary patency, at 1 year-arm vein, 77.5% +/- 4. 6%; composite, 59.8% +/- 9.5% (P =.02); at 3 years-arm vein, 70.7% +/- 7.5%, composite, 44.9% +/- 13.1% (P <.01); at 5 years-arm vein, 57.7% +/- 8.0%; composite, 0%; limb salvage, at 1 year-arm vein, 89. 3% +/- 3.7%; composite, 73.9% +/- 8.9% (P <.01); at 3 years-arm vein, 80.5% +/- 7.0%; composite, 49.6% +/- 14.3% (P <.01); at 5 years-arm vein, 76.3% +/- 9.9%; composite, 0%.\nIn this study, multisegment autogenous arm vein was used successfully in a wide variety of lower extremity revascularization procedures and achieved good long-term patency and limb salvage rates, well in excess of those achieved with composite prosthetic-autogenous grafts. The use of autogenous conduit appears to offer superior results to composite conduit in lower extremity revascularization.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of treatment of nonhealing heel ulcers and gangrene and to define those variables that are associated with success.\nA multi-institutional review was undertaken at four university or university-affiliated hospitals of all patients with wounds of the heel and arterial insufficiency, which was defined as absent pedal pulses and a decreased ankle/brachial index (ABI). Risk factors, hemodynamic parameters, and arteriographic findings were statistically analyzed to determine their effect on wound healing. Life-table analysis was used to assess graft patency and wound healing.\nNinety-one patients (57 men, 34 women) were treated for heel wounds that did not heal for 1 to 12 months (62% of nonhealing wounds, 3 months or longer). The mean preoperative ABI was 0.51, and 31% of wounds were infected. Of the patients, 55% had impaired renal function (Cr > 1.5), with 24% undergoing dialysis, 70% had diabetes, and 64% smoked cigarettes. Treatment was topical wound care for all patients and operative wound d\u00e9bridement in 50%. Infrainguinal bypass was performed for 81 patients, 4 had inflow procedures, 3 had superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and 3 had primary below-knee amputation. Postoperatively, 85% of patients had in-line flow to the foot with at least a single patent vessel, 66% had a pedal pulse, and the mean ABI improved by 0.40, to 0.91. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 60 months (mean, 21 months), and 77 patients (85%) are currently alive. In 66 patients (73%), the wounds healed-all within 6 months (mean, 3 months). For 14 (16%) the wounds had not healed, and 11 patients (11%) underwent below-knee amputation. By life-table analysis, limb salvage was 86% at 3 years. During follow-up, 75 infrainguinal bypasses (91%) remained patent (3 secondarily) and 6 occluded, with primary assisted patency of 87% at 3 years. All wounds in patients with occluded grafts failed to heal. Variables found to be statistically significant in predicting healing included normal renal function (95% healed vs 55% nonhealed, P <.002), a palpable pedal pulse (85% healed vs 42%, P <.0015), a patent posterior tibial artery past the ankle (86% healed vs 57%, P <.02), and the number of patent tibial arteries after bypass to the ankle (P <.0001). Neither the ABI nor the presence of infection (defined as positive tissue cultures or the presence of osteomyelitis), diabetes, or other cardiovascular risk factors influenced the outcome.\nComplete wound healing of ischemic heel ulcers or gangrene may require up to 6 months, and short-term graft patency is of minimal benefit. Successful arterial reconstruction, especially a patent posterior tibial artery after bypass, is effective in treating most heel ulcers or gangrene. Patients with impaired renal function are at increased risk for failure of treatment, but their wounds may successfully heal and they should not be denied revascularization procedures.",

Variables found to be statistically significant in predicting healing included normal renal function (95% healed vs 55% nonhealed, P <.002), a palpable pedal pulse (85% healed vs 42%, P <.0015), a patent posterior tibial artery past the ankle (86% healed vs 57%, P <.02), and the number of patent tibial arteries after bypass to the ankle (P <.0001). Neither the ABI nor the presence of infection (defined as positive tissue cultures or the presence of osteomyelitis), diabetes, or other cardiovascular risk factors influenced the outcome.",

The mean age was 69.8 +/- 8.7 years for men and 71.2 +/- 8.5 years for women (P <.001).

Female patients were more likely to be asymptomatic at presentation (men, 44% vs women, 51%; P =.022). Postoperative myocardial infarction occurred in eight patients (0.6%) with no differences between men (0.4%) and women (1.0%) (P = not significant).

    "abstract": "We developed and applied a method for providing regional spinal cord hypothermia with epidural cooling (EC) during thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair. Preliminary results indicated significant reduction in spinal cord ischemic complications (SCI), compared with historical controls, and a 5-year experience with EC was reviewed.\nFrom July 1993 to September 1998, 170 patients with thoracic aneurysms (n = 14; 8.2%) or TAAs (types I and II, n = 83 [49%]; type III, n = 66 [39%]; type IV, n = 7 [4.1%]) were treated with EC. An earlier aneurysm resection was noted in 44% of patients, an emergent operation was noted in 20% of patients, and an aortic dissection was noted in 16% of patients. The EC was successful (mean cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] temperature at cross-clamp, 26.4 +/- 3 degrees C) in 97% of cases, with all 170 patients included in an intention-to-treat analysis. The operation was performed with a clamp/sew technique (98% patients) and selective (T(9) to L(1) region) reimplantation of intercostal vessels. Clinical and EC variables were examined for association with operative mortality and SCI by means of the Fischer exact test, and those variables with a P value less than.1 were included in multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nThe operative mortality rate was 9.5% and was weakly associated (P =.07) with SCI; postoperative cardiac complications (odds ratio [OR], 35. 3; 95% CI, 5.3 to 233; P <.001) and renal failure (OR, 32.2; 95% CI, 6.6 to 157; P <.001) were the only independent predictors of postoperative death. SCI of any severity occurred in 7% of cases (type I/II, 10 of 83 [12%]; all other types, 2 of 87 [2.3%]), versus a predicted (Acher model) incidence of 18.5% for this cohort (P =. 003). Half the deficits were minor, with good functional recovery, and devastating paraplegia occurred in three patients (2.0%). Independent correlates of SCI included types I and II TAA (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.4 to 46.3; P =.021), nonelective operation (OR, 8.3, 95% CI, 1.8 to 37.7; P =.006), oversewn T(9) to L(2) intercostal vessels (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 28.8; P =.023), and postoperative renal failure (OR, 23.6; 95% CI, 4.4 to 126; P <.001). These same clinical variables of nonelective operations (OR, 7.7; 95% CI, 1.4 to 41.4; P =.017), oversewn T(9) to L(2) intercostal arteries (OR, 9.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 61.2; P =.016), and postoperative renal failure (OR, 20.8; 95% CI, 3.0 to 142.1; P =.002) were independent predictors of SCI in the subgroup analysis of high-risk patients, ie, patients with type I/II TAA.\nEC has been effective in reducing immediate, devastating, total paraplegia after TAA repair. A strategy that combines the neuroprotective effect of regional cord hypothermia, avoiding the sacrifice of potential spinal cord blood supply, and postoperative adjuncts (eg, avoidance of hypotension, CSF drainage) appears necessary to minimize SCI after TAA repair.",

When left leg pain occurred 3 months earlier, radiographic examination revealed an exostosis with a cartilage cap. Serial radiographic examination demonstrated gradual disruption of the cartilage cap of the exostosis as the pseudoaneurysm developed. An exostosis with an irregular surface was found at surgery. A literature review disclosed 39 similar cases in which loss of the cartilage cap was considered as one of the causes of the aneurysm formation. Considering the clinical course of our patient, however, we believe that exostoses lose their cartilage caps by pressure destruction due to the aneurysms. It is highly probable that loss of the cartilage does not cause the aneurysms.",

We investigated the effects of the anti-excitotoxic drugs magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) and riluzole in a rabbit model of spinal cord ischemia.\nThe infrarenal aorta of New Zealand albino white rabbits (n = 68) was occluded for 40 minutes. Experimental groups included: a control group, which received only vehicle (n = 17); group A (n = 17), which received riluzole (8 mg/kg) before clamping; group B (n = 17), which received MgSO(4) (100 mg/kg) before clamping; and group C (n = 17), which received riluzole (8 mg/kg) and MgSO(4) (100 mg/kg) before clamping. Five additional rabbits had the same operation, but did not undergo aortic clamping (sham operation). The neurological status of the rabbits was assessed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and then daily for as long as 120 hours by using a modified Tarlov scale. The rabbits were killed at 24 hours (n = 3 per group), 48 hours (n = 4 per group), and 120 hours (n = 10 per group) postoperatively. Spinal cords were harvested for histopathologic and immunohistochemistry examinations for microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), a cytoskeletal protein specific from neurons.\nNo major adverse effect was observed with either riluzole or MgSO(4). All control rabbits became severely paraplegic. All riluzole-treated and MgSO(4)-treated animals had a better neurological status than control animals. Typical morphological changes characteristic of neuronal necrosis in the gray matter of control animals was demonstrated by means of the histopathological examination, whereas riluzole or magnesium prevented or attenuated necrotic phenomenons. Moreover, MAP-2 immunoreactivity was completely lost in control rabbits, whereas it was preserved, either completely or partially, in rabbits treated with riluzole or magnesium. Riluzole was more effective than MgSO(4) in preventing paraplegia caused by motor neuron injury (P <.01 ). Riluzole and MgSO(4) had no additive neuroprotective effect.\nThese results demonstrate that riluzole and, to a lesser extent, MgSO(4) may afford significant spinal cord protection in a setting of severe ischemia and may, therefore, be considered for clinical use during \"high-risk\" operations on the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury and the resultant postoperative paraplegia are devastating complications of thoracic aortic surgery, for which no widely accepted protective interventions exist. We hypothesized that retrograde venous perfusion-cooling of the spinal cord with a hypothermic saline and adenosine solution would protect it from ischemic injury caused by thoracic aortic occlusion.\nAdult domestic swine of either sex (weight range, 20 to 30 kg) were intubated and ventilated. A left thoracotomy was performed. The accessory hemiazygous vein was divided, and a catheter was inserted distally. The aorta was clamped at the left subclavian artery. The venous catheter was not used in the animals in the control group (n = 7); in the animals in the experimental group (n = 7), a cold (4 degrees C) saline and adenosine solution was infused into the accessory hemiazygous vein. After 30 minutes, the clamp and catheter were removed, and the chest was closed. A blinded observer evaluated the animals' hind-leg motor activity 24 hours later. The Tarlov scale was used: 0, complete paralysis; 1, minimal movement; 2, stands with assistance; 3, stands alone; 4, weak walk; 5, normal gait. The animals' rectal temperatures were measured at the end of the experiment, and blood pressure was measured throughout. Two other groups were studied to assess the effect of the intervention on spinal cord temperature.\nThe animals in the control group had a mean Tarlov score of 1.7 +/- 0.6; the animals in the experimental group had a mean Tarlov score of 4.9 +/- 0.1 (P <.01). The animals in the experimental group had a significantly greater drop in spinal cord temperature than those in the control group (4. 05 +/- 0.6 degrees C vs 0.58 +/- 0.12 degrees C; P <.01). No significant difference in rectal temperatures was found, nor did any arrhythmias or hypotensive episodes occur in either group. Perfusion of the spinal cord was confirmed with angiography by using this approach.\nRetrograde venous perfusion-cooling of the spinal cord with a hypothermic saline and adenosine solution protects the cord from ischemic injury caused by clamping of the thoracic aorta.",

    "abstract": "During thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, a prolonged interruption of the spinal cord blood supply can result in irreversible spinal cord damage. The aim of this study was to investigate whether selective segmental artery perfusion during aortic clamping could prevent paraplegia in pigs.\nSpecially designed segmental artery perfusion catheters, which could be attached to an extracorporeal bypass graft system, were used. In experiment I (n = 10), it was assessed whether selective segmental artery perfusion could reverse electrophysiologic evidence of spinal cord ischemia and maintain transcranial motor evoked potentials (tc-MEPs) during 60 minutes of aortic cross-clamping. The abdominal aorta, containing critical segmental arteries, was bypassed through use of an aortoaortic bypass graft system. After the disappearance of tc-MEPs, an aortotomy was followed by selective segmental artery perfusion. In experiment II (n = 10), the aim was to determine whether selective segmental artery perfusion could prevent paraplegia. In five animals (group A), aortic cross-clamping was followed by selective segmental artery perfusion; five control animals (group B) underwent segmental artery blockade only. Postoperative hind limb function and spinal cord histopathology were evaluated on the third postoperative day.\nIn experiment I, tc-MEPs disappeared within 3.7 +/- 3.7 minutes after cross-clamping and returned in all animals in 8.5 +/- 5.3 minutes after selective perfusion. During the study period, tc-MEP amplitudes recovered to a median of 49% (range, 28%-113%) of baseline values. Total bypass graft flow was 880 +/- 294 mL/min, of which 184 +/- 54 mL/min was directed to the selective perfusion catheters. The flow in individual catheters was 52 +/- 13 mL/min. In experiment II, all perfused animals demonstrated normal hind limb function, whereas four of five control animals were paraplegic on day 3 (P =.04) In the perfused animals, histopathologic examination showed either no spinal cord damage or eosinophilic neurons only, whereas in paraplegic controls there was infarction in large areas of the cord (P <.0001).\nIn pigs, selective segmental artery perfusion can provide sufficient spinal cord blood flow to prevent paraplegia resulting from 60 minutes of aortic clamping, as shown by clinical outcomes and histopathologic examination.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the value of the Bernoulli-predicted pressure gradient in the noninvasive evaluation of patients undergoing iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or stent placement with the use of intra-arterial pressure measurements as the standard of reference.\nStent placement or PTA was performed in 261 patients with intermittent claudication caused by iliac artery stenoses (333 procedures). Intra-arterial translesional pressure gradients were recorded before and after each procedure. Hemodynamic success was defined as a postprocedural mean pressure gradient less than or equal to 10 mm Hg at rest and during vasodilatation. Before and after intervention, the following noninvasive parameters were determined: the Bernoulli-predicted pressure gradient, the peak systolic velocity ratio, and the ankle-brachial pressure index.\nBefore treatment, both the intra-arterial-measured pressure gradients and the Bernoulli-predicted gradients indicated hemodynamic significance of the iliac artery stenoses. After treatment, both methods indicated significant improvement of the translesional pressure gradient (P <. 0001). However, the correlation between the intra-arterially measured pressure gradient and the Bernoulli-predicted gradient of iliac artery stenoses was low (Pearson's r = 0.27). None of the three investigated noninvasive methods could differentiate an optimal PTA or stent result from a suboptimal result, as assessed by intra-arterial pressure measurements.\nThe disappointing correlation among the duplex velocity data, whether expressed as pressure gradient or as a peak systolic velocity ratio, and the actually measured pressure gradient might be caused by errors in pressure or velocity measurements or the different circumstances in which the pressure or velocity measurements were performed. Residual pressure gradients after iliac PTA or stent placement assessed with intra-arterial pressure measurements could not be assessed with the investigated noninvasive methods.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular graft techniques hold great potential as a less invasive means for the repair of aortic aneurysms, yet the impact of these new modalities remains poorly elucidated.\nOver a 10-month period at a single institution, 139 patients underwent infrarenal aortic aneurysm repair through a traditional open surgical technique (OS group, 94 patients) or an endovascular approach (ES group, 45 patients). Coated polyester prostheses (Hemashield; Boston Scientific Corporation, Boston, Mass) were used in the OS patients, whereas a modular nitinol polyester device (AneuRx; Medtronic, Sunnyvale, Calif) was used in the ES group. The hospital costs exclusive of professional charges were tabulated for the two groups using the hospital cost accounting system. Outliers were included in the data analysis.\nThe mean operating room time was longer in the OS group than in the ES group (285 minutes vs 166 minutes). The average length of stay was also longer in the OS group (9.7 days vs 3.2 days). Hospital costs related to the length of stay were higher in the OS group, including laboratory costs ($327 higher), pharmacy costs ($688 higher), and nursing costs ($780 higher). Anesthesia costs were also higher in the OS group ($493 higher). Despite these marked differences, the total hospital cost averaged $7205 more in the ES group, a finding that was driven by the cost of the implantable devices themselves ($8976 in the ES group vs $597 in the OS group).\nDespite reductions in the length of hospitalization, the cost of care was substantially greater in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair than in patients in whom an open surgical technique was used. These differences are driven by the cost of the endograft device itself, a cost that must not exceed $6000 if the economic impact of endovascular repair is to be in parity with traditional methods. Unless these economic disparities can be ameliorated, the economic impact of endovascular aneurysm repair may limit the widespread application of this technology.",

There was a consecutive series of patients undergoing bedside preinsertion cavagrams with inferior vena cava filter insertion. The setting was an 825-bed tertiary care hospital. The subjects were trauma patients undergoing inferior vena cava filter insertion.\nThe intervention used was vena cavagrams with CO(2) as the contrast agent. The main outcomes we measured were image quality, adverse reactions, cardiorespiratory changes, and renal failure.\nTen patients underwent CO(2) cavography. All cavagrams were successful, demonstrating opacification of the inferior vena cava with identification of the renal veins and iliac bifurcation. There were no adverse reactions of renal failure.\nCarbon dioxide-contrasted vena cavagrams can be safely performed at the bedside, and they give good opacification of the inferior vena cava.",

    "abstract": "Treatment designed to eliminate thrombus in patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is theoretically attractive; however, its benefits, compared with those of anticoagulation, have not been definitively demonstrated. Although not previously analyzed, an effective measure of treatment success is likely to be the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study evaluated whether catheter-directed thrombolysis for iliofemoral DVT is associated with improved HRQOL, compared with standard anticoagulation, and whether HRQOL outcome in the thrombolysis group is related to lytic success.\nAn 80-item self-administered HRQOL questionnaire was developed. It contained the Health Utilities Index, Short Form-12, and disease-targeted scales, including health distress, stigma, health interference, physical functioning, and symptoms (eg, leg swelling, pain, ulcers). The HRQOL questionnaire was confirmed to be reliable and valid by means of psychometric testing. Questionnaires were administered to 98 retrospectively identified patients who had had iliofemoral DVT treated at least 6 months earlier. Sixty-eight patients who were identified through a DVT registry were treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis with urokinase (UK), and 30 patients who were identified by means of a medical record review were treated with anticoagulation alone. The treatment decision was made by the attending physician, and all patients were candidates for both thrombolysis and anticoagulation.\nMost patients were women (61%), white (95%), married (65%), and had a mean interval since initial DVT of 16 months. The group treated with UK was younger (53 +/- 17 years) than the group treated with heparin (61 +/- 6 years; P =.039). After treatment, patients treated with UK reported better overall physical functioning (P =.046), less stigma (P =.033), less health distress (P =.022), and fewer post-thrombotic symptoms (P =. 006), compared with the patients treated with anticoagulation alone. Within the UK group, phlebographically successful lysis correlated with improved HRQOL (P =.038). Patients classified as lytic failures had similar outcomes to patients treated with heparin.\nPatients with iliofemoral DVT treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis have better functioning and well-being, compared with patients treated with anticoagulation alone. Successful lysis was directly correlated with improved HRQOL, with patients who were classified as lytic failures having similar outcomes to patients treated with heparin. These data support the need for a future randomized trial, which should include an HRQOL measure as part of the outcome analysis.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with two generations of prostheses was analyzed and compared.\nBetween May 1992 and December 1998, 266 patients underwent elective endoluminal repair of an AAA. First-generation prostheses were used in 118 patients (group I), and second-generation prostheses were used in 148 patients (group II). The two groups were similar in age, sex, and size of AAA. The proportion of patients with comorbidities was higher in group I than in group II, but not significantly. First-generation devices were characterized by large (24F internal diameter) delivery systems, one-piece construction, and a lack of metallic support throughout their length. Second-generation devices had smaller (21F or smaller internal diameter) delivery systems, modular construction, and a metallic frame throughout the length of the prostheses. The major end-point criteria were survival and successful endoluminal repair. Success was defined as the exclusion of the aneurysm sac from the circulation, with stability or the reduction in AAA maximum transverse diameter. Persistent endoleaks were classified as failures, irrespective of whether they were subsequently corrected by means of secondary endovascular intervention. The minimum follow-up period was 5 months for each of the 266 patients. Analysis was performed by means of the life-table method.\nPerioperative mortality was not significantly different between group I (4.2%) and group II (2.7%). There was a statistically significant difference between the survival curves of the two generations, which favored group II (P =.012). There was a significant (P <.001) difference between the two generations of patients in their conditional probability of graft failure when the competing risk of all-cause mortality was considered. Second-generation patients were at a lower risk of graft failure than first-generation patients. The probability of failure, expressed as a proportion of grafts failing at 2 years, was 0.15 for patients with second-generation prostheses and 0.33 for patients with first-generation prostheses.\nEndoluminal AAA repair is a safe procedure, whether first- or second-generation prostheses are used. Survival and probability of graft success were significantly higher with second-generation prostheses than with first-generation prostheses. This improvement in outcome resulted from a combination of increasing clinical experience and advances in technology. A more accurate evaluation of the role of the endoluminal method in AAA repair would be achieved by studying patients in whom second-generation devices were used, rather than longer term studies in which first- and second-generation devices were used.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether systemic administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) would promote endothelialization for small-caliber Dacron vascular grafts.\nWe implanted 4-mm preclotted Dacron grafts in both carotids of 12 dogs. For a fair comparison, all dogs had a comparable platelet aggregation profile with platelet aggregation scores less than 30. Five dogs served as controls, and the others were given 7-day subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (10 microg/kg per day), starting on the seventh postoperative day. The effect of G-CSF was evaluated by white blood cell count, which showed a 3.7-fold (+/- 2.7-fold) increase at the end of treatment. Grafts were harvested at 4 weeks. All G-CSF grafts were patent, and one control occluded. Endothelial-like cell coverage averaged 80.8% on G-CSF grafts, but only 35.6% for control grafts (P <.0004). With the exclusion of the anastomotic pannus healing factor, the difference in endothelial-like cell coverage was even greater (68.5% vs 9.8%; P <.0001). Immunocytochemical staining and electron microscopy studies demonstrated endothelial cells. Light microscopy also showed that there were more microvessels on and in the G-CSF grafts than in the control grafts. This study suggests that G-CSF can enhance early endothelialization of small-caliber vascular grafts. Further studies to determine the proper dosage and timing are needed before clinical application can be recommended.",

    "abstract": "Untreated abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) enlarge at a mean rate of 3.9 mm/y with great individual variability. We sought to determine the effect of endovascular repair on the rate of change in aneurysm size.\nThere were 110 patients who underwent endovascular AAA repair at Stanford University Medical Center and who were followed up for 1 to 30 months (mean, 10 months) with serial contrast-infused helical computed tomography (CT). Maximal aneurysm diameter was determined using two independent methods: (1) measured manually, from cross-sectional computed tomography (XSCT) angiograms and (2) calculated from quantitative three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) data as orthonormal diameter.\nMaximal cross-sectional aneurysm diameter measured by hand (XSCT) and calculated as orthonormal values (3DCT) correlated closely (r = 0.915; P <.001). The XSCT-measured diameter was larger by 2.3 +/- 3. 75 mm (P <.001), and the 95% CI for SE of the bias was 1.85 to 2.75 mm. Preoperative aneurysm diameter (XSCT 59.1 +/- 8.4 mm; 3DCT 58.1 +/- 9.3 mm) did not differ significantly from the initial postoperative diameter. Considering all patients, XSCT diameter decreased at a rate of 0.34 +/- 0.69 mm/mo, and 3DCT diameter decreased at a rate of 0.28 +/- 0.79 mm/mo. Aneurysms in patients without endoleaks had a higher rate of decrease, an XSCT diameter by 0.50 +/- 0.74 mm/mo, and 3DCT diameter by 0.46 +/- 0.84 mm/mo. In these patients, mean absolute decrease in diameter at 6 months was 3. 4 +/- 4.5 mm (XSCT) and 3.3 +/- 5.9 mm (3DCT) and at 12 months, 5.9 +/- 5.7 mm (XSCT) and 5.4 +/- 5.7 mm (3DCT). Aneurysms in patients with persistent endoleaks did not change in mean XSCT diameter, and 3DCT diameter increased by 0.12 +/- 0.52 mm/mo (not significant). Aneurysm diameter remained within 4 mm of original size in 68% (3DCT) to 71% (XSCT) of patients. In one patient, aneurysm diameter increased (XSCT and 3DCT) more than 5 mm. Four patients who had a new onset endoleak had a much higher expansion rate than those with a chronic endoleak (P <.05).\nThe rate of decrease in aneurysm size (annualized 3.4-4.1 mm/y) after endovascular repair of AAA approximates the reported expansion rate in untreated aneurysms. However, individual aneurysm behavior is unpredictable, and the presence of an endoleak is unreliable in predicting changes in diameter. New onset endoleaks are associated with an enlargement rate greater than that of untreated aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether evidence of blood flow in the aneurysm sac (endoleak) is a meaningful predictor of clinical outcome after successful endovascular aneurysm repair.\nWe reviewed all patients in Phase II of the AneuRx Multicenter Clinical Trial with successful stent graft implantation and predischarge contrast computed tomographic (CT) imaging. The clinical outcome of patients with evidence of endoleak was compared with the outcome of patients without evidence of endoleak. The CT endoleak status before hospital discharge at 6, 12, and 24 months was determined by each clinical center as well as by an independent core laboratory. Endoleak status at 1 month was assessed with duplex scanning examination or CT at each center without confirmation by the core laboratory.\nCenters reported endoleaks in 152 (38%) of 398 patients on predischarge CT, whereas the core laboratory reported endoleaks in 50% of these patients (P <.001). The center-reported endoleak rate decreased to 13% at 1 month. Follow-up extended to 2 years (mean, 10 +/- 4 months). One patient had aneurysm rupture and underwent successful open repair at 14 months. This patient had a Type I endoleak at discharge but no endoleak at 1 month or at subsequent follow-up times. There were no differences between patients with and patients without endoleak at discharge in the following outcome measures: patient survival, aneurysm rupture, surgical conversion, the need for an additional procedure for endoleak or graft patency, aneurysm enlargement more than 5 mm, the appearance of a new endoleak, or stent graft migration. Despite a higher endoleak rate identified by the core laboratory, neither the endoleak rate reported by the core laboratory nor the endoleak rate reported by the center at discharge was significantly related to subsequent outcome measures. Patients with endoleak at 1 month were more likely to undergo an additional procedure for endoleak than patients without endoleaks. Patients with Type I endoleaks at discharge and patients with endoleak at 1 month were more likely to experience aneurysm enlargement at 1 year. However, there was no difference in patient survival, aneurysm rupture rate, or primary or secondary success rate between patients with or without endoleak. Actuarial survival of all patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair was 96% at 1 year and was independent of endoleak status. Primary outcome success was 92% at 12 months and 88% at 18 months. Secondary outcome success was 96% at 12 months and 94% at 18 months.\nThe presence or absence of endoleak on CT scan before hospital discharge does not appear to predict patient survival or aneurysm rupture rate after endovascular aneurysm repair using the AneuRx stent graft. Although the identification of blood flow in the aneurysm sac after endovascular repair is a meaningful finding and may at times indicate inadequate stent graft fixation, the usefulness of endoleak as a primary indicator of procedural success or failure is unclear. Therefore, all patients who have undergone endovascular aneurysm repair should be carefully followed up regardless of endoleak status.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed in a prospective, blinded fashion whether a reversible defect on dipyridamole-thallium (DTHAL)/sestamibi (DMIBI) can predict adverse cardiac events after elective vascular surgery in patients with one or more clinical risk factors.\nConsecutive patients with one or more clinical risk factors underwent a preoperative blinded DTHAL/DMIBI. Patients with recent congestive heart failure (CHF) or myocardial infarction (MI) or severe or unstable angina were excluded.\nEighty patients (78% men; mean age, 65 years) completed the study. Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent clinical risk factor (73%), followed by age older than 70 years (41%), angina (29%), Q wave on electrocardiogram (26%), history of CHF (7%), and ventricular ectopy (3%). The results of DTHAL/DMIBI were normal in 36 patients (45%); a reversible plus or minus fixed defect was demonstrated in 28 patients (36%), and a fixed defect alone was demonstrated in 15 patients (19%). Nine adverse cardiac events (11%) occurred, including three cases of CHF, and one case each of unstable angina, Q wave MI, non-Q wave MI, and cardiac arrest (successfully resuscitated). Two cardiac deaths occurred (2% overall mortality), one after a Q wave MI and one after CHF and a non-Q wave MI. The cardiac event rate was 14% for reversible defect and 9.8% without reversible defect (P =.71). The cardiac event rate was 12.5% (one of eight cases) for two or more reversible defects, versus 11.1% (eight of 72 cases) for fewer than two reversible defects (P = 1.0). The sensitivity rate of two or more areas of redistribution was 11% (95% CI, 0.3%-48%), the specificity rate was 90%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 12.5% and 89%, respectively.\nOur study demonstrated no association between reversible defects on DTHAL/DMIBI and adverse cardiac events in moderate-risk patients undergoing elective vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the dilemma posed by the observations that carotid angioplasty dislodges significant numbers of plaque fragments but is reported to have a low rate of neurologic consequences. We examined the fragments released by ex vivo carotid angioplasty. The smaller and most numerous were separated by size and injected into rats to determine the tolerance of the brain to microemboli.\nEx vivo angioplasty was performed on a total of 20 human carotid plaques removed en bloc. Plaques were placed within polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, and three manipulations were performed: guide wire insertion, 3.5- or 4.0-mm balloon angioplasty, and 5-mm angioplasty with or without a Palmaz stent. After each manipulation, the lumen was flushed, effluent was collected, and fragments were counted under 100x magnification. Using 200-microm and 500-microm micropore mesh, we separated fragments by size into two groups: (1) less than 200 microm and (2) 200 to 500 microm. We then injected rats with saline alone (Group A), with 100 fragments less than 200 microm (Group B), or with 100 fragments 200 to 500 microm (Group C). Animals were euthanized at 1, 3, and 7 days, and brain sections were examined for cell viability and expression of HSP- 72.\nThe total number of fragments dislodged from the plaques varied from 30 to 553. The mean number of fragments released with each manipulation was as follows: guide wire passage, 24; initial balloon angioplasty, 97; second balloon angioplasty, 68; and second angioplasty plus stent, 172. Sixteen of the 20 plaques dislodged fragments that were 1 mm or more in greatest dimension. There was no evidence of brain ischemia in Group A at any time. Group B also showed no injury at 1 or 3 days. However, injection of 200- to 500-microm fragments (Group C) caused a scattered pattern of neuronal cell death. At 7 days, brain sections from both Group B and Group C animals had a scattered pattern of ischemic neurons. There were no classic wedge-shaped infarctions.\nThe brain appears to have a surprising tolerance for microembolization in the acute setting. Thus, carotid angioplasty may dislodge plaque fragments, but there may still be a low incidence of stroke. However, even small plaque fragments, less than 200 microm, may cause neuronal ischemia at later time points. Periprocedural microemboli could cause subtle neurologic dysfunction in late follow-up.",

Sixteen of the 20 plaques dislodged fragments that were 1 mm or more in greatest dimension. There was no evidence of brain ischemia in Group A at any time. Group B also showed no injury at 1 or 3 days. However, injection of 200- to 500-microm fragments (Group C) caused a scattered pattern of neuronal cell death. At 7 days, brain sections from both Group B and Group C animals had a scattered pattern of ischemic neurons. There were no classic wedge-shaped infarctions.",

    "abstract": "The role of thoracic outlet decompression in the treatment of primary axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis remains controversial. The timing and indications for surgery are not well defined, and thoracic outlet procedures may be associated with infrequent, but significant, morbidity. We examined the outcomes of patients treated with or without surgery after the results of initial thrombolytic therapy and a short period of outpatient anticoagulation.\nPatients suspected of having a primary deep venous thrombosis underwent an urgent color-flow venous duplex ultrasound scan, followed by a venogram and catheter-directed thrombolysis. They were then converted from heparin to outpatient warfarin. Patients who remained asymptomatic received anticoagulants for 3 months. Patients who, at 4 weeks, had persistent symptoms of venous hypertension and positional obstruction of the subclavian vein, venous collaterals, or both demonstrated by means of venogram underwent thoracic outlet decompression and postoperative anticoagulation for 1 month.\nTwenty-two patients were treated between June 1996 and June 1999. Of the 18 patients who received catheter-directed thrombolysis, complete patency was achieved in eight patients (44%), and partial patency was achieved in the remaining 10 patients (56%). Nine of 22 patients (41%) did not require surgery, and the remaining 13 patients underwent thoracic outlet decompression through a supraclavicular approach with scalenectomy, first-rib resection, and venolysis. Recurrent thrombosis developed in only one patient during the immediate period of anticoagulation. Eleven of 13 patients (85%) treated with surgery and eight of nine patients (89%) treated without surgery sustained durable relief of their symptoms and a return to their baseline level of physical activity. All patients who underwent surgery maintained their venous patency on follow-up duplex scanning imaging.\nNot all patients with primary axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis require surgical intervention. A period of observation while patients are receiving oral anticoagulation for at least 1 month allows the selection of patients who will do well with nonoperative therapy. Patients with persistent symptoms and venous obstruction should be offered thoracic outlet decompression. Chronic anticoagulation is not required in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Although superficial venous reflux is an important determinant of post-thrombotic skin changes, the origin of this reflux is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and etiologic mechanisms of superficial venous reflux after acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT).\nPatients with a documented acute lower extremity DVT were asked to return for serial venous duplex ultrasound examinations at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, every 3 months for the first year, and every year thereafter. Reflux in the greater saphenous vein (GSV) and lesser saphenous vein (LSV) was assessed by standing distal pneumatic cuff deflation.\nSixty-six patients with a DVT in 69 lower extremities were followed up for a mean of 48 (SD +/- 32) months. Initial thrombosis of the GSV was noted in 15 limbs (21.7%). At 8 years, the cumulative incidence of GSV reflux was 77.1% (SE +/- 0.11) in DVT limbs with GSV involvement, 28.9% (+/- 0.09%) in DVT limbs without GSV thrombosis, and 14.8% (+/- 0.05) in uninvolved contralateral limbs (P <.0001). For LSV reflux, the cumulative incidence in DVT limbs was 23.1% (+/- 0.06%) in comparison with 10% (+/- 0.06%) in uninvolved limbs (P =.06). In comparison with uninvolved contralateral limbs, the relative risk of GSV reflux for DVT limbs with and without GSV thrombosis was 8.7 (P <.001) and 1.4 (P =.5), respectively. The relative risk of LSV reflux in thrombosed extremities compared with uninvolved extremities was 3.2 (P =.07). Despite these observations, the fraction of observed GSV reflux that could be attributable to superficial thrombosis was only 49%.\nSuperficial venous thrombosis frequently accompanies DVT and is associated with development of superficial reflux in most limbs. However, a substantial proportion of observed reflux is not directly associated with thrombosis and develops at a rate equivalent to that in uninvolved limbs.",

    "abstract": "Complete revascularization is recommended by many authors for treatment of intestinal ischemia. The observation that postprandial intestinal hyperemia is limited to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) has suggested to us that SMA revascularization alone should be adequate treatment. We preferentially manage intestinal ischemia with a single bypass graft to the SMA and herein update our results using this approach.\nPatients were identified from a prospectively established vascular surgical registry. Each patient was assessed for acute versus chronic intestinal ischemia, preoperative angiographic findings, operation used, perioperative morbidity and mortality, late symptomatic relief, cause of death, and life table-determined survival and graft patency. Graft patency was determined by follow-up angiography or duplex scanning.\nFifty bypass grafts to the SMA alone were performed in 49 patients (31 women, 18 men; mean age, 62 years) for treatment of intestinal ischemia. In all patients additional splanchnic arteries were available for bypass grafting. Operative indications were acute symptoms in 21 patients, 14 of whom had bowel infarction; chronic symptoms in 26 patients; and prophylaxis in conjunction with infrarenal aortic surgery in 3 patients. Thirty-two grafts originated from the aorta or an iliac artery, and 18 originated from an aortic graft. There were 40 prosthetic and 10 autogenous conduits. Perioperative mortality was 3% in patients with chronic symptoms and 12% overall. All survivors were symptomatically improved. Mean follow-up was 44 months. Nine-year assisted primary graft patency was 79%, and 5-year patient survival was 61%. Two late deaths occurred in patients with recurrent intestinal ischemia resulting from graft occlusions.\nBypass grafting to the SMA alone appears to be both an effective and durable procedure for treatment of intestinal ischemia. Our results appear equal to those reported for \"complete\" revascularization for intestinal ischemia. When the SMA is a suitable recipient vessel, multiple bypass grafts to other splanchnic vessels are unnecessary in the treatment of intestinal ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive measurements of limb systolic pressures are used routinely in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease, including the evaluation for critical limb ischemia. However, ankle pressures cannot be measured reliably in patients with medial calcification, which is especially common among patients with diabetes. Skin lesions on the toes or previous digital amputations may preclude the measurement of toe pressures. Measurements of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) are not subject to such limitations and were shown to be useful in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Because toe pressure is often used in the evaluation of severity of arterial disease and in the assessment for critical ischemia, we undertook to study whether there is a sufficient correlation between toe pressure and foot SPP that would allow the use of SPP measurements when toe pressures cannot be measured.\nMeasurements were carried out in 85 limbs of 71 patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation for peripheral arterial disease. Diabetes mellitus was present in 43 patients. Each patient had foot SPP and toe pressure measurements. Toe pressures measured with photoplethysmography were correlated with foot SPP measured with laser Doppler scanning.\nThere was a strong linear correlation between SPP and toe pressure (r = 0.87; P <.01). Also, significant correlation was found in both the patients with diabetes and the patients without diabetes (r = 0.85 and 0.93, respectively; P <.01 in both cases).\nWe concluded that SPP measured in the foot correlates well with toe pressure and can be substituted for toe pressure measurement in patients in whom toe pressures cannot be measured.",

Characteristics of recurrent lower extremity vein graft lesions and the patency achieved after multiple revisions have not been emphasized in reports on infrainguinal vein graft stenosis. This study was performed to determine (1) the patency of multiply revised lower extremity vein grafts and (2) the timing, location, and angiographic and duplex features of the recurrent lesions.\nLower extremity vein grafts that were followed in a duplex surveillance protocol and required revisions from January 1990 through December 1998 were identified. All revisions were preceded by angiography. In multiply revised lower extremity vein grafts, the immediate preoperative angiogram and duplex examination findings, as well as the angiogram made before the previous revision and the duplex study done after the previous revision, were reviewed to characterize recurrent lesions at the time of previous and current graft revision. The patencies of grafts undergoing single and multiple revisions were compared.\nA total of 233 lower extremity vein graft revisions were performed; of these, 50 (21%) were repeat revisions. Of grafts requiring more than one revision, 98% were normal on duplex examination after the initial revision. Five-year assisted primary patency of multiply revised grafts (91%) was not different from that of grafts with a single revision (89%; P not significant). Of 60 lesions repaired in the 50 repeat revisions, 29 (48%) were at the previously revised site, and 31 (52%) were at new sites. The time between revisions was less if the same site was revised (11 +/- 2 months) than if a different site required revision (20 +/- 4 months; P <.05). Arteriographic evidence of a minor (< 50% diameter) lesion was present at the time of the initial revision in 23% of cases in which revision of a second site was subsequently required.\nIn our experience, 21% of lower extremity vein grafts requiring initial revision ultimately require additional revisions. Multiply revised lower extremity vein grafts have excellent long-term patency. Lesions occur with equal frequency at the site of prior revision and new sites. Lesions prompting revision at new sites occur significantly later and are infrequently detected on prior imaging studies.",

    "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to determine whether autogenous arterial grafts to distal pedal arteries improve the patency of grafts and limb salvage in patients with end-stage renal disease and nonhealing ischemic wounds and to better define the indications for autogenous arterial grafts.\nA review of consecutive patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing autogenous arterial grafts from 1994 through 1999 was carried out. The setting was a university hospital. All 11 patients with end-stage renal disease and nonhealing, ischemic wounds (stage IV SVS-ISCVS classification) undergoing autogenous arterial grafting from 1994 to 1999 were evaluated. Noninvasive studies confirmed inadequate perfusion pressures in all patients. Pre-bypass arteriography identified no major arteries patent at the level of the malleolus, with reconstitution of only a distal or branch pedal or plantar vessel less than 1 mm in diameter. Five patients with patent tibial vessels to just above the ankle underwent bypass surgery with autogenous arterial grafts alone. Six patients also had proximal occlusive disease that required grafts longer than the autogenous arterial grafts; in each of these six patients, an autogenous vein graft proximal to the autogenous arterial graft was placed through use of a composite technique. Inflow was from the common femoral artery in one patient, the popliteal artery in five patients, and a tibial artery in five patients. Outflow was to the medial plantar artery in five patients, the distal dorsalis pedis artery in three patients, the lateral plantar artery in two patients, and the superficial arch in one patient. The conduit was the subscapular artery in four patients, the deep inferior epigastric artery in four patients, the superficial inferior epigastric artery in two patients, and the radial artery in one patient. The main outcome measures were assisted primary graft patency and functional limb salvage rate.\nFollow-up ranged from 6 to 63 months (mean, 20 months); graft patency was determined by means of duplex scanning. All 11 patients are alive, and nine grafts are patent, including three after revision for graft stenosis. Assisted primary patency was 82% at 3 years. All nine patients with patent grafts remained ambulatory and had healed wounds or limited forefoot amputations.\nAutogenous arterial grafts were effective in treating limb-threatening ischemia in patients with end-stage renal disease and inframalleolar arterial insufficiency. Graft patency and limb salvage rates were higher than those reported for autogenous vein graft in these patients. Autogenous arterial grafting may therefore prove to be an effective alternative to autogenous vein grafting in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Infrainguinal graft surveillance leads to intervention on the basis of duplex-identified stenoses. We have become increasingly concerned about the high frequency with which such revisions are required to maximize graft patency and limb salvage rates. The economic implications of these procedures have not been carefully analyzed or justified.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 155 consecutive autogenous infrainguinal bypass grafts performed for chronic leg ischemia in 141 patients. All patients were enrolled in a prospective surveillance program using color flow duplex imaging. Full economic appraisal (cost analysis, cost-effect analysis, and cost-benefit analysis) was performed for all graft surveillance and limb salvage-related interventions through use of standard accounting and valuation techniques.\nMean follow-up was 27 months. Five-year assisted primary patency (72%) and limb salvage rates (91%) were calculated by means of life table analysis. A total of 61 grafts required 86 revisions. Within 1 year of implantation, 36% of the grafts required revision. During this first year, the mean cost per graft enrolled was $9417. Time intervals after the initial year demonstrated a reduced annual revision rate (6%) and cost ($1725 per graft). The mean 5-year cost of graft maintenance ($16,318) approached that of the initial bypass graft ($19,331). The sum of the initial cost of bypass graft and 5-year graft maintenance cost ($35,649) was similar to the cost of amputation ($36,273). Grafts revised for duplex-detected stenoses (n = 46), in comparison with those revised after thrombosis (n = 15), had an improved 1-year patency (93% vs 57%; P <.01), required fewer amputations (2% vs 33%; P <.01), less frequently required multiple graft revisions (P =.06), and generated fewer expenses (at 12 months after revision, $17,688 vs $45,252, P <.01).\nThe cost associated with graft maintenance is significant, particularly within the first year, and demands consideration. Revision of a duplex-identified stenosis was significantly less costly than revision after graft thrombosis. Compared with the cost of limb amputation, limb salvage-related expenses appear to be justified.",

    "abstract": "A 62-year-old woman had painful facial swelling that progressed to extensive periorbital and perioral edema with loss of vision, hearing, and consciousness. Her past surgical history was significant for right radical neck dissection including internal jugular vein (IJV) resection, laryngectomy, partial esophagectomy, tracheoesophageal fistula repair, and tracheostomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. In addition, the patient had received radiation therapy to the neck. A venogram revealed occlusion of the left IJV. A guidewire from the femoral vein was passed through the occluded segment; however, attempts to introduce an angioplasty balloon failed. A percutaneous basilic vein approach allowed passage of a dilator sheath over a guidewire, thereby enabling Wallstent deployment across the IJV occlusion. A second Wallstent was inserted across a stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein; however, this second stent reoccluded the IJV. Surgical removal of the second Wallstent was required through a segmental claviculectomy and venotomy. Patency was restored in the IJV and the brachiocephalic vein with the return of baseline neurologic function. This case demonstrates a complicated emergent endovascular repair of a life-threatening IJV occlusion that required surgical salvage.",

These included five aortic arch aneurysms, four abdominal aortic aneurysms, and three patent synthetic vascular grafts. The specimens were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)/immunoblot and immunohistochemistry for human plasmin/plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and fibrin degradation product (D-dimer).\nIn the SDS-PAGE/immunoblot, 25- and 27-kd bands appeared specifically in experimental fibrin plates after limited digestion by plasmin and were also recognized in the mural thrombi. The presence of bands at 25 and 27 kd, which were most prominent in sections near the flow surface layer, was consistent with the hypothesis that the mural fibrin was digested by the endogenous plasmin. Apparent immunoreactivity was found at the flow surface of the masses at a thickness of 10 to 400 micrometer suggesting the presence of a plasminogen and tPA-rich layer, with D-dimer as a consequential product of fibrinolysis.\nThe hypothesis that fibrin surfaces in the arterial system acquire fibrinolytic activity because of digestion by circulating endogenous plasmin was confirmed; this may contribute to the antithrombogenicity of these flow surfaces.",

The presence of bands at 25 and 27 kd, which were most prominent in sections near the flow surface layer, was consistent with the hypothesis that the mural fibrin was digested by the endogenous plasmin. Apparent immunoreactivity was found at the flow surface of the masses at a thickness of 10 to 400 micrometer suggesting the presence of a plasminogen and tPA-rich layer, with D-dimer as a consequential product of fibrinolysis.",

    "abstract": "Induced angiogenesis has recently been attempted as a therapeutic modality in patients with occlusive arterial atherosclerotic disease. We investigated the possible role of endogenous opioids in the modulation of angiogenesis.\nChick chorioallantoic membrane was used as an in vivo model to study angiogenesis. Fertilized chick eggs were incubated for 3 days, explanted, and incubated for an additional 2 days. Three-millimeter methylcellulose disks were placed on the surface of the chorioallantoic membrane; each disk contained opioid growth factor ([Met(5)]-enkephalin; 5 microgram), the short-acting opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (5 microgram), opioid growth factor and naloxone together (5 microgram of each), the long-acting opioid antagonist naltrexone (5 microgram), or distilled water (control). A second series of experiments was performed with distilled water, the angiogenic inhibitor retinoic acid (1 microgram), and vascular endothelial growth factor (1 microgram) to further evaluate our model. The developing vasculature was imaged 2 days later with a digital camera and exported to a computer for image analysis. Total number of blood vessels, total vessel length, and mean vessel length were measured within a 100-mm(2) region surrounding each applied disk. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed with antibodies directed against opioid growth factor and its receptor (OGFr).\nOpioid growth factor had a significant inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, both the number of blood vessels and the total vessel length being decreased (by 35% and 20%, respectively) in comparison with control levels (P <.005). The simultaneous addition of naloxone and opioid growth factor had no effect on blood vessel growth, nor did naloxone alone. Chorioallantoic membranes exposed to naltrexone displayed increases of 51% and 24% in blood vessel number and length, respectively, in comparison with control specimens (P <.005). These results indicate that the opioid growth factor effects are receptor mediated and tonically active. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of both opioid growth factor and OGFr within the endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells of the developing chorioallantoic membrane vessel wall. Retinoic acid significantly reduced the number and the total length of blood vessels, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor increased both the number and the length of blood vessels in comparison with the controls (P <.0001). The magnitude of opioid growth factor's effects were comparable to those seen with retinoic acid, whereas inhibition of opioid growth factor with naltrexone induced an increase in total vessel length comparable to that for vascular endothelial growth factor.\nThese results demonstrate for the first time that endogenous opioids modulate in vivo angiogenesis. Opioid growth factor is a tonically active peptide that has a receptor-mediated action in regulating angiogenesis in developing endothelial and mesenchymal vascular cells.",

    "abstract": "Seeding a prosthetic graft with genetically engineered vascular endothelial cells (ECs) has the potential to enhance the graft's antithrombotic properties. However, it has been reported that ECs transduced with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) have very low levels of retention on grafts, probably because of increased proteolytic activity. We examined the retention of human tPA (htPA)-transduced ECs after the cells were seeded onto expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts and implanted into dogs. We also examined the function of secreted htPA in this model.\nCanine jugular venous ECs were transduced with adenoviral vectors encoding htPA (Adex1CAhtPA) and beta-galactosidase (Adex1CALacZ). There was a positive relationship between the percentage of X-gal ECs staining and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of Adex1CALacZ. The level of htPA production in vitro increased with the increasing MOI of Adex1CAhtPA, but decreased gradually 4 days after infection. ECs coinfected with Adex1CAhtPA and Adex1CALacZ (htPAEC) or ECs infected with Adex1CALacZ alone (LacZEC) were seeded onto ePTFE grafts at densities equivalent to confluence to visualize retained ECs in an in vivo flow study. The grafts were implanted into canine carotid arteries and harvested after 5 hours of exposure to blood flow. The harvested grafts showed patchy defects in ECs, most of which were covered with mural thrombi. There was no significant difference in retention between htPAEC (29.3% +/- 8.7%) and LacZEC (19.5% +/- 3. 6%). There was a significant negative correlation between the in vivo EC retention on the grafts and the in vitro cellular passage level of ECs (P =.041; r = -.40). htPAEC produced 210.3 +/- 22.2 ng htPA antigen/10(6) cells per 6 hours in vitro and continued to secrete htPA on the harvested graft.\nWe demonstrated that a large amount of functional htPA was produced by adenovirally modified canine ECs. The results of the in vivo study may suggest that overexpression of tPA has little effect on the short-term retention of early passage ECs seeded onto ePTFE grafts.",

Tissue perfusion and increased neovascularization of the ischemic limb were assessed weekly on the basis of the calf blood pressure ratio for the ischemic/nonischemic limbs, regional blood flow to the skeletal muscles as measured with radioactive microspheres, postmortem angiography, and histology.\nAt weeks 1 and 2 after surgery, animals treated with 1000 microgram of VEGF(165) had a 1.5-fold increase and a 2.5-fold increase, respectively, in the regional blood flow to both the adductor and gastrocnemius muscles of the ischemic limb. The blood pressure ratio was also greater in the treated animals than in the controls at weeks 2 and 3 after surgery. Early neovascularization in the VEGF(165) group was further documented at week 1 after surgery by more angiographically recognizable collateral vessels (angioscores were 64.13 +/- 2.51 and 38.28 +/- 3.82 for VEGF(165) and saline solution, respectively; P <.001) and by a threefold increase in the number of capillaries (vascular density) relative to the controls (P <.005).\nIntramuscular administration of a single dose of plasmid-liposomes encoding for VEGF(165) accelerates angiogenesis and increases blood flow in the rabbit hindlimb ischemic model. Therefore, this nonviral vector could be recommended for further testing for use in therapeutic angiogenesis.",

Angiography was used when the ankle-arm index was less than 0.8; venography was used when venous reflux was detectable by means of a hand-held Doppler examination. Therapies included percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (seven patients), femoropopliteal bypass grafting surgery (one patient), saphenectomy of the greater saphenous vein (six patients), and split skin graft (11 patients).\nAll patients with rheumatoid arthritis exhibited a multifactorial etiology of their ulcers: four of nine patients had peripheral arterial disease, and five of nine patients had venous insufficiency. In one of these patients, arterial and venous disease was combined. Five of six patients with systemic sclerosis exhibited a multifactorial etiology of their ulcers: three of six patients had peripheral arterial disease, and three of six patients had venous insufficiency. One of these patients had both arterial and venous disease. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, healing was achieved in six of nine patients, and marked improvement occurred in two of nine patients. A below-knee amputation was necessary in one patient with rheumatoid vasculitis. In patients with systemic sclerosis, healing was achieved in three of six patients, and marked improvement occurred in the other three patients.\nMost leg ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis disclose a multifactorial etiology. Relevant arterial and venous disease can be found in approximately half the patients. Our study suggests that revascularization and vein surgery improve the healing of leg ulcers in patients with collagen vascular disease. A prospective trial is now required to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term functional results after medial claviculectomy and venous patch angioplasty or bypass grafting using internal jugular vein after incomplete thrombolysis of effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein.\nThe records of 11 patients with effort thrombosis who were treated over the past 9 years were reviewed. Patients have been followed up between 3 and 9 years at 6-month intervals with duplex imaging and contrast venography when indicated and have had an orthopedic evaluation of their shoulder function.\nAll reconstructed veins are patent, and only one patient complains of any arm swelling after prolonged usage. This patient is one of three with postphlebitic changes at the site of repair and has similar findings in her basilic vein. All patients have returned to their prethrombosis vocation without limitation. Four of the 11 patients have jobs requiring heavy physical labor. No patient describes any limitations of shoulder function, but one man who works as a diesel mechanic complains of shoulder aching with overuse with repetitive pulling. Three patients describe upper extremity paresthesias when lying on the operated side. Two patients (one man and one woman) are bothered by the large scar and indentation at the site of the incision. Every patient considers the overall result completely successful from a functional standpoint.\nEarly subclavian venous repair performed through a medial claviculectomy is a durable operation with excellent long-term functional results. Half of the patients noted minor but significant symptoms, but all are uniformly able to return to normal function.",

    "abstract": "Techniques for managing the distal anastomoses of aortofemoral and iliofemoral endovascular grafts are described.\nOver a 2(1/2)-year period 46 endovascular grafts were successfully placed to treat severe iliac artery occlusive disease. Endovascular grafts were anchored proximally in the distal aorta or iliac arteries with Palmaz balloon-expandable stents. The distal anastomoses were performed with the use of open, sutured anastomotic techniques. In contrast to stented distal anastomoses, these techniques allowed us to (1) treat occlusive lesions extending from the distal aorta to below the inguinal ligament, (2) terminate endovascular grafts in the groin where stents are contraindicated, (3) vary the distal anastomotic site depending on the local pattern of disease, and (4) standardize the preinsertion length of the endovascular graft.\nTwo distal perianastomotic stenoses and one graft occlusion were detected postoperatively in 11 bypass grafts that had distal anastomoses sewn endoluminally without an overlying patch angioplasty. Only one perianastomotic stenosis was found among 35 anastomoses performed with other techniques. There were no significant differences in primary and secondary patency between grafts originating in the distal aorta or iliac arteries.\nHand-sewn distal anastomoses can simplify the insertion of endovascular grafts used for the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. These anastomoses permit tailoring of the graft according to the patients' pattern of disease and eliminate the need to precisely measure the length of the graft preoperatively. In addition, because a distal stent is not required, endovascular grafts can be safely terminated in the groin instead of the external iliac artery where disease progression can lead to graft failure. Finally, endovascular distal anastomoses should be closed with a patch or the hood of a more distal bypass graft to prevent perianastomotic stenoses or occlusions in the postoperative period.",

Consecutive patients with ICA occlusion were eligible for the study. Between 1990 and 1991, 41 such patients were identified at our center. All patients were observed prospectively for a mean of 44.5 months, except for one patient who was lost to follow-up after 12 months. Patients with severe (ie, more than 75%) stenosis of the contralateral internal carotid artery were scheduled for thromboendarterectomy. ICA occlusion was objectively documented in all patients by using a combination of echo-color Doppler scanning and continuous-wave Doppler scanning (periorbital flow).\nThe overall mortality rate was 22.0% (95% CI, 10.6-37.6), and the stroke-related mortality rate was 7.3% (95% CI, 1.5-19.9). No differences in overall and stroke-related mortality rates were observed between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. None of the patients experienced nonfatal cerebrovascular events.\nICA occlusion seems to represent a relatively benign condition, in both its symptomatic and asymptomatic presentation.

    "abstract": "Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is currently being investigated with respect to its effect on distal arterial volume flow in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Recently published data have shown a substantial acute enhancement in arterial calf inflow in response to IPC of the lower limb in both intermittent claudication and leg ischemia.\nThe aim of the study was to compare the immediate effects of intermittent pneumatic foot (IPC(foot)) versus calf (IPC(calf)) versus simultaneous foot and calf compression (IPC(foot+calf)) on popliteal artery hemodynamics in patients with intermittent claudication (Fontaine II) and in normal subjects, using duplex ultrasonography. For this purpose, 25 limbs of 20 healthy subjects (age range [mean], 51-74 [64] years) and 31 limbs of 25 claudicants (age range [mean], 56-81 [66.5] years; resting ankle-brachial indices, 0.38-0.75 [0.55]) were examined in the sitting position with and without IPC compression.\nMean popliteal artery flow in healthy subjects increased by 98.8% on application of IPC(foot), 188% with IPC(calf), and 274% with IPC(foot+calf) (all P <.001). Mean flow in claudicants increased by 58% on application of IPC(foot), 132% with IPC(calf), and 174% with IPC(foot+calf) (all P <.001). The mean velocity, peak systolic velocity, and end diastolic velocity displayed a pattern of change similar to that for volume flow in both groups. Pulsatility index decreased in both groups on application of IPC; the lowest values were generated with IPC(foot+calf).\nOf the three compression modes investigated, IPC(foot+calf) was the most effective means of acutely augmenting arterial calf inflow in arteriopaths and normals. The significant increase in end diastolic velocity and decrease in pulsatility index indicate that peripheral vasodilatation is the central mechanism in this impulse-related flow augmentation. Prospective trials are indicated to determine the clinical potential of the long-term effects of IPC(foot+calf) in patients with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite many clinical studies, there is still uncertainty as to whether venous material is superior to polytetrafluoroethylene for femoropopliteal reconstruction proximal to the knee joint. Supported by early satisfactory results with thin-walled, stretched polytetrafluoroethylene for suprageniculate bypass grafts, a prospectively randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of reversed saphenous vein in comparison with that of polytetrafluoroethylene in above-knee arterial reconstruction.\nIn a 3-year period, 151 above-knee femoropopliteal bypass graft operations were performed in 136 patients (77 male, 59 female). The indication for operation was severe claudication in 120 cases, rest pain in 20 cases, and ulceration in 11 cases. For the bypass graft, a reversed saphenous vein was used in each of 75 cases, and a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis was used in each of 76 cases. Preoperative risk factors were diabetes (24%), a history of myocardial infarction (23%), and current status with respect to smoking (74%). There was no hospital mortality; 5% of patients had minor postoperative complications.\nAfter 2 years, the primary patency was 83% for saphenous vein and 67% for polytetrafluoroethylene (P =.065); the secondary patency was 83% for saphenous vein and 77% for polytetrafluoroethylene (P =.298). During a follow-up period of 2 years, we found no statistically significant difference in primary and secondary patency between saphenous vein and polytetrafluoroethylene. We found no predictive factor for occlusion of either bypass graft.\nThe use of polytetrafluoroethylene above the knee is a reasonable alternative in femoropopliteal bypass grafting that is associated with acceptable short-term patency rates.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the choice of a vascular prosthesis for a femoral-popliteal above-knee arterial bypass graft is left to the surgeon's preference, because the available information on comparative evaluations is inconclusive. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study 141 was established to identify whether improved patency exists with different bypass graft materials for patients with femoral-popliteal above-knee bypass grafts.\nBetween June 1983 and June 1988, 752 patients at 20 VA medical centers were randomized to receive either an externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; N = 265), human umbilical vein (HUV; N = 261), or saphenous vein (SV; N = 226) for an above-knee femoral-popliteal bypass graft. The indication for the bypass grafting operation was limb salvage in 67.5% of the patients. Patients were observed every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter. All patients were instructed to take aspirin (650 mg) daily for the duration of the study.Doppler-derived ankle-brachial indices (ABIs) were determined preoperatively and serially postoperatively. A bypass graft was considered to be patent when the Doppler-derived postoperative ABI remained significantly improved (more than 0.15 units higher than their preoperative value) and additional objective information, such as angiograms or operations, did not contradict these observations. Patency failure also included bypass grafts that were removed because of an infection or aneurysmal degeneration. Patency rates were compared by using the Kaplan-Meier life table analysis.\nThe cumulative assisted primary patency rates were statistically similar among the different conduit types at 2 years (SV, 81%; HUV, 70%; PTFE, 69%). After 5 years, above-knee SV bypass grafts had a significantly (P </=.01) better patency rate (73%) than HUV bypass grafts (53%), which had a significantly (P </=.01) better patency rate than PTFE bypass grafts (39%). Limb salvage was slightly worse with PTFE conduits. The number of bypass graft thromboses and major amputations within the first 30 days was highest in the HUV group.\nThe overall results of this prospective randomized study suggest that the SV should be considered as the bypass graft of choice for femoral-popliteal above-knee reconstruction and that, when a prosthetic bypass graft is used, an HUV should also be considered as an alternative choice to PTFE.",

Case notes were reviewed for patients who were admitted but not operated on. Operative mortality was defined as death within the same hospital admission. Long-term survival data were obtained from the General Register Office (GRO1 records) through record linkage by the Information and Statistics Division of the National Health Service of Scotland.\nA total of 542 men (78%; median age, 72 years; age range, 46-93 years) and 150 women (22%; median age, 74 years; age range, 55-93 years) were admitted with RAAA (P =.12; Mann-Whitney U test). There was no significant difference in perioperative mortality between men and women. Although women who were not operated on (median age, 81 years; age range, 68-93 years) were significantly (P =.005) older than men who were not operated on (median age, 77 years; age range, 54-93 years), for any given age group, women appeared less likely than men to be offered surgical repair. Long-term survival after successful repair was comparable for the genders.\nGender has no influence on either short-term or long-term outcome for patients undergoing operative repair of RAAA. However, women are less likely to be selected for operation than their male counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Although advances in technology have reduced the operative risk of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, the surgical repair of ruptured AAAs is associated with a much poorer prognosis and a higher cost. Accordingly, it has been suggested that patients with predictably high rates of morbidity and mortality from ruptured AAA may not benefit from surgical intervention.\nA cost-effectiveness analysis was performed with the use of a Markov decision-analytic model to compute long-term survival in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients with ruptured AAAs managed with either a strategy of open surgical repair or no intervention. Probability estimates for the various outcomes were based on a review of the literature. Average costs of (1) the immediate hospitalization ($28,356) and (2) complications resulting from the procedure were based on the average use of resources as reported in the literature and from a hospital's cost accounting system. Our measure of outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. For our base-case analysis, the repair of ruptured AAAs was cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,754. (Society is usually willing to pay for interventions with cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $60,000; for example, the costeffectiveness ratios for coronary artery bypass grafting and dialysis are $9500 and $54,400, respectively.) In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness of repairing ruptured AAAs was influenced only by alterations in the operative mortality. If the operative mortality exceeded 88%, repair of ruptured AAAs was no longer cost-effective. As an independent variable, increasing age had no substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness, although it is reported to be associated with increased operative mortality. It was necessary that the patient's cost of the initial hospitalization for ruptured AAA exceed $195,000 before repairing ruptured AAAs was no longer cost-effective.\nOur analysis suggests that despite the high cost and poor outcomes, the surgical repair of ruptured AAAs is still cost-effective when compared with no intervention. The cost of repairing ruptured AAAs falls within society's acceptable limits and therefore should not be a consideration in the management of patients with AAAs.",

    "abstract": "To determine the nature of and to compare the inflammatory responses induced by (1) endovascular and (2) conventional abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nTwelve consecutive patients undergoing elective infrarenal AAA repair were prospectively studied. Seven patients were selected for endovascular procedures (the EAAA group); five patients underwent open surgery (the OAAA group). Three control patients undergoing carotid thromboendarterectomy were also included. Serial peripheral venous blood samples were collected preoperatively, immediately after declamping or placement of the endograft, and at hours 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72. Acute phase response expression of peripheral T lymphocyte and monocyte activation markers and adhesion molecules (flow cytometry), soluble levels of cell adhesion molecules (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8) release (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and liberation of complement products (nephelometry) were measured.\nRegarding acute phase response, the EAAA and OAAA groups showed significant increases in C-reactive protein (P <.001 and P =.001), body temperature (P =.035 and P =.048), and leukocyte count (P <.001 and P <.001). Similar time course patterns were observed with respect to body temperature (P =.372). Statistically significant different patterns were demonstrated for C-reactive protein (P =.032) and leukocyte count (P =.002). Regarding leukocyte activation, a significant upregulation of peripheral T lymphocyte CD38 expression was observed in the OAAA group only (P =.001). Analysis of markers such as CD69, CD40L, CD25, and CD54 revealed no perioperative fluctuations in any group. Regarding circulating cell adhesion molecules, the EAAA and OAAA groups displayed significant increases in soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (P =.003 and P =.001); there was no intergroup difference (P =.193). All groups demonstrated high soluble von Willebrand factor levels (P =.018, P =. 007, and P =.027), there being no differences in the patterns (P =. 772). Otherwise, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-selectin, and soluble P-selectin did not appear to vary in any group. Regarding cytokine release, although a tendency toward high tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-8 levels was noticed in the EAAA group, global time course effects failed to reach statistical significance (P =.543 and P =.080). In contrast, interleukin-6 showed elevations in all groups (P =.058, P <.001, and P =.004). Time course patterns did not differ between the EAAA and OAAA groups (P =.840). Regarding complement activation, the C3d/C3 ratio disclosed significant postoperative elevations in the EAAA and OAAA groups (P =.013 and P =.009). This complement product release was reduced in the EAAA group (P <.001).\nThe current study indicated that both endovascular and coventional AAA repair induced significant inflammatory responses. Our findings showed that there were no large differences between the procedures with respect to circulating cell adhesion molecule and cytokine release. Moreover, the endoluminal approach produced a limited response in terms of acute phase reaction, T lymphocyte activation, and complement product liberation. This might support the concept that endovascular AAA repair represents an attractive alternative to open surgery. Given the relatively small sample size, further larger studies are required for confirmation of our observations.",

All groups demonstrated high soluble von Willebrand factor levels (P =.018, P =. 007, and P =.027), there being no differences in the patterns (P =. 772). Otherwise, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-selectin, and soluble P-selectin did not appear to vary in any group. Regarding cytokine release, although a tendency toward high tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-8 levels was noticed in the EAAA group, global time course effects failed to reach statistical significance (P =.543 and P =.080). In contrast, interleukin-6 showed elevations in all groups (P =.058, P <.001, and P =.004). Time course patterns did not differ between the EAAA and OAAA groups (P =.840). Regarding complement activation, the C3d/C3 ratio disclosed significant postoperative elevations in the EAAA and OAAA groups (P =.013 and P =.009). This complement product release was reduced in the EAAA group (P <.001).",

    "abstract": "The technical elements and early results of laparoscopic-assisted abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy are described.\nFrom February 1997 to May 1999, 60 patients underwent elective laparoscopic surgery for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Patients ranged in age from 53 to 87 years (mean age, 70.6 years). The mean aneurysm size was 5.7 cm (range, 4.4-8.0 cm). All patients underwent aortography and computed tomography scanning preoperatively. Patients were not deemed candidates for the procedure when visceral arterial abnormalities requiring surgical treatment were present or an aortic aneurysm neck shorter than 0.5 cm was found. A risk-stratification system was used as a means of quantitating risk factors and excluding high-risk patients. Aortic reconstruction was performed with retroperitoneal laparoscopy, with the patient in a modified right lateral decubitus position. An Endo TA 30 and an Endo TA 60 laparoscopic staplers (US Surgical, Norwalk, Conn) were used in occluding the common iliac arteries and aneurysm sac. Laparoscopic hemoclips were used as a means of occluding the lumbar arteries and other branches of the aneurysm sac. An aortobifemoral or aortobi-iliac bypass grafting procedure was performed by means of the laparoscope to position the graft and visualize the end-to-end aorta-to-graft anastomosis, with distal anastomoses performed through counter incisions.\nThree patients died within 30 days of surgery (mortality rate, 5.0%). Complications included left ureteral injury (1), postoperative myocardial infarction (1), ileofemoral deep venous thrombosis (1), acute renal failure (2), colon ischemia (1), and infected graft limb requiring revision (1). The mean operative time was 7.7 hours, and the mean aortic cross-clamping time was 112 minutes. Compared with a contemporary consecutive series of 100 patients undergoing open transabdominal or retroperitoneal aneurysmectomy performed by the same group of surgeons, the laparoscopic patients had decreased length of stays in the intensive care unit and the hospital, with less need for ventilator support, earlier resumption of a regular diet, and an earlier return to normal activity. At the follow-up examinations, all bypass grafts were patent.\nLaparoscopic-assisted aneurysmectomy is safe and effective and can be performed with good results. The longer operation time required is well tolerated in patients who are at good and moderate risk. Prior training in laparoscopic aortic surgery is necessary for surgeons to obtain the required level of expertise needed to perform these procedures. With these caveats, the results of our study suggest that laparoscopic-assisted aortic aneurysmectomy is appropriate for moderate-to-good risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists class of III or lower) operative candidates meeting standard criteria for aneurysm resection in whom preoperative computed tomography scan and biplane arteriography demonstrate a proximal aneurysm neck of 0.5 cm or larger and no need for visceral or internal iliac artery reconstruction. A randomized trial would be required to confirm the benefits of this procedure over open aneurysmectomy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the midline retroperitoneal approach with the midline transperitoneal approach for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with respect to operative details, gastrointestinal complications, and wound complications.\nFrom January 1990 through January 1998, 128 patients underwent elective aortic reconstruction for infrarenal AAA. Of these, 64 patients (the transperitoneal group) underwent conventional transperitoneal midline aortic exposure, whereas the remaining 64 patients (the retroperitoneal group) underwent retroperitoneal midline exposure of the aneurysm.\nPreclamp time, that is, the time from skin incision to aortic clamping, was significantly shorter in the transperitoneal group than in the retroperitoneal group (P <.001). However, the midline retroperitoneal approach was associated with decreased incidence of ileus (P <.01), earlier resumption of oral intake (P <.01), and decreased wound pain (P <.01), in comparison with the transperitoneal approach. Furthermore, there was no incidence of wound complications such as abdominal bulge or wound pain in any of the patients in the postoperative period or over the long term.\nThe midline retroperitoneal approach for AAA was associated with fewer postoperative gastrointestinal and wound complications than the midline transperitoneal approach. Over the long term, there was no wound complication such as abdominal bulge and wound pain in any of the patients.",

    "abstract": "The saphenous vein is among the most commonly used conduits for renal artery revascularization in adults. Vein grafts are more durable in the renal artery bed than in coronary and peripheral beds, and mechanisms of potential graft failure vary. Coronary vein grafts often fail because of atherosclerotic degeneration, whereas lower extremity grafts fail because of intimal hyperplasia or progression of underlying disease. In contrast, renal vein grafts may dilate over time but seldom fail. This may relate to the distinct hemodynamic environment of the renal bed with low-resistance, high-velocity blood flow. However, frank aneurysmal degeneration of renal vein grafts is rare with only a single report of rupture in the literature. We report an additional case of rupture of a late graft aneurysm and review the literature and our own experience with renal revascularization to underscore the rarity of this serious complication. The saphenous vein for aortorenal bypass grafting continues to be a favorable conduit for renal revascularization. Long-term duplex ultrasound scanning follow-up is recommended to survey the reconstructed artery and perhaps more important, to evaluate progression of subclinical disease in the contralateral renal artery.",

A second patient had a large subclavian pseudoaneurysm 4 months after a balloon-expandable stent placement. Successful repair was achieved in this patient by means of arterial reconstruction with a prosthetic bypass graft.

Two of the original operations had been done elsewhere, but the six patients who were collected from our own series represented 0.5% of the 1258 carotid endarterectomies we performed and 1.8% of the 340 synthetic carotid patches we applied without any comparable infections among another 918 patients who received either vein patch angioplasty (n = 843) or primary arteriotomy closure (n = 74) during the same 4-year study period. With a single exception (\"no growth\"), bacterial cultures that were obtained at the time of the eight reoperations revealed Staphylococcus (n = 4) or Streptococcus (n = 3) species. All of the infected Dacron patches were removed and were replaced with saphenous vein patches (n = 5) or interposition grafts (n = 3), after which appropriate oral (n = 2) or intravenous (n = 6) antibiotics were administered for 2 to 6 weeks. No postoperative deaths occurred, but there were 2 temporary cranial nerve injuries, 1 myocardial infarction, and 1 stroke that was related to preoperative angiography. A recurrent carotid infection has not developed in any of the eight patients during a mean follow-up interval of 16 months (range, 3-36 months).",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells line the vasculature and are exposed to mechanical shear stress because of blood motion. Previous studies have shown that endothelial cells respond to shear stress by altering their metabolism and genetic expression, but the mechanism for shear stress signal transduction remains unclear. In the current study, we investigated the role of intracellular Ca(2+) increases as a part of the shear stress signal transduction cascade. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye fura-2 and exposed to fluid flow in a parallel plate flow chamber in the presence of the inflammatory mediator histamine or the proteolytic enzyme thrombin. The initiation of shear stress (in the range of 0.2-20 dyne/cm(2)) in the absence of either agonist caused no increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels. Cells exposed to either histamine (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/l) or thrombin (0.02-0.2 u/ml) showed an intracellular calcium increase (20-150 nmol/L) that was dependent on the magnitude of the shear stress and on the concentration of agonist. In cells exposed to histamine and shear stress, the magnitude of the intracellular calcium increase was not altered, except at 10(-7) mol/L histamine. The time course of the response was significantly faster for arterial than for venous levels of shear stress at histamine concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L. The magnitude of the [Ca(2+)](i) response was dependent on both the magnitude of the shear stress and the concentration of thrombin. At a thrombin concentration of 0.2 U/mL, the increase in intracellular Ca(2+) was significantly greater at arterial levels of shear stress (6-20 dyne/cm(2)) than at venous levels of shear stress (0.2-1 dyne/cm(2)). Because we solved the governing mass balance equation to precisely determine the effect of flow on local agonist concentration, the alterations in the [Ca(2+)](i) response were not due to differences in mass transfer characteristics. These results demonstrate that even in a system in which the initiation of shear stress without agonist causes no detectable change in intracellular Ca(2+), the calcium response to agonists is changed, which suggests that the signal transduction pathway for shear stress acts synergistically with the thrombin and histamine signal transduction pathways.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent smooth muscle cell mitogen implicated in the development of intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. A regional variation in canine aortic production of PDGF (greater in the distal than in the proximal aorta) was demonstrated previously in organ culture. The response of aortic segments in organ culture, as well as of aortic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, to stimulators of PDGF secretion-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and thrombin-was assessed to elucidate whether these regional variations were due to intrinsic differences in the abilities of cells to produce PDGF.\nProximal and distal aortic segments were removed from 10 dogs and placed in organ culture, then treated with PMA or thrombin for 72 hours. PDGF in the conditioned media was measured by radioreceptor assay.\nPDGF production in the distal, unstimulated aorta was 2.5-fold higher than that in the proximal aorta (P <.05). Treatment of the proximal aorta with 10 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L PMA increased PDGF production twofold and threefold, respectively, whereas no increase with PMA treatment was seen in the distal aorta. After thrombin treatment, no increase in PDGF production was noted in the proximal aorta and only a minimal increase was noted in the distal aorta. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (n = 6) were cultured from four aortic segments (ascending thoracic, descending thoracic, abdominal, and infrarenal) and treated with PMA. PDGF production by unstimulated endothelial cells from the infrarenal aorta was 2.5-fold higher (P <.01) than that from the ascending thoracic aorta. With PMA treatment, PDGF secretion increased in endothelial cells from all segments, the greatest percentage increase being observed in the proximal segments. Thrombin also increased PDGF release from endothelial cells, but with no regional variation. Unstimulated smooth muscle cells did not exhibit regional variation in PDGF production and did not increase PDGF secretion after treatment with PMA or thrombin.\nThese findings suggest that endothelial cells in the aorta may have a differential capacity to produce PDGF in response to stimulants, reflecting intrinsic differences in endothelial cells from the proximal aorta versus the distal aorta, and this may account in part for the propensity of the distal aorta to develop atherosclerosis.",

The aim of this study was to examine MMP-2 production and expression by aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nAortic SMCs and dermal fibroblasts were cultured from patients with AAAs or from age-matched controls with atherosclerosis. The production of MMP and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase into culture media was analyzed with the use of gelatin zymography, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene expression was analyzed with Northern blotting.\nAll cells studied constitutively produced MMP-2. Aortic SMCs cultured from aneurysmal tissue expressed MMP-2 protein and messenger RNA at a significantly higher level than SMCs from controls (P =.008). Dermal fibroblasts from patients with AAAs expressed MMP-2 at a similar level to controls. In both cell types, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and membrane type 1-MMP were expressed at similar levels.\nThese data suggested that the regulation of MMP-2 gene expression was altered in the aortic SMCs of patients with aneurysms, but this finding was not repeated in other mesenchymal tissue.",

    "abstract": "Patients who require angioplasty and stenting of multiple iliac arterial segments often require reintervention to maintain long-term patency. Morphologic predictors and causes of failure are unknown. The purpose of the current study was to define arteriographic predictors of angioplasty and selective stent failure in the treatment of multisegment iliac occlusive disease.\nAll iliac segments (two common and two external) of 75 patients who underwent angioplasty and selective stent placement for multisegment iliac occlusive disease (>/= two segments) were scored through use of a modification of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology classification for iliac angioplasty (0 = no lesion; 4 = most severe). Total iliac score was calculated by summing scores from each segment. A separate external iliac score was calculated by adding only the external iliac scores. Arteriograms were reviewed initially and at the time of lesion recurrence and stratified by lesion location and previous intervention.\nThe area of previous endovascular intervention was the site of recurrence in 75% of patients. New lesions, presumably a result of progressive atherosclerosis, occurred in 15% of patients, and lesions occurred in both new and previously treated iliac segments in 10% of patients. Only the external iliac score was an independent predictor of failed endovascular therapy despite reintervention. For patients with an external iliac score of 2 or less, the endovascular primary-assisted patency rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were 96%, 92%, and 89%, respectively. This was improved in comparison with the 90%, 63%, and 45% patency rates observed in patients with an external iliac score of 3 or more (P =.001). Patients with an external iliac score of 3 or more had a significantly lower incidence of hemodynamic and clinical improvement after intervention and a threefold higher need for surgical inflow procedures than patients with an external iliac score of 2 or less.\nLesion formation after treatment of multisegment iliac occlusive disease typically occurs in areas of prior intervention. The extent of external iliac disease can be used to stratify patients with multisegment iliac occlusive disease who will likely respond to endovascular treatment with a durable result. Patients with extensive external iliac disease (score >/= 3) have poor results after angioplasty and selective stenting as applied in this study, even with endovascular reintervention. They are ideal subjects for prospective comparative studies of competing initial therapies, including stenting, endografting, and aortobifemoral bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "An elevated plasma level of lipoprotein (a) is an independent risk factor for atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease by yet undefined mechanisms. We have previously reported that matrix metalloproteinases cleave apolipoprotein (a) into 2 main fragments, F1 and F2, the latter (the C-terminal domain) exhibiting in vitro a high-affinity binding to extracellular matrix components, including fibrin(ogen). We therefore tested the hypothesis that the lipoprotein (a) matrix metalloproteinase-derived F2 is localized in potentially or morphologically unstable human carotid plaque at regions of increased matrix metalloproteinase activity.\nCarotid plaques removed after endarterectomy (n = 18) were evaluated for structural features indicative of instability (thin fibrous cap, inflammation, and proximity of the necrotic core to the lumen); each plaque was classified as unstable (n = 10) or stable (n = 8). Western blot analysis was performed to quantitate apolipoprotein (a) and its fragments F1 and F2 in plaque extracts. Immunohistochemical staining was used to localize apolipoprotein (a) and its fragments within the atherosclerotic plaque. In situ zymography was used to determine regions of gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9) activity.\nWestern blot analyses demonstrated a 2.5-fold higher density of F2 in unstable plaques than in stable plaques (3.07 +/- 1.9 vs 1.18 +/- 0.8; P <.05). In morphologically unstable plaques, there was preferential distribution of F2 within regions of fibrous cap inflammation and/or foam cell accumulation and within abluminal necrotic cores. In morphologically stable plaques, however, localization was predominantly found in the medial smooth muscle cells. Regions of enhanced matrix metalloproteinase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity co-localized with the transmural distribution of F2 within the plaque.\nThese findings suggest that F2 in regions of increased matrix metalloproteinase activity is a potential mechanism for superimposed thrombotic events in morphologically unstable human carotid plaques. The relationship between plasma lipoprotein (a) levels and accumulation of F2 and the potential correlation of F2 to human plaque disruption and thrombosis warrant further study.",

We therefore examined our carotid registry to identify risk factors associated with postoperative length of stay exceeding 1 day.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy at our academic center from May 1996 through April 1999. Combined procedures and patients undergoing subsequent noncarotid-related procedures on those admissions were excluded. The charts were inspected for atherosclerosis risk factors, including sex and age, specific attending surgeon, side of the surgery, use of intravenous vasoactive drugs, actual preoperative blood pressure, and presence of neurologic symptoms or postoperative complications. Multiple regression analysis was performed on all collected variables. Statistical significance was inferred for P less than.05.\nA total of 188 patients met the study criteria and had complete, retrievable medical records. A mean postoperative length of stay of 1.65 +/- 0.08 days and a mean total length of stay of 2.17 +/- 0.14 days were observed. Fifty-seven percent of patients went home the day after surgery. There was a 1.6% stroke-mortality rate. Significant predictors of a prolonged stay, listed in order of decreasing importance on the basis of their calculated contribution to prolonging the postoperative length of stay, are as follows (P value; beta coefficient): postoperative complications (<.0001; 1.03), age > 79 years (.008; 0.547), diabetes mellitus (.011; 0.407), female sex (.007; 0.398), and intravenous vasodilator requirement (. 035; 0.382). Other atherosclerosis risk factors, prior neurologic symptoms, the postoperative use of vasopressors, and reoperative surgery did not contribute to extended length of stay.\nDischarge on the first postoperative day is feasible in many, but not all, patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Our data help define subsets of patients at risk for prolonged postoperative stay. Targeting these subsets for preoperative medical and social interventions may allow safe early discharge more frequently.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an association between elevated sex hormones (ie, serum estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG], testosterone) and increased venous distension and clinical evidence of varicose veins in menopausal women.\nParticipants were 104 healthy volunteer menopausal women, aged 48 to 65 years, who were not undergoing hormonal treatment. Of these 104, 14 were excluded from analyses because their estradiol levels were compatible with a premenopausal condition (4), because they had missing values for insulin concentration (5), and because they did not show up at venous vessel examination (5). Patients underwent a physical examination to determine the presence of varicose veins; a venous strain-gauge plethysmographic examination to compute instrumental measures of venous distensibility; and laboratory analyses of blood so serum testosterone, estradiol, SHBG, glucose, and insulin could be measured. There were also prevalence ratios and odds ratios used to test the presence of an association between biochemical and instrumental variables.\nSerum levels of estradiol in the upper tertile of the frequency distribution were significantly associated with clinical evidence of varicose veins (prevalence odds ratios 3.6; 95% CI 1.1-11.6) and with increased lower limb venous distensibility (prevalence odds ratios 4.4; 95% CI 1.2-15.5). No association was found for SHBG and testosterone.\nOur finding that high serum levels of estradiol are associated with clinical evidence of varicose veins and instrumental measurements indicating increased venous distensibility in menopausal women suggests that endogenous estrogens may play a role in the development of this very common venous vessel abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "External pneumatic compression (EPC) devices prevent lower extremity deep venous thrombosis by increasing venous flow and thereby reducing stasis. Early studies suggested that they also enhance systemic fibrinolytic activity and thus prevent thrombus formation; more recent studies have been conflicting. The hypothesis of this study was that EPC devices enhance systemic fibrinolysis or reduce postoperative fibrinolytic impairment in patients undergoing abdominal surgical procedures.\nEach of 48 patients (98% male; mean age, 67 years) undergoing major intra-abdominal surgical procedures (36 bowel procedures, 12 aortic reconstructions) was prospectively randomized to one of three treatments for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin injections (HEP group), use of a thigh-length sequential EPC device (EPC group), or both (HEP + EPC group). Antecubital venous samples were collected for measurement of systemic fibrinolytic activity on the day before surgery, after induction of anesthesia but before prophylaxis was initiated, and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5. Fibrinolysis was assessed through measurement of the activities of the rate limiting fibrinolytic activator, tissue plasminogen activator, and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with amidolytic methods.\nOn the day before surgery, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity was elevated in all groups in comparison with that in age-matched and sex-matched controls (20.3 +/- 0.6 AU/mL). In the HEP group, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity was further elevated above the value for the day before surgery on postoperative day 1 (28.5 +/- 4.3 AU/mL; P =.04) and postoperative day 3 (25.1 +/- 1.9 AU/mL; P =.07). No significant decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity occurred in either group treated with EPC devices in comparison with the HEP group at any time. There were no changes in tissue plasminogen activator activity postoperatively in the HEP group and no significant increases in either EPC group at any point.\nReduced systemic fibrinolytic activity (\"fibrinolytic shutdown\") occurred in these patients after abdominal surgery; it was manifested as increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity. EPC devices did not enhance systemic fibrinolysis or prevent postoperative shutdown either by decreasing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity or by increasing tissue plasminogen activator activity. These data suggest that EPC devices do not prevent deep venous thrombosis by fibrinolytic enhancement; effective prophylaxis is achieved only when the devices are used in a manner that reduces lower extremity venous stasis.",

    "abstract": "In vitro studies have recently demonstrated that homocysteine interacts with the aortic wall by inducing both elastolysis and endothelial perturbation. The aim of this study was to evaluate homocysteine plasma levels and their relationships with aortic diameter and endothelial damage in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nFifty-eight consecutive male patients (mean age, 69.5 +/- 6.6 years; age range, 49-78 years) who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery were enrolled in the study. Twenty-two of 58 patients had no clinical or instrumental evidence of atherosclerosis. Sixty control subjects were age matched and sex matched with the patients. In all of the subjects, we evaluated total homocysteine and thrombomodulin plasma levels and the distribution of the C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutation.\nHyperhomocysteinemia was found in 26 (48%) of the 58 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, and homocysteine plasma levels were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (15.7 +/- 6.5 micromol/L vs 9.6 +/- 3.9 micromol/L; P <. 0001). In addition, the subgroup of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm who did not show evidence of atherosclerosis showed homocysteine plasma levels significantly higher than those in the controls (14.8 +/- 6.1 micromol/L vs 9.6 +/- 3.9 micromol/L; P <. 001). A larger aneurysmal size was detected in hyperhomocysteinemic patients than in those with normal homocysteine plasma levels (5.09 +/- 0.84 cm vs 5.79 +/- 1.5 cm; P <.05). The genotype distribution of the C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation was as follows: TT 21%, TC 55%, and CC 24% in the patients; TT 10%, TC 58%, and CC 32% in the controls. Moreover, in patients a significant correlation (P <.005) between homocysteine plasma level and 677TT methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype was found. Thrombomodulin plasma levels were significantly higher (P <.00005) in patients (median, 30 ng/mL; range, 10-164 ng/mL) than in controls (median, 19 ng/mL; range, 13-44 ng/mL), and thrombomodulin levels were significantly higher (P <.005) in hyperhomocysteinemic patients (median, 39.5 ng/mL; range, 15-164 ng/mL) than in normohomocysteinemic patients (median, 27.5 ng/mL; range, 10-85 ng/mL). In addition, in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, a direct significant correlation (P <.005) was found between homocysteine and thrombomodulin.\nThese data indicate an association between the presence of AAA in patients selected for surgical treatment of AAA and elevated homocysteine plasma levels and suggest that homocysteine may induce endothelial perturbation and stimulation in these patients.",

    "abstract": "We describe a technique for end-to-end sleeve anastomosis that may enable minimally invasive bypass grafting and characterize the tensile strength, stenosis rate, durability, and healing of the anastomosis.\nAn anastomotic device assembly consisting of a cable tie-type band with mobile teeth elements is mounted on the outer surface of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The graft is drawn over the artery resulting in a sleeve of vessel within the graft. As the band is tightened over an intraluminal obturator, the independently mobile anchoring teeth are driven through the graft into the artery. The tensile strength of the anastomosis was compared with sutured anastomosis during in vitro studies using cadaveric human femoral arteries. For in vivo studies on pigs and goats, we used a proximal exovascular sleeve anastomosis along with a distal sutured aortic anastomosis. Survival animals were studied by angiogram postoperatively and at the time of explantation.\nIn vitro studies showed no difference in maximal tensile strength between sutured and exovascular anastomoses (10.5 +/- 2.7 lb vs 10.2 +/- 3.0 lb, P =.83). However, loss of continuous graft to artery interface occurred at lower loads in the sutured anastomoses (6.5 +/- 0.6 lb, P <.05). In total, all 24 pigs tested in nonsurvival or survival settings sustained a successful and leakproof anastomosis. Of the 13 nonsurvival cases, maximal epinephrine-induced hypertension sustained over 15 minutes (peak systolic blood pressure > 210-250 mm Hg) was tolerated without leakage in a subgroup of five animals (100%). All 11 survival pigs had no pseudoaneurysms or stenosis relative to sutured control anastomoses at 6 week explantation (8.2 +/- 1.25 mm vs 8.5 +/- 1.6 mm, P =.21). The three long-term survival goats had no pseudoaneurysm or stenosis after 40 weeks. Histologic examination confirmed healing of the aorta to graft with minimal neointimal hyperplasia.\nExovascular sutureless anastomosis appears comparable to sutured anastomosis in stenosis rate, healing, and durability, with some advantages in tensile strength and rapidity of application.",

In total, all 24 pigs tested in nonsurvival or survival settings sustained a successful and leakproof anastomosis. Of the 13 nonsurvival cases, maximal epinephrine-induced hypertension sustained over 15 minutes (peak systolic blood pressure > 210-250 mm Hg) was tolerated without leakage in a subgroup of five animals (100%). All 11 survival pigs had no pseudoaneurysms or stenosis relative to sutured control anastomoses at 6 week explantation (8.2 +/- 1.25 mm vs 8.5 +/- 1.6 mm, P =.21). The three long-term survival goats had no pseudoaneurysm or stenosis after 40 weeks. Histologic examination confirmed healing of the aorta to graft with minimal neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of eligibility among patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) considered for endovascular repair and to examine the effect of an endovascular program on the institutional pattern of AAA repair.\nAll patients evaluated for endovascular AAA repair since the inception of an endovascular program were reviewed for determination of eligibility rates and eventual treatment. Open AAA repairs were categorized as simple (uncomplicated infrarenal), complex (juxtarenal, suprarenal, thoracoabdominal, infected), or ruptured, and their rates before and after initiation of an endovascular program were compared.\nOver 3 years, 324 patients were considered for endovascular AAA repair; 176 (54%) were candidates, 138 (43%) were not candidates, and 10 (3%) did not complete the evaluation. The rate of eligibility increased significantly from 45% (66/148 patients) during the first half of this period to 63% (110/176 patients) during the second half (P <. 001). Candidates were significantly younger (74.4 +/- 7.6 years) than noncandidates (78.3 +/- 6.7 years) (P <.01), and their aneurysm diameter tended to be smaller (57.6 +/- 9.2 mm compared with 60.8 +/- 12.3 mm; P =.06). The most common reason for ineligibility was an inadequate proximal aortic neck. Of 176 candidates, 78% underwent endovascular repair, and 6% underwent open repair. Of 138 noncandidates, 56% underwent surgical repair. Over a period of 6 years, 542 patients with AAAs (429 simple, 86 complex, 27 ruptured) underwent open repair. The total number and ratio of simple to complex open repairs for nonruptured aneurysms during the 3 years before the initiation of the endovascular program (213 simple, 44 complex) were not significantly different from the repairs over the subsequent 3-year period (216 simple, 42 complex). Similarly, no difference in the total number and the ratio of simple to complex open repairs was found between the first and the second 18-month periods since the initiation of the endovascular program.\nThe rate of eligibility of patients with AAA for endovascular repair appears to be higher than previously reported. The presence of an active endovascular program has not decreased the number or shifted the distribution of open AAA repair.",

The effect of HRT on the outcome of women undergoing infrainguinal bypass grafting is unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the influence of risk factors, in particular HRT, on the outcome of women undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafting.\nDuring a 5-year period (between 1993 and 1998), 131 femoropopliteal bypass graft procedures were performed in 106 women. The criteria prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards (Society for Vascular Surgery/North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery) were followed. Both univariate (Kaplan-Meier method) and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazards model) were used to determine the association among preoperative variables, graft patency, limb salvage, and survival.\nThe average age of the patients was 66.4 years; 26% of the patients were receiving HRT. Indications for femoropopliteal bypass grafting were limb salvage (80%) and disabling claudication (20%). Autogenous vein was used in 48% of procedures, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 49%, and PTFE-vein composite grafts in 3%. Distal popliteal anastomosis was above the knee in 52% and below the knee in 48%. Overall primary patency rate was 81% at 1 year, 65% at 3 years, and 56% at 5 years. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 75%, 45%, and 23%, respectively, for HRT users and 84%, 72%, and 65%, respectively, for nonusers of HRT. Overall, cumulative 1- and 5-year limb salvage results were 96% and 92%, respectively, and long-term survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 96%, 86% and 74%, respectively. With univariate and Cox regression analyses, HRT was identified as the only independent predictor of reduced primary graft patency (Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, P =.004; relative risk, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.8). Women receiving HRT who underwent a procedure with PTFE had the lowest primary graft patency rates (relative risk, 3.4; 95% CI, 1. 5-7.8; P =.006).\nWomen undergoing femoropopliteal bypass graft procedures who are receiving HRT have significantly reduced primary graft patency rates.

    "abstract": "Although there are numerous reports comparing saphenous vein (SV) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with respect to the patency rates for femoropopliteal bypass grafts, the clinical consequences of failed grafts are not as well described. This study compares the outcomes of failed SV and PTFE grafts with a specific emphasis on the degree of acute limb ischemia caused by graft occlusion.\nOver a 6-year period, 718 infrainguinal revascularization procedures were performed, of which 189 were femoropopliteal bypass grafts (SV, 108; PTFE, 81). Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS) standardized runoff scores were calculated from preoperative arteriograms. Clinical categories of acute limb ischemia resulting from graft occlusion were graded according to SVS/ISCVS standards (I, viable; II, threatened; III, irreversible). Primary graft patency and limb salvage rates at 48 months were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.\nPatients were well matched for age, sex, and comorbidities. Chronic critical ischemia was the operative indication in most cases (SV, 82%; PTFE, 80%; P =.85). Runoff scores and preoperative ankle-brachial index measurements were similar for the two groups (SV, 6.0 +/- 2.5 [SD] and 0.51 +/- 0.29; PTFE, 5.3 +/- 2.8 and 0.45 +/- 0.20; P =.06 and P =.12). The distal anastomosis was made below the knee in 60% of SV grafts and 16% of PTFE grafts (P <.001). Grade II ischemia was more likely to occur after occlusion of PTFE grafts (78%) than after occlusion of SV grafts (21%; P =.001). Emergency revascularization after graft occlusion was required for 28% of PTFE failures but only 3% of SV graft failures (P <.001). Primary graft patency at 48 months was 58% for SV grafts and 32% for PTFE grafts (P =.008). Limb salvage was achieved in 81% of SV grafts but only 56% of PTFE grafts (P =.019).\nPatients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafting with PTFE are at greater risk of ischemic complications from graft occlusion and more frequently require emergency limb revascularization as a result of graft occlusion than patients receiving SV grafts. Graft patency and limb salvage are superior with SV in comparison with PTFE in patients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafting.",

Outcomes were comparable in the two groups with respect to mechanical stability of the filter.\nThe prophylactic indication for vena caval filter placement in patients with trauma is associated with a low incidence of adverse outcomes while providing protection from fatal pulmonary embolism.

    "abstract": "Our preliminary experience with physical examination alone in the evaluation of penetrating zone 2 neck injuries for vascular trauma was previously reported in 28 patients over a 2-year period (1991-1993). The purpose of the current study was to examine the results of this approach in a much larger group of patients over an 8-year period.\nThe medical records for all patients admitted to our level I trauma center (all of them entered into our prospective protocol) between December 1991 and April 1999 with penetrating zone 2 neck trauma were reviewed for their initial presentation and any documented vascular injury.\nA total of 145 patients made up the study group; in 30 of these patients, the penetrating trajectory also traversed zone 1 or 3. Thirty-one patients (21%) had hard signs of vascular injury (active bleeding, expanding hematoma, bruit/thrill, pulse deficit, central neurologic deficit) and were taken immediately to the operating room; 28 (90%) of these 30 patients had either major arterial or venous injuries requiring operative repair (the false-positive rate for physical examination thus being 10%). Of the 114 patients with no hard signs, 23 underwent arteriography because of proximity of the injury to the vertebral arteries or because the trajectory included another zone. Of these 23 arteriograms, three showed abnormalities, but only one required operative repair. This case had no complications relating to the initial delay. The remaining 91 patients with no hard signs were observed without imaging or surgery for a minimum of 23 hours, and none had any evidence of vascular injury during hospitalization or during the initial 2-week follow-up period (1/114; false-negative rate for physical examination, 0.9%).\nThis series confirms the earlier report indicating that patients with zone 2 penetrating neck wounds can be safely and accurately evaluated by physical examination alone to confirm or exclude vascular injury. The missed-injury rate is 0.7% (1/145) with this approach, which is comparable to arteriography in accuracy but less costly and noninvasive. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm this management option.",

Of the 114 patients with no hard signs, 23 underwent arteriography because of proximity of the injury to the vertebral arteries or because the trajectory included another zone. Of these 23 arteriograms, three showed abnormalities, but only one required operative repair. This case had no complications relating to the initial delay. The remaining 91 patients with no hard signs were observed without imaging or surgery for a minimum of 23 hours, and none had any evidence of vascular injury during hospitalization or during the initial 2-week follow-up period (1/114; false-negative rate for physical examination, 0.9%).",

    "abstract": "This retrospective review describes the surgical management of consecutive patients with severe hypertension and ischemic nephropathy due to atherosclerotic renovascular disease.\nFrom January 1987 through December 1998, a total of 590 patients underwent operative renal artery repair at our center. A subgroup of 232 hypertensive patients (97 women, 135 men; mean age, 66 +/- 8 years) with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and preoperative serum creatinine levels of 1.8 mg/dL or more forms the basis of this report. Change in renal function was determined from glomerular filtration rates estimated from preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine. The influence of selected preoperative parameters and renal function response on time to dialysis and dialysis-free survival was determined by a proportional hazards regression model.\nIn all, 83 patients underwent unilateral renal artery repair and 149 patients underwent bilateral repair, including repair to a solitary kidney in 17 cases. A total of 332 renal arteries were reconstructed, and 32 nephrectomies were performed in these patients. After surgery, there were 17 deaths (7.3%) in the hospital or within 30 days of surgery. Advanced patient age (P =.001; hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI [1.1, 1.2]) and congestive heart failure (P =.04; hazard ratio, 2.9 CI [1.0, 8.6]) demonstrated significant and independent associations with perioperative mortality. With a change of 20% or more in EGFR being considered significant, 58% of patients had improved renal function, including 27 patients removed from dialysis dependence; function was unchanged in 35% and worsened in 7%. Follow-up death from all causes or progression to dialysis dependence demonstrated a significant and independent association with early renal function response. Both patients whose function was unchanged (P =.005; hazard ratio, 6.0; CI [2.2, 16.6]) and patients whose function was worsened (P =.03; hazard ratio, 2.2; CI [1.1, 4. 5]) remained at increased risk of death or dialysis dependence. For patients with unchanged renal function after operation, risk of death or dialysis demonstrated a significant interaction with preoperative renal function. In addition to severe preoperative renal dysfunction, diabetes mellitus demonstrated a significant and independent association with follow-up death or dialysis.\nSurgical correction of atherosclerotic renovascular disease can retrieve excretory renal function in selected hypertensive patients with ischemic nephropathy. Patients with improved renal function had a significant and independent increase in dialysis-free survival in comparison with patients whose function was unchanged and patients whose function was worsened after operation. These results add further evidence in support of a prospective, randomized trial designed to define the value of renal artery intervention in patients with ischemic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of main renal artery Doppler scanning interrogation and hilar analysis to diagnose hemodynamically significant renal artery disease.\nFrom January 1998 to August 1999, 41 patients had renal duplex sonography with both main renal artery interrogation and hilar analysis followed by angiography. They form the basis of this review. The sample consisted of 24 men and 17 women, with a mean age of 68.9 +/- 10.2 years, who provided 80 kidneys for comparative analysis. Significant renal artery disease revealed through angiography was defined as >/= 60% diameter-reducing stenosis or occlusion. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) (in meters per second) and the presence of poststenotic turbulence (PST) were determined from main renal artery interrogation. Acceleration time (AT) (in milliseconds) was measured by means of hilar analysis. Significant renal artery stenosis was defined by a PSV of 2.0 m/s or more and a PST or an AT more than 100 ms. Sensitivity analyses of both PSV and AT were examined, and 95% CIs were computed. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to estimate optimal values for PSV and AT.\nAngiography revealed hemodynamically significant fibromuscular dysplasia in 5 kidneys (4 patients), atherosclerotic stenosis >/= 60% in 48 kidneys (30 patients), and renal artery occlusion in 4 kidneys (4 patients). Kidneys with significant renal artery stenosis had a higher PSV (2.54 +/- 0.11 vs 1.28 +/- 0.08, P <.001) and AT (82.43 +/- 7.2 vs 30.0 +/- 2.8, P <.001) compared with those without stenosis. Compared with angiography, a PSV of 2.0 m/s or more and PST demonstrated a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 96%, and overall accuracy of 92% for detection of significant renal artery stenosis. Two of five studies with false-negative results reflected diseased polar vessels. By contrast, AT of more than 100 ms had a sensitivity of 32%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 54%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a PSV of more than 1.8 m/s and an AT of 58 ms or greater as optimal values. With an AT of 58 ms or more, the sensitivity was 58%, and specificity was 96%, with an overall accuracy of 70%. There were no apparent associations between PSV or AT and type or location of renal artery lesion, serum creatinine level, or end-diastolic ratio.\nMain renal artery interrogation is an accurate screening test to detect significant stenosis or occlusion of the main renal artery. Hilar analysis alone does not provide sufficient sensitivity to be used as a sole screening study. Neither method detects the presence of renovascular disease associated with polar vessels.",

One additional patient died 72 months after failure of a subsequent aortic reconstruction, so that the overall treatment-related mortality was 19%, whereas overall survival by means of life table analysis was 56% at 5 years. No amputations were required in the postoperative period, but four patients (11%) required amputation during follow-up. Twelve patients (35%) had extra-anatomic bypass graft failure during follow-up, and six patients underwent secondary aortic reconstruction (thoracobifemoral [2], iliofemoral [2], femorofemoral [2]).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of patient compliance on a program of watchful waiting in cases of small abdominal aortic aneurysms and to document the proportion of patients who become prohibitive operative risks during follow-up.\nA retrospective review was conducted at a regional military veterans medical center. The subjects were 101 male military veterans with abdominal aortic aneurysms measuring less than 5 cm who did not have medical contraindications to operative repair. The main outcome measures were (1) the proportion of patients who missed three scheduled radiologic tests in a row despite written notifications mailed to their homes and (2) the proportion of compliant patients who had medical illnesses and became prohibitive operative risks during follow-up.\nDuring a follow-up (mean +/- SEM) of 34 +/- 2 months, 69 patients (69%) were fully compliant with the watchful waiting program and underwent a mean of 4.5 +/- 0.3 radiologic tests. There were no abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures in this subgroup. Twenty-five patients (36%) had indications for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 28 (41%) have not met the criteria for repair. Sixteen (23%) of the 69 compliant patients developed prohibitive medical risks during follow-up; eight (50%) of these 16 patients died, all of the causes unrelated to their abdominal aortic aneurysms. Thirty-two (32%) of the 101 study subjects were noncompliant with the watchful waiting program. Twenty-seven (84%) of the noncompliant patients did not keep any scheduled appointments, and five (16%) were lost after one or two examinations. Three of the noncompliant patients experienced documented abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, and it is suspected in a fourth. Direct contact was made with 28 (88%) of these patients or their families; all acknowledged having received written notifications regarding their watchful waiting program tests and had decided not to continue with surveillance for a variety of socioeconomic reasons. Between the 69 compliant patients and the 32 noncompliant patients, there were no differences with respect to mean age (70 +/- 1 years vs 73 +/- 2 years), distance from home of record to the hospital (62 +/- 14 miles vs 73 +/- 23 miles), or abdominal aortic aneurysm size at initial detection (3.75 +/- 0.5 cm vs 3.8 +/- 0.5 cm).\nWatchful waiting programs are imperfect and highly reliant on the motivation levels and means of the individual patients. Watchful waiting is reasonable among compliant patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, inasmuch as fewer than half will meet the criteria for intervention within a mean of 3 years. Approximately one fourth of these patients will have medical contraindications to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair during follow-up, and many of these will die of causes other than abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. In our experience, one third of candidates for watchful waiting programs are unable to participate and are at risk of rupture. These patients need special attention so that the reasons for their noncompliance can be determined, and they may be candidates for earlier intervention.",

There were no abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures in this subgroup. Twenty-five patients (36%) had indications for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 28 (41%) have not met the criteria for repair. Sixteen (23%) of the 69 compliant patients developed prohibitive medical risks during follow-up; eight (50%) of these 16 patients died, all of the causes unrelated to their abdominal aortic aneurysms. Thirty-two (32%) of the 101 study subjects were noncompliant with the watchful waiting program. Twenty-seven (84%) of the noncompliant patients did not keep any scheduled appointments, and five (16%) were lost after one or two examinations. Three of the noncompliant patients experienced documented abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, and it is suspected in a fourth. Direct contact was made with 28 (88%) of these patients or their families; all acknowledged having received written notifications regarding their watchful waiting program tests and had decided not to continue with surveillance for a variety of socioeconomic reasons. Between the 69 compliant patients and the 32 noncompliant patients, there were no differences with respect to mean age (70 +/- 1 years vs 73 +/- 2 years), distance from home of record to the hospital (62 +/- 14 miles vs 73 +/- 23 miles), or abdominal aortic aneurysm size at initial detection (3.75 +/- 0.5 cm vs 3.8 +/- 0.5 cm).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for categorizing the severity of carotid disease relative to duplex ultrasound scan and cerebral contrast arteriography (CA) to determine if MRA imaging could replace the need for cerebral angiography in cases of indeterminate or inadequate duplex scan imaging.\nSeventy-four carotid bifurcations in 40 patients undergoing 45 carotid endarterectomies from 1996 to 1998 were imaged with duplex ultrasound scan; MRA (two-dimensional neck and three-dimensional intracranial, time-of-flight technique); and biplanar, digital subtraction cerebral arteriography. Studies were blindly reviewed by one reader who used established threshold velocity criteria for the duplex scan and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method for MRA and CA to determine the percentage of diameter reduction of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Disease severity was grouped into four categories (< 50%, 50%-74%, 75%-99% stenosis and occlusion), and the results of MRA and duplex ultrasound scan were compared with CA.\nSensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detection of > 50% ICA stenosis were 100%, 96%, 98%, and 100% for MRA and 100%, 72%, 88%, and 100% for duplex ultrasound scan, respectively; similarly, for detection of > 75% ICA stenosis values were 100%, 77%, 76%, and 100% for MRA and 90%, 74%, 72%, and 91% for duplex ultrasound scan, respectively. Both MRA and duplex ultrasound scan accurately differentiated all cases of > 95% stenosis (n = 7) from occlusion (n = 4). Short length ICA flow gaps were present on MRA in all cases of 75% to 99% stenosis and one half of cases of CA-defined 50% to 74% stenosis. In patients with 50% to 74% stenosis, the mean angiographic stenosis was significantly greater when a flow gap was present on MRA (64% +/- 6%) versus no flow gap (57% +/- 7%) (P =.04). There was overall agreement among duplex ultrasound scan, MRA, and CA in 73% of carotids imaged. Of the 24% discordant results between MRA and duplex ultrasound scan, MRA correctly predicted disease severity in all cases, and inaccurate duplex ultrasound scan results were due to overestimation in 83% of cases. The operative plan was altered by CA findings in only one patient (2%) after duplex ultrasound scan and MRA.\nMRA can accurately categorize the severity of carotid occlusive disease. Duplex ultrasound scan facilitates patient selection for carotid endarterectomy in most cases, but adjunct use of MRA improves diagnostic accuracy for > 75% stenoses and may obviate the need for cerebral arteriography when duplex scan results are inconclusive or demonstrate borderline disease severity.",

    "abstract": "The management of unacceptable distal internal carotid artery (ICA) end points during carotid endarterectomy presents multiple dilemmas. The problem may be expeditiously solved by placement of an intraluminal stent, but reported clinical experience with this technique is limited. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with intraoperative stenting of the ICA for the correction of unacceptable distal ICA end points during carotid endarterectomy. We report our techniques and document the 30-day stroke morbidity-death rate and midterm outcomes of patients treated in this manner.\nThe records of 316 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed by the authors from January 1997 through June 1999 were reviewed to identify those cases in which adjunctive intraoperative stenting of the distal ICA was used. For those patients treated with adjunctive ICA stents, we assessed technique, 30-day outcomes, and midterm outcomes.\nThe 30-day combined stroke and death rate for the entire group of 316 carotid endarterectomies was 1.9%. Adjunctive distal ICA stents were used in 13 cases-4.1% of the total carotid endarterectomy group-for the correction of unacceptable distal ICA end points. All patients were male; the average age was 70 years. Stents were used in 11 patients because in each of these cases the surgeon recognized an unacceptable end point and desired to limit further distal anatomic exposures and/or ischemia times. Stents were used in two patients to correct unexpected defects identified on intraoperative completion ultrasound scan. No 30-day periprocedural deaths, strokes, or transient ischemic attacks were observed. Average postoperative length of stay was 1.8 days (range, 1-5 days). All patients have been followed up with serial carotid duplex scans, and one patient has been studied by means of angiography. No patients have died, and all remain in active clinical follow-up. Mean length of follow-up has been 15 months. No significant asymptomatic recurrences have been observed, but one patient experienced an isolated episode of amaurosis fugax without demonstrable restenosis at 8 months postoperatively.\nOur experience suggests that the adjunctive use of stents for the correction of unacceptable distal ICA end points during carotid endarterectomy is safe and provides acceptable short-term and midterm outcomes. Continued follow-up will be required before this technique can be considered a primary choice rather than an expeditious secondary alternative in this infrequent clinical circumstance.",

    "abstract": "Since the advent of subclavian artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting, several authorities advocate it as the treatment of choice for patients with subclavian artery disease, claiming results equal to or better than those of reconstructive vascular surgery. However, most of their quoted surgical series included patients who may have other brachiocephalic disease who were treated nonuniformly by means of various bypass grafts with different grafts in the same series (eg, Dacron, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE], or vein). In this study, we analyze the long-term results of a large series of carotid-subclavian bypass grafts for subclavian artery disease in which PTFE was uniformly used; the study can be used as a future reference to compare the results of subclavian artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting.\nFifty-one patients with symptomatic subclavian artery disease (40 occlusions and 11 stenoses) who were treated with carotid-subclavian bypass grafts (PTFE [Goretex]) during a 20-year period were analyzed. Graft patency was determined clinically and confirmed with Doppler scanning pressures and duplex ultrasound scanning. The cumulative patency, overall survival, and symptom-free survival rates were calculated with the life table method.\nIndications for surgery were arm ischemia in 34 patients (67%), vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) in 27 (53%), and symptomatic subclavian steal in 7 (14%). A combination of arm ischemia and VBI occurred in 17 (33%) of these patients. The mean follow-up was 7.7 years with a median of 7.0 years (range, 1-19 years). The 30-day morbidity rate was 6%, with no perioperative stroke or mortality. Immediate relief of symptoms was achieved in 100% of patients; however, four patients (8%) had late recurrent symptoms (three with VBI). The primary patency and secondary patency rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 100%, 98%, 96%, and 92% and 100%, 98%, 98%, and 95%, respectively. The symptom-free survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 100%, 96%, 82%, and 47%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 100%, 98%, 86%, and 57%. The mean hospital stay was 3.5 days in the late 70s and 80s and 2.1 days in the 90s (P <. 001).\nCarotid-subclavian bypass grafts with PTFE grafts for subclavian artery disease are safe, effective, and durable and should remain the procedure of choice, particularly in good-risk patients.",

After initial tracheostomy, angiography confirmed rupture of the mid cervical internal carotid artery as well as contribution to the resultant pseudoaneurysm from external carotid branches. Treatment began with coil embolization of the external carotid branches. The internal carotid lesion, a defect approximately 1 cm in length, was then closed through use of two stent grafts, each made from Palmaz stents and 3-mm polytetrafluorethylene grafts predilated to 6 mm. The neck hematoma was then evacuated surgically.\nCompletion angiography and computed tomographic scanning confirmed control of the hemorrhage. The patient survived neurologically intact with the exception of cranial nerve deficits caused by the hemorrhage. The tracheostomy tube was removed 3 weeks postoperatively. Follow-up computed tomographic scanning showed a gradual decrease in the size of the cervical soft tissue and no recurrent aneurysm.\nNeurofibromatosis is a rare cause of aneurysmal degeneration of blood vessels. Repair of a ruptured cervical internal carotid artery aneurysm, though feasible, is difficult with stent grafts; however, this is a better option than surgical intervention in inaccessible vessels.",

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumors (CBTs) have an unpredictable history with no correlation between histology and clinical behavior. Of reported cases since 1891, local and distant metastases appear in approximately 10% of cases and remain the hallmark of malignancy. Currently, there are not enough data to support a single treatment regimen for malignant CBTs. The reported case demonstrates some unanswered issues with regard to malignant CBTs to include lymph node dissection, the need for carotid resection, and the role of radiation therapy. A 46-year-old pathologist underwent a resection of a Shamblin I CBT, to include jugular lymph node sampling, without complication. There was lymph node involvement, and tumor cells were found on the margins of the pathologic specimen. Subsequent carotid resection with reversed interposition saphenous vein graft and modified neck dissection were performed again without complication. Follow-up at 4 years has been uneventful. Diagnosis of CBTs with the use of magnetic resonance angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, color flow duplex scanning, and the role of arteriography are reviewed. The current treatment options are discussed with reference to primary lymph node sampling, carotid resection, and neck dissection in malignant cases. This case demonstrates that the unpredictable nature of CBTs and their malignant potential warrant aggressive initial local treatment to include jugular lymph node sampling and complete tumor resection.",

    "abstract": "As survival among patients with renal failure improves, vascular access becomes more difficult, and preservation of functioning access increases in importance. Subclavian vein thrombosis associated with a distal arteriovenous fistula can result in massive and debilitating swelling of the affected extremity. We describe a novel crossover bypass grafting procedure to the contralateral internal jugular vein in a patient with a thrombosed internal jugular and subclavian vein. This procedure resulted in preservation of the functioning arteriovenous fistula and resolution of the symptoms. Unlike previously described crossover procedures to the contralateral basilic or axillary veins, this bypass graft has the added benefit of not obviating future fistula creation in that extremity.",

Magnetic resonance angiography clearly demonstrated stenosis of the proximal celiac artery. She underwent laparoscopic decompression by division of the ligament and excision of the celiac plexus. Laparoscopic Doppler ultrasound scanning demonstrated markedly improved flow in the artery. She was discharged in 15 hours and reported complete resolution of her symptoms at the 3-month postoperative visit. Laparoscopy provides a less invasive but equally effective method for decompressing the celiac artery as well as assessing adequacy of flow after its release.",

    "abstract": "Restenosis after angioplasty or bypass grafting to restore circulation to ischemic organs is still an unsolved problem. Thrombin generated in high concentrations at the sites of vascular injury plays a central role in thrombosis and hemostasis. alpha-Thrombin has also been implicated as a mitogen for smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation that contributes to arterial restenosis. Thrombomodulin has a high affinity of binding with thrombin and converts thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant. This study was designed to examine whether thrombomodulin could also moderate the thrombin-mediated SMC proliferative response.\nPorcine carotid artery SMCs (passages 4-7) were plated onto 96-well plates and incubated for 3 days. After growth arrest in a defined serum-free medium for 2 to 3 days, SMCs were subjected to the reagents as follows: (1) human alpha-thrombin, (2) recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin containing a chondroitin sulfate moiety, (3) thrombin receptor agonist peptide (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF), and (4) alpha-thrombin or thrombin receptor agonist peptide combined with recombinant thrombomodulin (rTM). The viability and proliferation status of SMCs were quantified with MTT (thiazolyl blue) mitochondrial function and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-DNA incorporation assays.\nHuman alpha-thrombin increased SMC proliferation in a dose dependent manner by more than 25% and 30% with thrombin 1 U/mL to 3 U/mL compared with control groups on day 7 (P <.006). rTM concentrations from 0.5 microg/mL to 3 microg/mL have no significant effect on SMC growth. The stimulation of SMC proliferation induced by alpha-thrombin at 0.5 U/mL, 1 U/mL, and 2 U/mL was significantly inhibited with rTM at 2 microg/mL and 3 microg/mL on days 3, 7, and 10 as evaluated with MTT assay (P <.01 to <.05) and BrdU-DNA incorporation assay on day 3 (P <.008). Thrombin receptor agonist peptide increased SMC BrdU-DNA incorporation at 48 hours (P <.007), and its effect was not altered by rTM.\nrTM containing all of the extracellular domains of thrombomodulin inhibits the effect of thrombin on SMC proliferation in vitro. Because thrombin is a mitogenic mediator of SMC in vascular injury, inhibition of its function in vivo could help to prevent SMC hyperplasia. The success of further studies in vivo may lead to use of rTM for decreasing or preventing arterial restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Pulsatile wall motion has been suggested as a means by which to evaluate abdominal aortic aneurysms after exclusion from the circulation to determine whether the treatment has been effective. The objective of this study was to investigate the relations between pulsatile wall motion and both the mean and pulse pressures within the aneurysmal sac for both patent and thrombosed endoleaks. Furthermore, we compared the measurements of pulsatile wall motion by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning and a wall track system to determine the most reliable technique.\nFirst, interobserver and intraobserver variability of M-mode ultrasound scan measurements was determined at different pressure levels in a cow iliac artery placed in an in vitro circulation. M-mode ultrasound scanning and a wall track system were compared in the same model. Second, in an animal experiment, an aneurysm and endoleak model with both patent and thrombosed endoleaks was created. Systemic and aneurysmal mean and pulse pressures were recorded synchronically with pulsatile wall motion by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning and a wall track system.\nThe intraobserver and interobserver variability values for M-mode ultrasound scan measurement in vitro were 0.11 mm (SD = 0.10 mm) and 0.15 mm (SD = 0.13 mm), respectively. In the animal study, a significant difference existed with respect to the level of pulse pressure within the aneurysmal sac between the group with pulsatile wall motion and the group without such motion (P <.0001). The presence of pulsatile wall motion was not correlated with the level of aneurysmal mean pressure. The level of pulsatile wall motion determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning correlated well with the level determined by means of the wall track system (r = 0. 74; P =.01). For the level of pulsatile wall motion determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning, a significant difference between patent and thrombosed endoleaks existed (P =.04). For detecting endoleaks, the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile wall motion as determined by means of the wall track system were 52% and 100%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile wall motion as determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning were 64% and 67%, respectively. For the detection of pulse pressure in the aneurysmal sac, the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile wall motion as determined by means of the wall track system were 76% and 100%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile wall motion as determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning were 90% and 71%, respectively.\nWe found that pulsatile wall motion is correlated with aneurysmal pulse pressure but not with the mean level of pressure inside the aneurysm. Although measurements of pulsatile wall motion are of great theoretic value when groups of patients who have undergone endovascular aneurysm repair are being compared, this method appears to be unreliable in a clinical setting with respect to determining whether the aneurysmal sac is still pressurized in individual patients.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are subjected to the physical forces induced by blood flow. The aim of this study was to directly compare the EC signaling pathway in response to cyclic strain and shear stress in cultured bovine aortic ECs.\nThe ECs were seeded on flexible collagen I-coated silicone membranes to examine the effect of cyclic strain. The membranes were deformed with a 150-mm Hg vacuum at a rate of 60 cycle/min for up to 120 minutes. For a comparison of the effect of shear stress, ECs from the same batch as used in the strain experiments were seeded on collagen I-coated silicone sheets. The ECs were then subjected to 10 dyne/cm(2) shear with the use of a parallel flow chamber for up to 120 minutes. Activation of the mitogen- activated protein kinases was assessed by determining phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 with immunoblotting.\nERK, JNK, and p38 were activated by both cyclic strain and shear stress. Both cyclic strain and shear stress activated JNK with a similar temporal pattern and magnitude and a peak at 30 minutes. However, shear stress induced a more robust and rapid activation of ERK and p38, compared with cyclic strain.\nOur results indicate that different mechanical forces induced differential activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. This suggests that there may be different mechanoreceptors in ECs to detect the different forces or alternative coupling pathways from a single receptor.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was (1) to find out whether preoperative inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) patency (on radiographic imaging) predicts IMA-related endoleaks after endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms, (2) to determine feasibility of measuring aneurysm sac pressures in patients with endoleaks, and (3) to report early evidence of effective endovascular obliteration of IMA endoleaks.\nWe studied 76 consecutive cases of infrarenal aortic aneurysms that were repaired with an endovascular approach (March 1998-April 1999).\nThere were 13 (17%) endoleaks persistent 30 days after the procedure. Eleven (85%) of these 13 were IMA-related endoleaks, which were documented with selective superior mesenteric artery angiography. The preoperative finding (on computed tomographic scan) of a patent IMA does not always predict an IMA-related endoleak, but results in a statistically and clinically significant higher ratio of patients with IMA-related endoleaks in the immediate postoperative period (24% versus 3%, P <.035). In eight of the 11 patients with persistent IMA-related endoleaks, measurement of intra-aneurysm sac pressures was possible, and six of these patients had systemic pressures within the excluded aneurysm sac. Nine (82%) of 11 IMA-related endoleaks were successfully obliterated by means of selective IMA embolization.\nMany endoleaks are caused by a patent IMA, and this can result in persistence of systemic pressure within the aneurysm sac. The preoperative finding (on computed tomographic scan) of a patent IMA is a predictor of increased rates of IMA endoleaks, and IMA endoleaks can be successfully obliterated through endovascular procedures, after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular grafting has markedly reduced the invasiveness of the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. By using a modification of technique for available closure devices, we have been able to achieve percutaneous repair of aneurysms. This study reviewed our initial experience with this technique.\nDemographics and background data from patients undergoing endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms were reviewed from prospectively collected registry data. Operative notes and angiographic and computed tomography scan data were retrospectively reviewed to assess the success of the percutaneous approach.\nFourteen patients have undergone percutaneous placement of the AneuRx (Medtronic, Sunnyvale, Calif) endovascular graft, with a modification of the technique for the Prostar (Perclose, Redwood City, Calif) device for access site closure. Main graft body introduction with a 22F sheath proved successful in nine of 12 (75%) deployments. Contralateral limb deployment through a 16F sheath was successful in 10 of 14 deployments (71.4%). Reasons for conversion to open groin incisions include inadequate percutaneous hemostasis (six cases), iliofemoral dissection (four cases), device failure (one case), and compromised distal flow (one case). Percutaneous deployment success appears to be improved with larger iliac artery dimensions, decreased calcification, and limited tortuosity, because of the limitation of complications related to delivering a larger diameter sheath. Of the 13 percutaneous endograft insertions that were attempted, six (46.2%) were completely successful.\nPercutaneous deployment of available devices is technically feasible by using modifications of technique with percutaneous closure devices, despite large introducer sizes. Further experience with this technique offers the potential for identifying patients in whom this will prove successful and for even further reducing hospital stay and recovery times for aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "The clinical success and patency of central and peripheral venous stents in patients with symptomatic venous obstruction (SVO) were assessed.\nThe records of patients with SVO treated with venous stents from 1992 to 1999 were reviewed. Demographic and procedural variables were analyzed to determine their effect on clinical success, primary patency, and secondary patency. Patency was determined by means of a follow-up duplex scan or venogram.\nForty central venous (CV) and 14 peripheral venous (PV) obstructions were treated in 49 patients. Sixty-five stents were placed (50 CV and 15 PV), 54 in previously unstented lesions and 11 in previously stented lesions. Causes of CV lesions included catheter placement (82%), tumor compression (6%), arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and no prior catheter (2%), and other (10%). All PV lesions resulted from complications of dialysis. Indications for CV stents included limb edema (46%), AVF malfunction (30%), both limb edema and AVF malfunction (14%), and other (10%). PV stent indications were AVF malfunction (86%) and limb edema (14%). Thirteen CV stents indicated to treat tumor compression (three cases), May-Thurner syndrome (one case), deep venous thrombosis (three cases), superior vena cava syndrome (one case), and lower-extremity catheter-related lesions (five cases) were excluded from the analysis of clinical outcome. Fifty-two stents (37 CV and 15 PV) were included in the analysis of clinical outcome. All CV lesions included in the analysis were complications of prolonged catheterization. Eighty-nine percent of patients had end-stage renal disease and an AVF. Complications developed in 26% of patients with PV stents and in no patients with CV stents (P <.002). The mean follow-up period was 16 months. Sixty-two percent of patients required a reintervention for recurrent SVO. Only 32% of the interventions resulted in sustained symptomatic improvement. For CV stents, the primary patency rate was 85%, 27%, and 9% at 3, 12, and 24 months, respectively; the secondary patency rate was 91%, 71%, and 39% at 3, 12, and 24 months, respectively; and the clinical success rate was 94%, 94%, and 79%, at 3, 12, and 24 months, respectively. For PV stents, the primary patency rate was 73%, 17% and 17% at 3, 12, and 24 months, respectively; the secondary patency rate was 80%, 56%, and 35% at 3, 12, and 24 months, respectively; and the clinical success rate was 92%, 75%, and 42% at 3, 12 and 24 months, respectively.\nStents provide a temporary benefit in most patients with central or peripheral upper-extremity SVO. Regular follow-up and reinterventions are required to maintain patency and achieve long-term clinical success. Stents used for CV lesions have higher clinical success rates than stents used for PV lesions. Patients with a reasonable life expectancy or who are unable to return for subsequent procedures should be considered for undergoing alternative therapy.",

    "abstract": "The current risk of stroke after carotid endarterectomy may be worse than reported in the international trials. Because studies have suggested that most operative strokes follow surgeon error, the aim of the current study was to audit the impact of introducing a strategy of perioperative monitoring and quality control assessment on outcome.\nA total of 500 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy with intraoperative transcranial Doppler scan monitoring, completion angioscopy, and 3 hours of postoperative transcranial Doppler scan monitoring. The last of these guided selective dextran therapy in patients with high rates of postoperative embolization, which in previous series has been shown to be highly predictive of progression to thromboembolic stroke.\nIntimal flaps were repaired in 3% of patients and luminal thrombus removed in 4% of patients. The rate of intraoperative stroke was 0.2%. A total of 313 patients had more than one embolus detected postoperatively (96% within 2 hours of flow restoration), but only 22 patients had sustained embolization requiring dextran. Embolization ceased in all but one patient receiving dextran, although the dose had to be increased in seven patients (36%). One patient was unable to receive adequate dextran therapy because of severe cardiac failure. Overall, the 30-day death/stroke rate was 2.2%, no patient had a perioperative stroke because of carotid thrombosis, and the rate of ipsilateral embolic stroke was 0.8%. Most complications resulted from cardiac pathology or intracranial hemorrhage.\nA program of monitoring and quality control assessment has been associated with a 60% decrease in the operative risk in comparison with that observed before implementation of the protocol.",

    "abstract": "The EUROSTAR (European Collaborators on Stent/graft techniques for aortic aneurysm repair) Registry was established in 1996 to collect data on the outcome of treatment of patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms with endovascular repair. To date, 88 European centers of vascular surgery have contributed. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the results of this treatment in the medium term (up to 4 years) according to the analysis of \"hard\" or primary end points of rupture, late conversion, and death.\nPatients with aortic aneurysms suitable for endovascular aneurysm repair were notified to the EUROSTAR Data Registry Centre before treatment to eliminate bias due to selective reporting. The following information was collected on all patients: (1) demographic details and the anatomic characteristics of their aneurysms, (2) details of the endovascular device used, (3) complications encountered during the procedure and the immediate outcome, (4) results of contrast enhanced computed tomographic imaging at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after operation and at yearly intervals thereafter, and (5) all adverse events. Life table analysis was performed to determine the cumulative rates of (1) death from all causes, (2) rupture, and (3) late conversion to open repair. Risk factors for rupture and late conversion were identified through regression analysis.\nBy March 2000, 2464 patients had been registered, and their mean duration of follow-up was 12.19 months (SD, 12.3 months). There were 14 patients with confirmed rupture of their aneurysms. The cumulative rate (risk) of rupture was approximately 1% per year. Emergency surgery was undertaken in 12 (86%) patients, of whom five (41.6%) survived. Two patients who were not treated surgically also died, which resulted in an overall death rate of 64.5% (9/14) of the patients. Significant risk factors for rupture were proximal type I endoleak (P =.001), midgraft (type III) endoleak (P =.001), graft migration (P =.001), and postoperative kinking of the endograft (P =.001). Forty-one patients underwent late conversion to open repair with a perioperative mortality rate of 24.4% (10/41). The cumulative rate (risk) of late conversion was approximately 2.1% per year. Risk factors (indications) for late conversion were proximal type I endoleak (P =. 001), midgraft (type III) endoleak (P =.001), type II endoleak (P =. 003), graft migration (P =.001), graft kinking (P =.001), and distal type I endoleak (P =.001).\nEndovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms with the first- and second-generation devices that predominated in this study was associated with a risk of late failure, according to an analysis of observed hard end points of 3% per year. Action taken to address the risk factors identified by the study may improve results in the future.",

    "abstract": "Cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts are used for femoral-infrapopliteal bypass graft purposes when adequate autogenous vein is unavailable. Anticoagulation, immunosuppression therapy, or both have been suggested means for improving allograft patency. Immunosuppression has significant cost and morbidity and has produced variable results. Our successful treatment of luminal surface hypercoagulability associated with certain endovascular procedures prompted the use of an anticoagulation protocol prospectively to improve graft patency and limb salvage for patients receiving femoral-infrapopliteal cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts.\nBetween September 1995 and October 1999, 24 patients (15 men and nine women) were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial for salvage of 26 severely ischemic lower limbs with femoral-infrapopliteal cryopreserved saphenous vein allograft bypass grafts. All patients were treated with a protocol (aspirin, low-dose heparin, low molecular weight dextran 40, dipyridamole, and warfarin), and no immunosuppressive agents were used. The cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts were matched to patients by ABO and Rh compatibility. Indications for revascularization were ischemic rest pain (n = 8), nonhealing ulcer (n = 13), or focal gangrene (n = 5), and no usable autogenous vein was available. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 35 months (mean, 19 months). We studied the location and type of outflow anastomosis, specific outflow vessel, morbidity, death, secondary procedures (digital/transmetatarsal amputation), and complications related to the treatment protocol. Life table analyses of primary graft patency and limb salvage were compared with other current reported data.\nPrimary graft patency with Kaplan-Meier life table analysis was 96% at 6 months, 87% at 12 months, and 82% at 18 and 24 months. There were no reoperations for acute graft occlusion. One graft underwent late segmental aneurysmal degeneration and rupture. There were no procedure-related deaths or bleeding complications. During late follow-up, anticoagulation was discontinued in three patients (12%) because of gastrointestinal bleeding. Limb salvage was 88% at 6 months and 80% at 12, 18, and 24 months. Patients returned to ambulatory status that was limited only by their other comorbidities.\nFemoral-infrapopliteal bypass graft for limb salvage with a cryopreserved saphenous vein allograft can be an acceptable alternative when autogenous vein is not available. Our treatment protocol substantially improved allograft patency and limb salvage when compared with current published data.",

    "abstract": "Erosion of pancreatic pseudocysts into adjacent vessels is a rare but highly lethal cause of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Percutaneous angiographic embolization (PAE) of the bleeding artery has recently been advocated as the preferred therapy. This study was undertaken to survey the outcome after treatment of this complication and to make recommendations for its management.\nAn 11-year retrospective analysis was performed of all patients treated at a large tertiary care referral center for visceral artery pseudoaneurysms associated with pancreatic pseudocysts.\nFrom 1988 to 1998, 256 patients were admitted for complications of pancreatic pseudocysts. Sixteen patients (11 men and 5 women) were identified in whom a pseudocyst had eroded into a major blood vessel with hemorrhage or development of a false aneurysm. The mean age was 45 years (range, 23-67 years). Active bleeding was present in 13 patients, whereas three had evidence of recent hemorrhage. Ten of 16 patients initially underwent operative therapy, four elective and six emergency, whereas six stable patients were initially treated with PAE. Technical failures of the initial treatment or secondary complications required both therapeutic modalities in six patients, which resulted in 13 total surgical interventions and 10 PAEs. The surgical morbidity rate was 62% (8 of 13), whereas that of PAE was 50% (5 of 10). Three deaths occurred after emergency operations, two of which failed to stop the bleeding, accounting for all of the deaths in the series (3 [19%] of 16). A trend was noted toward increased death with necrotizing pancreatitis (P =.07) and emergency surgery (P =.06). Ranson's criteria were not found to be predictive of death in this series. Surgical drainage procedures were required in seven (44%) of 16 patients for infections (n = 3) or mass effect of the pseudoaneurysm (n = 3). The mean size of pseudoaneurysms that required operative intervention for secondary complications was 13.9 cm, compared with 7.7 cm for all others in the series (P =.046). Long-term follow-up was available in all 13 survivors at a mean of 44 months (range, 1-108 months).\nThe management of pancreatic pseudocyst-associated pseudoaneurysms remains a challenging problem with high morbidity and death rates. Operation and PAE play complementary management roles. PAE is recommended as the initial therapy for hemodynamically stable patients. Surgery should be reserved for actively bleeding, hemodynamically unstable patients; for failed embolization; and for other secondary complications such as infection or extrinsic compression.",

    "abstract": "Aortic fenestration is rarely required for patients with acute or chronic aortic dissection. To better define its role and the indications for its use and to evaluate its success at relieving organ or limb malperfusion, we reviewed our experience with direct fenestration of the aorta.\nA retrospective analysis of all consecutive aortic fenestrations performed between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1999, was performed. Fourteen patients, 12 men and two women (mean age, 59.6 years; range, 43-81), underwent fenestration of the aorta. All patients were hypertensive and had a history of tobacco use. By Stanford classification, there were three type A and 11 type B patients. In the acute dissection group (n = 7), indications for surgery were malperfusion in six patients (leg ischemia, 4; renal ischemia, 5; bowel ischemia, 3) and intra-abdominal bleeding from rupture in two. In the chronic dissection group (n = 7), indications for surgery were abdominal aortic aneurysm in 4 patients (infrarenal, 3; pararenal, 1), thoracoabdominal aneurysm in 1, hypertension from coarctation of the thoracic aorta in 1, and aortic occlusion with disabling claudication in 1.\nEmergency aortic fenestration was performed in seven patients (surgically for 6 and percutaneously for 1). Fenestration level was infrarenal in four and pararenal in three. Concomitant abdominal aortic graft replacement was performed in four patients, combined with ascending aortic replacement (n = 1) and bilateral aortorenal bypasses (n = 1). In two patients, acute fenestration was performed for organ malperfusion after prior proximal aortic replacement (ascending aorta, 1; descending thoracic aorta, 1). Seven elective aortic fenestrations were performed for chronic dissection (descending thoracic aorta, 2; paravisceral aorta, 2; infrarenal aorta, 2 and pararenal aorta, 1). Concomitant aortic replacement was performed in six patients (abdominal aorta, 5; thoracoabdominal aorta, 1). Fenestration was successful at restoring flow in all 10 patients with malperfusion. Operative mortality for emergency fenestration was 43% (3/7). The three deaths that occurred were of patients with anuria or bowel ischemia, or both. There were no postoperative deaths for elective fenestration. At a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, there were no recurrences of malperfusion and no false aneurysm formations at the fenestration site.\nFenestration of the aorta can effectively relieve organ or limb ischemia. Bowel ischemia and anuria are indicators of dismal prognosis and emergency fenestration in these patients carries a high mortality. Elective fenestration combined with aortic replacement can be performed safely in chronic dissection. Aortic fenestration is indicated for carefully selected patients with malperfusion and offers durable benefits.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm (EAIA) repair uses substantial fluoroscopic guidance that requires considerable radiation exposure. Doses were determined for a team of three vascular surgeons performing 47 consecutive EAIA repairs over a 1-year period to determine whether this exposure constitutes a radiation hazard.\nTwenty-nine surgeon-made aortounifemoral devices and 18 bifurcated devices were used. Three surgeons wore dosimeters (1) on the waist, under a lead apron; (2) on the waist, outside a lead apron; (3) on the collar; and (4) on the left ring finger. Dosimeters were also placed around the operating table and room to evaluate the patient, other personnel, and ambient doses. Exposures were compared with standards of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).\nTotal fluoroscopy time was 30.9 hours (1852 minutes; mean, 39.4 minutes per case). Yearly total effective body doses for all surgeons (under lead) were below the 20 mSv/y occupational exposure limit of the ICRP. Outside lead doses for two surgeons approximated recommended limits. Lead aprons attenuated 85% to 91% of the dose. Ring doses and calculated eye doses were within the ICRP exposure limits. Patient skin doses averaged 360 mSv per case (range, 120-860 mSv). The ambient (> 3 m from the source) operating room dose was 1.06 mSv/y.\nAlthough the total effective body doses under lead fell within established ICRP occupational exposure limits, they are not negligible. Because radiation exposure is cumulative and endovascular procedures are becoming more common, individuals performing these procedures must carefully monitor their exposure. Our results indicate that a team of surgeons can perform 386 hours of fluoroscopy per year or 587 EAIA repairs per year and remain within occupational exposure limits. Individuals who perform these procedures should actively monitor their effective doses and educate personnel in methods for reducing exposure.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated our early experience with the transrenal fixation of aortic stent-grafts to determine the efficacy of this procedure and its effects on renal artery patency and hemodynamics.\nTwenty-eight patients (22 men) had endoluminally placed modular bifurcated stent-grafts with a bare spring structure at the proximal end crossing the origin of both renal arteries; no patient with infrarenal fixation was included for analysis. The mean age of the patients was 75 +/- 7 years (range, 58-86 years); the mean aneurysm size was 5.8 +/- 0.8 cm (range, 4.7-7.2 cm). Eight patients had preoperative or intraoperative angiographic evidence of renal artery atherosclerotic disease, but only four vessels had luminal narrowing of 50% or greater. No complications were noted during stent-graft placement, and all patients have returned for follow-up visits, ranging from 1 to 12 months (mean follow-up, 6 +/- 4 months). Follow-up evaluations included clinical assessment, duplex ultrasound scan of the renal arteries and kidneys, and computed tomographic angiography.\nNo evidence of lobular or sublobular perfusion defects of the renal parenchyma was detected postoperatively. Two patients exhibited postoperative changes in renal artery hemodynamics-one progressing from a 30% diameter reduction to a greater than 60% diameter stenosis at the 12-month follow-up visit and one with a normal renal artery preoperatively having elevated flow velocities indicative of a greater than 60% stenosis at the 1-month visit. Of 19 patients with normal preoperative renal function, only one has had persistently elevated serum creatinine levels.\nWe conclude from this experience that the transrenal placement of open stents is safe and effectively excludes the aneurysm, potentially expanding the availability of this technique to more patients with a short infrarenal aortic neck. Long-term follow-up is essential to determine the overall efficacy of this technique and to identify potential effects on renal artery hemodynamics or kidney function.",

    "abstract": "Shrinkage of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the hallmark of successful endoluminal treatment. Our goal was to prospectively assess the midterm to long-term shrinkage of the AAA sac after endovascular repair.\nA total of 123 patients with AAA underwent endoluminal treatment with the Ancure device at our institution between February 1996 and February 2000. At least a 1-year follow-up was available for 70 of the 123 patients. AAA sac size, presence of endoleaks, calcifications, and outcome data were collected on these patients at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after repair and compared with the preoperative AAA size and characteristics. All endoleaks found at the 6-month follow-up visit were treated aggressively with embolotherapy. An AAA sac regression of 0.5 cm or more was considered the minimum measurable decrease. Regression of the sac diameter to 3.5 cm or less was considered a complete collapse of the sac.\nSuccessful endoluminal repair was accomplished in 119 of 123 patients. The mortality rate was 0.8% (1/123). There was a steady decrease in AAA sac size from baseline (5.56 +/- 0.1 cm), to 6 months (5.0 +/- 0.14 cm, P =.0006), to 12 months (4.65 +/- 0.13 cm, P =.04), and to 24 months (4.26 +/- 0.16 cm, P =.03). At 24 months, 74% (29/39) had a decrease in sac size of 0.5 cm or more, with 28% (11/39) complete collapse. Patients with initial endoleaks had the same likelihood of regression of sac size (> or = 0.5 cm) when compared with the group of patients with no endoleaks at the 24-month evaluation (64% vs 76%, P =.09).\nEndoluminal AAA repair resulted in a significant reduction in sac size that continues up to 2 years. Significant shrinkage occurs as early as 6 months after placement. The initial presence of endoleaks does not predict the lack of sac regression.",

    "abstract": "During endovascular grafting of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), iliac limb extension to the external iliac artery may be indicated when the common iliac artery is ectatic or aneurysmal. Preliminary or concomitant coil embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA) is thus necessary to prevent potential reflux and endoleak. We sought to determine the safety of hypogastric flow interruption in this setting.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 156 patients who underwent stent-graft AAA repair at two institutions between February 1, 1998, and January 31, 1999. Coil embolization of one or both IIAs was undertaken when the diameter of the common iliac artery was more than 20 mm to enable limb endograft extension to the external iliac artery. Bilateral procedures were staged.\nThirty-nine (25%) of 156 patients were selected for coil embolization of one (n = 28) or both (n = 11) IIAs. The interventions were performed before (n = 31) or during (n = 8) the stent-graft procedure. Complications included groin hematomas in 3 patients, iliac artery dissection in 1, failure to catheterize the IIA in 2, and transient rise in the serum creatinine level in 3. One patient had erectile dysfunction, and five patients (13%) had buttock claudication after unilateral occlusion. Serious ischemic complications were not observed.\nCoil embolization of one or both IIAs appears to be safe in the setting of endovascular grafting of AAA. Buttock claudication is a relatively significant problem and may limit applicability of this strategy to patients who are unfit for standard open repair.",

    "abstract": "Embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA) may be performed during endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair if aneurysmal disease of the common iliac artery precludes graft placement proximal to the IIA orifice. The IIA may also be unintentionally occluded because of iliac trauma or coverage by the endograft. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, and consequences of IIA occlusion during endoluminal AAA repair.\nOver 2 years, 96 patients have undergone endoluminal AAA repair. The details of the operative procedure, reasons for IIA occlusion, perioperative complications, and clinical follow-up were recorded.\nThe IIA was intentionally occluded in 15 patients (16%) to treat 13 common iliac artery aneurysms, one IIA aneurysm, and one external iliac artery aneurysm. The IIA was unintentionally occluded in 9 patients (9%), resulting from traumatic iliac dissection in 5 patients and coverage of the IIA by the endograft in the remaining 4 patients. Three patients had colon ischemia. One patient with a unilateral IIA occlusion had sigmoid infarction necessitating resection. The other two patients underwent intentional occlusion of one IIA followed by unintentional occlusion of the contralateral IIA because of a traumatic iliac dissection. Both had postoperative abdominal pain and distention; rectosigmoid ischemia was revealed through colonoscopy. Conservative treatment with bowel rest and broad-spectrum antibiotics was successful in both cases. Nondisabling hip and buttock claudication occurred in seven patients (32%) at 1 month but resolved by 6 months in three of these patients.\nEmbolization of the IIA for iliac aneurysmal disease and unintentional IIA occlusion due to trauma or graft coverage occurs in a considerable number of patients undergoing endoluminal AAA repair. Most patients with unilateral occlusion do not experience colon ischemia or disabling claudication. Therefore, unilateral embolization of the IIA is well tolerated and allows for the endoluminal treatment of patients with both an AAA and an iliac artery aneurysm, thereby expanding the number of patients who can be managed with an endovascular approach. Although acute, bilateral IIA occlusions should be avoided, significant consequences were not observed in our small series of patients.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study was designed to determine the prevalence of deep reflux and the conditions under which it may occur in patients with primary superficial venous reflux and absence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).\nWe studied 152 limbs in 120 consecutive patients in the standing position who had superficial venous reflux with color flow duplex scanning. Limbs with documented evidence of DVT or post-thrombotic vein wall changes during the examination were studied but not included in the analysis. Limbs were divided into those that had at least reflux in the saphenofemoral, the saphenopopliteal, or the gastropopliteal junction and into those with nonjunctional reflux in the superficial and gastrocnemial veins. Peak velocity and duration of reflux were measured. To examine the recirculation theory, we tested the deep veins by occluding and refluxing saphenous veins 10 cm below the sampling site.\nThirteen limbs in 11 patients (9%) were excluded because of previous DVT. Of the remaining 139 limbs, 106 (76%) had junctional reflux. Saphenofemoral junction was involved in 89 limbs (84%), saphenopopliteal junction in 18 (17%), and gastropopliteal junction in 7 (4%). In 33 limbs (24%), reflux was detected in the main trunk or tributaries of the saphenous veins alone with no junctional incompetence. Femoral or popliteal reflux was present in 31 limbs (22%). This reflux was segmental in 27 limbs, and it was limited in the junction in 24 limbs. The mean duration of deep venous reflux was 0.9 seconds, it ranged from 0.6 to 3.7 seconds, and it was significantly shorter than that in the superficial veins (2.6 seconds; P <.0001). In the absence of junctional reflux, the prevalence of deep venous insufficiency (DVI) was significantly lower compared with that in limbs with junctional involvement (2 of 33 vs 29 of 106; P =.038). The mean duration of deep venous reflux in these groups was comparable (0.85 seconds vs 0. 91 seconds; P =.44). Occlusion of the incompetent superficial veins reduced somewhat the duration of the deep venous reflux but did not abolish it (0.88 seconds vs 0.82 seconds; P =.072). The presence of DVI was associated with junctional reflux of high peak velocity and long duration.\nThe prevalence of DVI in patients with primary superficial venous reflux and without history of DVT is 22%. However, this reflux is segmental, mainly in the common femoral vein, and is of short duration. It is associated with the presence of junctional incompetence that has a high peak velocity and long duration. These findings may explain why surgical correction of superficial reflux abolishes DVI.",

In the absence of junctional reflux, the prevalence of deep venous insufficiency (DVI) was significantly lower compared with that in limbs with junctional involvement (2 of 33 vs 29 of 106; P =.038). The mean duration of deep venous reflux in these groups was comparable (0.85 seconds vs 0. 91 seconds; P =.44). Occlusion of the incompetent superficial veins reduced somewhat the duration of the deep venous reflux but did not abolish it (0.88 seconds vs 0.82 seconds; P =.072). The presence of DVI was associated with junctional reflux of high peak velocity and long duration.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of carotid shunting in the context of eversion endarterectomy. A comparison of patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy by eversion with and without shunts was performed.\nOver a 5-year period, 2724 eversion carotid endarterectomies were performed. In most of these operations patients were under cervical block anesthesia. A shunt was used in 112 eversion endarterectomies (4.1%). Cervical block anesthesia was used in 103 patients (92.0%), general anesthesia was used in 5 patients (4.5%), and 4 patients (3.6%) were converted from cervical block to general anesthesia intraoperatively. The indications for shunting were neurologic deterioration in 99 patients (88.4%) who were under cervical block anesthesia, procedures performed in neurologically unstable or otherwise compromised patients who were under general anesthesia, and the operator's discretion in the remaining eight patients.\nThere was a combined stroke/death rate of 2.7% in the shunt group. These three cases included one death from myocardial infarction and one delayed death due to intracerebral hemorrhage after discharge. Shunt insertion was unrelated to the negative outcome in these two cases. One perioperative major stroke in the shunt group was identified. Follow-up averaged 12.3 months (range, 1-53 months).\nCarotid shunts can be used effectively in the context of eversion endarterectomy. Shunt insertion is not associated with an increased stroke/death rate in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of cranial and/or cervical nerve injuries after primary carotid endarterectomy (CEA) ranges from 3% to 48%; however, the clinical outcome of these injuries after repeat CEA has not been thoroughly analyzed in the English-language medical literature. This prospective study analyzes the incidence and outcome of cranial nerve injuries after repeat CEA.\nThis study includes 89 consecutive patients who had repeat CEAs. Preoperative and postoperative cranial nerve evaluations were performed, including clinical examinations (neurologic) and direct laryngoscopy. Patients with vagal or glossopharyngeal nerve injuries also underwent comprehensive speech evaluations, video stroboscopy, fluoroscopy, and methylene blue testing for aspiration. Patients with postoperative cranial nerve injuries were followed up for a long time to assess their recovery.\nTwenty-five cranial and/or cervical nerve injuries were identified in 19 patients (21%). They included 8 hypoglossal nerves (9%), 11 vagal nerves or branches (12%) (6 recurrent laryngeal nerves [7%], 3 superior laryngeal nerves [3%], and 2 complex vagal nerves [2%]), 3 marginal mandibular nerves (3%), 2 greater auricular nerves (2%), and 1 glossopharyngeal nerve (1%). Twenty-two (88%) of these injuries were transient with a complete healing time ranging from 2 weeks to 28 months (18 of 22 injuries healed within 12 months). The remaining three injuries (12%) were permanent (1 recurrent laryngeal nerve, 1 glossopharyngeal nerve, and 1 complex vagal nerve injury). The recurrent laryngeal nerve injury had a longer healing time than the other cranial nerve injuries.\nRepeat CEA is associated with a high incidence of cranial and/or cervical nerve injuries, most of which are transient. However, some of these have a long healing time, and a few can be permanent with significant disability.",

Changing practice patterns for CEA must be assessed to allow accurate comparisons. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of practice modifications related to CEA on patient outcome and cost data.\nData on patients undergoing CEAs at a single institution from fiscal year 1992 to 1998 were prospectively collected and entered into a computerized database. Records were reviewed for patient demographics and outcome with regard to stroke and death. Selected years that corresponded to transitions in perioperative management were audited for complete hospital financial information from.\nWe performed 960 CEAs during the study period, with a combined stroke and death rate of 1.1%.

In 1998, costs for patients who required arteriography were $1825 greater than those operated on during duplex scan examination alone in 1998. Statistically significant differences occurred in the year-to-year comparisons in the use of arteriography, intensive care unit monitoring, same day admissions, and length of stay. There were no statistically significant differences in the stroke and death rate between years.\nPractice changes related to CEA have resulted in significant savings without detriment in patient outcome. Comparisons between CEA and endovascular techniques will need to be evaluated within this context.

    "abstract": "Postoperative care after infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has traditionally involved admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). With the advent of endovascular AAA repair, the management of open procedures has received increased scrutiny. We recently modified our AAA clinical pathway to include selective use of the ICU.\nConsecutive elective infrarenal AAA repairs performed by members of the vascular surgery division at a university medical center from 1994 to 1999 were analyzed retrospectively with a computerized database, the Medical Archival Retrieval System. Group I consisted of 245 patients who were treated in the ICU for 1 or more days, and Group II included 69 patients admitted directly to the floor. Ruptured, symptomatic, suprarenal, endovascular, and reoperative repairs were excluded. Outcome variables were compared over the 6-year period.\nFloor admissions increased over the study period with 0%, 0%, 3.3%, 16.3%, 48.6%, and 43.6% of patients admitted directly to the surgery ward from 1994 to 1999. The average ICU length of stay declined from 4.6 to 1.2 days, whereas the hospital length of stay decreased from 12.5 to 6.8 days from 1994 to 1999. The change in ICU use had no effect on death (2.4% in Group I vs 0% in Group II). Major and minor morbidity was comparable. Hospital charges were significantly lower for patients in Group II.\nA policy of selective utilization of the ICU after elective infrarenal AAA repair is safe. It can reduce resource use without a negative impact on the quality of care.",

The variable interval of time after the sentinel bleed is the period in which most AEFs resulting from thoracic aortic aneurysm have been successfully treated. Although only a few successful cases have been reported in the literature, most describe an in situ repair. We describe treatment of a late-presenting AEF due to a thoracic aneurysm with an extra-anatomic bypass graft for the aortic repair.",

    "abstract": "The balance between cell death and proliferation in the vessel wall influences neointimal formation, remodeling, and eventual luminal narrowing after arterial injury. In this study, the time course of apoptosis, proliferation, and expression of p27-a critical regulator of cell-cycle progression-is characterized in a mouse model of transluminal arterial injury associated with substantial neointimal formation.\nC57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral femoral artery injury by passage of an angioplasty guidewire. Expression of p27, Ki67 proliferative index, and apoptosis, as well as histomorphometry, were analyzed in cross sections of uninjured arteries and arteries harvested at different time intervals after injury.\nIn the uninjured arteries, no apoptotic cells were detected, and p27 and Ki67 were expressed in less than 5% of medial cells. After injury, apoptosis increased markedly in medial smooth muscle cells from 1 to 24 hours and decreased gradually thereafter. Ki67 proliferative index increased after 1 week, peaked at 2 weeks in both the media and neointima, and decreased thereafter. p27 expression was undetectable from 1 to 48 hours, and increased gradually from 1 to 4 weeks. Well-developed neointima was present at 2 and 4 weeks.\nIn vivo injury to the mouse femoral artery evokes a rapid apoptotic response and downregulation of p27, followed by gradual increase in proliferation. During later phases of arterial repair, p27 expression increases while a shift of proliferation rates toward baseline occurs. Future experiments using this model in genetically modified mice may help identify specific cell-cycle regulatory molecules as therapeutic targets for control of pathologic arterial healing.",

    "abstract": "Along with the renin-angiotensin system, sympathetic stimulation may contribute to renovascular hypertension. The vasoactive peptide neuropeptide Y (NPY) is co-released with and potentiates the pressor effects of norepinephrine through the Y-1 receptor. NPY, by exaggerating sympathetic activity, may contribute to renovascular hypertension, possibly by augmenting adrenergic-mediated renin release. This was studied by determining the effect of continuous Y-1 blockade on the development of two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertension and the effect of NPY on in vitro renin release.\nMean arterial pressure and renal blood flow responses to NPY (10 microg/kg, administered intravenously) were measured in five anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats before and after BIBO3304TF administration to test the Y-1 antagonist BIBO3304TF. In hypertension studies, 28 rats underwent left renal artery clipping. Of these, 13 were implanted with a mini-osmotic pump for continuous BIBO3304TF infusion (0.3 microg/h, administered intravenously); the other 15 underwent sham implantation. Systolic blood pressure was then monitored for 4 weeks. Finally, in vitro renin release was measured from renal cortical slices (n = 6-12) incubated with NPY (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L) or NPY plus the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-4) mol/L).\nBIBO3304TF attenuated the NPY-induced increase in mean arterial pressure by 54% (P <.02) and the NPY-induced decrease in renal blood flow by 38% (P <.05). In 4-week hypertension studies, systolic blood pressure in clipped controls increased from 130 +/- 3 mm Hg to 167 +/- 6 mm Hg (P <.01), whereas BIBO3304TF-treated rats had no significant increase (125 +/- 3 mm Hg to 141 +/- 8 mm Hg). Final systolic blood pressure was 26 mm Hg lower in BIBO3304TF-treated rats than in controls (P <.01). In renal cortical slices, no NPY effect was observed in basal or isoproterenol-stimulated renin release.\nThe Y-1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304TF attenuated acute pressor responses to NPY and blunted the development of two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertension in rats. NPY may contribute to the hypertensive response in this renovascular hypertension model. Our in vitro data do not suggest that this is due to NPY enhancement of renin release.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of insertion of endovascular stents and the precision of an open-field interventional magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) system in an in vivo model.\nA feasibility study was undertaken at a university-affiliated hospital. Three male piglets with an average age of 6 months and a weight between 70 and 77 kg and two 3-month-old male piglets that weighed 40 to 44 kg were anesthetized. The five piglets underwent placement of nitinol stents inserted through the right femoral artery, under the guidance of a SIGNA-SP 0. 5T open-configuration iMRI unit. With a dedicated high-resolution near-real-time MRI sequence, the stent was guided and deployed onto a predefined target.\nThe main outcome measures were the duration of the procedure from the beginning of positioning to the end of deployment of the stent, the final position of the stent in relation to the target on the iMRI screen, and comparison with autopsy findings. Three stents were deployed within the aorta at the level of the renal arteries, and two were deployed within the right iliac artery just below the aortic trifurcation. The average duration of the endovascular deployment was 13 minutes. There was an agreement of 0.6 mm in the position of the stent as observed on iMR images and found at autopsy. When the piglets were sacrificed, the average distance between the stents and the predefined target was 7. 8 mm, mostly because of the migration of one stent. Axial views allowed for accurate determination of stent impaction on the vascular wall.\nThis study confirms the feasibility of stent deployment under near-real-time MRI guidance. It also emphasizes some inherent characteristics that hold promise with regard to other conventional techniques: stents and vascular structures are visualized in near-real-time in any desired plane, and the technique is performed without the potential adverse effects of ionizing radiations and iodinated contrast agents.",

We hypothesized that arteriovenous bridge graft patency could be improved in patients with disadvantaged venous outflow by preoperative venous duplex mapping.\nThe charts of 114 patients who underwent 115 prosthetic arteriovenous bridge grafts were reviewed. Disadvantaged venous outflow was defined on the basis of any combination of prior arteriovenous bridge graft, multiple venipunctures, and clinical examination. Patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of disadvantaged venous outflow. Three groups were analyzed: those with normal venous outflow who had an initial arteriovenous bridge graft (NML), those with disadvantaged venous outflow who had only a clinical examination before redo arteriovenous bridge graft (REDO/DVO), and those with disadvantaged venous outflow who underwent preoperative duplex scanning venous evaluation (MAP/DVO). Life table primary and secondary 12-month patency rates were compared by means of log-rank analysis.\nLife table analysis yielded 6-month primary patency rates of 65.9% +/- 5.7%, 66.4% +/- 7.3%, and 43.8% +/- 10.9% for NML, MAP/DVO, and REDO/DVO, respectively. The secondary patency rates at 6 months for NML (91.9% +/- 3.4%) and MAP/DVO (91.1% +/- 4. 9%) were statistically equivalent, and both were significantly better than the patency for REDO/DVO (75.0% +/- 10.0%; P =.004 and P =.04, respectively). This trend persisted beyond 12 months.\nPreoperative evaluation of venous anatomy in patients with disadvantaged venous outflow results in an arteriovenous bridge graft patency comparable to that seen in patients undergoing initial arteriovenous bridge grafts. Vein mapping improves arteriovenous bridge graft durability in the patient with disadvantaged venous outflow by allowing the surgeon to select venous return that is in direct continuity with the central venous system.",

    "abstract": "Resolution of venous thrombi is accompanied by an ingrowth of capillaries, which appears to be analogous to angiogenesis in other tissues. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are major regulators of angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the temporal changes and the location of VEGF and bFGF expression in a rat model of venous thrombus resolution.\nThrombi were induced in the inferior venae cavae of rats by creating a stenosis to reduce blood flow by 80% to 90%. Thrombi, adjacent inferior vena cava wall, and systemic blood were collected at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after thrombus generation (n = 9). Sham operations were performed (n = 5), and blood was collected at 1, 3, and 7 days. VEGF and bFGF were measured with specific immunoassays, and levels in tissues were expressed as picogram per milligram soluble protein. Tissues from two animals that were humanely killed 7 days after thrombus formation were prepared for histological examination. Immunohistochemistry was performed by the use of antibodies against VEGF, bFGF, and ED-1 (a monocyte/macrophage marker).\nLaminated thrombi were reliably produced with a median weight at 1 day of 39 mg (range, 23-63 mg). There was a significant increase in thrombus VEGF concentration between 1 day (median, 247; range, 0-514) and 7 days (median, 556; range, 254-1741) (P =.02). There was no difference between the seventh day and subsequent days. There was a positive linear correlation between thrombus bFGF concentration and time (R = 0.74, P <.0001), with a more than 300-fold increase in bFGF concentration over the 28 days of the study. VEGF and bFGF concentrations in the adjacent vena caval wall did not change significantly with time. The serum VEGF was significantly raised at 1 day (median, 5520 pg/mL; range, 4040-7912 pg/mL) and 3 days (median, 3880 pg/mL; range, 2564-7232 pg/mL) compared with 7 days (median, 1790 pg/mL; range, 232-3228 pg/mL) (P <.0001). Similar changes in the serum VEGF also developed in the sham-operated animals. The serum bFGF (day 1 median, 15.5 pg/mL; range, 1-42 pg/mL) did not change with time. Immunohistochemistry showed that the VEGF antigen was localized to monocytes, endothelial cells, and spindle-shaped cells within the thrombus. The bFGF antigen was localized to mononuclear cells and spindle-shaped cells and was also present in the extracellular matrix.\nVEGF and bFGF are found in organizing thrombi and have characteristic temporal expression patterns, which suggest that they have a role in thrombus resolution. Augmenting angiogenic growth factor expression may enhance thrombus recanalization, thus reducing long-term complications.",

There was a positive linear correlation between thrombus bFGF concentration and time (R = 0.74, P <.0001), with a more than 300-fold increase in bFGF concentration over the 28 days of the study. VEGF and bFGF concentrations in the adjacent vena caval wall did not change significantly with time. The serum VEGF was significantly raised at 1 day (median, 5520 pg/mL; range, 4040-7912 pg/mL) and 3 days (median, 3880 pg/mL; range, 2564-7232 pg/mL) compared with 7 days (median, 1790 pg/mL; range, 232-3228 pg/mL) (P <.0001). Similar changes in the serum VEGF also developed in the sham-operated animals. The serum bFGF (day 1 median, 15.5 pg/mL; range, 1-42 pg/mL) did not change with time. Immunohistochemistry showed that the VEGF antigen was localized to monocytes, endothelial cells, and spindle-shaped cells within the thrombus. The bFGF antigen was localized to mononuclear cells and spindle-shaped cells and was also present in the extracellular matrix.",

    "abstract": "External pneumatic compression (EPC) is an effective means of prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis. However, its mechanism remains poorly understood. Understanding of the biological consequences of EPC is an important goal for optimizing performance of the EPC-generating device and providing guidance for clinical use. We present a new in vitro cell culture system (Venous Flow Simulator) that simulates blood flow and vessel collapse conditions during EPC, and we examine the influence of these factors on endothelial cell (EC) fibrinolytic activity and vasomotor function.\nAn in vitro cell culture system was designed to replicate the hemodynamic shear stress and vessel wall strain associated with induced blood flow during different modes of EPC. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in the system and subjected to intermittent flow, vessel collapse, or a combination of the two. The biologic response was assessed through changes in EC morphology and the expression of fibrinolytic factors tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, profibrinolytic receptor (annexin II), and vasomotor factors endothelial nitric oxide synthase and endothelin-1.\nThe cells remained attached and viable after being subjected to intermittent pulsatile flow (F) and tube compression (C). In F and F + C, cells aligned in the direction of flow after 6 hours. Northern blot analysis of messenger RNA shows that there is an upregulation of tissue plasminogen activator expression (1.95 +/- 0.19 in F and 2.45 +/- 0.46 in FC) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression (2.08 +/- 0.25 in F and 2.11 +/- 0.21 in FC). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, annexin II, and endothelin 1 show no significant change under any experimental conditions. The results also show that pulsatile flow, more than vessel compression, influences EC morphology and function.\nEffects on ECs of intermittent flow and vessel collapse, either individually or simultaneously, were simulated with an in vitro system of new design. Initial results show that intermittent flow associated with EPC upregulates EC fibrinolytic potential and influences factors altering vasomotor tone. The system will facilitate future studies of EC function during EPC.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the technique of a variation of closed external venous valve repair (transcommissural valvuloplasty), its complication rate, and duplex scan durability.\nThe \"blind\" transcommissural valve repair of the vein was performed by placing transluminal sutures along the valve attachment lines, which simultaneously closed the valve attachment angle and also tightened the valve cusps. A total of 179 successfully repaired valve sites of 141 limbs in 129 patients were followed up 1 to 42 months through clinical observation and with duplex Doppler ultrasound scan.\nPostoperative complications (< 30 days) occurred in 12 (9%) of 141 limbs: superficial (1) and deep (1) wound infection, large wound hematoma (4), seroma (1), and deep vein thrombosis (5), with associated pulmonary embolus in one patient. Seventy-eight percent (reflux time </= 0.5 seconds) and 81% (reflux time </= 1.0 seconds) of valve sites were competent. The cumulative competency rate at 30 months was 59% and 63%, respectively. The cumulative ulcer recurrence-free interval was 63% at 30 months (n = 92). The pain score and swelling grade substantially improved.\nTranscommissural valvuloplasty is a safe procedure with low morbidity. It is relatively rapid and simple to perform, and its competency rates are comparable to those of internal valvuloplasty. Advantages over the internal repair are that venotomy is not required, repair can be extended to small-caliber veins, and multiple valve stations can be repaired in a single stage.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of APG in predicting clinical outcome after venous surgery for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).\nSeventy-three extremities in 71 patients with Class 3 through 6 CVI were assessed preoperatively with CEAP (c linical, e tiologic, a natomic, p athophysiologic) criteria, standing reflux duplex ultrasound scan, and APG with measurements of preoperative venous filling index (VFI), venous volumes, ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction. After surgical treatment of the affected limbs, repeat APG studies were obtained within 6 weeks. Established venous reporting standards were used for follow-up to calculate clinical symptom scores (CSSs) in each patient.\nSuperficial venous reflux occurred alone in 24 limbs or in conjunction with perforator incompetence in 26 limbs. Deep and superficial reflux, with or without perforator incompetence, was found in 16 limbs, and seven limbs had isolated deep insufficiency. Follow-up was available in 60 of 71 patients (mean period, 44.3 months). Postoperative APG demonstrated significant hemodynamic changes after surgery as measured with VFI, venous volumes, ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction. Mean CSSs decreased from 7.35 +/- 0.56 preoperatively to 1.79 +/- 0.32 at late follow-up after surgery (P <.001). With the use of logistic regression, the parameter correlating most closely with clinical outcome was the VFI. A normal postoperative VFI (</= 2 mL/s) predicted a good clinical outcome (CSS </= 2) in follow-up patients, with a positive predictive value of 94%, a specificity of 89%, and a sensitivity of 70%.\nNormalization of the VFI after venous surgery for CVI is predictive of a good clinical outcome. This APG measurement may be a useful parameter to predict adequacy of surgery in patients with venous insufficiency.",

Extremities with isolated reflux in the LSV system were selected for this study. Limbs with perforating venous reflux connected to this system only were also included. Limbs that had marked reflux in the greater saphenous or deep vein, that had a documented history of deep venous thrombosis, and that previously underwent surgery or sclerotherapy were excluded. The clinical severity of the limbs was graded with the CEAP classification system.\nThere were 226 limbs in 200 patients with reflux in the LSV system; 61% were female patients with a mean age of 49 years (range, 18-82 years). There were 174 patients (87%) with unilateral and 26 with bilateral disease, and 41% of the limbs belonged in CVD class 2, 26% in class 3, 12% in class 4, 3.5% in class 5, and 3% in class 6. Classes 0 and 1 were present in 14.5% of the limbs. Symptoms were present in 139 limbs (61.5%). Some degree of ache or burning sensation was the most frequent symptom (41%), followed by itching (32%), heaviness (29%), cramps (24%), and restless limbs (18%). Reflux in the main trunk of the LSV was the most prevalent (177 limbs [78%]), followed by the saphenopopliteal junction (146 limbs [64.6%]), the vein of Giacomini (39 limbs [17%]) and the gastrocnemial vein (23 limbs [10%]). Reflux involving both the saphenopopliteal junction and the LSV was seen in 50% of limbs, but almost any other combination of reflux was present, which indicated the complexity of this system. Perforator vein incompetence was detected in 56 limbs (25%). We found 83 perforator veins, resulting in a mean of 1.5 veins per limb. Both the number of incompetent perforator veins and the extent of superficial reflux correlated with clinical severity. Four main types of termination of the LSV were identified with at least nine variations. The LSV was duplicated for at least half of its length in five limbs (2.2%). Nonsaphenous reflux was detected in seven limbs (3.1%). Superficial vein thrombosis in the LSV system was found in eight limbs (3.5%), and in the gastrocnemial vein it was found in four (1.8%).\nIsolated LSV system incompetence can cause the entire range of signs and symptoms of CVD. Clinical deterioration is associated with a longer extent of reflux and perforator incompetence. Classes 2 to 4 are the most frequent clinical presentations, whereas classes 5 and 6 are uncommon. The complex anatomy of this system and the great variation in the patterns of reflux warrant the use of color flow duplex scanning before planning treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the added effect of extended saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) ligation when the greater saphenous vein (GSV) has been eliminated from participating in thigh reflux by means of endovenous obliteration. GSV obliteration, unlike surgical stripping, can be done with or without SFJ ligation to isolate and study SFJ ligation's specific contribution to treatment results.\nSixty limbs treated with SFJ ligation and 120 limbs treated without high ligation were selected from an ongoing, multicenter, endovenous obliteration trial on the basis of their having primary varicose veins, GSV reflux, and early treatment dates.\nFive (8%) high-ligation limbs and seven (6%) limbs without high ligation with patent veins at 6 weeks or less were excluded as unsuccessful obliterations. Treatment significantly reduced symptoms and CEAP clinical class in both groups (P =.0001). Recurrent reflux developed in one (2%) of 49 high-ligation limbs and eight (8%) of 97 limbs without high ligation by 6 months (P =.273). New instances of reflux did not appear thereafter in 57 limbs followed to 12 months. Recurrent varicose veins occurred in three high-ligation limbs and four limbs without high ligation by 6 months and in one additional high-ligation limb and two additional limbs without high ligation by 12 months. Actuarial recurrence curves were not statistically different with or without SFJ ligation (P >.156), predicting greater than 90% freedom from recurrent reflux and varicosities at 1 year for both groups.\nThese early results suggest that extended SFJ ligation may add little to effective GSV obliteration, but our findings are not sufficiently robust to warrant abandonment of SFJ ligation as currently practiced in the management of primary varicose veins associated with GSV vein reflux.",

    "abstract": "The current commercially available sequential intermittent pneumatic compression device used for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis has a constant cycle of 11 seconds' compression and 60 seconds' deflation. This deflation period ensures that the veins are filled before the subsequent cycle begins. It has been suggested that in some positions (eg, semirecumbent or sitting) and with different patients (eg, those with venous reflux), refilling of the veins may occur much earlier than 60 seconds, and thus a more frequent cycle may be more effective in expelling blood proximally. The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of a new sequential compression system (the SCD Response Compression System), which has the ability to detect the change in the venous volume and to respond by initiating the subsequent cycle when the veins are substantially full.\nIn an open controlled trial at an academic vascular laboratory, the SCD Response Compression System was tested against the existing SCD Sequel Compression System in 12 healthy volunteers who were in supine, semirecumbent, and sitting positions. The refilling time sensed by the device was compared with that determined from recordings of femoral vein flow velocity by the use of duplex ultrasound scan. The total volume of blood expelled per hour during compression was compared with that produced by the existing SCD system in the same volunteers and positions.\nThe refilling time determined automatically by the SCD Response Compression System varied from 24 to 60 seconds in the subjects tested, demonstrating individual patient variation. The refilling time (mean +/- SD) in the sitting position was 40.6 +/- 10. 0 seconds, which was significantly longer (P <.001) than that measured in the supine and semirecumbent positions, 33.8 +/- 4.1 and 35.6 +/- 4.9 seconds, respectively. There was a linear relationship between the duplex scan-derived refill time (mean of 6 readings per leg) and the SCD Response device-derived refill time (r = 0.85, P <. 001). The total volume of blood (mean +/- SD) expelled per hour by the existing SCD Sequel device in the supine, semirecumbent, and sitting positions was 2.23 +/- 0.90 L/h, 2.47 +/- 0.86 L/h, and 3.28 +/- 1.24 L/h, respectively. The SCD Response device increased the volume expelled to 3.92 +/- 1.60 L/h or a 76% increase (P =.001) in the supine position, to 3.93 +/- 1.55 L/h or a 59% increase (P =. 001) in the semirecumbent position, and to 3.97 +/- 1.42 L/h or a 21% increase (P =.026) in the sitting position.\nBy achieving more appropriately timed compression cycles over time, the new SCD Response System is effective in preventing venous stasis by means of a new method that improves on the clinically documented effectiveness of the existing SCD system. Further studies testing its potential for improved efficacy in preventing deep venous thrombosis are justified.",

Subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding symptoms (heaviness/tension, a feeling of swelling, aching, restless legs, cramps, itching, tingling) and underwent duplex ultrasound examination of the superficial and deep venous systems of both legs. Reflux of 0.5 seconds or greater was considered pathologic. Deep venous reflux was defined as reflux in at least the popliteal vein.\nThere was a significant positive relationship between isolated superficial reflux and the presence of heaviness/tension (P <.025, both legs) and itching (P =.002, left leg) in women. Isolated superficial reflux in men was not significantly positively associated with any symptom. Isolated deep venous reflux was not significantly related to any symptom in either leg in either sex.

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine whether duplex scanning (DS) alone, compared with ascending phlebography (AP) and descending phlebography (DP), would have been sufficient to guide treatment of severe chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), CEAP Clinical Classes 5 and 6.\nBeginning in 1994, patients presenting to the VA Sierra Nevada Vascular Clinic with ulceration due to CVI, CEAP Clinical Classes 5 and 6, were examined with DS, AP, and DP. Phlebography mainly guided surgical interventions. The ability of DS findings to select surgical interventions, with the aims of diversion of reflux from area of trophic skin or reduction of global venous hypertension was compared with phlebography. Of the 33 male patients (age, 29-70 years; average, 55 years) considered for operative interventions between January 1994 and November 1999, 30 were selected for operative treatment.\nDS was 100% sensitive and specific for detection of complete occlusion of the superficial femoral vein (10/10) and for saphenous incompetence; sensitivity was 95% (19/20); and specificity was 100%. However, DS failed to reveal subtle changes in recanalized femoral veins because of prior thrombophlebitis, which was uncovered by AP in six of 23 patent femoral veins. There were 16 positive findings on AP of residual thrombophlebitis, of which six were not read on DS. Sensitivity was 63%, specificity was 100%, the positive predictive value was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 53%. Reflux grading with DP agreed with DS in 23 of 33 cases or varied by one grade in five of 33 cases: sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 75%; positive predictive value, 96%; and negative predictive value, 37%. Kistner grade 4 reflux involving the superficial femoral and popliteal veins was noted by DP in five of the 33 cases when DS described reflux as \"moderate.\" Incompetent superficial femoral vein valve stations in the upper third of the vein, which caused primary reflux, were clearly defined by DP in four of 33 cases; valve location was not well defined by DS. Below-knee perforator identification with DS was difficult; this was related to the severity of lipodermatosclerosis and the presence of ulceration. The number of perforators described at operation with subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (n = 13) averaged 6 +/- 2, whereas AP identified an average of 4 +/- 2 in supramalleolar area. In four men, two previously undiagnosed caval and two iliac obstructions were detected with AP; one was corrected with Palma bypass grafting. Follow-up at 4 to 60 months (average, 40 months) showed four ulcer recurrences among 30 patients who were operated on. Two patients underwent repeat operations on the basis of repeated phlebographic study and are cured at this time, one patient was healed with conservative therapy, and one patient is lost to follow-up.\nDS would have been inadequate for identifying surgical targets in CVI, CEAP Clinical Classes 5 and 6. DS overlooked iliac and caval lesions. Potential valveplasty sites, which were only delineated on DP, resulted in four valveplasties in the upper third of the superficial femoral vein for grade 4 reflux. AP localized mid- to upper-leg perforators, but neither AP nor DP detected perforators in the range of 5 to 10 cm above the calcaneus. The net effect of phlebography was a choice for deep interventions in five (17%) of 30 cases, which would not have been possible with DS alone. The identification of iliocaval occlusion influenced the decision, based on prior experience, not to perform distal procedures in three cases.",

    "abstract": "Popliteal venous aneurysms (PVAs) are an uncommon but potentially life-threatening disease because they can be a source for pulmonary emboli (PE). With the widespread use of venous duplex scanning, PVAs are increasingly found in patients with deep or superficial vein insufficiency, and questions have arisen as to the management of these aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to review our experience in the management of PVAs diagnosed in patients with PE and in patients with chronic venous diseases.\nTwenty-five patients with PVAs were treated in two centers between 1985 and 1999. There were 20 women and five men, with an average age ranging from 33 to 79 years (mean age, 59 years). Twenty-four percent (6/25) presented with PE, and 76% (19/25) of PVAs were discovered during investigation for chronic venous disease (varicosities, n = 13; post-thrombotic symptoms, n = 6). The diagnosis of PVA was achieved in all cases with venous duplex scanning and phlebography. Aneurysms were located in the proximal popliteal vein (n = 17) and at the saphenopopliteal junction (n = 8). Seventy-two percent (18/25) of PVAs were saccular, and 40% (10/25) had an intraluminal thrombus. Two patients with PE underwent cardiac arrest, with one requiring a pulmonary embolectomy. The Fisher exact test showed a statistically significant correlation between PE and the presence of thrombus (50% vs 7% without thrombus, P =.02). Aneurysms were treated with tangential aneurysmectomy and lateral venorrhaphy (n = 19), resection with end-to-end anastomosis (n = 2), resection with interposition of the greater saphenous vein (n = 2) or the superficial femoral vein (n = 1), and resection with vein transposition (n = 1). Two patients who experienced a PE had an inferior vena cava filter placement before surgical repair of the PVA.\nMean follow-up was 63 months (range, 11-168 months). No operative deaths occurred, and no patient had evidence of a recurrent PE. Postoperative minor complications (20%) included transient common peroneal nerve palsy (n = 2), postoperative hematoma (n = 2), and wound infection (n = 1). Postoperative thrombosis of the surgical repair occurred in three patients, and patency was restored with anticoagulation therapy.\nDespite its rarity, PVAs should be ruled out with venous duplex scanning in patients with PE and in patients presenting with chronic venous diseases. Because of the unpredictable risk of thromboembolic complications, surgical treatment that is accompanied by a low morbidity rate is indicated in all PVAs. Tangential aneurysmectomy with lateral venorrhaphy is the procedure of choice.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among pressures obtained simultaneously in the popliteal, long saphenous, and dorsal foot veins.\nEight limbs were studied. One limb had an isolated popliteal vein reflux, and two had moderate long saphenous vein incompetence. No perforator or short saphenous vein insufficiency was detected. Pressures and recovery times of the popliteal/tibial and long saphenous veins were obtained with cannulation at the ankle level and insertion of catheters with a pressure transducer tip. The dorsal foot vein pressure was measured with the insertion of a scalp needle (14-gauge) connected to an external transducer. During 10 toe stands, recordings were simultaneously made in the three veins at the level of the knee joint, in the middle third of the calf, and 5 to 7 cm above the ankle with all the transducers at the same level (ie, same reference point).\nIn one limb the popliteal/tibial pressure increased at all calf levels, whereas pressures decreased in both saphenous and dorsal foot veins. The pressures decreased in all three systems in the remaining seven limbs. There was no statistical difference between the pressure drop in the long saphenous vein and the deep vein. However, the decrease of the dorsal foot venous pressure was significantly more marked compared with the other two veins at all levels. The recovery time was significantly increased in the long saphenous vein compared with the deep vein; recovery time was further prolonged in the dorsal foot vein.\nThe dorsal foot, long saphenous, and popliteal/posterior tibial veins clearly exhibit different pressure waveforms in response to calf exercise. The postexercise pressure, the percentage pressure drop, and the recovery times are widely different, which indicates that the three veins behave hydraulically as separate compartments in limbs without significant venous insufficiency.",

The postexercise pressure, the percentage pressure drop, and the recovery times are widely different, which indicates that the three veins behave hydraulically as separate compartments in limbs without significant venous insufficiency.",

No perforator or short saphenous vein insufficiency was detected. Pressures and recovery times of the popliteal/tibial and long saphenous veins were obtained with cannulation at the ankle level and insertion of catheters with a pressure transducer tip. The dorsal foot vein pressure was measured with the insertion of a scalp needle (14-gauge) connected to an external transducer. During 10 toe stands, recordings were simultaneously made in the three veins at the level of the knee joint, in the middle third of the calf, and 5 to 7 cm above the ankle with all the transducers at the same level (ie, same reference point).",

    "results": "In one limb the popliteal/tibial pressure increased at all calf levels, whereas pressures decreased in both saphenous and dorsal foot veins. The pressures decreased in all three systems in the remaining seven limbs. There was no statistical difference between the pressure drop in the long saphenous vein and the deep vein. However, the decrease of the dorsal foot venous pressure was significantly more marked compared with the other two veins at all levels. The recovery time was significantly increased in the long saphenous vein compared with the deep vein; recovery time was further prolonged in the dorsal foot vein.",

    "abstract": "The percutaneous steel Greenfield filter (PSGF) is similar in appearance to the titanium Greenfield filter (TGF) but differs in the length and orientation of the attachment hooks and in the over-the-wire delivery system. Because these differences improve ease of insertion and attachment, they may affect patient outcomes and physician practices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the PSGF relative to the TGF and to determine whether there had been a change in physician practices.\nThe Michigan Filter Registry contains data for a prospective cohort of 2188 patients with Greenfield filters. Procedural and long-term outcomes for patients with a PSGF were abstracted. These events were compared with rates for Registry patients who had a TGF. Trends for indication for placement, delivery route, and filter location were also compared with published series.\nSince 1995, 600 PSGFs have been placed in 599 patients. A 1-year mortality rate of 42% left 349 patients available for annual follow-up, and studies were completed for 231 (66%). Periprocedural events occurred in 2.5% of cases with associated morbidity in 1.5%. The rate of new pulmonary embolism was 2.6%, and vena caval patency was 98.3%. The combined rate of new venous thromboembolic events was 12.5%. Left-sided femoral vein placements increased to 20%, and the major indication for filter placement has become prophylaxis (46%).\nThe PSGF is similar to the TGF with respect to patient outcomes, and it provides decreased rates of asymmetry along with excellent fixation. The flexible carrier system has allowed more frequent access through the left femoral vein. The ease of use and favorable patient outcomes have resulted in more frequent placement for prophylactic indications.",

    "abstract": "Therapy to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting from upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) remains controversial despite an increasing incidence of DVT of upper extremity origin. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of 72 superior vena cava Greenfield filters (SVC-GFs) placed in patients at risk for PE arising from UEDVT.\nDuring the past 78 months, we placed SVC-GFs in 72 patients with UEDVT in whom anticoagulation was either deemed contraindicated (n = 67) or proved ineffective in preventing recurrent PE (n = 4) or extension of the thrombus (n = 1). There were 25 male (35%) and 47 (65%) female patients whose ages ranged from 25 to 99 years (mean, 74 years). Follow-up ranged from 10 days to 78 months (mean, 7.8 months). Sequential chest radiographs revealed no filter migration or displacement in 26 patients.\nThirty-four patients died in the hospital of causes unrelated to the SVC filter or recurrent thromboembolism (mean time to death, 20 days). Follow-up of the surviving 38 patients ranged from 1 month to 78 months (mean, 22 months); none of these patients were seen with any evidence of PE. One SVC-GF was incorrectly discharged into the innominate vein and left in place. This vein remains patent 2 months after insertion without evidence of filter migration.\nWe think that insertion of SVC-GFs is a safe, efficacious, and feasible therapy and may prevent recurrent thromboembolism in patients with UEDVT who are resistant to anticoagulation or have contraindications to anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "Plasma markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis have proved sensitive in the initial diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The purpose of this study was to examine the evolution and utility of measuring D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F 1+2) levels after an acute DVT.\nSubjects with DVT confirmed by ultrasonography had quantitative plasma D-dimer and F 1+2 levels determined before anticoagulation. Ultrasound scan and coagulation studies were repeated at 3, 7, and 14 days; 1 month; and every 3 months for 1 year.\nSixty-one patients with a median initial thrombus score of 3 (interquartile range, 2-7) were followed up for 266 days (interquartile range, 91.5-364 days). Initial D-dimer levels were elevated in 92.7% of patients and were associated with thrombus extent (P =.003), whereas F 1+2 levels were increased in 94.5% of patients and were lower in patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis (P =.001). Initial D-dimer (P =.002) and F 1+2 levels (P =.009) were significantly higher in the 26 (43%) patients with recurrent thrombosis during follow-up. Initial D-dimer levels of 2000 ng/mL or greater were predictive of recurrent events after both proximal and isolated calf vein thrombosis. Although interval increases in these markers had little value in detecting recurrent thrombotic events, D-dimer levels of 1000 ng/mL or greater and 500 ng/mL or greater had respective sensitivities of 89.3% and 100% in detecting early and late recurrences. Corresponding specificities were 35.6% and 53.9%.\nInitial D-dimer levels are determined by total thrombus load and remain elevated long after an acute DVT. F 1+2 levels are less sensitive to thrombus score and return to baseline more quickly. Initial levels of these markers may have some utility in predicting the risk of ultrasound scan-documented recurrences, whereas increased D-dimer levels are a sensitive but nonspecific marker of these events.",

Group A consisted of 15 patients who received inelastic compression bandages (Unna boots on the lower leg, adhesive bandages on the thigh), and group B consisted of 15 patients who received thigh-length compression stockings, class II. Group C consisted of 15 patients who underwent bed rest and no compression. All patients received dalteparin, 200 IU/kg per body weight, subcutaneously every 24 hours. The clinical characteristics of the three groups were comparable. Primary end points were the reduction of pain assessed daily with the Visual Analogue Scale and the Lowenberg test, the reduction of leg circumference at the ankle and calf levels, and the improvement of clinical scores. The daily walking distance was measured with a pedometer. Safety parameters were ventilation-perfusion scans and duplex ultrasound scans performed on days 0 and 9.\nThe daily walking distance was between 600 and 12,000 m in the compression groups and averaged 66 m in the bed rest group. The pain level showed a statistically significant reduction starting after the second day in the compression groups (A and B) and after 9 days in the bed rest group C (P <.05). The same was true for the measurement of leg circumference. Improvement of the clinical scores was significantly better in the compression groups compared with the bed rest group (P <.01). There was no significant difference concerning the occurrence of new pulmonary emboli and regression of thrombus diameter. Progression of thrombi in the femoral vein was greater and occurred more frequently in the bed rest group than in the other two groups (P = not significant).\nMobile patients with acute proximal DVT treated with low molecular weight heparin should be encouraged to walk with compression bandages or medical compression stockings. The rate of resolution of pain and swelling is significantly faster when the patient ambulates with compression. The risk of pulmonary embolism is not significantly increased by this approach.",

    "abstract": "Most venous ulcers (VUs) will heal with conventional treatment, which focuses on improving regional venous hemodynamics. This treatment, however, often fails to heal large, recurrent VUs that are associated with severe lipodermatosclerosis (LDS). These complicated ulcers may require correction of local venous hemodynamics and replacement of the surrounding LDS with healthy tissue. We report our experience managing 24 especially difficult VUs with debridement and free flap coverage.\nBetween 1987 and 1997, 25 free flap procedures were performed in 22 patients for 24 recalcitrant VUs. Ulcers had been present for a mean of 5.24 years and had failed to heal with conservative therapy and split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) (mean, 2.2). Eleven patients (46%) had exposed bone, tendon, or joint. At operation the area of LDS was excised, and all perforating veins were ablated. The defects after excision ranged from 100 to 600 cm(2) (mean, 237 cm(2)). The free flap was inset within the defect and covered with an STSG.\nWe healed all 24 ulcers with free tissue transfer (one patient required a second flap after the first failed). There were no deaths. Local complications that required repeat STSG occurred in three (13%) of the 24 successful flap transfers. Four other flaps had minor local complications that healed with local wound care. Follow-up was available for 21 of the 24 successful flap transfers. No recurrent ulcers were identified in the territory of the flap after a mean of 58 months, but three patients had new ulcers in the same leg after 6 to 77 months. Patients with severe complications were hospitalized longer than those with minor or no complications (45.7 vs 12.8 days, P <.01), and their hospital charges were greater ($76,681 vs $30,428, P <.01).\nFree tissue transfer can provide rapid healing and long-term relief from severe VUs that are unable to be treated with conventional therapy. This technique improves venous hemodynamics, removes all liposclerotic tissue, provides an abundant blood supply, and resolves the tissue-related components of chronic ulceration. Although further work is needed to determine the optimal indications, this technique provides a durable treatment for especially recalcitrant ulcers.",

Local complications that required repeat STSG occurred in three (13%) of the 24 successful flap transfers. Four other flaps had minor local complications that healed with local wound care. Follow-up was available for 21 of the 24 successful flap transfers. No recurrent ulcers were identified in the territory of the flap after a mean of 58 months, but three patients had new ulcers in the same leg after 6 to 77 months. Patients with severe complications were hospitalized longer than those with minor or no complications (45.7 vs 12.8 days, P <.01), and their hospital charges were greater ($76,681 vs $30,428, P <.01).",

    "abstract": "Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome (KTS) is a complex congenital anomaly, characterized by varicosities and venous malformations (VMs) of one or more limbs, port-wine stains, and soft tissue and bone hypertrophy. Venous drainage is frequently abnormal because of embryonic veins, agenesis, hypoplasia, valvular incompetence, or aneurysms of deep veins. We previously reported on the surgical management of KTS. In this article, we update our experience.\nTwenty patients with KTS underwent surgical treatment for VMs between July 1, 1987, and January 1, 2000. This group represented 6.9% of 290 patients with KTS who were seen at our institution during this 12.5-year study period. Surgical indications, venous anatomy (determined with duplex scan, contrast phlebography, magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance phlebography), operative procedures, and complications were reviewed, and outcomes were recorded.\nTwelve male and eight female patients (mean age, 23.4 years; range, 7.7-40.6 years) underwent 30 vascular surgical procedures in 21 lower limbs. All 20 patients (100%) had varicose veins or VMs, 13 (65%) had port-wine stains, and 18 (90%) had limb hypertrophy. Pain was the most common complaint, which was present in 16 patients (80%), followed by swelling in 15 (75%), bleeding in 8 (40%), and superficial thrombophlebitis and cellulitis in 3 (15%). Imaging confirmed patent deep veins in 18 patients, hypoplastic femoral vein in 1, and entrapped popliteal veins bilaterally in 1. Four patients (20%) had large persistent sciatic veins (PSVs). The CEAP clinical classification was C-3 for 17 patients (85%), C-4 for 1 patient (5%), and C-6 for 2 patients (10%). Stripping of large lateral veins, avulsion, and excision of varicosities or VMs were performed on all limbs. Three patients required staged resections. The release of entrapped popliteal veins was performed in both limbs of one patient; another underwent a popliteal-saphenous bypass graft. One patient underwent excision of a PSV. Open and endoscopic perforator vein ligation was performed in one patient each. Two patients (12%) had hematomas that required evacuation. No patients had caval filter placement; none had postoperative deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. The mean follow-up was 63.6 months (range, 0-138 months). All patients reported initial improvement, but some varicosities recurred in 10 patients (50%), an ulcer did not heal in one, and a new ulcer developed in one, 8 years after surgery. Three patients underwent reoperation for recurrent varicosities. Follow-up CEAP scores were C-2 in 10 patients (50%), C-3 in 6 patients (30%), C-4 and C-5 in 1 patient each (5%), and C-6 in 2 patients (10%). Clinical scores improved from 4.3 +/- 2.2 to 3.1 +/- 2.3. (P =.03).\nThe management of patients with KTS continues to be primarily nonoperative, but those patients with patent deep veins can be considered for excision of symptomatic varicose veins and VMs. Although the recurrence rate is high, clinical improvement is significant, and reoperations can be performed if needed. Occasionally, deep vein reconstruction, excision of PSVs, or subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery is indicated. Because KTS is rare, patients should receive multidisciplinary care in qualified vascular centers.",

In this article we describe the banding technique we use to constrict the large iliac arteries. Four patients underwent endovascular treatment for AAAs with bifurcated grafts. Five of the eight common iliac arteries were 16 to 20 mm in diameter and were constricted around the endoprosthesis by banding with two cotton tapes through a retroperitoneal access. An angioplasty balloon was used as a counterresistance inside the graft. Completion angiogram and postoperative computed tomographic scans showed no endoleak in all cases. No complications occurred in the follow-up (3-10 months). Banding of the common iliac artery is an efficient procedure for endoluminal correction of AAAs when the diameter of the common iliac arteries is greater than 16 mm and less than 20 mm.",

Prosthetic conduits are frequently prone to failure within their first year of construction, and after one or two revisions, they are left in their thrombosed state as permanent subcutaneous foreign bodies in the extremities. Conventional teaching has regarded these chronically thrombosed grafts to have a benign natural history, and their removal has been considered unnecessary. We describe an unusual late complication of distal thromboemboli from a chronically occluded arteriovenous graft that was implanted 10 years before and appeared as acute hand ischemia.",

In the presence of coexisting intra-abdominal sepsis, traditional therapy would call for aneurysm exclusion and axillofemoral bypass grafting. Consequences of this choice of treatment include limited long-term graft patency and recurrent prosthetic infection. Autogenous deep veins from the lower extremities have demonstrated exceptional patency and resilience to infection when used to replace infected aortic grafts. We now report a case of concomitant open drainage of a pancreatic abscess and repair of a saccular abdominal aortic aneurysm using the superficial femoral-popliteal vein as a conduit.",

    "abstract": "Right-sided aortic arch is a rare variant of the thoracic vascular anatomy that may be accompanied by an aberrant origin of the left subclavian artery. We report a true aneurysm of the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta in a patient with right-sided arch and review previous descriptions of aneurysms of anomalous right-sided aortas. In our patient, the left subclavian artery originated at the junction between the distal arch and the descending thoracic aorta located in the right chest and was aneurysmal (Kommerell's diverticulum); the thoracic aorta was also aneurysmal. Extra-anatomic left subclavian-to-carotid transposition was performed before the intrathoracic procedure. Subsequently, a right thoracotomy provided adequate exposure for repairing the aortic aneurysm and oversewing the aneurysmal origin of the subclavian artery. Because the distal aortic arch was involved, deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest were used. Only five previous instances of true aneurysms of a right-sided aortic arch have been reported; four of these patients underwent operative repair (via bilateral thoracotomy, median sternotomy, or right thoracotomy). We believe that a right thoracotomy provides good exposure and avoids the morbidity associated with bilateral thoracotomy. The reconstruction of the subclavian artery has not previously been reported in this setting. Performing subclavian reconstruction as an extrathoracic procedure before the intrathoracic repair would be expected to reduce the subsequent risk of distal ischemia or subclavian steal without increasing the overall morbidity associated with the procedure.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were designed (1) to evaluate liposome-mediated endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) transfection in vein grafts and (2) to compare intimal and adventitial routes of transfection.\nMale mongrel dogs (N = 36) underwent bilateral femoral artery bypass grafting with the lateral saphenous vein. In each animal one vein was transfected with plasmid (pVR1012) containing the ecNOS gene, and another vein was transfected with plasmid alone (control). Gene transfer was performed from either the intimal surface (Group I, n = 18) or the adventitial surface (Group II, n = 18). In each group there were three transfection subgroups (n = 6 each): (a ) 10 microg/mL naked plasmid DNA, (b ) 10 microg/mL plasmid DNA + liposome (LipofectAMINE PLUS), and (c ) 100 microg/mL plasmid DNA + LipofectAMINE PLUS. Grafts were harvested on the third postoperative day, and the transfection was assessed with molecular techniques and enzyme assay for activity of NOS by conversion of tritiated l-arginine to tritiated l-citrulline. Proliferating cells were quantified with a digital analysis of histologic sections after nuclear antigen Ki-67 (MIB1) immunohistochemistry.\nTransgene was identified with polymerase chain reaction in all ecNOS-transfected grafts, regardless of transfection modality. However, significant transcription of the ecNOS transgene was observed only in Group IIc (mean ecNOS messenger RNA, 8.7+/-1.7 vs. 3.1+/-0.7 x 10(-2) attomole/microL, in transfected compared with control grafts, respectively, P =.01). NOS activity increased approximately twofold in this group (11.58+/-2.1 and 6.3+/-1.0 pmol tritiated l-citrulline per milligram protein per hour in transfected and control grafts, respectively, P = .05). Numbers of proliferating cells did not differ among ecNOS-transfected and control grafts in any transfection group.\nThese results suggest that ecNOS transfection of vein grafts is feasible through intimal and adventitial routes with naked DNA or a liposomal vector. However, efficient transcription of the transgene is evident at postoperative day 3 only after adventitial transfection of 100 microg/mL of the gene.",

    "abstract": "Stenoses in infrageniculate arteries proximal to a lower extremity vein graft may reduce flow velocity through the bypass graft and are thought to predispose to graft occlusion. Repair of these lesions has been recommended to preserve graft function. This study was undertaken to better define the natural history of grafts below inflow lesions and to evaluate the necessity of repair to preserve graft patency.\nFrom 1994 through 1999, patients undergoing lower extremity vein grafts by a single surgeon at a university hospital and an affiliated teaching hospital were placed in a prospective protocol for proximal infrageniculate native artery and graft surveillance through use of duplex scanning. The records of those patients with grafts originating distal to the common femoral artery were evaluated; they form the basis for this report. Arteriograms were obtained before bypass grafting, and no patient had a stenosis greater than 50% diameter reduction proximal to the graft origin. Follow-up scans were obtained from the common femoral artery through the graft and outflow artery. The peak systolic velocity and velocity ratio in an infrageniculate native artery proximal to the graft origin were recorded, as were the location and the time interval since the bypass graft. Repair of these proximal lesions was not performed during the course of this study. Revision of the bypass graft or its anastomoses was undertaken according to preestablished duplex scan criteria.\nDuring this time, 288 autogenous infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed, of which 159 originated below the common femoral artery; of these, 74 were from the superficial femoral artery, 29 from the profunda femoris artery, 49 from the popliteal artery, and 7 from a tibial artery. The maximum peak systolic velocity proximal to the graft origin was more than 250 in 38 arteries (25%) and more than 300 in 26 arteries (16%). The velocity ratio was 3.0 or more in 32 arteries at the same location as the peak systolic velocity and 3.5 or more in 23 arteries (15%), confirming hemodynamically significant stenoses at these sites. The location of peak systolic velocity was the common femoral artery in 81 patients (51%), the superficial femoral artery in 50 (31%), the popliteal artery in 22 (14%), and a tibial artery in 6 (4%). Follow-up ranged from 8 to 60 months (mean, 35 months). During follow-up, 19 patients died, 18 with patent grafts. Overall, nine grafts occluded. One of the occluded grafts had a velocity ratio greater than 3.0; this may have contributed to graft thrombosis. The other occlusions resulted from an unrepaired graft lesion in 2 patients, graft infection in 2 patients, and graft ligation necessitated by below-knee amputation in 2 patients. No cause for the occlusion could be identified in two of the grafts (neither had evidence of proximal arterial stenosis). Assisted primary patency rates were 95% and 91% at 3 and 5 years, respectively.\nFor grafts originating distal to the common femoral artery, stenoses proximal to the graft do not affect bypass graft patency and do not require repair to prevent graft occlusion. Surveillance of these lesions may therefore be unnecessary, inasmuch as the repair of proximal lesions should not be undertaken to preserve graft function.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value and reproducibility of laser Doppler (LD) versus photoplethysmography (PPG) in the measurement of the systolic toe blood pressure.\nToe blood pressure was measured in 60 patients in different stages of peripheral vascular disease with simultaneous digital sampling of PPG and two LD signals, each with a different filter setting (3 second [LD(3)] and 0.03 second [LD(0.03)]), and cuff pressure. These measurements were repeated after 1 week. The signals were analyzed with previous results ignored. The agreement of the PPG and LD pressures and reproducibility after 1 week were assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The agreement variation across the range of pressure values was visually explored by means of difference plots.\nIn 19 legs with a very low pressure only LD could adequately measure the pressure, whereas PPG did not. The ICCs between PPG and LD(3) and LD(0.03) were 0.95 or more. The ICCs of the 1-week reproducibility of the PPG, LD(3), and LD(0.03) pressures were 0.92, 0.88, and 0.86, respectively. The variation was equally distributed across the range of pressures in all three methods.\nLD is a reliable alternative to PPG to measure toe blood pressures. Furthermore, LD is able to measure low pressures, which is relevant in the assessment of the presence of critical ischemia.",

    "abstract": "We compared three commonly used methods of ankle/brachial index (ABI) calculation to determine their relative association with objective measures of leg functioning in peripheral arterial disease.\nThe study design was cross-sectional; the setting was an academic medical center. The participants were 244 men and women, aged 55 years and older, with and without peripheral arterial disease, from a noninvasive vascular laboratory and a general medicine practice. The main outcome measures were walking velocity and endurance, measured with the 4-m walk and the 6-minute walk, respectively. Three methods of ABI calculation were assessed: using the highest arterial pressure within each leg (method #1), using the lowest pressure in each leg (method #2), and averaging the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pressures within each leg (method #3). For each method, we established the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease. We then used regression analyses to identify the ABI calculation method most closely associated with leg functioning. The ABI with the greatest statistical significance and largest regression coefficient was considered most closely associated with leg functioning.\nPeripheral arterial disease prevalence ranged from 47% when method #1 was used to 59% when method #2 was used. When the right and left legs were compared, the leg with the lower ABI, as identified through use of method #3, was most associated with leg functioning. Within the leg with the lower ABI, method #3 was more closely associated with 6-minute walk distance (regression coefficient = 811.5 feet per 1 unit ABI; P<.001) and 4-m walking velocity (regression coefficient = 0.353 m/s per 1 unit ABI; P<.001) than method #1 or method #2.\nThe lower ABI, determined by averaging the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arterial pressures in each leg, is most predictive of walking endurance and walking velocity in peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "The most frequent complication of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) arteriovenous grafts for hemodialysis is thrombotic occlusion due to stenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia. This complication is also known for peripheral bypass grafts. Because the use of a venous cuff at the distal anastomosis improves the patency of peripheral bypass grafts, we considered that it might also improve the patency of PTFE arteriovenous grafts. Therefore, a randomized multicenter trial was carried out to study the effect of a venous cuff at the venous anastomosis of PTFE arteriovenous grafts on the development of stenoses and the patency rates.\nOf the 120 included patients, 59 were randomized for a venous cuff. The incidence of thrombotic occlusion was lower in the cuff group (0.68 per patient-year) than in the no-cuff group (0. 88 per patient-year; P =.0007). However, the primary and secondary patency rates were comparable. The cuff group tended to have fewer stenoses at the venous and arterial anastomoses when examined with duplex scan. Graft failure was higher in patients with an initial anastomosing vein diameter smaller than 4 mm (7 of 18 [39%]) than in those with a vein diameter of 4 mm or larger (16 of 88 [18%]; P =. 052). Local edema, skin atrophy, and obesity yielded a higher risk on graft failure (23% vs 11%).\nA venous cuff at the venous anastomosis of PTFE arteriovenous grafts for hemodialysis reduced the incidence of thrombotic occlusions; stenosis at the venous anastomosis was reduced. However, this did not result in a better patency rate. Therefore, the venous cuff should not be used routinely. Initial vein diameter and local problems (edema, obesity, or skin atrophy) appear to be the most important risk factors for graft failure.",

We initiated a randomized, prospective study to determine whether a Tyrell vein collar at the venous anastomosis of forearm loop arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) would improve patency.\nPatients who required new forearm AVGs were randomized to (1) a standard end-to-side graft-vein anastomosis (control group) or (2) a Tyrell vein collar between the graft and the vein (study group). End points were (1) graft thrombosis, (2) graft removal and ligation, or (3) inadequate graft function. Randomization of 75 subjects was planned.

Each imaging modality was evaluated for technical adequacy and for documentation of aneurysm size, endoleak, and graft patency. In concurrent scan pairs, accuracy of duplex scanning was compared with CT.\nA total of 268 CT scans and 214 duplex scans were obtained at intervals of 1 to 30 months after endovascular aneurysm repair (mean follow-up interval, 9+/-7 months). All CT scans were technically adequate, and 198 (93%) of 214 duplex scans were technically adequate for the determination of aneurysm size, presence of endoleak, and graft patency. Concurrent (within 7 days of each other) scan pairs were obtained in 166 instances in 76 patients (1-6 per patient). The maximal transverse aneurysm sac diameter measured with both methods correlated closely (r = 0.93; P <.001) without a significant difference on paired analysis. In 92% of scans, measurements were within 5 mm of each other. Diagnosis of endoleak on both examinations correlated closely (P <.001), and compared with CT, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value of 94%, and a negative predictive value of 90%. Discordant results occurred in 8% of examinations, and in none of these was the endoleak close to the attachment sites or associated with aneurysm expansion. An endoleak was demonstrated on both tests in all eight patients who had an endoleak judged severe enough to warrant arteriography.

Wallstents were used in all patients with selective predilatation. Cerebral protection devices were used in 25 of these patients. Primary end points were perioperative neurologic complications and mortality. Data were collected prospectively.\nThe overall combined end point of all neurologic deficits and death rate was 4.34%. Two neurologic events (one transient ischemic attack and one minor stroke) occurred in the unprotected group (9.53%) versus none in the group with cerebral protection. This difference is not statistically significant. The mortality rate was 0% for both groups. On an intention to treat basis, the overall technical success rate for carotid angioplasty was 97.8%, and for placement of cerebral protection devices it was 100%. An important number of particles of different sizes were captured in all cases in which cerebral protection devices were used.\nExperience has shown that cerebral protection during carotid angioplasty and stenting is technically feasible and appears to be effective in preventing procedure-related neurologic complications.

    "abstract": "Insulin induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, which is an important step in the atherosclerotic process. Recently, a nonpeptidyl fungal metabolite originally referred to as L-783,281, but also known as demethylasterriquinone B-1 (DMAQB-1), was found to have hypoglycemic activity in diabetic mice through interaction with the intracellular beta subunit of the insulin receptor. This study was designed to determine whether DMAQB-1 has an insulin-like proliferative effect on human infragenicular VSMCs.\nHuman infragenicular VSMCs were isolated from diabetic patients undergoing amputations. DMAQB-1 cell culture dose response was measured in both serum-free media and media with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A working concentration of DMAQB-1 that ranged from 0.5 to 500 nmol/L was studied in the presence of varying concentrations of glucose and insulin. The ability of DMAQB-1 to stimulate glucose transport at less than or equal to 100 nmol/L was determined by [(14)C]-2-deoxyglucose uptake. DNA synthesis was used as the marker for proliferative stimulus and detected by [(3)H]-thymidine uptake measured at 24 hours. Analysis of variance was used to compare the results among the groups; a P value less than.05 was considered significant. Polynomial regression was used to calculate the median lethal dose.\nIn normal glucose media (100 mg/dL), various concentrations of DMAQB-1 demonstrated a small but statistically significant decrease in DNA synthesis at 0.5 nmol/L in serum-free media and at 5 nmol/L in media supplemented with 1% FBS. The corresponding median lethal dose was 107 nmol/L in serum-free media and 650 nmol/L in media supplemented with 1% FBS. A DMAQB-1 concentration of 5 nmol/L induced glucose transport that was equivalent to an insulin concentration of 100 microU/mL. In serum-free, high glucose media (200 mg/dL), DMAQB-1 concentrations up to 500 nmol/L did not cause a statistically significant change in DNA synthesis. When serum-free, high glucose media was combined with mild (100 microU/mL) or moderate (250 microU/mL) concentrations of insulin, DMAQB-1 caused no statistically significant increase in DNA synthesis.\nNontoxic doses of DMAQB-1 can induce glucose transport equivalent to insulin in the physiologic range. However, DMAQB-1 does not have an insulin-like proliferative effect on human VSMCs in normal-glucose, high-glucose, or high-insulin environments.",

    "abstract": "Uteroglobin is a protein with potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. We hypothesize that induction of uteroglobin expression in the artery wall by local adenoviral gene transfer will decrease neointimal hyperplasia in the rat carotid artery after balloon injury.\nSeven male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent balloon injury of the common carotid artery. After the injury, with flow occluded, the artery was instilled with 50 microL of the adenoviral vector encoding uteroglobin gene (Ad.UG) at a concentration of 1.35 x 10(11) pfu/mL (n = 7) or 0.68 x 10(11) pfu/mL (n = 7) (n = 7). Control animals were similarly treated: either an adenovirus encoding for beta-galactosidase gene (Ad.LacZ) at 1 x 10(11) pfu/mL (n = 7) or the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle (n = 6) was used. The solution was allowed to dwell for 20 minutes. The rats were humanely killed after 14 days by perfusion fixation, and the carotid arteries were sectioned for analysis with computerized planimetry. The intima-media area ratios were calculated for each artery and compared with analysis of variance with Bonferroni/Dunn post hoc testing. One additional rat from the PBS, Ad.LacZ, and Ad.UG (1.35 x 10(11) pfu/mL) groups was humanely killed 4 days after treatment for carotid artery protein extraction and Western blotting.\nUteroglobin protein production was confirmed in the Ad.UG-treated arteries with Western blotting. Morphometric analysis showed that the Ad.UG group at 1.35 x 10(11) pfu/mL had a significantly lower intima-media area ratio than both the Ad.LacZ (P =.002) and PBS (P =.004) controls. The Ad.UG group at 0.68 x 10(11) pfu/mL was also significantly different from the Ad. LacZ (P =.003) and PBS (P =.006) controls. There was no statistical difference between the two control groups or between the two Ad.UG groups.\nAdenoviral gene transfer of uteroglobin, delivered intraluminally after arterial injury causes the production of uteroglobin protein and has an inhibitory effect on neointimal accumulation in the rat model.",

    "abstract": "Renal neoplasm (RN) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are occasionally discovered concurrently. The approach to synchronous malignancy and aortic aneurysm is controversial.\nBetween 1981 and 1999, concurrent RN and AAA were diagnosed in 50 patients at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Twenty-three patients were managed conservatively because of small asymptomatic AAA or metastatic disease; these patients were excluded from the study. The remaining 27 patients underwent operative management of both entities with a staged or simultaneous approach, and they form the basis of this article.\nAAA diameter ranged from 4.8 to 13 cm (mean, 6.0+/-1.8 cm). RNs were managed with radical nephrectomy in 11 patients (41%), partial nephrectomy in 10 patients (37%), or both in 6 patients with bilateral renal tumors (22%). The AAA repair was performed at the time of the urologic procedure in 11 patients (41%), before the urologic procedure in 13 patients (48%), or after the urologic procedure in 3 patients (11%). The AAA was addressed with open surgical repair in 24 patients (89%); recently, three patients (11%) underwent endovascular repair of the aneurysm and staged partial nephrectomy. The incidence of major perioperative complications was 23% (6 patients). Acute renal failure was the most common complication (3 [11%]) followed by acute respiratory failure (2 [7.4%]), pulmonary embolism (1 [3.7%]), and stroke (1 [3.7%]). At the mean follow-up of 57 months, there were no graft infections reported. The 5-year overall and cancer-specific survival rates were 62% and 81%, respectively. There was a significant difference in 5-year cancer-specific survival when comparing patients managed simultaneously versus staged (80% versus 35%, P =.007).\nThe concurrent presentation of RN and AAA should not discourage one from treating both entities simultaneously because long-term survival is common. Endovascular repair of AAA holds promise as an attractive strategy in these complex patients.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, there have been numerous advances in our ability to detect and to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). We hypothesized that these advances would lead to (1) an increase in the rate of elective repair and a decrease in the incidence of ruptured AAA (rAAA) and (2) a decrease in operative deaths for both elective AAA (eAAA) and rAAA.\nTo test these hypotheses, we investigated the incidence and outcomes of eAAA and rAAA surgery between 1979 and 1997, using the National Hospital Discharge Survey. This data set is a randomized, stratified sample representing discharges from the nation's acute care, nonfederally funded hospitals. Codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision were used to identify our study population.\nOver the past 19 years, there has been no change in the incidence rate of eAAA repair (range, 44.1-77.9 per 100,000). Moreover, the incidence of rAAAs presenting to the nation's hospitals has not changed (range, 6.6-16.3 per 100,000). There has been no consistent improvement over time in operative deaths associated with either eAAA or rAAA repair (average rates over the study period: eAAA, 5.6%; rAAA, 45.7%). Significant predictors of death from eAAA in patients included an age older than 80 years, African American race, congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes (P<.0001 for all). Significant predictors of death from rAAA in patients included age older than 70 years, African American race, female sex, renal failure, and a hospital bed size more than 500 (P<.05 for all).\nOn a national level, over the past 19 years, our ability to identify and to treat patients with AAA has not improved. Advances in technology and critical care have not affected outcome. Regionalization of care, screening of high-risk populations, and endovascular repair are strategies that might allow further improvement in the outcome of patients with aneurysmal disease.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of an adequate ipsilateral greater saphenous vein, various alternative conduits have been used for the performance of lower extremity revascularization. In this study we compared the effectiveness of all-autogenous arm vein bypass grafts with that of prosthetic grafts.\nSeven hundred forty lower extremity revascularization procedures (506 arm vein, 234 prosthetic) performed between 1990 and 1999 were followed prospectively by means of a computerized vascular registry.\nBypass graft configurations were femoro-above-knee-popliteal (26 arm vein, 100 prosthetic); femoro-below-knee-popliteal (38 arm vein, 29 prosthetic); femorotibial (174 arm vein, 55 prosthetic); femoropedal (23 arm vein, 2 prosthetic); popliteotibial/pedal (101 arm vein, 1 prosthetic); and extension \"jump\" grafts (144 arm vein, 47 prosthetic). The indications for surgery were limb salvage (98.0% arm vein, 89.7% prosthetic) and disabling claudication (2.0% arm vein, 10.3% prosthetic). The mean follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1 month-7.4 years). Overall patient survival at 4 years was 54% (arm vein) and 69% (prosthetic). Cumulative patency varied with graft configuration. The 1-year primary patency rates for femorotibial grafts were 81.6% +/- 3.6% (arm vein) and 58.0% +/- 8.4% (prosthetic); the 3-year rates were 68.3% +/- 6.1% (arm vein) and 41.1% +/- 9.8% (prosthetic) (P<.01). The 1-year limb salvage rates for femorotibial grafts were 91.1% +/- 2.8% (arm vein) and 69.1% +/- 8. 8% (prosthetic); the 3-year rates were 81.4% +/- 5.6% (arm vein) and 63.2% +/- 10.3% (prosthetic) (P =.02). The 1-year primary patency rates for femoro-below-knee-popliteal grafts were 92.9% +/- 5.1% (arm vein) and 83.4% +/- 8.0% (prosthetic); the 3-year rates were 72.8% +/- 10.1% (arm vein) and 55.5% +/- 12.1% (prosthetic) (P=.05). The 1-year limb salvage rates for femoro-below-knee-popliteal grafts were 100% (arm vein) and 91.3% +/- 7.0% (prosthetic); the 3-year rates were 94.7% +/- 7.3% (arm vein) and 75.3% +/- 14.6% (prosthetic) (P = NS).\nIn this study autogenous arm vein grafts demonstrated increased patency and limb salvage, compared with prosthetic grafts. These increases achieved statistical significance in the femoro-below-knee-popliteal and femorotibial configurations. An effort to use an all-autogenous vein conduit is justified on the basis of these results; however, if no autogenous vein is available, prosthetic grafts provide a reasonable alternative to primary amputation.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience with pedal branch artery (PBA) bypass to confirm the role of these target arteries for limb salvage and to identify patient and technical factors that may be associated with graft patency and limb salvage.\nIn this retrospective study we analyzed 24 vein grafts to PBAs performed from 1988 to 1998 for limb salvage in 23 patients who had no suitable tibial, peroneal, or dorsal pedal target arteries. These PBA grafts were compared with 133 perimalleolar posterior tibial, defined at or below the ankle, or dorsalis pedis bypass grafts performed contemporaneously; the Kaplan-Meier life table was used in the analysis of graft patency and limb salvage. Life table analyses and logistic regression analysis of prognostic patient variables were also performed.\nThe PBA bypass represented 3% of infrainguinal revascularizations for chronic critical limb ischemia at our institution over the study period. Patients who received PBA bypasses were more likely to be male (92% vs. 69%, P =.02) with lower incidences of overt coronary artery disease (33% vs. 50%, P =.12) and stroke (0% vs 15%, P =.04), and a higher incidence of end-stage renal disease (21% vs 8%, P =.06) than those undergoing perimalleolar bypass. Seventeen percent of PBA bypasses were performed with the anterior lateral malleolar artery, a vessel not previously described as a common bypass target. Two-year primary patency and limb salvage for PBA versus perimalleolar bypass was 70% versus 80% (P =.16) and 78% versus 91% (P = .28), respectively. Patency and limb salvage rates were no different in bypasses with above-knee or below-knee inflow arteries.\nAn autogenous vein bypass to the PBA, though rarely required, provides acceptable primary patency and limb salvage when compared with perimalleolar tibial artery bypass when no suitable, more proximal target arteries are available. The PBA bypass should be considered before major amputation is undertaken.",

    "abstract": "When managing a new neurologic deficit after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), the surgeon is often preoccupied with determining the cause of the problem, requesting diagnostics tests, and deciding whether the patient should be surgically reexplored. The goal of this study was to analyze a series of perioperative neurologic events and to determine if careful analysis of their timing and mechanisms can predict which cases are likely to improve with reoperation.\nA review of 2024 CEAs performed from 1985 to 1997 revealed 38 patients who manifested a neurologic deficit in the perioperative period (1.9%). These cases form the focus of this analysis.\nThe causes of the events included intraoperative clamping ischemia in 5 patients (13.2%); thromboembolic events in 24 (63.2%); intracerebral hemorrhage in 5 (13.2%); and deficits unrelated to the operated artery in 4 (10.5%). Neurologic events manifesting in the first 24 hours after surgery were significantly more likely to be caused by thromboembolic events than by other causes of stroke (88.0% vs. 12.0%, P<.002); deficits manifesting after the first 24 hours were significantly more likely to be related to other causes. Of 25 deficits manifesting in the first 24 hours after surgery, 18 underwent immediate surgical reexploration. Intraluminal thrombus was noted in 15 of the 18 reexplorations (83. 3%); any technical defects were corrected. After the 18 reexplorations, in 12 cases there was either complete resolution of or significant improvement in the neurologic deficit that had been present (66.7%).\nCareful analysis of the timing and presentation of perioperative neurologic events after CEA can predict which cases are likely to improve with reoperation. Neurologic deficits that present during the first 24 hours after CEA are likely to be related to intraluminal thrombus formation and embolization. Unless another etiology for stroke has clearly been established, we think immediate reexploration of the artery without other confirmatory tests is mandatory to remove the embolic source and correct any technical problems. This will likely improve the neurologic outcome in these patients, because an uncorrected situation would lead to continued embolization and compromise.",

CE-P was preferred for patients who required temporary shunting. In the E-CE group an additional proximal 2-cm arteriotomy was made in the common carotid artery (CCA) in 79 patients, a longer arteriotomy was made for extensive involvement of the CCA in 14 patients, and the internal carotid artery was advanced proximally as a patch for the CCA arteriotomy closure in 14 patients. Stenoses of > 50% that were present at 1 month were considered residual, and those of > 50% that were present at 1 year but not at 1 month were considered recurrent.\nThere were five (1.8%) postoperative strokes (four after CE-P and one after E-CE, P = not significant). At 30 days there were 28 patients (10.2%) with residual stenoses > 50% (11 patients [10.2%] in the E-CE group and 17 patients [10.1%] in the CE-P group; P = not significant). The incidence of recurrent lesions of more than 50% was similar (4.6% for E-CE vs 4.7% for CE-P).\nThe pattern of residual lesions and recurrent stenoses differs with each technique of endarterectomy. Proximal stenoses are more common after E-CE, and distal stenoses are more common after CE-P at both 1 month and 1 year.

    "abstract": "In several nonrandomized studies investigators have reported on the value of postoperative carotid duplex surveillance (PCDS) with mixed results; however the type of closure was not analyzed in these studies. In this study we analyze the frequency and timing of postoperative carotid duplex ultrasound scanning according to the type of closure from a randomized carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trial comparing primary closure (PC) versus patching.\nWe randomized 399 CEAs into 135 PCs, 134 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch closures, and 130 vein patch closures (VPCs) with a mean follow-up of 47 months. PCDS was done at 1, 6, and 12 months and every year thereafter (a mean of 4.0 studies per artery). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the rate of > or = 80% restenosis over time and the time frame of progression from < 50%, to 50%-79% and > or = 80% stenosis.\nRestenoses of > or =80% developed in 24 (21%) arteries with PC and nine (4%) with patching. Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom of > or = 80% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 92%, 83%, 80%, 76%, and 68% for PC, respectively, and 100%, 99%, 98%, 98%, and 91% for patching, respectively, (P <.01). Of 56 arteries with 20% to 50% restenosis, two of 28 patch closures and 10 of 28 PCs progressed to 50% to < 80% restenosis (P =.02); none of the patch closures and six of 28 PCs progressed to > or =80% (P =.03). In PCs, the median time to progression from <50% to 50%-79%, < 50% to > or =80%, and 50%-79% to > or = 80% was 42, 46, and 7 months, respectively. Of the 24 arteries with > or =80% restenosis in PC, 10 were symptomatic. Thus, assuming th symptomatic restenosis would have undergone duplex scan examinations regardless, there were 14 asymptomatic arteries (12%) that could have been detected only with PCDS (estimated cost, $139, 200), and those patients would have been candidates for redo CEA. Of the 9 arteries (3 PTFE closures and 6 VPCs) with > or =80% restenosis with patch closures, 6 asymptomatic (4 VPCs and 2 PTFE closures) arteries (3%) could have been detected with PCDS. In patients with normal duplex scan findings at the first 6 months, only four (2%) of 222 patched arteries (two asymptomatic) developed > or = 80% restenosis versus five (38%) of 13 in patients with abnormal duplex scan examination findings (P<.001).\nPCDS is beneficial in patients with PC, but is less beneficial in patients with patch closure. PCDS examinations at 6 months and at 1- to 2-year intervals for several years after PC are adequate. For patients with patching, a 6-month postoperative duplex scan examination with normal results is adequate.",

    "results": "Restenoses of > or =80% developed in 24 (21%) arteries with PC and nine (4%) with patching. Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom of > or = 80% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 92%, 83%, 80%, 76%, and 68% for PC, respectively, and 100%, 99%, 98%, 98%, and 91% for patching, respectively, (P <.01). Of 56 arteries with 20% to 50% restenosis, two of 28 patch closures and 10 of 28 PCs progressed to 50% to < 80% restenosis (P =.02); none of the patch closures and six of 28 PCs progressed to > or =80% (P =.03). In PCs, the median time to progression from <50% to 50%-79%, < 50% to > or =80%, and 50%-79% to > or = 80% was 42, 46, and 7 months, respectively. Of the 24 arteries with > or =80% restenosis in PC, 10 were symptomatic. Thus, assuming th symptomatic restenosis would have undergone duplex scan examinations regardless, there were 14 asymptomatic arteries (12%) that could have been detected only with PCDS (estimated cost, $139, 200), and those patients would have been candidates for redo CEA. Of the 9 arteries (3 PTFE closures and 6 VPCs) with > or =80% restenosis with patch closures, 6 asymptomatic (4 VPCs and 2 PTFE closures) arteries (3%) could have been detected with PCDS. In patients with normal duplex scan findings at the first 6 months, only four (2%) of 222 patched arteries (two asymptomatic) developed > or = 80% restenosis versus five (38%) of 13 in patients with abnormal duplex scan examination findings (P<.001).",
