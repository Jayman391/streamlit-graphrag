    "abstract": "During autogenous vascular grafting endothelial cell damage inevitably occurs. In this study we examined the functional and morphologic integrity of experimental arterial grafts. The right external iliac artery was grafted into the right carotid artery of 12 male New Zealand white rabbits. The left external iliac artery was used as the control artery. Four weeks after surgery, isometric tension studies were performed on rings of control artery and arterial graft. Control arteries and arterial grafts precontracted with norepinephrine demonstrated endothelium-dependent relaxation of 28.3% +/- 5.6% and 16.1% +/- 1.7%, respectively, in response to acetylcholine (5 x 10(-6) mol/L). Both control arteries and arterial grafts contracted in response to norepinephrine, histamine, and serotonin. The median effective dose (ED50) of norepinephrine was 4.1 +/- 1.3 x 10(-7) mol/L for control arteries and 62.1 +/- 17.9 x 10(-7) mol/L for arterial grafts (p less than 0.005). Similarly, arterial grafts were less sensitive to histamine; the ED50 of histamine for control arteries was 4.6 +/- 1.3 x 10(-7) mol/L and 51.4 +/- 13.0 x -7 mol/L for arterial grafts (p less than 0.005). In contrast, reactivity to serotonin was unaltered. The ED50 was 4.1 +/- 1.3 x 10(-7) mol/L for control arteries and 4.5 +/- 1.3 x 10(-7) mol/L for arterial grafts. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed a largely intact endothelial surface. These data are markedly different from our previous findings with vein grafts in which serotonin supersensitivity was associated with an absence of endothelium-mediated relaxation to acetylcholine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic duplex scanning was used to study the rates at which lysis of thrombi, valvular incompetence, and symptoms of the postthrombotic syndrome (edema) developed in 21 patients after deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Lysis of thrombi occurred rapidly in most patients. In 11 of 21 patients (53%), recanalization occurred in all segments by 90 days after presentation. In four patients, extension of the initial DVT occurred between 30 and 180 days, despite treatment with warfarin. Valvular incompetence developed in 13 patients during the study period. The number of patent venous segments with incompetent valves increased from the initial presentation to 180 days, at which time 25% of patent segments contained incompetent valves. Valvular incompetence developed in previously thrombosed segments that were initially competent after recanalization and in segments not previously thrombosed. This suggested that although incompetence may occur as a result of a direct effect of the thrombus on the valve, other mechanisms must also be involved. Patients with edema early after DVT (from 7 to 30 days) were more likely to have residual occlusion than valvular incompetence. The late development of edema (from 90 to 270 days) was more closely correlated with valvular incompetence.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly believed that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) carry cholesterol into the artery wall. In addition, some epidemiologic studies have suggested that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, such as very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), may be much less important than LDLs in atherogenesis. To determine if VLDLs or their metabolic remnants could have a direct role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, we examined lipoproteins isolated from endarterectomy specimens. Atherosclerotic plaque was obtained from eight subjects who underwent aortoiliac endarterectomy (4), aortic aneurysm repair (2), or visceral/renal endarterectomy (2). Plaques were washed extensively, minced, and incubated with a buffered saline solution. Lipoproteins were recovered from this solution via a selected-immunoaffinity column by means of a polyclonal antibody to human LDL (apolipoprotein B-100). Particle sizing from electron photomicrographs of negatively stained specimens indicated that 8% of the lipoprotein particles were the size of plasma VLDL (350 to 800 nm). Thirty-six percent were the size of plasma VLDL remnant particles (250 to 350 nm), and 56% were consistent in size with plasma LDL (175 to 250 nm). We conclude that VLDL- and VLDL remnant-sized particles appear to comprise a significant percentage of the lipoproteins found in human atherosclerotic plaque and could have a direct role in the atherosclerotic process.",

    "abstract": "Reports of all cervicocephalic arteriograms (n = 1836) performed at one institution during a 10-year period were reviewed and the patients were classified into three groups according to the indication for arteriography. Group I included all patients with symptoms or findings compatible with occlusive disease of the carotid or vertebral artery (n = 806). Group II included patients with cerebrovascular symptoms unrelated to carotid or vertebral disease (e.g., patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage) (n = 367). Group III consisted of patients with no evidence of cerebrovascular disease (e.g., patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors) (n = 663). One hundred ten atherosclerotic occlusions of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were found in 106 patients in group I. Fifty-one percent of these patients had a history of stroke before arteriography, 24% had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or amaurosis fugax (AF), and 12% had nonhemispheric symptoms. Only 13% (1.7% of group I patients) were without symptoms. Ninety-one percent of the strokes and 75% of the TIAs or AF were ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion. Seventy-six percent of patients with stroke and 80% with ipsilateral TIAs or AF vs only 29% of patients without symptoms had contralateral stenosis of 60% diameter reduction or greater (p less than 0.003). No occlusions of the ICA occurred in groups II or III. Three hundred forty-six patients in groups II and III were more than 60 years of age. Assuming either Poisson or binomial distributions, the incidence of silent ICA occlusion in the population at large older than 60 years was estimated at less than 1% (p less than 0.03).",

Patients who showed no symptoms of carotid disease had a combined stroke and mortality rate of 2.8%. Surgeons performing fewer than three CEAs per year had a tendency toward a higher complication rate than had surgeons performing more than 12 CEAs a year.

    "abstract": "Surgical correction of renovascular hypertension in children is especially challenging because there is high incidence of bilateral renal artery lesions and stenosis of the abdominal aorta. Seventeen patients with severe hypertension, whose ages ranged from 2 to 16 years (mean 10.2 years), had surgical repair of these lesions from 1974 to 1987. Twenty-nine renal artery lesions were repaired. Twelve (71%) were bilateral, five (29%) were unilateral, and eight patients (47%) had abdominal aortic lesions (midaortic stenosis). Twenty-eight saphenous vein grafts and one splenorenal graft were used to bypass the renal artery lesions. The midaortic lesions were bypassed with Dacron grafts from the superceliac aorta to the aortic bifurcation. No operative deaths occurred. Nineteen of the 28 vein grafts were reinforced with a 6 mm diameter tubular Dacron mesh to prevent aneurysmal degeneration seen in three of nine unsupported vein grafts. Follow-up arteriograms were available in 15 patients up to 11 years after operation (mean 5.0 years). There has been no aneurysmal dilatation in the 19 mesh-supported grafts. The ratio of vein graft diameter to the diameter of the native aorta was 1.25 +/- 0.38 (+/- standard deviation) in unsupported grafts and 0.65 +/- 0.09 in mesh-supported grafts, representing a 92% increased diameter in the unsupported grafts. Three vein grafts (10.3%) required percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for late postoperative vein graft stenoses, but no stenotic lesions have developed at the aortic suture lines. One graft occluded 7 years postoperatively after replacement of an aneurysmal vein graft, and one early postoperative graft occlusion occurred, for a graft failure rate of 7%. Seventy-six percent of patients (13 of 17) are normotensive without medication, and 24% (4 of 17) are considered improved with hypertension controlled with a lower dose of medication. Our results attest to the safety and efficacy of this complicated surgery. Saphenous veins, supported by external Dacron mesh, appear to be a suitable graft material for renal reconstruction in this population.",

    "abstract": "To define the relationship between compliance mismatch and the development of neointimal hyperplasia, one 3 cm segment of common iliac artery was externally banded in seven dogs, thereby fixing the arterial diameter at end diastole. To quantify compliance, end-diastole diameter and its change with pulse pressure were measured by induction angiometry. This technique uses intravascular soft trifilar wire probes introduced through distally placed polytetrafluoroethylene sidearms. Compliance was checked in the banded and contralateral undissected unbanded control iliac arteries at 3 and 6 months, at which times the vessels were fixed by perfusion, excised, and examined histologically. Sustained (6-month) compliance mismatch was successfully induced within the banded segments (p less than 0.0001), and no compliance mismatch was seen in the control segments (p = 0.357). The intima of all banded vessels was virtually indistinguishable from that in controls grossly and histologically. Mild focal intimal thickening, less than 3 cell layers thick involving less than 5% of the vessel circumference, was typically seen in both banded and control vessels (range 6.57 +/- 6.80 micron to 38.86 +/- 57.16 micron). In marked contrast, at the sites of the polytetrafluoroethylene-to-femoral artery anastomosis, near-occlusive neointimal hyperplasia (1714 +/- 415.47 micron) was seen in all animals. Residual lumen area in the banded and control vessels was only minimally abnormal (range 98.65% +/- 2.18% to 99.96% +/- 0.08%). These data indicate that compliance mismatch alone is an insufficient stimulus for the development of neointimal hyperplasia in the canine model.",

    "abstract": "Thirty-nine patients with renal artery aneurysm (RAA) were seen over a period of 15 years. Among 20 women and 19 men, 31 were found to have solitary aneurysms, and eight had multiple RAA. Thirty-three patients had diastolic hypertension; nine of them proved to be of renovascular origin. Of the 18 patients who underwent RAA resection, 13 had reconstruction for treatment of hypertension, three had a solitary functional kidney, one had recurrent flank pain, and one had resection for prevention of rupture in a woman of childbearing age. Six of the 18 patients had aneurysmorrhaphy with primary repair or patching, seven had a resection with an aortorenal bypass, and five patients had six ex vivo renal reconstructions with multiple anastomoses. Nephrectomy was performed in two patients with RAA rupture at the time of childbirth and in one patient with hypertension and RAA in a poorly functioning kidney. Reconstructive procedures for documented renovascular hypertension in seven patients resulted in improvement in all cases. Blood pressure improved in only six of 10 patients operated on with hypertension and no lateralization of renovascular studies. Eighteen patients were observed for one to 16 years without surgery, and none experienced rupture. Resection of RAA is indicated to treat patients with renovascular hypertension, patients with hypertension and a solitary functional kidney, and selected patients with severe hypertension and to prevent rupture in women who may become pregnant. Other patients with asymptomatic RAA can be safely observed clinically without serial arteriograms and without fear of rupture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Administration of intraarterial fibrinolytic agents has been recommended after balloon catheter thrombectomy to reduce retained thrombus and to improve the patency of collateral vasculature. However, the potential for improvement in the viability of skeletal muscle after ischemia as a result of this therapy has not been evaluated. We investigated the effect of intraarterial urokinase (UK) on the salvage of ischemic skeletal muscle in a bilateral, in vivo, isolated gracilis muscle model. In six anesthetized dogs each gracilis muscle was subjected to 5 hours of ischemia by temporary occlusion of the gracilis artery. Before reperfusion, the experimental muscle received an intraarterial infusion of UK (30,000 units) whereas the control muscle received saline solution. Each muscle was then reperfused for 90 minutes. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining demonstrated infarction of 20.2% +/- 8.1% in control muscles compared with 8.6% +/- 6.2% in UK-infused muscles (p less than 0.01). Control muscles gained significantly more weight from edema (33.6 +/- 5.9 gm) than UK-infused muscles (18.2 +/- 4.1 gm; p less than 0.05). Coagulation studies confirmed that an isolated fibrinolytic effect occurred on the experimental side. These studies suggest that intraarterial UK may be a useful adjunctive therapy after revascularization of the acutely ischemic limb and that further clinical trials are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative intraarterial fibrinolytic therapy (IIFT) was employed in 28 patients with acute limb ischemia. In 17 patients, significant residual calf thrombus was demonstrated by completion arteriography after standard balloon catheter thromboembolectomy, whereas in 11, pretreatment arteriography was not obtained. With the patient systemically heparinized, a bolus of fibrinolytic agent was instilled into the distal vessels below an inflow occlusion clamp. Among the 17 patients under angiographic control, arteriography was repeated after 30 minutes and a second bolus was injected if significant residual thrombus was still present. Successful lysis was achieved in 88% of these 17 limbs and streptokinase (SK) and urokinase (UK) were equally effective. The dosage of SK varied between 50,000 and 150,000 units (seven patients) and of UK between 35,000 and 150,000 units (21 patients). Serum fibrinogen levels declined significantly after IIFT (t test; p less than 0.05), but the average level remained within the normal range. Major bleeding developed in two patients, both of whom received SK and underwent a concomitant major abdominal vascular procedure, with a severe fall in fibrinogen values to 10 and 17 mg/dl. A minor groin hematoma occurred in one patient treated with UK. There was a significant difference in the incidence of bleeding between SK (2/7) and UK (1/21) (chi 2; p less than 0.05). Compartment syndrome developed in six limbs (21%). Amputation was required in two patients (7%). There was no correlation between prolongation of ischemia time as a result of IIFT and the incidence of compartment syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Chronic lower-leg edema in patients with venous disorders was studied by means of lymphoscintigraphy. Lymphatic patterns of flow were evaluated prospectively in 26 patients with technetium 99m antimony trisulfide colloid injected subcutaneously in the interdigital web spaces on the feet. Most patients in this study had postphlebitic syndrome, and all of these patients had abnormal lymphoscintigraphic flow patterns. Nine had evidence of lymphatic obstruction, and one had an enhanced flow pattern. Three patients had veins used for distal arterial bypass, and all these veins showed decreased lymphatic flow. Two patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (congenital varicose veins associated with limb elongation, a capillary nevus, and an abnormal deep venous system) had obstruction to lymphatic flow, and two others had normal and enhanced patterns. Normal studies were seen in four of five patients who had veins used for coronary artery bypass grafting. The finding of decreased lymphatic flow in patients appears to be the result of the length of time from an episode of deep venous thrombosis, the occurrence and number of episodes of cellulitis and lymphangitis, and mobilization of the vein for use in distal arterial bypass surgery. This study shows that the edema attributed previously to primary venous disorders may have a significant lymphatic component. The degree of lymphatic obstruction can be determined by lymphoscintigraphy with technetium-labeled antimony trisulfide colloid.",

    "abstract": "We studied the effect of thoracic aortic occlusion and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage on regional spinal cord blood flow and its correlation with neurologic outcome. Using isotope-tagged microspheres, we determined blood flow to the gray and white matter of five regions of the spinal cord in dogs: group I (control), group II (cross-clamp only), group III (cross-clamp plus CSF drainage). At 60 minutes after thoracic aortic occlusion in group II, median gray matter blood flow (GMBF) in the lower thoracic and lumbar cord decreased from 23.1 and 27.0 ml/100 gm/min at baseline to 4.0 and 2.5 ml/100 gm/min, respectively. The addition of CSF drainage improved GMBF during aortic cross-clamping in the lower thoracic and lumbar cord to 11.3 (p less than 0.05) and 15.1 ml/100 gm/min (p less than 0.03), respectively. After removal of the aortic cross-clamp, median blood flow more than tripled from baseline blood flow in group II, whereas CSF drainage prevented significant reperfusion hyperemia. Both low GMBF during cross-clamping and reperfusion hyperemia were associated with a worse neurologic outcome. In group II, no dog was neurologically normal, and more than 60% of the dogs had spastic paraplegia. In contrast, almost 60% of dogs in group III were normal, and none had spastic paraplegia (p less than 0.001). We conclude that CSF drainage in dogs during thoracic aortic occlusion maintained spinal cord perfusion above critical levels, diminished reperfusion hyperemia, and improved neurologic outcome.",

    "abstract": "We have used clamping of the aorta above the celiac axis (SC) in 30 of 431 elective resections of infrainguinal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) during the past five years as an alternative to a difficult aortic cuff dissection. The results of SC clamping in these 30 patients are compared with the results of 379 routine aneurysm resections with infrarenal (IR) clamping and 22 additional aneurysm resections where the clamp was placed immediately above the renal arteries. These difficult cuff dissections occurred in 12 patients with inflammatory AAA, in 11 patients with juxtarenal AAA, and in seven patients with recurrent or noninfected false AAA of the proximal cuff. Patients with ruptured or suprarenal aneurysms and those undergoing combined operation for a visceral ischemic syndrome and an aneurysm were excluded from this study. Patients with SC clamping had similar operative mortality rates, comparable renal function, and frequency of cardiac events as patients with IR clamping. Blood loss was slightly higher in the SC group (p = 0.07) and serum aspartate amino transferase (AST) levels were three times higher than in the IR group; however, this was of no clinical significance. In contrast, those 22 patients whose aortas were clamped immediately above the renal arteries (AR) had higher perioperative mortality rates (2% IR, 3% SC vs 32% AR) and a higher incidence of kidney failure requiring dialysis (1% IR, 3% SC vs 23% AR). The mean values of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were also significantly higher in the AR group when compared with both the IR and the SC groups (IR: 25 and 1.5 mg/dl, respectively; SC: 27 and 1.8 mg/dl; AR: 41 and 3.5 mg/dl). The single most important risk factor accounting for the differences between clamping above the celiac artery and clamping above the renal arteries was the presence of atherosclerotic debris in the nonaneurysmal, juxtarenal aortic segment. Clamping the aorta with juxtarenal atherosclerosis caused either atheroembolization to kidneys, legs, and intestine or injury to the aorta, renal arteries, or both; it was the cause of morbidity in all five cases of kidney failure requiring dialysis and accounted for all seven of the deaths in the AR group. SC clamping does not add risk to the patient undergoing resection of an infrarenal AAA and is the preferred method of achieving proximal control of the infrarenal aorta when a a hazardous cuff dissection is likely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Compression of the contralateral patent common carotid artery resulted in the ophthalmic systolic pressure/brachial systolic pressure ratio dropping from 0.67 +/- 0.012 to 0.29 +/- 0.017 (p less than 0.001) on the patient side and from 0.58 +/- 0.013 to 0.48 +/- 0.018 (p less than 0.001). Twenty-six of 53 patients (49%) developed ischemic symptoms in response to compression of the remaining patent ICA system. In contrast, only 8 of 122 patients (6.5%) without ICA occlusion developed any symptoms of cerebral dysfunction (p less than 0.001). This study suggests embolic events rather than flow reduction may be of greater importance in the production of new symptoms and that contralateral flow is critical to normal cerebral function in half the population with ICA occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Saphenous vein is the optimal conduit for infrainguinal vascular reconstruction. In instances in which this vein is unavailable or of \"poor quality,\" reliance has been placed on a variety of prosthetic materials for bypass grafting. However, long-term patency with these prosthetic grafts has been disappointing. In January 1985 we instituted a policy of using exclusively autogenous tissue for infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. During the ensuing 3-year period, 203 patients underwent 266 arterial operations below the inguinal ligament, with a prosthetic graft used in only 11 instances (4%). No patient was denied surgery for limb salvage because of a lack of available autogenous vein. Thirty-three percent of procedures were performed for failure of prior revascularization and 73% for limb salvage. The 3-year cumulative primary patency rate for all autogenous procedures was 72%. Procedures were divided into those that used greater saphenous vein (patency 77%) vs autogenous alternatives such as bypass with arm vein or lesser saphenous vein, vein patch angioplasty, and endarterectomy (patency 64%). The operative mortality rate was 1.4% and the 3-year limb salvage rate was 89%. Autogenous infrainguinal reconstruction can be performed in almost every instance with acceptable results, suggesting that the need for prosthetic bypass grafts in the lower extremity is less than has been previously reported.",

    "abstract": "Invoking unacceptable operative risks, many institutions have adopted a conservative policy toward carotid stenosis in patients who require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We have continued to apply simultaneous carotid endarterectomy/coronary artery bypass grafting (CEA/CABG) in selected patients, and in order to place operative risk in perspective, our experience with CEA/CABG was reviewed and contrasted with both CEA and CABG performed as isolated procedures. Seventy-one CEA/CABG were performed from 1978 to 1987, with the bulk of the experience (51/71) accumulated over the past 5 years. CEA/CABG was applied when the carotid lesion was severe (greater than or equal to 75% diameter stenosis). Clinical characteristics of patients with CEA/CABG (e.g., presence of unstable angina, left main coronary artery disease, and impairment of ventricular function) suggested these patients were at higher risk for complications when compared to patients with CABG alone. Yet, other factors influencing stroke risk during cardiopulmonary bypass (patient age, duration of CPB time) were similar between patients with CEA/CABG and patients with only CABG. Most complications in patients with CEA/CABG occurred in the early years of the study. Considering the recent (1983-87) patient cohorts of CEA/CABG and isolated CABG, respectively, there was no significant difference in either operative mortality (2.0% as compared to 2.2%) or perioperative stroke (2.0% as compared to 0.6%). Whereas precise patient selection criteria remain undefined, these findings verify the safety of the combined CEA/CABG approach for most patients who require treatment of both lesions.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound scanning has been used to assess mesenteric blood flow in normal and disease states. To investigate this technique we studied nine normal volunteers at rest and under conditions known to modify intestinal blood flow. After a baseline mesenteric duplex scan, each subject was given one of three treatments in random order: (1) test meal (710 kcal), (2) intravenous glucagon (40 micrograms/min), or (3) intravenous vasopressin (0.2 units/min). Peak systolic and diastolic velocities and vessel diameters were measured at intervals after treatment in the celiac and the superior mesenteric arteries (SMAs) and the right common carotid artery. Resting velocities did not differ among the groups. Peak systolic velocity increased significantly in both celiac and SMAs after the meal, with maximal changes in the celiac artery preceding those in the SMA in most subjects. Early diastolic flow reversal in the SMA was consistently lost after the meal (eight of nine subjects). Velocity changes after glucagon closely paralleled those after the meal. Vasopressin produced significant decreases in peak systolic velocity in both visceral vessels. No changes in vessel diameter were noted after any treatment. Coefficient of variation for repeated measures of peak velocities was 19% in the celiac and 12% to 16% in the SMA and the common carotid. The coefficient of variation for repeated measurements of arterial diameter was 6% to 8% in the SMA and 11% in the celiac artery. Clinically relevant changes in mesenteric hemodynamics can be reproducibly detected and quantitated by means of current duplex ultrasound technology. The similarities between the visceral arterial responses to a meal and glucagon are of interest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "One hundred ninety-five patients have been evaluated for possible laser recanalization (LR). Current laser delivery systems are most appropriate for the treatment of superficial femoral, popliteal, or isolated common iliac artery occlusions, and therefore one half (110) of the patients were initially excluded because of inappropriate disease location. An additional 39 patients were excluded because they showed minimal symptoms or the procedure would have been excessively risky for them. The remaining 46 patients underwent LR for total arterial occlusions, with relief of symptoms and increased ankle brachial indexes in 22 (48%). Of the four patients who could not be surgically reconstructed because of tibial artery occlusion, none was successfully treated. Only one patient required emergency reconstruction for ischemia after LR failure, and no procedures were required for treatment of perforation or bleeding. Successful LR was most likely when isolated lesions less than 15 cm in length, in the common iliac, middle or distal superficial femoral, and above-knee popliteal arteries were treated. Of the 22 patients for whom LR was successful, 11 would have been candidates for standard surgical therapy, six would have been excluded from such therapy by medical or surgical risks, and five had symptoms usually considered too mild to be offered surgery. Thus, at present the impact of LR on the treatment of patients with peripheral vascular disease appears limited.",

    "abstract": "A prospective, randomized comparison of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with surgery in the treatment of occlusive disease of the iliac, superficial femoral, or popliteal arteries began in 1983. Radiologists and vascular surgeons independently assessed index lesions on arteriograms to decide whether their respective treatments were appropriate. Of 263 male patients randomized, 255 received vascular intervention (surgery, 126 patients; PTA, 129 patients). The groups were comparable when stratified for systemic risk factors and anatomic distribution of disease. Because eligibility criteria required that all lesions randomized for treatment be suitable for PTA, the severity of disease was less than that of the general population having vascular disease. Claudication was the principal indication for intervention. The immediate failure rate for PTA was 15.5% (20 of 129 patients). Surgery was performed with one in-hospital death (0.8%) and 17 complications (13.5%). There were two late deaths ascribable to surgical complications and none to PTA. At 4.5 years, 50 deaths (20%) (28 from surgery; 22 with PTA) and 24 major amputations of legs included in the study (13 with surgery; 11 with PTA) have occurred. The baseline ankle-brachial indexes (ABIs) of 0.51 +/- 0.02, respectively, after treatment and was not different between the groups through 36 months (surgery, 0.28 +/- 0.04; PTA, 0.30 +/- 0.05).

    "abstract": "Sixteen patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis were reviewed retrospectively during a period from 1983 to 1987. Twelve patients had progressive abdominal pain, three had gastrointestinal bleeding, and one had general malaise. Seven of these 16 patients had previous deep-vein thrombosis. After negative routine gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary evaluation, 11 patients underwent an infusion computerized tomographic scan. Of these, 10 had superior mesenteric vein thrombosis; three of these 10 patients had portal vein thrombosis. Selective arteriography was done in two patients because of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a diagnosis of mesenteric vein thrombosis was made on the venous phase of the examination. The remaining four patients developed acute abdominal symptoms requiring surgical exploration, at which time mesenteric venous thrombosis was discovered. An identifiable coagulopathy was detected in nine patients (protein C deficiency in six, protein S deficiency in two, and factor IX deficiency treated with factor IX concentrate in one). No case of congenital antithrombin-III deficiency was identified. Six of these nine patients had a past history of deep venous thrombosis. Of five patients who underwent surgical exploration, all required bowel resection. In follow-up, two patients died of intestinal necrosis and a third died of associated pancreatic cancer. Thirteen patients were discharged from the hospital. Treatment of coagulopathy was by heparin in three patients and sodium warfarin (Coumadin) in four patients. Long-term anticoagulation was not instituted because of gastrointestinal bleeding in three and cirrhosis in three patients. Mesenteric venous thrombosis can occur without gangrenous bowel. Diagnosis should be suspected when acute abdominal symptoms develop in patients with prior thrombotic episodes and a coagulopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Between 1983 and 1986, 23 athletes were evaluated for arm and hand complaints. Eleven players had symptoms of thoracic outlet compression. Severe arm fatigue (eight patients) and finger ischemia (three patients) were the presenting symptoms. In the remaining 12 athletes, symptoms of hand ischemia were predominant. Noninvasive testing with Doppler ultrasonography and duplex scanning (positional testing and finger systolic pressure recording) and cold immersion were used to aid in diagnosis. In the 11 athletes with thoracic outlet compression, arteriography confirmed the finding with compression of the subclavian artery in five, the axillary artery in one, both subclavian and axillary arteries in two, posterior humeral circumflex artery in one, and subclavian aneurysm in two. Compression of the suprascapular artery was identified in four, the subscapular artery in two, and the posterior humeral circumflex artery in one. Thrombosis of a first baseman's ulnar artery and occlusion of the palmar arch in a frisbee player were documented by arteriography. Decompression of the thoracic outlet consisted of anterior scalenectomy in five, pectoralis minor muscle division in one, and resection of both muscles in two. Removal of cervical rib with interposed vein graft was performed in the two players with arterial aneurysm. Hand ischemia in the remaining athletes was treated conservatively with Dextran-heparin infusion for acute ischemia. Repeat noninvasive study of all players demonstrated absence of compression in their playing position, and all have resumed their playing careers. Hand ischemia in athletes can be evaluated noninvasively and treated conservatively. Resection of hypertrophied muscles to decompress the thoracic outlet together with release of branch artery compression in selected athletes promotes perfusion to arm and shoulder muscles and helps to avoid the catastrophic complication of repetitive trauma leading to sudden arterial thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Specific hemodynamic factors have been shown to be associated with atherosclerotic plaque localization at the human carotid bifurcation. Flow field characteristics may also determine plaque distribution in the abdominal aorta. We therefore characterized flow patterns in a glass model abdominal aorta that included its major branches under conditions of steady flow. Outflow resistances of the celiac, superior mesenteric, renal, inferior mesenteric, and iliac arteries were varied to produce flow distributions consistent with rest, the postprandial state, and vigorous lower limb exercise. Flow patterns were visualized with three colors of dye injected simultaneously through capillary tubes at selected locations and recorded as still photographs and by cinephotography on videotapes. Under resting conditions a large region of flow separation and stagnation occurred at the posterior wall of the aorta directly opposite the orifices of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Similar separation regions were observed during the simulated postprandial state but diminished markedly when distal outflow was increased to levels consistent with exercise. In the highly susceptible infrarenal aortic segment, beginning about 2 cm below the renal artery orifices, multiple secondary flow patterns with three to four counterrotating vortex formations were observed under both resting and postprandial conditions but disappeared in the exercise state. Secondary flow patterns were not noted in the suprarenal abdominal aorta, which is usually relatively spared. Such features have been related to plaque localization elsewhere, and the disappearance of these patterns with increased flow velocity during exercise is consistent with the previously noted protective effect of unidirectional laminar high-flow states. The beneficial effects of physical fitness programs may be related in part to these hemodynamic modifications.",

    "abstract": "Superoxide dismutase (SOD), barbiturates, and hypothermic crystalloid were evaluated for their effectiveness in minimizing ischemic damage to the spinal cord at 40 minutes of aortic occlusion. Forty-two dogs underwent proximal and distal thoracic aortic occlusion for 40 minutes with infusion of test agents into the occluded segment. The dogs were divided into six groups. Group 1 (n = 6) served as control. Group 2 (n = 6) received hypothermic crystalloid. Group 3 (n = 6) animals received thiopental. Group 4 (n = 7) received SOD. Group 5 (n = 9) received hypothermic crystalloid and thiopental. Group 6 (n = 8) received hypothermic crystalloid, thiopental and SOD. The animals were observed for neurologic deficit for 72 hours. In group 1, six of six dogs showed complete paralysis. Five of six dogs from group 2, five of six dogs from group 3, and five of seven dogs from group 4 showed complete paraplegia. The remaining dogs in these groups showed varying degrees of recovery. Four of nine dogs in group 5 had complete paraplegia, three dogs showed varying degrees of recovery, and two dogs had no neurologic deficit. In group 6, one dog had complete paraplegia, three had partial recovery, and four had no neurologic deficit. Group 6 was the only group that showed significantly less late neurologic impairment than the control group. We concluded that although cold perfusion, barbiturates, and SOD are not protective when used alone, they are effective when all are used in combination. The combination of cold perfusion, barbiturates, and SOD significantly decreases neurologic deficit after 40 minutes of aortic occlusion.",

    "abstract": "In vivo seeding of vascular grafts in dogs has resulted in the formation of a confluent luminal monolayer and increased patency. Results of similar trials in humans have been mixed. Interspecies variation of the harvest, attachment, and growth of vascular endothelium might explain these apparent differences. Endothelial cells were harvested by standard enzymatic techniques from bovine aorta (n = 7), canine external jugular vein (n = 9), and human saphenous vein (n = 8). Growth curves were generated by means of a replicate microwell technique and then compared with the following observations: Harvest of endothelium from human saphenous vein provides a lower yield of viable endothelial cells. When compared to bovine or canine cells, the lag phase of the growth curve of human cells is prolonged and the doubling time in the growth phase is increased. These results suggest that in humans there are fewer available cells, and conditions for endothelial cell growth may be more stringent than for other species. It may be necessary to develop alternative methods of seeding before success in humans can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Many patients who suffer a massive pulmonary embolus die despite emergent therapy. In these desperately ill patients an aggressive, combined method of management was initiated to improve their chances and quality of survival. During a 5-year period 10 patients were treated with (1) low-dose topical, intrapulmonary thrombolytic therapy to dissolve thrombus, (streptokinase or urokinase); (2) anticoagulation to prevent thrombus propagation (heparin); and (3) the simultaneous insertion of a Greenfield filter to prevent the early, recurrent, and therefore potentially fatal pulmonary embolus--\"triple-armed therapy.\" Thrombolytic therapy was administered through a Swan-Ganz catheter wedged against the pulmonary embolus. During the same interval 10 other patients also sustained massive pulmonary emboli but were treated only with systemic heparin. Serial pulmonary arteriography was performed daily. The patients treated by triple-armed therapy responded favorably with a rapid (less than 6 hours), significant improvement in PaO2, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary vascular resistance, and blood pressure, compared with patients treated with continuous heparin alone. Nine patients in the triple-armed therapy group survived whereas only six in the heparin group survived. Two additional patients were treated by triple-armed therapy and had thrombolysis with triple-armed therapy with tissue plasminogen activator; these patients demonstrated the most rapid improvement in cardiorespiratory dynamics and arteriographic clearance of emboli. This management protocol shows promise for patients who sustain a massive pulmonary embolus, because it reduces the morbidity associated with pulmonary embolectomy while avoiding the hazards associated with systemic thrombolytic therapy.",

    "abstract": "The optimal surgical management of combined aortic and renal atherosclerosis has not been defined. A modified technique of renal endarterectomy performed through the transected aorta before anastomosis of the aortic prosthesis is presented. The surgical course and early follow-up results of the first 44 consecutive patients treated by this technique are reported. Twenty-three patients (25%) had symptomatic coronary artery disease, 36 patients (82%) had arterial hypertension, and 28 patients (64%) had elevated serum creatinine levels (mean 2.10 mg/dl). Primary indications for operation related to aortic disease in 39 patients (89%) and to poorly controlled hypertension in five patients (11%). Seventy-five renal arteries were revascularized; 11% of these arteries were occluded. Revascularizations were bilateral in 27 patients (61%), involved a solitary kidney in three patients (6%), and were unilateral in 14 patients (32%). Aortobifemoral bypass grafting was performed in 16 patients (36%), aortoiliac bypass was performed in 15 patients (34%), and infrarenal aortic replacement was performed in 11 patients (25%). Postoperative complications developed in 14 patients (32%). There were two postoperative deaths (4%). Nineteen patients had transient increases in serum creatinine levels greater than 0.5 mg/dl. Two patients required postoperative dialysis, neither related to failure of their renal revascularization. There were five late deaths, all as a result of myocardial infarction. Renal function improved in four patients and remained stable in 22 patients. Blood pressure was improved in 64% of patients previously hypertensive. These preliminary results indicate that renal endarterectomy through the transected aorta along with aortic reconstruction is a safe, efficient, and effective means of treating these complex lesions.",

    "abstract": "The management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains controversial. From December 1983 to December 1987, 188 symptom-free patients were found to have severe (greater than 75%) stenosis by duplex imaging (performed as screening examination). Patients with non-hemispheric symptoms or contralateral symptomatic lesions (within 7 years) were excluded from the study. Follow-up data were available for 141 patients (range 3 to 36 months; mean 21 months). Sixty-two patients received nonoperative therapy. The remaining 79 patients underwent 100 carotid endarterectomies (CAE) (21 staged bilateral repairs and 58 unilateral repairs). There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, or risk factors (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, or smoking) or in the incidence of bilateral disease. Significant differences were found in the incidence of ischemic attacks (0 vs 21%; p less than 0.001) and stroke (2.5% vs 18%; p less than 0.01) in the operative vs nonoperative group. None of the 11 strokes in the nonoperative group were preceded by neurologic events. The operative group had an overall stroke rate of 2.5% (2/79), a perioperative mortality rate of 1.3% (1/79), and a restenosis (greater than 50%) rate of 3.8% (3/79). Thus favorable results can be achieved with prophylactic CAE. These data support the use of prophylactic CAE in any patient with greater than 75% stenosis identified by duplex image, regardless of sex, age, risk factors, or bilateral disease.",

    "abstract": "The cause and mechanism of post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension remains unknown. To determine the influence of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin system, we measured cranial and peripheral plasma levels of catecholamine and renin in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Baseline samples were drawn just before carotid clamping (sample I) and compared with study samples drawn immediately after clamp release (sample II), 2 to 6 hours after surgery (sample III), and then 18 to 24 hours after surgery (sample IV). The patients with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension had an associated increase of cranial and peripheral norepinephrine levels in the postoperative hypertensive period whereas the patients without post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension did not. This association was most pronounced and statistically significant in cranial samples II (p = 0.032) and III (p = 0.005). Epinephrine and dopamine values did not correlate with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension. Renin values were higher in cranial than in peripheral samples at time period 2 (p = 0.011), suggestive of a central nervous system Goldblatt phenomenon. However, the renin values did not correlate with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension. We conclude that post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension is associated with elevated cranial norepinephrine levels, suggestive of a central nervous system sympathomimetic mechanism. Optimal prevention and treatment of this brief but frequently occurring hypertension should include a central-acting sympatholytic agent.",

    "abstract": "Protamine is used routinely at our institution during arterial surgery to reverse the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Adverse fatal reactions to protamine are generally believed to be rare. However, major anaphylactoid reactions occurred in 11 of the last 1150 patients receiving this drug at our institution. Nine of these reactions occurred in 325 insulin-dependent diabetic patients (incidence, 3%), whereas only two occurred in the 825 patients not receiving insulin (incidence, 0.2%) (p less than 0.001). Ten of these reactions occurred within 10 minutes of protamine administration (15 to 35 mg), whereas one reaction occurred immediately after administration of a 5 mg test dose of protamine. Systolic blood pressure fell below 60 mm Hg in all of the 11 patients, and three patients had to be resuscitated with closed-chest massage. Initial treatment with epinephrine and steroids was successful in seven cases. Four patients required further resuscitative measures, including closed-chest massage. However, one of the patients died as a result of ventricular fibrillation resistant to treatment. Ten of the 11 patients, including the patient who died, had significant preexisting cardiac disease; six of the surviving 10 patients (60%) had perioperative myocardial infarctions and three died. Thus the total mortality rate was 36% (4/11). These data support the implication that neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin produces an adverse reaction through immunologic presensitization of the patient. These data also show that, in the older vascular surgery population with a high incidence of significant cardiac disease, protamine reactions can be potentially lethal. Thus routine use of protamine should be avoided in diabetic patients receiving insulin.",

    "abstract": "We compared combined B-mode/Doppler (duplex ultrasonic scanning and venography in routine preoperative and postoperative screening for major proximal deep vein thrombosis in 78 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. Of 309 extremity examinations, duplex scanning had an overall sensitivity of 85.7% (12/14) and a specificity of 97.3% (287/295). The preoperative prevalence and postoperative incidence of major deep vein thrombosis were 2.5% and 14.1% of patients, respectively, despite intensive mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis. In addition, venography documented a preoperative prevalence and postoperative incidence of isolated calf deep vein thrombosis in 2.5% and 16.7% of patients, respectively. Whereas such disease extended proximally even in the absence of anticoagulation in only 18% of patients studied by serial duplex scans, calf deep vein thrombosis accounted for the only two instances of pulmonary embolism in this study. There were no deaths related to pulmonary embolism. This study suggests that duplex scanning is useful in screening for perioperative deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, which carries a significant risk of venous thromboembolism despite routine prophylaxis.",

    "abstract": "During a 4-year period, 136 patients undergoing 152 carotid endarterectomies consented to be randomized to primary or saphenous vein patch closure of the arteriotomy. At operation, before randomization, careful assessment of arterial dimensions and anatomy was made. Patients who had an internal carotid artery (ICA) diameter less than 5 mm, arteriotomy extending more than 3 cm beyond the origin of the ICA, or tortuous or kinked ICAs were not randomized; they received obligatory vein patch closure (necessary in 20% cases). All patients were followed up every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months thereafter with duplex scanning, ocular pneumoplethysmography, and neurologic assessment. The incidence of atherosclerotic risk factors was equal in the groups and all except one of the patients were male. Perioperative morbidity was not significantly different among those having primary closure (n = 60), saphenous vein patch closure (n = 62), and obligatory vein patch closure (n = 30). Operative time among patients having primary closure (122 +/- 4 minutes) was significantly less (p less than 0.001) than among those having saphenous vein patch closure (150 +/- 3 minutes). Three perioperative strokes were evenly distributed among the groups (2% for all procedures); no deaths and no acute postoperative occlusions occurred. Recurrent disease occurred in 12.9% of patients having saphenous vein patch closure compared with its occurrence in 1.7% of those having primary closure (p less than 0.05). However, most recurrences were moderate stenoses (25% to 50% diameter reduction), all were smooth-surfaced, and none required a second operation. All except one of the recurrences among those patients with saphenous vein patch closure were in the bulb and the origin of the ICA; two had evidence of regression. This finding suggested that thrombus layering in the dilated part of the saphenous vein patch reconstruction was the cause. This study demonstrates that in men with carotid arteries of predetermined minimal dimensions undergoing carotid endarterectomy routine saphenous vein patch closure does not produce superior results, is associated with a higher incidence of early recurrence, and increases operative time. In selected patients with anatomic risk factors for recurrent disease or acute postoperative occlusion, saphenous vein patch closure is appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports have suggested that cerebral angiography may not be necessary before carotid endarterectomy is performed in selected patients. To determine if arteriography provides additional information that might influence the decision to operate or the conduct of the operation, a retrospective review was performed of 100 consecutive patients undergoing cerebral angiography and carotid duplex scanning. Eighty of the 100 patients subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy for neurologic symptoms or asymptomatic stenosis greater than 80%. Among the 20 patients not operated on, three would have undergone unnecessary surgery for mistaken diagnoses had the arteriogram not been obtained. Two other patients in this group of 20 would have had carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis in the presence of an equally stenotic tandem lesion. Among the 80 patients operated on, an additional three had the operative procedure altered because arteriographic studies revealed pathologic findings outside the area of duplex scan examination. Thus the use of arteriography altered the management of eight (8%) patients in this group of 100.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms of the abdominal aorta occur with atherosclerosis or connective tissue disorders. Changes of three components of aortic media, smooth muscle cells, elastin, and collagen, which could contribute to medial weakening, are discussed. Smooth muscle cells cultured from the aging abdominal aorta (normal, atherosclerotic, or aneurysmal) have limited replicative potential at five to six cell doublings, whereas cells from aneurysmal thoracic aorta undergo more than 20 cell doublings in culture. The elastin content is much reduced in aneurysms and this is associated with an increase in elastase activity of medial homogenates to 17.8 U/ng of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) compared with 8.3 and 4.4 U/ng of DNA in atherosclerotic and normal aorta, respectively. An elastinolytic enzyme has been purified from aneurysmal aorta and appears to have different properties from human leukocyte elastase. Ruptured aneurysms are associated with an increased total collagenase activity but the increase could be stimulated by, or result from, an influx of inflammatory cells and does not necessarily have a causal significance. In patients with a family history of aneurysm there appears to be a decreased content of type III collagen in aortic media: 24% +/- 4% compared with 32% +/- 5% in most aneurysms. Familial aneurysms are most common in women, and preliminary results suggest that a polymorphic variant of the type III collagen gene, defined by restriction enzyme digest, may be associated with aneurysmal disease in women. The genetic approach may define causal mechanisms predisposing patients to aneurysmal dilatation.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-related phenomena at the blood-surface interface of randomly placed knitted Dacron (n = 6) and polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) (n = 6) interposition aortic grafts were studied in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Luminal accumulation of platelets was assessed by infusing indium-111-oxine (400 microCi) labeled autologous platelets and imaging grafts at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Image analysis included an indium ratio technique (comparing aortic graft radioactivity to that of an iliac artery) and a red blood cell technetium subtraction technique (excluding blood pool radioactivity from graft radioactivity, with the heart or iliac artery serving as reference regions). Plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 were correlated with platelet accumulations on the aortic prostheses. Differences in graft radioactivity or platelet-release products were not evident 1 week after surgery. Three months after implantation, Dacron and ePTFE conduits exhibited 87% and 47% (p less than 0.05) more radioactivity with the indium ratio technique than the iliac artery. Similarly, increased Dacron compared with ePTFE graft radioactivity was noted using technetium subtraction techniques: 71% vs 30% with a heart reference and 26% vs 11% with an iliac artery reference, respectively. Increases in graft radioactivity correlated with increases in both plasma beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 at 3 months (r = 0.6 to 0.9; p less than 0.05 to 0.001 depending on the imaging technique used). At 6 months, differences did not persist. In fact, technetium subtraction techniques suggested less Dacron conduit reactivity. It is speculated that differences in platelet accumulation and activation associated with different graft substrates may prove clinically important.",

    "abstract": "To identify microanatomic and chemical features that may mark the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid lesions, we evaluated 62 carotid artery bifurcation plaques including 45 high-grade stenoses removed at endarterectomy and 17 nonstenotic plaques recovered at autopsy. Morphologic features were evaluated on multiple-interval histologic sections and were graded for the presence of hemorrhage, ulceration, thrombosis, lumen surface irregularity, and calcification. Plaque hemorrhage, recent and remote, was found in most of the specimens, and did not discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic stenotic plaques. High-grade carotid stenotic plaques were associated with a significantly higher incidence of ulceration (53%), thrombosis (49%), and lumen irregularity (78%) when compared to nonstenotic asymptomatic plaques (6%, 0%, and 17%, respectively; p less than 0.01). Although these features were more prominent in lesions that produced symptoms, they were present in 80% of the stenotic bifurcations, and did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic endarterectomy plaques. No significant differences were found between symptomatic and asymptomatic high-grade lesions with respect to collagen, DNA, total cholesterol, fibrinogen, lipase, elastase, or collagenase content. We conclude that intraplaque hemorrhage is commonly seen in carotid plaques even without severe stenosis, and it does not appear to be a dominant determinant of symptoms. Ulceration and surface thrombi that may lead to cerebral embolization are prominent features in markedly stenotic plaques even when symptoms are absent. The disruptive processes that underlie plaque instability appear to be closely associated with plaque size and stenosis rather than plaque composition.",

Twenty patients whose ages range from 23 to 50 years (mean 40.8 years) were identified prospectively who underwent lower extremity revascularization and evaluation of hypercoagulability. Fifteen patients were male (75%), 10 were black (50%), six had hypertension (30%), and four were diabetic (20%). All but two were cigarette smokers (90%). Seven aortoiliac procedures and 13 infrainguinal procedures were performed. Six patients had one or more abnormalities of regulatory proteins (protein S deficiency, four; protein C deficiency, three; presence of lupus-like anticoagulant, three; plasminogen deficiency, two). Eight of 17 patients in whom platelet aggregation profiles were obtained showed increased reactivity (47%). Only 4 of 17 patients (24%) were normal when tested for all parameters. Arterial or graft thrombosis developed in four of the 20 patients within 30 days after operation. Hypercoagulability was found in all four patients whose revascularizations failed. A high incidence of hypercoagulable states was found in patients under 51 years of age with lower limb ischemia requiring revascularization. Hypercoagulability may have contributed to early postoperative thrombosis of the vascular procedure.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of a protocol that monitored in situ saphenous vein bypass hemodynamics for low-flow states provided insight into the pathophysiologic characteristics and time course of graft failure. From 1981 to 1988, 250 in situ bypasses to popliteal (n = 83) or tibial (n = 167) arteries were performed in 231 patients. Indications for operation included critical limb ischemia in 232 cases (93%), popliteal aneurysm in 11 cases (4%), and disabling claudication in seven cases (3%). Arterial pressure measurements, continuous-wave Doppler spectral analysis, and duplex ultrasonography were used to assess patency, detect hemodynamic changes indicative of graft stenosis, and localize anatomic hemodynamic changes indicative of graft stenosis. Seventy grafts with correctable anatomic lesions (retained venous valves, graft stenosis, arteriovenous fistula, native vessel atherosclerosis) that decreased graft blood flow or ankle arterial pressure or both were identified. Correction of vein conduit or anastomotic lesions comprised 73 (77%) of the 95 revisions performed. Vein-patch angioplasty of a stenosis was the most common secondary operation performed. Graft revision was highest in the perioperative period (10% at 30 days), decreased to 7% per 6-month interval until 18 months, and was 3% per year thereafter. The primary patency rate of grafts not identified to have a correctable lesion was 86% at 4 years, a level similar to the secondary patency of 81% for grafts requiring one or multiple revisions. The surveillance protocol identified grafts with correctable lesions before thrombosis thereby permitting elective revision of patent grafts. Hemodynamic studies confirmed that a frequent mechanism of late failure of grafts was the development of a low-flow state produced by lesions not amenable to revision.",

    "abstract": "Because it is postulated that compartment syndrome developing secondary to an acute arterial occlusion may be due to reperfusion injury, oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in its genesis. To assess the possible beneficial effect of free radical scavengers in this setting, we used a previously established in vivo canine model of compartment syndrome to compare four groups: group I, no treatment; group II, prophylactic fasciotomy; group III, intravenous albumin conjugated superoxide dismutase (SOD); group IV, intravenous mannitol (hydroxyl radical scavenger). Both hind limbs were completely devascularized at the popliteal level except for an isolated pedicle to the anterior compartment. The right limb served as the nonischemic control, whereas the left underwent 8 hours of ischemia followed by reperfusion. Continuous monitoring of transfascial oxygen tension (tfPO2) demonstrated severe ischemia during occlusion (tfPO2 5.7 +/- 5.1 mm Hg) and restoration of blood flow with reperfusion (mean tfPO2 50 to 60 mm Hg). Measurements of compartment pressure were significantly higher after reperfusion in groups I, III, and IV when compared with those of group II (p less than 0.001, groups I and II; p less than 0.01, group IV). Extent of muscle necrosis assessed by technetium pyrophosphate scanning and expressed as a ratio of left to right legs was as follows: group I, 8.9 +/- 5.0; group II, 2.6 +/- 0.5; group III, 2.8 +/- 0.8; group IV, 1.8 +/- 0.6. Muscle contraction studies 16 hours after reperfusion indicated abnormal findings in all but group II. In conclusion, administration of free radical scavengers did not preserve normal neuromuscular function despite a significant reduction in muscle damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In previous experiments vein graft wall thickening stopped when the ratio of lumen radius to wall thickness equaled that of a normal artery. This led us to postulate that wall stress, which this ratio determines, regulates wall structure. To test this hypothesis we studied the effect of decreasing lumen radius and acutely diminishing wall stress with a rigid, external support. Jugular vein grafts were interposed into the carotid artery of rabbits. The proximal half of the grafts was wrapped with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Twelve veins received a tight wrap (2.5 or 3 mm diameter) that decreased the graft diameter, and four received a loose wrap (5 mm diameter) that did not. These grafts were fixed by perfusion after 1 day, 11 days, or 12 weeks. Wall thickness was slightly less in all tight-wrap segments. Total cross-sectional wall area, smooth muscle cell volume, and matrix deposition were significantly reduced in tight-wrap segments. These differences were greatest at 11 days. The observation that narrowing and external support of these vein grafts causes reduction of wall area supports the hypothesis that increased wall stress might be an important stimulus for wall thickening.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-one patients with established localized infection of vascular bypass grafts were treated with aggressive debridement and rotational muscle flap coverage to control graft infection. There were six gram-positive, six gram-negative, four mixed, and three fungal graft infections. Graft material included Dacron, Gore-Tex (registered trademark of W. L. Gore Associates Inc., Elkton, Md.), Dacron and Gore-Tex in combination, and saphenous vein. Twenty of 21 patients had successful preservation of graft function, local wound healing, and control of infection. There were no amputations or deaths. The one failure was caused by incomplete debridement of an infected graft segment. Aggressive debridement and rotational muscle flap coverage is an effective means of treating locally infected vascular bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether a slime-producing strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis was capable of producing acute infection of a prosthetic vascular graft, 5 cm segments of knitted Dacron were implanted in the infrarenal aortic position of dogs in three groups of animals. These included a control group (no graft contamination), a contaminated group that received a graft soaked in an S. epidermidis solution (untreated group), and a contaminated group in which perioperative antibiotics (three doses of cefamandole, 100 mg/kg) were administered (prophylaxis group). In all the animals reexploration and graft removal were performed at 10 days, with replacement of the defect being achieved with a new uncontaminated graft. These animals underwent exploration a third time after an additional 10-day period. S. epidermidis was not grown from the control animals (n = 7) but was cultured in 44% of the prophylaxis group (n = 9) and 88% of the untreated group (n = 16) during at least one of the operative procedures (chi 2 = 15.859; p less than 0.001). The pathologic features of acute S. epidermidis infection were best seen in the untreated animals and included anastomotic disruption (56%), periaortic hematoma, and lymphadenopathy (94%). Microscopic examination of the aortic tissues revealed extensive infiltrates of leukocytes, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells with aortic necrosis. These features were less prominent in the prophylaxis animals. We conclude that S. epidermidis is capable of producing acute graft infection with perigraft inflammation and anastomotic disruption. The administration of perioperative antibiotics reduced but did not abolish these effects of bacterial contamination of prosthetic vascular grafts.",

    "abstract": "A 69-year-old man with paradoxical embolism suffered a cerebral embolism despite treatment with anticoagulants and placement of a Greenfield filter. The open architecture of the filter allows it to maintain caval patency better than other mechanical devices, but this design also permits passage of emboli up to 3 mm in diameter. Although such small emboli do not produce symptoms in the pulmonary circuit, they can be devastating in the cerebral circulation. For this reason, the Greenfield filter may be inadequate treatment for paradoxical embolism. Ligation of the inferior vena cava is proposed as an alternative that provides better protection against small emboli.",

    "abstract": "We present further evidence that adventitial cysts of the popliteal artery are ganglions, based on studies of a lesion found in a 51-year-old man. The cyst was located entirely within the adventitia, lacked a cellular lining, and did not communicate with either the arterial lumen or the synovial space. The contents were gel-like and composed of 1.64 gm of hyaluronic acid and 0.20 gm of protein per dl. This material did not possess boundary-lubricating ability in a test system that slides natural latex rubber against glass. The histologic appearance, chemical composition, and absence of lubricating ability more closely resemble the characteristics of ganglions. These findings suggest that the cyst was not synovial but rather ganglionic in origin.",

Graft material and location had no significant effect on the initial results. Urokinase was used in 43 cases with a 84% success rate, and streptokinase was used in 29 cases with a 48% success rate. After a follow-up period that ranged from 2 to 58 months, 27 grafts remained patent, with an average patency duration of 15 months (median 8 months). Overall graft patency at the end of 1 year was 60% applying life-table analysis. Factors that were evaluated to determine their effect on long-term patency included graft age and material, graft location, and the presence or absence of an underlying correctable lesion. The most significant factor in long-term patency was the presence of a lesion that was correctable by surgical revision or balloon angioplasty. In 25 grafts with underlying stenotic lesions, the 1-year patency was 86% after successful treatment. Twenty-five grafts without detectable lesions had 37% 1-year patency.",

It is also useful for distal reconstruction of branch renal arteries, renal artery embolectomy, and autotransplantation \"bench surgery.\" We have used this approach in 28 patients with no operative deaths and two reconstructive occlusions.",

Preliminary carotid endarterectomy (CE) was feasible before CAB in only 24 patients with stable cardiac disease (group I). Another 129 patients with unstable disease (group II) had unilateral, asymptomatic carotid lesions and were prospectively randomized to receive either combined operations (IIA; n = 71) or CAB followed by delayed CE (IIB; n = 58). The remaining 122 patients (group III) had symptomatic or bilateral carotid stenosis and were managed on a selective basis without randomization. The operative mortality rate ranged from 4.2% to 5.2%, and the early stroke rates were 4.2% in group I, 7.8% in group II, and 11% in group III. Postoperative strokes occurred after CAB in nine (4.7%) of the 193 patients protected by preliminary or simultaneous CE, compared with six (7.4%) of the 81 who received only delayed CE. Nevertheless, the composite stroke risk for \"reverse-staged\" procedures in group IIB (14%) exceeded that for combined operations (2.8%) in group IIA (p = 0.045). The stroke rate was 11% (7/61) when delayed CE was performed within 2 weeks after CAB compared with 2.2% (1/46) with longer staging intervals.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial-derived relaxing factor is an important modulator of vascular relaxation, and its production is very sensitive to endothelial injury. The abdominal aortas of five groups of rabbits were subjected to Fogarty balloon catheterization via the femoral artery. Some rabbits were killed immediately (time 0), and others were killed at weekly intervals. At time 0, isolated vascular rings sectioned from the abdominal aortas and suspended in tissue baths failed to exhibit any endothelial-derived relaxing factor dependent vascular relaxation. Vascular relaxation progressively returned but was not normal until 4 weeks after the initial injury. Morphologic changes studied by means of Evans blue dye and by scanning electron microscopy with silver staining corresponded well with these functional changes. At time 0, the delicate endothelium was completely denuded, but it progressively regenerated over the subsequent 4 weeks. This severe injury to the vascular endothelium and the resultant vascular dysfunction may result in an increased risk of early postoperative spasm and thrombosis after the use of a Fogarty balloon catheter.",

    "abstract": "Effective methods for performing abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy associated with congenital pelvic kidney are presented. The embryology and surgical anatomy of these lesions are reviewed. Ordinarily, successful aortic reconstruction can be performed with low risk to the pelvic kidney by use of readily available in situ cold perfusion. Two illustrative case reports applying this method are presented. The recently reported technique of double proximal clamping of the aorta was also employed in one case. This technique allows lumbar collaterals within the aneurysm to perfuse the kidney during construction of the proximal aortic anastomosis, thereby minimizing absolute renal ischemic time. Both in situ cold perfusion and double proximal clamping are effective methods for renal preservation that do not rely on complex extraanatomic techniques. A review of the literature with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of previously reported methods of renal preservation is presented.",

    "abstract": "Four patients with occlusive complications after percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty (PTA) have been treated from July 1, 1984, to March 14, 1988. During this interval such renal artery angioplasties were performed in 44 patients. Two resulted in complete main renal artery occlusion, one angioplasty resulted in occlusion of a stenotic renal artery bypass graft, and one renal PTA resulted in segmental branch renal artery narrowing, which was thought to represent a dissection. The latter segmental renal artery narrowing was treated expectantly with good long-term results. One of the main renal artery occlusions was treated by radiologic means by reentry and repeat transluminal dilation. The other two acute complete occlusions, one of an autogenous artery and the other of an aortorenal bypass graft, were treated by aortorenal or ileorenal bypass grafting, respectively. The overall incidence of main renal artery occlusion (including the bypass graft occlusion) after PTA requiring operative intervention was 4.5% (2/44). Revascularization was accomplished after 6 and 8 hours of renal ischemia time for the two surgical procedures. Despite this, the bypass grafts done emergently remain patent, and the involved kidneys appear to be functional. The incidence of main renal artery occlusion after PTA is not as low as would be apparent from a review of the literature. It is proposed that main renal artery occlusion after PTA can be treated successfully by surgical and interventional radiologic techniques because of the presence of protective renal collateral circulation whose formation was stimulated by the renal artery lesion that prompted PTA.",

    "abstract": "Platelet parameters were assessed in patients after implantation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, either nonseeded or seeded with autologous endothelial cells or reversed saphenous vein grafts, during the follow-up period of 1 year. The objective of this investigation was to compare the sensitivity of different noninvasive platelet parameters with the assessment of the result of endothelial cell seeding. Scanning electron microscopic investigation of circulating blood platelets showed a significantly higher incidence of activated platelets in patients with seeded or nonseeded PTFE grafts, compared with patients after reversed vein graft implantation. \"Shape-changed\" platelets, as well as membrane-perforated thrombocytes, were found exclusively in the circulating blood of patients after seeded or nonseeded PTFE graft implantation, indicative of platelet trauma by the artificial graft surface. Plasma levels of platelet factor IV and beta-thromboglobulin, as well as the uptake of indium-111-labeled platelets, failed to show statistically significant differences after 1 year of follow-up. The similar results for seeded and nonseeded grafts indicate the failure of endothelial cell seeding to induce the development of a nontraumatizing surface, comparable to that of saphenous vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that duplex ultrasound is an accurate method of diagnosing renal artery stenosis (93% accuracy compared with angiography in the diagnosis of less than 60% stenosis, 60% to 99% stenosis, or occlusion). With this method we have now serially observed 35 renal arteries with 60% to 99% renal artery stenosis in 27 patients. Nineteen stenotic renal arteries in 15 patients were observed without intervention. There was a significant decrease in kidney size (mean difference - 1.0 cm; p less than 0.01; mean follow-up 13 months) but all 19 renal arteries remained patent. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed in five patients (six renal arteries) for renovascular hypertension. Renal duplex scanning documented relief of renal artery stenosis in two patients whose hypertension improved after PTA and confirmed residual 60% to 99% renal artery stenosis in three patients whose hypertension did not improve after PTA (mean follow-up 6.5 months). Aortorenal bypass was performed for 10 stenotic renal arteries in seven patients. At a mean follow-up of 9 months duplex ultrasound documented eight patent and two occluded aortorenal bypass grafts. Duplex ultrasound is useful both for defining the natural history of untreated renal artery stenosis and assessing the results of renal artery angioplasty or bypass.",

    "abstract": "Surgical hospital payment issues and socioeconomic concerns are likely to attract more attention in the future, especially regarding access and the quality of surgical care. We analyzed all peripheral vascular surgical admissions (n = 1240) by age treated at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center from 1985 to 1987. Hospital cost and length of stay per patient increased with age, as did losses under diagnostic related group (DRG) prospective hospital payment. Hospital cost by hospital service showed considerable variation by age category; outliers, mortality, and the number of diagnoses and procedures generally rose with age. Use of hospital resources, such as emergency or surgical intensive care unit admission, or the need for blood or plasma products was high in general for patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. This study demonstrates a number of findings regarding the socioeconomic factors for hospitalized patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. Surgical health policy analysis of this specialty vis-a-vis current changes proposed to the federal medicare DRG system in the U.S. Congress and Health Care Financing Administration suggests a relatively greater impact on the specialty of peripheral vascular surgery demonstrated in this study by the use of higher resources of the same.",

    "abstract": "Some patients with severely ischemic lower limbs continued to have severe ischemic changes in the foot after revascularization procedures and appropriate four leg compartment fasciotomies. Rather than abandon efforts at limb salvage, we performed adjunctive fasciotomies of the ankle and foot in 11 of these patients. These included five cases of acute traumatic superficial femoral or popliteal artery occlusions (three penetrating injuries; two blunt injuries) requiring primary repair or interposition vein graft; three cases of penetrating injury to all infrapopliteal arteries requiring tibiotibial vein bypasses; two cases of iatrogenic thrombosis of the common femoral artery requiring thrombectomy and patch angioplasty; and one case of a traumatically amputated leg requiring replantation. All bypasses remained patent after the distal fasciotomies. Limb salvage and good functional results were achieved in 10 of the 11 patients from 4 to 28 months postoperatively. One patient required a below-knee amputation because of bleeding from an infected graft. Thus fasciotomy of the ankle and foot should be considered during acute revascularizations when a distal bypass occludes without obvious reasons, or when the foot remains ischemic or shows signs of compartment syndrome unrelieved by standard leg fasciotomy.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a systemic disorder and coronary artery disease is highly prevalent in patients treated for lower-extremity obstructive vascular disease. Myocardial ischemia and infarction represent the most frequent and most clinically important complications of surgical procedures for lower-extremity revascularization. Despite attempts in several areas, no practical, sensitive, and specific method for identifying patients at highest risk for myocardial events postoperatively has been found before now. This study reports observations on a consecutive series of 50 patients who underwent continuous perioperative electrocardiographic monitoring with a microprocessor-based electrocardiographic ischemia monitor. Thirty-eight percent of the patients were found to have episodes of ischemia; most of these episodes were painless and would not otherwise have been recognized. Ischemia was most prominent in the postoperative rather than the preoperative or intraoperative phases. Tachycardia was often associated with ischemia. Significantly more cardiac-related morbidity and deaths occurred in patients who were documented to have silent myocardial ischemia. In fact, no cardiac events occurred in the 31 patients without ischemia (p less than 0.02). This type of ischemia monitoring represents a potential method for segregating patients at high risk for cardiac-related morbidity and death during lower-extremity revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Twenty rabbits were divided into three groups: (1) cage controls, (2) machine controls, and (3) cigarette exposed. The cigarette-exposed group was exposed to two 2-R1 reference cigarettes a day for 6 weeks on a Walton-II (Process and Instruments Corp., Brooklyn, N.Y.) smoking machine. Rabbits in the machine control group were placed in the smoking machine for the same period of time without cigarettes. Cage control animals were not placed in the smoking machine. Aortic elastase was significantly higher in the cigarette-exposed group (21.11 +/- 6.15) compared to both the cage control group (3.11 +/- 1.11) and machine control group (14.66 +/- 4.69). Aortic elastase in the machine control group was significantly higher in smoke-exposed rabbits than in both cage control and machine control rabbits. These data indicate that cigarette smoking increases aortic elastase activity in rabbits. If these data were to be extrapolated to humans, then patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms who smoke may have an accelerated rate of aneurysm growth or earlier rupture or both.",

    "abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombosis is due to an immune-mediated activation of circulating platelets and has significant clinical implications for patients with vascular disease. The purpose of this article was (1) to define the biochemical mechanisms of heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) and (2) to determine the relationship between thromboxane A2 (TxA2) synthesis and platelet granule release. In two patients with confirmed HIPA, heparin (3 U/ml) induced extensive platelet aggregation (61.5%), release of 14C-serotonin (81.5% of releasable 14C-serotonin, a dense granule marker) and platelet factor 4 (63.7% of releasable platelet factor 4, an alpha granule marker) and generation of TxB2, a stable metabolite of TxA2 (100% relative to serum control). In one patient heparin did not induce release of n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminadase (N-AC, a lysosomal granule marker), and aspirin (4 mmol/L), which abolished TxA2 synthesis, prevented aggregation and granule release. In the second patient heparin did induce release of N-AC (39.7% of releasable N-AC) and aspirin, despite abolishing TxA2 synthesis, did not prevent aggregation or granule release. In contrast, by elevating intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, iloprost (0.01 mumol/L), a stable prostacyclin analogue, prevented heparin-induced aggregation, granule release, and TxB2 generation in both patients. Thus we show (1) HIPA can proceed independently of TxA2 synthesis; (2) heparin in certain patients can release lysosomal hydrolases, thus mimicking strong platelet agonists such as thrombin; and (3) iloprost but not aspirin prevents HIPA regardless of the biochemical pathways involved.",

    "abstract": "Between June 1983 and December 1987, 52 patients underwent resection of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm under simple aortic cross-clamping without the use of shunting or bypass techniques. The 30-day mortality rate was 11.5%; 4.8% for elective cases and 36.5% for patients operated on in emergency. Two patients (4%) had spinal cord injury. One patient had paraplegia, and the other had mild paraparesis but completely recovered. Both patients were operated on for ruptured aneurysms. Four patients (7.5%) had severe postoperative renal dysfunction that was strongly related to intraoperative hypotension. The cumulative proportional survival rate was 81% at 1 year and 66% at 2 years for the total group. 85% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years for the patients first seen with nonruptured aneurysms. Aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta can be safely resected without the use of shunting or bypass techniques. Surgery definitely improves the outcome for these patients who have a poor prognosis if left untreated.",

    "abstract": "Selective laser ablation of human atherosclerotic plaque is possible because endogenous carotenoid pigments found in atherosclerotic plaque confer a twofold preferential absorption of laser radiation at 450 to 500 nm. In this study, patients with carotid endarterectomy were pretreated with oral beta carotene to determine if the carotenoid content and therefore laser selectivity of plaque could be increased in vivo. Beta carotene-treated patients had a significant, nearly twofold increase in their plaque carotenoid concentration, which increased from 0.22 to 0.40 microgram beta carotene/mg cholesterol. These results suggest that selective ablation of atherosclerotic plaque may be enhanced by pretreating patients with doses of oral beta carotene for short periods of time.",

    "abstract": "Forearm Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistulas were chosen for the initial clinical evaluation of argon laser-assisted anastomosis of human vessels. Ten patients with chronic renal failure had side-to-side radial artery/cephalic vein fistulas fused by laser. Incisions 1.2 to 1.5 cm in length were made in adjacent segments of artery and vein and were aligned for application of laser energy by four 6-0 polypropylene sutures. The sutures divided each fistula into four segments that were 5.0 to 6.5 mm long. Each segment was sealed satisfactorily in 75 to 100 seconds by use of 0.5 W, 1130 to 1520 joule/cm2 argon laser energy fluence. Seven (17.5%) of 40 bonds required an additional 7-0 biodegradable suture to close small gaps that did not fuse adequately. Serial prospective follow-up studies of the patients by physical examination and duplex scanning for periods of 12 to 20 months (15.4 +/- 2.8, n = 7) postoperatively have shown uniformly patent, compliant anastomoses with no evidence of hematomas, false aneurysms, or luminal narrowing. Histologic examination of two patent fistulas that were excised during revision procedures at 4 and 5 months postoperatively showed healing of the entire circumference of the anastomosis similar to that noted in extensive preclinical canine studies. We conclude from these preliminary results that argon laser vascular tissue fusion is possible in humans when reliable primary sealing of vascular anastomoses is achieved, and that healing occurs without aneurysmal dilatation during follow-up of up to 20 months.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the perioperative outcomes and the immediate increases in size after patch closure, 140 carotid endarterectomies were randomized into one of three groups: direct no-patch closure, saphenous vein patch closure, and polytetrafluoroethylene patch closure. Seven patients (4.4%) experienced signs of cerebral ischemia in the immediate postoperative period. In three cases this was transient and reversible. In the other four reexploration was undertaken and carotid thrombosis was corrected by thrombectomy. The condition of one of these patients deteriorated to a permanent stroke, whereas the other patients made a complete recovery. Neurologic complications were more frequent in the no-patch group, but the differences between the groups were not significant. The incidence of perioperative internal carotid stenosis, aneurysmal dilatation, and other morphologic abnormalities was assessed in 131 intravenous digital subtraction angiograms taken before the patient was discharged from the hospital. Eight (17.0%) of the endarterectomies in the no-patch group were narrowed by 30% to 50% diameter stenosis, whereas none of the patched arteries had more than 30% stenosis. In contrast, dilatation of the common or internal carotid artery to more than twice the measured diameter was absent in non-patched arteries but was present in seven (17.0%) saphenous patch closures and four (9.23%) polytetrafluoroethylene patch closures. We conclude that patch closure after carotid endarterectomy is less likely to cause stenosis in the perioperative period. Poly-tetrafluoroethylene patches resist dilatation better than do saphenous vein patches and are less likely to become aneurysmal.",

The relationship of clinical trials to other forms of clinical studies is explored. The fundamentals of sound design, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials are detailed. Ethical issues, costs, and limitations of trials are explored. The article reviews the trends in program content of 749 abstracts presented at the joint vascular surgical meetings during the past 17 years, demonstrating a significant increase in reported clinical trials during the last half of this period. Finally, future trends in the use of clinical trials to \"validate\" medical practice are suggested in response to efforts to control rising health care costs. Physicians, including vascular surgeons, must become knowledgeable in the principles of clinical trials to interpret more effectively, apply, or even participate in such clinical research.",

    "abstract": "Patients with acutely injured spinal cords are thought to be at increased risk for thromboembolic disease and often have contraindications to anticoagulation therapy. From 1981 to 1986, 13 patients with quadriplegia at the New England Regional Model Spinal Cord Injury Center had caval interruption with a Greenfield filter. Twelve patients had deep venous thrombosis documented by venogram results and one had pulmonary embolism documented by arteriogram results. \"Quad cough\" chest physical therapy was required for mobilization of pulmonary secretions in nine patients. Follow-up abdominal x-ray results revealed significant abnormalities referrable to the filter in five patients having undergone \"quad cough\" therapy. Four patients had distal migration of the filter; three of the four had deformation of the filter. Laparotomy for bowel perforation was required in two of these patients. Quadriplegia requiring vigorous chest physical therapy (\"quad cough\") for pulmonary toilet may be a contraindication to caval interruption by Greenfield filter. Alternative techniques in the management of patients with quadriplegia and pulmonary compromise must be considered.",

    "abstract": "To determine the natural history of changes in plaque morphology and luminal diameter of atherosclerotic carotid arteries, we used duplex scanning to follow-up (1) the contralateral artery in 289 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy, with a mean follow-up 22 months and a range of 0 to 48 months and (2) the carotid arteries in 130 patients who had no surgical treatment and had been symptom free, with a mean follow-up period of 15 months and a range of 0 to 48 months. Plaques were graded as to the ratio of echolucency to echogenicity, with type 1 being most echolucent and type 4 being most echogenic. A normal-appearing artery was classified as type 5. Heterogeneous plaques (types 1 and 2) occurred significantly more (p less than 0.001) in symptomatic preoperative arteries than in asympatomatic arteries. Follow-up of the asymptomatic vessels showed that the majority of plaques either remained the same or became more echogenic (fibrous). Approximately one fourth of plaques in each group degenerated (more echolucent). Thirty-one patients (10.7%) developed new symptoms in the contralateral asymptomatic group, with 10 patients (3.5%) having strokes. Fourteen of 130 (10.8%) patients, or 5.4% of vessel territories at risk, in the primary asymptomatic group developed new symptoms, with only two strokes occurring. In the contralateral asymptomatic group those patients who initially had greater than 75% stenoses fared worse than those with primary asymptomatic disease with greater than 75% stenosis. Although the overall development of new symptoms is low in both populations, our data indicate that those patients with heterogeneous plaques or whose plaques have undergone change may be at risk for new symptoms. Longer follow-up studies are needed to define the role of plaque changes in the development of symptoms. For now we advocate a conservative \"wait and see\" approach to symptom-free patients with greater than 75% stenoses and calcified plaques. We suggest a more aggressive approach, recommending early surgical intervention, to those few patients with heterogeneous plaques.",

    "abstract": "Fifty patients who had carotid bifurcation endarterectomy as their sole surgical procedure underwent intraoperative completion angiography by means of portable intraarterial digital subtraction angiography. All had subsequent intravenous digital subtraction angiography or duplex scanning during early follow-up. After the endarterectomy site was closed and before the wound was closed, 6 to 8 ml of contrast was injected through a 21-gauge needle while fluoroscopy was performed with a conventional C-arm. The C-arm was coupled to a Quantel IDIS Mobile Digital Subtraction Angiogram Unit (Quantel Medical Products Group, Clemmons, N.C.) for image enhancement and immediate playback. There were no postoperative deaths or neurologic complications. Abnormal radiographic results led to reopening of endarterectomy sites in eight patients, which resulted in successful correction of the defects. There was a single asymptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery at 3 weeks in the patient with the only false-negative result on the completion study. Intraarterial digital subtraction angiography is a safe and useful technique for intraoperative quality control of carotid endarterectomy. It provides visual images that can be easily repeated in several projections, uses small volumes of contrast, and has no timing requirements for filming and injecting.",

    "abstract": "In this study an in vitro model that permits visualization of the flow velocity profile has been used to determine if duplex pulsed Doppler recordings made with a small sample volume in the center line of the vessel can determine the severity of a stenosis in the 38% to 75% range of cross-sectional area reduction. Because most Doppler instruments measure the maximum peak frequency and the extent of spectral broadening, observations in the flow model included changes in the center-line maximum velocity and the location and intensity of flow disturbances. The results showed that center-line measurements of maximum velocity (equivalent to peak Doppler frequency) were directly related to the severity of the stenosis as long as the recordings were made from within the throat to about 1.5 to 3 tube diameters downstream, depending on the shape of the stenosis. However, flow disturbances (equivalent to spectral broadening) did not always occur in the center line of the vessel. Stenoses greater than 50% area reduction produced turbulence across the entire vessel in the region 4.5 to 7.5 diameters downstream. The turbulent period started just before peak systole and extended to just less than half the pulse cycle. In the more proximal zone a forward flow jet was present in the central part of the vessel, and reverse flow was present in the outer region. The interfacial layer between these two regions is subjected to high shear rates that resulted in the formation of waves and vortices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Applications of laser energy for treatment of vascular disease have recently received much attention; metal-tipped laser probes are being investigated as a device for recanalization of occluded arteries, especially as an adjunct to balloon dilatation. Developments in instrumentation and techniques have reduced the incidence of complications, notably perforation, to an acceptable level. Initial data show that recanalization of iliac, femoral, and popliteal lesions can be accomplished in a majority of cases, with the chance of success being inversely proportional to the length of occlusion. Results in the tibial vessels are disappointing. Patency of the treated vessels at 12 months appears to be superior to that of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for similar lesions but inferior to that of surgical bypass for all occlusions greater than 3 cm in length.",

    "abstract": "This current study analyzed macrophage/biomaterial interactions as modulators of endothelial cell proliferation. Rabbit peritoneal macrophages were harvested and seeded (1 x 10(6) cells/ml) into culture flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and 10% platelet-poor, plasma-derived equine serum. Macrophages were identified by morphologic characteristics, nonspecific esterase, and Fc (immunoglobulin G) receptors on the cell membranes. Culture conditions were (1) no prosthetic material, (2) Dacron, or (3) Polyglactin 910 (PG910) (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, N.J.). Both prosthetic materials were finely shredded into the media. After 5 weeks in culture, PG910 inclusions were seen within macrophage cytoplasm. No intracytoplasmic Dacron was observed. Conditioned media from all three groups were collected weekly from week 5 to week 10, centrifuged, filtered, and added in serial dilutions to cultured quiescent murine capillary lung endothelial cells. Quiescence was achieved by serum deprivation and verified by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Sixteen hours after addition of conditioned media, [3H]thymidine was measured in and expressed as percent increase above quiescent levels. Mitogenic activity in the PG910 group progressively increased from weeks 6 to 10. At week 10, the PG910 group (1:10 dilution) yielded a 620% increase in DNA synthesis. The Dacron group never varied from the control group (no prosthetic). The mean increases in [3H]thymidine incorporations over weeks 7 to 10 were PG910, 540% +/- 65%; Dacron, 323% +/- 65%, and control, 343% +/- 26% (PG910 vs Dacron, p less than or equal to 0.004). These studies suggest macrophage activation by bioresorbable prostheses, yielding growth factor release with subsequent enhanced endothelial cell proliferation.",

Cell counts and morphometric analyses were done immediately after 60 minutes of electronically controlled seeding of 3 x 10(4) EC/cm2, as well as after 3 hours of subsequent incubation. Cell adherence and cell spreading were distinctly superior on two surface-covering substrates: fibronectin-treated type I/III collagen and fibrinolytically inhibited fibrin glue. Uncovered, purely fibronectin- or laminin-coated PTFE or type IV collagen treated with the specifically binding glycoprotein laminin showed a far lower EC attachment rate and less pronounced cell spreading. It appears that not only a high surface content of fibronectin but also a smooth PTFE-covering matrix are prerequisites for optimal primary adherence and cell spreading. Because fibrin glue might be fibrinolytically degraded despite its plasmin-inhibiting epsilon-amino-caproic acid compound, type I/III collagen plus fibronectin could provide an optimal precoating substrate for EC lining of PTFE grafts.",

    "abstract": "Antithrombin (AT III), a major circulating anticoagulant, may be influenced by ischemia-induced changes in microvascular integrity and contribute to localized hypercoagulability. In a nonheparinized intact canine hindlimb model we determined AT III activity by chromogenic substrate assay (S-2238); coagulation changes with fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and prothrombin time (PT); and transvascular exchange by lymph-to-plasma total protein concentration ratio. Femoral venous plasma and lymph samples were assayed during 1 hour of steady state (C), 6 or 8 hours of aortoiliac occlusion (I), and 1 or 3 hours of reperfusion (R). Four groups were studied: GI, sham operated (n = 5); GII, moderate ischemia (n = 7), arterial pressure 30% to 45% C, GIII, 6 hours of severe ischemia (n = 7), arterial pressure 5% to 20% C; and GIV, 8 hours of severe ischemia (n = 5), arterial pressure 5% to 20% C. All parameters varied near baseline in the control group and the group with moderate ischemia. Fibrinogen decreased after 3 hours of ischemia in GIII from 218 +/- 38 to 175 +/- 46 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM) and in GIV from 254 +/- 39 to 201 +/- 44 mg/dl (p less than 0.005) as aPTT and PT increased. All parameters returned to baseline on R in GIII only. Plasma AT III decreased in GIV from 89% +/- 4.6% to 53.6% +/- 16.2% (p less than 0.005) after 3 hours and remained low during late I and R.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Penetrating ulcer of the thoracic aorta is defined as an atherosclerotic lesion of the descending thoracic aorta with ulceration that penetrates the internal elastic lamina, allowing hematoma formation in the media. There is controversy whether this lesion differs from classic acute type III aortic dissection, based on its location, radiographic findings, natural history, and recommended therapeutic approach. Of 47 patients with a diagnosis of aortic dissection seen at our hospital during a 2-year period, five patients had clinical and radiographic findings of penetrating ulcer. Each of the five patients had characteristic computerized tomographic (CT) findings and two patients had angiographic confirmation. In all patients CT showed subintimal hemorrhage, aortic wall enhancement, absence of a double lumen, and contrast extravasation through the ulceration. In both patients who underwent angiography, ulceration, subintimal hematoma, and absence of a false lumen were demonstrated. The clinical presentation in four patients simulated acute aortic dissection or expanding thoracic aneurysm. The other patient, who was normotensive, did not have symptoms referable to the thoracic aorta but was studied because of an abnormal chest x-ray film. None of these five patients required surgical intervention. All five patients were alive and free of symptoms at 6 months, 8 months, 14 months (two patients), and 30 months after the original diagnosis. Follow-up CT scans in four patients showed resolution of subintimal hematoma and some dilatation of the lumen but no progression to rupture or aneurysm. Other authors stress the importance of differentiating symptomatic penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers from acute type III aortic dissection because of the higher incidence of rupture of penetrating ulcers and therefore recommend early surgical intervention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Among the considerations affecting the therapeutic approach to patients with atherosclerosis of the lower extremities is their associated risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and limb loss. To investigate the relationship of these events to the severity of peripheral vascular disease we undertook a 6-year review of 247 consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity noninvasive vascular assessment. There were 130 men and 117 women with a mean age of 65 +/- 15 years. Patients were categorized into four groups according to their ankle-brachial pressure indexes at their first visit. Ninety-seven patients had normal indexes (greater than or equal to 0.92), 86 had indexes of 0.50 to 0.91, 39 had indexes of 0.31 to 0.49, and 25 had indexes within the ischemic range, less than or equal to 0.30. At 6 years 64% of the patients with ischemic indexes were dead. This incidence was significantly higher than that of any other patient category (p less than 0.01). Diabetes also had a significantly adverse effect on survival. The incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction was similar for all disease groups. Thirteen percent and 32% of patients with indexes of 0.31 to 0.49 and less than or equal to 0.30, respectively, underwent limb amputation. We conclude that patients with evidence of mild to moderate peripheral vascular disease have a survival rate and risk of vascular-related disorders similar to those of patients of similar age with little evidence of disease, whereas an ankle-brachial pressure index less than or equal to 0.30 is associated with a malignant prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoscintigraphy (LS), performed with technetium 99m-labeled antimony trisulfide colloid (Cadema Medical Products, Inc., Middletown, N.Y.), was used as a noninvasive diagnostic examination to evaluate the lymphatic circulation in 190 extremities of 115 patients. Forty-six patients had primary lymphedema, 48 had secondary lymphedema, and 21 patients had other causes of limb swelling. To determine the value of LS in surgical decision making, preoperative and postoperative LS of 16 patients who underwent surgical repair of the lymphatic abnormality were studied separately. Semiquantitative evaluation of the lymphatic drainage and visual interpretation of the image patterns were reliable to differentiate lymphedema from edemas of other origin (sensitivity: 92%, specificity: 100%). Although certain image patterns were characteristic of either primary or secondary lymphedema, LS could not consistently differentiate between the two types. Episodes of cellulitis in lymphedema clearly delayed lymph transport. LS was helpful in patient selection and follow-up after lymphatic surgery, but it did not prove patency of lymphovenous anastomoses. It was diagnostic in the evaluation of lymphangiectasia and was used to document successful surgical treatment of reflux of chyle. LS is safe and reliable and has no side effects. It should replace contrast lymphangiography in the routine evaluation of the swollen extremity.",

    "abstract": "Four patients with heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies who were not receiving platelet function-inhibiting agents received heparin during surgery, angiography, or hemodialysis. Three of the four patients had complications that were attributed to heparin-induced platelet aggregation. The complications included a superficial femoral artery thrombosis, a thrombotic stroke after a carotid endarterectomy, and recurring thrombosis of a graft inserted for dialysis. Nine patients received aspirin (325 mg b.i.d.) or dipyridamole (Persantine) (200 to 300 mg daily) before reexposure to 5000 to 12,000 units of heparin during 11 vascular procedures. The procedures included two carotid endarterectomies, three aortofemoral bypasses, one femoropopliteal bypass, two femorotibial in situ saphenous vein bypasses, one iliofemoral thrombectomy, one bilateral iliac artery angioplasty, and one axillobifemoral bypass. Platelet counts averaged 173,000/mm3 before heparin reexposure, fell to an average of 86,000/mm3 within 24 hours of heparin reexposure, and returned to normal within 48 hours after the reexposure. None of these patients had a thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complication. Patients with heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies are at risk for developing thrombocytopenia and thromboembolic complications on reexposure to heparin. The platelet function-inhibiting agents, aspirin and Persantine, protect the patients from the thromboembolic complications but not the thrombocytopenia associated with limited heparin reexposure.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the effect of twist on flow through reversed vein segments in vitro and its effect on graft patency in vivo. Excised canine superficial femoral veins were perfused in vitro with normal saline solution or canine blood. Perfusion was carried out at five pressures and against three outflow resistances. Increasing increments of twist were applied to the outflow end of the vein. Flow was measured at each level of twist. With both saline solution and blood, flow was unaltered until twist reached 140 to 180 degrees. Flow then decreased sharply, stopping completely at 175 to 200 degrees of twist. In vivo experiments were then performed in 13 dogs. Reversed superficial femoral veins were used as end-to-end grafts to bypass the iliac arteries. Each graft was deliberately twisted 0, 45, 90, 135, or 200 degrees. All grafts were harvested 6 months after surgery. Eighteen of 20 grafts twisted 135 degrees or less remained patent. However, all five grafts twisted 200 degrees were thrombosed within 4 hours of surgery (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that in patients a slight amount of graft twist probably does not reduce flow; however, more than 135 degrees of twist will greatly reduce flow, leading to early graft thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Among 486 patients undergoing repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) during a 12-year period, 30 (6.2%) had evidence of \"inflammatory\" AAA. One patient (3%) had acute rupture, and six patients (20%) had chronic contained rupture. Ureteral obstruction was evident in 20% of the patients. In the early period of the study there were two postoperative deaths and operative time and blood loss were significantly increased. In the last period of the study, no attempt was made to separate the duodenum and the ureters from the aneurysm; there was no operative mortality, and operative time and blood loss were similar to that of patients with atherosclerotic aneurysms. In 23 of 100 specimens of atherosclerotic AAA, microscopic findings resembling inflammatory AAA were found. On the basis of our study we conclude the following: (1) Inflammatory AAAs are simply atherosclerotic aneurysms that show an unusual accentuation of the chronic inflammation observed in relation to atherosclerotic aneurysms. (2) Operative technique should be modified to avoid excessive dissection and lysis of ureters and duodenum. (3) Excellent early and late results can be expected with proper surgical technique. (4) The causes of AAA are multiple, and chronic contained rupture of the aneurysm and reactive lymphatic hyperplasia might play a role of greater significance than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to assess the major sources of collateral supply to the hypogastric arterial bed (HGA). Peak systolic HGA and radial arterial pressure were obtained before and after clamping a patent HGA and after additional clamping of the contralateral HGA, the contralateral external iliac artery (EIA), or the ipsilateral EIA both selectively and in combinations. These procedures were performed in 10 patients with aortoiliac (AI) aneurysms or occlusive disease. In seven patients with aneurysms, clamping the contralateral HGA decreased the HGA stump pressure index from 0.57 to 0.49 (p less than 0.05), and clamping only the ipsilateral EIA decreased the stump pressure index to 0.38 (p less than 0.001). In three patients with occlusive disease, clamping the contralateral HGA did not decrease the stump pressure index, clamping both the contralateral HGA and EIA decreased the index from 0.61 to 0.57 (p greater than 0.05), and clamping only the ipsilateral EIA decreased the pressure index to 0.40 (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that branches of the ipsilateral EIA femoral arterial system provide a more significant collateral pathway than the contralateral HGA. These results suggest that it is important to relieve occlusive disease in the ipsilateral EIA femoral arterial system if a patent HGA is ligated or bypassed during AI reconstructions. Conversely, it is especially important to preserve forward perfusion in a patent HGA in a patient with compromised ipsilateral EIA femoral runoff.",

    "abstract": "Seventeen patients (15 men and two women) underwent operation for concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and colorectal carcinoma (Ca) during a recent 12-year period. Ages ranged from 59 to 89 years (median 75.2 years). Diameter of the AAA ranged from 3.5 to 9.5 cm (median 5.5 cm). The Ca was staged by the Astler-Coller modification of Dukes' classification as B1 in three patients, B2 in eight, C2 in three, D in two, and unclassified in one. Personal preference, presence of symptoms, and extent of malignant involvement determined preference of resection. The Ca was eventually resected in 16 patients and the AAA in nine. Thirteen patients underwent resection of the Ca first, two the AAA first, and two concomitantly. Eight patients (47%) underwent resection of both the AAA and Ca, eight underwent resection of the Ca only, and one underwent resection of the AAA only. There were three deaths in 24 operations. Follow-up ranged from 5 weeks to 8 years (median 1 1/2 years). Only five patients (29.4%) were long-term survivors without evidence of recurrent Ca and all occurred in the eight patients (62.5%) who had undergone resection of both the Ca and AAA. Three late deaths occurred as a result of complications from the unresected AAA in the eight patients who had undergone resection of the Ca only (37.5%). We conclude that if the Ca is not symptomatic and localized the AAA should be resected first. However, both lesions need to be resected eventually for long-term survival.",

The use of sartorius muscle rotation-transfer specifically in the management of exposed autogenous infrainguinal vein grafts has not been previously described. Eight patients were evaluated for major wound disruption resulting in graft exposure after infrainguinal vein bypass. Soft tissue coverage was provided in all eight cases by means of a distally based sartorius muscle rotation flap. There was no instance of postoperative death, graft thrombosis, secondary hemorrhage, or persistent infection. Late follow-up has shown continued satisfactory results. We conclude that effective soft tissue coverage and salvage of exposed infrainguinal vein bypass grafts can be accomplished in selected cases by means of sartorius muscle rotation-transfer.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience with impedance plethysmography (IPG) and duplex scanning in the diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) to determine their respective accuracy and current role in our noninvasive vascular laboratory. During a recent 22-month period 1776 patients were evaluated in our laboratory for DVT. Sixty patients (64 limbs) underwent ascending venography within 48 hours of testing (49 limbs were evaluated by all three modalities). With the venograms used as the reference standard, B-mode scanning correctly identified the presence of acute thrombus in 24 of 27 limbs (88.8%) and the absence of thrombus in 31 of 34 limbs (91.2%), for an overall accuracy of 90.6%. IPG alone was less sensitive (75%) and less specific (44.8%), with an overall accuracy of only 57.1%. Twenty-eight IPGs were performed on patients with negative venous scans. Two positive IPGs were the result of chronic venous occlusion and two others detected clinically significant isolated iliac vein thrombi, but 13 patients had false positive IPGs. One false negative IPG occurred. The difference in the sensitivity of scan alone vs scan plus IPG was not significant (chi 2 = 0.045; difference not significant), but the decrease in specificity was chi 2 = 17.3; p less than 0.001). The rarity of isolated iliac vein thrombosis and the high false positive rate for IPG do not justify its continued use if B-mode venous scanning is available. Although positive scan results may be used confidently to institute therapy without the need for venography, in high-risk patients with a strong clinical suspicion of proximal DVT despite a negative scan venography should be obtained before withholding anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "Ten mongrel dogs underwent left lower extremity in situ femoropopliteal bypass with femoral vein. A 20 to 25 cm myocutaneous bridge was left between femoral and popliteal anastomoses. A 2.8 mm angioscope was introduced intraluminally to visualize venous tributaries (VT). A balloon occlusion catheter was placed alongside the angioscope and directed in each VT. Prolamine was injected into each VT to effect occlusion. Seven dogs were followed up for 1 week and three dogs for 1 month. A total of 34 VT (range one to five per dog) were available for attempted occlusion. Twenty-nine of 84 (85%) VT were able to be occluded based on comparison of pre-VT and post-VT occlusion angiograms. Poor visualization of VT or VT too small to admit the 5F catheter were reasons for failure. We conclude that (1) in the canine model studied angioscope-assisted occlusion of femoropopliteal during bypass is technically feasible, (2) this technical detail makes unnecessary medial thigh dissection for exposure of the vein graft, and (3) during short-term observation prolamine appeared to be a suitable occluding substance.",

Intraoperative ultrasonography was used to assess the technical adequacy of 80 carotid endarterectomies. Sixty-two arteries were normal on intraoperative ultrasound examination, whereas the remaining 18 arteries had a total of 21 minor residual technical defects. The 21 minor defects consisted of four internal carotid artery lesions, nine common carotid artery lesions, and eight external carotid artery lesions, 19 had 1 to 3 mm intimal flaps, and two had small stenoses. Sixteen of the 19 intimal flaps resolved before the first postoperative ultrasound study. These arteries had normal examination results, which indicated that these intimal flaps had healed. The two stenoses detected intraoperatively could not be detected by postoperative carotid duplex scanning at 1 month follow-up. No statistically significant relationship was found between the presence of a minor residual defect on intraoperative ultrasonography and the subsequent development of recurrent stenosis or occlusion in any of the arteries assessed. These data suggest that certain minor technical defects in the carotid artery that were detected by intraoperative ultrasonography are benign and may not require repeat exploration of the carotid artery for repair.",

There is debate over the best method of direct reconstruction. Twenty-six patients undergoing transsternal innominate artery repair over a 12-year period were reviewed to determine if either grafting or endarterectomy was superior and what technical factors might be responsible for success or failure. Most of the patients were women. Twenty-four of the patients had atherosclerotic lesions, whereas the other two had Takayasu's arteritis. Either neurologic or right upper extremity symptoms were present in 24 patients. Sixteen patients had grafting, and 10 underwent endarterectomy. There was one death. There were no strokes or transient ischemic attacks. Three patients experienced recurrence of their symptoms; all had failures of reconstruction. The use of a bifurcated graft in one patient was probably responsible for one recurrence of symptoms. Single limb grafts with added side arms are probably preferable to bifurcated grafts. Innominate artery grafting and innominate endarterectomy are equally effective, although grafting is applicable to more patients. Direct transsternal repair is the procedure of choice to correct innominate occlusive disease in patients who are good candidates for correction.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study compared the results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with those of infrainguinal bypass procedures in patients with critical arterial ischemia to determine which procedure had superior patency, limb salvage, and durability. The records of 54 patients who underwent 54 PTAs and 56 patients who underwent 63 infrainguinal bypasses (29 femoropopliteal and 34 femorodistal) from 1981 to 1987 were reviewed. In each patient PTA or bypass was the initial vascular procedure. Patients in both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, and the presence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. Mean follow-up was 40 months (4 to 88 months) for the PTA group and 28 months (6 to 78 months) for the surgery group. Thirty-nine of the 54 patients (72%) were initially improved after PTA, whereas 15 patients (28%) showed no improvement. During follow-up, 20 initially successful PTAs reoccluded. Thirty-two of 54 patients (59%) underwent subsequent procedures, which included repeat PTA (10) and distal bypass (14). Patency determined by noninvasive Doppler studies was 18% at 2 years. Limb salvage, which included such secondary procedures, was 78%. Two-year patency for femoropopliteal bypasses was 68% with a limb salvage of 90%. Femorodistal bypasses had a 2-year patency of 47% and a limb salvage of 74%. No perioperative deaths occurred. Twenty-one of the 63 patients (33%) had subsequent procedures, which included thrombectomy (5) and bypass revision (9). In patients treated for limb-threatening ischemia the 2-year patency after femoropopliteal bypass (68%) or femorodistal bypass (47%) is significantly better than that from PTA (18%, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Culture of prosthetic material is routinely used to exclude or implicate infection in the pathogenesis of late-appearing graft complications. In a canine model of aortic graft infection caused by a bacterial biofilm, the influence of culture media (blood agar and tryptic soy broth) and mechanical surface biofilm disruption (tissue grinding and ultrasonic oscillation) on microorganism recovery was determined. Dacron prostheses colonized in vitro with Staphylococcus epidermidis were implanted in the infrarenal aortas of 36 dogs. After 3 weeks an infection with anatomic characteristics of late graft infection in humans was present. Explantation (+/- surface biofilm disruption) of infected grafts showed broth culture was superior (p less than 0.001) to agar media in confirming infection. The recovery rate of S. epidermidis was 30% with agar media, was 72% with broth media alone, and was 83% with broth media plus biofilm disruption. In situ replacement of infected grafts plus parenteral antibiotics resulted in early (1 month) healing of 31 grafts without signs of infection. All replacement grafts were sterile when cultured in broth media alone, but the addition of biofilm disruption isolated the study strain from eight (22%) of 36 grafts (p less than 0.01). Biofilm disruption by tissue grinding or sonication increased bacteria recovery equally. When biofilm bacterial concentration was less than 100 colony-forming units/cm2 of graft, only culture in broth media reliably recovered microorganisms. In the absence of perigraft inflammation, microbiologic recovery techniques that identify bacterial biofilms are necessary to exclude infection in studies concerning the pathogenesis of late graft complications or the treatment of S. epidermidis prosthetic infections.",

    "abstract": "Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, seeded with autologous venous endothelial cells at the time of implantation, subsequently develop endothelial linings. However, it has not been shown whether the endothelial cells in these linings are derived from the seeded cells, or whether the seeding process itself stimulates host endothelial cells to proliferate and cover the grafts. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, bilateral end-to-side aortoiliac expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts with an internal diameter of 6 mm, an internodal distance of 22 microns, and an average length of 9.2 cm were placed in 10 adult mongrel dogs weighing 20 to 25 kg; the aorta was ligated just distal to the origin of the grafts. The graft on one side, chosen at random, was seeded with autologous endothelium that was harvested by enzyme single-stage technique from external jugular veins; the other side was not seeded. After 4 weeks the animals were anesthetized and heparinized, and the grafts were fixed by perfusion in vivo with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution before they were removed. Both grafts occluded in two animals, and both grafts were patent in five animals. In two animals the seeded grafts were open and the unseeded grafts were occluded. In one the seeded graft was occluded and the unseeded graft was patent. There was no significant difference in clot-free surface area between seeded (29% +/- 18%) and unseeded (31% +/- 11%) grafts. Scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of an endothelial monolayer that averaged 39% +/- 20% and 36% +/- 26% coverage, respectively, in the clot-free midgraft portions of all seeded and unseeded patent grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Vascular reconstruction often preserves renal function, but renal failure is rarely reversed, especially after days of anuria. We report a case of a 23-year-old woman who as a child underwent a nephrectomy for congenital hydroureter and renal hypoplasia. She later experienced fibromuscular dysplasia of the remaining renal artery, which ultimately progressed to a complete occlusion and 31 days of total anuria. The patient was revascularized, and within 2 months renal function returned with a blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 9.0 and 1.0 mg/dl, respectively. After a follow-up of 6 months the patient's blood pressure remained 120/80 to 130/80 mm Hg without administration of hypertension medication. In this report we emphasize that under selected circumstances a kidney can survive prolonged ischemia and that delayed revascularization may reestablish renal function.",

    "abstract": "Because of the high incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients undergoing aortic surgery, and because myocardial oxygen consumption is proportional to blood pressure x heart rate (HR) (pressure-rate product), it is important to prevent increases in these parameters postoperatively. The effect of verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist, on these parameters was evaluated in 30 patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstruction. Postoperatively HR increased 27% in 19 patients without CAD and 47% in 11 patients with CAD. Pressure-rate product (blood pressure x HR) increased 17% and 31% in these two groups, respectively. Verapamil was able to reduce postoperative HR by 3% in patients without CAD and by 13% in patients with CAD. Verapamil reduced pressure-rate product 8% and 18%, respectively, in the two groups. These reductions were statistically significant in patients with CAD and occurred without reductions in cardiac output or left ventricular ejection fraction. Thus the postoperative increases in myocardial oxygen demand appeared to be primarily related to increased HR after aortic surgery, and these were reduced by verapamil without impairing blood flow or cardiac function.",

    "abstract": "Protamine sulfate has been observed to interfere with the control of isolated mitochondrial respiration in vitro. This study was designed to determine if oxygen consumption changes in intact animals occur in vivo during protamine administration. Oxygen consumption was assessed in seven dogs anticoagulated with heparin (150 IU/kg) and reversed 30 minutes later with protamine sulfate (1.5 mg/kg). Oxygen saturations measured included arterial (SaO2 arterial), mixed venous (SvO2 systemic), jugular (SvO2 jugular), portal (SvO2 portal), and coronary (SvO2 coronary). Cardiac output (CO) and carotid artery flow determinations allowed calculation of systemic oxygen consumption (VO2 systemic) and cerebral oxygen consumption VO2 cerebral. Hemodynamic measurements included arterial blood pressure (BP), pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures (PAS, PAD), and heart rate (HR). Protamine sulfate administration resulted in hypotension (delta BP -64 mm Hg), pulmonary hypertension (delta PAS + 13 mm Hg, delta PAD + 11 mm Hg), and bradycardia (delta HR -30). Shortly after protamine administration, CO fell 54% and carotid artery flow fell more than 50%, yet declines in SvO2 systemic and SvO2 jugular were not observed. In fact these parameters increased 3% and 2%, respectively. VO2 systemic fell 55% and VO2 cerebral fell 57%. Similarly, SvO2 portal and SvO2 coronary increased 6% and 9%, respectively. Significant correlations existed between changes in VO2 systemic and BP (r = 0.05, p less than 0.001), HR (r = 0.3, p less than 0.01, PAD (r = -0.3, p less than 0.05, and CO (r = 0.8, p less than 0.001). Impaired oxygen utilization was most evident during the first 5 minutes after protamine administration. This investigation, for the first time, establishes that protamine sulfate decreases in vivo oxygen consumption, a finding that may account for certain of the drug's adverse side effects.",

The fistula was successfully repaired, with preservation of the kidney, by autotransfusion. Review of the English language literature revealed the differences between spontaneous and traumatic ALRVF. Spontaneous fistulas were caused by rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm into a retroaortic left renal vein. Hematuria was almost constant (93% of cases). The operative mortality rate was 14%. By contrast, traumatic ALRVFs were the result of a penetrating wound to the abdomen. The left renal vein was in a normal position, anterior to the aorta. Hematuria was less common (16% of cases). The diagnosis was delayed because clinical signs were less acute. There were no reports of postoperative deaths.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPo2) measurements of calf and brachial skin were performed on 40 patients before they underwent below-knee amputation (BKA); dual calf measurements on the anterior and posterior skin were obtained. Both anterior and posterior calf tcPo2 values were significantly lower in patients with unsuccessful wound healing after BKA compared to those with successful healing (p less than 0.01). Successful wound healing occurred in 50% (6/12) of patients with calf tcPo2 values less than 20 torr and in 96% (27/28) of patients with calf tcPo2 values greater than 20 torr. Calculation of a critical Po2 index (defined as the lesser of the anterior and posterior calf/brachial tcPo2 ratios) resulted in improved predictive accuracy; 100% (6/6) of patients with a critical Po2 index of 0.20 or less had unsuccessful wound healing after BKA, whereas 97% (33/34) of patients with a critical Po2 index greater than 0.20 had successful healing. The use of a critical Po2 index greater than 0.20 as predictive of successful healing after BKA was associated with a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 100%, 86%, and 98%, respectively, compared to 82%, 86%, and 83%, respectively, by use of absolute calf tcPo2 values. In conclusion, multisensor transcutaneous oximetric mapping is an accurate method for predicting wound healing success after BKA. Measurement of both anterior and posterior calf tcPo2 should be performed; calf tcPo2 values less than 20 torr may indicate local ischemia, but ischemia should be confirmed by comparison of calf tcPo2 with brachial tcPo2 before the patient is denied BKA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 1984, 55 operative procedures were carried out in 47 patients to correct subclavian-axillary artery lesions resulting from compression at the thoracic outlet. The most common causes of compression were a long cervical rib (27) and an anomalous first rib (15). Presenting features included claudication, vasomotor phenomena, digital gangrene, and acute limb-threatening ischemia. A combined supraclavicular and infraclavicular approach was preferred. Decompression was best achieved by excision of the cervical rib and the first rib and division of all soft tissue elements. The most common methods of arterial repair were resection-anastomosis (23) and replacement of vein graft (11). Embolic occlusions were frequently present (35). Axillary emboli were amenable to direct revascularization at the time of subclavian artery repair. If possible, more-distal embolic occlusions were managed without recourse to embolectomy catheter manipulations. The mean follow-up was 5 years 8 months (range 4 months to 16 years). Patients were assessed clinically, and the arterial repair was monitored by Doppler ultrasonography, B-mode scanning, and digital subtraction angiography. Of the 39 patients available for follow-up, 35 had no symptoms and four had residual claudication. There were no amputations. In the remaining cases the subclavian-axillary artery segment showed no hemodynamic or anatomic abnormality.",

    "abstract": "This study tests the hypothesis that reperfusion injury is the principal cause of limb loss after acute arterial occlusion and that this injury is avoidable. Of 61 isolated hindlimbs amputated at the level of the hip joint, 17 were controls (group I), 5 were perfused without ischemia to establish the validity of the model (group II), and 15 underwent 4 hours of ischemia at room temperature without reperfusion (group III). Acute embolectomy was simulated in 24 limbs after 4 hours of ischemia; 12 were reperfused with standard Krebs-Henseleit solution at 100 mm Hg (group IV), and 12 were reperfused under controlled conditions (i.e., 37 degrees C, 50 mm Hg) with substrate-enriched modified reperfusate (group V). Leg volume, water content, contractile function, and high-energy phosphate content were assessed and data were expressed as mean +/- SD. Four hours of ischemia caused a profound fall in adenosine triphosphate content (4.0 vs 26.0 mmol/L/gm of protein, p less than or equal to 0.001). Uncontrolled reperfusion resulted in severe reperfusion injury; massive edema developed (83% vs 75%, p less than or equal to 0.01), leg volume increased markedly (21.5% above control, p less than or equal to 0.001), and no contractile function followed electrical stimulation. In contrast, controlled reperfusion resulted in normal water content (76.9% vs 75.0%, NS) and minimal change of leg volume (5.5% +/- 5% of control, NS), replenished adenosine triphosphate completely (24.2 vs 26.4 mmol/L/gm of protein, NS), and restored immediate contractile function in all limbs (24.3% +/- 14% of control). This study shows that 4 hours of room-temperature ischemia (18 degrees C) does not produce irreversible damage of the rat hindlimb because the reperfusion injury that follows uncontrolled reperfusion can be avoided. Immediate recovery of contractile function can be restored if the conditions of reperfusion are controlled by gentle reperfusion pressure (50 mm Hg) at 37 degrees C and if a modified substrate-enriched, hyperosmotic, alkalotic, low-Ca++ reperfusate is administered.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of atenolol, a beta 1-selective blocker, along with flunarizine, a calcium antagonist, in the management of Raynaud's disease. Forty patients with Raynaud's disease were randomized into a trial in which atenolol (50 mg daily) was given with flunarizine (10 mg daily). During the trial all patients were subjected to finger photoplethysmography and were given a diary to note daily the number and duration of the crises and presence or absence of pain and paresthesia. The association of atenolol with flunarizine caused an 80% reduction in the number of vasospastic crises, a significant increase (p less than 0.001) in the photoplethysmographic wave amplitude, and complete disappearance of pain and paresthesia. These results were not observed in patients treated with a placebo. Flunarizine reinforces the action of atenolol in causing a decrease in vasoconstriction in patients with Raynaud's disease, as observed previously by us, in that it acts directly on the beta-presynaptic receptors or on the calcium slow channels connected to the beta-receptors.

    "abstract": "The rapid establishment of an endothelial cell (EC) monolayer on the luminal surface of small-diameter vascular grafts may be necessary to prevent early thrombosis and failure. We have studied procedures used to promote EC coverage of vascular grafts and have compared preclotting prosthetic surfaces with ECs in platelet-rich plasma (seeding) with plating ECs onto a preestablished clot (sodding). We evaluated the rate of monolayer formation, the subsequent resistance to shear stress, and the effects of EC growth factors (ECGF and heparin) on these functions. Woven Dacron was seeded or sodded at a density of 2 x 10(5) cells/cm2 with human adult microvessel ECs derived from adipose tissue. In the presence of ECGF-heparin, the immediate establishment of an EC layer after sodding was observed, whereas seeded grafts required almost 48 hours for cells to reach the surface. In the absence of ECGF-heparin, sodded grafts still exhibited a complete monolayer of EC, whereas ECs were not observed at the surface of seeded grafts after 48 hours. After exposure to shear stress (up to 20 dynes/cm2) for 2 hours, most freshly sodded EC remained attached; however, the loss of loosely adherent cells did occur. EC seeded grafts remained covered with fibrin matrix after exposure to shear stress. We conclude that the use of a microvessel sodding technique as an alternative to previously reported seeding techniques is necessary for the immediate formation of an EC monolayer before implantation.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic sclerotherapy has been widely advocated as primary therapy for patients surviving hemorrhage from esophageal varices. The potential for endoscopic sclerotherapy to limit subsequent surgical options remains unclear. The following study was undertaken to assess the endoscopic sclerotherapy-related incidence of splanchnic venous thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery for variceal bleeding. We retrospectively identified 27 patients who underwent portosystemic shunting after an episode of variceal hemorrhage documented by endoscopic examination. Eleven patients underwent endoscopic sclerotherapy before portosystemic surgery for shunting. Among the patients undergoing prior endoscopic sclerotherapy, 6/11 had partial splanchnic venous thrombosis at surgery compared with 2/16 in the non-endoscopic sclerotherapy group. This difference was statistically significant. Only one of the eight patients with splenic or portal vein thrombosis detected at surgery showed signs of the condition when an angiograph was performed. Endoscopic sclerotherapy appears to impose a significant risk for splanchnic venous thrombosis. This complication, not reliably detected by angiographic means, may limit the operative options and long-term outcomes of patients in whom endoscopic sclerotherapy fails.",

    "abstract": "A 9-year prospective study of 542 consecutive patients undergoing operation by one of the authors for abdominal aortic aneurysms was undertaken to define the incidence, clinical behavior, and anatomic characteristics of familial abdominal aortic aneurysms. Eighty-two (15.1%) patients having surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms were found to have a first-degree relative with an aneurysm, as compared to nine (1.8%) of a control group of 500 patients of similar age and sex without aneurysmal disease (p less than 0.001). Detailed analysis was next performed of the pedigree charts of patients with a positive family history of aneurysm who underwent repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms by all authors over the 9-year study period. This review identified a total study population of 86 families with 209 first-degree relatives with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Clinical and anatomic features of this familial group were compared to those of 460 patients operated on for abdominal aortic aneurysms who had no family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Patients with familial abdominal aortic aneurysms were more likely to be women (35% vs 14%), and men with familial abdominal aortic aneurysms tended to be about 5 years younger than the women. There was no significant difference between the patients with nonfamilial and familial abdominal aortic aneurysms in anatomic extent of aneurysmal disease, multiplicity of aneurysms, associated occlusive disease, or blood type. There was a history of aneurysm rupture in 35 of 86 (40.7%) families with familial abdominal aortic aneurysms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Although the growth and rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly explained by Laplace's law, the final events that precede aneurysm rupture are not fully understood. Local excrescences within the wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms were observed in four of five patients studied with preoperative CT scanning, and were removed from six patients at the time of surgery. These protrusions were filled with thrombus, and on histologic examination marked attenuation of the aortic wall, focal loss of elastic fibers, and inflammatory cell infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasional multinucleate giant cells were seen. The presence of these blebs and their microscopic characteristics suggest their potential as a mechanism for rupture and recognition of this deformity by use of abdominal CT scanning may indicate the necessity for prompt surgical intervention. Further careful clinicopathologic correlation is required to clearly establish these localized defects in the aneurysm wall as a cause for rupture.",

    "abstract": "Near-total or total blindness caused by chronic ocular ischemia is a well-recognized complication of severe atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the carotid artery (CA) but has not been previously reported in the English-language literature as a sequela of an occlusive CA injury. This report describes a patient who sustained a gunshot wound to the neck, which injured the ipsilateral internal CA, external CA, and vertebral artery. The location of the injuries precluded arterial repair. The patient was neurologically intact after operative exploration. Twenty months after the injury a marked loss of vision in the ipsilateral eye was detected. Chronic ocular ischemia was diagnosed from clinical findings and ophthalmoscopic examination results. Knowledge that chronic ocular ischemia and blindness can occur after an occlusive CA injury supports the use of primary arterial repair for all CA injuries. In those instances in which repair is not technically possible, frequent ophthalmoscopic examinations and testing of visual acuity should be used postoperatively to diagnose ocular ischemia; thus treatment to prevent the loss of sight can be carried out.",

    "abstract": "The magnitude and distribution of muscle blood flow in the lower extremity after relief of an acute arterial occlusion may influence the extent of the resulting necrosis. The object of this study was to document the distribution of blood flow in the resting state and after prolonged periods of complete ischemia, and to assess the relationship between the degree of reactive hyperemia and subsequent necrosis. The isolated bilateral canine gracilis muscle preparation that we have previously characterized was used for microsphere studies. Total blood flow was measured by means of timed venous collections, and the distribution of flow was determined by means of a multiple microsphere injection technique. Measurements of microsphere distribution and blood flow were made before ischemia and during the initial 48 minutes of reperfusion after both 4 and 5 hours of normothermic ischemia, which resulted in 46.7% +/- 6% and 71.2% +/- 7% necrosis, respectively. The muscle was harvested and sectioned transversely into six slices approximately 1.5 cm thick, and the extent of necrosis was quantified by means of nitroblue tetrazolium staining 48 hours after reperfusion. Blood flow distribution during the early reperfusion phase was determined in each muscle slice and in both the alive and dead portions of each slice by use of the microsphere injection technique. Preischemic blood flow was distributed homogeneously throughout the muscle and was 4.5 +/- 0.8 ml/100 gm/min (mean +/- SEM, n = 8). On reperfusion total flow was 6 to 10 times higher than it was before ischemia and was distributed predominantly to the middle slices (p less than 0.05, n = 12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

All patients were evaluated clinically by the same cardiologist and had exercise stress testing and dipyridamole-thallium imaging before admission for surgery. Ten patients were excluded from the study because they had evidence of severe ischemia when tested (ST segment depression greater than 2 mm on exercise testing, severe multivessel disease on thallium imaging). The remaining 60 patients were operated on (abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, 40; aortobifemoral repair, 17; femorofemoral graft, 3). The test results were withheld from the surgeon, anesthetist, and cardiologist before surgery. A total of 22 patients experienced major cardiac complications postoperatively (acute pulmonary edema, 17; acute myocardial, infarction, 5; cardiac death, 2). Thallium imaging showed myocardial ischemia in 31/60 patients. Exercise testing was positive (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST segment depression) in 10/60 patients. Dipyridamole-thallium imaging with a high sensitivity and reasonable specificity is the initial test of choice. Exercise testing is a poor screening test because of its low sensitivity. The combination of the two tests gives the highest positive predictive value and the greatest likelihood ratio. Thus patients assessed initially and found to have positive thallium scan results may be further stratified by exercise testing.",

    "abstract": "The ability to diagnose and localize vascular graft infections has been a major challenge. Recent studies in animal models and humans with focal bacterial infection have shown that radiolabeled, polyclonal, human immunoglobulin G accumulates at the site of inflammation and can serve as the basis for an imaging technique. This study investigated this new technique for the diagnosis and localization of vascular graft infections. Twenty-five patients with suspected vascular infections involving grafts (22), atherosclerotic aneurysms (2), and subclavian vein thrombophlebitis (1) were studied. Gamma camera images of the suspected area were obtained between 5 and 48 hours after intravenous administration of 1.5 to 2.0 mCi (56 to 74 mBq) of indium 111-labeled, human, polyclonal immunoglobulin G. Scan results were interpreted without clinical information about the patient and were subsequently correlated with surgical findings, other imaging modalities, and/or clinical follow-up. In 10 of 10 patients found to have positive scan results, localized infections were confirmed at the involved sites. In 14 of 15 patients whose scan results were interpreted as negative, no vascular infections were identified at follow-up. The patient with false-negative results and recurrent bacteremia from an aortoduodenal fistula was found to have a negative scan outcome at a time when his disease was quiescent. These data suggest that nonspecific, human, indium 111-labeled immunoglobulin G scanning can be a useful noninvasive means of localizing vascular infections.",

    "abstract": "We have compared in baboons the capacity of two types of synthetic vascular grafts to accumulate thrombus, activate circulating platelets, and generate occlusive platelet microemboli. Grafts were incorporated into femoral arterial-arterial shunts placed unilaterally in 10 baboons; the unoperated contralateral limbs served as controls. The accumulation of indium 111 (111In)-labeled platelets onto the grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [ePTFE] or knitted Dacron, 4 mm inner diameter) and the appearance of 111In radioactivity in distal microcirculatory beds (calf and foot) were quantified by dynamic scintillation camera imaging. After 1 hour total platelet deposition per graft was higher with Dacron (49.0 +/- 8.0 x 10(9) platelets) than with ePTFE (3.7 +/- 0.6 x 10(9) platelets, p less than 0.01). Platelet counts decreased and beta-thromboglobulin levels increased with Dacron graft placement but were unaffected by ePTFE graft placement (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Emboli shed from Dacron grafts were detected as multifocal, irregular, and changing deposits in the calves and feet. Indium 111 platelet activity in the feet distal to the Dacron grafts increased 81.1% +/- 21.4% from baseline values over 1 hour, whereas the activities in the feet distal to the ePTFE grafts were unchanged (p less than 0.05). The increase 111In-platelet radioactivity above the control limb values (excess radioactivity) was higher for the Dacron graft group than for the ePTFE group in both the feet (139.6% +/- 46.9% vs 6.2%, p less than 0.05) and the calves (86.7% +/- 21.7% vs 7.3% +/- 3.6%, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities is uncommon in young adults. Between 1983 and 1988 we undertook an aggressive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of claudication in young patients. Thirty-three patients (30 men and three women) with the onset of significant claudication at age 40 years or younger underwent arteriography after noninvasive evaluation. The mean duration of symptoms was 2 years, and six patients had suffered claudication for 4 years or longer. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease was found in 19 patients (58%), delayed presentation of traumatic occlusion was found in four (12%), congenital arteriopathy was found in four (12%), vasculitis was found in five (15%), and one patient (3%) had normal arteriogram results despite a history and physical examination that suggested inflow disease. Management included percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in eight patients (24%) and operative reconstruction in 17 (52%). Seven patients (21%) were treated nonoperatively (five had unreconstructible distal disease and two declined operation). During a mean follow-up of 33 months, three patients who continued to smoke required either repeat PTA or operation for recurrent disease, one patient underwent repeat aortic reconstruction for early operative failure, and one patient with vasculitis required revision of an in situ vein graft for aneurysmal dilatation. The success rates of PTA and surgical reconstruction were encouraging. However, in the group with atherosclerotic occlusive vascular disease, the inability to abstain from smoking suggests a poor prognosis for long-term success.",

    "abstract": "The many reports on the use of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for treating lower-extremity ischemia were analyzed to determine the outcomes of femoropopliteal PTA used in patients with intermittent claudication (IC) and with more severe limb-threatening ischemia (\"salvage\"). The Confidence Profile Method was used to interpret and adjust the evidence from 12 selected clinical reports, and to combine the data into single best estimates of the outcomes that were considered important for decision making. The following combined estimates were obtained: The early success rate was 89% +/- 2.5% after PTA for IC, compared with 77% +/- 4% after PTA for salvage. The largest decline in patency occurred during the first 6 to 12 months. After 2 years there was little further attrition. Three-year patency was 62% +/- 9% for IC and 43% +/- 7% for salvage. The risk of procedure-related mortality and limb loss was low, estimated at 0.5% and 1%, respectively. The risk of serious complications requiring surgical repair was about 2.5%. The Confidence Profile Method is a novel way of obtaining this information from the imperfect clinical literature. The method incorporates subjective judgments and assumptions and gives quantitative and visual representations of both the magnitude of the estimated outcome and the uncertainty associated with it. The results are as strong as the assumptions incorporated in them are valid. The estimates derived in this study can be used for any decision on the use of PTA in the femoropopliteal segment.",

    "abstract": "During a 27-month period laser thermal angioplasty (LTA) was attempted in 15 patients who had totally occluded segments of their superficial femoral--popliteal arteries (SFA) with limb-threatening ischemia (rest pain or tissue necrosis). In five patients (33%) laser perforation of the SFA precluded successful angioplasty, and those five patients have been excluded from further analysis. In the remaining 10 patients the prelaser angiogram demonstrated an average SVS/ISCVS runoff score of 7.7 (best possible score, 1; worst possible score, 10). Seven patients (70%) had occlusions of all infrapopliteal arteries. All 10 patients were available for clinical follow-up, and follow-up angiograms were available for eight patients (80%). Clinical failure was defined as recurrence of the clinical signs or symptoms for which the LTA was performed. After 6 months of follow-up clinical failures occurred in nine patients (90%). Four patients had no clinical improvement. Five patients had transient clinical improvement after LTA, and all subsequently had early recurrence of symptoms. The average time from LTA to recurrence of symptoms was 1.7 months. Seven patients had subsequent bypasses or amputations an average of 2.2 months after laser angioplasty. The SFA patency rate by life-table analysis was 25% at 6 months. The single patient with clinical success (at 12 months) had no tibial vessel disease evident on his prelaser angiogram, and he underwent a concomitant inflow procedure at the time of his LTA. We believe that the disappointing results in this small series of patients can be attributed to tibial vessel disease that was not addressed by this technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To study the morbidity and mortality rates after placement of an inferior vena cava filter and to define the appropriate indications for interruption of the inferior vena cava, the records of all patients who underwent insertion of a Greenfield filter during the decade January 1978 to December 1987 were reviewed. Patients were designated as having either a traditional or extended indication for placement of an inferior vena cava filter. Two hundred sixty inferior vena cava filters were placed in 264 attempts, with no deaths related to insertion of the filter. An extended indication was the primary reason for placement of the Greenfield filter in 66 (25%) of the patients. In patients with extended indications there were no cases of air embolism or filter misplacement and only three wound complications (4.5%). Pulmonary embolism after insertion of the inferior vena cava filter occurred in three patients (4.5%), with one fatality (1.5%). Inferior vena cava occlusion was documented in three cases (4.5%), and manifestations of the postphlebitic syndrome in early follow-up were present in two patients (3.0%). As the procedures to prevent fatal pulmonary embolism have become safer, more efficacious, and less morbid, the number of patients in whom the potential benefits of insertion of an inferior vena cava filter outweigh the risks has become larger. Our results support the liberalized use of Greenfield filters in those patients who do not necessarily have one of the traditional indications for placement of an inferior vena cava filter but are at a high risk of having a fatal pulmonary embolus.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophilic leukocytes have been implicated as important mediators of ischemic myocardial injury. We investigated the role of neutrophils in skeletal muscle ischemia/reperfusion injury by using the rat hindlimb ischemia model. We rendered Wistar rats neutropenic by administering 750 rad of whole-body radiation (mean white blood cell count, 300 +/- 50/mm3; 3 days after radiation). In anesthetized rats (10 neutropenic and 10 control), 3 hours of ischemia were induced in one hindlimb by application of a tourniquet to the proximal thigh; the contralateral limb served as an internal, nonischemic control. After 1 hour of reperfusion the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were excised bilaterally and evaluated for ischemic injury by means of a quantitative spectrophotometric assay of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction. In control rats the reduction of TTC by ischemic muscle averaged 27.0% +/- 7.3% of that by nonischemic muscle; whereas in neutropenic rats the value for ischemic muscle was 65.4 +/- 11.6% (p less than 0.05). To determine if the contribution of the neutrophils to ischemic injury is due to oxygen-derived free radical formation, an additional 10 animals were infused with 5000 units of super-oxide dismutase and 10,000 units of catalase at the time reperfusion was restored. After treatment with free radical scavengers, TTC reduction by ischemic limbs was 25.5% +/- 7.0% of that by nonischemic limbs and did not differ from that in control animals (p greater than 0.05). The results show a protective effect of neutropenia and suggest a significant role of the white cell in the pathophysiology of ischemic skeletal muscle injury.",

    "abstract": "A total of 16,350 patients underwent cardiac catheterization from January 1981 to December 1987. The brachial artery was used in 10,500 patients (group I), and the femoral artery was used in 5850 patients (group II). Surgical intervention for complications was necessary in 60 (0.57%) of the group I patients and in 14 (0.23%) of the group II patients. Hand ischemia in group I and bleeding in group II were the most frequent indications for operation. Procedures performed were segmental resection, vein interposition, and long bypass in group I, and simple suture and angioplasty were performed in group II. Fifty-six patients of the total of 74 underwent early repair (within 48 hours), and 18 patients underwent delayed intervention. Only one (1.7%) of the 56 patients who had early repair had a complication. Five of the 18 patients (28%) with delayed intervention suffered significant complications. Cardiac catheterization by the brachial or femoral route has a low incidence of complications. Delayed intervention is associated with high morbidity despite adequate restoration of circulation. Although there were fewer complications in the femoral group, they were far more serious with respect to life- or limb-threatening events.",

    "abstract": "Experience with 1035 carotid endarterectomies in a single community over a 2-year period was analyzed. Twenty-two surgeons working in six hospitals were involved. All surgeons had full-time or part-time appointments at the University of Rochester, 18 had special interest in vascular surgery, and eight had obtained a certificate of qualification in vascular surgery. Mortality rate was 1.4% (14 deaths), with additional permanent, nonfatal, neurologic morbidity of 3.4%. Mortality and morbidity were independent of surgeon, caseload, or hospital. Age and prior history of myocardial infarction influenced the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction but not the incidence of death or neurologic morbidity. Factors that increased the risk of postoperative death or neurologic complication included hypertension; contralateral carotid disease as manifested by stroke, endarterectomy, or occlusion; whether the patient was a woman; and symptoms of crescendo ischemia. Lack of preoperative neurologic symptoms was correlated with decreased risk of myocardial infarction and neurologic complications. Overall mortality and neurologic morbidity associated with operation for \"asymptomatic stenosis\" was 3.1% (seven of 222 cases). However, the incidence of contralateral carotid disease was high in the patients in the asymptomatic group (60%), and all complications in this group occurred in patients with prior contralateral carotid endarterectomy or occlusion (p less than 0.05).",

    "abstract": "Budd-Chiari syndrome is an unusual form of portal hypertension caused by occlusion of the hepatic venous outflow, and it is often confused with portal hypertension caused by liver cirrhosis. Its prognosis is poor, and optimal therapy remains to be established. This is a report of 100 confirmed cases of this syndrome treated from December 1982 to March 1988 at two vascular centers in China. Sixty-two male and 38 female patients, 15 to 62 years of age (mean age, 32.6 years) were treated. Seventy-six patients had intractable ascites, 56 had esophageal varices, and 22 had upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There were 37 cases of membranous obstruction, 57 cases of occlusion of the inferior vena cava above the confluence of the hepatic veins, and 6 cases of occlusion of the hepatic veins. Eighty-one patients were operated on. Operative mortality rate was 8.6% (7/81). Follow-up from 2 to 66 months revealed that 58 of the patients operated on (72%) had good results, whereas 11 of 19 (58%) patients treated nonoperatively died within 2 months after admission. On the basis of these data we conclude that the operative procedure must be tailored to the cause and underlying pathologic characteristics. Mesoatrial shunting is the operation of choice for patients with occlusion of the retrohepatic inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, and inferior vena cava--atrial shunting is the operation of choice for patients with occlusion of the inferior vena cava and patency of the hepatic veins. Membranotomy is used for patients with inferior vena cava webbing, and mesocaval shunting is used for patients with intrahepatic venous occlusion only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The effect of steroids and immunosuppression on the development of intimal hyperplasia was studied in 24 New Zealand white rabbits. Staged bilateral arteriotomy and stripping of intima of the common carotid artery was performed by means of a 2F balloon catheter under 700 mm Hg of pressure. At 3 months, after the control side artery was harvested (N = 24), the rabbits were assigned to three groups of eight animals each: (1) dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg, (2) cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 1 mg/kg, or (3) azathioprine 1 mg/kg intramuscularly. The animals were treated on the day before the contralateral intimal stripping and then were treated six times a week for 8 weeks; the vessels were harvested at 3 months. Twelve-week patency rates were 62.5% in the control group, 83.3% in the dexamethasone group, 100% in the Cytoxan group, and only 33.3% in the azathioprine group. The ratio of the luminal area to the area enclosed by the internal elastic lamina was used as an index of intimal hyperplasia, with a higher ratio indicating less intimal thickening. This ratio of the patient vessels was 0.74 +/- 0.14 (N = 15) for the controls, 0.79 +/- 0.11 (N = 6) for the Cytoxan group, and 0.91 +/- 0.06 (N = 5, p less than 0.05) for the dexamethasone group, which is statistically significant by means of analysis of variance. Occluded vessels had evidence of organized thrombus without any intimal hyperplasia. The decrease in intimal hyperplasia seen in the steroid group suggests a potential role for steroids in small vessel revascularization, but further studies are required.",

    "abstract": "To delineate neural, arterial, and venous components contributing to impotence, we used a previously described noninvasive screening sequence combined with stimulation of artificial erection with papaverine injection, selective pudendal arteriography (SPA), and dynamic cavernosography (DC). Among 572 men with impotence, age range 17 to 78 years (average age 54.8 years), 26 men with potential cavernosal leaks in absence of other factors were identified; 16 underwent DC; among these five had normal cavernous venous drainage. Eight men with abnormal cavernosal venous drainage required cavernous infusion flow rates higher than 120 ml/min to obtain erection and higher than 40 ml/min to maintain erection. Radiographic studies showed cavernosal leakage in all eight patients. Eight men, ages 39 to 61 years, underwent surgical ablation of abnormal cavernosal venous drainage. Among these, five men have had excellent results for up to 3 years. One failure was related to unrecognized penile arterial disease later shown by SPA. In two men small doses of papaverine now induce erection. We now recommend SPA before DC to rule out an arterial abnormality. Accurate identification of factors contributing to erectile failure is critical for successful treatment; in this experience candidates for correction of cavernosal leak syndrome were uncommon.",

    "abstract": "Between January 1978 and December 1986, 69 polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafts on the ascending aorta were placed in 53 patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the innominate and left common carotid arteries. Thirty-six patients had symptoms predominantly of amaurosis fugax, verebrobasilar ischemia, and upper limb ischemia. The remaining 17 patients had no symptoms but had severe hemodynamically significant occlusive disease. All operations were accomplished via median sternotomy. One patient died after surgery (operative mortality rate 1.9%), and one patient had minor postoperative neurologic deficit that partially improved on long-term follow-up. Patency of the reconstruction was routinely assessed by a Doppler device combining (1) a continuous wave Doppler and (2) real-time mechanical sector B-mode imaging with frequencies of 3.5 MHz and 7.5 MHz. There were two early asymptomatic occlusions; one was related to a technical error that was successfully revised and the other to low systemic perfusion. The mean follow-up time was 50.5 months. Two patients were lost to follow-up and a further six patients died, for a cumulative 5-year survival rate of 84.9%. One patient had only partial improvement in symptoms and one patient sustained a late postoperative neurologic deficit after internal carotid occlusion distal to a patent aortocarotid bypass. The remaining patients were free of symptoms. There were no infective complications. All the patients underwent late assessment by Doppler ultrasonography and B-mode scanning. One asymptomatic occlusion was thereby identified to be a result of diminished runoff. The overall secondary patency rate at 5 years was 96.1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The results of duplex ultrasound scanning for the diagnosis of stenoses in Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistulas and graft arteriovenous fistulas created for hemodialysis access are reported. Quantitative Doppler spectrum analysis of 64 arteriovenous fistulas was correlated with the outcome of digital subtraction angiography. The best Doppler parameter for the detection of a stenosis was the peak systolic frequency. In graft arteriovenous fistulas the use of this parameter resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 84% in the detection of stenoses. In Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistulas the diagnosis of anastomotic stenoses was possible with a diagnostic accuracy of 81%, a sensitivity of 79%, and a specificity of 84%. Measurement of peak systolic frequency ratios or end-diastolic frequencies had no additional diagnostic value for the detection of stenoses. The diagnosis of efferent vein stenoses was very accurate with duplex investigation (accuracy 96%, sensitivity 95%, and a specificity of 97%. We conclude that duplex scanning is a promising noninvasive method for the diagnosis of stenoses in arteriovenous fistulas created for hemodialysis access.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic bypass grafts placed to the distal lower extremity often fail because of an occlusive tissue response in the perianastomotic region. The origin of the cells that comprise this occlusive lesion and the causes of the cellular proliferation are not known. To increase our understanding of this process we cultured cells from hyperplastic lesions obtained from patients at the time of reexploration for lower extremity graft failure, and we studied their identity and growth factor production in tissue culture. These cultures contain cells that express muscle-specific actin isoforms, shown by immunohistochemical staining, consistent with vascular smooth muscle origin. These cultures also released material that stimulated smooth muscle cell growth. A portion of this activity was similar to platelet-derived growth factor, since preincubation with antibody-to-human platelet-derived growth factor partially blocked the mitogenic effect of medium conditioned by human anastomotic hyperplastic cells. These conditioned media also contained material that competed with platelet-derived growth factor for its receptor, as measured in a radioreceptor assay. Northern blot analysis showed that these cells contain messenger RNA that encodes the A chain but not the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor. In addition, these cells contain messenger RNA that encodes a platelet-derived growth factor receptor. We conclude that cultured smooth muscle cells from human anastomotic hyperplastic lesions express genes for platelet-derived growth factor A chain and a platelet-derived growth factor receptor and secrete biologically active molecules similar to platelet-derived growth factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to explain the failure of first clinical trials of autologous endothelial seeding in smokers, the initial reproductive capacity of saphenous vein endothelial cells from smokers and nonsmokers was studied by a replicate microwell technique. Endothelial cells were enzymatically harvested from saphenous vein segments of patients with coronary bypasses (21 smokers and 18 nonsmokers). After 15 minutes (group A) and 7 minutes (group B) of collagenase exposure, the endothelial cell harvest from donors who smoked was 41% (p less than 0.02) lower for group A and 30% (p less than 0.2) lower for group B than that from nonsmokers. In analogy, the viable cell yield was 32% (p less than 0.04) and 29% (p less than 0.05) lower for groups A and B, respectively, in cultures from donors who smoked. Daily cell counts over an ensuing 10-day period also revealed a significant difference in the proliferative behavior of endothelial cells from smokers and nonsmokers. Whereas endothelial cells from nonsmokers regularly entered the exponential phase of proliferation on day 4.4 +/- 1.8 (group A) and day 4.6 +/- 1.3 (group B), endothelial cells from smokers reached the logarithmic growth phase either with delay (day 6.8 +/- 2.1, group A) or remained completely quiescent (group B). Lower harvest efficiency and suppressed reproductive capacity of endothelial cells in smokers--on top of an already critically low inoculum in single-staged endothelial cell seeding--might explain the failure of initial clinical trials.",

According to a survey of the English-language medical literature this was the fourth such patient successfully treated. C. fetus sepsis associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm was first reported in 1971. The first patient to survive reconstruction of an aortic tube graft aneurysm infected with C. fetus was reported in 1983. Because the natural history of an aneurysm infected by C. fetus appears to be rapid progression to rupture, patients should be operated on promptly. All patients reported in the literature who were operated on before rupture survived. Survival was independent of the type of reconstruction. When the aneurysm ruptured all patients died. Whereas extraanatomic bypass is generally considered the procedure of choice for an infected abdominal aneurysm, the aneurysms of our patient and three other patients cited in the literature were reconstructed with anatomically placed prosthetic grafts. In the absence of other contraindications such as a grossly evident purulent infection, an abdominal aortic aneurysm infected by C. fetus may represent a subset of infected aneurysms that can be treated successfully with an anatomically placed prosthetic graft and antibiotics.",

Preoperative arteriography revealed a solitary lesion in 42 of 148 legs (28%) examined, and a combined lesion was found in the remaining 106 legs (72%). Incapacitating intermittent claudication, rest pain, tissue loss, or a combination of these was an indication for laser arterial reconstruction. None of the argon laser-treated lesions was treated with balloon dilatation, but since March 1988 all appropriate YAG laser-treated lesions were immediately followed by laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. The lesions in 64 of 89 legs (72%) treated by argon and 42 of 59 (71%) treated by YAG were successfully recanalized. However, successful angioplasty was performed in 44 of 89 (49%) and 34 of 59 (58%) lesions, respectively. The recanalization depended on the type of lesion (tight stenosis vs occlusion) and the length of lesion (localized vs total-length occlusion). However, the success rate of recanalization was almost the same as the success rate when both laser systems were used. Argon laser treatment proved successful in 19 of 20 (95%) segmental occlusions in popliteal arteries, whereas YAG laser treatment proved successful in four of five (80%) short segmental (less than 15 cm) occlusions of superficial femoral arteries and in 16 of 23 (70%) long segmental (greater than or equal to 15 cm) occlusions of superficial femoral arteries. In 26 of 36 (72%) total-length occlusions of superficial femoral and popliteal arteries, recanalization was not possible (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Prophylactic closed suction drainage has been advocated in a variety of surgical wounds, but its use in wounds involving vascular anastomoses has not been studied. Fifty patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization that required bilateral groin incisions were randomly assigned to have either the right or left side of the groin drained with a closed suction catheter. The contralateral wound was closed without drainage. Statistically there was no difference between wound closed with drains and undrained wounds in the occurrence of hematomas, seromas, lymphoceles, superficial infections, subcutaneous infections, or graft infections; although serious complications were more frequent in the drained wounds. Prophylactic closed suction drainage appears to offer no advantage over closure without drainage in wounds of the groin resulting from elective vascular operations.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous laser probe \"hot tip\" angioplasty procedures were performed on 47 occluded femoropopliteal artery segments in 27 men and 10 women ranging in age from 31 to 92 (mean, 64.7) years. Indications for the procedure included claudication in 29 (78%) segments, and the occlusion lased was greater than 7 cm in length in 51% of the procedures. Failure to recanalize the occlusion occurred in 14 (30%) segments, and recanalization followed by in-hospital reocclusion occurred in seven (15%) segments, yielding an initial failure rate of 45%. Initial failures were noted in 40% of the less than 3 cm occlusions, 33% of the 4 to 7 cm occlusions, and 54% of the greater than 7 cm occlusions. In nine (43%) instances in these 21 failures there was extension of the occluded segment or decline of the ankle/brachial index or both, precipitating the need for surgery in three (18%) of these 17 patients. Among the successfully treated group, 17 (65%) of these vessels in 15 patients reoccluded from 1 to 14 (mean, 3 1/2) months after the procedure. Cumulative patency among the successfully lased vessels was 69% at 1-month, 38% at 6 months', 29% at 12 months', and 14% at 15 months' follow-up. Fifteen-month patency was 7% of the entire series of 47 vessels treated. Eighteen complications occurred after 15 (32%) of these 47 procedures. Based on these results, the widespread application of laser probe angioplasty cannot be justified without further clinical and laboratory investigation.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective review was undertaken of 127 lower extremity fasciotomies performed for compartment syndrome after acute ischemia and revascularization in 73 patients with vascular trauma and 49 patients with arterial occlusive disease. One hundred twelve (88%) fasciotomies were performed early (at the time revascularization); 15 (12%) were delayed because of late compartment syndrome diagnosis. Ninety-four (77%) patients had more than one accepted indication for fasciotomy. Double-incision fasciotomy was used in 98 (77%) extremities, single-incision fasciotomy was used in 19 (15%), and fasciotomy-fibulectomy was used in 10 (8%). Fasciotomies were closed in 88 (69%) patients an average of 14 days after surgery. Seven patients needed multiple skin grafting procedures or myocutaneous flaps to close the wound; none compromised limb salvage. Five other patients had minor wound infections that resolved. Functional status returned to preoperative levels by the time of discharge from the hospital in 59 (48%) patients. Thirty-one (24%) patients had residual lower extremity disability related to delayed union of the fracture (five), chronic neuropathy (20), leg swelling (one), or ischemic nonhealing fasciotomy wounds (three); two patients had unrelated disabilities. Fourteen (11%) amputations were required for refractory limb ischemia; two (1.6%) were required for wet gangrene of the foot, which infected the fasciotomy site; the others had open noninfected incisions. Eighteen (15%) patients died of cardiopulmonary failure or multisystem failure or both, without fasciotomy-related problems. Open fasciotomy for compartment syndrome after acute lower extremity ischemia and revascularization was associated with an increased risk of minor wound morbidity. However, limb loss and death resulted from persistent ischemia and underlying systemic disease processes or injuries, but not from open fasciotomy wound complications.",

    "abstract": "Arterial walls tend to adapt to maintain a specific wall shear stress. The formation of neointimal hyperplasia and endothelial cell healing of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts may also be governed by wall shear stress, which suggests that an optimal graft diameter may exist. To test this, 40 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts with internal diameters of 3, 6, and 8 mm were inserted end to end in the femoral and carotid arteries of 10 mongrel dogs. Total flow and diameter were measured, and grafts were stained with Evans blue dye, fixed by pressure perfusion, and analyzed by computer for anastomotic neointimal thickening, graft pseudointimal thickening, and degree of endothelial coverage. Mean calculated shear stress was 41 dyne/cm2 for the 3 mm grafts, 7 dyne/cm2 for the 6 mm grafts, and 3 dyne/cm2 for the 8 mm grafts. Fifteen weeks later the patency rate was 0 of 10 for the 3 mm grafts, 16 of 20 for the 6 mm grafts, and 7 of 10 for the 8 mm grafts. The mean graft shear stress was calculated to be 10 dyne/cm2 for the 6 mm grafts and 4 dyne/cm2 for the 8 mm grafts. Pseudointima lining the graft was composed of disorganized protein and cell remnants. The rough surface contained no overlying endothelium. Anastomotic neointima contained a layer of well-organized smooth muscle cells covered by a single layer of polygonal-shaped endothelial cells. A transition zone of thrombus, which is sandwiched by a wedge of smooth muscle cells near the graft surface and covered by endothelial cells, is described. Mean thickness of pseudointima of the patent 8 mm grafts was 150 microns thicker than that of the 6 mm grafts. Anastomotic neointimal thickness was 110 microns thicker in the 8 mm grafts compared with the 6 mm grafts. Among the 6 mm grafts, the carotid grafts had an average initial shear stress of 10 dyne/cm2, whereas the femoral grafts averaged a lower 5 dyne/cm2 and yielded pseudointima and neointima that were 40 microns thicker. The percent graft surface area covered with neointima did not differ among the grafts of differing diameter either proximally or distally. Lower shear stresses produced greater amounts of pseudointimal thickening within polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and neointimal thickening at their anastomoses. Conversely, the high shear stress from small-diameter grafts was associated with poor graft patency. These results suggest that an optimal graft diameter may help to prevent neointimal hyperplasia and graft thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine in peripheral arteries whether the endothelium plays a protective role against aggregating platelets and whether the responses to platelets are altered by hypercholesterolemia. Male Yorkshire pigs were fed either a normal diet or a 2% high-cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In isolated iliac arteries from control animals, aggregating platelets caused contractions that were significantly inhibited by the endothelium. In rings with endothelium from pigs fed a cholesterol diet, the contractions were augmented and no difference was noted between rings with and rings without endothelium. In rings taken from control pigs contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, aggregating platelets caused endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were attenuated by blockade of adenosine diphosphate or serotonin. Adenosine diphosphate and serotonin also caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. In arteries from cholesterol-fed animals, the inhibitory effects of the endothelium to aggregating platelets, adenosine diphosphate, and serotonin were impaired. These experiments indicate that in porcine iliac arteries the endothelium exerts inhibitory effects on the responses to aggregating platelets, which are mediated by adenosine diphosphate and serotonin released from platelets. Hypercholesterolemia impairs the endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets caused by reduced relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and serotonin and unmasks the contractions evoked by aggregating platelets. This may increase the level of vascular tone, decrease blood flow and increase platelet aggregation, and eventually facilitate the occurrence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Confirmation of the diagnosis of lymphedema often requires lymphangiography, a procedure that is painful for the patient and technically demanding. Radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy is a relatively new technique that uses technetium 99 m antimony trisulfide colloid to produce a diagnostic image similar to a lymphangiogram. The procedure requires a single subcutaneous injection in the involved extremity, and images are obtained 3 hours later. It is technically easy to perform, produces minimal discomfort for the patient, and has no adverse effects. We have recently used radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy to evaluate 17 patients with extremity edema. These patients initially had a presumed diagnosis of lymphedema involving the upper or lower extremity. Lymphoscintigraphy confirmed the diagnosis of lymphedema in 12 (70.6%) patients. In five of the 17 patients (29.4%) the clinical impression of lymphedema was not supported by lymphoscintigraphy, leading to alternative diagnoses such as lipomatosis, venous insufficiency (two patients), congestive heart failure, and disuse edema. In all patients with secondary lymphedema the lymphatic system in the involved extremity could be partially visualized. Conversely, three of four patients with primary lymphedema had no ascent of the tracer from the foot and no lymphatic channels could be visualized. Lymphoscintigraphy is relatively easy to perform, safe, minimally invasive, and not uncomfortable for the patient. It is useful in differentiating lymphedema from other causes of extremity edema, allowing institution of appropriate therapy.",

    "abstract": "Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts have been used extensively for infrainguinal vascular reconstruction either as the conduit of choice or as a substitute when saphenous vein is unavailable. Although numerous studies have shown satisfactory early patency rates, the long-term efficacy of these grafts in a large number of patients for specific indications and in various positions has been less well defined. From 1977 to 1987 we used four PTFE grafts from three different manufacturers to perform 300 infrainguinal reconstructions on 240 patients on our vascular service. The indications for surgery were disabling claudication in 28% and limb salvage in 72%. The 30-day operative mortality of 1% was not different from the 1.4% associated with infrainguinal autogenous vein grafting. The 5-year cumulative patency rate achieved with all infrainguinal polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was 35%, significantly higher for grafts placed for claudication (57%) than those placed for limb salvage (24%). There were no significant differences between the above-knee and below-knee locations for distal anastomoses regardless of indication, but femoropopliteal grafts provided significantly higher 5-year patency (37%) than infrapopliteal grafts (12%). Comparison of the 5-year patency rates among the three manufacturers of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts showed no significant differences. Fifty-four polytetrafluoroethylene grafts that failed underwent 67 revisions after catheter thrombectomy or thrombolysis, which resulted in a minimal 11% 5-year patency rate. Based on this experience, it is concluded that infrainguinal polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses provide significantly inferior results when compared with autogenous reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "In the last 12 years we have performed 55 axillopopliteal bypass graftings with 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for limb salvage in 50 patients who were at high risk for limb loss. Indications for this procedure were (1) severe atherosclerotic disease of the common, superficial, and deep femoral arteries (33 cases); (2) failed aortofemoral bypass grafting with sufficient fibrosis or disease progression in the deep femoral artery (five cases); (3) insufficient hemodynamic and clinical improvement after axillofemoral bypass grafting (10 cases); and (4) sepsis in the groin from a previously infected graft (seven cases). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 8%, and the 5-year cumulative patient survival rate was 40%. Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative primary graft patency rates were 58%, 45%, and 40%, respectively. Comparable limb salvage rates were 83%, 68%, and 58%. Repeat operations increased 5-year patency rates from 40% to 59% (p less than 0.05). Three-year patency rate for grafts placed in the presence of poor angiographic runoff in one vessel was 62% and for good angiographic runoff (two to three vessels) it was 57% (NS). Grafts to the above-knee popliteal artery had a patency rate of 67% at 3 years, whereas for grafts that crossed the knee joint it was 51% (NS). Three-year patency rate for 24 straight axillopopliteal grafts was 42%, and for 31 sequential axillofemoral-popliteal grafts it was 74% (p less than 0.05). These results show that axillopopliteal bypass grafting is justified when other standard operations are not possible in patients who are in imminent danger of limb loss, and that every possible effort should be made to use the common or deep femoral artery as part of a sequential axillofemoral-popliteal procedure.",

Two years later he was referred to Duke University Medical Center after he experienced a thromboembolic event in his left upper extremity. A CT scan and angiogram of the chest showed a large false aneurysm located 5 cm from the origin of the left common carotid artery and filling the anterior mediastinum. Additional history was obtained of multiple stab wounds to the left side of the chest 7 years before admission. The aneurysm was treated with sequential saphenous vein bypass grafting of right common carotid to left common carotid to left subclavian artery, followed by aneurysm thrombosis induced with wire coils. The differential diagnosis of a chest mass should include aneurysms of the great vessels.",

    "abstract": "From 1977 through 1988, 16 patients underwent carotid artery resection and reconstruction or simple ligation in the treatment of advanced cervical carcinomas. Three patients underwent carotid artery ligation, with postoperative transient ischemic attacks, which resolved, in one patient. In the remaining 13 patients, interposition saphenous vein grafts were used to reconstruct the resected carotid arteries. In one of these 13 patients, the previously unresected carotid artery ruptured and was treated by carotid artery resection with interposition vein grafting and coverage by a myocutaneous flap. There were two immediate postoperative strokes, with excellent neurologic recovery in one, and one late postoperative stroke (6 months). There was one postoperative death. Adjunctive intraoperative irradiation (1500 to 2000 rad) was employed in 15 patients to decrease the risk of recurrent disease. Since 1982, pectoralis major muscle flaps have been constructed in all patients to cover the vein grafts, with no subsequent carotid artery blowouts. Seven patients are free of cancer more than 1 year after surgery. In conclusion, carotid artery resection for the treatment of advanced cervical carcinomas may be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates in carefully selected cases. Coverage of the vein graft by a myocutaneous flap appears to protect against carotid artery blowout. Intraoperative irradiation appears to decrease significantly the local recurrence rate of these aggressive tumors.",

    "abstract": "This article summarizes our experience with the operative management of renovascular hypertension in a contemporary population of elderly patients. During a recent 18-month period 35 of 74 patients (47%) undergoing an operation for renovascular hypertension at our center were in their seventh (21 patients) or eighth (14 patients) decade of life (mean age, 68 years). There were 17 men and 18 women with blood pressures ranging from 176/90 mm Hg to 280/215 mm Hg (mean, 213/121 mm Hg). Twenty-seven patients (77%) had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.3 mg/dl). Nineteen patients had severe insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl), with five of these patients being dependent on dialysis. Thirty-three of 35 patients (94%) had evidence of organ-specific atherosclerotic damage as manifested by cardiac disease (72%), cerebrovascular disease (37%), or renal insufficiency (77%). Operative management consisted of unilateral revascularization in 17 patients (includes three contralateral nephrectomies), bilateral renal revascularization in 17 patients, and primary nephrectomy in one. Simultaneous aortic replacement was performed in nine patients. There were two operative deaths (5.7%) and two postoperative graft thromboses (4%). Hypertension was cured (three) or improved (27) in 30 of the 33 survivors (91%). Renal function was improved in six and worsened in two patients with severe non-dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency. Three of five patients who were dependent on dialysis before surgery were removed from dialysis after renal revascularization. On follow-up (mean, 10.3 months) we found that five patients had died. This article emphasizes the complexity of atherosclerosis in the current population presenting for operative management of renovascular hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of 18 arterial and six venous injuries, 65% were penetrating and 35% were blunt injuries. Eighty percent of all patients had significant associated injuries that required repair. Angiography was performed in 13 of 20 patients, with four performed during surgery. Repair methods were ligation in two of six venous injuries and three of 18 arterial injuries, primary repair in three of six venous injuries and six of 18 arterial injuries, and autogenous saphenous vein graft in seven of 18 arterial injuries. Exploration and debridement, thrombectomy, and nonoperative management were used in one arterial injury each. Fasciotomy was employed in six of 13 arterial injuries in the extremities. There was one operative death, no reoperations, and no early or late amputations. Mean follow-up of 27 months demonstrated normal palpable and Doppler pulses (by noninvasive testing) distal to all arterial repairs. This study supports an aggressive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of noniatrogenic pediatric vascular trauma, emphasizing the liberal use of fasciotomy and meticulous vascular repair for the successful management of these challenging injuries.",

Four cases are presented in which persistent retroperitoneal lymphoceles were discovered 2 to 8 years after surgery. Reexploration of the groin and repeated aspirations of lymphatic fluid failed to control the drainage. Reexploration of the retroperitoneum documented lymphatic injury, which was controlled by ligation of the lymphatics with suture. A review of the literature discloses five similar reported cases of retroperitoneal lymphocele and 12 cases of chylous ascites after abdominal aortic surgery. Clearly, avoiding lymphatic injury or immediate repair of any lymphatic injuries will prevent this problem. Once a persistent lymphocele has developed, aspiration will establish the diagnosis. Our experience would suggest that reexploration of the retroperitoneum is required to control the drainage and to prevent possible graft infection.",

    "abstract": "The perioperative and long-term survival of patients who undergo resection of abdominal aortic aneurysm is often determined by coexisting cardiac disease. This study evaluates the influence of left ventricular ejection fraction on both perioperative and long-term morbidity and mortality. Preoperative ejection fraction was measured in 104 of 208 patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Nineteen patients were found to have ejection fractions less than 0.35, and this group was compared to 85 patients with ejection fractions greater than 0.35. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, sex, preoperative renal function, or smoking status. The groups were significantly different with respect to the prevalence of prior myocardial infarction (79% of the low ejection fraction group vs 31% of the high ejection fraction group) and symptoms equivalent to New York Heart Association class II or greater (47% of the low ejection fraction group vs 24% of the high ejection fraction group) but not prior myocardial revascularization procedure (42% of the low ejection fraction group vs 31% of the high ejection fraction group). Surgical factors including aneurysm size, duration of aortic cross-clamping, and extent of arterial replacement did not differ significantly between the two groups. The perioperative mortality was not significantly different (low ejection fraction, 5%; high ejection fraction, 2%). The cumulative life-table survival of the two groups was not statistically different. Two patients in the low ejection fraction group died in the follow-up period, yielding a 4-year actuarial survival of 0.74. This is compared to 10 deaths and actuarial survival of 0.63 (p = NS) in the high ejection fraction group. We conclude that patients should not be denied aneurysm resection solely on the basis of left ventricular ejection fraction.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated 1525 consecutive patients who had undergone thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic surgery to ascertain the factors associated with the development of acute renal failure. Complete data were available in 1233 patients who were treated recently, and these were analyzed. Acute renal failure, severe enough to require dialysis, developed in 5.5% of this group (68/1233): 2.3% and 7%, respectively, for descending (9/391) and thoracoabdominal repairs (59/842). Of interest, on multivariate analysis, both renal artery endarterectomy for occlusive disease (p = 0.0006) and chronic dissection (p = 0.03) were associated with significantly less acute renal failure. On multivariate analysis, the significant independent predictors (p less than 0.05) of acute renal failure were preexistent renal dysfunction, evidence of diffuse atherosclerosis, the use of the pump bypass, and markers of hemodynamic instability. Contrary to earlier reports based on a smaller number of patients, we found that neither the use of pump bypass (7% acute renal failure), atriorenal bypass (8% acute renal failure), nor cold Ringer's lactate (3% acute renal failure) appeared to significantly avert the complication of acute renal failure. Indeed, pump bypass appeared to be deleterious (p = 0.0146) and perfusion with cold Ringer's lactate was not without risk. Furthermore, in a prospective evaluation of angiotensin converting enzyme blockers, we were unable to show that they afforded renal protection after transient renal ischemia.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the effect of cyclic tension on prostacyclin secretion by venous and arterial endothelial cells. Early passage endothelial cells from bovine aortas and venae cavae were subjected to cyclic deformation (up to 17% elongation and 60 cycles/min). On posttreatment days 3 and 5 a radioimmunoassay was used to assess supernatant fluids from the endothelial cells for prostacyclin activity. The results indicate that in vitro (1) under static or control conditions, venous endothelial cells secrete significantly more prostacyclin (an increase of 1.5- and 4.8-fold on days 3 and 5, respectively) than do arterial endothelial cells isolated from the same animal and (2) prostacyclin secretion by mechanically deformed venous and arterial endothelial cells was significantly less than static control cultures on days 3 and 5. However, prostaglandin I2 secretion remained at higher levels in cyclically deformed venous endothelial cells than in cyclically deformed arterial endothelial cells. These data suggest that endothelial cells from the vena cava have a greater capacity for prostacyclin secretion than have their aortic counterparts. If these observations are maintained in vivo, greater prostacyclin secretion by venous endothelial cells could represent a homeostatic mechanism aimed at reducing thrombus formation in low-velocity areas of the vasculature.",

    "abstract": "We measured ankle/arm pressure indexes and blood flow rates before and after performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 36 extremities. Flow rates through the leg were determined with a magnetic resonance blood flow scanner. All patients had claudication; one had gangrene, another had an ulcer, and two complained of rest pain. The median age was 65 years, and 72% were men. There were 25 dilations of the iliac artery, 12 of the superficial femoral artery, and eight of the popliteal arteries; nine patients had two arterial segments dilated. Nineteen legs had ankle/arm pressure indexes before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of less than 0.80 (range 0.51 to 0.75); their flow rates averaged 40 +/- 20 (SD) ml/min. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty flow and pressure increased significantly in 14 of these 19 legs, and three had no hemodynamic improvement; in one leg only pressure and in another only flow increased significantly. The remaining 17 extremities had ankle/arm pressure indexes before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ranging from 0.81 to 1.09; their flow rates averaged 53 +/- 27 (SD) ml/min. Abnormal flow rates were detected in 15 of these 17 extremities. With near-normal ankle/arm pressure indexes no significant increase in pressure was anticipated. Flow rates augmented to 75 +/- 28 (SD) ml/min after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; a significant increase in flow was noted in 12 legs (71%). For patients with ankle/arm indexes before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of less than 0.80, either pressure or flow measurements should corroborate the benefits of the operation, whereas if the ankle arm index is greater than 0.80, flow measurements are most likely to substantiate changes in peripheral hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is a safe and effective arterial contrast agent that images arteries by displacing blood. The use of CO2 gas to displace blood during angioscopy may improve intraoperative angioscopy and allow percutaneous angioscopy. To study this, 46 angioscopic evaluations in the femoral arteries of four dogs were done without inflow occlusion. The ability of CO2 gas to clear the flowing blood was compared to a high-pressure infusion of saline solution. Carbon dioxide gas successfully displaced flowing blood in 20 of 25 evaluations (80%) as compared to three of 21 evaluations (14%) with infusion of saline solution (p less than 0.0001). After the CO2 gas infusion was stopped, the image remained clear for 9 +/- 1 seconds. When saline was used, the image was clear only as long as the infusion was continued. The quality of clear images for the two media were similar through the eyepiece of the angioscope, but images observed through the motion picture camera had better contrast and depth of field in CO2 gas. The use of a CO2 gas infusion can clear the field of flowing blood without the risk of volume overloading and potentially allow performance of a successful percutaneous angioscopy.",

Causes of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism included the postoperative state (33%), cancer (32%), and stroke (11%). There were 93 females and 98 males; ages ranged from 17 to 90 years (average, 57 years). Indications for placement of the Hunter-Sessions balloon were as follows: contraindication to anticoagulants (33%), anticoagulant complications (24%), pulmonary embolism despite anticoagulants (45%), and others including inferior vena cava thrombus (12%). Sixty-eight percent had clinical phlebitis and 36% had positive venography results. Pulmonary embolism had occurred in 165 patients (86%). It was diagnosed by ventilation-perfusion scanning (75%), angiography (23%), or on clinical grounds (2%) in patients with confirmed deep venous thrombosis. At the time of the procedure 52% were in significant cardiopulmonary distress, and 10% were intubated and on respirators. Transjugular placement was done in 188 patients, and transfemoral placement was performed in three. All All tolerated inferior vena cava interruption. Thirty patients (15%) died while in the hospital an average of 21 days after balloon placement, which was unrelated to the deaths. Follow-up was 45 months. Ninety-four patients are dead, 95 are alive, and the status of two patients is unknown. Twenty-nine of 64 patients (45%) who died after they left the hospital died of cancer. At last follow-up, 75% of patients had legs free of edema and 25% had need for elastic stockings. No malfunction or migration has occurred with the device. No patient had a pulmonary embolism while in the hospital after insertion of the Hunter-Sessions balloon, and no patient died of pulmonary embolism. Late minor pulmonary embolism occurred in three patients.",

    "abstract": "To determine the influence of angiographically identifiable intracranial vascular lesions on the outcome of carotid endarterectomy, 597 patients from our carotid surgery registry who had had complete angiographic evaluation were divided into two groups: (1) significant intracranial disease identified by angiography (N = 134) and no significant intracranial disease identified by angiography (N = 463). The short- and long-term outcomes of carotid endarterectomy in the two groups were compared. Perioperative stroke morbidity (intracranial disease 1.9%, no intracranial disease 1.8%) and mortality (intracranial disease 0.5%, no intracranial disease 0.7%) were acceptable and not statistically different (p greater than 0.7). Late stroke prevention was nearly identical in the two groups, with 3-, 5-, and 10-year life-table of stroke-free rates of 93%, 87%, and 79%, respectively, versus 92%, 90%, and 85%, respectively, in the intracranial disease and no intracranial disease groups (p = 0.75). The incidence of recurrent transient ischemic attack was 9.7% in the intracranial disease group and 6.5% in the no intracranial disease group (p = 0.22). In the clinical population studied in the described method, angiographically identifiable intracranial vascular disease did not appear to have a statistically demonstrable influence on the short-term or long-term prognosis after carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Progressive peripheral atherosclerosis commonly leads to failure of a bypass graft. Lowering blood cholesterol retards coronary atherosclerosis and similar treatment might limit peripheral atherosclerosis. To identify lipid risk factors for peripheral atherosclerosis, 144 patients with peripheral atherosclerosis (98 with severe disease and 46 with stable claudication) and 61 age-matched control subjects were studied. Fasting lipid (cholesterol and triglycerides) and lipoprotein (high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL] cholesterol [C]) levels were measured. The incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, amount of previous tobacco use, and location and severity of the peripheral atherosclerosis were also determined. Patients with peripheral atherosclerosis had higher VLDL-C and lower HDL-C levels than controls had, but serum cholesterol and plasma LDL-C levels were similar. Patients with peripheral atherosclerosis also had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Predictors of peripheral atherosclerosis by regression analysis were diabetes mellitus, low HDL-C levels, and tobacco use, with diabetes mellitus being the strongest variable. Peripheral atherosclerosis below the inguinal ligament was strongly predicted by low HDL-C and increased VLDL-C levels but not by increased cholesterol or LDL-C levels. Thus lipid risk factors for peripheral atherosclerosis are different, and attempts at limiting late graft failure by lowering lipid levels should be directed toward these lipoproteins.",

    "abstract": "Between August 1983 and December 1987, 23 patients received a 30-minute intraoperative, intraarterial infusion of streptokinase (seven patients) or urokinase (16 patients) because of residual thrombus or persistent ischemia or both after thromboembolectomy. Ages ranged from 21 to 77 years (mean, 58 years). In 15 patients intraoperative lytic therapy was part of the initial operation, whereas in eight patients intraoperative lytic therapy was performed during a secondary operation to treat thrombosis of a recently placed graft. Seven patients in the latter group had hypercoagulable conditions (five had heparin-induced thrombosis; one had protein C deficiency; one had polycythemia with thrombocytosis). Improvement after intraoperative lytic therapy was seen on angiography performed after infusion in 13 of 17 (76%) patients in whom angiography was performed both before and after intraoperative lytic therapy. Grafts in 12 of these patients remained patent without additional intervention, and in one graft thrombus formed again. In contrast, among four patients without angiographic evidence of improvement, thrombus formed again in four grafts (p less than 0.004). Intraoperative lytic therapy was considered successful in 74% of instances (17/23), including four of seven patients with hypercoagulable states. Three of six patients whose grafts failed had major amputations, whereas there were no amputations after successful infusions. Twelve patients were heparinized after intraoperative lytic therapy. Ten patients in this group were considered treatment successes, and two were considered treatment failures. Three of 11 patients not heparinized after intraoperative lytic therapy were considered treatment failures. Four hematomas occurred in the former group and none in the latter (p less than 0.03). No hematomas occurred in the heparin-induced thrombosis group in spite of anticoagulation with sodium warfarin (Coumadin). Only one hematoma occurred within 6 hours of intraoperative lytic therapy, and thus it was attributable to the infusion. We conclude that intraoperative lytic therapy is an effective adjunct to manage residual thrombus or persistent ischemia or both after lower extremity revascularization. Postinfusion angiography is of prognostic value. Heparinization after intraoperative lytic therapy seems beneficial but significantly increases the risk of bleeding complications.",

    "abstract": "In 96 consecutive patients undergoing primary femoropopliteal bypass grafting, the runoff was evaluated with a new grading system, based on findings at intraoperative postreconstruction serial angiography. This concept, which takes foot vessel involvement into account in patients with only one patent crural artery, is a modification of the traditional method of runoff assessment. Good runoff was defined as patency of two or three lower leg arteries to the foot or one patent, vessel continuous with intact anterior or posterior foot arch. In limbs with no patent vessel or one patent vessel with deficient or occluded foot arches, the runoff was classified as poor. The cumulative primary patency rates at 12 months in groups with good and poor runoff were 81% and 37%, respectively. The predictive value of the new method was superior to that of other comparable methods (traditional method, Society for Vascular Surgery and International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery criteria, and modified Society for Vascular Surgery and International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery criteria). This improved prediction can be ascribed to the optimal angiographic technique for visualizing distal vessels, selective evaluation of foot vessel runoff with a new concept, and the criteria used to define good and poor runoff.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the role of hemodynamic factors on low-density lipoprotein transport and metabolism in the intact arterial wall. Freshly excised canine carotid blood vessels were exposed to well-defined pulsatile flow in vitro for continuous periods up to 20 hours. We chose to impose the following hemodynamic conditions on our test carotid arteries: normotension, hypertension (at physiologic flow conditions), and hypertension coupled with elevated flow of canine serum perfusate. In several experiments the effect of endothelial denudation was examined in carotid arteries exposed to normotensive pulsatile flow. A trapped ligand method was used for quantitating low-density lipoprotein uptake and metabolism in the arterial wall. The distribution of both intact and degraded low-density lipoprotein fractions was determined from measurements of radiolabelled low-density lipoprotein activity within thin radial sections of perfused arteries. Our results suggest that both hypertensive hemodynamic simulations exacerbate the uptake of low-density lipoprotein within the arterial wall (by a factor of three to nine). The percentage of low-density lipoprotein that undergoes irreversible degradation falls from 41% under normotensive conditions to below 30% when hypertensive conditions are imposed, indicating that degradative processes are not proportionally elevated with the accelerated influx. A similar pattern is observed for deendothelialized vessels.",

All patients had noncardiac limitations precluding performance of an adequate exercise stress test. Before atrial pacing all were considered to be at low risk of a postoperative cardiac event based on assessment of clinical parameters. Vascular surgery was subsequently performed in 47 patients. In these patients, pacing-induced ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm occurred in 18, a fixed perfusion defect occurred in 11, and a reversible defect occurred in six. Two of the six patients with reversible perfusion defects had preoperative coronary angiography; both had significant coronary artery disease (one or more lesions greater than or equal to 50%). Two patients (one of whom had a reversible perfusion defect) underwent preoperative coronary revascularization and tolerated subsequent vascular surgery well. All other patients received only medical therapy. None of the 47 patients undergoing vascular surgery had a postoperative cardiac event (unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death). Of the 14 patients in whom vascular surgery was deferred or canceled, surgery was canceled for noncardiac reasons in seven. Six of these seven patients had a normal perfusion scan; none had a reversible perfusion defect or marked (greater than or equal to 2 mm) ST segment depression. No cardiac event occurred during a 3-month period after atrial pacing in any of these patients. Six of the remaining seven patients had reversible perfusion defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The concept of autologous endothelial cell seeding has proved successful in animal models with respect to decrease of graft thrombogenicity and increase in patency. In the present study, application of this method in humans was explored. In 23 patients, random halves of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, used for lower limb arterial reconstructions, were seeded with endothelial cells at a seeding density of 3500 cells/cm2. These cells were derived from the saphenous vein by enzymatic harvesting. The other half was sham seeded with culture medium. Graft thrombogenicity was estimated by measuring platelet deposition on graft surface 1 and 6 months after surgery, with indium 111-labeled platelets and external gamma-camera imaging. Seeded graft segments accumulated significantly (p less than 0.03) fewer platelets at all imaging times. It is concluded that seeding of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts in humans reduces graft surface thrombogenicity. The clinical implications of this remain to be demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Deficiencies of total collagen, type III collagen, and elastin have been proposed to explain aneurysm formation. Infrarenal aortas were collected from 19 patients (age 70 +/- 7 years) undergoing operative repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (diameter 7 +/- 2 cm) and from 13 autopsies (age 63 +/- 17 years) of patients without aneurysm disease (controls). Wall thickness and collagen and elastin concentration were determined in full-thickness aorta. Collagen types I and III were measured after digestion with cyanogen bromide, which solubilized nearly 90% of total collagen for typing. Cyanogen bromide peptides were separated by sequential carboxymethylcellulose and agarose chromatography and quantified by peak area measurement with computerized image analysis. Histologic examination revealed prominent inflammatory cell infiltration and deficient, fragmented elastin in the aneurysms. Aortic wall thickness was similar in aneurysms and in control specimens. In the aneurysms, collagen was increased (37% +/- 16% vs 24% +/- 5%; p less than 0.05) and elastin was decreased (1% +/- 1% vs 12% +/- 7%; p less than 0.001), expressed as a percentage of delipidized, decalcified dry weight. Collagen type I accounted for 74% +/- 4% of aneurysm and 73% +/- 4% of control collagen solubilized for typing, and collagen type III accounted for 26% +/- 4% of aneurysm and 27% +/- 4% of control collagen solubilized for typing. Neither patients with a family history of aneurysms nor those without a history of aneurysms had collagen type III deficiency. Atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms are associated with an inflammatory process and may result from elastin degradation and not a deficiency of type III collagen.",

    "abstract": "The duration of deep venous valvular reflux was studied in 192 venous segments of the legs of 32 patients in good health. Three methods were used to elicit reflux in the supine and upright positions--Valsalva's maneuver, proximal limb compression, and release of distal limb compression. Standardized compressions were achieved with pneumatic cuffs. When this approach was used to study valve function, the time to complete closure of the valve and cessation of retrograde flow was found to be shorter than that for conventional methods of closure. The distal cuff deflation method is the only one that permits a quantitative and reproducible method to measure duration of venous reflux at all levels of the lower limb. Normal values obtained with this test are presented for the common femoral, deep femoral, and superficial femoral veins and for the popliteal and posterior tibial veins midway between knee and ankle level and the posterior tibial vein at the ankle. In the popliteal vein, median duration of reflux is 0.19 second; 95% of the values in the popliteal vein are less than 0.66 second. In distal areas, duration of reflux is short and uniform. The advantage of the cuff deflation test over the Valsalva method is that the cuff method is not hindered by the presence of ileofemoral valves. A better understanding of the relative importance of deep valve dysfunction at different levels and the expected benefit of valve repair may be obtained with this test.",

    "abstract": "Isolated aneurysms of the internal iliac artery are rare. Their anatomic location makes them true pelvic aneurysms and they may grow to a large size undetected. Their late recognition may be prompted by rupture or symptoms related to compression of neurologic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or venous structures. We have encountered three isolated hypogastric artery aneurysms with unique presentations. In one patient with bilateral isolated hypogastric artery aneurysms, one ruptured into the bladder, and at a later time the other caused ureteral obstruction. Another patient had obturator neuropathy as a result of his aneurysm. In the patient with large bilateral aneurysms, one was detected by rectal examination, and the other was found by palpation of the abdomen. The second patient with a smaller aneurysm required examination of the pelvis by CT scanning to establish the diagnosis. Awareness of the existence of these lesions is required to identify such patients who describe symptoms uncommonly associated with abdominal aneurysms. Operative management consisted of exclusion of the aneurysm and partial or complete aneurysmorrhaphy with preservation of iliac arterial flow to maintain extremity perfusion. Recovery was complete in each instance. A review of published cases is presented.",

    "abstract": "Over a 7-year period (1980 to 1987) 24 patients (18 men: mean age 67 years; range, 52 to 78 years, and six women: mean age 67 years; range, 46 to 82 years) undergoing serial carotid artery duplex scans were observed to progress to unilateral carotid artery occlusion. The occlusions were associated with ipsilateral strokes in six (25%), ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks in four (16%), and the onset of nonhemispheric symptoms in one (5%). Thirteen patients had no symptoms. Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 96 months (mean 39.4 months). Late neurologic events comprised two strokes, three transient ischemic attacks and the onset of nonhemispheric symptoms in six, which in some were disabling. Thirteen patients had no symptoms. Three deaths occurred (one was stroke related). For late events by life-table analysis, the average annual rate over the first 2 years for stroke was 10% and for transient ischemic attack 13%. The combined rate for transient ischemic attack and stroke was 20% per annum. For nonhemispheric symptoms the rate for the first year was 31%. It is concluded that unilateral carotid artery occlusion is associated with an unacceptable incidence of immediate neurologic sequelae and that such patients continue to have a high rate of late neurologic deficits at follow-up. Therefore it seems appropriate that patients who are observed to progress to high-grade stenosis and are therefore at risk for immediate occlusion should undergo prophylactic carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of chronic limb ischemia to long-term nonunion of a lower extremity fracture was suggested in a single published case report from our group 13 years ago. We have since encountered three additional patients with nonunited lower extremity fractures occurring in limbs with arterial ischemia. In each of these four patients limb revascularization was undertaken in an effort to stimulate healing of the fracture. These patients had chronic (mean 6 months) nonunion of tibial (three) or femur (one) fractures associated with severe lower extremity ischemia (ankle/brachial index m = 0.33; range 0.24 to 0.5). All patients had histories of chronic lower extremity ischemia before the fracture (ischemic rest pain, 2; claudication, 2). All patients underwent angiography followed by lower extremity revascularization. Restoration of normal arterial supply to the fracture site was followed by healing of the fracture in all patients. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported series of patients undergoing elective limb revascularization to stimulate healing of the fracture. Widespread appreciation of this relationship by orthopedic surgeons may be of considerable clinical importance.",

    "abstract": "Our experience with combined balloon catheter thrombectomy and balloon dilation for the treatment of acute thrombosis is reported. Eighteen patients underwent the combined procedures between 1981 and 1988. Primary thrombectomy and balloon dilation were performed in 14 patients, and additional reconstruction was performed in three patients. The superficial femoral artery was the site of thrombectomy and dilation in 13 patients, and the external iliac artery was the site in the remaining five patients. Successful dilation was accomplished in all patients, with stenotic sites reduced below 30% by angiography, and ankle/brachial indexes increased by 0.15 or more. No operative deaths or complications occurred. Follow-up of superficial femoral artery dilations showed a 90% patency rate continued out to 4 years and a 40% patency rate at 5 years. Combined thrombectomy and interventional catheter therapy may aid in the care of this difficult to treat vascular patient group.",

    "abstract": "We placed 20 bypass grafts to the lateral plantar artery in 18 extremities to salvage feet with wet (12) or dry (six) gangrene; 15 grafts were implanted in men (75%), and five were implanted in women (25%). The median age was 65 years. All except two patients had diabetes; eight were treated with insulin. One patient had Buerger's disease, and another had vasculitis with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. History of smoking (65%), hypertension (53%), heart disease (71%), and osteomyelitis in the foot (35%), were noted. Cultures were positive in 15 gangrenous feet, 11 with gram-negative bacilli. Four long femoroplantar bypasses were placed. Ten short grafts were placed from the popliteal artery, and six jump grafts were placed distal to a femoropopliteal or tibial bypass. Hospital stay ranged from 8 to 38 days (median 16 days), and there were two in-hospital deaths. Transmetatarsal or button toe amputations were performed in nine feet. There were two below-knee amputations, one with a patent graft, for a foot salvage rate of 89% at 2 months. In four instances the gangrenous ulcers took longer than 6 months to heal; all other wounds healed within 6 months. The primary and secondary patency rates were 85% at 1 month, and 73% at 3 months and thereafter. Four of five graft failures occurred in the two legs with repeat bypass graftings. All patients with successful revascularization are able to walk, and seven returned to work full time.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study examined microbiologic features of arterial tissue and pharmacokinetics and bioactivity of cefamandole and cefazolin in patients undergoing elective primary prosthetic aortoiliofemoral/infrainguinal reconstruction. Double-blind, randomized, perioperative prophylaxis (1 gm intravenously every 6 hours for nine doses) with cefamandole or cefazolin was administered to 47 patients. Specimens of blood serum, subcutaneous fat, thrombus, atheroma, and arterial wall were obtained for culture and minimal inhibitory concentration and drug level analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The serum half-life (hr +/- SEM) was 1.43 +/- 0.36 for cefamandole and 2.22 +/- 0.40 for cefazolin. Over the first 2 hours of surgery and for all time intervals combined, the serum concentration of cefazolin was significantly higher (p less than 0.025) than cefamandole. Irrespective of sampling time, the tissue concentration of cefazolin was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) than cefamandole. Positive arterial tissue cultures were obtained in 12 of 29 patients (41.4%) from 23 of 116 (19.8%) arterial tissue specimens. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was the predominant isolate, 64 of 93 (68.8%). Twenty-five of the 51 coagulase-negative staphylocci tested (49%) were slime-producers. During surgery, the arterial tissue concentration of cefamandole fell below the geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentration against all organisms combined, and against S. aureus (with the highest minimal inhibitory concentration of the prevalent isolates), significantly more often than the concentration of cefazolin. The data show that a significant number of primary elective aortoiliofemoral/infrainguinal reconstructions are associated with positive arterial tissue cultures, which represent a potential source of graft infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Popliteal artery entrapment can result in claudication and limb-threatening ischemia in the young adult. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively those patients with popliteal artery entrapment. To define the syndrome, the methods used in diagnosis and the type of anatomic anomaly were established for each patient. From 1977 to 1988, 12 patients were found to have popliteal artery entrapment. The average age was 27 years, with all but three patients under age 40 years. All patients complained of calf claudication, and one had acute ischemia. The ankle pulses decreased with maneuvers in 10 patients; four patients had a resting ankle/brachial index less than one. All had diminished ankle/brachial indexes when a treadmill test was performed at 4.2 mph, 10% grade, for 10 minutes. All patients had biplanar arteriography with passive dorsiflexion and active plantar flexion. All results showed abnormal extrinsic compression or occlusion of the popliteal artery. Twenty limbs were affected; eight of 12 patients (67%) had bilateral entrapment. Type IV (37%) lesions were the most common, with type II (32%) and type III (26%) following closely. One (5%) type I lesion and no type V lesions were found. This is the largest single series of patients with popliteal entrapment in the United States. A treadmill test followed by biplanar arteriography established the diagnosis in all patients. Bilateral involvement was twice that reported in previous studies. Popliteal artery entrapment should be considered in the young adult with claudication and may be seen with greater frequency in an increasingly active population.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the transcranial Doppler is a useful technique for intraoperative neuromonitoring, we prospectively used it to study 83 patients undergoing carotid end-arterectomy. A 2 MHz pulsed-wave, range-gated transcranial Doppler was positioned at the transtemporal window after induction of general anesthesia. Mean middle cerebral artery velocity, intraarterial blood pressure, end-tidal PCO2, heart rate, and a spectral array of electroencephalographic activity were recorded continuously throughout the operation. Internal carotid artery back pressure was measured routinely. On completion of the endarterectomy, duplex ultrasound examinations and arteriograms were uniformly obtained to assess technical adequacy. Forty-nine of the 83 patients (60%) had complete preoperative and intraoperative transcranial Doppler examinations. Eleven (13%) had incomplete assessments because of small or absent transtemporal windows. Twenty-three (27%) had unsuccessful monitoring because of technical difficulties, primarily because of inability to maintain probe position--with loss of mean middle cerebral artery velocity recording. In the patients with complete studies, transcranial Doppler failed to provide information that altered surgical therapy. All monitoring modalities were normal in the one patient (1.2%) who sustained an operative stroke. We conclude that at this time, transcranial Doppler has not been useful to routinely monitor the intraoperative events during carotid endarterectomy.",

Eight locations, iliac, common femoral, profunda femoris, proximal and distal superficial femoral artery, proximal and distal popliteal, and tibioperoneal trunk were scored as normal versus abnormal, greater than 50% stenosis, or occluded, and occlusions were measured in centimeters. Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy were calculated with the arteriogram as the gold standard (83% and 96%, respectively, for normal vs abnormal, 87% and 99% for 50% stenosis, and 81% and 99% for occlusions). Color flow accurately identified the presence and extent of occlusions in 48 of 51 extremities (94%) when compared to arteriography plus operative findings, since arteriography alone tended to overestimate occlusion length. It is concluded that color flow Doppler alone may be used to screen patients with peripheral vascular disease to assess candidacy for endovascular procedures without antecedent arteriography, and that arteriography alone would exclude some patients from consideration by falsely overestimating occlusion lengths.",

    "abstract": "High-grade (80% to 99% diameter reduction) asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenoses are associated with an increased neurologic event rate (transient ischemic attack, stroke, asymptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion) compared to less severe asymptomatic lesions. However, many do remain free of associated events. To determine which are most dangerous, we compared risk factors and duplex scan results in two groups with asymptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery stenoses. Group A included 31 patients with 33 unoperated high-grade lesions that remained asymptomatic for at least 12 months (mean 30 months). Group B included 25 patients with 26 initially asymptomatic lesions that subsequently were associated with a neurologic event (mean time to event 7.4 months). The groups did not differ significantly in average age, sex, aspirin use, smoking, or prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, or cardiac disease. With respect to the index high-grade lesion, there was no difference in the frequency of a greater than 50% contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis or greater than 50% ipsilateral external carotid stenosis. However, on duplex scanning, high-grade stenoses with greater than 6.5 kHz end-diastolic frequencies were more frequently associated with an event than high-grade lesions with lower end-diastolic frequency (p = 0.0004). Similarly, seven of 23 lesions (30%) with end-diastolic frequency greater than 6.0 kHz were associated with subsequent internal carotid artery occlusion compared to only one of 29 (3.5%) with end-diastolic frequency less than or equal to 6.0 kHz (p = 0.025). Analysis of internal carotid artery end-diastolic frequency may help select a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic high-grade lesions who are at greatest risk for subsequent neurologic symptoms or ICA occlusion or both.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy, safety, and effects on hemostasis and coagulation of two doses of human tissue-type plasminogen activator in patients with acute and subacute peripheral arterial occlusion were compared. Seven patients with lower extremity ischemia and one patient with upper extremity ischemia had peripheral arterial thromboses (five arteries, three grafts) confirmed by clinical history, physical examination, and angiography. The duration of occlusion ranged from 31 hours to 30 days (mean 11.9 days). Tissue-type plasminogen activator was infused via a catheter directly into the thrombus at a randomly assigned dose of 0.05 mg/kg/hr (n = 4) or 0.025 mg/kg/hr (n = 4). Thrombolysis was complete in seven patients and partial in one. Duration of infusion ranged from 1 hour to 21 hours (mean 7.4 hours). The low dose required a longer infusion than did the high dose, but they were both successful in achieving thrombolysis. The one patient with partial thrombolysis had abrupt discontinuation of infusion when extravasation through a recently endarterectomized femoral artery developed. Otherwise there were no significant complications from tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. Secondary procedures to correct underlying arterial disease were performed in five of the seven patients (71%) who had complete thrombolysis. Even at low dosages, infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator into arteries or bypass graft thrombus produced complete thrombolysis, and no major complications occurred. This allowed more systematic effects to diagnose and treat underlying arterial disease.",

Forty-six patients (47 legs) with symptomatic varicose veins have been studied while they were in the erect position. Nineteen legs had skin changes whereas the rest (28 legs) had only varicose veins with no skin changes. In 45 limbs, reflux was confined to one vein only: long saphenous vein in 28, short saphenous vein in nine, and femoropopliteal vein in eight. In one limb, reflux was found in the long saphenous, short saphenous, and femoropopliteal veins, and in another it was found in the long and short saphenous veins. In the latter two limbs the amount of reflux found in each vein was added to obtain the total reflux in the limb. In the limbs with skin changes, reflux (median +/- 90% tolerance levels) was 30 (10 to 53) ml/sec; whereas in limbs with no skin changes it was 10 (3 to 44) ml/sec. Reflux greater than 10 ml/sec was associated with a high incidence of skin changes (66%) irrespective of whether this was in the superficial or deep veins; reflux less than 10 ml/sec was not associated with skin changes.",

Results of initial phlebography from the ankle to the femoral area were normal. No iliac vein anatomy was seen. This led to a group of tests directed toward neuromuscular function, which were unrewarding. On referral to our institution a noninvasive venous vascular laboratory examination was performed, which clearly indicated iliac vein obstruction/stenosis, with a normally patent distal venous system. Subsequent repeat phlebography, including direct femoral vein injection, visualized a mass lesion partially occluding the iliac vein. This lesion was treated with primary excision and segmental venous replacement with an interposition graft of autogeneous internal jugular vein. The excised lesion proved to be an epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the iliac vein.",

    "abstract": "This is a report by an ad hoc committee to the Joint Council of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (North American Chapter) concerning guidelines that hospitals may use or modify when judging individual applicants for hospital and operating room privileges in vascular surgery. The committee recognizes that the completion of training and obtaining a board certificate is testimony to the qualification but not necessarily the competence of an individual to practice vascular surgery. This report identifies three categories of applicant for privileges in vascular surgery; the surgeon who just completed training, the surgeon who completed training after 1984, and the surgeon who completed training before 1984. In addition, the committee recognizes the importance of periodic vascular surgery privileges renewal for established surgeons. Several pathways are defined for use by hospital privilege committees to evaluate the competence of an individual to be granted privileges in general vascular surgery. The ad hoc committee also has outlined a program for evaluation of established surgeons for renewing privileges in vascular surgery using a mechanism of case outcome audit. Finally, a review mechanism, potential corrective actions, and an appeals mechanism are also suggested. This report represents optimal criteria that may require modification by individual hospitals to meet local community needs and standards. It is the hope of the ad hoc committee that this report will help hospitals and practicing physicians improve the quality of care and treatment outcome in patients with vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of carotid endarterectomy is dependent on the inherent ability of the operation to prevent stroke as well as the incidence of restenosis and associated symptoms. To examine the long-term effects of restenosis, 301 patients having carotid endarterectomy were followed by serial duplex scanning for an average of 4 years. Carotid restenosis, defined as 50% or greater diameter reduction by duplex scanning, occurred after 78 of the endarterectomies; regression of recurrent stenosis occurred in 20 arteries. By life-table analysis the cumulative incidence of restenosis at 7 years was 31%, and the cumulative incidence of regression was 10%. Thus the prevalence of recurrent stenosis at 7 years was 21%. Restenosis developed in women more frequently than men (p = 0.01). Transient ischemic attack occurred in 12% of patients with restenosis, and stroke occurred in 3%; however, the cumulative incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack was not statistically different in those patients with and without restenosis. Similarly, cumulative survival at 7 years was no different. Carotid restenosis usually occurs early in the postoperative period and tends to regress or remain stable during long-term follow-up. A conservative approach to treatment appears justified, since transient ischemic attacks and stroke were rarely associated with restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular ejection fraction is widely regarded as a prognostic indicator of perioperative myocardial infarction. To evaluate this premise the prevalence of perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death was analyzed in relation to preoperative resting gated pool ejection fraction in 85 patients undergoing vascular surgery for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of ejection fraction. Group I consisted of 50 patients with ejection fractions of 56% to 92%. Nine (18%) perioperative myocardial infarctions occurred in group I, and there were no cardiac deaths. Group II consisted of 20 patients with ejection fractions of 37% to 55%. Three (15%) myocardial infarctions occurred in this group, and there were no cardiac deaths. Group III included 15 patients with ejection fractions of 20% to 35%. Three (20%) cardiac events occurred in group III including one nonfatal myocardial infarction and two (13%) cardiac deaths. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in prevalence of cardiac events between any group. These results suggest that resting ejection fraction is a poor predictor of perioperative myocardial infarction in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Patients with normal ejection fractions, but underlying coronary artery disease, are still at significant risk for a perioperative cardiac event.",

    "abstract": "Walking ability and limb hemodynamics were studied in 56 patients with intermittent claudication in an exercise program. Patients walked 1 hour 3 times a week for 3 to 6 months. Ankle and brachial pressures were measured at rest and after a standard walk, and walking ability on the treadmill and during free walking was determined. Average maximal distance on the treadmill increased from 0.59 to 1.00 km after training (p less than 0.0001). Also, after training 84% of patients were able to walk continuously more than 2 km without severe discomfort. The attained walking ability of individual patients could not be predicted from pressure measurements. Small pressure changes after training suggested that factors other than increased development of collateral vessels were important in determining walking ability. Practically useful walking ability was achieved in patients with aortoiliac and femoropopliteal arterial obstruction in the presence or absence of coronary disease and in patients taking beta-blockers. The results indicate that walking exercise is a valuable treatment for many patients with claudication who are not candidates for arterial reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing infection of the arterial wall causes rupture and false (\"mycotic\") aneurysm formation, with a very poor prognosis if untreated. Cure can be achieved by surgical drainage and debridement, with restoration of arterial continuity through uncontaminated tissues. The dilemma of applying these principles to the treatment of mycotic aneurysms of the suprarenal aorta is that no remote or extraanatomic routes are available to maintain perfusion to the viscera. We report the first case of Klebsiella suprarenal mycotic aortic aneurysm successfully treated with in situ prosthetic reconstruction of the aorta and visceral arteries, and we have reviewed the 21 other suprarenal mycotic aortic aneurysms reported in the English-language literature. Repair was performed in 20 of the 22 cases, with in situ prosthetic reconstruction performed in 18. Prolonged survival has been achieved in 16 patients after in situ repair. No long-term survival has been reported after extraanatomic reconstruction of the aorta and visceral arteries in patients with such aneurysms. We conclude that in situ prosthetic reconstruction, accompanied by thorough drainage and debridement, prolonged parenteral antibiotic therapy, and permanent suppressive oral antibiotics, offers the best chance for survival in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Although transaxillary first rib resection is one of the popular treatments for thoracic outlet syndrome today, recurrences and nerve injuries have led to investigation of other operations that might reduce complications and improve results. This article compares the results of transaxillary first rib resection with (1) scalenectomy (anterior and middle) and (2) supraclavicular first rib resection with scalenectomy. Between 1964 and 1987, 668 primary operations were performed for thoracic outlet syndrome on 491 patients. Seventy-one percent were women. Eight-six percent gave histories of neck trauma, often a whiplash injury (traumatic thoracic outlet syndrome); 4.5% had cervical ribs. Common symptoms included paresthesia in the hands (90%); arm pain (80%); neck pain (86%); and occipital headaches (69%). On physical examination, tenderness over the scalene muscles and duplication of symptoms with the arms abducted to 90 degrees in external rotation were present in over 90% of patients. By use of life-table analysis methods, success after surgery was found to be the same for all operations: 91% to 93% at 3 months; 76% to 79% at 1 to 2 years; 70% to 73% at 3 to 5 years; and 69% to 72% at 5 to 10 years. After rib resection plexus injuries occurred in 2.6%, with partial disability in 0.5%. No plexus injuries occurred after scalenectomy, but temporary phrenic nerve palsy occurred in 4.4%. Scalenectomy is as successful an operation as first rib resection for traumatic thoracic outlet syndrome and has fewer serious complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Real-time electrocardiographic monitoring for silent myocardial ischemia was performed on 200 patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery to try to better define those at high risk of perioperative myocardial infarction. The patients were divided into those undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm or lower extremity revascularization procedures (group I, n = 120) and those undergoing carotid artery endarterectomy (group II, n = 80). Silent ischemia was detected during the preoperative, intraoperative, or post-operative periods in 60.8% of group I and 67.5% of group II patients. Six group I and three group II patients suffered an acute perioperative myocardial infarction with two cardiac deaths. In both groups I and II a variety of parameters based on monitoring of silent myocardial ischemia were compared between the subgroups of patients who had myocardial infarction and those who did not. The results show that in both groups there was a significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) greater total duration of perioperative ischemic time, total number of perioperative ischemic episodes, and total duration of perioperative ischemic time as a percent of total monitoring time in patients who suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction compared to those who did not. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of preoperative characteristics in all 200 patients showed the occurrence of preoperative silent myocardial ischemia and angina at rest to be the only significant predictors of perioperative myocardial infarction. Thus perioperative monitoring for silent myocardial ischemia might noninvasively identify those patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery who are at increased risk for perioperative myocardial infarction, permitting implementation of timely preventive measures in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Sixty complications occurred during 138 courses of intraarterial thrombolytic therapy in 122 patients during a 5-year period. These complications were recorded and analyzed prospectively to identify underlying errors in management. There were 31 bleeding episodes, 15 vascular complications, and 14 other complications. Twelve of the bleeding episodes occurred at the puncture site, and 19 occurred at remote sites, accounting for six of the eight deaths in the series. Management errors were clearly identified in 27 of the 60 complications. The three following patterns of errors were recognized: (1) mismanagement of bleeding (12 instances), (2) wrong patient selection (nine instances), and (3) breach of the administration protocol (six instances). The group of 27 complications with underlying management errors included seven of the eight deaths in the present series. Efforts to prevent complications from thrombolytic therapy should concentrate on the specific patterns of management errors identified. This study indicates that low-dose intraarterial thrombolytic therapy is not a low-risk alternative to surgical intervention but should be viewed as a prelude or possible alternative to surgery in selected patients despite the risks involved.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the process of graft degeneration and aneurysm formation we reviewed the angiographic and pathologic findings of three cases where aneurysms developed in glutaraldehyde-tanned human umbilical vein grafts. Seven aneurysms were detected in these three grafts 4 years after implantation. Six aneurysms originated from the bodies of the grafts and one originated from the factory-created anastomosis required for fabrication. Wrinkling and segmentation of the dilated graft documented by arteriography corresponded to mural dissection of the graft wall. Large protrusions near the aneurysms were revealed to be the transmurally dissected graft walls. At the site of dissection, blood escaped through the surrounding mesh of the graft to form a preaneurysmal change. Two aneurysms developed without breakdown of the outer mesh. The aneurysm of factory-created sutures was caused by tearing of the graft wall. Degeneration of human umbilical vein grafts, which appears to ensue inevitably with the passage of time after implantation, leads to the tear of the graft wall and transmural dissection to form aneurysm. In our department, candidates for human umbilical vein graft implantation have recently been restricted to the patients whose life expectancy is limited to only a few years because of the risk of aneurysm formation.",

    "abstract": "The current widespread use of indium 111 oxine for labeling endothelial cells to study their interaction with various bioprosthetic flow surfaces presupposes a high retention of the radioisotope within the cell and a lack of significant adherence of any marker released from the cell to the surface under study. We measured the loss of indium 111 from freshly harvested, canine, venous endothelial cells, and their viability in cell culture, for varying intervals up to 24 hours. At prescribed intervals, aliquots of the radiolabeled endothelial cell suspension were centrifuged, and the supernatant was separated from the cell pellet. The relative radioactivity of each was measured in a gamma well counter and the spontaneous loss of marker from the endothelial cells was calculated. Spontaneous loss of indium 111 was 7.8% +/- 1.9% at 1 hour and 47.6% +/- 1.8% at 24 hours. Loss of activity was virtually constant between 14 and 24 hours. Endothelial cell viability was 80% at 24 hours. We next studied the in vitro affinity of indium 111 oxine and indium 111 transferrin for untreated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts and for similar grafts treated with two surfactants commonly used to increase the \"wetability\" of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, a nonionic sufectant (Nonidet) and tridodecylmethylammonium chloride, and with two glycoproteins, fibronectin and basement membrane gel. A minimum of three graft segments were studied in each group. The affinity of graft material for indium 111, in both its oxine and transferrin complex, was significantly increased by treating the graft with a wetting agent, and it was further increased by the addition of a glycoprotein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
