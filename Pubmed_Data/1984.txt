    "abstract": "The records of 111 consecutive patients undergoing evaluation for possible carotid endarterectomy at the University of Rochester were reviewed. All patients had noninvasive evaluation (oculoplethysmography-Gee and direct, continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography) as well as selective carotid angiography. Patients were grouped by clinical presentation to ascertain the relative importance of angiography in determining the need for surgery. Arteriography added nothing to clinical and noninvasive evaluation in over two thirds of patients with hemispheric cerebral symptoms or asymptomatic carotid bruits. In contrast, we found that almost all patients with nonhemispheric symptoms required angiography for adequate evaluation prior to surgery. The implication of these findings on preoperative evaluation of patients with carotid surgery is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of the nonoperated carotid artery opposite an endarterectomy was examined in 134 patients by means of ultrasonic duplex scanning over a period extending to 48 months. None of the nine deaths that occurred during follow-up was stroke related. A total of 22 arteries showed progression of disease over this period. By life-table analysis the mean annual rate of progression for all categories of disease was 12.6% and 7.4% for progression to a diameter reduction greater than 50%. Disease progression was more rapid in patients under 65 years of age. Symptoms occurred in 13 patients for an overall incidence of 10% and a mean annual rate estimated at 5%. All symptoms indicated transient ischemic attacks; there were no strokes. There was a strong relationship between the development of symptoms and stenoses greater than 80% either at the initial examination or secondary to progression. No correlation was found between the presence of bruits or their change over time and the progression or appearance of symptoms. Conservative management of nonoperated vessels opposite an endarterectomy appears appropriate until symptoms develop or a lesion greater than 80% is detected.",

    "abstract": "The records of all patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in a Midwest city with a stable population over a 30-year period were reviewed. There were 296 patients (196 men and 100 women) for an incidence of 21.1 aneurysms/100,000 person-years. The median age at diagnosis was 69 years for men and 78 years for women. Seventy-eight percent of patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis; their aneurysms were incidental findings. Rupture occurred in 60 patients (20.3%). Thirty-six patients (12.2%) had rupture of the aneurysm as the presenting complication. For previously diagnosed aneurysms that subsequently ruptured, the average period from diagnosis to rupture was 48.7 months. Rupture occurred in only two aneurysms smaller than 5 cm. The overall mortality rate from rupture was 15.5%. Evaluation of data (including autopsy reports) by decade revealed an absolute increase in the incidence of AAAs in the population under study. More aneurysms of all sizes occurred from 1971 to 1980 than in the previous two decades combined. Although ultrasound examination has increased the detection of small aneurysms, the incidence of aneurysms 7 cm or larger at the time of diagnosis has also increased; the frequency of rupture was greatest in the last decade. To compare the data of the population-based study with the statistics for patients seen in a referral practice, the records of 616 patients from a referral population were also reviewed. In the referral population the ratio of men to women was 5:1, and the age at diagnosis was lower for both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From January 1980 until May 1983, 24 patients had surgical exploration of the carotid bifurcation for suspected recent total occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA). All patients had recent onset of neurologic symptoms related to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. Selective carotid angiography determined preoperative total occlusion of the ICA. Because surgery failed to reopen the ICA in nine patients, they had endarterectomy of the external carotid artery. Fifteen patients had initially successful thromboendarterectomy of the ICA. Prior to patient dismissal, patency was documented by B-mode ultrasound or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). All 15 patients had another B-mode ultrasound scan or DSA at least 45 days after thromboendarterectomy. On reexamination four ICAs were reoccluded, but only one patient became symptomatic. There were no operative deaths and no increase in preoperative neurologic deficits. The natural history of patients with total occlusion of the ICA is variable. The most important factor influencing a therapeutic decision is the patient's neurologic status. This study supports an aggressive, early surgical intervention for recent total occlusion in carefully selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Nine hundred forty carotid endarterectomies were performed without the use of a temporary indwelling shunt. Six patients (0.6%) died, all from stroke; 17 other patients (1.8%) had another stroke, and 21 patients (2.2%) had temporary neurologic symptoms. Complete x-ray films detailing the opposite internal carotid artery and carotid artery back pressure were available for 783 operations. Correlation of stroke to back pressure, status of the contralateral internal carotid artery, preoperative neurologic deficit, and carotid clamp time was examined. Statistical analysis demonstrated significantly increased neurologic complications only if the systolic carotid back pressure was less than or equal to 50 mm Hg or the contralateral internal carotid artery was occluded. Analysis to determine if these factors were dependently related showed that when both a contralateral carotid occlusion and a carotid back pressure of less than or equal to 50 mm Hg coexisted (82 patients), the rate of permanent deficit was 11.0% compared with 2.8% when either factor was singly present and 0.9% when neither factor was present. No statistical difference exists between the group with only a single factor and those with neither factor. When a temporary shunt is not used during carotid endarterectomy, the risk of neurologic complication is increased if both a contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion and a carotid back pressure of less than or equal to 50 mm Hg coexist. The use of a shunt in this patient population may be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Ninety-two patients underwent surgical treatment for 59 prosthetic graft infections and 33 secondary aortoenteric fistulas. Definitive treatment was accomplished with a low perioperative mortality rate (14%). Long-term follow-up confirmed that most patients were cured of their infection or fistula, and 88% of the patients who survived the perioperative period (67 of 76) had no further evidence of infection when followed up from 10 months to 12 1/2 years postoperatively. The 12% late mortality rate (9 of 76) was secondary to persistent infection and aortic stump disruption. When perioperative and late deaths in both groups are combined, 67 of 92 patients (73%) were cured of their prosthetic graft infection. Factors associated with a favorable prognosis for survival and cure of infection were autogenous reconstruction and possibly staged operative repair. Poor prognosis for survival and cure of infection resulted from aortic stump disruption, persistent infection, and retained graft material. Significant morbidity (amputation and multiple operative procedures) was related to the severity of underlying vascular disease, the inadequacy of extra-anatomic reconstruction, and in some cases progression of vascular disease. The major challenges in the treatment of graft infection at present are the preoperative identification of limited graft infection and the successful management of the interrupted aorta. Complex and innovative reconstructive procedures continue to be necessary to ensure limb salvage and remain a considerable technical challenge. Nonetheless, the prospects for cure as reported in this series justify an aggressive operative approach. A successful outcome following definitive treatment of these devastating complications is possible for the majority of affected patients.",

    "abstract": "Combining valve replacement with coronary artery bypass (CABG) for significant concomitant disease remains a controversial subject. To determine the operative results following combined valve replacement and CABG, we evaluated 201 patients seen consecutively between July 1977 and June 1982. CABG for vessels with greater than 70% stenosis was performed with aortic valve replacement in 106 patients, with mitral valve replacement in 82, and with aortic and mitral valve replacement in 13. There were 143 men and 58 women; the mean age was 67 years. Nine operative deaths (8.5%) occurred with aortic valve replacement and CABG: 5 of 25 (20%) when cardioplegia was not used and 4 of 81 (4.9%) with cardioplegia (p less than 0.01). The operative mortality rate for isolated aortic valve replacement without coronary disease during the same period was 5.9% (10 of 168). The late actuarial survival rate is similar for aortic valve replacement alone or aortic valve replacement and CABG. There were no operative deaths among patients having undergone aortic and mitral valve replacement and CABG; the rate was 15% (9 of 60) in patients having undergone aortic and mitral replacement and CABG. The operative mortality rate was 21.9% for mitral valve replacement and CABG (18 of 82). Rheumatic disease was present in 14 of these patients, two of whom had early deaths (14.3%), both after repeat mitral operations; 11 mitral valve replacements and CABG were done for degenerative mitral regurgitation with no deaths, and the remaining 57 patients had ischemic mitral regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From March 1960 through January 1968, 71 patients underwent operations for renovascular hypertension at our center. There were three operative deaths in 94 procedures. Primary nephrectomy was performed in 26 patients. Attempted revascularization of 62 kidneys was successful in 46 (74%). In 13 (87%) of the 15 cases considered operative failures, the patients underwent either secondary nephrectomy (11) or repeat revascularization (two). Based on the results of the final operation, initial blood pressure response (1 to 6 months postoperatively) in the surviving patients indicated 44% cured (30 patients), 40% improved (27), and 16% unchanged (11). The sequential clinical, functional, and anatomic follow-up evaluations to time of death or to date are available in 66 of the 68 patients (97%) who survived operation and form the basis of this report. Fifteen- to 20-year arteriographic follow-up in 16 patients revealed one late neointimal anastomotic stenosis and an additional three aortic suture line false aneurysms in Dacron aortorenal grafts. During this 15- to 23-year follow-up, 71% of atherosclerotic (AS) patients and 23% of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) patients died. Cardiovascular (CV) morbid events occurred in 77% of AS patients and in 19% of FMD patients. The cumulative incidence of death and CV morbid events during follow-up is examined by Kaplan-Meier life tables and Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis in these respective groups to identify preoperative markers predictive of longer event-free survival in relation to blood pressure benefit by operation (for example, focal vs. diffuse AS, presence of cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy seen by electrocardiography, azotemia, smoking, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From December 1976 to April 1983, 55 patients underwent operations in which intraluminal ring grafts were used for replacement of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Twenty-eight patients had dissections, and 11 had ascending aneurysms. There were 10 descending aneurysms; three of these were traumatic. There were two arch aneurysms, three abdominal aneurysms, and one thoracoabdominal aneurysm. The follow-up period was 78 months with a mean follow-up period of 24 months. There were six postoperative deaths and six late deaths. No evidence of complications of thrombosis, migration, erosion, or pseudoaneurysm resulting from the ring within the 78-month follow-up period was seen, and we conclude that this is a safe, reliable, quick method for replacement of the aorta in certain well-defined situations.",

    "abstract": "Proper selection of suprainguinal vs. infrainguinal arterial revascularization in patients with multilevel disease requires hemodynamic assessment. In such patients hemodynamic evaluation of the aortoiliac system cannot be made accurately with either arteriography or current noninvasive techniques. One hundred six lower extremities underwent preoperative triplane arteriography, measurement of Doppler-derived segmental blood pressures, measurement of common femoral intra-arterial pressure, and intra-arterial injection (30 mg) of the vasodilator papaverine hydrochloride prior to arterial bypass. Common femoral intra-arterial pressure was monitored continuously before and after papaverine injection. The resting femoral/brachial pressure index (FBI) and the maximum change in this index (% delta FBI) following papaverine injection were calculated. To be considered improved postoperatively, claudicants required an increase in treadmill walking time of greater than or equal to 50%, whereas patients operated on for limb salvage required an increase in the thigh/brachial pressure index (TBI) of greater than or equal to 0.15 for suprainguinal revascularizations and an increase of TBI to greater than or equal to 0.9 for infrainguinal revascularizations. In the first 41 extremities (phase I), receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed a % delta FBI greater than or equal to 15% to be optimal in the detection of hemodynamically significant aortoiliac disease. In phase II (65 limbs) this discriminant value for % delta FBI was assessed prospectively. In phase I, in which the choice of supra- vs. infrainguinal bypass was determined arteriographically, only 80% of the extremities were improved; in phase II, in which supra- vs. infrainguinal bypass was determined by the papaverine test, 98% of extremities were improved (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This article summarizes over 20 years of experience (1962 to 1982) with cervical sympathectomy (thoracic dorsal sympathectomy) in 46 patients undergoing 68 sympathectomies. All operations were performed through an anterior supraclavicular approach. Indications for surgery were intractable Raynaud's disease (26 patients), atherosclerotic obliterative arterial disease (five), causalgia (five), posttraumatic sympathetic dystrophy (seven), collagen vascular disorders (eight), hyperhidrosis (12), occupational-related digital thrombosis (four), and thrombosis secondary to intra-arterial injection (one). The incidence of complications and side effects, both temporary and permanent, including Horner's syndrome, is reviewed in detail. Particular reference is made to the various surgical techniques of managing the stellate ganglion; four patients had two-third to three-fourth resection of the stellate ganglion down to and including the T-3 thoracic ganglion, two had preservation of the stellate ganglion and resection of the T-2 through T-4 ganglia, seven had excision of the entire stellate ganglion down to and including the T-4 ganglion, seven had resection of the lower third of the stellate ganglion down to and including the T-4 ganglion, and 48 had removal of the lower half of the stellate ganglion down to and including the T-3 ganglion. The study reviews the literature germane to anatomic considerations and suggests revisions in current texts and atlases. By retrospective analysis of the records and a follow-up questionnaire, which provided an 86% follow-up (average 8.4 years), the paper points to the distinctive clinical characteristics of the different groups within the population undergoing the operation and provides guidelines for patient selection and conclusions on the place for this operation in the management of vascular diseases involving the upper extremity.",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanism that leads to thrombosis of small-diameter vascular prostheses (less than 4 mm X greater than 6 cm) is unknown. This report presents preliminary patency and healing data on a sequential detergent-extraction technique for the preparation of autogenous small-diameter microvascular grafts. Fifteen carotid interpositional allografts (3 to 4 mm X 4 to 6 cm) were implanted in 15 mixed species adult greyhounds. Ninety days after implantation grafts were perfusion-fixed in situ, harvested, and evaluated by light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Two categories of acellular vascular matrix grafts were evaluated: non-cross-linked and cross-linked (1% carbodiimide). By objective morphologic analysis with blind random view, histologic sections were rated from 0 to 4 in five categories believed to be important for graft healing and patency. Overall graft patency was 80% (12 of 15), and there was no significant difference between cross-linked and non-cross-linked grafts. Non-cross-linked grafts were superior to cross-linked grafts in all areas of histologic evaluation except immunogenicity (p less than 0.01). Most important, non-cross-linked grafts demonstrated complete endothelial coverage (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference (that is, normal) between control autografts and non-cross-linked grafts; however, there was a significant difference between control autografts and cross-linked grafts in all parameters except immunogenic reaction (p less than 0.01).",

    "abstract": "The causes of autogenous saphenous vein (ASV) graft failure have been well described and are predominantly due to stenosis of the ASV graft during the first year after implantation. Distal atherosclerotic disease is a late cause of ASV graft failure. Furthermore, with failure of the ASV graft the clinical and hemodynamic status of the limb usually reverts to the preoperative state. To better define the causes and hemodynamic consequences of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft failure, we reviewed the pathologic findings at surgery and compared these with arteriograms made prior to and after occlusion and sequential noninvasive hemodynamic studies in 36 patients with failed PTFE grafts (greater than 30 days after operation). Distal atherosclerotic disease was the most frequent cause of PTFE failure (23 of 36 limbs, or 64%), and it appeared as early as the first 6 months after implantation. Doppler pressures after PTFE failure deteriorated significantly (p less than 0.05) at the thigh, calf, and ankle levels. A blinded comparison of preoperative with postoperative arteriograms revealed significant progression of disease. Because of significant involvement of the popliteal artery in our series, treatment of intimal hyperplasia with patch angioplasty (seven cases, or 19%) was short lived and sequential extension was required. Distal atherosclerotic disease therefore appeared to be the most common cause of PTFE graft failure and occurred much earlier after implantation than with ASV graft failure. Deterioration of the hemodynamic state of the limb correlated with this high degree of distal atherosclerotic disease.",

    "abstract": "From 1978 through 1981 complete perioperative information concerning a total of 10,189 peripheral vascular procedures performed in northeastern Ohio was recorded in the computer registry of The Cleveland Vascular Society. This report is an analysis of mortality and morbidity rates for all 5686 operations involving carotid endarterectomy (N = 2646), lower extremity revascularization (N = 1987), and abdominal aortic aneurysm resection (N = 1053). The operative mortality rate was 1.2% for carotid reconstruction, 2.8% for femoropopliteal or distal bypass, 3.5% for aortofemoral revascularization, and 11.9% for aortic aneurysm resection (elective operations 6.5%; emergency operations 32.9%). Postoperative strokes occurred after endarterectomy in 2.7% of patients having preoperative neurologic symptoms and in 2.0% of those with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Lower extremity amputation was unavoidable in 1.5% of patients after aortofemoral reconstruction and in 6.0% after femoropopliteal or distal bypass. Statistical testing indicated that the operative mortality rate was not related to the respective size of the 27 hospitals involved in the survey. The relative annual experience of the 29 participating surgeons significantly influenced only the mortality rate of elective aneurysm resection and the amputation rate after femoropopliteal or distal revascularization. This study suggests that the results of major arterial reconstruction in metropolitan areas may be expected to be comparable to those of published series if the responsible surgeons are specifically trained and maintain an active interest in the field of vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Preferred treatment for thromboembolism when heparin fails or is contraindicated is infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC) interruption. In the present study suprarenal Greenfield filters were placed in 11 patients in whom routine infrarenal IVC interruption would have been inadequate therapy. As identified by IVC venography, nine patients, including two patients with renal vein thrombi and proteinuria, had partially attached IVC thrombi extending to or above the orifices of the renal veins. One patient had multiple life-threatening pulmonary emboli (PE) on anticoagulation therapy without a known source of emboli and a large patent ovarian vein, and another had an ovarian vein thrombus. Five patients (45%) had a contraindication to heparin therapy, and five (45%) had recurrent PE on anticoagulants. In follow-up (range 3 to 26 months, mean 12.3 months) there has been no documented or suspected recurrent PE, change in renal function, or peripheral edema. There were two deaths secondary to malignancy. IVC patency was demonstrated in all patients studied. Eight patients continue to receive anticoagulants. Based on our clinical experience, our data suggest that suprarenal filter placement is indicated in the following situations: (1) recurrent thromboemboli despite anticoagulation therapy with IVC thrombi extending to or above the renal veins, renal vein thrombosis, previous IVC interruption, or a large patent left ovarian vein or (2) documented perirenal IVC thrombi when anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated. The results of this study indicate that when thromboemboli originate at or above the level of the renal veins in the IVC, suprarenal IVC filter placement is effective therapy.",

    "abstract": "The previously stated advantages of the valve incision method of in situ saphenous vein arterial bypass have now been confirmed by others. However, this method has been limited by its time-consuming technical demands. Considerable experience with this bypass in conjunction with retrograde serial valve disruption with instruments of similar design principle (by Hall and Cartier) has been accumulated in Europe. However, the combination of the trauma of blunt valvular fracture and the sensitivity of endothelium to frictional shear has precluded use of these instruments in veins less than 4 mm in size, and the results have not been significantly better than those obtained with reversed vein bypass. An instrument (valve cutter) that achieves serial valve incision safely and consistently without mandatory exposure of each valve site has now been developed. Of the last 166 consecutive bypasses, the saphenous vein was suitable for use of this instrument in 116 instances (70%). The patency of these bypasses as determined by life-table analysis has shown no significant difference when compared with bypasses performed under similar conditions in which the cutter was not used. On the basis of this investigative and clinical experience, the majority of in situ saphenous vein arterial bypasses can be safely facilitated and simplified by use of this instrument.",

    "abstract": "Nineteen patients with 20 occluded arterial bypass grafts were treated with local infusion of streptokinase. Grafts treated included four aortofemoral graft limbs, 14 femoropopliteal or femorotibial grafts, one axillofemoral graft, and one transpubic femorofemoral graft. Complete lysis of thrombus was possible in 12 patients, partial lysis in five patients, and no lysis in two patients. Thrombolytic therapy was thought to be beneficial in the management of 14 patients. In two of these 14 only thrombolysis was required to restore and maintain graft patency, and in an additional two patients angioplasty was performed after thrombolytic therapy with no subsequent therapy necessary. In three patients who were initially poor operative risks, surgery could be postponed. Thrombolysis revealed the probable cause of thrombosis in 12 patients. Complications included four bleeding episodes, two of which were significant. There were no significant embolic complications. Unsuccessful thrombolytic therapy did not result in worsening of ischemia in any patient. Local infusion of thrombolytic agents is a useful adjunct in the management of occluded bypass grafts.",

Critical deficiencies were noted in the immune status of all the patients. Enhancement of immune responses with accelerated recovery occurred in 8 of the 12 patients who received total parenteral nutritional support. The four patients who exhibited anergy and were not given the benefits of supplemental nutrition endured a prolonged convalescence, and two subsequently died. This study brought to our attention not only the prevalence of depressed host resistance in these critically ill individuals with advanced prosthetic graft injections but also the benefits of adjunctive parenteral nutritional support in combination with the more conventional modes of therapy, including antibiotics, surgical removal of the septic nidus, and bypass to restore arterial continuity.",

    "abstract": "This report attempts to establish the place of real-time B-mode carotid imaging in the diagnosis of carotid artery disease through an analysis of the results of 3 years of experience in three major noninvasive vascular laboratories. Over 7000 patients were studied noninvasively with real-time B-mode carotid imaging and oculoplethysmography (OPG). Angiographic comparisons of 1723 vessels form the basis of this study. All tests were interpreted by physicians who had no knowledge of the angiograms. Images and x-ray films were classified by diameter of stenosis: grade I (0% to 39%), grade II (40% to 69%), grade III (70% to 99%), and grade IV (total occlusion). The effect of the imaging experience was determined by dividing the study into two periods. The results of image quality vs. accuracy and of combining the anatomic study (scan) and physiologic study (OPG) were also evaluated. The overall data show a specificity of 87% (985 of 1139), a sensitivity for grade II disease of 72% (193 of 267), a sensitivity for grade III of 66% (133 of 201), and a sensitivity for grade IV of 64% (74 of 116). With experience each center showed improvement of the imaging technique in diagnosing grade III (p greater than 0.1: not significant) and grade IV disease (p less than 0.0002: highly significant), although there was no improvement in the specificity and sensitivity of grade II disease. All scan errors were analyzed. Most errors were interpretation errors (27%: 90 of 338), scan/arteriogram mismatches (23%: 79 of 338), or poor-quality scans secondary to existing disease (22%: 75 of 338). There was a direct correlation of scan quality and accuracy, with a 97% specificity for grade I scans of good to excellent quality. When the scan and OPG agreed, there were uniform predictive values for all grades (88% to 93%). Sixteen of 79 scan/arteriogram mismatch vessels were operated on, and the scan proved more reliable in 86%. Real-time B-mode carotid imaging is a reliable technique for defining the normal carotid artery and is becoming increasingly sensitive in identifying existing disease. Despite its limitations, its strong points make it a valuable clinical tool.",

    "abstract": "The use of operative arteriography during carotid endarterectomy facilitates identification and correction of technical errors. Although arteriography is the standard for assessing surgical results, it prolongs the operation and may increase the overall risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pulsed Doppler spectral analysis and arteriography as methods of intraoperative assessment. Operative arteriography was performed in 150 consecutive carotid endarterectomies. In 50 of these cases a sterile 20 MHz pulsed Doppler probe and real-time spectrum analyzer were used to evaluate internal carotid velocity patterns before and after endarterectomy. Operative arteriograms were normal in 127 cases, whereas abnormalities were noted in 16 internal and seven external carotid arteries. Thirteen of the arteriographic defects were considered minor and accepted. Major defects requiring immediate repair occurred in eight (5%) internal and two external carotid arteries. In the 50 cases assessed by both techniques, seven internal carotid arteries had mild flow disturbances both before and after endarterectomy, whereas 38 of the remaining 43 arteries showed improvement in spectral characteristics after endarterectomy. In two patients who failed to show improvement on the initial postendarterectomy evaluation, operative arteriography demonstrated residual defects that required immediate repair. No other technical errors were encountered, and there were no perioperative deaths or neurologic complications in the 150 operations. Intraoperative assessment by pulsed Doppler spectral analysis is a safe, rapid, and accurate method for detecting technical errors during carotid endarterectomy. The high sensitivity of this method (no false negative assessments) makes it an ideal screening test to be used for selection of patients for operative arteriography. By indicating when a technical error is most likely, this approach precludes the need for routine operative arteriography.",

    "abstract": "Serial platelet deposition, surface topography, and patency were evaluated in control (N = 28) and endothelial cell-seeded (N = 28) small-diameter (4 mm inner diameter) USCI Dacron grafts implanted in the carotid and femoral arteries of dogs. All dogs received aspirin (325 mg) daily for 2 weeks starting 24 hours prior to graft implantation. Endothelial cell seeding was performed by mixing suspensions of autologous endothelial cells that had been enzymatically harvested from segments of external jugular vein with blood that was used to preclot the prostheses. The platelet deposition on each graft was quantitated by means of indium 111-labeled platelets and technetium 99m-labeled red cells in a dual-isotope platelet-imaging technique. Platelet deposition on seeded grafts 24 hours after implantation was significantly higher than on the controls (p less than 0.05). Two weeks after implantation platelet deposition on seeded prostheses had decreased to a level significantly lower than that on the controls and continued to decline on serial studies up to 7 months. In contrast to seeded grafts, platelet accumulation on control grafts dramatically increased after the withdrawal of aspirin therapy and was associated with a sharp rise in control graft thromboses. Gross and scanning electron microscopic evaluation of endothelial cell-seeded grafts after 1 month indicated complete neointimal coverage, whereas none of the control grafts explanted at 1 month or later exhibited a continuous neointimal lining. Cumulative 7-month patency for seeded prostheses was significantly higher than for the controls (96% and 29%, respectively; p less than 0.001). We conclude that endothelial cell seeding in combination with short-term aspirin therapy is a simple, reliable diameter Dacron prostheses. Abrupt withdrawal of aspirin therapy may be contraindicated in nonseeded control grafts because it results in increased platelet deposition and thrombosis.",

Diastolic/systolic frequency correlated well with increased RVR induced by microsphere injections (p less than 0.05).

Therefore, this study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of PGE1 in the treatment of ischemic ulcers in patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD). One hundred twenty patients with one to three ischemic ulcers not healing for 3 weeks with standard care were randomized to receive either PGE1 (20 ng/kg/min) or a placebo for 72 hours through a central venous catheter. Ulcers were measured and photographed, and the rest pain was evaluated before and after infusion and at 1- and 2-month follow-up intervals. Fifty-seven patients with 95 ulcers received PGE1. Seventeen ulcers healed (18%); 22 ulcers decreased in size (23%); 37 ulcers remained unchanged or increased in size (39%); five new ulcers developed during the study (5%); and 14 ulcers had inadequate follow-up (15%). Sixty-three patients with 115 ulcers received a placebo. Nineteen ulcers healed (16%); 38 ulcers decreased in size (33%); 45 ulcers remained unchanged or increased in size (39%); three new ulcers developed during the study (3%); and 10 ulcers had inadequate follow-up (9%). None of the above differences between the drug-treated group and the placebo-treated group was statistically significant.

    "abstract": "Graft thrombosis soon after reconstruction remains a major obstacle to the use of reversed vein grafts in infrapopliteal reconstruction. Our clinical experience with in situ vein grafts corroborates Leather's results by demonstrating an overall graft patency of 95% below the knee at 1 year and 94% in the infrapopliteal group. It has been postulated that this improved early patency rate of in situ vein grafts is the result of more optimal preservation of the endothelium of the vein graft. To investigate this hypothesis, human saphenous veins were handled by an in situ and a reversed technique. The intact vein segments were then tested for luminal production of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 and fixed for scanning electron microscopic analysis of the surface morphology. This study demonstrated that endothelial cell prostacyclin release is enhanced in human in situ vein segments but not in reversed vein segments. In addition, luminal production of thromboxane A2 is significantly greater in the reversed than in the in situ vein segments. These findings are associated with marked endothelial structural damage in the reversed veins and minimal endothelial disruption in the in situ veins. Therefore the ratio of the antiaggregatory vasodilator prostacyclin to the proaggregatory vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 is significantly more favorable for the in situ vein segment than for the reversed vein segment. The observed excellent early patency of the in situ vein grafts in our poor-risk patient population may in part be the result of this favorable balance of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 and the more optimally preserved endothelial morphology.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in needles, sutures, and technique, hemorrhage remains a problem in cardiovascular surgery. In this study conventional vascular suture lines and suture lines reinforced with fibrin sealant are compared for blood loss and burst strength. Bilateral femoral arteries in 20 dogs were divided at 50% of their circumference and repaired with six 6-0 polypropylene sutures. Ten animals were systemically heparinized (3 mg/kg), and 10 were not on anticoagulants. The right femoral artery anastomosis was treated with fibrin sealant in all animals, and the left suture line served as the control. Three minutes after initiation of the sealing procedure, blood flow was reinstituted in both femoral arteries. After 3 minutes a significant difference in blood loss between the conventional suture technique and fibrin-reinforced anastomoses was noted in both heparinized (12.1 +/- 2.79 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.06 ml/min; p less than 0.01) and nonheparinized dogs (8.45 +/- 1.37 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.08 ml/min; p less than 0.001). After 30 minutes volume inflow and pressure catheters were inserted into snared compartments encompassing the femoral artery anastomosis. Continuous pressure recordings during volume loading with normal saline solution demonstrated increased bursting pressures of the fibrin-sealed suture lines in both the heparinized (317.5 +/- 13.18 vs. 135 +/- 23.17 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and nonheparinized animals (474.5 +/- 26.82 vs. 311 +/- 29.31 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). Histologic examination revealed no fibrosis or foreign body reaction and complete resorption of the fibrin sealant within 3 weeks. Fibrin sealant, a powerful hemostatic agent produced from human donors not suffering from hepatitis, decreases blood loss and strengthens suture lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Composite grafts of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and saphenous vein were used for sequential bypasses to the ankle and foot in 35 men and 19 women (mean age 66.5 years). Presenting symptoms were rest pain (25), digital gangrene (19), and ischemic ulcer (10). Thirty-one tibial and 23 pedal bypasses were done and were followed up to 48 months (mean 26.4 months). The ankle pressure index rose from 0.31 +/- 0.11 preoperatively to 0.77 +/- 0.21 postoperatively. Mean graft flows were 34.8 ml/min. Composite sequential grafts took 51 minutes longer to perform than femoral-tibial vein grafts. Patency rates by the life-table method were 81.4% at 2 years and 72.4% at 4 years. Graft failures after the first 10 weeks usually led to amputation. Use of PTFE as an inflow conduit permits otherwise inadequate lengths of saphenous vein to be used for anastomosis to delicate distal vessels and takes advantage of the vein's ability to tolerate low flows. Our experience suggests that the excellent patency rates make sequential bypasses a reasonable option for limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "The use of transcutaneous oxygen tension (TCpO2) measurements to objectively and noninvasively diagnose peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and to aid in the planning of vascular surgery was investigated. Thirty-two normal subjects and 100 patients with PAOD were studied. TCpO2 values decreased with age; when normalized by measurements on the chest, they did not. Absolute and normalized values of TCpO2 were equally effective in identifying the presence of PAOD and accurately characterized different degrees of severity (claudication vs. rest pain vs. impending gangrene; p less than 0.001). This was true even in diabetic patients, in whom tests based on hemodynamic function were less reliable. Healing of amputations was observed when TCpO2 greater than or equal to 38 mm Hg either preoperatively or after reconstruction; failure to heal in the absence of infection was associated with TCpO2 less than or equal to 38 mm Hg. The need for revascularization was associated with TCpO2 less than 30 mm Hg. A similar distribution of TCpO2 values was associated with success vs. failure of ulcer healing. TCpO2 is a useful complement to standard hemodynamic tests in the diagnosis and management of PAOD and, in addition, provides some distinct advantages.",

    "abstract": "A significant number of saphenous vein femoral-popliteal bypass graft failures have been attributed to flow abnormalities caused by venous valves. Seventy-seven greater saphenous vein valves were observed and photographed through a 0-degree choledochoscope during pulsatile and nonpulsatile flow. No valve was seen to lie flat against the vein wall. With pulsatile flow the valves were noted to close during diastole. Stasis was noted within the valve cusps. Twenty-three valves produced photographs of sufficient quality to allow measurement of the luminal obstruction caused by the valves. This valvular obstruction represented 61% +/- 12% of the total vein lumen. Fifty venous valves were lysed by five different techniques: the microscissors, the Connolly vein stripper, the Mills valvulotome, the venotomy valvulectomy of Hall, and eversion valvulectomy. The first three methods created valvular incompetence, but flaps of valve cusps were observed to disturb flow and place potentially thrombogenic surfaces within the vein lumen. Valvulectomy, whether by venotomy or eversion, removed the valve cusps satisfactorily.",

    "abstract": "This investigation documented the hemodynamic effects of rapid intravenous and intra-arterial administration of protamine sulfate, altered platelet kinetics associated with intravenous protamine sulfate administration, and a possible method of reducing protamine sulfate-induced hypotension. Thirty-six anesthetized dogs underwent continuous hemodynamic monitoring prior to heparinization (150 U/kg) and for 30 minutes after rapid reversal with protamine sulfate (1.5 mg/kg over 10 seconds). Platelet counts, platelet aggregation, and serum thromboxane B2 levels were also assessed. Intra-arterial protamine sulfate administration caused fewer adverse hemodynamic changes than intravenous administration, including significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced falls in mean arterial pressure (-10 vs. -35 mm Hg), cardiac output (-0.2 vs. -0.6 L/min), femoral artery blood flow (+ 34 vs. -16 ml/min), and superior mesenteric artery flow (+ 107 vs. -48 ml/min). Thrombocytopenia following protamine sulfate administration was the same in the two groups. Marked hypotension accompanying intravenous protamine sulfate administration was completely attenuated by a small dose of protamine sulfate (0.75 mg/kg) administered prior to heparinization. Similarly, the thrombocytopenia caused by intravenous administration was significantly lessened by protamine sulfate pretreatment (74% vs. 23% reduction; p less than 0.01). These observations have important implications for both experimental and clinical use of heparin and protamine sulfate.",

The perioperative stroke rate was independent of whether nonhemispheric or carotid territory symptoms were present preoperatively (2.8% vs. 3.5%). Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 4 years. Carotid endarterectomy was successful in ameliorating symptoms in patients meeting the criteria for \"classic\" vertebrobasilar insufficiency more often than in patients not meeting these criteria (73% vs 43% asymptomatic at 24 months). Carotid endarterectomy was successful in patients with carotid stenoses of greater than 60% diameter reduction more often than in patients with smaller stenoses (77% vs. 36% asymptomatic at 24 months).

    "abstract": "To define the group of patients at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and death associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, resting gated blood pool studies were obtained on 50 such aneurysm patients preoperatively. The results indicated that three groups could be distinguished among these patients by cardiac ejection fraction. Group I (n = 25) had preoperative ejection fractions ranging from 56% to 85%. None of the patients in group I suffered an acute perioperative MI. Group II (n = 20) comprised patients with ejection fractions ranging from 36% to 55%. There was a 20% incidence of MI in group II but no cardiac deaths. Group III included five patients with ejection fractions ranging from 27% to 35%. There was an 80% incidence of perioperative MI in these patients, with one cardiac death and one cardiac arrest. All perioperative MIs occurred within the first 48 hours after surgery. In addition there was a 50% incidence of perioperative MI among all those patients who were 80 years of age or older. These results indicate guidelines for the management of patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair based on their preoperative ejection fraction. The data further suggest that the noninvasive gated blood pool method of determining ejection fraction may serve a more broadly useful function in helping to determine which of those patients about to undergo major surgical procedures are at high risk for perioperative MI.",

    "abstract": "Ibuprofen reduces early occlusion and surface thrombogenicity of small-diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in sheep. The following experiments were designed to determine the effects of cyclooxygenase inhibition by ibuprofen on long-term patency and arterial wall and graft neointima prostaglandin synthesis. Crossover PTFE grafts (internal diameter 4 mm) were interposed between the carotid arteries of 18 sheep. Nine animals were used as controls, and nine received ibuprofen, 10 mm/kg intravenously, 1 hour prior to surgery and then every 8 hours for the duration of the experiment. Grafts were removed either when they became occluded or routinely at 60 days. Arterial segments adjacent to anastomoses were removed at graft insertion and at graft removal for assay of arterial wall production of the prostaglandins 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 (TxB2). There was no difference in patency between control animals (four out of nine) and ibuprofen-treated (five out of nine) animals. Arterial segments removed before the administration of ibuprofen produced 2.59 +/- 1.48 nM/mg protein/20 min of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2.59 +/- 1.38 nM/mg protein/20 min of TxB2. A single dose of ibuprofen reduced the levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha to 0.30 +/- 0.12 nM/mg protein/20 min and the levels of TxB2 to 0.78 +/- 0.41 nM/mg protein/20 min (p less than 0.01). When the grafts were removed, control animals showed a reduction of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha to 1.69 +/- 0.86 nM/mg protein/20 min, whereas TxB2 levels remained unchanged at 2.54 +/- 1.23 nM/mg protein/20 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From 1968 through 1982, 129 homologous vein grafts were used in 91 patients in the following positions: 75 in the femoropopliteal, tibial, or peroneal artery; 38 in the aortocoronary artery; 13 in the aortopulmonary artery; and one each in the atrioventricular fistula, carotid-subclavian artery, and brachial-radial artery. In the lower extremity patency ranged from 0 to 121 months (mean 22.4 +/- 4.4 months). All grafts were performed for limb salvage, and 75% of the patients had undergone previous operations. Cumulative patency by the life-table method showed that while 50% of grafts occluded by 1 year, 60% of the remaining grafts continued to be functional for more than 5 years. Fifty percent of the aortocoronary bypass grafts studied were occluded at 1 year. Eight of the 13 systemic pulmonary artery shunts were patent at time of death, revision, or total correction. Multiple revisions and thrombectomies are required to maintain patency of homograft veins. The outcome is variable and unpredictable. The inconsistency is due to the antigenicity of the graft. If one is committed to the necessary efforts required to ensure long-term patency, the homologous saphenous vein is a suitable substitute when autogenous tissue is unavailable.",

    "abstract": "When the aorta must be temporarily occluded at the suprarenal or supraceliac levels during surgery, the resulting large increase in afterload may make the myocardium ischemic, even though systemic and pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac output are maintained at normal levels. These traditional indices of myocardial well-being do not appear to be sufficiently sensitive, since cardiac complications are still the most frequent cause of perioperative death and morbidity after aortic reconstruction. To evaluate two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography as a monitor of myocardial well-being, we studied 24 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class III or IV adult patients who were undergoing aortic reconstruction and occlusion at the supraceliac (n = 12), suprarenal-infraceliac (n = 6), or infrarenal (n = 6) level. In addition to traditional monitors, we used a gastroscope tipped with a special 3.5 MHz two-dimensional echocardiographic transducer (Diasonics) that was placed in the esophagus to give a cross-sectional view of the left ventricle through the base of the papillary muscles. The hemodynamic effects of clamping the aorta were managed by administration of vasodilating drugs, anesthetics, and fluids to keep systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures normal. Occlusion at the supraceliac level caused major increases in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic areas, decreases in ejection fraction, and frequent wall motion abnormalities; these changes were not detected by conventional monitoring devices. Occlusion at the suprarenal-infraceliac level caused similar but smaller changes, and occlusion at the infrarenal level caused only minimal cardiovascular effects. We conclude that the two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram offers promise as an intraoperative monitoring device.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate long-term survival in relation to preoperative risk factors, we reviewed 1112 patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair from 1970 to 1975. A 6-to 12-year follow-up was obtained on 1087 patients (97.7%) by chart review, death certificates, autopsy reports, and questionnaires returned by patients and referring physicians. Preoperatively 24% of patients had a history of prior myocardial infarction, 19.9% had a history of angina, and 40.4% were hypertensive. Emergency operation for ruptured aneurysm was performed in 6.5% and for expanding aneurysm in 3.4% of patients. The survival rate at 5 years was 67.5% and at 10 years was 40.7%. Cardiac-related problems were the most frequent cause of death (38%); 23% died of myocardial infarction and 15% from other heart disease or sudden death. Other causes included neoplasm (14.6%), other ruptured aneurysm (8.2%), and stroke (6.8%). Cause of death was unknown in 19.6%. A significant correlation of reduced survival time was noted in patients with advanced age and those with evidence of heart disease or hypertension. For patients without preoperative evidence of heart disease or hypertension, the 5-year mortality rate from myocardial infarction was 3.7%, compared with 11.7% for those with a positive history of hypertension and heart disease (p = 0.0001). For patients with no preoperative evidence of hypertension or heart disease, the length of survival after AAA repair was the same as that expected for the general population with the same age and sex composition. This study supports the contention that coronary angiography and prophylactic coronary bypass grafting should be performed selectively. Decisions regarding the need for coronary revascularization should be based on symptoms, noninvasive testing, and selective coronary angiography because aneurysmal disease alone is not shown in this study to increase the risk of death from myocardial disease. For patients with clinical findings of coronary artery disease, an aggressive diagnostic approach appears to be justified.",

The following principles of management have evolved. (1) Although it is often difficult, differentiation between embolisms and acute thromboses is important. (2) Preoperative angiography is useful. (3) Immediate heparinization is indicated. However, it is not a suitable substitute for a necessary operation. (4) Long-term heparin therapy (instead of operation) does not produce better results for an embolism. However, it is useful for recent acute thrombosis with a viable limb.

The concentration of collagen required to produce half-maximal platelet aggregation (Kd), the platelet aggregation ratio, antithrombin III, factor VIII-related antigen, and fibrinolytic activity (platelet-rich plasma) was measured preoperatively and 3 and 7 days after surgery. Before surgery eight patients exhibited an increase of platelet reactivity to collagen. Following femorotibial bypass grafting, the mean preoperative Kd of 0.52 +/- 0.37 microgram/ml fell to 0.34 +/- 0.35 microgram/ml on the third postoperative day (P less than 0.001) and returned to 0.41 +/- 0.72 microgram/ml on day 7. Factor VIII-related antigen increased from a mean preoperative value of 248 +/- 29% of normal activity to a mean of 360 +/- 96% on postoperative day 3 (p less than 0.01) and further increased to 428 +/- 78% on day 7 (p less than 0.01). Fourteen patients had antithrombin III measurements taken, and their levels also fell on the third postoperative day (110 +/- 5.7% to 71 +/- 6.5%; p less than 0.001). No significant changes in fibrinolytic activity were noted. Persistent platelet reactivity was found in seven patients beyond the seventh postoperative day. After administration of 325 mg of aspirin, the abnormal platelet reactivity ceased. Increased platelet reactivity to collagen, factor VIII-related antigen, and a decrease in the antithrombin III level are indicative of a hypercoagulable state in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From January 1979 through December 1982, 2026 patients scheduled to undergo open heart surgery were evaluated by a preoperative battery of noninvasive carotid tests including phonoangiography, oculopneumoplethysmography, pulse-timing oculoplethysmography, periorbital Doppler examination, and during the last 12 months, continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography with spectral analysis. The incidence of hemispheric neurologic deficit following cardiac surgery in the 47 patients with carotid disease was 14.9%; the incidence in patients with no carotid disease was 1.9% (p less than 0.001). Fourteen of the 47 patients were not candidates for carotid surgery because of unilateral occlusion in 13 and bilateral occlusion in one. Three of the 14 (21.4%) had intraoperative strokes on the appropriate side. Thirty-three of the 47 had operable carotid disease. Four with unilateral stenosis had no carotid surgery; one had a postoperative deficit on the side referable to the nonstenotic artery. Eighteen with unilateral stenosis underwent simultaneous cardiac and carotid surgery; one (5.6%) had a transient deficit. Seven patients with bilateral stenosis underwent cardiac and unilateral carotid surgery; no deficits occurred. Four patients with unilateral stenosis and contralateral occlusion underwent combined surgery; one had a transient ischemic attack and one a fatal stroke, both referable to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion. It appears that the presence of carotid disease increased the risk of stroke during heart surgery. Proof that carotid endarterectomy lowers this risk awaits a prospective randomized trial.",

    "abstract": "Two simple methods for direct antibacterial protection of synthetic vascular grafts were investigated. In the first protocol the highly protein-bound antibiotics nafcillin (90% protein bound), cefazolin (80%), and cefamandole (70%) were added directly to preclotting blood. Knitted Dacron grafts preclotted in the presence of one of these drugs absorbed significant amounts. Although at high concentrations these antibiotics exhibited anticoagulant effects, significant antibacterial protection was obtained at lower antibiotic levels. Washing treated grafts for 6 hours failed to eliminate the antibacterial activity. Antibiotics remained on the grafts for at least 96 hours. In the second protocol knitted Dacron grafts were soaked in a suspension of silver-pefloxacin, a silver-nalidixic acid analogue with intense antistaphylococcic activity. Using 110Ag-labeled complexes, significant antibiotic activity was documented on the graft after 19 days of washing. Four nafcillin-treated prostheses, six silver-pefloxacin-coated grafts, and 11 control grafts were interposed in the infrarenal aorta of dogs and immediately challenged with an intravenous infusion of 1 X 10(7) Staphylococcus aureus. None of the four nafcillin-treated grafts was infected at 3 weeks. One of the six silver-pefloxacin-coated grafts grew staphylococci, and 9 of 11 controls had positive graft cultures for Staphylococcus when harvested. These studies suggest that prosthetic grafts can be simply coated at the time of implantation with antibiotics selected for appropriate binding and antibacterial characteristics to obtain an infection-resistant prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial healing of Dacron arterial prostheses can be hastened in dogs by seeding autogenous venous endothelium onto the prostheses in a single-staged operation. To determine whether this technique enhances the patency of human grafts, we studied the results of 186 operations on 161 patients performed between February 23, 1978, and December 1, 1982. Alternately allocating patients to treatment with seeded and unseeded Dacron knitted prostheses, we performed axillary-femoral and axillary-femoral-femoral bypasses in 11 patients (six seeded and five unseeded) and femoral-femoral bypasses in 28 (13 seeded and 15 unseeded). By a randomized block method of treatment allocation, femoral-popliteal grafts were installed in 147 limbs (112 vein, 18 seeded, and 17 unseeded). Patency was analyzed by the life-table method. Overall, femoral-femoral and femoral-popliteal bypasses demonstrated no difference between the seeded and unseeded grafts. Patency was somewhat better in seeded than unseeded axillary-femoral bypasses. Nevertheless, nonsmokers with seeded femoral-popliteal Dacron grafts enjoyed a significantly better graft patency than those with unseeded grafts (p = 0.035), whereas a substantial deterioration of seeded Dacron grafts was observed in those patients who smoked (p = 0.008 at 6 months). Vein grafts performed better than either seeded or unseeded Dacron prostheses (p = 0.016). Serum beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) levels varied widely and did not differ among any of the treatment groups. We concluded that endothelial seeding improved the patency of human arterial prostheses but that results were worse if the patient was a smoker. BTG was not a useful measure of the platelet activation induced by an arterial prosthesis.",

The procedure was a prophylactic measure in 185 patients, elective surgery in 349, and an emergency procedure in 102. Portal hypertension was due to cirrhosis of the liver in 464 patients (40 alcoholic and 424 cryptogenic), idiopathic portal hypertension in 99, extrahepatic portal vein occlusion in 38, hepatoma in 22, and other causes in 13. The operative mortality rates were as follows: emergency 13.7%, elective cases 3.2%, prophylactic cases 4.3%, and overall 5.2%. There were no deaths in the 233 patients in Child's clinical class A; 232 class B patients had a 2% mortality rate, and 171 class C patients had a 17% mortality rate. The 10-year actuarial survival rates in patients with cirrhosis of the liver were 55% in emergency cases and 72% in both prophylactic and elective cases. In patients without cirrhosis the survival rates were 90%, 96%, and 95%, respectively. Recurrence of variceal bleeding or varices was less than 5%. We conclude that the Sugiura procedure is safe and effective in controlling esophageal varices and prolongs the long-term survival of patients with portal hypertension.",

Prophylaxis in the absence of embolism is a less common indication (18%), but increasingly favorable experience by others with the filter in place of anticoagulation therapy in the elderly may alter the approach to these patients. Although two patients with massive embolism who had undergone pulmonary embolectomy died postoperatively, no deaths occurred as a result of filter placement. Only one of the remaining 35 patients who died (14%) within 2 weeks of filter placement had suspected recurrent embolism. Follow-up studies in 99 patients extending to 100 months showed only two early and no late occlusions of the filter, for a long-term patency rate of 98%. The recurrent embolism rate of 5% is comparable to that of previously reported experience and appears to be independent of the use of long-term anticoagulation therapy.",

    "abstract": "The majority of patients with venous thromboembolism are successfully managed with anticoagulation therapy, but certain patients require inferior vena cava (IVC) interruption. Traditional open operations on the IVC have important disadvantages, among which are significant morbidity and mortality. Twenty years ago work began to develop a transvenous method to interrupt the IVC. As the requirements for a safe and effective method were defined, it became apparent that the best approach would be with a catheter-delivered detachable balloon secured by hyperinflation in the distensible IVC. The concept of a \"filter\" was discarded because of predicted problems with thrombosis, induced embolism, and device migration. We have treated 135 patients with the Hunter IVC balloon. Sick patients tolerate the procedure, and it is highly effective in preventing pulmonary embolism. Leg morbidity is acceptable, parallels the extent of the phlebitis, and is lessened by leg care and simultaneous anticoagulation therapy. Long-term results with follow-up to 13 years are excellent.",

    "abstract": "The effect of laboratory evidence of renal parenchymal abnormality on the results of renal revascularization in 83 patients with renovascular hypertension was determined. Primary renal disease (PRD) was defined as an abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria, hematuria, or casts) in the absence of urinary infection, or decreased renal function (elevated serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dl and/or decreased creatinine clearance). All patients were hypertensive on medical therapy preoperatively. Patients were defined as cured if postoperative diastolic blood pressure (BP) was less than 90 mm Hg on no medication and improved if BP less than 90 mm Hg on medication. Sixty-six patients (80%) were cured or improved following revascularization. Of 45 patients (63%) with evidence of PRD preoperatively, 28 (62%) were cured or improved compared with 33 patients without PRD, of whom all (100%) were cured or improved (p less than 0.001). Each of five patients with transplant renal artery stenosis had two operations; four were cured or improved. The serum creatinine level was elevated preoperatively in 37 cases. Eighteen of the 37 (49%) improved to within normal limits following operation. Fifteen patients had simultaneous bilateral renal artery revascularization, and 12 (80%) were cured or improved. Fourteen patients (17%) had concomitant vascular procedures: aortobifemoral bypass (seven), abdominal aneurysm resection (five), femoral endarterectomy (one), and aortoiliac bypass (one). Twelve of these 15 patients had PRD, and 8 of the 12 (67%) were cured or improved. Only one death occurred in the perioperative period. Thirty-eight patients (46%) had been treated for hypertension for more than 12 months before referral.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Fifty patients (41 men and nine women) less than 36 years of age were evaluated for lower limb ischemia. Claudication was the presenting symptom in 30 patients (60%) and distal ulceration in 20 (40%). The mean age was 28.3 years. Premature atherosclerosis was present in 24 patients (48%) and thromboangiitis obliterans in 12 (24%). Other causes included a variety of unusual etiologies. Risk factors were analyzed. Twenty-two patients with claudication underwent arterial reconstruction; three had sympathectomy. Arterial reconstruction was possible in only three patients with ulceration; 17 had sympathectomy. No operative deaths or early amputations occurred. Follow-up averaged 13.5 years. Twenty-four patients with claudication were improved, three were unchanged, one developed ulceration, one required late amputation, and one was lost to follow-up. Four patients with ulceration were improved, one was unchanged, 14 required late amputation, and one was lost to follow-up. Ten patients, all with atherosclerosis obliterans, developed coronary artery disease; five died of myocardial infarction. No patient developed cerebrovascular disease. We conclude that reconstructive arterial surgery for claudication can be performed with low risk and a strong likelihood of long-term improvement. Most patients presenting with ulceration, however, will ultimately require amputation. Patients with atherosclerosis obliterans are at risk for coronary artery disease and death of myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "The success of aortofemoral reconstruction in patients with superficial femoral artery occlusion depends on the restoration of satisfactory inflow to the profunda femoris artery (PFA). When significant occlusive disease exists within this vessel, two options exist: femoral-distal bypass or reconstruction of the PFA. In 165 aortofemoral reconstructions for occlusive disease, 29 limbs (9%) underwent an extended autogenous profundaplasty. The cumulative 5-year patency rate of autogenous reconstructions was 86%, with a 72% limb salvage rate without distal bypass. Two limbs were amputated early for sepsis with patent grafts. One early and one late femoral-popliteal bypass was performed. Groin wound complications, primarily lymphoceles and wound edge necrosis, were numerous (38%). There were no graft infections. Relief of ischemic symptoms was achieved regardless of patency of the popliteal artery. Furthermore, noninvasive testing, clinical history, and angiography failed to accurately predict the results. In patients with advanced PFA disease undergoing aortofemoral grafting, the extended autogenous profundaplasty is a durable procedure with excellent relief of ischemic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "From October 1978 to June 1983, 64 sequential bypass grafts were performed in 59 patients with limb-threatening ischemia. These patients were classified into three study groups as follows: reversed saphenous vein graft alone (12), composite sequential (proximal polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] and distal vein) graft (30), and PTFE graft in entirety (22). Graft patency was confirmed in all cases by serial Doppler ankle pressure measurements or by angiography. Cumulative life-table patency rates were then compared over a period of 27 months. The patency rates for composite sequential grafts using a distal short segment of vein were statistically indistinguishable from those for bypasses performed entirely with saphenous vein. These yielded a patency rate of 80% at 1 and 2 years. In contrast, the 1- and 2-year patency rates of the PTFE sequential grafts were 52% and 47%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Composite sequential bypasses using an otherwise inadequate segment of saphenous vein are a sound alternative revascularization procedure, with a patency rate comparable to that of reversed saphenous vein bypasses.",

    "abstract": "The human abdominal aorta is particularly susceptible to the formation of aneurysms with atrophic walls. This aortic segment normally has fewer medial lamellar units than would be expected for a mammalian aorta of comparable diameter as well as far fewer medial vasa vasorum than would be expected for an aortic wall of comparable thickness. To test the hypothesis that ischemia and/or loss of normal lamellar architecture are predisposing factors for aneurysm formation, we used the pig thoracic aorta, which is furnished with 75 medial layers and vasa supplying the outer two thirds. Vasal blood flow was surgically ablated, and crushing injury was used to reduce the number of intact lamellar units. Mural ischemia alone resulted in necrosis of cells in the medial zone furnished by vasa but did not lead to aneurysmal dilatation, and all the fibrous tissue layers persisted during the 2-month observation period. Mechanical injury resulted in aneurysms in both ischemic and nonischemic aortic segments, but only if fewer than 40 intact lamellae remained and the average tension per lamellar unit exceeded three times the normal value of 1316 +/- 202 dynes/cm (4543 +/- 1624 for ischemic and 4087 +/- 871 for nonischemic segments; p less than 0.01 for each). We conclude that a critical reduction in the number of intact lamellar units results in aneurysmal dilatation. Protracted medial ischemia due to intimal plaque formation in the avascular abdominal aorta may eventually reduce the number of intact lamellae and favor the development of aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The presence of periprosthetic gas on computerized axial tomography (CT) of the abdomen following abdominal aortic reconstruction has been proposed to be a reliable indicator of prosthetic graft infection, a complication that requires intervention entailing significant mortality and morbidity. To evaluate the reliability of this finding in the early postoperative period, prosthetic grafts in 26 patients undergoing elective aneurysm repair were evaluated with postoperative CT examinations. Serial scans were obtained at mean intervals of 3, 7, and 52 days postoperatively. The presence or absence of periprosthetic air on CT scan was noted, and the results were correlated with aneurysm size as determined by preoperative ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta or by measurements made during operation. Mean aneurysm size was 6.1 cm (range 4.5 to 10.6 cm). Periprosthetic air was demonstrated in 17 (65%) of the 26 patients studied within 1 week postoperatively. Patients with aneurysms larger than 6.0 cm were more likely to demonstrate periprosthetic air then those with smaller aneurysms (chi 2 = 5.024, p = 0.025). All patients found to have periprosthetic air had spontaneous resolution by late CT scanning obtained a mean of 52 days postoperatively (range 21 to 85 days). One patient died in the early postoperative period and two did not return for late scans. Only one patient demonstrated periprosthetic air as late as the thirty-second postoperative day, and this air had resolved by the seventieth postoperative day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Twenty-four atherosclerotic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms were encountered in 21 patients during a 25-year period. These represented 46% of all extracranial carotid artery aneurysms diagnosed at the University of Michigan during this period. Neurologic symptoms including amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attacks, and stroke were present in 50% of the patients. An asymptomatic pulsatile neck mass occurred in 33%. Surgical therapy was undertaken for 18 aneurysms, and nonoperative treatment was pursued in the remaining six aneurysms. Operative therapy included 14 aneurysmectomies and four aneurysmorraphies. There were no surgical deaths. Transient perioperative neurologic deficits affected three of these patients (17%), and one individual (5%) experienced a permanent deficit. Transient cranial nerve deficits occurred in three patients (17%), and a permanent deficit was noted in one patient (5%). During a 7.6-year follow-up period no late strokes occurred among patients who were operated on. Nonoperative therapy was associated with three ipsilateral strokes during a mean follow-up period of 6.3 years. Atherosclerotic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms were associated with an exceptionally high stroke rate (50%) if treated nonoperatively. Prevention of late stroke justifies surgery, although perioperative neurologic deficits may accompany this therapy more often than with nonatherosclerotic carotid artery aneurysms.",

Three degrees of contralateral carotid stenosis were identified radiologically: 0% to 49%, 50% to 99%, and totally occluded. Each group was further separated into two categories according to preoperative symptoms. \"Low risk\" included asymptomatic lesions, transient ischemic attacks, and nonhemispheric symptoms; \"high risk\" described poststroke patients and urgent operations. The results show the incidence of stroke or death was not increased in patients with severely stenosed or occluded contralateral vessels in either low- or high-risk patients (p = 0.741 and p = 0.561, respectively). Patients in the high-risk category, however, had a significantly higher risk of postoperative complications than patients in the low-risk category (p less than 0.001). The study reaffirms that preoperative indications have a major influence on surgical outcome and suggests that the status of the contralateral artery has little bearing on postoperative events.",

    "abstract": "In 1971 this study was undertaken to determine optimal methods and guidelines for lowering the mortality and neurologic complication rates associated with carotid endarterectomy. Of 570 carotid endarterectomies, 481 (84%) were performed under local anesthesia to provide continuous neurologic monitoring and to permit operation on the very elderly and poor-risk patient. In 418 of these procedures carotid stump pressures (CSPs) were measured with patients awake to determine the level of back pressure sufficient for brain protection during operative occlusion. Selective shunting was necessary in 40 (8%) of these cases. Of 78 patients with a CSP of 0 to 25 mm Hg, only 39 (50%) required shunting. Only one patient with a pressure greater than 25 mm Hg (29 mm Hg) needed a shunt. The CSP/brachial blood pressure (BBP) index was calculated for 410 procedures. Of 97 patients with a CSP of 0 to 30 mm Hg, only 31 required a shunt (CSP/BBP index 0.01 to 0.18). No shunt was necessary for an index greater than 0.18. Patients with a contralateral occlusion or severe stenosis required a shunt six times more frequently than those with unilateral disease. For 570 procedures the overall mortality rate was 0.7% and the neurologic complication rate was 0.9%. When local anesthesia was used for 481 procedures, there was only one death (0.2%). For 74 asymptomatic lesions there were no deaths or stroke. Neurologic monitoring under local anesthesia and CSPs are reliable indicators for selective shunting. Multiple-risk factors influence the outcome of carotid endarterectomy, but most can be avoided.",

    "abstract": "An experimental model of acute mesenteric ischemia following 85 minutes of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion in male Wistar rats was used in this investigation. Untreated control animals had a 48-hour survival rate of 38% (n = 26), whereas sham laparotomy resulted in a 100% 48-hour survival rate (n = 10). Study groups received intravenous infusions of normal saline solution (16.6 ml/kg/hr; n = 26) or similar volumes of normal saline solution with the addition of glucagon (1.6 micrograms/kg/min; n = 26), dopamine (3.2 micrograms/kg/min; n = 26), or prostacyclin (PGI2) (10.7 ng/kg/min; n = 26). Infusions were begun 15 minutes after initiating 85 minutes of SMA occlusion and were continued for a total of 90 minutes. Glucagon increased the 48-hour survival rate to 85%, significantly greater than both control survival (p less than 0.001) and normal saline solution group survival rates (p less than 0.025). Neither normal saline solution alone nor dopamine significantly increased the 48-hour survival rate, which was 54% in both groups. The PGI2 group survival rate, 65% at 48 hours, was significantly greater than the control rate (p less than 0.05), was not statistically different from the normal saline solution group survival rate, and was 20% less than the glucagon group survival rate, the latter difference approaching statistical significance (p = 0.10). Methylprednisolone (40 mg/kg; n = 26) administered as an intravenous bolus 15 minutes after initiating SMA occlusion significantly increased the 48-hour survival rate to 73% (p less than 0.01), whereas neither intravenous heparin (150 U/kg; n = 26) nor superoxide dismutase (11,900 U/kg; n = 26) were beneficial. Glucagon, methylprednisolone, and PGI2 improved the survival rate in this model of acute mesenteric ischemia.",

    "abstract": "The ability of real-time B-mode ultrasound to directly visualize arteries and veins and thereby give anatomic rather than physiologic information is unique among the currently available noninvasive methods of vascular evaluation. The usefulness of this technique for examination of the carotid arteries has been well proven. Little attention, however, has been given to its applicability for deep venous evaluation. Over the past 12 months the veins of 108 upper and 215 lower extremities have been studied with high-resolution real-time ultrasound. The technique and interpretive criteria are presented. Thirty extremities underwent confirmatory venography, and in this group the specificity and sensitivity of the ultrasound were 94% and 100%, respectively. In addition, the age of the thrombi detected was accurately predicted in 93% of this group. These preliminary results suggest that real-time B-mode venous ultrasound is an accurate, clinically useful noninvasive technique for the detection of deep venous thrombosis that complements the more widely used physiologic screening tests.",

    "abstract": "There has been recent interest in carotid restenosis following endarterectomy. To evaluate the significance of this complication, 2549 consecutive patients who were evaluated for suspected carotid artery occlusive disease by carotid phonoangiography, ocular plethysmography, and B-mode scanning techniques over a 21-month period were reviewed. Within this group a total of 155 patients had previously undergone a carotid endarterectomy. Of these, only four patients manifested clinically significant restenosis. In the majority of patients the carotid bifurcation was free of significant disease. The \"carotid shelf\" that represents the superior aspect of residual intimal plaque following endarterectomy could be clearly identified in the early postoperative period; however, it later blended to become less distinct. In a few instances, however, the amount of residual plaque at the lower extent of the endarterectomy was very prominent and remained so during follow-up studies, suggesting the possibility that this might represent a focus for future thrombosis. We conclude that noninvasive testing as used herein is an accurate method of assessing the carotid artery following endarterectomy. The accuracy of these techniques has been of such high degree that 16 carefully selected patients have subsequently undergone carotid endarterectomy without preoperative angiography.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the surface thrombogenicities of endothelial cell-seeded small-diameter vascular grafts with those of nonseeded contralateral grafts under conditions of acute controlled low blood flows through the grafts in a canine carotid artery model. Autologous venous endothelial cells seeded in the preclots onto 6 cm sections of 4 mm (internal diameter) double-velour Dacron grafts covered 15% and 80% of graft luminal surfaces at 3 and 5 weeks postsurgically, respectively. Contralateral nonseeded control graft lumina had pannus ingrowth of endothelium across the anastomoses only. There were significant differences in initial carotid graft blood flow rates between seeded and control grafts at both 3 and 5 weeks postsurgically. When blood flow was reduced to 30% of the initial flow levels for 4 hours through these grafts, endothelial cell-seeded grafts maintained patencies and mean blood flow returned to 63.3% and 93% of initial flow levels at 3 and 5 weeks postsurgically, respectively. Few thrombi accumulated. In contrast, thrombi accumulated on nonseeded graft lumina during restricted blood flow. Some nonseeded grafts occluded during low flows, and the ratios of final flow to initial flow were only 28% at 3 weeks and 20% at 5 weeks in these nonseeded grafts. These data demonstrate the efficacy of seeding autologous endothelial cells on small-diameter grafts in this canine model. If technically successful, endothelial cell seeding may provide a protocol for enhancement of the long-term implantation success of small-diameter vascular grafts used for human vascular repair and replacements.",

    "abstract": "The application of microcomputers to vascular surgery has been limited because of the lack of software that allows collection and effective evaluation of a large amount of patient-related data. We have developed a microcomputer-based data handling system for evaluating vascular patients that is inexpensive ($6000 to $8000), easy to use, and flexible. Its simplicity for nonprogrammers is achieved through a natural interface with menu-driven operations and descriptive English language messages. With this system eight data entry forms were designed, and data on more than 1000 patients treated for peripheral vascular disease over the last 7 years were entered into the computer by clerical personnel with minimal training. A query language report generator allowed us to obtain reports of results in simple English on any set of selection criteria with all relevant statistical functions, including cumulative life-table patency rates. This system has the following advantages: rapid evaluation of data from several retrospective and prospective studies, such as comparison of graft material, effect of local and systemic risk factors, cost of limb-salvage surgery, and correlation of noninvasive laboratory tests with other parameters; more accurate patient follow-up, with elimination of many of the pitfalls involved in observing large groups of patients frequently; and quantitation of individual surgeon or service results for quality control and self-review, which guide the vascular surgeon to modify treatment protocols, patient selection, and/or surgical techniques. Wider use of this system for data collection and evaluation will help to standardize data reporting and thus allow accurate comparison of data from different centers.",

After several developments a standard encoding vehicle has been arrived at, and data are entered on light-sensitive cards and processed electronically. This system has been in place for 2 years and has already revealed several trends about the practice of vascular surgery on a large-scale and/or community basis. Of importance among these are the differences in vascular surgical reconstructive success compared with the published individual reports as well as an examination of the trends in vascular surgical practice and the standards of proficiency required. The problems of inertia, resentment, and inaccurate data entry have also been addressed, and steps have been taken to overcome these as well as to ensure security of individual data. It is expected that use of such systems will eventually provide us with a much clearer picture of the overall practice and standards in vascular surgery that apply throughout the nation.",

In acute renal arterial occlusion collateral circulation is often sufficient to maintain kidney viability and subsequent successful revascularization. Because there are no clinical or radiologic criteria to determine salvageability of the kidney, surgical exploration is advised in these patients. Such individuals who undergo successful renal revascularization often have gratifying return of renal function. Axillofemoral-renal bypass is suggested as a method to accomplish this objective.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative angiography in carotid extracranial surgery demonstrates technical defects in 5% to 8% of patients. A simple and safe method of completion contact angiography (CCA) has been perfected by adapting dental x-ray equipment, small dental film cassettes, and a \"shoe box\" type of developing unit. The method is not technician dependent, requires only 5 ml of contrast medium, has a completion time of less than 5 minutes, and produces no measurable radiation to the operating team. CCA was performed with no complications in 40 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Two unsuspected internal carotid artery defects (5%) were discovered: in one a stenosis was immediately repaired, and in the other small thrombi that were seen but not removed were probably the cause of a postoperative transient ischemic attack. Two complete occlusions and one prominent intimal flap in the external carotid artery were also identified. We believe that CCA after carotid surgery should be used routinely because it is safe and simple and reveals unsuspected operative defects that can be corrected immediately.",

    "abstract": "Following distal arterial and venous cannulations in both hind limbs of 10 dogs, left leg arterial pressure was reduced to less than 50 torr (group I) and 50 to 75 torr (group II). Muscle membrane potential difference (PD) measurements, muscle biopsies, and arterial and venous blood samples were taken at baseline, after 3 hours of ischemia, and following 3 hours of reperfusion. Blood gas tensions and blood and muscle metabolites were measured. Muscle creatine phosphate levels fell during the ischemic period, but the adenosine triphosphate concentration remained normal. The PD fell in both groups during ischemia and declined further after reperfusion (p greater than 0.01). The deterioration in cell membrane function occurred in spite of intracellular energy repletion and persisted after reperfusion. The PD appears to be a more sensitive indicator of ischemia-induced cell dysfunction than levels of blood or intracellular metabolites. The cause of the progressive fall in the membrane potential is uncertain, but it may be due to cytotoxicity produced by oxygen free radicals.",

Comparison with an age- and sex-matched population from the same geographic region showed that survival after operation was not impaired unless there were risk factors from disease that was progressive or could not be well controlled. Hypertension and cardiac disease did not adversely affect survival-probably because they were generally well controlled and included the use of nonsynchronous coronary artery grafting when necessary. Those with impaired cardiac function severe enough to threaten perioperative myocardial infarction or acute irreversible cardiac failure during anesthesia were not recommended for operation.",

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction may develop severe thigh pain and a sensation of tightness with vigorous exercise (venous claudication). The discomfort requires 15 to 20 minutes to subside. In the seven patients studied the venous capacitance (VC) and venous outflow (VO) are lower than those of the unaffected limb even at rest. With exercise to the point of pain, the VO was unchanged but the VC decreased even further. The problem appears to rest with the venous collaterals, which have a high and fixed resistance. Because of this high outflow resistance, venous volume increases to near maximum during exercise. With this rise in venous volume, the amount the VC can increase during the period immediately following exercise is further reduced.",

    "abstract": "Mycotic aneurysms are a fulminant infectious process frequently resulting in rupture and death if not properly treated. A review of the University of California, Los Angeles, medical records identified 10 patients with extrathoracic, extracranial mycotic aneurysms. In addition, a search of the English literature revealed 178 patients with 243 mycotic aneurysms. These patients were reviewed to identify the aneurysm location, etiology, bacteriology, and modality of treatment in order to determine the relationship between these factors and the outcome. The femoral artery was the most common site (38%), followed by the abdominal aorta (31%). Arterial trauma was the primary etiology in 42% of mycotic aneurysms. In 25% no clear source of infection could be identified. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from 28% of mycotic aneurysms, and Salmonella from 15%. A trend toward the involvement of more gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes is noted. Aortic aneurysms were repaired with in situ Dacron in 61% of patients with a 32% mortality rate and 16% reinfection rate. Simple ligation of femoral artery mycotic aneurysms resulted in a 34% incidence of ischemia necessitating amputation. Methods of treatment of superior mesenteric, carotid, iliac, and peripheral arteries are also analyzed. On the basis of these data, specific surgical procedures are recommended for the treatment of mycotic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Late failure of synthetic vascular grafts to small-diameter arteries (less than or equal to 4 mm) is commonly due to anastomotic hyperplasia. Theoretic analysis suggests that conformational changes at the anastomosis lead to high localized arterial wall stress caused by increases in radius of curvature of the artery (law of Laplace: tension = pressure X radius). Nine 3 kg rabbits had a plastic insert implanted into the infrarenal aorta. The insert was designed to recreate the conformational changes caused by the anastomosis of a synthetic graft to a small-diameter artery, without significantly altering blood flow. The increase in arterial wall tension created by the insert was calculated to be 80% to 100% over baseline values. Aortography, real-time ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) scanning were done to confirm the absence of luminal thrombus formation or migration of the insert. Ultrasound and CT scans also confirmed the desired conformational changes in the aorta at the site of the insert. Aortas, with the inserts in place, were removed from 3 days to 6 months after implantation. Implantation times of 1 to 6 months resulted in a hyperplastic subintimal lesion characterized by fibrous tissue deposition, spindle cells (which may have been fibroblasts), and/or smooth muscle cells covered by endothelium. In contrast, two rabbits that had the insert placed and then removed at 1 minute and were allowed to survive for 37 and 72 days, respectively, demonstrated complete healing of the aorta without anastomotic hyperplasia. The arterial wall conformational changes induced in this experiment led to the formation of a lesion consistent with anastomotic hyperplasia. An increase in wall tension may have been the stimulus for this response. Prevention of anastomotic hyperplasia may require a means of uniting a graft to an artery without increasing wall tension.",

    "abstract": "The LaPlace transform damping (LTD) method of common femoral artery Doppler waveform analysis is a new method for assessing aortoiliac stenosis. A microcomputer was used to analyze the waveform to determine the value of the damping parameter, which is related to inflow stenosis. The study included 60 limbs with arterial disease and 20 limbs in normal control subjects. With a damping value of 0.60 used as the cutoff point between nonocclusive lesions and iliac stenoses of greater than 50% diameter reduction, we found a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93% (overall accuracy 95%). Unlike Doppler waveform analysis by the pulsatility index method, the accuracy of the LTD method is not affected by occlusion of the superficial femoral artery. The Doppler signal processor and the computer currently used for the LTD analysis are simple to operate and fully suitable for routine use in a clinical vascular laboratory. Our experience indicates that the LTD method of waveform analysis provides the best noninvasive method for detection of significant inflow disease.",

    "abstract": "From August 1972 to September 1982, one of us (F.R.P.) performed 119 femorofemoral bypass grafts on 78 men and 35 women with an average age of 62 years. Axillofemorofemoral grafts were excluded. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 1.7% (2 of 119). The cumulative patency rates determined by the life-table method were 97.4% at 30 days, 95.1% at 1 year, 83.3% at 3 years, 72.2% at 5 years, and 55% from 6 through 10 years. There were no graft failures in the 21 patients followed up for more than 6 years. There were 21 grafts at risk at 7 years, 15 at 8 years, 10 at 9 years, and four at 10 years. Donor iliac arteries were judged to be acceptable by a combination of simple analyses including physical examination, noninvasive laboratory testing, angiography, and intraoperative direct blood pressure measurements. There was no evidence of a vascular steal in any of the postoperative patients. One patient required an inflow procedure 2 years following femorofemoral grafting. Two patients required resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm 2 and 3 years, respectively, following femorofemoral grafting. There was one early graft failure secondary to infection, and five grafts became infected at 20,29,33,46, and 62 months, respectively, following femorofemoral grafting. False aneurysm formation, diabetes, and trauma were significant factors in these infections. Initially only high-risk patients were selected as candidates for femorofemoral grafting. Because we were encouraged by the early success rate and the apparent durability of the method, the indications were broadened to include good-risk patients who met rigid criteria for femorofemoral grafting.",

    "abstract": "Recent biochemical evidence that aneurysm formation may be related to higher activated collagenase levels within aneurysmal aortic walls in association with reports of asymptomatic aneurysm rupture after laparotomy has led to speculation that operative trauma unrelated to direct aortic injury may increase the chance of aneurysm rupture by inducing collagenase activation within the aortic wall. The purpose of this study was to determine whether aortic collagenase can be activated by distant operative trauma and the kinetics of activation after injury. Ninety-six rats were divided into four groups: group 1--laparotomy alone; group 2--cecal resection; group 3--aortic mobilization; and group 4--aortotomy and repair. Animals within each group were sacrificed 1,3, and 6 hours and 1,2,3,4, and 5 days after surgery. The abdominal aortas were removed and assayed for collagenase activity by incubation with and digestion of tritium-labeled collagen. Collagenase activity was significantly elevated up to 6 hours after direct aortic injury (p less than 0.05) and decreased to normal levels within 2 days. Laparotomy, colon resection, and aortic mobilization had no significant effect on aortic collagenase activity compared to the controls. These data suggest that collagenase activity is a local phenomenon related to wound healing at the site of initial injury. Operative trauma without direct aortic injury had no effect on aortic collagenase activity.",

    "abstract": "One hundred thirty patients underwent low-dose, catheter-directed fibrinolytic therapy for arterial and graft occlusions present for various periods of time. In 65 consecutive patients the therapeutic parameters were identical, and a careful hematologic evaluation was performed. In the subsequent 65 patients, varying doses of fibrinolytic agents were employed. Fibrinolytic therapy was found to be beneficial in a diverse group of clinical situations and in patients whose occlusions had occurred at varying lengths of time. Early study demonstrated that effective fibrinolysis can be achieved at approximately one-twentieth of the systemic level and that systemic effects could be avoided in all patients during 24-hour infusions and in many patients infused up to 96 hours. Bleeding complications occurred only in patients in whom concomitant heparinization was employed, and this was thought to be the causative factor. Therapeutic success and avoiding complications are strongly dependent on close monitoring of patients and joint decision making by the vascular surgeon and radiologist.",

Recently, a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft with external rigid spiral supports was developed that appeared particularly applicable to the venous system. In 18 dogs a 15 cm length of Impraflex was placed from the proximal right common iliac vein to the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the level of the renal veins after IVC and right iliac vein interruption. End-to-end and end-to-side iliac vein anastomoses were alternated, with and without distal femoral arteriovenous (AV) fistulas (AVFs). At 2 months, with a distal AV fistula, 11 of 12 (92%) grafts were patent, angiograms demonstrated no evidence of intraluminal clot, and there was no hind limb edema. Following AVF ligation 2 months after graft insertion, 10 grafts remained patent, but five developed some intraluminal thrombus and one of them progressed to complete occlusion. Four months after fistula ligation (6 months after graft insertion) 9 of 12 grafts (75%) remained patent. All six grafts without distal AVF were occluded within 1 week. This procedure was performed on one severely symptomatic patient who had IVC occlusion, and currently the patient shows marked improvement. Thus IVC bypass is possible when an externally supported PTFE prosthesis is complemented by a temporary AVF.",

However, the association of cholelithiasis with cholecystitis is well established and was observed in a group of patients who had known cholelithiasis following aortic reconstruction. Cholelithiasis was noted in 50 of 250 patients who underwent reconstruction of the abdominal aorta or its major branches. Seventeen of the 50 patients with cholelithiasis underwent a cholecystectomy prior to aortic reconstruction. Sixteen patients underwent a cholecystectomy at the time of aortic reconstruction and experienced no morbidity related to the cholecystectomy. Seventeen patients with cholelithiasis did not undergo cholecystectomy. All were asymptomatic. Nine of these individuals developed cholecystitis or symptoms related to their gallstones following aortic reconstruction. A subsequent cholecystectomy was performed in all nine patients. The interval between aortic reconstruction and cholecystectomy was from 2 weeks to 108 months. The remaining eight patients with cholelithiasis have been followed up for 17 to 50 months. Six of these patients remain asymptomatic. The two patients followed up for the longest period (42 and 50 months, respectively) have become symptomatic. If there are no mitigating circumstances, cholecystectomy is advised for patients undergoing aortic reconstruction with associated cholelithiasis.",

    "abstract": "The repeated failure of forearm hemodialysis access grafts in patients with end-stage renal failure often requires the use of an upper arm graft fistula. During a 7-year period, 20 upper arm graft fistulas were placed in 15 patients. The 5-year patency rate by life-table analysis, including graft fistula salvage by thrombectomy, is 53%. The mean survival from graft insertion until revision or thrombectomy is 36 months. Twenty of the twenty-two thrombectomies performed (91%) were successful in reestablishing graft fistula patency. Six grafts required more than one thrombectomy, and seven grafts required revision of the venous anastomosis. Only one arterial anastomosis required revision. We conclude that the upper arm graft fistula is an acceptable method of hemodialysis access in those patients without suitable forearm access sites. However, an aggressive approach to both graft fistula thrombectomy and the revision of stenotic anastomoses is necessary to maintain a satisfactory patency rate.",

    "abstract": "A study was made of 53 patients who underwent amputation for peripheral vascular disease over a 5-year period at West Virginia University Medical Center. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 6 years. Data concerning operative deaths, risk factors, use of prosthetic devices, and ultimate self-sufficient living were obtained. The functional outcome for this group of patients was encouraging with modern prosthetic fitting and social rehabilitation. Approximately 75% of the patients were returned to a useful life with a prosthetic limb or in a wheelchair. Amputation is a less desirable alternative than successful revascularization, but with the prostheses available today, amputation does not foreshadow a dismal existence.",

    "abstract": "Subclavian steal syndrome may result from stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. The diagnosis can be confirmed by noninvasive vascular studies with the use of a directional Doppler probe or by time-sequence aortic arch angiography, both of which can detect retrograde flow in the vertebral artery. A variety of surgical approaches to this condition have been used in the past, but the simpler and much safer carotid-to-subclavian bypass has become a more acceptable surgical procedure. There remains, however, a theoretical possibility that blood may be siphoned from the intracranial arteries perfused by the carotid. This phenomenon, which may be called the carotid steal syndrome, has been discussed, but no clinical cases have been reported. We present a patient who developed such a carotid steal syndrome 2 years after left carotid-subclavian bypass. This occurrence reemphasizes the importance of determining a normal carotid bifurcation prior to performing carotid-subclavian bypass.",

    "abstract": "To assess the safety of percutaneous puncture for the angiographic study of aortofemoral bypass grafts, we reviewed the medical records of 58 patients who underwent a total of 86 graft punctures. Short- and long-term follow-up revealed that in 83 punctures there were no complications. In three instances (3.5%) there was acute thrombosis of the punctured limb of the graft. This complication may have expedited but did not substantially alter the surgical plans of managing the underlying clinical problem. Although the incidence of complications of direct graft puncture is higher than that associated with puncture of native vessels, alternative approaches are also associated with complications, many of which may be more serious. Therefore, for angiographic studies of patients with aortofemoral bypass grafts, we favor the direct percutaneous puncture provided that enough time has elapsed from surgery.",

    "abstract": "Central to the use of fluorescein in vascular diagnosis is the requirement that the intensity of evoked fluorescence be proportional to blood flow. With the introduction of the digital dermofluorometer, a device that quantitates cutaneous fluorescence, establishment of this relationship has become possible. After experimentally producing measured reductions in the distal aortic flow of eight rabbits, the ratio of fluorescence in the flow-restricted and unrestricted areas was obtained by measuring hind- and forelimb fluorescence. At any time between 20 and 60 minutes following a bolus injection of sodium fluorescein (1 mg/kg body weight), there was a significant linear relationship (p less than 0.05, r greater than 0.75) between residual aortic flow and the ratio of hind-/forelimb fluorescence. Simultaneously obtained plasma fluorescein concentrations decayed rapidly by first-order kinetics with a half-life of 12.5 minutes, regardless of the degree of distal aortic occlusion. The time course of the rise and fall of cutaneous fluorescence was slower than that of the plasma fluorescein concentration, proving that interstitial rather than intravascular fluorescein was responsible for the measured fluorescence. We conclude that the intensity of tissue fluorescence is linearly related to blood flow and that conclusions regarding perfusion may be drawn from relative fluorescence at any time between 20 and 60 minutes following a bolus injection of fluorescein. Furthermore, the passage of fluorescein into the interstitium is dependent on a time-limited diffusion process, which along with flow, establishes the time to peak and the absolute amplitude of the tissue fluorescence curve.",

    "abstract": "A method for assessing peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was developed from the pattern of transcutaneous oxygen (PtcO2) changes after temporary limb ischemia induced by pneumatic blood pressure cuff occlusion. The transcutaneous oxygen recovery half-time (TORT) was defined as the time required to recover half of the decrease in the limb/chest PtcO2 ratio produced by temporary limb ischemia. TORT was examined in subjects with and without significant PVD. Patients who underwent operative therapy for symptomatic PVD were studied before and after operation. Comparison was also made of the values of patients in whom therapy was successful in resolving symptoms vs. those in whom it was not. TORT was found to improve the diagnostic accuracy of PtcO2 measurements to differentiate normal vs. PVD limbs and successful vs. unsuccessful results of therapy. Normal subjects uniformly had TORT values less than or equal to 1.5 minutes at both calf and foot positions; limbs with symptomatic PVD consistently had TORT values that were significantly longer in duration (p less than 0.001). Limbs with PVD that received successful therapy had a significant improvement in calf and foot TORT values after surgery (p less than 0.01); postoperative values were usually slightly longer than those of normal subjects, probably reflecting some residual disease. Postoperatively, limbs with PVD that had received unsuccessful therapy either had only slight improvement or worsening of their TORT values, which were significantly greater than the TORT values of limbs that received successful therapy (p less than 0.001). We conclude that measurement of postocclusive TORT is a reliable method for diagnosing PVD and for quantitatively evaluating residual disease after operative therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study was carried out to determine whether we could develop a model to identify predictive factors for success of femoral-popliteal (FP) bypass grafts. In a retrospective review of 199 operations, 24 factors influencing outcome were selected by stepwise logistic regression analysis, a sophisticated, multifactorial computer program. The top five indicators (excluding intraoperative technical problems) were runoff status, previous ipsilateral FP bypass, preoperative prediction of potential amputation level, concurrent proximal vascular reconstruction, and site of the distal anastomosis. We chose to validate the predictive model developed before applying it clinically. Data from 67 subsequent cases were presented to the computer without the known outcome, and the probability of 30-day patency was calculated. The model predicted 11 failures; there were actually eight thromboses in the 67 grafts. However, only three of the failures were predicted correctly, and eight cases of computer-anticipated thromboses were patent at 30 days. The high false positive rate makes the clinical application of the predictive model inappropriate. The success of FP bypass grafts appears to be related to factors that cannot be assessed preoperatively, such as technical problems during surgery. Even those which seem to have a poor runoff and other high-risk factors may succeed; thus an aggressive approach is justified in lower extremity reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "Although the results of coronary artery bypass surgery have been excellent, recent studies have demonstrated transient alterations in myocardial function and metabolism in spite of apparently adequate cardioplegic protection. Blood cardioplegia may provide better protection than crystalloid cardioplegia, but clinical studies remain inconclusive. Critical coronary stenoses limit cardioplegic delivery, and myocardial protection would be improved with either blood or crystalloid cardioplegia if the solution could be delivered beyond the coronary stenosis. The construction of proximal as well as distal anastomoses during a prolonged cross-clamp period permits more uniform cardioplegic delivery and immediate reperfusion when the cross clamp is released. This technique was used in a prospective randomized trial comparing blood and crystalloid cardioplegia. The long cross-clamp technique eliminated temperature gradients induced when cardioplegia was delivered into the aortic root. The technique of cardioplegic delivery may be as important as the solution used for cardioplegic protection.",

    "abstract": "The cause of hypertension in the immediate postoperative period after carotid endarterectomy is unknown. In order to elucidate the etiology of hypertension following carotid endarterectomy, blood samples were drawn intraoperatively from internal jugular vein and external carotid artery prior to and subsequent to carotid endarterectomy in 20 patients. Renin measurement in these samples produced a ratio of internal jugular vein (cerebral) to external carotid artery (systemic). In pre-endarterectomy samples, this cerebral-to-systemic ratio was 1.0 +/- 0.17. However, in the six patients hypertensive postoperatively, this ratio was significantly (p less than 0.02) higher at 1.39 +/- 0.4 than in 14 patients not hypertensive, 0.99 +/- 0.28. Although this ratio in hypertensive patients reverted to 1.12 +/- 0.24 in the postoperative period, the present study suggests a relation between hypertension after carotid endarterectomy and renin production by the brain.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative pulmonary embolism continues to be a problem in patient care, especially in high-risk patients. This study was designed to evaluate a combined pharmacologic approach to the prophylaxis of postoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by mediating at least two and probably three of Virchow's predisposing factors. Patients 40 years of age and older undergoing operations greater than 45 minutes under general anesthesia were placed in one of five treatment groups and studied by a prospective randomized, double-blind protocol. Study drugs were the following: (1) 0.5 mg of dihydroergotamine plus 5000 IU of sodium heparin (DHE 5000), (2) 0.5 mg DHE plus 2500 IU heparin (DHE 2500), (3) 5000 IU of HEP (HEP 5000), (4) 0.5 mg of DHE (DHE 0.5), and (5) a placebo. Study medications were administered 2 hours preoperatively and continuously thereafter every 12 hours postoperatively subcutaneously in the anterior abdominal wall for 5 to 7 days or until a positive radiofibrinogen uptake test (RFUT). The RFUT was performed according to standardized technique and was used to establish the presence or absence of DVT. This report is an analysis of the major subgroup of patients undergoing intra-abdominal operations. Results showed a highly statistically significant prophylactic benefit from DHE 5000 compared with the placebo (p less than 0.003) and all other treatment groups (p less than 0.05). There was no significant benefit from DHE 2500, HEP 5000 (p greater than 0.13), and DHE 0.5 (p greater than 0.3). All patients who entered the study had two or more risk factors for postoperative DVT, and high-risk patients were distributed equally throughout all treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Four hundred ninety-five patients undergoing peripheral arterial percutaneous transluminal dilatation (TLD) with the Gruntzig balloon catheter were studied prospectively to determine which factors could be used to predict a successful result from the procedure. Ten variables were recorded before the TLD. The procedure was considered a success at follow-up if both the clinical grade and the objective vascular laboratory results improved. The results of a logistic discriminant function analysis showed that three variables were associated with success of a TLD at 3 months: the site of the TLD, the severity of the lesion (i.e., stenosis or occlusion), and the runoff. With these results, logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the chances of a successful result for all combinations of these significant variables. It is concluded that the early result of a TLD is determined by the site of the TLD, the severity of the lesion, and the runoff. A table of the estimated chances of success for any combination of these variables has been constructed and accurately describes our patient population.",

    "abstract": "Between 1970 and 1982, 126 inferior vena cava (IVC) balloon occlusions were performed for complications of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Forty, or 32%, were in patients with cancer. There were 20 men and 20 women. The average age was 60.8 +/- 2 years. Cancers of the brain, lung, and breast, along with diffuse metastatic disease with unknown primary disease, were equally common and represented 50% of our cases. Indications for IVC occlusion included pulmonary embolus despite anticoagulation (AC); 50% VTE and contraindication to AC, 38%; and complications of AC, 12%. Three patients died from ongoing complications of previous AC. Eight additional patients died of cancer, for a hospital mortality rate of 28%. Twenty-nine patients were discharged an average of 28.4 +/- 4.3 days after IVC balloon occlusion. Twenty of these patients subsequently died of cancer an average of 13 +/- 4.7 months after hospital discharge. Eight patients remain alive, four for more than 4 years. Pulmonary emboli did not occur after balloon occlusion, and there were no balloon complications. Only 4 of 29 discharged patients had mild leg edema. Hunter balloon occlusion of the IVC represents a safe and effective method for managing complications of VTE in patients with cancer. Early hospital discharge is possible, treatment is permanent, and future chemotherapy is not compromised by the need for long-term anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "From 1977 to 1984, 752 reconstructions of the supra-aortic arteries were performed at our service. In a group of 31 patients presenting with transient ischemic attacks (13) or minor strokes (15), preoperative multiplane angiograms identified lesions from various causes in extremely high locations (fibromuscular dysplasia, 10; atherosclerosis, 6; traumatic changes, 10; spontaneous dissection, 3; and mycotic aneurysms and others, 4) in 34 internal carotid arteries (aneurysms, 10; and stenosis, 24). Surgery was performed on 30 patients. Flow restoration was achieved by resection and vein graft replacement (20), gradual dilatation (5), thromboendarterectomy (6), and tangential clip for exclusion of a lateral aneurysm (1). Only one patient was treated with an extracranial-intracranial anastomosis because the stenosis extended into the carotid siphon. One patient was treated with heparin. Exposure of the internal carotid artery (ICA) at the base of the skull required dissection of the digastric muscle, careful mobilization of the cranial nerves, and detachment of the styloid process in 29 patients. Partial resection of the mastoid process was helpful in two patients. The carotid bone canal was opened from the lateral side in four cases to allow the most distal anastomosis 1 cm within the carotid canal. Back-bleeding was controlled by a balloon catheter. A shunt was impossible to use and clamping time averaged 62 +/- 40 minutes. Except for one recurrent stroke and two transient ischemic attacks no other neurologic deficits occurred. Cranial nerve damage could not be avoided in 21 cases (nervus recurrens, 7; nervus glossopharyngeus, 16; and nervus facialis, 4) but disappeared clinically within a 1- to 6-month period in all but two. Each surgical patient underwent control angiography, which demonstrated 30 arteries to be patent, two became occluded, and one had an insignificant stenosis. We conclude that standard surgical techniques are unsuitable for repair of highly located lesions of the ICA. Although extracranial-intracranial anastomosis has been proposed in patients with planned ligation of the ICA, the anatomic reconstruction remains advantageous because flow is restored to normal and the source of emboli is eliminated. With the use of a special approach, graft replacement can be performed up to the base of the skull.",

    "abstract": "Localized obstruction in a suprarenal aorta of normal diameter is rare. Between 1970 and 1983, nine patients (all women, mean age 51 years) required aortic reconstruction to relieve severe lower extremity ischemia (nine patients), hypertension (nine), visceral ischemia (two), and congestive heart failure (three) caused by an eccentric, heavily calcified polypoid lesion originating from the posterior surface of the suprarenal aorta. This mass typically began at the level of the diaphragm and extended to the level of the renal arteries, almost totally occluding the aortic lumen. The rock-hard, irregular, gritty, whitish surface strongly resembled a coral reef. Elective revascularization was carried out in eight patients, and an emergency procedure was necessary in one patient who had acute aortic thrombosis with catastrophic visceral, renal, and lower extremity ischemia. The suprarenal atheroma was removed en bloc through a retroperitoneal thoracoabdominal aortic endarterectomy. Concomitant aortoiliofemoral revascularization was necessary in seven patients (five prosthetic grafts, two endarterectomies). Two patients died postoperatively. The seven long-term survivors remain asymptomatic at a mean follow-up interval of 4 years after revascularization, without evidence of recurrence of this lesion. Suprarenal \"coral reef\" atherosclerosis should be considered if visceral, renal, and limb ischemia is not adequately explained by the arteriographic pattern of conventional atherosclerosis. This unusual atheroma exhibited extensive calcification and metaplastic bone formation, although its precise pathophysiology remains to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Antithrombin III (AT-III) deficiency has been associated with increased risk of venous and arterial thromboses and arterial graft failure. Deficiency of this circulating glycoprotein may be congenital; however, acquired deficiencies may develop in protein-losing or protein-wasting states. In the present study, AT-III levels of 108 patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures were determined preoperatively and at intervals (third, fifth, and seventh days) postoperatively. The mean AT-III level was then compared to the patient's protein status. The effect of reduced AT-III activity on early graft failure was also noted. A low preoperative AT-III level (less than 80%) was found in 16.3% of the patients studied. Among 83 patients with serum albumin levels greater than 3.0 gm/dl or transferrin levels greater than 180 mg/dl, reduced AT-III activity was present in only 10 (12%). In contrast, when serum albumin levels were less than 3.0 gm/dl, AT-III deficiency was found in 12 of 25 patients (48%) (p less than 0.01). Early thrombosis of a femorodistal graft occurred in 5 of 15 patients (33%) with reduced AT-III levels. When AT-III levels were normal, early bypass failure occurred in only 9 of 67 grafts (13.4%). However, this difference was not statistically significant. An additional 15 patients had sequential pre- and postoperative measurements (up to 3 weeks) of serum protein and AT-III levels to illustrate the relationship between the dynamics of protein metabolism and AT-III levels. There was a clear temporal relationship between albumin, transferrin, and AT-III levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the impact of routine arteriography on the management of 105 patients with penetrating injuries to the neck and upper chest. Of 72 patients with bullet wounds and 33 with knife wounds, surgical exploration on an emergency basis was performed in three patients because of shock; the remaining 102 underwent aortic arch or selective arteriography. Surgical exploration was performed in 18 patients because of abnormal arteriograms and in 13 (10 with normal arteriograms) because of shock or suspected hemorrhage. Operative findings confirmed the angiographic interpretation in 26 of the 31 patients who were explored. The angiogram underestimated the arterial injury in two patients and failed to identify an associated venous injury in three. Seventy-two patients with negative arteriograms received expectant treatment without subsequent complications. Routine arteriography is integral to expeditious triage and accurate diagnosis of patients with brachiocephalic trauma. A negative study in almost 80% of patients permits safe nonoperative management, whereas a positive study allows the surgeon to plan his operative approach more judiciously. Endoscopic procedures are important adjuncts in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Although the laser has been demonstrated to vaporize coronary artery plaque, there is little information about its ability to resect or vaporize the range of plaques present in peripheral vessels. This study attempts to determine the ability of the argon laser to resect all grades of atherosclerotic plaque, the risk of perforation during plaque resection, the effects on surrounding arteries, and the effect of different transmission media (air, saline solution, and blood) on the delivery of laser energy to the vessel. Seventy-five adult human cadaveric aortic specimens with a range of atherosclerosis from grossly normal artery to extensive calcification with ulceration were exposed to variable energy densities (200 to greater than 20,000 J/cm2) within 48 hours of harvesting. Specimens were examined grossly for the visual effects of laser and microscopically after preparation with hematoxylin-eosin, trichrome, and/or Verhoeff's elastin stains. Our results indicate that normal arteries and noncalcified plaques absorb laser energy and are vaporized. As the atherosclerosis becomes more complex with calcification, calcified regions are not vaporized and cannot be resected. In normal arteries and noncalcified plaque, perforation times were less than 5 seconds. Where palpable calcification was present in atherosclerotic lesions, average perforation time was doubled. In some vessels areas of calcification prevented wall perforation, but areas of subintimal hemorrhage perforated rapidly because of the selective absorption of laser energy by the red color of hemorrhagic tissue. These results remain the same when saline solution is used as a transmission media, although the amount of energy required to achieve the effects is increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We have used a simple reproducible method to measure total outflow resistance (OR) and its proximal and distal components in 101 bypasses (46 femoropopliteal [FP] and 55 femorodistal [FD]). All bypasses with a distal OR greater than 1.2 mm Hg/ml/min failed within 3 months and all with distal OR less than 1.2 mm Hg/ml/min remained patent for at least 3 months. To evaluate the contribution of vasospasm to OR and its role in graft failure, 60 bypasses (29 FP, 31 FD) had OR measurements before and after local infusion of papaverine hydrochloride (60 mg). Within 3 months, nine grafts (all FD) occluded and 51 remained patent. All nine failures had distal OR greater than 1.2 mm Hg/ml/min before papaverine infusion. After infusion, the mean percentage decrease in both total and distal OR for all grafts was 30% and 31%, respectively. However, there was no significant difference between these papaverine-induced decreases in OR and 3-month graft failure or success. Moreover, in three bypasses, even though papaverine lowered the distal OR from greater than 1.2 to less than 1.2 mm Hg/ml/min, early occlusion occurred. In six grafts (1 FP, 5 FD) when total and distal OR before and after papaverine was greater than 1.2 mm Hg/ml/min, the graft was extended to a second distal artery as a sequential bypass. These six grafts have remained patent over 3 months. Thus measurement of OR and particularly distal OR is a most accurate predictor of early graft success or failure. Pharmacologic manipulation does not enhance the predictive value of the OR measurement. OR measurements also help to select those FD bypass cases in which extension to a second distal artery as a sequential bypass improves patency.",

    "abstract": "In general the surgical literature has expressed pessimism about the value of bypass to the peroneal artery for limb salvage. The combination of greater technical difficulty, low patency rates, and hemodynamic failures have led to the establishment of this prejudice. In a review of 284 arteriograms in limbs with infrapopliteal arterial occlusion, the peroneal artery was the least diseased in 40% and was the only available vessel in 37% of instances. One hundred fifty-two peroneal bypasses have been performed in a 7-year period, 116 by the in situ method, 23 with excised vein, and 13 by nonautogenous conduits. During the same period 125 anterior tibial and 114 posterior tibial bypasses were also done. The mean preoperative ankle/brachial indices were 0.27 for peroneal, 0.25 for anterior tibial, and 0.29 for posterior tibial bypasses. These were converted to mean postoperative indices of 0.84, 0.86, and 0.92, respectively. Corresponding transmetatarsal/brachial indices were 0.72, 0.75, and 0.90. Rest pain was relieved in all these patients, and in 94 patients with tissue loss, there were 11 major amputations, nine healed forefoot amputations, and 20 healed digital ray amputations. Hemodynamic failures were two in the peroneal, two in the anterior tibial, and three in the posterior tibial group with one perioperative amputation in each. The cumulative limb salvage rate at 3 years for the peroneal group was 81%. This experience has shown that the patency and limb salvage rates obtained are comparable to those for the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and that hemodynamic failure is an uncommon occurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Patients who have sustained a large hemispheric stroke are not candidates for early carotid endarterectomy, but there is less agreement regarding the role of carotid endarterectomy in patients with small, fixed neurologic deficits. Accepted practice in many centers is to wait 4 to 6 weeks after the onset of the deficit before proceeding with carotid endarterectomy because of the fear that early revascularization will increase the size of the infarct. Earlier endarterectomy, however, in patients with significant residual ipsilateral carotid territory at risk may prevent repeated infarctions. For the past 5 years our approach to patients with a small stable stroke and significant stenosis (greater than 75%) has been prompt ipsilateral endarterectomy. Of the 337 carotid endarterectomies at our institution since 1979, a subset of 28 patients with hemodynamically significant carotid lesions presented with a small, fixed stroke. The period of time between the appearance of the stroke and carotid endarterectomy averaged 11 days, but 53% of patients were operated on within 7 days of the onset of symptoms. Selective shunting based on intraoperative EEG monitoring was utilized and 40% of the 28 patients required shunts. Operative mortality consisted of one death from a pulmonary embolus, and no patient sustained a new postoperative deficit. Long-term follow-up was available for 96% of patients over a mean of 2 years. During this time two new neurologic events occurred: one fatal stroke and one transient deficit. This experience indicates that patients with small, fixed neurologic deficits who continue to have carotid territory at risk may safely undergo carotid endarterectomy without waiting 4 to 6 weeks.",

Following carotid endarterectomy in 65 patients, specimens were examined for the presence of ulceration without knowing the result of the preoperative CT brain scan. The 65 patients thus investigated underwent 68 carotid endarterectomies: 36 for a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), 13 for amaurosis fugax, and six for prior strokes; 13 asymptomatic patients had prophylactic carotid endarterectomy prior to coronary bypass. A macroscopic ulcer was present in 42 specimens. Twenty-six (62%) of the patients with ulceration had one or more ipsilateral cerebral infarcts on CT scan. Only two (8%) of the 26 patients without an ulcer had cerebral infarcts. Of the 36 patients who presented with TIAs, 26 (72%) had carotid plaque ulcers and 23 (88%) of these had cerebral infarcts on CT scan also. In contrast, only three of 13 asymptomatic patients had plaque ulcers and only one of these had a cerebral infarct. There is a high incidence of cerebral infarction seen on CT scan in patients presenting with TIAs. These infarcts occur predominantly in patients with ulcerated atheromatous carotid lesions.",

At the time of arteriography, 93 hemispheres were asymptomatic regarding the hemisphere with siphon stenosis (group I), whereas 22 hemispheres in 22 patients had had neurologic events referable to the hemisphere with siphon stenosis (group II). During follow-up (range 1 to 62 months, mean 22.5 months), 64.5% of initially asymptomatic hemispheres remained asymptomatic, 6.5% experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and 4.3% developed strokes. During the same follow-up period, 63.6% of initially symptomatic hemispheres became asymptomatic, 9.1% had recurrence of TIAs, and 9.1% developed strokes. Sixteen of 71 group I patients (22.5%) and 5 of 22 group II patients (22.7%) died during follow-up. The overall incidence of nonfatal stroke and TIAs was 6.5% and 8.6%, respectively. Myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke accounted for deaths in 6.5% and 4.3% of patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of TIA, stroke, or death between group I and group II. The percentage of siphon stenosis in all patients experiencing stroke or TIA (35.4 +/- 14.4%) was not significantly different from that in patients who remained asymptomatic (32.3 +/- 10.6%). Patients with carotid siphon stenosis are at an increased risk of death, stroke, and TIAs compared with the population at large. However, the risk of stroke is less than the risk of stroke in patients with TIAs assumed to be caused by carotid bifurcation disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Twenty-four patients with internal carotid artery lesions extending above the second cervical vertebra underwent mandibular subluxation for additional exposure. The original technique of bilateral arch bar wiring requiring 90 minutes for application has evolved into a circummandibular/transnasal wiring technique requiring approximately 10 minutes. Subluxation of the mandibular condyle 10 to 15 mm anteriorly results in displacement of the mandibular ramus 20 to 30 mm anteriorly. This technique provides a marked increase in exposure of the internal carotid artery up to the base of the skull by transforming a triangular operating field into a rectangular field. The technique is quick, easy to perform, and not associated with objective or subjective temporomandibular joint dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to culture human adult endothelial cells (HAECs) on a long-term basis in the laboratory. Previous inability to accomplish this has been the major impediment to the in vitro study of endothelialization of prosthetic grafts with human cells, a problem of significant clinical relevance. We have been successful in developing a technique that allows HAECs from human adult arteries, veins, and capillaries to proliferate vigorously in culture for up to 80 population doublings. HAECs are grown on a gelatin surface (medium 199 containing 20% fetal calf serum). Heparin and endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) are required for optimal growth. With this technique, which will be described in detail, over 10(23) HAECs can be produced from each 1 cm2 of vascular tissue. This makes large numbers of HAECs available for high-density seeding on prosthetic grafts prior to implantation. It also permits for the first time with human cells the in vitro study of prosthetic grafts--HAEC interactions and the factors that enhance optimal growth and adherence to prosthetic materials. It is hoped that identification of the factors promoting graft endothelialization in combination with high-density seeding will lower graft thrombogenicity and therefore result in greater graft longevity than has been possible heretofore.",

    "abstract": "One potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. Between July 1, 1981, and March 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean, elective arterial reconstructive procedures. Control cultures were obtained from adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. Positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0 of 20) (p less than 0.001). The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). Our overall graft infection rate since January 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). All three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. Arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. Organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). These patients with culture-positive graft infections were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with negative arterial cultures. Positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). These data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of choice in acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis is still controversial. This prospective randomized study compares the results of conventional anticoagulation of 32 patients with the results obtained in 31 patients undergoing acute thrombectomy combined with a temporary arteriovenous fistula and anticoagulation. Early complications were few in both treatment groups, and significant pulmonary embolism developed in only one conservatively treated patient. At 6-month follow-up in all surviving patients, leg swelling, varicose veins, and venous claudication were more frequent after conservative treatment. Only 7% (2 of 27) of these patients were completely free from postthrombotic symptoms compared with 42% (10 of 24) of the operated patients (p less than 0.005). Contrast phlebography demonstrated an excellent venous outflow through the iliofemoral segment in 35% (9 of 26) of the conservatively treated and in 76% (16 of 21) of the operated patients (p less than 0.025). Open femoropopliteal veins with competent valves were recorded in 26% (7 of 27) in the conservative group and in 52% (12 of 23) in the thrombectomy group (p less than 0.05). Thus thrombectomy combined with arteriovenous fistula decreases early symptoms and preserves venous outflow and valvular function better than conservative treatment. This procedure is therefore recommended for young patients with acute iliofemoral thrombosis to avoid development of incapacitating postthrombotic sequelae.",

    "abstract": "To study the therapeutic effects of 3 mg/kg aspirin given at the time of surgery and postoperatively, Dacron carotid grafts with an internal diameter of 4 mm and a length of 6 cm were implanted bilaterally in mongrel dogs. Sixteen control grafts in eight subjects and 20 grafts in 10 subjects treated with aspirin were followed by serial angiograms until consecutive studies showed stable patency rates in both groups. Platelet aggregations, malondialdehyde production, serum salicylate levels, and thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin secretion (measured as thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) were monitored prior to and throughout the experiment. Surface mapping, indium-111 uptake, factor VIII-related antigen staining, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy were performed on the grafts at sacrifice. This study demonstrates a protective effect on the early patency of small-caliber prostheses in the canine model with daily oral aspirin administration. The degree and duration of this effect depends on the preoperative baseline ratio of thromboxane to prostacyclin in each subject.",

    "abstract": "Morphologic evaluation of synthetic grafts (both seeded and unseeded) harvested within 2 weeks of implantation has revealed heavy infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Since complement-activated PMNs are known to damage endothelial cells, we hypothesized that complement activation might prove a barrier to optimal endothelial cell seeding of prosthetic grafts. To determine whether synthetic vascular prostheses activate complement and whether the type of graft material influences the degree of activation, we assayed the plasma of 10 healthy donors for complement activity following incubation with short segments of knitted Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft material. C5a generation was measured by radioimmunoassay and granulocyte aggregometry. Standard hemolytic assays were used to determine depletion of functional classical pathway (CH50 and C4) alternative pathway (APH50) activity. Results indicated substantial complement activation by Dacron and virtually none by PTFE. Activation by Dacron appeared to occur via both complement pathways. Such complement \"reactivity\" may have important implications for the performance of prosthetic materials as small-caliber vascular grafts, whether seeded with endothelial cells or not.",

    "abstract": "Recently the noninvasive technique of videomicroscopy has demonstrated qualitative morphologic changes in the nutritional skin capillaries in atherosclerotic (ATS) patients. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively examine the ATS microcirculation and effects induced by reconstructive surgery. Capillary blood flow velocity (CBV) of single vessels within the nail fold of the large toe was measured by dual-sensor videodensitometry in 14 ATS patients (age 45 to 80 years) and 11 age-matched controls. In addition to CBV, capillary diameter (CD) and the number of flow-active capillaries (FC) were also measured at constant temperature. Of the 14 patients, eight had measurements repeated 1 week after reconstructive surgery. The measurements were obtained at rest and then periodically after a 45-second period of pedal inflow occlusion. Respective group averages at rest for CBV, CD, and FC for the 14 ATS patients were as follows: 0.16 mm/sec, 10.5 micron, and 6.8 capillaries per field. Corresponding values for the control subjects were 0.10 mm/sec, 8.7 micron, and 5.3 capillaries per field. Combining CBV, CD, and FC into a measurement of volume capillary flow yielded a value of 281 pl/sec/mm2 for the patients and only 85 pl/sec/mm2 for the controls (p less than 0.02). Peak postocclusion CBV significantly increased, whereas FC significantly decreased relative to rest in the control group; however, the only patient group that responded to occlusion-induced ischemia was the postoperative group. In these patients there was a decrease in CBV and an increase in FC relative to rest. These responses are exactly opposite to those in the age-matched controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Based on our previous study that the outcome of reconstructive surgery for lower limbs could well be predicted by flow waveforms and that this state was defined by variation of wall shear stress (tau) in a cardiac cycle, we set up a desktop computer that could calculate wall shear stress in a given patient. This work is based on a principle of a computational method for simulating pulsating blood flow. The flow data from the patient are sent to the waveform analyzer, where the intraluminal velocity profile as well as the shear stress variation is demonstrated. Our study revealed no late occlusion in patients with flow waveforms over 70 dynes/cm2 in tau-variation, early graft failure in those below 20 dynes/cm2, and late occlusion in considerable numbers of patients whose waveforms were between 70 and 20 dynes/cm2. Intraoperative use of the waveform analyzer disclosed the occult cause of obstruction, which would otherwise be overlooked, leading to a remarkable decrease in the rate of immediate graft failure. Follow-up of outpatients with this approach facilitated early detection of late failure, making it possible to repair the graft with minor surgery. Use of the waveform analyzer proved superior to ankle pressure index in predicting graft failure.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the relationship of platelet deposition to thromboxane and prostacyclin (PGI2) production in arterial autografts (n = 8), para-anastomotic native artery (n = 40), nonseeded control (n = 6), and endothelial cell-seeded (n = 17) small-diameter Dacron grafts implanted in the carotid and femoral arteries of dogs. Platelet deposition was measured by a dual-isotope subtraction platelet-imaging technique that expresses platelet deposition as percent indium excess (%IE). PGI2 and thromboxane assays were performed with the use of an immunoreactive assay. The %IE in the nonseeded grafts was significantly higher than in the seeded prostheses (p less than 0.001). Arterial autografts accumulated significantly less platelets than did seeded grafts (p less than 0.05) or nonseeded grafts (p less than 0.001). The thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production in nonseeded grafts was significantly higher than in seeded grafts (p less than 0.001), arterial autografts (p less than 0.001), or in para-anastomotic native artery (p less than 0.001). The PGI2 production by the arterial autografts was significantly higher than by the nonseeded grafts (p less than 0.005), seeded grafts (p less than 0.001), or para-anastomotic native artery (p less than 0.025). The PGF1 alpha/TXB2 ratio was significantly higher in the arterial autografts when compared with the nonseeded grafts (p less than 0.001), endothelial cell-seeded grafts (p less than 0.001), or para-anastomotic native artery (p less than 0.025). We conclude that platelet deposition can be significantly decreased by endothelial cell seeding of small-diameter grafts. The transmural production of TXA2 by native arteries and prosthetic grafts may have an important influence on platelet deposition and patency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "An inherited disorder of the fibrinolytic system has been discovered as a cause of unusual clotting. An abnormal immunoreactive plasminogen was identified in eight patients who presented with unexplained thrombosis. Six patients presented with spontaneous arterial or venous thrombosis, and two patients developed postoperative occlusion of an arterial reconstruction. Five of the six patients with spontaneous thrombosis had recurrent episodes involving both the arterial and venous system at time intervals between the thrombotic episodes varying from 1 month to several years. Detection of an abnormal plasminogen was made by immunoelectrophoresis of the patient's serum with an antiplasminogen sera. In normal patients, plasminogen migrates as a single band toward the anode. In these eight patients a separate immunoreactive band located nearer the anode and distinct from the normal band was detected. Examination of family members of two patients identified a similar abnormal plasminogen with an overall incidence suggestive of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This study suggests the presence of a genetically determined plasminogen variant resulting in a functional deficiency of the plasminogen system causing a reduction of fibrinolytic activity and a latent thrombotic tendency. Recommended treatment is long-term warfarin anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "We studied 117 inferior vena cava (IVC) replacements in dogs to determine the effects of graft material, graft size, endothelial seeding, and cultured endothelial linings on graft patency. As a control, the IVC was removed and reimplanted in 11 dogs. Dacron (n = 7) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) grafts (n = 12) were seeded immediately with the use of enzymatically derived autogenous jugular vein endothelium. Cultured linings were prepared for e-PTFE grafts (n = 9) by inoculating the graft with jugular endothelium and nurturing the lining in tissue culture for 14 to 30 days before implantation. Unseeded grafts (n = 27) were prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. These six methods of preparation were tested in grafts measuring 6 mm I.D. and 60 mm in length. Other sizes were tested with a Latin square study design. After 30 to 60 days the grafts were perfusion fixed and studied with light and transmission electron microscopy. Patency was determined by contrast cavography after 7 and 30 days. Patency in the IVC reimplantation was 100% compared with 28.0% of the e-PTFE (p = 0.001) and none of the Dacron grafts that measured 6 mm I.D. and 60 mm long. e-PTFE and Dacron graft patency also differed significantly (p = 0.035). Seeded and culture-lined e-PTFE grafts in that same size were patent in 31.6% compared with 16.7% of unseeded e-PTFE. With grafts measuring 80 mm long, three of the five e-PTFE grafts were patent between 3 and 7 days. All progressed to occlusion by 30 days and compared poorly with all other graft sizes tested (2.6% progression to occlusion [p = 3 X 10(-8)]). Recanalization was not seen in 10 occluded grafts that were followed for 60 days. The histologic features of seeded grafts differed remarkably from grafts previously studied in the arterial circulation and from culture-lined and unseeded venous prostheses in that 60% had prominent large, random, endothelium-lined channels within the inner capsule. Larger graft diameters (p = 0.009) and the omission of an endothelial surface treatment (p = 0.004) were associated with anastomotic subendothelial fibrous hyperplasia. We conclude that graft material is the major determinant of patency in IVC replacements, that an extensive endothelial surface promotes patency, but that simply seeding e-PTFE or Dacron grafts with 10(5) endothelial cells does not provide sufficient endothelium to alter early patency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In a randomized, multicenter trial the efficacy of intravenous dextran 40 (D-40; Rheomacrodex) in preventing early postoperative thrombosis was tested in the following difficult lower extremity bypasses: (1) femoropopliteal with poor runoff using autologous vein (AV), (2) femoropopliteal using grafts other than AV, (3) single or sequential bypasses to infrapopliteal arteries, and (4) the above-mentioned bypasses with adjunctive procedures that destroy adjacent endothelial surfaces (e.g., thrombectomy and endarterectomy). Five units of D-40 was administered to the experimental group at 75 to 100 ml/hr, two during and immediately after operation and one each 3 days postoperatively. Antiplatelet drugs were withheld until 1 week after surgery. The overall 1-week occlusion rate was 6.9% (5 of 73) with D-40 and 20.5% (17 of 83) for controls, which is statistically significant. Particularly significant was the difference in group 3: 0% (0 of 28) for D-40 and 27.8% (10 of 36) for controls. In the same time period there were no occlusions in group I and only one occlusion each with AV grafts in both D-40 and control groups, 2.6% (1 of 38). When grafts other than AV were used, the occlusion rate was significantly lower at 1 week for D-40, 11.4% (4 of 35), than controls, 35.6% (16 of 45). By 1 month the protective effect of D-40 was partially lost--15.3% (11 of 72) for D-40 and 20.7% (17 of 82) for controls (no statistical significance). Use of antiplatelet drugs during this period had no discernible effect.",
