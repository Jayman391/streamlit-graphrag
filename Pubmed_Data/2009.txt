    "abstract": "The diameter of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the single most important factor in deciding whether to repair an aneurysm or to monitor it conservatively. Open surgical repair does not appear to be beneficial until the diameter of the aneurysm is >5.5 cm. Prospective clinical trials, however, confirmed a lower risk of operative mortality after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) than after open surgical repair. Further, retrospective analyses of EVAR databases suggested that EVAR outcome is directly related to aneurysm size and is better for smaller aneurysms than for larger aneurysms. Noting similar results with open surgical management vs surveillance in patients with smaller AAA, lower morbidity rates with EVAR vs open repair, and the favorable results with EVAR in smaller aneurysms, a clinical trial testing the hypothesis that EVAR is beneficial in patients with small AAA appeared warranted. To answer this question, the 70-site Positive Impact of endoVascular Options for Treating Aneurysm earLy (PIVOTAL) was begun. PIVOTAL has an enrollment goal of up to 1025 patients with a 4- to 5-cm AAA, randomly assigning patients to EVAR or surveillance. The primary end points of PIVOTAL are aneurysm rupture and AAA-related death at up to 36 months after randomization. When complete, the results of PIVOTAL should provide objective evidence to guide the use of EVAR for small AAAs.",

    "abstract": "There is overwhelming evidence that statins reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary disease. Statins have also been shown to reduce the risk of (recurrent) stroke. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, which plays a causal role in the development of atherosclerotic disease, is the primary lipid target in prevention, and is effectively reduced by these agents. In this review, studies are summarized addressing the issues whether statins also directly influence the atherosclerotic process in peripheral arterial disease, carotid artery stenosis, and growth of abdominal aortic aneurysms, and whether statins have an effect on perioperative outcomes in vascular surgery patients. It appears that the evidence of statins on peripheral arterial disease is scarce and its effect on perioperative outcome inconclusive. Prospective randomized trials to answer these questions cannot be performed anymore, however, because all vascular patients should receive statin treatment as secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "With a shortage of active duty vascular surgeons in the military, Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) members have been called upon to perform short-term rotations at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), the US military's receiving facility for combat injuries sustained in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. From September 2007 to May 2008, 20 SVS vascular surgeons have performed 2-week rotations at LRMC through American Red Cross and US Army sponsorship. Volunteers were surveyed for previous military and/or trauma experience. In addition to reporting number and types of procedures performed, volunteers were queried on their experience and impression of the rotation. Several volunteers have had prior military experience and all have had vascular trauma experience through residency, fellowship, and current practices. With most definitive vascular repairs being done in theater, SVS members were most often called upon for clinical expertise in the care of combat casualties and evaluation of revascularization procedures. The volunteers contributed to daily rounds, patient care, and teaching conferences, as well as actively participated in surgical procedures with the most common being wound examinations under anesthesia for which intraoperative vascular consultation was occasionally requested (5-20 per volunteer). Additional procedures that volunteers performed included: inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, thrombectomy, revision of lower and upper extremity interposition vein grafts, retroperitoneal spine exposures, diagnostic and therapeutic angiograms, iliac stenting, and duplex ultrasound scan interrogation of vascular repairs, suspected arterial injuries, and deep vein thrombosis. All volunteers described the experience as valuable and will return if needed. With a limited number of military vascular surgeons and the unpredictable need for a vascular specialist at LRMC, civilian volunteers are playing an important role in providing high-quality vascular care for the nation's wounded soldiers by expanding vascular and endovascular capability at LRMC and contributing to general surgical critical care. As volunteers, SVS members are carrying on a tradition started by our surgical forefathers during previous US military conflicts.",

Ten years later, he was unable to ambulate due to increased bilateral lower leg volume, continuous pain, and recurrent episodes of cellulitis. He was treated at our tertiary-care center with compression therapy and circumferential liposuction of lower legs, ankles, and dorsum of feet in order to remove hypertrophic fat deposits, facilitate conservative therapy, and decrease further risk of cellulitis. No complications were seen and compression therapy was continued. Fourteen month follow-up reveals no increase in leg volume over time, absence of pain, and no further episodes of cellulitis with complete ability to ambulate and return to normal activities. Even when it does not eliminate the underlying cause of primary lymphedema, combined therapy consisting of compression and liposuction is safe and is able to achieve control, at least on a short term, of clinically disabling conditions associated with advanced stages.",

The pseudoaneurysm resulted from a complete fracture of a stent that had been placed at the origin of this vessel 10 months earlier. Because the left kidney had no residual function, the patient was treated by percutaneous occlusion of the left renal artery with a vascular plug. The symptoms rapidly subsided, and he remained symptom free at the 6-month follow-up. Stent fractures, their complications, and management are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular intervention is considered first-line therapy for most superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease. Duplex ultrasound (DU) criteria for SFA in-stent stenosis and correlation with angiographic data remain poorly defined. This study evaluated SFA-specific DU criteria for the assessment of SFA in-stent stenosis.\nFrom May 2003 to May 2008, 330 limbs underwent SFA angioplasty and stenting and were monitored by serial DU imaging. Suspected stenotic lesions underwent angiography and intervention when appropriate. Data pairs of DU and angiographically estimated stenosis <or=30 days of each other were analyzed. Seventy-eight limbs met these criteria, and 59 underwent reintervention. In-stent peak systolic velocity (PSV), the ratio of the stented SFA velocity/proximal SFA velocity, changes in ankle-brachial indices (ABIs), and the percentage of angiographic stenosis were examined. Linear regression and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to compare angiographic stenosis with PSV and velocity ratios (Vrs) to establish optimal criteria for determining significant in-stent stenosis.\nMean follow-up was 16.9 +/- 8.3 months. Of the 59 limbs that underwent reintervention, 37 (63%) were symptomatic, and 22 (37%) underwent reintervention based on DU findings alone. Linear regression models of PSV and Vr vs degree of angiographic stenosis showed strong adjusted correlation coefficients (R(2) = 0.60, P < .001 and R(2) = 0.55, P < 0.001, respectively). ROC curve analysis showed that to detect a >or=50% in-stent stenosis, a PSV >or=190 had 88% sensitivity, 95% specificity, a 98% positive predictive value (PPV), and a 72% negative predictive value (NPV); for Vr, a ratio of >1.50 had 93% sensitivity, 89% specificity, a 96% PPV, and a 81% NPV. To detect >or=80% in-stent stenosis, a PSV >or=275 had 97% sensitivity, 68% specificity, a 67% PPV, and a 97% NPV; a Vr ratio >or=3.50 had 74% sensitivity, 94% specificity, a 77% PPV, and a 88% NPV. Combining a PSV >or=275 and a Vr >or=3.50 to determine >or=80% in-stent stenosis had 74% sensitivity, 94% specificity, a 88% PPV, and a 85% NPV; odds ratio was 42.17 (95% confidence interval, 10.20-174.36, P < .001) to predict >or=80% in-stent stenosis. A significant drop in ABI (>0.15) correlated with a >62% in-stent stenosis, although the adjusted correlation coefficients was low (R(2) = 0.31, P = .02).\nPSV and Vr appear to have a significant role in predicting in-stent stenosis. To determine >or=80% stenosis, combining PSV >or=275 cm/s and Vr >or=3.50 is highly specific and predictive.",

    "abstract": "Data from multicenter studies support observation of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) over open repair (OR), but the role of endovascular repair (EVAR) is unclear pending outcome of the Positive Impact of EndoVascular Options for Treating Aneurysm earLy (PIVOTAL) trial. Our goal was to predict the outcome of the trial by comparing results of small AAA repair using EVAR vs OR at a tertiary institution.\nUsing selection criteria of PIVOTAL trial, we reviewed clinical data of 194 consecutive patients, who underwent EVAR or OR for 4.0-5.0 cm AAAs between 1997 and 2004. All-cause and aneurysm-related deaths, complications, reinterventions, ruptures, and conversions were documented; factors affecting outcome were analyzed using chi(2) tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, logistic regression Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Median follow-up was 3.9 years (range, 1 month to 9 years).\nA total of 194 patients, 162 males, 32 females (mean age: 71 years, range, 46-86) underwent 162 OR and 32 EVAR. EVAR patients were older (mean 74 +/- 6 vs 71 +/- 7, P = .002), had lower ejection fraction (mean 54 +/- 11 vs 61 +/- 13, P = .0002), and less likely to have ever smoked (69% vs 85%, P = .03) than OR patients. Thirty-day mortality was 1.3% (2/162) for OR and 0% for EVAR (0/33) (P = not significant [NS]). There were 49 systemic complications (7 EVAR, 42 OR, P = NS) and 10 local complications (3 EVAR, 7 OR, P = NS). During follow-up, there were no conversions and no ruptures. Freedom from reinterventions at 5 years was 83.1% +/- 6.9% for EVAR and 95.3% +/- 1.8% for OR (P = 0.02). There were 26 deaths (3 EVAR, 23 OR); but no procedure or aneurysm-related death was confirmed after 30 days (cause unknown in 16 deaths, 62%). Survival rates at 1-year were 96.6% +/- 3.4% for EVAR and 97.4% +/- 1.3% for OR; 5-year rates were 86.9% +/- 7.2% +/- EVAR and 86.9% +/- 3.3% for OR (P = 0.69). Multivariate analysis revealed age (hazard ratio = 1.1 per year, P = .0496) and AAA size (hazard ratio = 13.8 per 1 cm, P = .03) were associated with death but EVAR vs OR was not (P = .23).\nFor repair of small AAAs, results of EVAR vs OR are not different at 5 years at a tertiary institution. Multicenter studies confirmed OR were not superior to observation in these patients. We predict the PIVOTAL study will conclude EVAR is not superior to observation.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms involving the supra-aortic vessels are rare but carry serious risk of embolization, thrombosis, and rupture. We describe our experience with the diagnosis, treatment strategies, and outcomes in patients with extended follow-up.\nData during a 17-year period (January 1990 to December 2007) was analyzed. We assessed age, gender, presenting symptoms, localization, pathologic diagnosis, type of procedures, complications, and survival.\nA total of 74 patients were treated for supra-aortic aneurysms. Of all aneurysms treated, 63% were degenerative, 24% iatrogenic, 8% traumatic, 3% genetic, and 1% mycotic. The subclavian artery was most commonly affected (50%, 2/3 in the right side), followed by the common carotid (36%), internal carotid (10%), innominate (3%), and vertebral (1%). At the time of diagnosis, 52 patients (70%) were asymptomatic, but of those symptomatic 68% had an embolic event as a presenting symptom. Embolic episodes were more common in patients with smaller aneurysms (P < .006). Open surgery was performed in 77% of all cases, and the use of endovascular techniques became the predominant treatment modality over the last 4 years. Survival at 30 days was 100%. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 87% and 43%, respectively.\nMost cases of supra-aortic aneurysm are asymptomatic and embolization as opposed to rupture represents the greatest risk to the patient. Most cases can be detected prior to symptoms. Endovascular repair is an emerging alternative of treatment and, with the current development of appropriate devices, will likely form the mainstay of therapy in the near future.",

Most cases can be detected prior to symptoms. Endovascular repair is an emerging alternative of treatment and, with the current development of appropriate devices, will likely form the mainstay of therapy in the near future.",

The subclavian artery was most commonly affected (50%, 2/3 in the right side), followed by the common carotid (36%), internal carotid (10%), innominate (3%), and vertebral (1%). At the time of diagnosis, 52 patients (70%) were asymptomatic, but of those symptomatic 68% had an embolic event as a presenting symptom. Embolic episodes were more common in patients with smaller aneurysms (P < .006). Open surgery was performed in 77% of all cases, and the use of endovascular techniques became the predominant treatment modality over the last 4 years. Survival at 30 days was 100%. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 87% and 43%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinaemia is associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). There are inter-individual variations in the metabolism of homocysteine because of genetic polymorphisms. This study analyzed the role of one polymorphism that is associated with raised homocysteine, as a risk factor for PAD.\nThis study considered the association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphisms with the incidence of PAD by performing a case-control study and a cross sectional study of homocysteine levels. We recruited 133 patients with PAD in Norfolk and compared the MTHFR allele distribution with 457 healthy individuals. We also carried out a meta-analysis to place our data within the context of other published studies. We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to March 2008 for any studies on the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and PAD.\nThe MTHFR C677T allele frequencies in the cases and controls were 0.37 and 0.33, and the odds ratios for the association of the 677 T allele or TT genotype with PAD were 1.18 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.89, 1.58) and 1.99 (95% CI 1.09, 3.63). Homozygotes for the MTHFR C677T mutation had higher concentrations of plasma total homocysteine, odds ratio 2.82 (95% CI 1.03, 7.77) compared to homozygotes for the MTHFR 677 CC genotype. Twelve of 72 articles retrieved from the database search reported the prevalence of mutations in PAD patients. A meta-analysis of 9 appropriate studies, including our own, showed that being homozygous for the C677T allele was associated with an increased risk of PAD, pooled odds ratio 1.36 (95% CI 1.09, 1.68).\nWe have found a strong association between raised homocysteine, the TT genotype, and PAD.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has gained wide acceptance for the elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), leading to interest in similar treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate national outcomes after EVAR for RAAA and to assess the effect of institutional volume metrics.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients treated with open or EVAR for RAAA, 2001-2006. Procedure volume was determined for each institution categorizing hospitals as low-, medium-, and high-volume. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes related to resource utilization. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine independent predictors of EVAR usage and mortality.\nFrom 2001 to 2006, an estimated 27,750 hospital discharges for RAAA occurred; 11.5% were treated with EVAR. EVAR utilization increased over time (5.9% in 2001 to 18.9% in 2006, P < .0001) while overall RAAA rates remained constant. EVAR had a lower overall in-hospital mortality than open repair (31.7% vs 40.7%, P < .0001), an effect which amplified when stratified by institutional volume. On multivariable regression, open repair independently predicted mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.89). EVAR usage for RAAA increased with age (>80 years) (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.30-1.93), high elective EVAR volume (>40/y) vs medium (19-40/y) (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.86-3.78) and low (<19/y) (OR 5.37; 95% CI 3.60-8.0). EVAR had a shorter length of stay (11.1 vs 13.8 days, P < .0001), higher discharges to home (65.1% vs 53.9%, P < .0001), and lower charges ($108,672 vs $114,784, P < .0001).\nIn the United States, for RAAA, EVAR had a lower postoperative mortality than open repair. Higher elective open repair as well as RAAA volume increased this mortality advantage for EVAR. These results support regionalization of RAAA repair to high volume centers whenever possible and a wider adoption of endovascular repair of RAAA nationwide.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a hybrid repair for ruptured infected AFAPs consisted of percutaneous stent-graft deployment and second-stage surgical debridement.\nBetween October 2004 and January 2008, 6 patients (3 female, mean age 65.8 +/- 11.4 years) with ruptured infected AFAPs were treated with emergent percutaneous stent-graft implantation and secondary surgical debridement. Three patients had undergone a femoro-popliteal and 1 a femoro-tibial bypass for peripheral arterial disease, while 2 patients had a femoral arteriovenous graft (AVG) for hemodialysis access due to chronic renal failure. Four pseudoaneurysms were located at the common femoral artery (CFA) and 2 involved the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Mean pseudoaneurysm diameter was 6.8 +/- 0.9 mm (range, 5.4-7.8 mm). The mean interval between the initial operation and presentation to our department was 26.7 +/- 14.5 months (range, 7-50 months). All patients suffered from severe comorbidities and were judged unfit for major surgery under general anesthesia.\nAll patients were successfully managed by urgent percutaneous deployment of covered stents at the site of the arterial deficit. Extensive surgical debridement along with pseudoaneurysm excision was accomplished successfully in all 6 patients 1-3 days after stent-graft placement under local anesthesia, without the need for extended vessel exposure for proximal and distal control. No death occurred within 30 days after stent-graft implantation. During follow-up, (mean 14.1 +/- 8.2 months, range, 6 to 25 months) all stent-grafts remained patent without endoleak, while no signs of recurrent local or systemic infection were noticed. Two patients died at 8 and 10 months after the procedure due to heart failure complications and acute myocardial infarction, respectively.\nEmergency stent-graft deployment, followed by secondary surgical debridement and long-term antimicrobial therapy is a viable alternative for ruptured infected AFAPs. Especially for patients unfit for major surgery, it may be the most favorable treatment option.",

    "abstract": "To assess long-term quality of life outcomes in patients following transaxillary first-rib resection and scalenectomy for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).\nThis was a prospective observational study using the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) and Disability of Arm, Hand, and Shoulder (DASH) instruments between February 2005 and March 2008 in patients with TOS presenting to an academic medical center for preoperative surgical evaluation after failing physical therapy protocol. Surveys were conducted preoperatively and then again at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. Longitudinal data analysis was performed with population-averaged models using generalized estimating equations (GEE) method for average rate of recovery. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze time to return to work.\nA total of 70 out of 105 eligible patients (66.7%) completed the study protocol (44 neurogenic; 26 venous), returning 243 valid SF-12 surveys (162 neurogenic; 81 venous) and 188 valid DASH surveys (124 neurogenic; 64 venous). Half (50%) of the neurogenic patients and 77% of the venous patients returned to full-time work or activity within the study follow-up, with half of them doing so by 4 months and 75% of them by 5 months. There was no statistically significant difference in return to work between the neurogenic or venous patients. Neurogenic patients had baseline SF-12 Physical Component Scores (PCS) similar to chronic heart failure patients and were significantly worse than venous patients (33.8 vs 43.6, P < .001). In contrast, no difference existed in Mental Component Scores (MCS) (44.5 vs 43.5, P = .78). In follow-up, on average, PCS scores for neurogenic patients improved 0.24 points (P < .001) and MCS scores improved 0.15 points per month (P = .01); while PCS scores for venous patients improved 0.40 points (P = .004) and MCS scores improved 0.55 points per month (P < .001). Additionally, neurogenic patients had baseline DASH scores that were similar to patients with rotator cuff tears, and they were also significantly worse than venous patients (50.2 vs 25.0, P < .001).

Half (50%) of the neurogenic patients and 77% of the venous patients returned to full-time work or activity within the study follow-up, with half of them doing so by 4 months and 75% of them by 5 months. There was no statistically significant difference in return to work between the neurogenic or venous patients. Neurogenic patients had baseline SF-12 Physical Component Scores (PCS) similar to chronic heart failure patients and were significantly worse than venous patients (33.8 vs 43.6, P < .001). In contrast, no difference existed in Mental Component Scores (MCS) (44.5 vs 43.5, P = .78). In follow-up, on average, PCS scores for neurogenic patients improved 0.24 points (P < .001) and MCS scores improved 0.15 points per month (P = .01); while PCS scores for venous patients improved 0.40 points (P = .004) and MCS scores improved 0.55 points per month (P < .001). Additionally, neurogenic patients had baseline DASH scores that were similar to patients with rotator cuff tears, and they were also significantly worse than venous patients (50.2 vs 25.0, P < .001).

    "abstract": "Penetrating common femoral artery injuries are life-threatening, especially when the femoral bifurcation has been destroyed. In the presence of other associated injuries which preclude immediate definitive vascular reconstruction, temporary arterial shunting may be useful. Presently available shunts, however, are tubular and allow for distal perfusion to only one vessel. We have utilized a modified bifurcated hemodialysis catheter (Mahurkar MAXID; Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, Mass) to successfully provide simultaneous perfusion from the proximal common femoral artery to both the superficial and deep femoral vessels. Such catheters are readily available in most institutions, can be quickly modified, and are easy use in urgent trauma situations.",

    "abstract": "With the expansion of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair after the introduction of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), there is a concern that even with a lower operative mortality there could be an increasing number of aneurysm-related deaths. To evaluate this, we looked at national trends in AAA repair volume as well as mortality rates after intact and ruptured AAA repair encompassing the introduction of EVAR.\nPatients with intact or ruptured AAA undergoing open repair or EVAR and all those with a diagnosis of ruptured AAA were identified within the 1993 to 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnosis and procedure codes. The number of repairs, number of rupture diagnoses without repair, number of deaths, and associated mortality rates were measured for each year of the database. Outcomes (mean annual volumes) were compared from the pre-EVAR era (1993 to 1998) with the post-EVAR era (2001 to 2005).\nSince its introduction, EVAR increased steadily and accounted for 56% of repairs yet only 27% of the deaths for intact repairs in 2005. The mean annual number of intact repairs increased from 36,122 in the pre-EVAR era to 38,901 in the post-EVAR era, whereas the mean annual number of deaths related to intact AAA repair decreased from 1693 pre-EVAR to 1207 post-EVAR (P < .0001). Mortality for all intact AAA repair decreased from 4.0% to 3.1% (P < .0001) pre-EVAR and post-EVAR, but open repair mortality was unchanged (open repair, 4.7% to 4.5%, P = .31; EVAR, 1.3%). During the same time, the mean annual number of ruptured repairs decreased from 2804 to 1846, and deaths from ruptured AAA repairs decreased from 2804 to 1846 (P < .0001). Mortality for ruptured AAA repair decreased from 44.3% to 39.9% (P < .0001) pre-EVAR and post-EVAR (open repair, 44.3% to 39.9%, P < .001; EVAR, 32.4%). The overall mean annual number of ruptured AAA diagnoses (9979 to 7773, P < .0001) and overall mean annual deaths from a ruptured AAA decreased post-EVAR (5338 to 3901, P < .0001).\nSince the introduction of EVAR, the annual number of deaths from intact and ruptured AAA has significantly decreased. This coincided with an increase in intact AAA repair after the introduction of EVAR and a decrease in ruptured AAA diagnosis and repair volume.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective analysis of immediate outcomes following aneurysm rupture (rAAA) in two groups: patients previously treated at our center with primary endovascular repair (EVAR) and patients without previous EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in an 8-year period.\nFourteen patients with a confirmed rAAA identified throughout the follow-up period following primary EVAR repair at our center (from a population of 820 AAA treated at our center in election) were retrospectively compared with 155 patients without previous EVAR in the same time period, from the introduction of an intention-to-treat protocol with EVAR for rAAA in January 1999. Primary study outcomes included 30-day mortality and severe systemic complications following rAAA correction with both open and EVAR treatments.\nIn the 14 patients secondary interventions were necessary throughout follow-up prior to rupture in 43% (6/14). The mean time to rupture was 50.23 months (9-113). The mean increase in maximum aneurysmal diameter at rupture was 18.39 mm. Type of endoleaks observed at rupture: 35.7% I proximal, 35.7% III contralateral stump disconnection, 14.3% I distal, 14.3% III midgraft tear: treatment at rupture included five EVAR corrections with aortouniiliac endografts, four EVAR corrections with extensions, and five surgical conversions. Thirty-day mortality between the two groups, 28.5% (patients with prior EVAR) 38.7% (patients without prior EVAR), and severe systemic complications, 50% vs 37.6%, were not found to be statistically significant. Hemodynamic instability, 36% (patients with prior EVAR) 63% (patients without prior EVAR), was found to be an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (P < .0001), whereas severe systemic complications, 50% vs 33.5%, did not influence the same outcome (P = .852).\nIn terms of mortality, it would be logical to expect a protection from the endograft in patients with previous EVAR. A trend seems to confirm this assumption, but no statistical significance was found, which may be due to the small population size.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUS) in the detection of endoleaks in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who underwent endovascular repair (EVAR) compared with unenhanced ultrasound imaging. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was the gold standard. The secondary objective was to define the optimal dose of the second-generation contrast agent to routinely use in the CEUS examinations for endoleak detection.\nThe study enrolled 84 patients with unruptured AAA who were treated with EVAR and underwent CTA follow-up. In the same day, CTA (4- x 1-mm collimation, 1.25-mm slice width), unenhanced US imaging and CEUS imaging was performed in all patients. The CEUS studies were performed after an intravenous bolus injection of 1.2 mL and 2.4 mL of a second-generation contrast agent with continuous low-mechanical index (range, 0.01-0.04) real-time tissue harmonic imaging. The unenhanced US and CEUS studies were interpreted separately by two independent experienced readers to detect the presence of endoleaks by viewing recorded videotapes according to a five-point confidence scale. The standard of reference was represented by the consensus reading of CTA performed by two experienced radiologists not involved in the image analysis. Qualitative analysis as well as sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy in detecting endoleaks of each reading session were compared.\nCEUS imaging significantly improved the diagnostic performance of unenhanced US studies in the detection of endoleaks in terms of sensitivity (97.5% vs 62.5%), negative predictive value (97.3% vs 65.1%), accuracy (89.3% vs 63.1%), and specificity (81.8% vs 63.6%). The optimal dose of contrast agent to detect and characterize endoleaks was 2.4 mL. No adverse events were recorded during the study.\nThe results showed CEUS imaging is a fast, noninvasive, reliable, and valid alternative to multislice CTA for endoleak detection in endovascular aortic stent graft patients, and is superior to unenhanced US imaging. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging should be performed using a recommended contrast medium dose of 2.4 mL.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the optimization of indications to external valve support using the Vedensky Spiral for primary deep venous reflux based on the femoral vein proximal (ostial) valve anatomy type.\nThe external Vedensky Spiral was used for correction of valvular insufficiency in 28 extremities of 24 patients (18 women, 6 men) during 1998 to 2002. Patients were a mean age of 54.6 years (range, 32-76 years). The clinical manifestation was C(4) in 10 limbs and C(5) in 18 limbs. Primary axial deep reflux was present in all 28 extremities, and axial superficial reflux was also present in 26. Duplex scanning and descending phlebography were used to estimate the functional condition of the deep vein valves. Fibrophleboscopy intraoperatively to study the anatomic status of the femoral vein valves and for checking the repaired valve function was used.\nPhleboscopy showed the following anatomy of ostial valves of the femoral vein: 16 valves had wide separation of cusps, 11 had elongation of cusps, and one had a monocusp. The competence of femoral vein ostial valves was completely restituted in all cases with wide separation of cusps. Multiple corrections were performed in cases with incomplete competence of the ostial valve (valve with elongation of cusps or monocusp).\nExternal valve support by the Vedensky Spiral is an effective and simple method of correction of incompetent femoral vein valves in limbs with primary deep venous reflux. The technical success of the intervention depends on the type of valve insufficiency and the correct choice of spiral diameter.",

    "abstract": "Patients with either renovascular hypertension (RVH) and/or renal insufficiency (RI) due to renal artery ostial occlusive disease (RAOOD) can successfully undergo an open surgical reconstruction procedure (OSRP), but since the publication of Blum et al(1) percutaneous balloon stent angioplasty (PTRA + stent) leaving a small part of the stent within the aorta has become very popular. However, balloon dilatation and stenting does not remove the atherosclerotic plaque, which is often heavily calcified but leads to disruption of the plaque causing myointimal hyperplasia and recurrent stenosis. Therefore, a comparison of the two treatment modalities concerning complications and durability in a prospective randomized design was felt to bring more insight to the discussion.\nFrom 1998 to 2004, we performed OSRP in 330 patients with RVH and/or RI for various locations of RAOOD. During this time period, 50 patients (female 18, male 32, mean age 64.4 years) with RAOOD of at least 70% stenosis (DSA and duplex criteria) in one or both renal arteries, who did not require other aorto/mesenteric/iliac reconstructive procedures agreed and were randomized to either OSRP (n = 25 patients, 49 arteries) or PTRA + stent (n = 25 patients, 28 arteries). Two patients crossed over to surgical treatment. Patients were followed on a regular basis for 4 years and longer. Endpoints were re-occurrence of RAOOD and impairment of either kidney function or RVH.\nWe approached 77 arteries. There was no early mortality in either group, but directly procedure-related morbidity was 13% in the interventional group and 4% in the surgical group. Four-year follow-up mortality was 18% in the interventional group and 25% in the surgical group. Both groups showed significant improvement of RVH (P < .001 in each group) as well as improvement or stabilization in patients with insufficient renal function. Freedom from recurrent RAOOD (>70%) was achieved in 90.1% of the surgical group and 79.9% of the interventional group.\nBoth treatment modalities showed good early results concerning RVH, kidney function, and renal perfusion. Despite a higher number of bilateral renal artery reconstructions in patients undergoing OSRP, which was probably due to the preferred technique of transaortic endarterectomy eliminating the plaque originating in the aorta and usually extending into both renal arteries, mortality was not higher and procedure-related morbidity was even lower compared to PTRA + stent. These findings and also longer durability of OSRP imply that surgical reconstruction remains the gold standard for patients with RAOOD before PTRA + stent may be considered.",

Patients were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up consisted of clinical examinations and computed tomography (CT) scanning.\nA total of 54 patients were included in this study. Median age was 72 (interquartile range [IQR] 68-76) years and 85% were men. Median preoperative aneurysm diameter was 60 (53-66) mm. One hundred thirty-four vessels were targeted (43 scallops, 91 fenestrations) and 96 stents were placed (69 bare, 27 covered). Target vessel catheterization was achieved in 98% of cases. Two patients (3.7%) died within 30 days, 1 from trash embolization and multiorgan failure and 1 from retroperitoneal bleeding caused by a renal artery perforation. Three type I endoleaks occurred intraoperatively, two sealed pre-discharge and one was treated with a Palmaz stent (Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla) on postoperative day 4. Thirteen patients had type II endoleaks, and 2 required treatment. The median clinical follow-up was 25 (12-32) months with median CT follow-up of 22 (4-26) months. Aneurysm diameter decreased >or=5 mm in 47%, was unchanged in 50%, and increased >or=5 mm in 3% of patients at 1 year. There were three type II endoleaks at 1-year follow-up, one of which was successfully treated after 19 months due to aneurysm growth. Ninety-six percent of target vessels remained patent during the study period and all occlusions occurred within the first year of follow-up. Five target vessels occluded (2 renal arteries [RAs] and 3 superior mesenteric arteries [SMAs]) without symptoms during follow-up and successful reinterventions were done on 2 stenosed RAs. Three patients suffered creatinine increase but none needed dialysis. One late aneurysm-related death occurred due to massive bleeding during redo surgery for infection.\nDespite complex anatomy or severe comorbidities in these patients f-EVAR has acceptable short- and midterm results in this series which includes a learning curve and offers a valid treatment alternative to patients unsuitable for standard EVAR or open repair.",

    "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated a 70% incidence of microemboli on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) following carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of microemboli in two distinct time periods when procedural modifications were implemented into a CAS program.\nFollowing a retrospective quality review of our CAS cohort (n = 27) from November 2004 through April 2006 (period 1), we enrolled patients (n = 20) from May 2006 through February 2008 (period 2) undergoing CAS into a prospective cohort that included obtaining pre- and postprocedure DW-MRI exams. Procedural modifications during period 2 included the preferential use of closed-cell systems (60% vs 0% in period 1), early heparinization at the initiation of arterial access, and elimination of an arch angiogram. The hospital records of these 47 patients were reviewed; symptoms, comorbidities, lesion characteristics, periprocedural information, and postoperative outcomes were collected. The incidence and location of acute, postprocedural microemboli were determined using DW-MRIs.\nTwenty (74%) CAS patients from period 1 and seven (35%) patients from period 2 demonstrated acute microemboli on postprocedural DW-MRI (P = .02). The mean number of microemboli in period 1 was 4.1 +/- 5.3 vs 1.5 +/- 2.7 during period 2 (P = .04). Two of the 27 patients (7.4%) during period 1 experienced temporary neurologic changes that resolved within 36 hours. None of the patients during period 2 exhibited any neurologic changes. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms were similar between the two groups except for smoking prevalence, female presence, and obesity (BMI > 30). Period 2 patients when compared with period 1 had more technically challenging anatomy with more calcified lesions (68% vs 27%), longer lesions (15.9 mm vs 8.2 mm), and higher incidence of ulceration (55% vs 27%) (all P < .04).\nDespite successful performance of 47 consecutive CAS procedures without permanent neurologic sequelae, significant reductions in periprocedural embolic events as identified via DW-MRI lesions may be achieved through implementation of quality improvement measures identified through continuous outcome analysis. The long-term neurologic benefits associated with reduced subclinical neurologic events remains to be determined.",

Two of the 27 patients (7.4%) during period 1 experienced temporary neurologic changes that resolved within 36 hours. None of the patients during period 2 exhibited any neurologic changes. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms were similar between the two groups except for smoking prevalence, female presence, and obesity (BMI > 30). Period 2 patients when compared with period 1 had more technically challenging anatomy with more calcified lesions (68% vs 27%), longer lesions (15.9 mm vs 8.2 mm), and higher incidence of ulceration (55% vs 27%) (all P < .04).",

    "abstract": "To describe the anatomic variations, symptomatology, and pathophysiology associated with the sciatic nerve (SN), and report the results after treatment of the incompetent veins.\nRetrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients with signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease that had superficial varicosities associated with incompetent veins along the SN. Patients were evaluated with duplex ultrasound scans. In patients with enlarged veins along the SN, the anatomy of the incompetent veins, their size and association with superficial varicosities, and the severity of insufficiency were analyzed. The symptoms associated with their presence and the treatment results were also noted. Patients were re-evaluated following treatment for recurrence of varicosities and symptoms.\nWe identified 24 limbs in 21 patients with varicosities along the SN and its branches. The duration of signs and symptoms was 4.5 years ranging from 1 to 14. Reflux was detected in 18 veins of the SN, in three persistent sciatic veins and in three veins of the tibial nerve. All limbs with sciatic and tibial nerve veins had varicosities in the lateral and posterior aspect of thigh and calf and were symptomatic. Ten limbs presented with CEAP class 2, 5 with class 3, 2 with class 4, and 1 with class 1. Pain or tingling was reported in 15 limbs, itching in 8, and heaviness in 7. The distribution of pain and tingling was present along the nerves in 19 limbs. One patient had acute thrombosis in a persistent sciatic vein and died from pulmonary embolism. Of the 21 limbs with SN veins, 16 were treated with subfascial vein ligation and phlebectomies. Three patients had sclerotherapy, 1 refused treatment, and 1 had mild symptoms not requiring treatment. Of the 19 treated limbs, in 11 there was relief of their symptoms, 6 had significant improvement, and 2 had no change. Within a year, 4 patients required additional treatment for veins along the same area. Eleven limbs had a follow-up duplex scan 3 to 19 months after their treatment. All limbs showed significant diameter reduction in the nerve veins while mild reflux was present in 3 (4.1 mm vs 2.1 mm, P < .001).\nReflux is the most common pathology of the sciatic and tibial nerve veins which produces significant symptoms along the distribution of the nerves. Treatment of the varicosities offers significant relief while recurrence or residual varicosities are easily managed.",

    "abstract": "May-Thurner syndrome is characterized by left common iliac obstruction secondary to compression of the left iliac vein by the right common iliac artery against the fifth-lumbar vertebra. This anatomic variant results in an increased incidence of left-sided deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Furthermore, while a preponderance of left-sided DVT has been demonstrated in women during pregnancy and oral contraceptive use, patients are not typically screened for this condition after developing a left-sided DVT. As anticoagulation alone is ineffective for DVT treatment in the setting of May-Thurner anatomy, more aggressive treatment is warranted. Failure to diagnosis this condition predisposes these women to the unnecessary risks of recurrent DVT and post-thrombotic syndrome.\nWe present the occurrence of 7 adolescent patients with previously undiagnosed May-Thurner syndrome who presented with DVT after the initiation of oral contraceptive steroids (OCP) use. All 7 patients elected to proceed with mechanical thrombolysis/catheter based thrombolysis followed by endovascular stenting and were postoperatively treated with 6 months of warfarin.\nMean patient age was 18.3 +/- 3.3 years (range, 16-24 years). Mean time to presentation after initiation of OCP was 5 weeks (range, 2-10 weeks). Mean time to intervention was 16.8 days (range, 10-24 days). All patients were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Our rate of intraoperative clot resolution was 100%. All 7 patients were treated with self expanding nitinol stents after angioplasty of the iliac vein stenosis with resolution of the stenotic segment. Primary stent patency is 100% (7/7). Mean follow-up time is 13 +/- 13.84 months (range, 6-42 months). There have been no long-term complications related to surgical treatment or anticoagulation. All 7 patients have experienced resolution of left leg swelling and pain and have no evidence of post-thrombotic syndrome or DVT recurrence to date.\nWomen on OCPs presenting with left-sided iliofemoral DVT should be screened for hypercoagulable disorders and underlying May-Thurner anatomy. Treatment of May-Thurner syndrome should include thrombolysis/thrombectomy and anticoagulation for current DVT in addition to angioplasty and stenting of the underlying obstruction.",

Evaluation of outcomes for EVAR explants may identify risks for complications and alter clinical management.\nA patient database was used to identify EVAR patients requiring explant >1 month after implant. A retrospective analysis was conducted of the type of graft, duration of implant, reason for removal, operative technique, death, and length of stay.\nDuring 1999 through 2007, 1606 EVARs were performed, and 25 patients required explantation, with an additional 16 referred from other institutions (N = 41). The average age was 73 years (range, 50-87 years); 90% were men. Grafts were excised after a median of 33.3 months (range, 3-93 months). Explanted grafts included 16 AneuRx (40%), 7 Ancure (17%), 6 Excluder (15%), 4 Zenith (10%), 4 Talent (10%), 1 Cook Aortomonoiliac rupture graft, 1 Endologix, 1 Quantum LP, and 1 homemade tube graft. Overall hospital mortality was 19% and occurred after conversion for rupture in 4, and in infected graft, aortoenteric fistula, repair of new aneurysm of the visceral segment, and claudication due to graft stenosis in one patient each. Elective EVAR-related mortality was 3.3%. Mortality was higher in patients with rupture compared with nonrupture (4 of 6 vs 3 of 35, P <or= .01). Thirty patients (73%) had one or more endoleaks (type I, 16; II, 9; III, 9; endotension, 5). Migration (n = 10), rupture (n = 6), aortoenteric fistula (n = 3), infection (n = 1), limb thrombosis (n = 3), and claudication (n =1) were also factors. Proximal aortic control was above the endograft (supravisceral, 23; suprarenal, 12; infrarenal, 6). Reconstruction was an aortoiliac repair in 63% and tube graft in 25%. Grafts with suprarenal fixation required longer proximal aortic clamp time of 43 minutes vs 28 minutes for infrarenal fixation. Complete graft removal was achieved in 85%. Proximal or distal portions of the endograft were incorporated into the repair in the remaining six.\nElective EVAR conversion, although technically challenging may be done with mortality similar to primary open repair. Mortality for conversion for infected grafts and ruptured aneurysms remains high. EVAR is associated with continued risk of conversion, and surveillance may identify late complications that require removal, justifying lifelong monitoring. Aggressive management of late complications and elective conversion may minimize the mortality associated with this procedure.",

Demographics, comorbidities, procedural data, and follow-up information were recorded. PTA failure was defined as first significant event including restenosis by duplex scan (>3.5 x velocity ratio), occlusion, redo-PTA, surgical revision, or amputation. Descriptive, logistic regression and life-table analyses were performed.\nEighty-seven grafts in 79 patients underwent PTA. Mean age was 70 years (median 70; range, 39-89 years), 71% were male and 52% were symptomatic (40% with limb-threat). Mean follow-up was 17 months (median 17.4; range, 0.03-39.8 months).

    "abstract": "Claudication is the most common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) producing significant ambulatory compromise. The purpose of this study was to use advanced biomechanical analysis to characterize the kinematic ambulatory pattern of claudicating patients. We hypothesized that compared with control subjects, claudicating patients have altered kinematic gait patterns that can be fully characterized utilizing advanced biomechanical analysis.\nThe study examined fourteen PAD patients (age: 58 +/- 3.4 years; weight: 80.99 +/- 15.64 kg) with clinically diagnosed femoro-popliteal occlusive disease (Ankle Brachial Index (ABI): 0.56 +/- 0.03, range 0.45 to 0.65) and five healthy controls (age: 53 +/- 3.4 years; weight: 87.38 +/- 12.75 kg; ABI >or= 1). Kinematic parameters (hip, knee, and ankle joint angles in the sagittal plane) were evaluated during gait in patients before and after the onset of claudication pain and compared with healthy controls. Joint angles were calculated during stance time. Dependent variables were assessed (maximum and minimum flexion and extension angles and ranges of motion) and mean ensemble curves were generated. Time to occurrence of the discrete variables was also identified.\nSignificantly greater ankle plantar flexion in early stance and ankle range of motion during stance was observed in PAD patients (P < .05). Time to maximum ankle plantar flexion was shorter and time to maximum ankle dorsiflexion was longer in PAD patients (P < .05). These differences were noted when comparing PAD patients prior to and after the onset of claudication with healthy controls. The analysis of the kinematic parameters of the knee and the hip joints revealed no significant differences between PAD patients and controls.\nPAD patients with claudication demonstrate significant gait alterations in the ankle joint that are present prior to the onset of claudication pain. In contrast, the joint motion of the hip and knee did not differ in PAD patients when compared with controls. Further research is needed to verify our findings and assess the impact of more proximal disease in PAD patients as well as the effect of revascularization on joint kinematics.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported a familial clustering of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) supporting that AAA is an inheritable disease, but few population-based studies can be found. Possible gender differences regarding hereditary patterns have been reported.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the risk of developing an AAA for first-degree relatives of patients with AAA in Sweden and compare them with matched controls and their relatives.\nAll persons (3183) born after 1932, diagnosed with AAA between 2001 and 2005, and a random selection of 15,943 age-, gender-, and region-matched controls were included. First-degree relatives of cases and controls were identified via the Multigeneration Register. Family history of AAA for cases and controls was assessed by linking the relatives to the Hospital Discharge Register and Cause of Death Register. The data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression.\nThe overall relative risk of AAA associated with family history compared to no family history was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-2.2). Comorbidities were more common among the cases than the controls (P < .0001) but the relative risks remained unchanged after adjustment for comorbidities. Stratification for absence or presence of comorbidities showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = .29). The relative risk of AAA for first-degree relatives was similar for women and men (P = .22 for gender differences), ie, the relative risk of AAA was not dependent on the gender of the index person.\nIn this nationwide survey, the relative risk of developing AAA for first-degree relatives to persons diagnosed with AAA was approximately doubled compared to persons with no family history. Neither the gender of the index person nor the first-degree relative influenced the risk of AAA.",

Patient symptoms included both claudication and limb threatening ischemia with or without tissue loss. The TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) II A (N = 18), B (N = 56), C (N = 11), and D (N = 15) lesions were included. Patients were randomized prospectively into one of two treatment groups; a percutaneous treatment group (group A; N = 50) with angioplasty and placement of one or more stent-grafts or a surgical treatment group (group B; N = 50) with a femoral to above knee popliteal artery bypass using synthetic conduit (Dacron graft or ePTFE). Patients were followed for a total of 24 months. Follow-up evaluation included clinical assessment and physical examination, ankle-brachial indices (ABI), and color flow duplex sonography at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.\nThe mean total lesion length of the treated arterial segment in the stent-graft group was 25.6 cm (SD +/- 15 cm). The stent-graft group demonstrated a primary patency of 81%, 72%, and 63% with a secondary patency of 86%, 83%, and 74% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The surgical femoral-popliteal group demonstrated a primary patency of 84%, 77%, and 64% with a secondary patency of 89%, 86%, and 76% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. No statistical difference was found between the two groups with respect to primary (P = .716) or secondary patency (P = .695). Grouping of less severe (TASC II A/B) vs more severe (TASC II C/D) lesions demonstrated patency at 24 months for the femoral-popliteal arm of 63% and 67%, respectively while that of the stent-graft arm was 64% and 47%, respectively. Secondary patency was 76% in both TASC classifications for the femoral-popliteal arm with 78% and 47% patency found respectively in the stent-graft group. These resulted in no significant difference for primary (P = .978) or secondary (P = .653) patency overall, although there is a trend for decreased patency with higher TASC II lesions.\nManagement of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with percutaneous stent-grafts exhibits similar primary patency at 24-month follow-up when compared with conventional femoral-popliteal artery bypass grafting with synthetic conduit. This treatment method may offer an alternative to treatment of the superficial femoral artery segment for revascularization when prosthetic bypass is being considered or when autologous conduit is unavailable.",

The purpose of this randomized trial was to determine whether renal perfusion with cold blood provides better protection against renal ischemia than perfusion with cold crystalloid in patients undergoing TAAA repair with left heart bypass.\nOne hundred seventy-two patients were enrolled. Strict inclusion criteria were used, including planned Crawford extent II or III TAAA repair with left heart bypass. The patients were randomly assigned to receive intermittent renal perfusion with either 4 degrees C lactated Ringer's solution (n = 86) or 4 degrees C blood (n = 86). Renal complications within 10 days of operation were stratified by renal dysfunction score (RDS). Postoperative changes in the levels of five urinary biomarkers-retinol binding protein, alpha-1 microglobulin, microalbumin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase-were compared to assess potential differences in subclinical renal injury.\nAlthough total ischemic times were longer in the cold blood group, unprotected ischemic times were similar between the two groups. Twenty-seven patients in the cold blood group (31%) and 21 patients in the cold crystalloid group (24%) had peak RDS >or=2 (serum creatinine >50% above baseline; P = .4). There were no differences between the cold blood and cold crystalloid groups in the incidence of early death (7/86 [8%] vs 5/86 [6%], respectively; P = .8) or renal failure requiring hemodialysis (3/86 [3%] in both groups). Changes in renal biomarker levels were also similar in the two groups. Spinal cord deficits developed in 5 patients in the cold blood group (6%); there were no such deficits in the cold crystalloid group (P = .06).\nCold renal perfusion during TAAA repair provides effective protection against renal injury. Using cold blood instead of cold crystalloid does not enhance renal protection.",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin, a novel growth hormone-releasing peptide, is implicated to play a protective role in cardiovascular tissues. However, it is not clear whether ghrelin protects vascular tissues from injury secondary to risk factors such as homocysteine (Hcy). This study investigated the effect and potential mechanisms of ghrelin on Hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction.\nPorcine coronary artery rings were incubated for 24 hours with ghrelin (100 ng/mL), Hcy (50 microM), or ghrelin plus Hcy. Endothelial vasomotor function was evaluated using the myograph tension model. The response to the thromboxane A(2)analog U46619, bradykinin, and sodium nitroprusside was analyzed. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry staining, and superoxide anion production was documented lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence analysis. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were treated with different concentrations of Hcy, ghrelin, or antighrelin receptor antibody for 24 hours, and eNOS protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis.\nMaximal contraction with U46619 and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation with sodium nitroprusside were not different among the four groups. However, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation with bradykinin (10(-6) M) was significantly reduced by 34% with Hcy compared with controls (P < .05). The addition of ghrelin to Hcy had a protective effect, with 61.6% relaxation, which was similar to controls (64.7%). Homocysteine significantly reduced eNOS expression, whereas ghrelin cotreatment effectively restored eNOS expression to the control levels. Superoxide anion levels, which were increased by 100% with Hcy, returned to control levels with ghrelin cotreatment. Ghrelin also effectively blocked the Hcy-induced decrease of eNOS protein levels in HCAECs in a concentration-dependent manner. Antighrelin receptor antibody effectively inhibited the effect of ghrelin.\nGhrelin has a protective effect in the porcine coronary artery by blocking Hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction, improving eNOS expression, and reducing oxidative stress. Ghrelin also shows a protective effect on HCACEs from the Hcy-induced decrease in eNOS protein levels. The effect of ghrelin is receptor-dependent. Thus, ghrelin administration may have beneficial effects in the treatment of vascular disease in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.",

Patients were subdivided into groups by creatinine level (mg/dL): group 1 (1.5-2.0), group 2 (2.0-3.0), group 3 (>3.0), and group 4 (preoperative dialysis-dependent). Demographics, aneurysm/aortic lesion characteristics, perioperative morbidity, mortality, and follow-up data were compared with 246 control patients (<1.5 mg/dL).\nComorbidities were similar between the renal insufficiency and control groups, except for age (74 +/- 8 vs 69 +/- 6 years, P < .0002), male gender (73% vs 58%, P < .02), and presence of peripheral vascular disease (56% vs 38%, P < .005). Mean follow-up was 9 months. The renal insufficiency and control groups had similar aortic pathologies, including fusiform (51% vs 57%) and saccular aneurysms (27% vs 37%).

At each medical center, patients from the operative schedule were prospectively and systematically enrolled according to NSQIP protocols. Outcomes and risk variables were compared across NIH-defined obesity classes (underweight [BMI<or=18.5], normal [18.5<BMI<25], overweight [25<BMI<or=30], obese I [30<BMI<or=35], obese II [35<BMI<or=40], and obese III [BMI>40]) using analysis of variance and means comparisons. Logistic regression was used to control for other risk factors.\nVascular procedures in 7,543 patients included lower extremity revascularization (24.6%), aneurysm repair (17.4%), cerebrovascular procedures (17.3%), amputations (9.4%), and \"other\" procedures (31.3%). In the entire cohort, there were 1,659 (22.0%) patients with complications and 295 (3.9%) deaths. Risk factors of hypertension and diabetes increased with BMI (analysis of variance [ANOVA] P < .05) as expected; smoking, disseminated cancer, and stroke decreased (ANOVA P < .01). Twenty other risk factors, as well as mortality and morbidity, had \"U\" or \"J\"-shaped distributions with the highest incidence in underweight and/or obese class III extremes but reduced minimums in overweight or obese I classes (ANOVA P < .05). After controlling for age, gender, and operation type, mortality risk remained lowest in obese class I patients (Odds ratio [OR] 0.63, P = .023) while morbidity risk was highest in obese class III patients (OR 1.70, P = .0003), due to wound infection, thromboembolism, and renal complications.\nUnderweight patients have poorer outcomes and class III obesity is associated with increased morbidity. Mildly obese patients have reduced co-morbid illness, surprisingly even less than normal-class patients, with correspondingly reduced mortality. Mild obesity is not a risk factor for 30-day outcomes after vascular surgery and confers an advantage.",

    "abstract": "As the first operational societal registry of carotid procedures, the Outcomes Committee of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) developed the Vascular Registry (VR) in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) National Coverage Decision on carotid artery stenting (CAS). Although CMS requires data submission only on CAS, the VR collects similar data on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to allow comparison of outcomes, as well as potential for expansion to other procedures.\nSVS-VR on-line provider-reported data include baseline through follow-up visits to better understand long-term risks and benefits associated with CAS and CEA. The primary outcomes are combined death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). An independent data coordinating center maintains the database, which is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant and auditable.\nAs of December 26, 2007, 6403 procedures with discharge data were entered by 287 providers at 56 centers on 2763 CAS patients (1450 with 30-day outcomes, 52.5%) and 3259 CEA patients (1368 with 30-day outcomes, 42%). Of the total cohort, 98% of CEA and 70.7% of CAS (P < .001) were performed for atherosclerotic disease. Restenosis accounted for 22.3% and post-radiation induced stenosis in 4.5% of CAS patients. Preprocedure lateralizing neurologic symptoms were present in a greater proportion of CAS patients (49.2%) than CEA patients (42.4%, P < .001). CAS patients also had higher preprocedure prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), MI, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiac arrhythmia. For CAS, death/stroke/MI at 30 days was 7.13% for symptomatic patients and 4.60% for asymptomatic patients (P = .04). For CEA, death/stroke/MI at 30 days was 3.75% in symptomatic patients and 1.97% in asymptomatic patients (P = .05). After risk-adjustment for age, history of stroke, diabetes, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (ie, factors found to be significant confounders in outcomes using backwards elimination), logistic regression analysis suggested better outcomes following CEA. There were no statistically significant differences when examining CAS outcomes based on center volume. CAS in atherosclerotic disease had significantly worse outcomes than in nonatherosclerotic stenosis. When CAS and CEA were compared in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease only, the difference in outcomes between the two procedures was more pronounced, with death/stroke/MI 6.42% after CAS vs 2.62% following CEA, P < .0001.\nFollowing best possible risk adjustment of these unmatched groups, symptomatic and asymptomatic CAS patients had significantly higher 30-day postprocedure incidence of death/stroke/MI when compared with CEA patients. The initial 1.5 years of data collection provide proof of concept that a specialty society based VR can succeed in meeting regulatory and scientific goals. With continued enrollment and follow-up, analysis of SVS-VR will supplement randomized trials by providing real-world comparisons of CAS and CEA with sufficient numbers to serve as an outcome assessment tool of important patient subsets and across the spectrum of peripheral vascular procedures.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of cranial and cervical nerve injury during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) ranges from less than 7.6% to more than 50%. Lesions are mainly due to surgical maneuvers such as traction, compression, tissue electrocoagulation, clamping, and extensive dissections. The use of dexamethasone (DEX) and its beneficial effects in spinal cord injuries have already been described. We investigated whether DEX could also be beneficial to minimize the incidence of cranial and cervical nerve injury during CEA.\nTo evaluate whether dexamethasone is able to reduce the incidence of cranial nerve injuries.\nFrom March 1999 through April 2006, 1126 patients undergoing CEA because of high-grade carotid stenosis were enrolled and randomized by predetermined randomization tables into two groups. The first group, \"A\", included 586 patients that all received an intravenous administration of dexamethasone following a therapeutic scheme. The second group, \"B\", included 540 control subjects that received the standard pre- and postoperative therapy. All patients were submitted to a deep cervical plexus block, eversion carotid endarterectomy, and selective shunting. Three days after the operation, an independent neurologist and otorhinolaryngologist evaluated the presence of cranial nerve deficits. All patients (group A and group B) showing nerve injuries continued the treatment (8 mg of dexamethasone once in the morning) for 7 days and were re-evaluated after 2 weeks, 30 days, and every 3 months for 1 year. Recovery time took from 2 weeks to 12 months, with a mean time of 3.6 months. The chi(2) test was used to compare the two groups and to check for statistical significance.\nThe incidence of cranial nerve dysfunction was higher in group B and the statistical analysis showed a significant effect of dexamethasone in preventing the neurological damage (P = .0081). The incidence of temporary lesions was lower in group A and the chi(2) test yielded a P value of .006. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the effect of dexamethasone in men and women. In addition, dexamethasone had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of permanent cranial nerve injuries. Finally, no adverse effect related to the administration of dexamethasone was observed.\nPerioperative administration of dexamethasone is effective in minimizing the incidence of temporary cranial nerve injuries during CEA.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate aortic volume changes in patients with acute type B aortic dissection (TBD), treated either by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) or conservatively.\nFrom July 1996 through March 2008, 76 patients presenting with acute TBD were referred to our department. To ensure a follow-up of at least 24 months, only 64 of them were included in the present study, with the cut-off for inclusion being March 2006. Twenty-nine of these patients underwent TEVAR and 35 patients underwent conservative treatment. Indications for TEVAR were life-threatening symptoms. Follow-up was performed postinterventionally in patients after TEVAR and at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter in both groups. It included clinical examinations, computed tomography (CT) scans, analysis of volume changes in true thoracic lumen (TTL), false thoracic lumen (FTL), thoracic lumen (TL), abdominal lumen (AL), and aortic diameter measurements. In addition, the extent of thrombosis and its influence on volume changes were assessed.\nMean follow-up was 41 months after TEVAR and 46 months in the conservatively-treated patients. At 60 months, cumulative rates of freedom from dissection-related death and rupture-free survival were 82.6% and 93.1% in the TEVAR group, respectively. They were 74.9% and 88.5% in the conservatively-treated group, respectively. In the conservatively-treated patients, 3 patients died of late aortic rupture, 4 were converted to open surgery, and 2 to TEVAR. Evaluation of volume changes showed better results in the TEVAR group within 24 months. However, within 60 months the difference between the two groups was no longer relevant. Relating to thrombosis of the FTL, analyses showed slightly better overall results and promotion of thrombus formation after TEVAR. However, at 60 months the results showed a tendency towards approximation between the two groups.\nOur data suggest that TEVAR seems to delay the natural course of the disease but not to stop it.",

In the conservatively-treated patients, 3 patients died of late aortic rupture, 4 were converted to open surgery, and 2 to TEVAR. Evaluation of volume changes showed better results in the TEVAR group within 24 months. However, within 60 months the difference between the two groups was no longer relevant. Relating to thrombosis of the FTL, analyses showed slightly better overall results and promotion of thrombus formation after TEVAR. However, at 60 months the results showed a tendency towards approximation between the two groups.",

    "abstract": "The distal part of the internal carotid artery (ICA) close to the skull base can be reached surgically with different approaches. Exposure using the standard lateral incision is eventually limited by bony structures which preclude the wide-angled operative field necessary for en bloc resection of tumors or primary vascular pathology that abuts the parapharyngeal space. In these unusual cases, use of a combined midline mandibulotomy and neck incision provides necessary operative exposure.\nWe report our experience using combined midline mandibulotomy and neck incision for exposure of high carotid lesions. We also discuss different surgical and endovascular approaches in light of the literature.\nFive patients were operated on for high ICA lesions: 2 for malignant head and neck tumors, 1 for an extended paraganglioma, and 2 for large symptomatic ICA aneurysms. All ICAs were reconstructed with an autologous vein interposition graft and the distal anastomoses were performed within the most distal 3 cm of the ICA adjacent to the orifice of bony carotid canal.\nAll operations were technically successful with no operative mortality or strokes. One aneurysm patient and the paraganglioma patient had minimal long-term sequelae from this procedure. One patient with an extended lingual epidermoid carcinoma was recurrence free at 3.6 years. One aneurysm patient died due to aspiration pneumonia 30 days postoperatively and another patient had early recurrent tumor growth and died due to that after 15 months. Four patients (80%) suffered a major cranial nerve injury in the operation mainly due to the extensive nature of the disease process.\nExposure of the distal carotid artery using midline mandibulotomy is rarely required. However, this technique represents an excellent option for cases of malignancies arising from the oral cavity which abut the carotid artery and instances in which primary carotid pathology extends medially alongside the parapharyngeal space. Performance of these cases should be accomplished by a multidisciplinary surgical team comprised of head and neck and vascular specialists. High rates of cranial nerve deficits should be anticipated.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study examines the relationship between the renal resistive index (RI) and blood pressure and renal function response after open and percutaneous intervention for atherosclerotic renovascular disease (AS-RVD).\nFrom March 1997 to December 2005, 86 patients (46 women, 40 men; mean age, 68 +/- 10 years) underwent renal duplex sonography (RDS), including main renal artery and hilar vessel Doppler interrogation, before treatment of AS-RVD. Of these, 56 patients had open operative repair, and 30 had percutaneous intervention. The RI (1-[EDV/PSV]) was calculated from the kidney with the highest peak systolic velocity (PSV). Hypertension response was graded from preprocedural and postprocedural blood pressure measurements and medication requirements. Renal function response was graded by a >or=20% change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from the serum creatinine concentration.\nComorbid conditions, baseline blood pressure, and preoperative renal function were not significantly different between open and percutaneous groups. Baseline characteristics that differed between the percutaneous vs open group were higher mean age (71 +/- 11 years vs 67 +/- 9 years; P = .05), kidney length (11.3 +/- 1.3 cm vs 10.7 +/- 1.2 cm; P = .02), proportion of patients with RI >or=0.8 (50% vs 21%; P = .01), and proportion of bilateral AS-RVD (37% vs 80%; P < .01). After controlling for preintervention blood pressure and extent of repair, postoperative eGFR differed significantly for RI <0.8 or >or=0.8 when all patients (P = .003) and percutaneous intervention (P = .008) were considered. Specifically, eGFR declined from preprocedure to postprocedure in the patients with RI >or=0.8 after percutaneous repair and in the group analyzed as a whole. Neither systolic nor diastolic pressure after intervention demonstrated an association with RI. Considering all patients and both groups, multivariable proportional hazards regression models demonstrated that RI was predictive of all-cause mortality. RI was the most powerful predictor of death during follow-up (hazard ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-17.2; P < .001).\nAfter intervention for AS-RVD, RI was associated with renal function, but not blood pressure response. A strong, independent relationship between RI and mortality was observed for all patients and both treatment groups.",

    "abstract": "Spinal fluid drainage reduces paraplegia risk in thoracic (TAA) and thoracoabdominal (TAAA) aortic aneurysm repair. There has not been a comprehensive study of the risks of spinal fluid drainage and how these risks can be reduced. Here we report complications of spinal fluid drainage in patients undergoing TAA/TAAA repair.\nThe study comprised 648 patients who had TAA or TAAA repair from 1987 to 2008. Spinal drains were used in 486 patients. Spinal fluid pressure was measured continuously, except when draining fluid, and was reduced to <6 mm Hg during thoracic aortic occlusion and reperfusion. After surgery, spinal fluid pressure was kept <10 mm Hg until patients were awake with normal leg lift. Drains were removed 48 hours after surgery. Spinal and head computed tomography (CT) scans were performed in patients with bloody spinal fluid or neurologic deficit. We studied the incidence of headache treated with epidural blood patch, infection, bloody spinal fluid, intracranial and spinal bleeding on CT, as well as the clinical consequences.\nTwenty-four patients (5%) had bloody spinal fluid. CT exams showed seven had no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, 14 (2.9%) had intracranial blood without neurologic deficit, and three with intracranial bleeding and cerebral atrophy had neurologic deficits (1 died, 1 had permanent hemiparesis, and 1 with transient ataxia recovered fully). Two patients without bloody spinal fluid or neurologic deficit after surgery presented with neurologic deficits 5 days postoperatively and died from acute on chronic subdural hematoma. Neurologic deficits occurred after spinal fluid drainage in 5 of 482 patients (1%), and 3 died. The mortality from spinal fluid drainage complications was 0.6% (3 of 482). By univariate and multivariate analysis, larger volume of spinal fluid drainage (mean, 178 mL vs 124 mL, P < .0001) and higher central venous pressure before thoracic aortic occlusion (mean, 16 mm Hg vs 13 mm Hg, P < .0012) correlated with bloody spinal fluid.\nStrategies that reduce the volume of spinal fluid drainage but still control spinal fluid pressure are helpful in reducing serious complications. Patients with cerebral atrophy are at increased risk for complications of spinal fluid drainage.",

    "abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) is a crucial outcome measure in patients with lower limb ischemia (LLI). The Short Form 36 (SF36) has been proposed as the gold standard instrument for generic QoL analysis in patients with LLI. The Short Form 8 (SF8) was developed from the SF36 and we aim to compare these two instruments in terms of validity, reliability, and responsiveness.\nOne hundred ninety-three patients, 135 men and 58 women, median age 66 (range, 44-84) years with LLI completed the SF36 and the SF8. Disease severity was graded according to International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (ISCVS) suggested reporting standards. Correlation between the two instruments' like domains and non-like domains reflects convergent and divergent validity respectively. A subgroup of 58 patients (44 men) completed two sets of questionnaires, with an intervening period of 2 weeks. Correlation between these two sets of questionnaires was used to analyze test/retest reliability. Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze validity and reliability. Responsiveness of the individual domains across the whole group was analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, while responsiveness between the groups of patients with varying severity of LLI was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.\nThere was greater correlation between like domains of SF36 and the SF8 than the non-like domains suggesting good convergent-divergent validity. Test/retest reliability was significant for both instruments (r(s) > 0.7). Increasing LLI resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in all eight domains of both instruments. The time taken was significantly shorter and less assistance was required to complete the SF8 than the SF36.\nThe SF8 is a valid and reliable QoL instrument in patients with LLI, and as it is simpler and quicker to complete, we suggest it may challenge the SF36 as the gold standard generic QoL analysis instrument in LLI.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) leads to frequent embolic brain lesions; their source has not been clearly identified yet. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we have evaluated embolic brain lesions (BL) after CAS and correlated them with aortic arch (AA) characteristics.\nThe AAs of 59 patients undergoing CAS under distal protection were evaluated by angiography and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). AAs were stratified according to morphology (type I and II \"simple\" vs type III and bovine \"difficult\"), atherosclerotic arch lesions (complicated: >5 mm or with mobile debris vs uncomplicated: <5 mm), and tortuosity index (TI; sum of all angles diverging from ideal carotid axis, <150 vs >150). Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed before and within 24 hours from CAS. New BL were considered ipsilateral (IL) if ipsilateral to the site of CAS and non-ipsilateral (CL) if contralateral to it or bilateral. Normality distribution was by Shapiro-Wilk test (variables reported as medians +/- interquartile range) and statistical significance (P < .05) by Wilcoxon and Fisher's exact test.\nDifficult arches were present in 17 patients (28.8%), complicated aortic plaque in 21 (35.5%), and TI > 150 in 34 (57.6%). New BL appeared in 34 or 57.6% patients (6 or 18% IL and 28 or 82% CL). The mean number of BL was 5.7 (range, 0 to 20), 4.7 IL, and 5.7 CL, with a median volume of 560.95 +/- 1677.7 mm(3). Type of arch and TI were not correlated with mean number of BL. Mean volume of BL were greater in patients with difficult AA, complicated plaques, and TI > 150 (258 (572) mm(3) vs 15.6 (353) mm(3), P = .2; and 86 (828) mm(3) vs 85.9 (352) mm(3), P = .4 172 (766) mm(3) vs 0 (228) mm(3), P = .06, respectively). In patients with all three AA characteristics, mean number and volume of BL was significantly greater compared with other patients. Specifically, this increase was due mainly to CL (IL 0 (117) mm(3) vs 0 (172) mm(3), P = .9; CL 564 (687) mm(3) vs 0 (133) mm(3), P = .001). None of the technical details considered was correlated with either IL or CL.\nBL are frequent after protected CAS and are correlated with AA characteristics, thus underlining the role of catheterization maneuvers in determining embolic events. TEE may be useful in patient's selection for CAS.",

    "abstract": "The most recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend that the order of preference for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) placement is the radial-cephalic primary AVF, followed by the secondary brachiocephalic (BC) and, if either of these is not viable, then brachiobasilic (BB) AVF should be fashioned. However, there is limited prospective data comparing technical and clinical outcomes of these two approaches. The purpose of our study was to compare outcome, patency, and complication rates in these two autogenous upper arm AV accesses.\nBetween December 2003 and and January 2007, patients (61 male, 39 female) who have lost more distal AVFs were enrolled in the study. After preoperative duplex mapping, patients with patent both basilic and cephalic veins greater than 3 mm of diameter were randomized into BCAVF and BBAVF groups, each group consisting of 50 patients. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia as one-stage procedures. Follow-up data were prospectively collected. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate primary and secondary patency rates. Univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis was used to find risks for the occurrence of thrombosis.\nBaseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and preoperative history dialysis access were comparable between groups with the exception of the fact that mean caliber of the basilic veins were larger (4.51 +/- 0.93 mm vs 3.90 +/- 0.1 mm; P = .002). The mean duration of operation was significantly shorter in the BC group compared with the BB group (P < .001). There was no significant difference in the thirty day mortality, wound complications, 24 hour thrombosis, postoperative hemorrhage, maturation, and time to maturation between the groups. Mean follow-up was 43.2 +/- 1.8 months. Primary patency at 1 and 3 years of follow-up was 87% and 81% for the BC group and 86% and 73% for the BB group (P = .7) Secondary patency at one and three year follow-up was 87% and 70% for the BC group and 88% and 71% for the BB group, respectively (P = .8). Twenty-eight patients (28%) in the BC (18 patients) and BB (10 patients) group died with a patent fistula during the follow-up period (P = .18). Multivariate analysis revealed that use of dominant arm increased the risk of fistula failure.\nWe conclude that brachiobasilic and brachiocephalic AVF are equally effective alternatives; however, a longer and demanding operation with BB AVF construction should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess the outcome of neovalve construction in two consecutive series of patients affected by postthrombotic syndrome and valve agenesis. The technique was modified in the second series so as to correct a cause of failure.\nBetween December 2000 and June 2007, 40 neovalve constructions were carried out in 36 patients (19 males, 17 females, median age 57, range, 29-82) affected by deep venous insufficiency. Thirty-two patients were affected by postthrombotic syndrome and 4 by valve agenesis. The 32 patients with postthrombotic syndrome were selected from among 76 patients with resistant ulcers classified C (6,S) E (S) A (S,D,P) P (R,RO) and the 4 patients with valve agenesis were selected from among 28 affected by resistant ulcers classified as C (6,S) E (C) A (S,D,P) P (R). The patients were subdivided into 2 groups. The first group included 19 operations performed in the period between December 2000 and December 2004, with a median follow-up of 54 months (range, 31-78). The second group included 21 patients operated on between January 2005 and June 2007, with a median follow-up of 5 months (range, 2-29). In the second group, a surgical variation was applied in order to prevent flap collapse and to maintain the continence of the neovalve.\nIn the first series, ulcer healing was observed in 16 cases out of 19 (84%). Recurrent ulcers were observed in one case after 3 years. Valve competence was ascertained in 13 cases per 803 patient-months (1.6/100 patient-months). With regard to the second series, competence was achieved in all cases with a cumulative rate of 21 per 228 patient-months (9.2/100 patient-months). In the second series, the ulcer failed to heal in one case and recurred in two cases, with an intention-to-treat ulcer recurrence rate of three cases per 209 patient-months. Postoperative deep-venous thrombosis was observed in 3 patients in the first series. None was detected in the second series. The mortality rate was 0 and in neither group was pulmonary embolism detected.\nThe modified technique applied to the second group seemed to improve valve continence results significantly.

    "abstract": "Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAAs) are rare vascular lesions, and large series with short-term and long-term outcomes are seldom reported. This study compared the clinical presentation and conventional treatment outcomes of different ECAA types according to their etiology.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the data of 55 consecutive patients (47 men, 8 women) with 61 ECAAs who were treated from January 1986 to December 2007 by conventional surgical techniques. The patients were a mean age of 65 +/- 11 years (range, 30-92 years). Thirty-two ECAAs (52.5%) occurred postoperatively after previous carotid endarterectomy, of which 26 patients had 29 degenerative aneurysms (47.5%). Clinical presentation included cerebral stroke in three patients (4.9%) and transient ischemic attack in 26 (42.7%). Mean follow-up was 42.7 +/- 22.0 months. Statistical analysis was performed within and between degenerative and post-reconstructive ECAA subgroups of patients.\nOpen aneurysm resection included 27 extended polytetrafluoroethylene interposition grafts, 12 venous grafts, and 22 closures using synthetic patch. Cumulative 1-year primary patency rates were 86.9% for the degenerative ECAAs and 96% for the postoperative ECAAs, with respective secondary patency rate at 5 years of 80% and 93.3%. The 5-year patency rate was 88.9% for synthetic grafts compared with 66.7% for vein grafts and 86.4% for synthetic patches. These differences were not statistically significant (P > .05). Complications for the degenerative ECAAs included two reconstruction thromboses <30 days, two cerebral strokes, and one myocardial infarction. The patients with postoperative ECAAs experienced one early thrombosis and two strokes postoperatively. Two patients (3.6%) from the degenerative ECAA subgroup died of cardiac decompensation (n = 1) and cerebral ischemic event (n = 1).\nDespite the different trends, no significant differences were found between degenerative ECAA and postoperative ECAA patients in clinical presentation, localization, and surgery outcomes. The good middle-term and long-term patency rates of synthetic graft reconstruction justify its use in the treatment of ECAAs, and it is less time consuming and technically demanding compared with vein interposition graft.",

    "abstract": "Infected aneurysm of the aorta is almost always fatal without undergoing aortic resection. Medical treatment was attempted selectively in patients who were considered too high risk for surgery. We review our experience with 22 patients treated without undergoing aortic resection over 12 years.\nRetrospective chart review.\nBetween 1995 and 2007, 22 cases of infected aortic aneurysms treated without undergoing aortic resection during the first admission were included. There were 17 men with a median age of 76 years (range, 35 to 88 years). Of 18 pathogens isolated, the most common responsible microorganism was nontyphoid Salmonella in 11 followed by Staphylococcus aureus in five. The site of infection was thoracic in eight and abdominal in 14. The hospital mortality rate was 50%, and the aneurysm-related mortality rate after long-term follow-up was 59%.

    "abstract": "Cumulative radiation dose, cost, and increased demand for computed tomography aortography (CTA) suggest that duplex ultrasonography (DU) may be an alternative to CTA-based surveillance. We compared CTA with DU during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) follow-up.\nPatients undergoing EVAR had clinical and radiological follow-up data entered in a prospectively maintained database. For the purpose of this study, the gold standard test for endoleak detection was CTA, and an endoleak detected on DU alone was assumed to be a false positive result. DU interpretation was performed independently of CTA and vice versa.\nOne hundred thirty-two patients underwent EVAR, of whom 117 attended for follow-up ranging from six months to nine years (mean, 32 months). Adequate aneurysm sac visualisation on DU was not possible in 1.7% of patients, predominantly due to obesity. Twenty-eight endoleaks were detected in 28 patients during follow-up. Of these, 24 were initially identified on DU (four false negative DU examinations), and eight had at least one negative CTA with a positive DU prior to diagnosis. Twenty-three endoleaks were type II in nature and three of these patients had increased sac size. There was one type I and four type III endoleaks. Two of these (both type III) had an increased sac size. Of 12 patients with increased aneurysm size of 5 mm or more at follow-up, five had an endoleak visible on DU, yet negative CTA and a further five had endoleak visualisation on both DU and CTA. Of six endoleaks which underwent re-intervention, all were initially picked up on DU. One of these endoleaks was never demonstrated on CTA and a further two had at least one negative CTA prior to endoleak confirmation. Positive predictive value for DU was 45% and negative predictive value 94%. Specificity of DU for endoleak detection was 67% when compared with CTA, because of the large number of false positive DU results. Sensitivity for DU was 86%, with all clinically significant endoleaks demonstrated on CTA also detected on DU.\nDespite its low positive predictive value, we found DU to be a sensitive test for the detection of clinically significant endoleaks. Given concerns about cumulative radiation exposure and cost, and the surprisingly low sensitivity of CTA for endoleak detection in this series, selective CTA based on DU surveillance may be a more appropriate long-term strategy.",

    "abstract": "Use of motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) monitoring during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery is controversial. This study evaluated the intraoperative use of SSEP and MEP during thoracoabdominal repair and assessed their role in decreasing the risk of spinal cord ischemia and paralysis.\nWe conducted paired SSEP and MEP monitoring to assess agreement between the methods and their ability to predict neurologic outcome in 233 patients. Changes in SSEP and MEP monitoring were classified as no change, reversible change, or irreversible change during the intraoperative period and by the conclusion of surgery. Agreement between the methods was computed using the Cohen kappa statistic. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were computed for each method on the immediate and delayed neurologic deficit.\nImmediate neurologic deficit, determined immediately upon awakening from anesthesia and confirmed by a neurologist, occurred in eight of 233 (3.4%) patients. For any change (reversible plus irreversible), agreement between MEP and SSEP was relatively low (kappa = 0.53), despite being highly statistically significant (P < .001). MEP tended to overestimate SSEP for immediate neurologic deficit, demonstrating a 53% false-positive rate, compared with a 33% false-positive rate for SSEP (specificity ratio, 1.42; P < .0001). With irreversible change, agreement between the methods was 90% (kappa = 0.896, P < .0001). Only irreversible change was significantly associated with neurologic outcome (odds ratio, 21.9; P < .00001 for SSEP; 60.8, P < .0001 for MEP), but sensitivity and positive predictive values were low (37% and 33% for SSEP; 22% and 45% for MEP, respectively). Reversible changes in neurophysiologic monitoring were not significantly associated with immediate neurologic deficit. Negative predictive values for all negative evoked potential findings were >98% for immediate deficit. No evoked potential variables were associated with delayed deficit.\nSSEP and MEP monitoring were highly correlated only when intraoperative changes were irreversible. Reversible changes were not significantly associated with immediate neurologic deficit. Irreversible changes were significantly associated with immediate neurologic deficit, and the findings were identical for SSEP and MEP in this variable, indicating that the more complex MEP measures do not add further information to that obtained from SSEP. Normal SSEP and MEP findings had a strong negative predictive value, indicating that patients without signal loss are unlikely to awake with neurologic deficit.",

    "abstract": "Postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been reported to have more adverse outcomes after vascular reconstructions, including increased intimal hyperplasia development and bypass graft failure. HRT may be affecting the pathway contributing to intimal hyperplasia. An important component of this pathway involves matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), implicated in vascular remodeling due to their ability to degrade components of the extracellular matrix. We hypothesize that estrogen (Est) and progesterone (Prog) upregulate the MMP pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) thereby increasing MMP activity and function.\nVSMCs were incubated with Est (5 ng/mL), Prog (50 ng/mL), Est + Prog combination (Est/Prog), and/or doxycycline (40 microg/mL; Doxy). Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis we have previously shown membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels are significantly increased by Est. Here, Western blot analyses indicated MT1-MMP and MMP-2 protein levels, not tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2), were increased in response to Est and Est/Prog (P < .05 vs control). In-gel zymography revealed that Est and Est/Prog resulted in increased MMP-2 activity (hormone groups, P < .05 vs control) with no significant difference among the hormone groups. VSMC migration was increased by 45 +/- 14% in response to Est (P < .05 vs control), as measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Doxycycline significantly inhibited basal and Est/Prog-stimulated increases in MMP-2 activity (P < .05 vs control; P < .05 vs hormone groups), and partially blocked basal and hormonally stimulated migration (P < .05 vs control and Est).\nEstrogen and progesterone affects the MMP pathway by increasing MMP-2 enzymatic activity, possibly via the upregulation of MT1-MMP expression without a corresponding increase in TIMP expression. This increased collagenase activity increases VSMC motility and their ability to migrate through a collagen type IV lattice. Est/Prog upregulation of MT1-MMP may contribute to the adverse effect of HRT on vascular interventions.",

    "abstract": "Subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an elevated prevalence of carotid stenosis and of silent myocardial ischaemia. As such, clinical guidelines advocate the detection of sub-clinical vascular disease in this population. However, the prevalence of occult vascular disease in asymptomatic patients with a low ankle-brachial index (ABI) has not been previously evaluated.\nCross-sectional study in five primary care centres for patients' selection and two University Hospitals for further assessment. Subjects were 1070 asymptomatic individuals between 60 and 80 years of age with at least two cardiovascular risk factors, selected for ankle-brachial index measurement. Eighty five subjects with an ABI <0.9 and an equal number of controls, matched for age, gender, diabetes, and smoking habit, and with a normal ABI, were referred to the Hospital for carotid ultrasound and exercise stress tests (EST). Main outcome measures were prevalence of a carotid stenosis >50% and an abnormal EST.\nThe prevalence of a low ABI in the overall population was 9.1%. A carotid stenosis >50% was detected in 14.3% of the subjects with a low ABI and in 4.7% of the control subjects (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.37; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.04-10.93, P = .033).

These prevalences were higher in older subjects, in those with hypertension or diabetes, or in those with dyslipidemia.\nOur results indicate that in high-risk asymptomatic subjects >60 years of age, the presence of an ABI <0.9 identifies a subgroup of the population with an increased prevalence of carotid stenosis and of silent myocardial ischemia and, as such, are candidates for closer follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Remote ischemic preconditioning is a physiologic mechanism in mammalian species whereby brief exposure to nonlethal ischemia in one tissue confers protection against a prolonged ischemic insult in a distant tissue. First described almost 15 years ago, it has been slow to translate into clinical practice. Several clinical trials have recently reported that remote ischemic preconditioning reduces myocardial injury after major cardiovascular surgery. In addition, a randomized trial in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair reported a significant reduction in perioperative myocardial infarctions. Remote ischemic preconditioning is easily performed and likely to prove highly cost-effective. large-scale trials of the technique are warranted in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Except for compression therapy, physical therapy has scarcely been evaluated in the treatment of chronic venous disorders (CVD). Spa treatment is a popular way to administer physical therapy for CVD in France, but its efficacy has not been evaluated yet. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of balneotherapy associated with patient education, as performed in the spa resort of La L\u00e9ch\u00e8re, in patients with advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP clinical classes C4/C5).\nThe study was a randomized controlled trial, spa therapy being administered on top of the usual medical care. Evaluation was by a blinded independent investigator. Subjects were patients with primary or post-thrombotic CVD with skin changes but no active ulcer (C4a, C4b, or C5), living in Grenoble area, and willing to undergo a spa treatment course in La L\u00e9ch\u00e8re. The treated group had the three week spa treatment course in La L\u00e9ch\u00e8re, soon after randomization; the control group also had a spa treatment, but starting at day 365. The treatment consisted of four balneology sessions per day, six days a week during three weeks, and three educational workshops. An independent follow-up was performed in Grenoble hospital every three months for 15 months. The main outcome criterion was the severity of the skin changes, as evaluated by means of malleolar chromametry. Quality of life, as measured by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 scale, a visual analog scale (VAS) for leg symptoms, and the occurrence of leg ulcers were used as secondary criteria. The year after spa treatment in the treated group was compared with the year before spa treatment in the control group.\nFifty-nine subjects were enrolled (29 in the treatment group and 30 in the control group). No statistically significant difference between groups was found at study onset regarding age, sex, etiology, CEAP \"C\" class, and the outcome variables. After treatment, chromametry showed significantly decreased pigmentation and erythema in the treatment group compared with the controls (P < .01). Quality of life (P < .01) and symptoms (P < .001) also improved significantly. These differences remained significant after one year follow-up. The control patients improved similarly after their own spa treatment (day 450).\nThis study shows that spa therapy, associating balneotherapy and patient education, is able to improve significantly the skin trophic changes of the CVD patients and their CVD related quality of life and symptoms. This effect is of large magnitude and remains significant one year after the treatment course.",

    "abstract": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of cardiovascular disease. The objective was to determine if abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and CRP serum concentration and its CRP gene are associated.\nAAA patients and AAA negative controls were recruited. CRP concentration was measured and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3091244, assessed. AAA cases were divided into those measuring 30-55 mm and >55 mm in diameter, to assess correlation of CRP with AAA size. A total of 248 (227 male) cases and 400 (388 male) controls were included. CRP concentration was higher in cases (385.0 microl/dL [310.4-442.8] vs 180.3 microl/dL [168.1-196.9]; P < .0001). It was higher in large aneurysms (685.7 microl/dL [511.8-1083.0] vs 291.0 microl/dL [223.6-349.6]; P < .0001), with significant correlation observed to size (r = 0.37, P < .0001). CC was the most common SNP genotype with no difference in distribution (P = .43) between cases and controls. No difference existed in CRP for each genotype in the overall cohort (P = .17), cases (P = .18) and controls (P = .19).\nThe results demonstrate that CRP production may be related to the presence of AAA, especially in advanced disease. The serum concentration of CRP does not appear to be influenced by the functional SNP of the CRP gene, which also appears to have no association with AAA formation.",

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive techniques such as endovenous laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy are widely used in the treatment of lower extremity varicosities. These therapies have not yet been compared with surgical ligation and stripping in large randomized clinical trials.\nA systematic review of Medline, Cochrane Library, and Cinahl was performed to identify studies on the effectiveness of the four therapies up to February 2007. All clinical studies (open, noncomparative, and randomized clinical trials) that used ultrasound examination as an outcome measure were included. Because observational and randomized clinical trial data were included, both the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Quality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses (QUORUM) guidelines were consulted. A random effects meta-analysis was performed, and subgroup analysis and meta-regression were done to explore sources of between-study variation.\nOf the 119 retrieved studies, 64 (53.8%) were eligible and assessed 12,320 limbs. Average follow-up was 32.2 months. After 3 years, the estimated pooled success rates (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for stripping, foam sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and laser therapy were about 78% (70%-84%), 77% (69%-84%), 84% (75%-90%), and 94% (87%-98%), respectively. After adjusting for follow-up, foam therapy and radiofrequency ablation were as effective as surgical stripping (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.12 [95% CI, -0.61 to 0.85] and 0.43 [95% CI, -0.19 to 1.04], respectively). Endovenous laser therapy was significantly more effective compared with stripping (AOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.40-1.87), foam therapy (AOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.28-1.75), and radiofrequency ablation (AOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.15-1.27).\nIn the absence of large, comparative randomized clinical trials, the minimally invasive techniques appear to be at least as effective as surgery in the treatment of lower extremity varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "Often groin recurrences after varicose vein surgery are diagnosed and classified with the help of a duplex ultrasound scan. There are, however, no studies indicating if duplex ultrasound scans can reliably distinguish between the different forms of recurrent vessels, ie, neovascularization or a residual stump. To address this issue, we have conducted a prospective study in which ultrasound scan assessment of groin recurrences was compared to the histological classification of the recurrent groin veins.\nAll patients undergoing redo-surgery for symptomatic groin recurrences after previous stripping of the greater saphenous vein (GSV) during a 1-year period (May 2006-May 2007) were included in the study. Preoperatively, all patients had a duplex-ultrasound scan examination of the groin vessels. Based on the duplex scan findings, the recurrent veins in the groin were classified as either a residual stump or neovascularization. During the redo-surgery, a specimen of the recurrent groin veins was obtained and underwent histologic evaluation. Based on histologic criteria, the recurrence was also classified as a residual stump or neovascularization.\nDuring the 1-year study period, 125 groin recurrences in 95 consecutive patients (74 female, 21 male, mean age 58.7 years, standard deviation [SD] 10.3 years) were included. In the 119 cases where both duplex-ultrasound scan and histological evaluation were available, a residual stump was seen at the histological examination in 80.7% of cases, a neovascularization in 10.9% of cases, and a combination of both entities in 8.4% of cases. Duplex-ultrasound scan classified the recurrent groin veins as a residual stump in 68.1% of cases, as neovascularization in 26.1%, and as a combination of both in 5.8% of cases. With histological classification as the gold-standard, duplex ultrasound scans reached a sensitivity of 77.1% and a positive predictive value of 91.4% in correctly identifying a residual stump as the cause of recurrence. For the correct classification of neovascularization, sensitivity was 61.5% and the positive predictive value 25.8%, while a combination of both was recognized with a sensitivity of 10% and a positive predictive value of 14.3%.\nWhile duplex-ultrasound scan is a reliable tool to diagnose groin recurrences after varicose vein surgery, its validity in classifying the different types of recurrent groin vessels is limited. Especially the correct identification of neovascularization which is poor with a sensitivity of 62% and a positive predictive value of 26%. Histological examination should still be regarded as the gold-standard when trying to differentiate between different types of groin recurrences.",

    "abstract": "Forearm artery lesions are a frequent cause of distal fistula maturation failure. Surgical treatment is difficult because of highly calcified arteries. To redo the arteriovenous anastomosis higher up the forearm is technically difficult and often ineffective because arteries cannot be enlarged. It also causes a loss in puncture zone. Creation of brachial accesses leads to a high risk of distal ischemia.\nFrom September 2000 to September 2006, we performed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of forearm arteries in 25 patients with failing distal access maturation. We reported immediate results of the dilatation and retrospectively analyzed the outcome of the accesses after the procedure.\nForearm artery PTA was achieved in all 25 patients. Three main complications occurred: severe spasms precluding precise assessment of the artery patency after dilatation, rupture easily treated by prolonged low-pressure balloon inflation, and early rethrombosis leading to access loss. Follow-up was available in 23 patients. PTA failed to restore a sufficient access flow in two patients (the access loss and an insufficient increase in flow). In the remaining 21 (91%), accesses started to be used for hemodialysis without difficulties. Primary patency access rates after PTA were 83% (range, 60%-93%) at 1 year and 74% (range, 47%-89%) at 2 years. Secondary access patency rates were 86% (range, 64%-95%) at 1 and 3 years.\nWhen a distal access fails to mature because of forearm artery lesions, PTA should be done and will salvage the fistula without risk of distal ischemia and cardiac failure. Efficacy of PTA clearly influences surgical strategy and is a major argument in favor of attempting to create distal accesses in patients with mild distal artery lesions. Even in cases of failure, such as early occlusion of the fistula, this technique does not jeopardize further proximal access creation. Forearm access creation should be avoided only in cases of extremely severe distal artery lesions.",

    "abstract": "The impact of risk factors upon perioperative mortality might differ for patients undergoing open vs endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). In order to investigate this, we developed a differential predictive model of perioperative mortality after AAA repair.\nA total of 45,660 propensity score matched Medicare beneficiaries undergoing elective open or endovascular AAA repair from 2001 to 2004 were studied. Using half the dataset we developed a multiple logistic regression model for a matched cohort of open and EVAR patients and used this to derive an easily evaluable risk prediction score. The remainder of the dataset formed a validation cohort used to confirm results.\nThe derivation cohort included 11,415 open and 11,415 endovascular repairs. Perioperative mortality was 5.3% and 1.8%, respectively. Independent predictors of mortality (relative risk [RR], 95% confidence interval [CI]) were open repair (3.2, 2.7-3.8); age (71-75 years 1.2, 0.9-1.6; 76-80 years 1.9, 1.4-2.5; >80 years 3.1, 2.4-4.2); female gender (1.5, 1.3-1.8); dialysis (2.6, 1.5-4.6); chronic renal insufficiency (2.0, 1.6-2.6); congestive heart failure (1.7, 1.5-2.1); and vascular disease (1.3, 1.2-1.6). There were no differential predictors of mortality across the two procedures. A simple scoring system was developed from a logistic regression model fit to both endovascular and open patients (area under the receiver operator curve [ROC] curve of 72.6) from which low, medium, and high risk groups were developed. The absolute predicted mortality ranged from 0.7% for an EVAR patient </=70 years of age with no comorbidities to 38% for an open patient >80 with all the comorbidities considered. Although relative risk was similar among age groups, the absolute difference was greater for older patients (with higher baseline risk).\nMortality after AAA repair is predicted by comorbidities, gender, and age, and these predictors have similar effects for both methods of AAA repair. This simple scoring system can predict repair mortality for both treatment options and thus may help guide clinical decisions.",

    "abstract": "To examine contemporary operative techniques and outcomes for repair of isolated iliac artery aneurysms.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent repair of an isolated iliac artery aneurysm from February 1995 to June 2007. Mycotic aneurysms and patients with concurrent infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms greater than 3.5 cm in diameter were excluded from analysis. Patients with prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were not excluded.\nFifty-six patients (96% male; mean age, 72 +/- 10 years) had either open (n = 24) or endovascular (n = 32) repair with median follow-up of 36 months. Seven patients were treated for rupture, six with open repair, and one with an endograft. Average aneurysm size for patients in the open and endovascular repair cohorts was 4.5 +/- 2.4 cm and 4.0 +/- 1.1 cm, respectively (P = .35). One episode of endograft limb thrombosis at five months was treated with catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy and stent placement. Thirty-day mortality for patients undergoing elective and emergent open repair was 1/18 (6%) and 1/6 (17%), respectively. There was no 30-day mortality for the endovascular group. Median length of stay was 10.5 days in the open group and one day in the endovascular elective group (P < .01). There was no mid-term aneurysm-related mortality in either group. Primary patency rates were similar between the open and endovascular groups at five years (100% vs. 96%, P = .07). Aneurysm sac diameter decreased in 67% (21/28) of patients that underwent endovascular repair. One patient with a Type III endoleak required relining of the endograft with a second endograft at 72 months.\nThese data demonstrate that in appropriately selected patients, endovascular repair of isolated iliac artery aneurysms is a safe, effective alternative to open repair with mid-term follow-up. Endovascular repair is associated with a significantly reduced hospital length of stay and may be associated with decreased need for transfusion and mortality when compared with open repair.",

    "abstract": "Compression therapy is the most widely used treatment for venous leg ulcers and it was used in different forms for more than 400 years. Published healing rates of venous ulcers obtained with compression therapy vary widely from 40-95%. According to numerous studies, it has been suggested that the application of external pressure to the calf muscle raises the interstitial pressure resulting in improved venous return and reduction in the venous hypertension. Several risk factors have been identified to be correlated with the failure of venous leg ulcers to heal with compression therapy (longer ulcer duration; large surface area; fibrinous deposition present on >50% of the wound surface and an Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) of <0.85.\nAn open prospective single-center study was performed in order to determine possible risk factors associated with the failure of venous ulcers to heal when treated with multi-layer high compression bandaging system for 52 weeks. In the study, 189 patients (101 women, 88 men; mean age 61 years) with venous leg ulcers (ulcer surface >5 cm(2); duration >3 months) were included. The study excluded patients with arterial disease (ABPI <0.8), heart insufficiency with ejection fraction (EF) <35, pregnancy, cancer disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes. Based on clinical opinion and available literature, the following were considered as potential risk factors: sex, age, ulceration surface, time since ulcer onset, previous operations, history of deep vein thrombosis, body mass index (BMI), reduction in calf circumference >3 cm during the first 50 days of treatment, walking distance during the day <200 meters, calf:ankle circumference ratio <1.3, fixed ankle joint, history of surgical wound debridement, >50% of wound covered with fibrin, depth of the wound >2 cm.\nWithin 52 weeks of limb-compression therapy, 24 (12.7%) venous ulcers had failed to heal. A small ulceration surface (<20 cm(2)), the duration of the venous ulcer <12 months, a decrease in calf circumference of more than 3 cm, and emergence of new skin islets on >10% of wound surface during the first 50 days of treatment were favorable prognostic factors for ulcer healing. A large BMI (>33 kg/m(2)), short walking distance during the day (<200 m), a history of wound debridement, and ulcers with deepest presentation (>2 cm) were indicators of slow healing. Calf:ankle circumference ratio <1.3, fixed ankle joint, and reduced ankle range of motion were the only independent parameters associated with non-healing (P < .001).\nThe results obtained in this study suggest that non-healing venous ulcers are related to the impairment of the calf muscle pump.",

All patients with evidence of renal artery pathology including duplex scan assessed peak systolic velocity (PSV) <50 or >200 cm/s, renal aortic ratio (RAR) >3.5, elevation of the serum creatinine >30%, computed tomography (CT) evidence of renal stenosis underwent further analyses including medical chart review, and a review of CT and duplex scan imaging data.

Mean follow-up was 25 months.

Secondary interventions were performed in 20% of the patients who developed stenoses. Only one of the detected stenoses that was not treated with a secondary intervention progressed to occlusion. Duplex scan criteria derived from ROC analysis correlating with curved planar reconstruction (CPR) from axial imaging data calculated a 60-99% in-stent stenosis to be associated with a PSV >280 cm/s or RAR >4.5. Occlusions were best identified by a mid renal artery PSV <57 cm/s in conjunction with an RAR <1.2.\nRevised ultrasound scan criteria have been developed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive interrogation of renal stents following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).

    "abstract": "Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) often develop common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms. We wished to assess the natural history of the CIA in the presence of an AAA and develop a model to predict CIA growth.\nData were gathered at a single center from 1996 to 2006 in patients undergoing AAA surveillance. Maximum size of AAA and both CIAs at yearly intervals were collected. CIA > 16 mm was defined as being an aneurysm. A mixed effects regression model was generated to predict CIA growth rates.\nOne hundred ninety-one patients with AAA underwent duplex ultrasound on at least two occasions (median, 4; range, 2-11). Average baseline CIA was 12 mm (standard deviation, 5.0); 41% of patients had one CIA over 16 mm. A CIA > 16 mm was more likely to expand (81% vs 53%, P = .0001) particularly in patients with an AAA that expanded (73% vs 43%, P = .0005). A larger AAA was associated with a larger CIA (P = .0341). CIA growth rate was proportional to baseline size. A CIA of 16 mm was predicted to take 10 years to reach 25 mm (156% or 5.6% per annum) or if 23 mm at baseline 10 years to reach 35 mm (152% or 5.2% per annum). Overall, a CIA was predicted to increase in diameter by 5.7% (+/- 0.5%) per annum.\nThe CIA in the presence of an AAA expands over time. CIA > 16 mm are more likely to increase. Routine duplex examination of a CIA less than 16 mm may not be necessary when following up AAA. These data may be used to aid planning and intervention during AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the outcome of adjunctive renal artery stenting for renal artery coverage at the time of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nBetween August 2000 and August 2008, 29 patients underwent elective EVAR using bifurcated Zenith stent grafts (Cook, Indianapolis, Ind) and simultaneous renal artery stenting. Renal artery stenting during EVAR was performed with endograft \"encroachment\" on the renal artery ostium (n = 23) or placement of a renal stent parallel to the main body of the endograft (\"snorkel,\" n = 8). Follow-up included routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), multiview abdominal radiographs, and serum creatinine measurement at 1, 6, and 12 months, and then yearly thereafter.\nThirty-one renal arteries were stented successfully in 29 patients. The 18 patients with planned renal artery stent placement had a proximal neck length <15 mm. Mean proximal neck length was shorter in patients who underwent the \"snorkel\" technique (6.9 +/- 3.1 mm) compared with those with planned endograft encroachment (9.9 +/- 2.6 mm). None of the patients with unplanned endograft encroachment had neck lengths <15 mm (mean length, 26.3 +/- 10.2 mm). Mean proximal neck angulation was 42.8 degrees +/- 24.0 degrees and did not differ between the groups. One patient had a type I endoleak on completion angiography, and two additional patients had a type I endoleak on the first postoperative CT scan. All type I endoleaks resolved by the 1-month postoperative CT scan. The primary assisted patency of renal artery stents was 100% at a median follow-up of 12.5 months (range, 2 days-77.4 months). In one patient near occlusion of a renal artery stent was noted on follow-up CT scan at 9 months; patency was restored by placement of an additional stent. One patient required dialysis after sustained hypotension from a right external iliac artery injury that resulted in prolonged postoperative bleeding. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 mg/dL at baseline, 1.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dL at 1 month of follow-up, and 1.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dL at 2 years of follow-up. There were no late type I endoleaks (>1 month postoperatively) or stent graft migrations.\nAdjunctive renal artery stenting during endovascular AAA repair using the \"encroachment\" and \"snorkel\" techniques is safe and effective. Short- and medium-term primary patency rates are excellent, but careful follow-up is needed to determine the durability of these techniques.",

Expected duplex scan findings in SMA bypass grafts have been recently reported. There is, however, little information correlating duplex scans from stented SMAs to procedural angiograms in patients treated for high-grade (>or=70%) SMA stenosis. We report validation of duplex scan criteria for high-grade native artery SMA stenosis, and also duplex scan examined results after SMA stent placement correlated with angiograms and angiographic measured pressure gradients pre- and post-SMA stent placement.\nThirty-five patients with symptoms consistent with mesenteric ischemia were treated with SMA stents. Pre-intervention angiography demonstrated >70% SMA stenosis or SMA occlusion in all but 3 patients. Pre-intervention pressure gradients were obtained in 20 stenotic but patent SMAs and averaged 57 +/- 38 mm Hg; range, 15 to 187 mm Hg. Eighteen of the patients had SMA duplex scan prior to angiography, and 17 demonstrated an SMA PSV >or=275 cm/second or no flow, (mean 450 +/- 152 cm/second in patent arteries; range, 256 to 770 cm/second). Post-stent placement angiography demonstrated <30% SMA stenosis in all 35 patients. Post-stent pressure gradients were obtained in 22 patients and averaged 11 +/- 13 mm Hg; range, 0 to 45 mm Hg, (P < .001 compared to pre-stent pressure gradients in a paired test) and were elevated in patients with >or=60% celiac artery stenosis compared with those with <60% celiac artery stenosis (P < .006). Mean early post-stent duplex PSV scans obtained in 13 patients, were 336 +/- 45 cm/second; range, 279 to 416 cm/second (P = .011 compared to pre-stent PSVs).\nSMA stenting provides good anatomic results and significantly reduces measured pressure gradients. Duplex scans measured SMA PSVs are reduced post-stent placement but despite good angiographic results remain above criteria predicting high-grade native artery SMA stenosis. Duplex scan criteria developed to identify high-grade native artery SMA stenosis accurately predict high-grade native artery SMA stenosis but overestimate stenosis in stented SMAs. New duplex scan criteria are required to predict high-grade stenosis in stented SMAs.",

    "abstract": "Low intra-aneurysm sac pressure has been shown to correlate with sac shrinkage following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) whereas high pressure results in sac enlargement. The Resilient AneuRx (RSA) has higher density Dacron compared with the standard AneuRx (STA) and was developed in an attempt to reduce type 4 and 5 endoleaks, thereby more effectively reducing sac pressure. The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of RSA and STA in reducing sac pressure in a chronic canine aneurysm model.\nArtificial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) aneurysm (26 x 50 mm) with an Endosure wireless pressure sensor (CardioMEMS, Atlanta, Ga) attached to the inner surface was implanted in the abdominal aorta of 10 mongrel dogs. Two weeks after creation of the aneurysm, each animal underwent EVAR with either STA (n = 5) or RSA (n = 5). Following EVAR, intra-sac pressure was measured with the implanted wireless pressure sensor up to 3 months postoperatively when the animals were sacrificed.\nEVAR was successful with no signs of an endoleak in all 10 dogs. Pressure sensing with the wireless sensor was also successful in each animal until the end of the study. Systolic intra-sac pressure remained at a high level in the STA group, whereas it gradually lowered over time in the RSA group. This difference reached statistical significance at 2 months and lasted to 3 months. No endoleak was detected in either group at the time of sacrifice. Gross analysis confirmed that all the aneurysm sacs were thrombosed without any flow inside the sac.\nDespite absence of an endoleak, intra-sac pressure remained high in the STA group. RSA effectively reduced sac pressure over time. Graft porosity appears to be an important factor that may determine the outcome of EVAR. These findings may be useful in designing improved endograft.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of endovascular aneurysm repair, a greater proportion of open aneurysm repairs in the future are expected to be more complex and require suprarenal cross-clamping. We sought to evaluate the effects of suprarenal (SR) vs infrarenal (IR) aortic cross-clamp position in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in an updated single center series.\nAll elective open AAA repairs performed at our institution between 1990 and 2006 were entered into a prospective database and reviewed retrospectively. Our main stratification variable was SR vs IR. The SR group was further subdivided into those requiring an adjunctive renal revascularization procedure (SR+RRP; n = 54) and those who did not (SR-RRP; n = 117). Univariate and multivariate models were used to analyze the effect of baseline variables and operative variables on our primary endpoint 30-day mortality as well as secondary endpoints such as major adverse events, postoperative decline in renal function (defined as doubling of baseline creatinine to level >2 mg/dL, or new-onset dialysis) and long-term survival. A propensity score model was developed to control for confounding variables associated with the use of an SR cross-clamp.\nA total of 1020 patients underwent elective AAA repair, of which 849 (83.2%) were IR and 171 (16.8%) were SR. Diabetes (14.6% vs 9.1%, P = .027), hypertension (70.2% vs 61.4%, P = .03), and chronic renal failure (14.0% vs 4.7%, P = .001) were more prevalent in the SR group, and mean aneurysm size was larger (6.0 cm vs 5.6 cm, P = .001). Estimated blood loss was higher (1919 mL vs 1257 mL, P = .001) in the SR group, as was mean length of stay (12.6 days vs 10.7 days, P = .047). Perioperative (30-day) mortality rate was 1.8% for the SR group and 1.2% for the IR group (P = .44). Postoperative decline in renal function was 17.0% in SR vs 9.5% in IR (P = .003), however, new-onset dialysis was rare (0.6% SR, 0.8% IR, P = NS). The combination of SR+RRP was associated with an increased risk for postoperative decline in renal function (14.8% SR+RRP, 4.3% SR-RRP, P = .016). Preoperative renal failure was strongly associated with postoperative renal decline (odds ratio [OR] 8.15, 2.92-22.8, P < .0001). Propensity score analysis demonstrated that the use of an SR cross-clamp was associated with an increased risk for postoperative renal decline (OR 2.66, 1.28-5.50, P = .009). Major adverse events were more prevalent in the SR group compared to the IR group (17.0% vs 9.5%, P = .003). Five-year survival was 69.1% + 1.9% for the IR group and 67.7% + 4.3% for the SR group (P = 0.38) by life table analysis.\nSuprarenal cross-clamping is associated with low mortality and significant but acceptable morbidity, including postoperative decline in renal function.

The jugular vein was interposed in the carotid artery in reversed fashion for 4 weeks and intimal hyperplasia of the grafted vein was measured (n = 8, in each group). Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was tested by precontraction with prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha), 5 muM) (n = 5, in each). endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and superoxide production of these veins were also assessed.\nThe suppression of intimal hyperplasia was significantly greater in the sarpogrelate-treated group than in the control group. ACh induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation in the sarpogrelate-treated group (but not in the control group). In endothelium-intact strips from the sarpogrelate-treated group, the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor nitroarginine enhanced the PGF(2alpha)-induced contraction and blocked the ACh-induced relaxation. Immunoreactive eNOS protein expression was similar between the two groups but superoxide production (estimated from ethidium fluorescence) in endothelial cells was significantly smaller in the sarpogrelate-treated group.\nThe present results indicate that in vivo blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors leads to an inhibition of intimal hyperplasia in rabbit vein graft. It is suggested that an increased function of endothelium-derived NO through a reduction in endothelial superoxide production may be a possible underlying mechanism for this. These novel findings support the clinical usefulness of sarpogrelate for preventing intimal hyperplasia in vein graft after bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "Choices for embolic protection during carotid stent procedures include distal filtration (DF) and proximal occlusion with flow reversal (POFR). DF devices are widely used but have produced only modest improvements in clinical outcomes. There is less experience with POFR devices but single center reports suggest reduced emboli detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD). To determine if POFR offers a significant improvement in embolic protection, we tested five DF devices and two POFR devices with 8F and 10F sheath design in an ex vivo angioplasty system using human carotid plaques excised en bloc. Physiologic pressures and flows were used and the efficiency of plaque fragment removal by these devices compared.\nThirty-three human carotid plaques removed en bloc were secured in tailored polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. The distal PTFE was either 6 mm or 5 mm inner diameter (ID). Saline was delivered through the excised carotid plaque as follows: a cleaning 50 mL flush was done prior to the angioplasty procedure and discarded; further flushes of forward flow were done with five pressurized \"pulsations\" of 10 mL each (50 mL), peak pressure 140 mm Hg. Balloon angioplasty was done with a 4 mm and then a 6 mm balloon. DF flushes were applied after each angioplasty and \"postprocedure\" after the device was removed. With POFR, 50 mL were collected through the sheath after balloon angioplasty by either back-pressure of 20 mm Hg, 40 mm Hg or 60 mm Hg, or by aspiration. Postangioplasty pressurized forward flush of 50 or 100 mL was done as described. Each flush was collected, centrifuged, and examined for plaque fragments. Fragments greater than 60 microns were sized and counted on a 100 micron grid.\nWhen DF devices were used in 6 mm lumen PTFE, the percent of fragments trapped was poor (13.7% to 27.8%). There were no statistically significant differences between the devices. The capture of fragments improved (22% vs 51.4%, P < .001) when devices appropriate for a 6 mm lumen were used in a 5 mm PTFE \"ICA\", functionally over-sizing the devices. POFR efficiency improved with increasing back-pressures and with repeated aspirations. Postprocedure, successive flushes of pressurized forward flow yielded additional plaque fragments and when the efficiency of POFR was assessed with forward flushing volumes similar to those used for DF, the efficiencies were similar, although larger fragments were more efficiently removed with POFR.\nIn our model, both protection strategies were less than ideal. For POFR, high back pressures or multiple aspirations improve the efficiency of cerebral protection but additional fragments were released by pressurized flow even after aspiration of 150 mL of saline. DF devices create a pressure gradient and fragments apparently went around the device with pressurized flow in our PTFE lumen. Over-sizing of DF devices partially corrected this problem and increased over all DF efficiency to be comparable to POFR for smaller fragments but not for larger fragments.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery stent placement is a recognized treatment for patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis when medical therapy fails. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) is the primary method used for noninvasive assessment of renal artery patency. Arterial stents alter the compliance of the artery, which could make the standard reference values, based on native renal artery velocities, inaccurate. This study attempted to determine DUS criteria for renal artery in-stent restenosis (ISR).\nWe studied 67 consecutive patients with suspected renal artery ISR based on abnormal renal DUS results, defined as peak systolic velocity (PSV) >or=200 cm/s and renal/aortic velocity ratio (RAR) >or=3.5. The ISR patients were compared with 55 consecutive nonstented patients who underwent renal DUS evaluation and renal angiography. Those with >or=50% angiographic narrowing in each group were analyzed, and renal PSV and RAR were compared.\nIn the 67 patients with renal stents and 55 patients without renal stents, a statistically significant correlation was found for both PSV and RAR in detecting renal ISR and renal artery stenosis as defined by quantitative angiography (P = .02). For any level of angiographic stenosis >or=50%, the ISR group had relatively higher PSV and RAR compared with the nonstented group. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that PSV >or=395 cm/s or RAR >or=5.1 were the most predictive of angiographically significant ISR >or=70%.\nThe current DUS criteria for native renal arteries may overestimate the degree of angiographic ISR due to changes in compliance. We recommend that DUS laboratories make adjustments in PSV and RAR obtained by DUS when monitoring the patency of renal stents for ISR.",

In most patients, the need for distal exposure can be anticipated in advance, thereby enabling the surgeon to consider simple measures, such as nasolaryngeal intubation, or more complex interventions, such as temporomandibular subluxation, to facilitate access. Once the procedure is underway, however, neither of these strategies can be used. The advantage of the approach described in this article is that it can be used at any time during the operation.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that silent embolic infarcts on computed tomography (CT) brain scans can predict ipsilateral neurologic hemispheric events and stroke in patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis.\nIn a prospective multicenter natural history study, 821 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis graded with duplex scanning who had CT brain scans were monitored every 6 months for a maximum of 8 years. Duplex scans were reported centrally, and stenosis was expressed as a percentage in relation to the normal distal internal carotid criteria used by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists. CT brain scans were reported centrally by a neuroradiologist. In 146 patients (17.8%), 8 large cortical, 15 small cortical, 72 discrete subcortical, and 51 basal ganglia ipsilateral infarcts were present; these were considered likely to be embolic and were classified as such. Other infarct types, lacunes (n = 15), watershed (n = 9), and the presence of diffuse white matter changes (n = 95) were not considered to be embolic.\nDuring a mean follow-up of 44.6 months (range, 6 months-8 years), 102 ipsilateral hemispheric neurologic events (amaurosis fugax in 16, 38 transient ischemic attacks [TIAs], and 47 strokes) occurred, 138 patients died, and 24 were lost to follow-up. In 462 patients with 60% to 99% stenosis, the cumulative event-free rate at 8 years was 0.81 (2.4% annual event rate) when embolic infarcts were absent and 0.63 (4.6% annual event rate) when present (log-rank P = .032). In 359 patients with <60% stenosis, embolic infarcts were not associated with increased risk (log-rank P = .65). In patients with 60% to 99% stenosis, the cumulative stroke-free rate was 0.92 (1.0% annual stroke rate) when embolic infarcts were absent and 0.71 (3.6% annual stroke rate) when present (log-rank P = .002). In the subgroup of 216 with moderate 60% to 79% stenosis, the cumulative TIA or stroke-free rate in the absence and presence of embolic infarcts was 0.90 (1.3% annual rate) and 0.65 (4.4% annual rate), respectively (log-rank P = .005).\nThe presence of silent embolic infarcts can identify a high-risk group for ipsilateral hemispheric neurologic events and stroke and may prove useful in the management of patients with moderate asymptomatic carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Platelet function exhibits circadian variation with highest levels of activity in the morning and plays a central role in arterial thrombotic events, including thrombotic stroke following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Prior to the platelet-rich thrombus occluding the carotid artery, multiple embolic signals are detected in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. We hypothesized that patients undergoing CEA early in the day may be at an increased stroke risk and this would manifest as an increased postoperative embolic count.\nData were collected prospectively on 235 patients undergoing primary CEA. Accurate start and finish times were recorded in addition to the number of postoperative emboli detected in the first three hours after CEA using transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring.\nFor operations finishing before midday, there was a 3.6-fold increase in the number of emboli detected relative to afternoon finishes (53.2 vs 14.8, P = .002) with similar results for starts before 10:30 AM (48.1 vs 14.7, P =.002). There was also a significant correlation between start time and emboli count (P = .02). Of the 55 patients with no postoperative emboli, only 19 had a morning start (relative risk 0.63, P = .011). Patients were 6.9 times more likely to require treatment with Dextran-40 to prevent progression onto a thrombotic stroke if their CEA finished before midday (P = .008).\nThere is a significantly increased rate of postoperative embolization for operations begun earlier in the day. Carotid endarterectomies performed in the afternoon may be at less risk of developing postoperative thrombotic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Ulcer healing is a seldom reported outcome in studies of critical leg ischemia (CLI). The aim of this study was to analyze local factors affecting ulcer healing time after infrainguinal bypass surgery (IBS) for CLI Fontaine IV.\nIn this prospective single center cohort study, 110 patients (113 legs) undergoing IBS due to CLI with ischemic tissue defects during year 2006 were followed prospectively for 1 year after the bypass. Ulcer location, duration, presence of gangrene, and the University of Texas wound classification (UTWCS) were determined at presentation. Healing time of the ischemic tissue defects, leg salvage, patency, and survival were calculated. The characteristics of the ischemic tissue lesions and patient comorbidities were analyzed to determine risk factors for adverse outcome.\nComplete ulcer healing (+/-SE) was achieved in 74% +/- 5% of the legs 12 months after IBS. Median ulcer healing time was 186 days (range, 11 to >365 days). Leg salvage, secondary patency, and survival at 12 months were 87% +/- 3%, 82% +/- 4%, and 76% +/- 5%, respectively. Amputation-free survival with healed ulcers was attained in 55% at 12 months. Ischemic tissue lesions located in the mid- and hindfoot had significantly prolonged ulcer healing time (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1 to 0.9, P = .044). None of the UTWCS classes predicted either ulcer healing time or leg salvage. Median ulcer duration before IBS was 68 days, range, 6 to 1154 days. Ulcer duration did not correlate with ulcer healing time (Spearman r = 0.138, P = .267). Ischemic ulcers with gangrene were not associated with prolonged ulcer healing time (P = .353).\nThe location of the ischemic tissue lesions influences ulcer healing time. According to our study UTWCS can be used as descriptive classification of ischemic ulcers but it does not predict the ulcer healing time or leg salvage after infrainguinal bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events. The metabolic syndrome is a frequent condition among patients with manifest vascular disease, but the influence of the metabolic syndrome on cardiovascular events in patients with PAOD is unknown. Also, progression and regression of the metabolic syndrome after follow-up are not extensively studied.\nThe study population consisted of 461 patients with symptomatic PAOD from the Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease study (SMART). Patients underwent vascular screening at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 5.5 +/- 1.3 years. Hazard ratios (HRs) for vascular events according to metabolic syndrome status (updated National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] criteria) were calculated using Cox regression analysis. The course of the metabolic syndrome during follow-up and the influence of body mass index (BMI) on development or disappearance of the syndrome were assessed.\nDuring follow-up, 91 first vascular events were recorded. Cumulative 3-year survival free from vascular events was 84.7% in metabolic syndrome patients compared to 92.1% in participants without the syndrome. The metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of vascular events (HR 1.51; 1.01-2.30, age- and gender-adjusted). During follow-up, 128 patients died or were lost to follow-up, and of 333 remaining patients, 221 participated in follow-up measurements. The metabolic syndrome disappeared in 16% of patients and was incident in 14% of patients during follow-up. Waist circumference increased with 10 +/- 8 cm in those developing the syndrome. A BMI decrease of 1 kg/m(2) significantly decreased the risk of metabolic syndrome development by 23% (odds ratio [OR] 0.77; 0.62-0.96), and increased the chance to revert to a non-metabolic syndrome state by 32% (OR 1.32; 1.03-1.71).\nThe metabolic syndrome is associated with a 1.5-fold increase in risk of vascular events in PAOD patients. Weight control reduces metabolic syndrome incidence and increases metabolic syndrome resolution during follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Owing to its structural and anatomic characteristics, imaging of the lymphatic system has been difficult. The conventional diagnostic method of radionuclide-based imaging has the disadvantage of poor resolution. Recent work has shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can depict lymphatic channels in patients with lymphedema. This study evaluated the anatomic and functional images of contrast MR lymphangiography in the diagnosis of limb lymphatic circulation disorders.\nThe study enrolled 27 patients with primary lymphedema. Four patients had bilateral disease, and 23 had unilateral disease. Contrast-enhanced lymphangiography was performed with a 3.0-T MR unit after the intracutaneous injection of gadobenate dimeglumine into the interdigital webs of the dorsal foot. The kinetics of enhanced lymph flow within the lymphatic system were calculated using the formula [speed in cm = total length of visualized lymph vessel in cm/inspection time in minutes] and by comparing dynamic nodal enhancement and time-signal intensity curves between edematous and contralateral limbs. Morphologic abnormalities of the lymphatic system were also evaluated.\nExamination of the MRIs after injection of the contrast agent showed enhanced lymphatic channels consistently visualized in all clinical lymphedematous limbs and in five contralateral limbs of unilateral lymphedema patients. The speed of flow within the lymphatics of lymphedematous limbs was 0.3 to 1.48 cm/min. Contrast enhancement in inguinal nodes of edematous limbs was significantly less than that of contralateral limbs (P < .01). Dynamic measurement of contrast enhancement showed a remarkable lowering of peak time (P < .01) and peak enhancement (P < .01), and a delay in outflow in inguinal nodes of affected limbs compared with that of control limbs. Postcontrast MRI also depicted varied distribution patterns of lymphatics and abnormal lymph flow pathways within lymph nodes in the limbs with lymphatic circulation disorders.\nContrast MR lymphangiography with gadobenate dimeglumine is capable of visualizing the precise anatomy of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes in lymphedematous limbs. It also provides information concerning the functional status of lymph flow transport in the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes of these limbs.",

    "abstract": "Open vascular surgical procedures have decreased since the advent of endovascular repair. Advances in spinal fusion techniques and artificial disc replacement have led to an increase in the need for anterior retroperitoneal exposure of the lumbar spine (ARES). Vascular surgeons participate as \"exposure surgeons\" for these cases due to their unique skills in dealing with retroperitoneal structures. We report a single center experience with this procedure and focus on injury pattern and preservation of open surgical training.\nPatients undergoing ARES over an 8-year period were identified from our vascular registry. A two-team approach involving a vascular surgeon and spine surgeon has been routinely employed. ARES was performed for anterior lumbar interbody fusion or total disc replacement. The intraoperative techniques of vascular manipulation were reviewed. The need for suture repair of vascular structures and the incidence and timing of serious vascular injury was recorded.\nFour-hundred and five ARES procedures were performed. The levels exposed included L5-S1 alone (128), L4-5 (54), 4-5 and 5-S1 (139), and other combinations in 84 cases. The exposure involved the L4-5 disc in 243 cases (60%). Exposure of L4-5 was accomplished above the left common iliac artery (CIA) in 44%, between the left CIA and common iliac vein (CIV) in 45%, and below the left CIV in 11%. Minor vascular injuries (all venous) needing suture repair occurred in 24% of cases overall. Minor vascular injuries occurred during both exposure (43%) and instrumentation (57%). Minor vascular injuries were significantly more frequent in cases involving the L4-5 disc than in those not involving L4-5 (31.7% vs 11.1%, P < .001). Serious, life-threatening, vascular injuries occurred in 12 patients (3%), all during instrumentation, and included left CIV laceration (seven cases), right CIV laceration (two cases), and inferior vena cava laceration, distal aortic plaque disruption and left CIA laceration in one case each. There was no association between body mass index, prior surgery, or type of instrumentation and the occurrence of minor or major vascular injuries. Postoperative vascular complications included three deep vein thromboses; two of which occurred in patients with CIV laceration.\nVascular expertise is important in anterior retroperitoneal lumbar spine exposure. Minor venous injuries frequently occur during exposure and instrumentation. Significant vascular injuries, while rare, occur during instrumentation, therefore the vascular surgeon should remain present throughout the entire procedure. The vascular manipulations required during exposure of the L4-5 disc offer an excellent opportunity for open vascular surgical experience. Vascular surgeon involvement in these cases allows for prompt repair of vascular injuries and provides opportunities for the vascular surgery resident to augment his/her open surgical training.",

Significant vascular injuries, while rare, occur during instrumentation, therefore the vascular surgeon should remain present throughout the entire procedure. The vascular manipulations required during exposure of the L4-5 disc offer an excellent opportunity for open vascular surgical experience. Vascular surgeon involvement in these cases allows for prompt repair of vascular injuries and provides opportunities for the vascular surgery resident to augment his/her open surgical training.",

The exposure involved the L4-5 disc in 243 cases (60%). Exposure of L4-5 was accomplished above the left common iliac artery (CIA) in 44%, between the left CIA and common iliac vein (CIV) in 45%, and below the left CIV in 11%. Minor vascular injuries (all venous) needing suture repair occurred in 24% of cases overall. Minor vascular injuries occurred during both exposure (43%) and instrumentation (57%). Minor vascular injuries were significantly more frequent in cases involving the L4-5 disc than in those not involving L4-5 (31.7% vs 11.1%, P < .001). Serious, life-threatening, vascular injuries occurred in 12 patients (3%), all during instrumentation, and included left CIV laceration (seven cases), right CIV laceration (two cases), and inferior vena cava laceration, distal aortic plaque disruption and left CIA laceration in one case each. There was no association between body mass index, prior surgery, or type of instrumentation and the occurrence of minor or major vascular injuries. Postoperative vascular complications included three deep vein thromboses; two of which occurred in patients with CIV laceration.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest an increased risk of neurologic complications after coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). The preventative role of preoperative revascularization of the LSA using carotid-subclavian bypass or transposition remains controversial. We assessed this increased risk and the role of revascularization by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.\nIn the absence of any randomized controlled trials, the Pubmed and Embase databases were searched to identify all series reporting TEVAR without LSA coverage compared with LSA coverage with and without revascularization. The incidence of neurologic complications, namely cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and spinal cord ischemia (SCI), were recorded for each group. Pooled odds ratios (POR) were then calculated for postoperative CVA and SCI.\nCompared with patients without LSA coverage, the risk of CVA was increased both in patients with LSA coverage alone (4.7% vs 2.7%; POR, 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.09; P = .005) and in those with LSA coverage after revascularization (4.1% vs 2.6%; POR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.17-8.65; P = .02). The risk of SCI was also increased in patients requiring LSA coverage (2.8% vs 2.3%; POR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.30-4.39; P = .005) but not for LSA coverage after revascularization (0.8% vs 2.7%; POR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.56-5.15; P = .35).\nThe risk of neurologic complications is increased after coverage of the LSA during TEVAR. Preemptive revascularization offers no protection against CVA, perhaps indicating a heterogeneous etiology. Revascularization may reduce the risk of SCI, although limited data tempers this conclusion. Improved or perhaps compulsory reporting to registries of a minimum data set may help further assess the exact etiology of these complications and identify a higher-risk subset of patients in whom revascularization might prove protective.",

    "abstract": "Compared with angiogenesis, arteriogenesis is a distinct process based on the remodeling and maturation of pre-existing arterioles into large conductance arteries. Therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed as a potential treatment for ischemic atherosclerotic diseases. Since a variety of angiogenic factors have been tested with inconsistent so far clinical results, the challenge remains in identifying the factor(s) that will stimulate functional neovascularization. Thrombin has been reported to play a pivotal role in the initiation of angiogenesis by regulating and organizing a network of angiogenic mediators. Also, it was recently demonstrated that thrombin is a potent anti-apoptotic factor for endothelial cells, providing evidence on a potential role of thrombin in vascular protection and maintenance of vessel integrity. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that thrombin may promote the development of mature functional blood vessels.\nSeventy-four (n=74) rabbits underwent bilateral femoral artery surgical excision. On the 20th postsurgical day increasing doses of VEGF or bFGF or thrombin were injected in one ischemic limb per rabbit and an equal volume of normal saline to the contralateral control limbs. Quantification of newly developed collateral vessels (diameter >500 mum) was performed by transauricular intra-arterial subtraction angiography. Computerized quantitative analysis of collateral vessels in angiography images was based on the concept of multiscale structural tensor. Perfusion analysis of an in vivo dynamic computed tomography study was performed to investigate hemodynamic recovery of the distal ischemic limbs. Tissue perfusion analysis was performed with the semiquantitative slope methodology, which focuses on the first-pass arterial phase.\nA single administration of thrombin exhibited a dose-dependent increase of arteriogenic outcome. Thrombin at 5000 IU induced a 30.2 +/- 7.4% (P < 0.05) increase of total collateral area and length. Both VEGF and bFGF were without any significant effect at the concentrations used. Functional estimation of limb perfusion showed a statistically significant increase of blood flow recovery only for thrombin. The semiquantitative slope method perfusion score differed significantly in the 5000 IU thrombin treated limbs (5.7 +/- 0.3 vs 5.0 +/- 0.3 in control ischemic limbs; P < .05), and was not significantly inferior from the score of normal nonoperated limbs (6.5 +/- 0.3) suggesting a trend towards hemodynamic recovery of distal limb perfusion.\nIn a rabbit hindlimb ischemia model, thrombin promoted the formation of large collateral vessels and improved the perfusion of distal ischemic tissue. These results provide new insights in understanding the involvement of thrombin in vascular formation and point to a novel role of thrombin in arteriogenesis.",

The semiquantitative slope method perfusion score differed significantly in the 5000 IU thrombin treated limbs (5.7 +/- 0.3 vs 5.0 +/- 0.3 in control ischemic limbs; P < .05), and was not significantly inferior from the score of normal nonoperated limbs (6.5 +/- 0.3) suggesting a trend towards hemodynamic recovery of distal limb perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Claudication is the most common presentation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), producing significant ambulatory compromise. Claudicating patients, most of whom are elderly, have reduced mobility and poor health outcomes, including an increased risk of falls. The gait of elderly fallers is characterized by increased variability. Increase in the variability of the locomotor system makes the gait more noisy and unstable. The purpose of this study is to investigate gait variability in patients with PAD.\nNineteen symptomatic PAD patients (age, 63.6 +/- 9.8 years; body mass, 82.1 +/- 18.5 kg; height, 1.71 +/- 0.06 m) walked on a treadmill in the absence of pain or claudication symptoms while joint flexion and extension kinematics were captured. Results were compared with results obtained from 17 matched healthy controls (age, 65.2 +/- 12.5 years; body mass, 82.0 +/- 25.9.5 kg; height, 1.73 +/- 0.08 m). Relative joint angles were calculated for the ankle, knee, and hip flexion/extension, and the stride-to-stride variability of joint flexion and extension was calculated from at least 30 consecutive footfalls. Variability was expressed using the largest Lyapunov exponent, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. Independent t tests were used to compare gait variability between groups.\nSymptomatic PAD patients had significantly higher largest Lyapunov exponent values and coefficient of variation values for all joints, and higher standard deviation values at the ankle and the hip (P < .05).\nSymptomatic PAD patients have increased gait variability at the ankle, knee, and hip joints at baseline ambulation in the absence of claudication pain. Our findings indicate significant baseline deterioration in the locomotor system of symptomatic PAD patients. This deterioration results in increased noise and instability of gait and is a potential contributing factor to the falls and mobility problems experienced by symptomatic PAD patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy for symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is common but is associated with a significant restenosis rate. This study evaluates the outcomes of percutaneous endoluminal therapy for symptomatic restenosis (>50% on angiography) after renal intervention.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent endovascular intervention for ARAS and were followed by duplex ultrasound scan between January 1990 and January 2008. Clinical benefit defined as freedom from recurrent hypertension or renal-related morbidity (increase in persistent creatinine >20% of baseline, progression to hemodialysis, death from renal-related causes), anatomic patency, restenosis, and patient survival were measured.\nA total of 447 patients underwent 619 renal artery interventions. A total of 80 vessels restenosed with an actuarial restenosis rate of 19% at 5 years. Of these restenoses, 65 (81%) were associated with recurrent symptoms (recurrent hypertension 84%, or continuing deterioration in renal function 16%). Fifty-five (85%) underwent repeat angioplasty and 10 underwent bypass surgery. The remainder was observed. The 55 percutaneous interventions were performed in 51 patients (61% female, average age 62 years, range, 51-85). A total of 73% had metabolic syndrome, 58% had hyperlipidemia, and 51% were considered diabetic; all of them had primary stenting during their first procedure. There was a 4% technical failure rate in both groups. In the restenosis group, the presence of stent was associated with a 9% technical failure rate, while in the absence of a stent the technical failure rate was only 3% (P < .05). At 5 years, outcomes were equivalent between the primary and recurrent groups for survival (76 +/- 2% vs 75 +/- 8%, primary vs recurrent), cumulative patency (82 +/- 3% vs 70 +/- 10%), freedom from restenosis (81 +/- 3% vs 81 +/- 9%), and retained clinical benefit (44 +/- 4% vs 46 +/- 10%). By Cox proportional hazards and multivariate analysis, administration of statins were associated with freedom from restenosis in the recurrent lesions. Statins, contralateral kidney size (>9 cm) and a >/=20% improvement in baseline creatinine with 3 months were associated with freedom from recurrent symptoms. Restenosis after therapy in recurrent lesions was significantly correlated with recurrent symptoms (Spearman r = 0.4614, P < .0004).\nPercutaneous reintervention for renal artery restenosis is safe and effective with equivalent outcomes to primary intervention. The patients are more likely to present with recurrent hypertension and be younger and of female gender than patients presenting for primary intervention. Functional outcomes after reintervention are equivalent to primary intervention.",

    "abstract": "In different regions of the United States, highly variable rates have been documented for a wide range of procedures, such as prostatectomy and caesarean section. It is generally held that this variation is due to inconsistent physician practice patterns or other nonmedical considerations. Only limited research has been conducted regarding vascular surgical operations. We examined national data on the utilization of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to determine the extent and diversity of regional variations.\nMedicare discharge data quantified the per capita rate of CEA in 50 states and the District of Columbia in 2003. Multiple metrics pertaining to risk factors, socioeconomic status, access to care, provider density, and local health care capacity were quantified. We performed bivariate analysis, Pearson (PC) or Spearman (SC) correlations, and multiple regression modeling.\nIn 2003, 83,164 CEAs were performed on 28,767,985 enrollees. CEA rates were 28.9 +/- 7.8 per 10,000 (range, 5.6-44.7 per 10,000). The rate of CEA was highly correlated with the number of heart disease deaths (PC = 0.575, P < .0001), deaths by stroke (PC = 0.504, P = .0002), and percentage of adult smokers in a state (PC = 0.643, P < .0001). These three factors held the strongest association with variation in CEA rates. Statistically, they explained 51% of the variation in total number of CEAs (R(2) = 0.5074, P < .0001). Median annual income (PC = -0.608, P < .0001) and percentage of college degrees (PC = -0.606, P < .0001) displayed inverse relationships to CEA rates. Per capita hospital beds (SC = 0.540, P < .0001) and rural health care clinics (SC = 0.518, P < .0001) exhibited positive correlations. The number of physicians or vascular surgeons did not predict higher utilization of CEA.\nThe strongest correlations for CEA were three markers associated with atherosclerotic disease: percentage of adult smokers and deaths from heart disease or stroke. Geographic variation in this vascular procedure is chiefly associated with variance in markers of disease prevalence, not physician preference or other nonmedical factors. The increased utilization of carotid stenting, accompanied by the participation of a much wider range of medical specialists, may affect this relationship in the future.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the relationship between immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 and idiopathic sclerosing lesions has attracted much attention. IgG4-related disease was first described with regard to the pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis), and has been expanded to various organ systems. We previously reported that inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA) could be one of the manifestations of IgG4-related disease. In this study, we tried to elucidate the clinical characteristics of IgG4-related IAAA.\nThis study consisted of 23 cases of IAAA and 40 cases of atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and pathological features were examined. Aneurysms of 13 cases histologically corresponded to IgG4-related IAAA.\nThose cases accounted for 5% of all surgical AAAs, and 57% of IAAAs. Compared to non-IgG4-related IAAA, IgG4-related cases were characterized by less frequent association with abdominal or back pain. Serum IgG4 concentrations were significantly elevated in IgG4-related cases. Interestingly, patients with IgG4-related IAAA frequently showed an allergic constitution, such as drug allergy, autoimmune diseases, high serum IgE concentrations, and a high titer of antinuclear antibody. Pathologically, IgG4-related cases were characterized by more significant thickening of the adventitia and more numerous IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrations. Three non-IgG4-related cases showed aneurysmal rupture at the time of first presentation, whereas no IgG4-related cases showed rupture.\nRecognizing a new disease entity of IgG4-related IAAA seems important because this was clinically and pathologically different from conventional aAAA and non-IgG4-related IAAA.",

    "abstract": "Cilostazol improves walking distance and quality of life in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study assessed the vascular and biochemical effects of cilostazol therapy in PAD patients.\nPAD patients were prospectively recruited to a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Baseline clinical data were recorded. Clinical assessment included measurement of arterial compliance, transcutaneous oxygenation, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and treadmill walking distance. Blood analyses included a full blood panel, coagulation screen, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lipid profiles. Quality of life indices were recorded using validated generic and walking-specific questionnaires. All tests were performed at baseline, 6, and 24 weeks.\nEighty patients (53 men) were recruited from December 2004 to January 2006. The cilostazol group had a significant reduction in the augmentation index compared with the placebo group at 6 weeks (19.7% vs 26.7%, P = .001) and at 24 weeks (19.7% vs 27.7%, P = .005). A paradoxic reduction in transcutaneous oxygenation levels was identified in the cilostazol group for the left foot at 6 weeks and for the right foot at both 6 and 24 weeks. The ABIs were not significantly different between treatment groups at baseline, 6 weeks, or 24 weeks for the left and right lower limbs. The mean percentage change in walking distance from baseline improved more markedly in the cilostazol compared with the placebo group for absolute claudication distance at 6 (78.6% vs 26.4%, P = .20) and 24 weeks (173.1% vs 92.1%, P = .27); however, these failed to reach significance. Significant improvements in lipid profiles were demonstrated with cilostazol therapy at 6 weeks (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and at 24 weeks (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein). The cilostazol treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in the Short Form-36 (physical functioning, physical component score), Walking Impairment (distance and speed), and Vascular Quality of Life (pain) indices at 6 and 24 weeks. Although cilostazol was associated with side effects in approximately one-third of patients, most settled within 6 weeks, facilitating the continuation of therapy in >89%.\nCilostazol is a well-tolerated, safe, and efficacious treatment for PAD patients. It not only improves patients' symptomatology and quality of life but also appears to have beneficial effects on arterial compliance, possibly through its lipid-lowering property.",

The mean percentage change in walking distance from baseline improved more markedly in the cilostazol compared with the placebo group for absolute claudication distance at 6 (78.6% vs 26.4%, P = .20) and 24 weeks (173.1% vs 92.1%, P = .27); however, these failed to reach significance. Significant improvements in lipid profiles were demonstrated with cilostazol therapy at 6 weeks (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and at 24 weeks (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein). The cilostazol treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in the Short Form-36 (physical functioning, physical component score), Walking Impairment (distance and speed), and Vascular Quality of Life (pain) indices at 6 and 24 weeks. Although cilostazol was associated with side effects in approximately one-third of patients, most settled within 6 weeks, facilitating the continuation of therapy in >89%.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy for symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is considered effective. This study evaluates the factors that impact long term anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular therapy of ARAS in patients with a solitary functioning kidney.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent endovascular intervention for ARAS and identified patients with a solitary functioning kidney (absent or nonfunctioning contralateral kidney) and patients with contralateral normal kidney (for comparison) between January 1990 and January 2008. Indications for intervention in the solitary functioning kidney were poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [BP] >90 mm Hg on >3 antihypertensive medications) and/or elevated creatinine (Cr >/=1.5 mg/dL). Clinical benefit was defined as freedom from composite recurrent symptoms (recurrent hypertension or renal-related morbidity-increase in persistent creatinine >20% of baseline, progression to hemodialysis, and death from renal-related causes), anatomic patency and patient survival were measured.\nA total of 242 patients (56% male, average age 69 years, range, 45-90) underwent angioplasty (23%) or primary stenting (77%) of a single renal artery with a normal contralateral renal vessel and kidney and 73 patients (58% male, average age 70 years, range, 52-89) underwent angioplasty (37%) or primary stenting (63%) for a solitary functioning kidney. There were no significant differences in mortality or morbidity between the groups. There was a significant difference in the long-term survival with 55 +/- 8% patients with a normal contralateral kidney vs 27 +/- 7% patients with a solitary functioning kidney alive at 10 years. Clinical benefit was 67 +/- 6% and 67 +/- 4% at 5 years and 63 +/- 8% and 62 +/- 4% at 10 years for solitary functioning kidney and normal contralateral groups, respectively. Using proportional hazard analysis, the predictors of long-term clinical benefit were ipsilateral kidney size (>9 cm), no immediate deterioration in function, and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) >30 mL/min/1.73m(2). Neither control of diabetes nor the administration of statins was shown to influence outcomes in the solitary functioning kidney.\nIntervention in patients with a solitary functioning kidney is a safe procedure and improves or stabilizes renal function in 82% of patients. Clinical benefit is dictated by preoperative GFR, renal size, and the occurrence of acute functional injury after the procedure.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular procedure volume has increased rapidly, and endovascular procedures have become the initial treatment option for many vascular diseases. Consequently, training in endovascular procedures has become an essential component of vascular surgery training. We hypothesized that, due to this paradigm shift, open surgical case volume may have declined, thereby jeopardizing training and technical skill acquisition in open procedures.\nVascular surgery trainees are required to log both open and endovascular procedures with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). We analyzed the ACGME database (2001-2007), which records all cases (by Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code) performed by graduating vascular trainees. Case volume was evaluated according to the mean number of cases performed per graduating trainee.\nThe mean number of total major vascular procedures performed per trainee increased by 174% between 2001 and 2007 (from 298.3 to 519.2). Endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic procedures increased by 422% (from 63.7 to 269.1) and accounted for 93.0% of the increase in total procedures. The number of open aortic procedures (aneurysm, occlusive, mesenteric, renal) decreased by 17.1% (from 49.7 to 41.2), while the number of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair procedures increased by 298.8% (from 16.9 to 50.5). Specifically, open aortic aneurysm procedures decreased by 21.8%, aortobifemoral bypass increased by 3.2%, and open mesenteric or renal procedures decreased by 13%. Infrainguinal bypass procedures remained relatively constant (from 37.6 to 36.5, 2.9% decrease), and the number of carotid endarterectomy procedures performed did not change significantly (from 43.6 to 42.2, 3.2% decrease).\nVascular surgery trainees are performing a vastly increased total number of procedures. This increase in total procedure volume is almost entirely attributable to the recent increase in endovascular procedures. Aside from a small decline in open aortic procedures, the volume of open surgical procedures has largely remained stable. It is essential that vascular surgery training programs continue to focus on both endovascular and open surgical skills in order for vascular surgeons to remain the premier specialists to care for patients with vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The United States population with vascular disease has changed dramatically during the past 2 decades, with large increases in the proportion of Hispanic, African American, and other minority patients. Not only has the number of these patients increased, but the types and distribution of vascular disease in minority populations is also different from that encountered in non-Hispanic whites. Although genetic makeup accounts for some of these differences, access to vascular care is also an important determinant, with many minority patients presenting late in the course of the disease process. These factors create significant challenges for the vascular specialists caring for these patients. The vascular surgery workforce is composed of >90% white men and does not currently represent the changes in the population of patients with vascular disease. In addition, women with vascular disease comprise up to 50% of many vascular surgery practices. In many parts of the country, Hispanics and African Americans outnumber non-Hispanic whites with vascular disease. Yet, women and minority physicians are still significantly under-represented in the field of vascular surgery. This year's E. Stanley Crawford Critical Issues Forum at the Society for Vascular Surgery meeting addressed the disconnect between the vascular surgery workforce and the patients whom we serve. This article reviews the projected demographic changes in the population of the United States, which supports the need for training a vascular surgery workforce that is more diverse. This article also reviews the current status of minority and female representation in medical schools, surgical training programs, and vascular surgery programs in the United States.",

    "abstract": "A 61-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 (Recklinghausen's disease) was referred for massive swelling of the right forearm, pain, increasing numbness, and impaired movement of the fingers. Angiography demonstrated a 13- x 11-mm aneurysm and a capped rupture of the ulnar artery. Because of the complicated soft-tissue condition, interventional treatment was indicated. Two 360 degrees coils were placed for embolization of the ruptured aneurysm. Arterial involvement in neurofibromatosis is a well known but infrequent occurrence. Stenotic lesions predominate. Aneurysmal defects are less common, and rupture of peripheral arteries is exceptional.",

The patient underwent successful surgical treatment by using an interposition tube graft (Dacron graft, 18 mm) with replantation of the MMA. Reports about a MMA arising separately from the aorta are extremely rare, especially in combination with an infrarenal aortic aneurysm. In our case, it arose from the anterior aspect of the abdominal aorta, 6 cm below the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and 1.2 cm above the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The MMA gave branches to the ileum and distal jejunum and supplied the iliocolic and middle colic artery branch as well as the left colic artery branch. It is of extreme clinical importance for the surgical procedure to have a detailed knowledge of the different anatomical variations and anomalies.",

    "abstract": "To assess for the first time the morphology of the lymphatic system in patients with posttraumatic edema of the lower extremities by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using the interstitial lymphangiography technique\nSix patients with posttraumatic edema in eight of their 12 lower extremities were examined by MR lymphangiography. Eighteen mL of gadoteridol and one mL of mepivacainhydrochloride 1% were subdivided into 10 portions and injected intracutaneously. MR imaging was performed with a 1.5-T system equipped with high-performance gradients. For MR lymphangiography, a 3D-spoiled gradient-echo sequence was used.\nIn five of the eight (63%) traumatized lower extremities, enlarged lymphatic vessels were detected, with the largest diameter measuring 5 mm. Additionally, a fast lymphatic outflow was observed in seven of the eight (88%) traumatized legs with enhancement of the inguinal lymph nodes already in the first image acquisition 15 minutes after contrast material injection. In two of the eight (25%) traumatized lower extremities, an extensive network of collateral lymphatic vessels was detected at the level of the calf. In both extremities, lymphatic collateralization involved not only the epifascial but also the subfascial lymphatic system. In one patient, who sustained a trauma of the left lower leg with tibial fracture, a small aneurysmatic widening of 7 mm could be detected at the middle level of the calf.\nMR lymphangiography is a safe and accurate minimal-invasive imaging modality for the evaluation of the lymphatic circulation in patients with posttraumatic edema of the lower extremities. If the extent of lymphatic damage is unclear at the initial clinical examination or requires a better definition for optimal therapeutic planning, MR lymphangiography is able to identify the anatomic and physiological derangements and to establish an objective baseline.",

    "abstract": "Two phase II clinical studies used an experimental, multi-chambered compression device with different cuff pressure combinations in subjects with leg edema and chronic venous insufficiency. The objective of each study was to evaluate the safety and the relative effects of different cuff pressure combinations to determine if edema reduction was dose-dependent.\nEach study enrolled adults with chronic (>or=6 weeks) venous edema corresponding to CEAP C(3)-C(5). The test device could apply different pressures at the foot, gaiter, mid-calf, and upper-calf. In the first study, the following six sustained pneumatic compression (SPC) profiles were applied for six hours each: 20, 30, and 40-mm Hg at the gaiter with graduated SPC (ie, lower pressures at the calf); and 20, 30, and 40-mm Hg at the gaiter with nongraduated SPC (ie, the same pressures at the calf). In the second study, the following three intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) profiles were applied for two hours each: 40, 50, and 60-mm Hg at the gaiter with graduated IPC (ie, lower pressures at the calf). Each study included a baseline profile with no compression and two-day intervals between profiles. Leg volume was measured before and after compression using the water-displacement method.\nA dose-response relationship was observed between increased SPC/IPC pressures and reduced limb edema. Limb volume was reduced most effectively with the highest pressures of 40-mm Hg nongraduated SPC and 60-mm Hg graduated IPC (136 mL and 87 mL, respectively); however, some subjects reported discomfort with these profiles. Limb volume was reduced by more than 100 mL with 30 to 40-mm Hg graduated SPC and by 69 mL with 50-mm Hg graduated IPC, and subjects rated these profiles as comfortable or very comfortable. Of the 28 study participants (12 SPC, 16 IPC), two subjects reported pain with 60-mm Hg IPC; no other adverse events were reported with SPC or IPC.\nPneumatic compression was safe and well-tolerated, with a dose-response relationship between increased SPC/IPC pressures and reduced leg edema. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a dose-relationship in compression therapy: higher pressures are associated with greater volume reduction in subjects with chronic venous edema.",

    "abstract": "Nutcracker syndrome, caused by compression of the left renal vein (LRV) between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta, results in left renal and gonadal venous hypertension. Several treatment options have been described to relieve associated symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate late results of LRV transposition and identify risk factors affecting outcomes.\nClinical data from 23 consecutive patients diagnosed with nutcracker syndrome from January 1996 to October 2007 were retrospectively reviewed.\nThere were 10 males and 13 females (median age 22 years; range, 14-67) with radiologic evidence of LRV compression. On ultrasound evaluation (15/23 patients), the mean ratio of LRV peak systolic velocity measured at the site of compression and the renal hilum was 7.3 (range, 2.5-12). On venography (14/23 patients), the mean renocaval pressure gradient was 4 mm Hg (range, 2-6 mm Hg). Twelve patients with atypical abdominal pain (n = 4), hematuria (n = 5), and varicocele (n = 6) were managed expectantly. Eleven patients underwent LRV transposition through a transperitoneal exposure. Symptoms in these patients included left flank pain (n = 10), hematuria (n = 7), and varicocele (n = 3). In 2/11 patients, the LRV was found to be occluded at operation. There were no early postoperative complications. Most conservatively managed patients remained stable or improved over a mean follow-up period of 26 months (range, 0.2-59 months). Two patients were lost to follow-up at our institution and ultimately underwent intervention with LRV stenting and autotransplantation elsewhere. One patient was diagnosed with thin basement membrane disease on renal biopsy. Five patients with varicocele remained asymptomatic; 1 underwent local repair. Over a mean follow-up of 39 months (range, 0.13-144 months) in surgically managed patients, symptoms of flank pain and hematuria resolved or improved in 8/10 and 7/7, respectively. Varicoceles recurred in 2/3 patients in spite of resolution of flank pain. Both preoperatively occluded LRVs rethrombosed; one underwent thrombolysis with stenting, the other reimplantation of the left gonadal vein into the IVC.\nEvaluation of the clinical significance of radiologic LRV compression remains challenging, as does selection of patients for intervention. LRV transposition is a safe, effective procedure in selected patients with persistent, severe symptoms. Patients with progression to occlusion of the LRV should be considered for alternative therapeutic procedures. Varicoceles, in the setting of nutcracker syndrome, may need independent repair.",

LRV transposition is a safe, effective procedure in selected patients with persistent, severe symptoms. Patients with progression to occlusion of the LRV should be considered for alternative therapeutic procedures. Varicoceles, in the setting of nutcracker syndrome, may need independent repair.",

    "results": "There were 10 males and 13 females (median age 22 years; range, 14-67) with radiologic evidence of LRV compression. On ultrasound evaluation (15/23 patients), the mean ratio of LRV peak systolic velocity measured at the site of compression and the renal hilum was 7.3 (range, 2.5-12). On venography (14/23 patients), the mean renocaval pressure gradient was 4 mm Hg (range, 2-6 mm Hg). Twelve patients with atypical abdominal pain (n = 4), hematuria (n = 5), and varicocele (n = 6) were managed expectantly. Eleven patients underwent LRV transposition through a transperitoneal exposure. Symptoms in these patients included left flank pain (n = 10), hematuria (n = 7), and varicocele (n = 3). In 2/11 patients, the LRV was found to be occluded at operation. There were no early postoperative complications. Most conservatively managed patients remained stable or improved over a mean follow-up period of 26 months (range, 0.2-59 months). Two patients were lost to follow-up at our institution and ultimately underwent intervention with LRV stenting and autotransplantation elsewhere. One patient was diagnosed with thin basement membrane disease on renal biopsy. Five patients with varicocele remained asymptomatic; 1 underwent local repair. Over a mean follow-up of 39 months (range, 0.13-144 months) in surgically managed patients, symptoms of flank pain and hematuria resolved or improved in 8/10 and 7/7, respectively. Varicoceles recurred in 2/3 patients in spite of resolution of flank pain. Both preoperatively occluded LRVs rethrombosed; one underwent thrombolysis with stenting, the other reimplantation of the left gonadal vein into the IVC.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is emerging as an acceptable treatment alternative to surgery for patients with carotid artery stenosis. The major risk of CAS is cerebral embolization of plaque and thrombus causing stroke or asymptomatic brain infarction. Use of embolic protection devices (EPD) to trap emboli before they reach the brain is now standard practice in CAS. The pore size of the currently available filters is >100 microns and emboli smaller than the EPD pores can still reach the brain. While the use of EPD is widespread, little evidence exists of their in vivo efficacy in preventing distal embolization. Our aim was to quantify the number of emboli reaching the brain with the device in place. Therefore, the expected value of this report is in its description of a novel application of transcranial Doppler (TCD). Due to the limited number of cases, it is not intended to support the use of one EPD over another.\nSix patients were monitored with ipsilateral simultaneous dual probe TCD during CAS. Two types of cerebral protection systems were evaluated: FilterWire EZ System (FW; Boston Scientific, Santa Clara, Calif) and GORE Neuro Protection System (NPS; W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz). By placing TCD probes both proximal and distal to the filterwire EPD, we quantified the microembolic signals before the EPD as well as those, which reached the intracranial circulation after the EPD. One probe was placed submandibularly to monitor the ICA (SICA), while another was placed transtemporally to monitor the middle and anterior cerebral artery (MCA + ACA). We compare the number of extracranial emboli prior to the EPD with the number of intracranial emboli after the EPD.\nDual probe monitoring was successful during the five stages of the CAS: lesion crossing (LC), predilatation (PreD), stent placement (SP), postdilatation (PostD), and filter/device removal (FR/DR). Using FW during LC by probe 1 (SICA)/probe 2 (MCA + ACA): (18 [range, 15-22]/15 [range, 11-20]), PreD (111 [range, 101-121]/101 [range, 90-111]), SP (68 [range, 60-76]/42 [range, 30-53]), PostD (27 [range, 25-30]/24 [range, 22-27]), FR (0.3 [range, 0-1]/0.7 [range, 0-1]) average number of microembolic signals were detected. Using NPS during LC (1.7 [range, 0-3]/1 [range, 0-2]), PreD (0/1.7 [range, 0-4]), SP (0/0), PostD (0/0), DR (18 [range, 0-18]/6.7 [range, 1-13]) average number of microembolic signals were detected.\nEPD significantly reduces but does not eliminate the number of microemboli reaching the brain during carotid artery angioplasty and stenting. We propose monitoring of CAS with submandibular and transtemporal TCD probes to further evaluate the practice of distal embolization protection. Although our study is not powered to make any recommendations about EPDs, we believe that sequential dual probe TCD monitoring is a worthy tool with the potential to give vital information to assess the various devices and the techniques of utilization.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the standard treatment of carotid stenosis for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS), however, has been proposed as alternative therapy for patients deemed at high-risk for CEA. This study examined 30-day adjudicated outcomes in a contemporary series of CEAs and assessed the validity of criteria used to define a potential high-risk patient population for CEA.\nPatients undergoing isolated CEA in private sector hospitals between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2006, were identified using the prospectively gathered National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. The primary study end points were 30-day stroke and death rates. Demographic, preoperative, and intraoperative variables were examined using multivariate models to identify variables associated with the study end points. Variables used to define systemic \"high-risk\" patients in the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) study (active cardiac disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and octogenarian status) were examined individually and in composite fashion for association with study endpoints.\nOf the 3949 CEAs performed, 59% were in men, 30% were \"high-risk\" (19% age >80), and 43% had a previous neurologic event. The 30-day stroke rate was 1.6%, the death rate was 0.7%, and combined stroke/death rate was 2.2%. Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative transfusion (odds ratio [OR], 5.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-20.66; P = .005), prior major stroke (OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 2.96-9.64; P < .0001), shorter height (surrogate for small artery size; OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.16; P = .010), and increased anesthesia time (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03; P = .008) were predictive of stroke. Critical limb ischemia (OR, 12.72; 95% CI, 3.49-46.40; P < .0001) and poor functional status (OR, 7.05; 95% CI, 2.95-16.82; P < .0001) were independent correlates of death. Systemic high-risk variables, either combined or individually, did not increase risk of stroke or death on multivariate analysis.\nCEA is associated with favorable 30-day outcomes across a spectrum of patient comorbidity features including octogenarian status. Anatomic and technical features are the important predictors of perioperative stroke, whereas critical limb ischemia and poor functional status are important predictors of death for patients undergoing CEA. These data refute the concept that CAS is preferred for patients deemed high-risk by virtue of systemic comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Historically, large randomized controlled studies looking at carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have indicated an increased perioperative risk for women when gender subgroup analysis was performed. However, the outcomes of carotid stenting in women as compared to men have not been adequately investigated. We sought to compare the safety and efficacy of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) when performed in women as compared to men.\nProcedures, complications, demographics, co-morbidities, and follow-up data from carotid stenting procedures performed in a bi-campus division were entered into a prospective database and then retrospectively supplemented with stored angiographic image data and reviewed. Arterial anatomic characteristics evaluated using angiographic images were: common carotid/internal carotid lesion length ratio, common carotid/internal carotid diameter, index lesion length, common carotid/internal carotid artery tortuosity, and lesion and aortic arch calcification. Outcomes compared included groin complications, postoperative pressor requirements, length of stay, restenosis, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, 228 patients underwent 238 procedures. Cerebral protection devices and self-expanding stents were placed in all patients. A total of 97 percutaneous interventions performed in 93 women were compared with 141 interventions in 135 men. Mean age in women was 71.8 +/- 9.2 years, in men was 72.2 +/- 9.1 years (P > .99); 44.3% of women and 34.7% of men had symptomatic disease (P = .14). Preoperative demographics and co-morbidities did not differ significantly between genders, with the exception of hypertension (83.0% of males vs 96.7% of females, P = .001), and history of coronary artery bypass grafting (31.8% of males vs 16.1% of females, P = .01). There were no significant differences seen in anatomic arterial characteristics, though there was a trend towards women having larger internal carotid to common carotid diameter ratios (0.65 vs 0.62) and more plaques isolated to the common carotid segment (9.5% vs 6.9%). There were no significant differences seen in overall 30-day peri-procedural stroke rate (2.1% in women and 4.2% in men, P = .48), death rate (0 % vs 0.7%, P > .99), or cardiac events (3.2% vs 0.7%, P = .3). The combined 30-day stroke, death, and MI rate was 5.7% for males compared to 5.4% for females (P > .99). There were no differences observed in the long-term survival, stroke-free survival, or restenosis between genders.\nDespite previous concerns over adverse outcomes in women undergoing carotid endarterectomy, from our data, carotid stenting appears to be a safe modality in women with equivalent outcomes when compared to men.",

The aim of this study was to determine the radiation exposure of patients undergoing EVAR and to assess the probability for the induction of both late and early radiation-related effects.\nDuring the period of May 2006 to December 2007 EVAR was carried out in 62 patients using a mobile C-arm unit. The following dosimetric quantities were assessed: fluoroscopy time, cumulative dose in air, dose-area product, field area, and peak skin dose.\nThe duration of fluoroscopy and the body mass index were found to be the main factors that influence the radiation burden in our hospital. The mean effective dose per procedure, 6.2 mSv, was between that from a planar coronary angiography and a coronary angioplasty. Taking into account the computed tomography (CT) procedure-related angiographies carried out during the first year, patients receive a total effective dose of about 62 mSv within the first year. In vivo dosimetry showed that the peak skin dose was linearly correlated with cumulative dose in air and did not exceed 1.0 Gy, ie, it was less than the threshold for any acute skin reaction.\nRepair of abdominal aortic aneurysm results in substantial radiation burden. Radiation-related risks for carcinogenesis and skin injuries are factors that have to be taken into account in the selection of the strategy of each facility.",

In vivo dosimetry showed that the peak skin dose was linearly correlated with cumulative dose in air and did not exceed 1.0 Gy, ie, it was less than the threshold for any acute skin reaction.",

    "abstract": "Based on a previous randomized study showing significantly superior patency rates for in vitro endothelialized expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts we investigated whether it was feasible for a nontertiary institution to offer autologous in vitro endothelialization to all elective infrainguinal bypass patients who had no suitable saphenous vein available.\nOver a period of 15 years, 310 out of 318 consecutive nonacute patients (age 64.7 +/- 8.6) received 341 endothelialized ePTFE grafts (308 femoropopliteal: 153 above knee [AK] and 155 below knee [BK] and 33 femorodistal). Autologous endothelial cells were harvested from short segments (3.9 +/- 1.1 cm) of subcutaneous veins (80% cephalic, 11% basilic, 2% external jugular, and 7% saphenous) and grown to mass cultures within 18.9 +/- 4.5 days before being confluently lined onto fibrin glue-coated ePTFE grafts. The graft diameter was 6 mm (64%) or 7 mm (36%). The overall procedure-related delay for graft implantation was 27.6 + 7.8 days. Growth failure prevented 2.5% of patients from receiving an endothelialized graft. The mean observation period was 9.6 years. Primary patencies were obtained from Kaplan-Meier survivorship functions. Explants for morphological analysis were obtained from eight patients.\nThe overall primary patency rate of femoropopliteal grafts was 69% at 5 years (68% [AK] vs 71% [BK]) and 61% at 10 years (59% [AK] vs 64% [BK]). Primary patency of 7 mm vs 6 mm grafts was 78%/62% at 5 years and 71%/55% at 10 years. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (log rank test P = .023; Breslow test P = .017). Stage I vs II/III patients showed 5-year patencies of 67% vs 73% (N.S.) and 10-year patencies of 61%% vs 53% (N.S.). The primary patency of femorodistal grafts was 52% at 5 years and 36% at 10 years. The limb salvage rate was 94% (fempop) vs 86% (femdistal) at 5 years and 89% vs 71% at 10 years. All retrieved samples showed the presence of an endothelium after 38.9 +/- 17.8 months.\nAutologous in vitro endothelialization was shown to be a feasible routine procedure at a nontertiary hospital. Explants confirmed the presence of an endothelium years after implantation while the primary patency in the particularly challenging subgroup of patients without a suitable saphenous vein resembles that of vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the impact of prior abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair on the risk of neurological deficit after thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) is lacking. The purpose of this study was to characterize the risk of TEVAR-related neurological deficit in patients who previously underwent infrarenal AAA surgery.\nProspective maintained databases of patients undergoing TEVAR in the participating institutions were searched for patients with a history of prior AAA surgery before TEVAR. Patient and procedural characteristics and postoperative mortality and morbidity were subsequently centrally collected and systematically entered in a database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed associating variables with postoperative spinal cord ischemia (SCI).\nSeventy-two patients were identified that underwent TEVAR after prior AAA repair. The risk of SCI was 12.5% (n = 9) and significantly higher than the 1.7% risk of SCI in patients without prior AAA repair (relative risk [RR] 7.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6 to 19.6, P < .0001). Symptoms of SCI completely resolved in 4 patients with prior AAA repair. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the following variables were significant predictors of SCI in patients with prior AAA repair: preoperative renal insufficiency (odds ratio [OR] 29.5; 95% CI 5.3-164, P < .001), increased length of aorta coverage by TEVAR (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2, P .039) and a lengthened time interval between prior AAA repair and TEVAR (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.4, P .026). Preoperative renal insufficiency was also significantly associated with the risk of SCI in multivariate analysis (P .011).\nPrior infrarenal AAA repair is associated with dramatic increased risk of SCI after TEVAR compared to patients without prior AAA surgery. Preoperative renal insufficiency appears to be an important predictor of SCI after TEVAR in patients with prior AAA repair. A thorough understanding of the risk profile in patients requiring TEVAR following prior AAA surgery is essential when determining appropriate surgical recommendations. If the diameter and rupture risk are large and TEVAR is indicated, the best available care should be offered for maximal protection of the spinal cord in these patients.",

    "abstract": "With the evolution of endovascular techniques, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Several studies have reported inferior results with CAS in the elderly. The objective of this study was to evaluate national outcomes of CAS and CEA and to compare utilization and outcomes of these procedures in different age groups.\nWe evaluated the 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample for hospitalizations with a procedure of CAS or CEA within 2 days after admission at age 60 years and above. Procedures were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and associated complications.\nA total of 80,498 carotid interventions (73,929 CEA and 6,569 CAS) were identified. The overall incidence of stroke was 4.16% after CAS and 2.66% after CEA (P < .0001). CAS was more often utilized in octogenarians than in younger patients (8.55% in 80+ vs 7.92% in 60-69 years; P < .0002). Increased age was not associated with greater stroke rates after CAS or CEA (P = .19 and .06, respectively). Octogenarians, compared to younger patients, had greater cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications after CEA (3.0% vs 1.9%, 1.9% vs 1.0%, and 1.4% vs 0.54%, respectively; P < .0001). When adjusted by age, gender, complications, and Elixhauser comorbidities, patients after CAS were 1.6 times as likely to have a stroke (confidence interval [CI] = 1.37-1.78) when compared to CEA. Significant predictors of postoperative hospital mortality were stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 29.0; 95% CI = 21.5-39.1), cardiac complications (OR = 6.4; 95% CI = 4.4-9.1), pulmonary complications (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.31-5.19), and renal failure (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.6-3.8). With increasing age, overall mortality steadily increased after CAS (from 0.23% to 0.67%; P = .0409) but remained stable after CEA.\nOctogenarians did not have a higher risk of stroke after CAS when compared to younger patients. Stroke was the strongest predictor of hospital mortality. The increased utilization of CAS in the aged, which had significantly higher stroke rates in all age groups studied, may account for the greater hospital mortality seen after CAS in the elderly. Further studies focused on the aged are needed to define the best management strategies in the elderly.",

Computerized image analysis was used to detect protein spots. Differentially expressed protein spots were in-gel digested and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Western blot analysis was used to confirm differential expression.\nSeven differentially expressed proteins were detected among 745 protein spots, selecting spots whose average relative volumes differed more than twofold between the nonruptured and the ruptured group. Four protein spots were up-regulated in the ruptured group, and three were down-regulated. Five of the spots were identified. Among the upregulated spots, No. 605 was identified as peroxiredoxin-2. The up-regulation was confirmed by Western blotting. No. 381 was identified as an actin fragment. Two spots, Nos. 719 and 499, could not be identified. Among the down-regulated protein spots, No. 130 contained two peptides; one reliably determined peptide, FEDGVLDPDYPR, is found in vitronectin. Another peptide, QIDNPDYK, was borderline significant and found in calreticulin. The down-regulation of vitronectin was confirmed by Western blotting. Spot Nos. 193 and 199 both contained peptides from albumin with actin also present in No. 199.\nThe identified proteins suggest that the aortic wall of ruptured aneurysms responds to a stressful condition and that proteolytic degradation of the cytoskeleton and connective tissue may be part of the response.",

Another peptide, QIDNPDYK, was borderline significant and found in calreticulin. The down-regulation of vitronectin was confirmed by Western blotting. Spot Nos. 193 and 199 both contained peptides from albumin with actin also present in No. 199.",

    "abstract": "Important recent data on retrievable inferior vena cava filter (R-IVCF) used in civilian trauma centers suffer from poor follow-up in these transient patients. Because US military casualties can be more easily followed globally, our objective was to further characterize R-IVCF outcomes in a trauma population with improved follow-up.\nFrom July 2003 to June 2007, trauma registry records were retrospectively reviewed for US soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan who had R-IVCF placement. Indications, type of filter, complications, outcomes, and retrieval data were analyzed.\nSeventy-two R-IVCFs were placed during the study period. Mean follow-up was 28.0 +/- 12.0 months, in 61 (85%) patients. Mean injury severity score (ISS) was 36.3 +/- 10.4 and mean patient age was 27.4 +/- 6.4 years. Fifty-nine R-IVCFs (82%) were not retrieved due to: death (1, 1.3%), technical failure (2, 2.8%), lost to follow-up (11, 15.2%), or contraindications to retrieval (45, 62.5%). Thirteen R-IVCFs were successfully removed, an overall retrieval rate of 18%. Median dwell time of those removed was 47 days (range, 10-94). IVCF indications were prophylactic in 23 (32%) and therapeutic in 49 (68%) cases. Both retrieval failures were due to incorporation into the caval wall, attempted at 90 and 156 days. Deep vein thromboses at the insertion site or pulmonary embolism following R-IVCF placement or removal were not observed. To date, there have been no reports of IVC stenosis or occlusion.\nR-IVCFs were safely and effectively used in severely injured military trauma patients with high ISS. Despite improved follow-up, overall retrieval remained low, reflecting the civilian experience. Indication, rather than follow-up losses, accounted for the low retrieval rate. Practice patterns for R-IVCF in trauma may need to be re-examined to optimize outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate feasibility, technical success, and the need for reintervention in the early perioperative period, following the introduction of intraoperative DynaCT (DynaCT, Siemens AG, Berlin, Germany) in patients undergoing infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). DynaCT involves the generation of computed tomography (CT)-like images from \"on table\" rotational angiographic acquisition.\nA prospectively maintained database of 312 patients undergoing EVAR (September 2001 - February 2007) was interrogated to determine incidence of early reintervention following satisfactory appearances of uniplanar completion angiography (control group). Following the introduction of DynaCT (DynaCT group - 80 patients), clinical and radiologic outcomes were prospectively evaluated (September 2007 - May 2008). Both groups underwent pre-discharge computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and color-flow duplex scan. Comparative analysis of procedural data, hospital-stay, mortality, and early reintervention between the two groups was undertaken.\nIn the control group, 14 (4.5%) patients required reintervention procedures within 30 days of EVAR (10 endovascular, 7 surgical). Six patients had type 1 endoleaks and 8 presented with acute limb ischemia. Review of this cohort suggested that the majority of complications (86%) may have been immediately identifiable with improved intra-operative quality control. In the DynaCT group, DynaCT was feasible in 81.3% (n = 65/80) of patients and resulted in the detection of five clinically significant anomalies (6.25%, n = 5/80). These technical problems were not identified at completion angiography but were corrected after DynaCT (2 type 1 endoleaks, 1 type 3 endoleak, 1 limb compression, and 1 graft thrombosis). Standard pre-discharge imaging did not identify any further graft-related complications in the DynaCT group. Introduction of DynaCT resulted in a reduced need for early reintervention (0/80 vs 14/312, P = .05).\nMost graft-related complications that mandate early reintervention following EVAR are due to remediable technical problems which are not identified by uniplanar completion angiography alone. DynaCT is a feasible intra-operative adjunct to completion angiography, which improves intra-operative quality control during endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

Select preoperative demographics, thoracoabdominal aortoiliac anatomy, intraoperative procedural variables, and postoperative outcomes were examined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed and odds ratio estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals.\nOf the 261 patients who underwent TEVAR, 27 developed SCI (10%).

Interestingly, while prior AAA repair (50/261, 19%) alone was not associated with SCI (P = .44), a history of either repaired or unrepaired AAA (101/261, 39%) was a predictor of SCI on multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 4.35 [1.43, 14.3], P = .10), independent of thoracic aortic coverage (P = .001) and lumbar artery patency (P = .008), both of which were also associated with SCI.\nAlthough the causes of SCI after TEVAR are multifactorial, abdominal aortic anatomy appears to be associated with development of this complication.

We report a new surgical approach to flow reduction by transposition of the radial artery to the elbow level.\nFrom 1992 to 2008, 47 consecutive patients (22 women) with brachial artery to elbow vein autogenous fistula underwent flow reduction via replacement of brachial artery by transposed distal radial artery inflow. Fistulas were side-to-end either brachial-cephalic (19) or brachial-basilic (28). The indications were hand ischemia (4), cardiac failure (13), concerns about future cardiac dysfunction (23), and chronic venous hypertension resulting in aneurysmal degeneration of the vein (7). Mean patient age was 44 years, 11% were diabetic, 17% were smokers, and mean BMI was 22. Mean fistula age before flow reduction was 2.5 years.\nTechnical success was 91% (43 of 47). The mean flow rate dropped by 66% +/- 14%. Clinical success in symptomatic patients was 75% (18 of 24). The fistula eventually had to be ligated in three cases of cardiac failure because of insufficient clinical improvement. All four patients with hand ischemia were cured, with no recurrence during follow-up. Primary patency rates at one and three years were 61% +/- 7% and 40% +/- 8%. Secondary patency rates at one and three years were 89% +/- 5% and 70% +/- 8%.\nTransposition of the radial artery, a safe and effective technique, might now be considered in the surgical armamentarium of flow reduction techniques.",

    "abstract": "Plaque instability is recognized as a multivessel phenomenon related to inflammation. This study examined if the morphology of femoral plaques was related to that of carotid plaques.\nThe echogenicity of femoral and carotid plaques of 102 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) was studied and classified as echolucent or echorich according to the gray-scale median (GSM) value, which was 53.6 for femoral plaques and 55.2 for carotid plaques. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and neutrophil count were also measured.\nEcholucent carotid plaques were more frequent in patients with echolucent than in those with echorich femoral plaques (55.8% vs 32.0%; P < .01). At multivariate analysis, femoral GSM lower than the median was the only significant predictor of echolucent carotid plaques (odds ratio [OR], 3.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-9.83). Patients with echolucent femoral plaques had higher serum CRP levels (P < .01) and a higher neutrophil count (P = .029) than patients with echorich femoral plaques. However, univariate analysis showed that neutrophil count (OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.23-9.85) but not hs-CRP was associated with echolucent carotid plaques. At multivariate analysis, neutrophil count exceeding the median remained associated with echolucent carotid plaques (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.37-23.85), whereas the association between femoral and carotid echolucency was attenuated (OR, 3.75; 95% CI, 0.98-4.43).\nIn PAD, the presence of echolucent femoral plaques is associated with a greater prevalence of echolucent carotid plaques, probably as a consequence of a more pronounced inflammatory profile. This confirms and extends the finding that plaque echolucency is a multivessel phenomenon. Prospective studies are needed to assess whether carotid screening in PAD patients might contribute to improving clinical decision-making.",

The primary aim of this study was to better establish the clinical validity of the PAQ by examining its association with functional indices related to PAD. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the clinical validity of this disease-specific measure is better as compared with the EuroQol-5-dimensional (EQ-5D), a standardized generic instrument.\nData on 711 consecutive PAD patients undergoing surgery were collected from 11 Dutch hospitals in 2004. At 3-year follow-up, questionnaires including the PAQ, EQ-5D, and EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) were completed in 84% of survivors. The PAQ was analyzed according to three domains, as established by a factor analyses in the Dutch population, and the summary score. Baseline clinical indices included the presence and severity of claudication intermittent (CI) and the Lee Cardiac Risk Index.\nAll three PAQ domains (Physical Function, Perceived Disability, and Treatment Satisfaction) were significantly associated with CI symptoms (P values < .001-.008). Patients with claudication had significant lower PAQ summary scores as compared with asymptomatic patients (58.6 +/- 27.8 vs 68.6 +/- 27.8, P = < .001). Furthermore, the PAQ summary score and the subscale scores for Physical Functioning and Perceived Disability demonstrated a clear dose-response relation for walking distance and the Lee Risk Index (P values < .001-.031). With respect to the generic EQ-5D, the summary EQ-5D index was associated with CI (0.81 +/- 0.20 vs 0.76 +/- 0.24, P = .031) but not with walking distance (P = .128) nor the Lee Risk Index (P = .154). The EQ VAS discriminated between the clinical indices (P values = .003-.008), although a clear dose-response relation was lacking.\nThe clinical validity of the PAQ proved to be good as the PAQ subscales discriminated well between patients with or without symptomatic PAD and its severity as defined by walking distance. Furthermore, the PAQ subscales were directly proportional to the presence and number of risk factors relevant for PAD. For studying outcomes in PAD patients, the disease-specific PAQ is likely to be a more sensitive measure of treatment benefit as compared with the generic EQ VAS, although the latter may still be of value when comparing health status across different diseases. Regarding disease management, we advocate the use of the disease-specific PAQ as its greater sensitivity and validity will assist its translation into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is believed to occur when the local mechanical stress exceeds the local mechanical strength of the wall tissue. On the basis of this hypothesis, the knowledge of the stress acting on the wall of an unruptured aneurysm could be useful in determining the risk of rupture. The role of asymmetry has previously been identified in idealized AAA models and is now studied using realistic AAAs in the current work.\nFifteen patient-specific AAAs were studied to estimate the relationship between wall stress and geometrical parameters. Three-dimensional AAA models were reconstructed from computed tomography scan data. The stress distribution on the AAA wall was evaluated by the finite element method, and peak wall stress was compared with both diameter and centerline asymmetry. A simple method of determining asymmetry was adapted and developed. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential significance of results.\nMean von Mises peak wall stress +/- standard deviation was 0.4505 +/- 0.14 MPa (range, 0.3157-0.9048 MPa). Posterior wall stress increases with anterior centerline asymmetry. Peak stress increased by 48% and posterior wall stress by 38% when asymmetry was introduced into a realistic AAA model.\nThe relationship between posterior wall stress and AAA asymmetry showed that excessive bulging of one surface results in elevated wall stress on the opposite surface. Assessing the degree of bulging and asymmetry that is experienced in an individual AAA may be of benefit to surgeons in the decision-making process and may provide a useful adjunct to diameter as a surgical intervention guide.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the results and functioning of community-based supervised exercise therapy (SET) at one year of follow-up.\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study of community-based SET in regional physiotherapeutic practices. Consecutive patients with intermittent claudication referred for community-based SET were included. Exclusion criteria for SET were pain at rest or tissue loss. All patients received a diagnostic workup consisting of an ankle-brachial index at rest and after exercise. Interventions were exercise therapy according to the guidelines of the Royal Dutch Society for Physiotherapy. The primary outcome measurement was the increase in absolute claudication distance (ACD), assessed using a standardized treadmill protocol by a physiotherapist at baseline and at four, 12, 26, and 52 weeks of SET.\nFrom January 2005 through September 2006, 349 patients were referred by vascular surgeons for community-based SET. A total of 272 patients with intermittent claudication began the program. Of the 349 initially referred patients, 52 could not perform a standard treadmill test but did start community-based SET at a lower level, and 25 patients never started the program. At one year, 129 of the original 272 patients who began community-based SET (47.4%) were available for analysis of walking distance. In the interim, 143 patients discontinued the program for the following reasons: satisfaction with the acquired walking distance (n = 19); unsatisfying results (n = 26); not motivated (n = 22); (non)vascular intercurrent disease (n = 48); and other reasons (n = 28). ACD increased significantly from a median of 400 m at baseline to 1100 m after 12 months of follow-up (P < .001), corresponding to a median increase of 107.8%.\nCommunity-based SET seems as effective as SET in a hospital-based approach in improving walking distance, however, it has a high dropout rate.",

    "abstract": "The brachial artery is often used for coronary angiography. However, data on brachial access for aortic and peripheral interventions are limited. This study evaluated our experience with brachial artery catheterization for diagnostic arteriography and endovascular interventions.\nBetween August 2004 and August 2005, 2026 endovascular procedures were performed. Of these, 323 cases (16%) in 289 patients required brachial artery access, forming the basis for this study. Patients who underwent multiple interventions, but with a single access (ie, thrombolysis), were considered a single case. Demographic and clinical data were recorded in a database and analyzed using logistic regression analyses with generalized estimating equations and the Fisher exact test for nominal variables.\nThe mean age of all patients was 66.4 years, with 57% men. Brachial access was used for diagnostic purposes in 27% and for interventions including angioplasty, stenting, and thrombolysis in 73%. The use of brachial access was considered obligatory in 40%, adjunctive in 19% (ie, endovascular repair of abdominal aortic and thoracic aortic aneurysms) and preferential to femoral access in 41%. In 91% of patients, the brachial arteries were accessed percutaneously, and 9% underwent surgical cutdown for access. In patients whose brachial artery was approached percutaneously, access was achieved in all but one (99.6% technical success rate). Hemostasis after catheterization was achieved by manual compression in 89%. Operative mortality rate was 6.2% and not related to brachial artery access. Brachial access site-related complications occurred in 21 patients (6.5%). Thirteen of these 21 patients (62%) required a surgical correction, mostly for brachial artery thrombosis or pseudoaneurysm. Patients with complications were more commonly women (odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-13.26; P = .003) and had a long interventional sheath (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.53-29.07; P = .012). The risk of a brachial artery complication was not associated with thrombolysis, procedure type, vascular territory treated, or the use of heparin. No upper extremity limb or finger loss occurred.\nBrachial artery access is necessary for complex endovascular procedures and can be achieved in most patients safely. Postprocedural vigilance is warranted because most patients with complications will require operative correction.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors for perioperative and late mortality after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) remain ill-defined. In this study, we examined the prognostic significance of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a well-known predictor of death after thoracic aorta open repair, employing a stratification based on CKD stages derived from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values.\nA prospective database was evaluated for 179 consecutive patients electively submitted to TEVAR between 1999 and 2007. Preoperative GFR was estimated by using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Patient groups were stratified into four quartiles by baseline serum creatinine (SC) and GFR values, with quartile I being the lowest, and quartile IV the highest, and into the five CKD stages in reverse order (I GFR >or= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2); II 60-89; III 30-59; IV 15-29; V < 15). Prognostic significance of preoperative GFR values and CKD stages were investigated by means of univariate and multivariate analyses, and the Kaplan-Meier log-rank method.\nA primary technical success was achieved in 166 of 179 patients (92.7%), and an initial clinical success in 158 (88.3%). Thirty-day mortality was 5% (nine cases). Paraplegia or paraparesis were observed in 11 (6.1%) patients, and completely resolved in six cases after cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Preoperative GFR quartiles and CKD stages were significant predictors of 30-day mortality (P = .004 and P < .0001 respectively), whereas SC quartiles did not affect the outcome (P = .12). In particular, GFR quartile I (<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was associated with a ten-fold greater risk of perioperative death compared with the other three quartiles (Odds Ratio 11.4, 95% Confidence Interval 2.3-57.0, P = .003). Midterm survival was 88.8% (159 of 179) at a mean follow-up of 35.6 +/- 23.7 months. Actuarial survival at 60 months was 57.8%, 81.1%, 92.3%, and 100% for GFR quartiles I to IV respectively (P < .0001), and 0.0%, 66.7%, 59.2%, 88.6%, and 100% (P < .0001) for CKD stage V to I respectively. At univariate analyses, age (P = .019), preoperative SC quartiles (P = .001), GFR quartiles (P = .0002), and CKD stages (P < .0001) were all predictive of mid-term mortality. At multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, only CKD stages remained independently associated with the outcome (P = .008).\nGFR is an accurate prognostic predictor in patients submitted to TEVAR. Also, perioperative and midterm mortality directly correlate with the severity of CKD stages, allowing a risk stratification model to be employed both for risk-adjusted preoperative evaluation, and to establish accurate matching criteria for comparative studies.",

Paraplegia or paraparesis were observed in 11 (6.1%) patients, and completely resolved in six cases after cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Preoperative GFR quartiles and CKD stages were significant predictors of 30-day mortality (P = .004 and P < .0001 respectively), whereas SC quartiles did not affect the outcome (P = .12). In particular, GFR quartile I (<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was associated with a ten-fold greater risk of perioperative death compared with the other three quartiles (Odds Ratio 11.4, 95% Confidence Interval 2.3-57.0, P = .003). Midterm survival was 88.8% (159 of 179) at a mean follow-up of 35.6 +/- 23.7 months. Actuarial survival at 60 months was 57.8%, 81.1%, 92.3%, and 100% for GFR quartiles I to IV respectively (P < .0001), and 0.0%, 66.7%, 59.2%, 88.6%, and 100% (P < .0001) for CKD stage V to I respectively. At univariate analyses, age (P = .019), preoperative SC quartiles (P = .001), GFR quartiles (P = .0002), and CKD stages (P < .0001) were all predictive of mid-term mortality. At multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, only CKD stages remained independently associated with the outcome (P = .008).",

    "abstract": "Older patients are thought to tolerate acute ischemia more poorly than younger patients. Since aging may depress both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, we determined the effects of age on both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in a model of severe acute limb ischemia.\nYoung adult (3-months-old) and aged (18-months-old) C57BL/6 mice underwent right common iliac artery and vein ligation and transection. Data were collected on days 0, 7, and 14. Perfusion was measured with a laser Doppler scan and compared to the contralateral limb. Functional deficits were evaluated with the Tarlov scale. Capillary density and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) number were determined by direct counting lectin-positive/alpha-actin-negative cells and VEGFR2/CXCR4 dually-positive cells, respectively; angiography was performed to directly assess arteriogenesis.\nYoung adult and aged mice had a similar degree of decreased perfusion after iliac ligation (young, n = 15: 20.4 +/- 1.9%, vs aged, n = 20: 19.6 +/- 1.3%; P = .72, analysis of variance [ANOVA]); however, young mice recovered faster and to a greater degree than aged mice (day 7, 35 +/- 6% vs 17 +/- 4%, P = .046; day 14, 60 +/- 5% vs 27 +/- 7%, P = .0014). Aged mice had worse functional recovery by day 14 compared to young mice (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 4.3 +/- 0.4; P = .0021). Aged mice had increased capillary density (day 7, 12.9 +/- 4.4 vs 2.8 +/- 0.3 capillaries/hpf; P = .02) and increased number of EPC incorporated into the ischemic muscle (day 7, 8.1 +/- 0.9 vs 2.5 +/- 1.9 cells; P = .007) compared to young mice, but diminished numbers of collateral vessels to the ischemic limb (1 vs 9; P = .01), as seen on angiography.\nAfter severe hind limb ischemia, aged animals become ischemic to a similar degree as young animals, but aged animals have significantly impaired arteriogenesis and functional recovery compared to younger animals. These results suggest that strategies to stimulate arteriogenesis may complement those that increase angiogenesis, and may result in improved relief of ischemia.",

    "abstract": "N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is secreted by the heart in response to ventricular wall stress and has prognostic value in patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease, and heart valve abnormalities. Postoperative and long-term outcome is also related to these risk factors. This study assessed the additional prognostic value of NT-proBNP levels as a simple objective risk marker for postoperative cardiac events among vascular surgery patients.\nA detailed cardiac history (angina, myocardial infarction, age >70 years, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, stroke, heart failure), resting echocardiography, and NT-proBNP levels were obtained in 400 vascular surgery patients. Postoperative troponin-T levels and an electrocardiogram were obtained on days 1, 3, 7, and 30, and whenever clinically indicated. Patients were monitored every 6 months at the outpatient clinic. Study end points were perioperative cardiac events (ie, composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and troponin release) and long-term all-cause mortality. The additional value of NT-proBNP was assessed with multivariable regression analysis. The optimal cutoff value was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.\nPostoperative troponin T release occurred in 79 patients (20%). Cardiac risk factors were used to classify patients as low (0 risk factors), intermediate (1 to 2), and high (>3) cardiac risk (event rate of 7%, 15%, and 37%, respectively). The median NT-proBNP level was 206 pg/mL (interquartile range, 80-548 pg/mL). The risk of postoperative cardiac events was augmented with increasing NT-proBNP, irrespective of underlying cardiac risk factors and type of vascular surgery. In addition to cardiac risk factors only (C index, 0.66) or cardiac risk factors and site and type of surgery (C index, 0.81), NT-proBNP was an excellent tool for further risk stratification (C index, 0.86), with an optimal cutoff value of 350 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, NT-proBNP >350 pg/mL remained significantly associated with perioperative cardiac events (odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-10.5, P < .001). NT-proBNP >350 pg/mL was also associated with an independent 1.9-fold (95% CI 1.1-3.2) increased risk for long-term mortality during a median follow-up of 2.4 years.\nNT-proBNP is an independent prognostic marker for postoperative cardiac events and long-term mortality in patients undergoing different types of vascular surgery and might be used for preoperative cardiac risk stratification.",

The primary outcome was residual GSV 6 months after surgery measured by venous duplex ultrasound imaging. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, operation time, and postoperative neural damage. Duration of follow-up was 6 months. Quality of life was measured at 6 and 26 weeks postoperatively with the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey.\nThe two groups were well matched at baseline. The percentage of patients with residual GSV at 6 months (primary outcome) was 44% (102 of 230) in the cryo group and 15% (33 of 215) in the conventional group (difference 29%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-37%, P < .001). Median operation time was significantly shorter in the cryo group (30 minutes) compared with the conventional group (39 minutes). Neural damage was 12% in both groups, and thus not significantly different. Scores on the subdomains of the SF-36 showed no significant change between the groups. The AVVQ after conventional stripping was 8.0, which was a better result than the 11.7 result after cryo stripping (difference 2.6 points; 95% CI, 1.0-4.2; P = .001, repeated measurements analysis of variance with adjustment for baseline scores).\nCryo stripping accounts for numerous procedural failures and hence residual GSV in patients.

    "abstract": "Percutaneous iliofemoral venous stenting has been shown to be effective, safe, and durable in both nonthrombotic iliac vein lesion (NIVL) and postthrombotic disease. A small fraction of stented limbs require reintervention to correct stent malfunction. This manuscript examines the reasons for reintervention, types of procedures performed, and outcome.\nFemoro-ilio-caval stenting was performed in 1085 limbs over a 10 year period from 1997 to 2007 (NIVL/postthrombotic limb ratio 1:1). Reinterventions were required in 137 limbs (13%) for non-occlusive stent malfunction.\nMedian time of reintervention after the initial procedure was 15 months. Primary indication for reintervention was stent abnormalities discovered on routine surveillance imaging in 31% of the limbs and residual/recurrent symptoms after initial stenting in 69% of the limbs. Prevalent symptoms before reintervention were swelling (45%), pain (18%), combination of pain and swelling (33%), and venous dermatitis/ulcer (15%). Seventy-seven percent of limbs required only a single reintervention and 23% required two or more interventions. The type of reintervention could be broadly categorized into four types: (1) cephalad stent extension to correct stent outflow problems; (2) caudad stent extension to correct inflow problems; (3) balloon dilatation of stent stenoses; and (4) combinations. The types of stent inflow/outflow lesions encountered were different in NIVL and postthrombotic limbs. In both groups, the external iliac vein segment had a greater incidence of pathology than other stented venous segments during reintervention. A denovo stenotic lesion of uncertain aetiology that occurred below an existing stent was also exclusive to the external iliac vein segment. Instent restenosis (ISR) occurred in both subsets. Two types of ISR were encountered: (1) a 'soft' lesion probably due to reduced flow channel lined by thrombus within the stent from inflow/outflow problems and (2) a 'hard' lesion that occurred independently, was resistant to dilatation and tended to recur unlike the 'soft' lesion. Cumulative improvement in pain and swelling at 18 months following intervention was 67% and 72%, respectively. Complete cumulative healing of venous dermatitis/ulcer was 90% at 12 months post reintervention.\nVenous stenting for chronic venous disease is largely trouble-free with only a small fraction of the stented limbs requiring reinterventions. Reinterventions were performed to correct previously overlooked or new defects in inflow, outflow and/or the stent. Reinterventions are worthwhile since they improve residual/recurrent symptoms in a durable fashion.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has suggested that bone marrow derived progenitor cells may contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury, a process that classically has been believed to involve extracellular matrix deposition and the migration and proliferation of cells within the arterial wall. The first studies demonstrating the existence of bone marrow derived cells in the neointima employed mouse models of arterial injury in conjunction with whole bone marrow transplant. Later studies have shown specifically that bone marrow derived hematopoietic or mesenchymal stem cells can be recruited to the neointima and differentiate into smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells. Although the data vary widely depending on different animal models of arterial injury and methods of labeling bone marrow derived cells, it appears that progenitor cells do indeed contribute to intimal hyperplasia, at least in mouse models of arterial injury. To date, signaling molecules such as c-kit and c-kit ligand, and stromal derived factor-1alpha, in addition to matrix metalloproteinase-9, have emerged as critical factors that recruit progenitor cells to sites of arterial injury. While much progress has been made, several tasks remain, including the need for a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying progenitor cell recruitment, characterization of the involved progenitor cells, and finally validation that the observations made in these mouse models of disease are also applicable to human arterial restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Venous malformations (VMs) are common congenital benign lesions characterized by slow progression. However, intralesional hemorrhage can result in sudden enlargement of the lesions, which, though uncommon clinically, brings difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical features and diagnosis modality of intralesional hemorrhage in VMs and present our experience with embolosclerotherapy.\nA series of 16 patients were recruited from May 2003 to February 2007, of which fifteen were males and one was female, aged from five months to 40 years (mean, 11.4 years). The anatomic sites affected included cheek (n = 6), upper lid (n = 3), neck (n = 3), parotid region (n = 2), temple (n = 1), and upper limb (n = 1). The period of enlargement varied from one day to 25 days (mean, 8.4 days). Diagnostic needle aspiration was performed to analyze the internal contents of the masses by macroscopic observation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to determine the size, location, and extent of the lesions. Two patients received percutaneous venography. Routine blood testing was carried out in all cases. A combination of absolute alcohol and Bleomycin A5 embolosclerotherapy was administered to the patients. The procedure was repeated after 6 to 8 weeks. Outcomes were assessed by MRI measurement and pre and post treatment color photos.\nAll the patients were diagnosed with hemorrhage in VMs. The volume of the localized lesions varied from 3 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm to 8 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm. Fourteen patients received embolosclerotherapy in one (n = 10) or two (n = 4) sessions. Two cases were not treated and the lesions regressed spontaneously with detectable residual lesions. After a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 3 to 40 months), treatment was considered effective in 12 patients. The complications were minimal including temporary swelling in 14 treated patients and mild fever in two patients.\nIntralesional hemorrhage in VMs should be distinguished from other lesions in the head and neck region. Diagnostic puncture and MRI are essential for accurate diagnosis. Percutaneous embolosclerotherapy using a combination of absolute ethanol and Bleomycin A5 is a safe and effective treatment of choice.",

Herein we report a 47-year-old female diagnosed as traumatic aorto-superior mesenteric vein (Ao-SMV) fistula. The abdominal pain, fullness, and frank bruit on abdominal auscultation suggested the diagnosis of an intra-abdominal arteriovenous fistula. The diagnosis of Ao-SMV was further confirmed by the computed tomography (CT) and aortography. The fistula was successfully treated with transcatheter coil embolization. This is the first case of Ao-SMV fistula. It provides an alternative option of treatment other than conventional surgery.",

    "abstract": "Venous ulcers continue to cause problems for patients and health care systems. These are painful and unpleasant for the patient and expensive for health care providers to treat. This brief review highlights effective methods of management. There is level 1 evidence of the efficacy of compression (bandaging or stockings) in healing ulcers as well as maintaining healing. Patients with superficial saphenous reflux, with or without perforating and deep vein incompetence, benefit from superficial venous surgery. This does not speed ulcer healing but is effective at preventing recurrence after healing with compression. Minimally invasive methods of managing incompetence of superficial saphenous trunks, including endovenous laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and foam sclerotherapy are probably also effective in treating patients with venous leg ulcers. Perforating vein ligation is commonly combined with superficial venous surgery for leg ulcer patients, but no systematic data are available to define the role of this treatment. Some centers use deep vein reconstruction to restore competence to deep vein valves. Insufficient data have been published to allow any general recommendation to be made for this treatment. A limited number of drugs have efficacy in promoting leg ulcer healing. They may be used in combination with compression treatment in patients with ulcers refractory to other methods of management. No particular ulcer dressing has been shown to be effective in speeding ulcer healing.",

    "abstract": "Failure modes of thoracic endografts can be broadly categorized as those that typically occur early in the perioperative period and those that occur during late follow-up. In the former category, failures principally involve delivery, deployment, and conformation to the local anatomy. In the postoperative period, failures can manifest as endograft collapse, component separations, and metallic fractures and fabric tears. Some of these events are preventable with careful case selection, planning, and procedural technique, but others require active management with advanced endovascular or surgical adjuncts. No endograft system is immune from these problems. Endograft failure is an equal-opportunity hazard, which underscores the absolute need for diligent, long-term follow-up.",

We examined MMP-3 for its therapeutic potential to prevent smooth muscle cell migration and neointima formation in venous bypass grafts using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer.\nHuman aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were transduced with adenoviral vectors encoding ss-galactosidase (Ad.ssgal) [corrected] or human MMP-3 (Ad.hMMP-(3)), [corrected] and characterized for migration in the amniotic membrane stroma as an in vitro model of the vascular wall. Cholesterol-fed New Zealand white rabbits underwent jugular vein bypass grafting into carotid arteries. Before insertion, grafts were incubated ex vivo with either Ad.ssgal [corrected] or hMMP-3. Transgene expression was characterized by immunohistochemistry and in situ zymography. Grafts (n = 6) were explanted after 28 days and intimal hyperplasia was quantified.\nMigration of HASMC was significantly reduced when transduced with Ad.hMMP-(3) [corrected] compared to controls (P < .001). Immunocytochemistry of Ad.hMMP-(3) [corrected] transduced venous grafts localized this protein to the intima. In situ-zymography showed increased MMP activity in the intima of Ad.hMMP-(3) [corrected] transfected grafts.

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is thought to play a central role in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) initiation. Doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue, has direct MMP-9-inhibiting properties in vitro, and it effectively suppresses AAA development in rodents. Observed inhibition of AAA progression, and contradictory findings in human studies evaluating the effect of doxycycline therapy on aortic wall MMP-9, suggest that the effects of doxycycline extend beyond MMP-9 inhibition and that the effect may be dose-dependent.\nThis clinical trial evaluated the effect of 2 weeks of low- (50 mg/d), medium- (100 mg/d), or high-dose (300 mg/d) doxycycline vs no medication in four groups of 15 patients undergoing elective AAA repair. The effect of doxycycline treatment on MMP and cysteine proteases, and their respective inhibitors, was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, immunocapture protease activity assays, and immunohistochemistry.\nDoxycycline was well tolerated and no participants dropped out. Doxycycline treatment reduced aortic wall MMP-3 and MMP-25 messenger RNA expression (P < .045 and P < .014, respectively), selectively suppressed neutrophil collagenase and gelatinase (MMP-8 and MMP-9) protein levels (P < .013 and <.004, respectively), and increased protein levels of the protease inhibitors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and cystatin C (P < .029). As for the apparent selective effect on neutrophil-associated proteases, we sought for a reducing effect on aortic wall neutrophil content that was indeed confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis that revealed a 75% reduction in aneurysm wall neutrophil content (P < .001).\nIndependent of its dose, short-term preoperative doxycycline therapy improves the proteolytic balance in AAA, presumably through an effect on aortic wall neutrophil content. This study provides a rationale for doxycycline treatment in patients with an AAA as well as in other (vascular) conditions involving neutrophil influx such as Kawasaki disease and Beh\u00e7et disease.",

    "abstract": "Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to induced warm ischemia (WI) results in inflammatory and delayed fibrotic processes and remains a common clinical problem with serious consequences. Because tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a prominent proinflammatory factor implicated in the pathophysiology of acute renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), we hypothesized that FR167653 (FR), a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta production, may reduce IRI.\nIRI was induced in male pigs by bilateral clamping of the renal pedicle for 90 minutes (WI90), or unilateral renal clamping (90 minutes) after contralateral nephrectomy (1/2Nx90), or unilateral renal clamping without contralateral nephrectomy (WIuni90). FR was administered intravenously 60 minutes before WI (1 mg/kg/h), during WI, and continuously for 3 hours (1 mg/kg/h) during reperfusion in treated groups (FRWI90, FR1/2Nx90, or FRWIuni90). Blood and urine samples were collected between day 1 and 3 months after reperfusion for assessment of renal function. Kidneys were excised and renal tissues were collected at 3 months for morphologic and inflammation evaluation and protein analysis. Experimental groups were compared with sham operated (control) and heminephrectomized (Unif) groups without renal ischemia.\nThree WI90 animals (43%) and five 1/2Nx90 (70%) were euthanized and necropsied at day 7 because of no urine production or poor conditions. Mortality was significantly improved after FR treatment. Survival was 100% in the control, Unif, WIuni90, and FR groups. In Unif groups, FR significantly reduced renal failure and bilateral renal ischemia (P < .05). At 3 months, proteinuria was significantly reduced in FR-treated groups (P < .01). Inflammatory cells count was also dramatically diminished in FR-treated pigs (P < .01 for CD3-positive cells). The second aspect of transient ischemia is the fibrotic process determined at 3 months. FR treatment was characterized by a reduction of renal fibrosis, particularly in Unif groups. TNF-alpha protein expression was diminished in FR-treated groups.\nThis is the first evidence that FR reduced the early and long-term effect of WI in the severe ischemia model. This effect was particularly marked against fibrosis and inflammation, which would contribute to deterioration of a patient's renal function.",

    "abstract": "To compare the progression rate of primary with secondary chronic venous disease (CVD).\nPatients with a first episode of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), diagnosed by duplex ultrasound (DU) were included in group A - secondary CVD (41 patients, 46 limbs). DU was performed at least once, 1 year after the diagnosis, and repeated at 5 years. Group B - primary CVD (41 patients, 50 limbs) included age- and sex-matched patients with primary CVD and duration of 5 to 10 years to be comparable with that of group A. They had no history of DVT and were referred for reflux evaluation. All their veins were free of postthrombotic signs upon DU examination. Group C (15 patients, 30 limbs) had no signs and symptoms of CVD and were examined at baseline and 5 years later. This group of patients was also matched for age and sex. Clinic examinations were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. The CEAP system was used to grade disease severity. The proximal veins were divided in the CFV, FV, and POPV segments for analysis. Thrombosed veins were subsequently graded as complete, partial, and fully recanalized. Recurrent DVT cases were also recorded.\nAt 5-year follow-up, the prevalence of skin damage was significantly higher in group A (11/46 vs group B 3/50, P = .019 and vs group C 0/30, P < .01). The progression to skin damage in group A was faster as it changed from 4% (2/46) at 1 year (P = 0.014) compared with the two other groups. In group A, 22 limbs had reflux, three had obstruction, 19 had combine reflux and obstruction, and two were normal. In group B, superficial, deep, and perforator vein reflux were seen in 50, 4, and 15 limbs, respectively. In group C, five limbs in four patients developed superficial reflux in which only two had symptoms. The CEAP class in this group was C0N = 25, C1 = 3, and C2 = 2. In group A, skin damage was significantly higher in limbs with combined proximal and distal obstruction as well as in limbs with combined reflux and obstruction (P = .012 and P = 0.013, respectively). DVT was found in 108 segments (25 CFV, 40 FV, and in 43 POPV), 82 at the first episode and 26 as an ipsilateral recurrence. Ipsilateral and contralateral recurrences were seen in 21.9% and 9.8% of patients, respectively. Complete recanalization occurred in 43 segments, partial in 55, and none in 10. Reflux occurred in 85.5% and 60.5% of the partially and completely recanalized segments, respectively (P = .006).\nThe progression of CVD is more rapid in postthrombotic limbs when compared with those with primary CVD. The incidence of CVD in normal individuals is small and its progression is slow. Poor prognostic factors for progression to advanced CVD include the combination of reflux and obstruction, ipsilateral recurrent DVT, and multi-segmental involvement.",

    "abstract": "To produce a comprehensive anatomical and hemodynamic ultrasound scan mapping of the whole limb in patients with primary varicose veins (VVs).\nAn analysis of venous duplex scans performed on patients referred for treatment of primary VVs.\nA total of 2036 limbs were evaluated, looking for the origin of VVs in the saphenous systems and in the perforating vein (PV) systems, as well as for the presence of non-saphenous reflux.\nThe sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) was involved in 1330 limbs (65.3%). We have noted that finding reflux in the groin does not imply that it originates at that point necessarily, as reflux from the pelvis or abdominal wall can also cause primary VVs (SFJ reflux, 41.9% and competent SFJ with reflux from proximal veins, 35.4%). We also noted that analyzing only the presence of reflux in the SFJ of the GSV would miss 10.9% of limbs of reflux in the SFJ of the anterior accessory GSV. In 237 limbs (11.6%), reflux was observed in the popliteal fossa. In the PV system, we distinguished those PVs with retrograde flow that acted as an origin of the VVs, and other PVs that acted as re-entry points. Based on this difference, the location identified as the most frequent origin of VVs in the PV system was the thigh, specifically in the group of PVs of the medial thigh of the femoral canal, with 85 PVs with a total of 238 incompetent PVs identified. Pure non-saphenous reflux was observed in 162 limbs (8%).\nThe assumption that the origin of VVs would be exclusively in the sapheno-femoral or sapheno-popliteal junction, is a mistaken attitude and a comprehensive duplex scan mapping is recommended.",

We also noted that analyzing only the presence of reflux in the SFJ of the GSV would miss 10.9% of limbs of reflux in the SFJ of the anterior accessory GSV. In 237 limbs (11.6%), reflux was observed in the popliteal fossa. In the PV system, we distinguished those PVs with retrograde flow that acted as an origin of the VVs, and other PVs that acted as re-entry points. Based on this difference, the location identified as the most frequent origin of VVs in the PV system was the thigh, specifically in the group of PVs of the medial thigh of the femoral canal, with 85 PVs with a total of 238 incompetent PVs identified. Pure non-saphenous reflux was observed in 162 limbs (8%).",

    "abstract": "Vascular reconstruction in the setting of primary arterial or prosthetic graft infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cryopreserved human allografts (CHA) may serve as acceptable alternatives when autogenous or extra-anatomic/in situ prosthetic reconstructions are not possible.\nBetween February 1999 and June 2008, 57 CHAs were placed in 52 patients (average age, 65 years) for abdominal aortic (n = 18) or iliofemoral/femoral-popliteal arterial or prosthetic infections (n = 39). Indications for arterial reconstruction included infected implanted prosthetic material (n = 39), mycotic pseudoaneurysms (n = 14), or intra-abdominal bacterial contamination or wound infection (n = 4). Wide local debridement and culture was followed by allograft interposition, bypass, or extra-anatomic reconstruction. Over a similar time period, 53 non-CHA extra-anatomical prosthetic or in situ autogenous tissue reconstructions were performed in 53 patients (average age, 65 years) for abdominal aortic (n = 18) or iliofemoral and femoral-popliteal (n = 35) prosthetic graft infections. Indications for arterial replacement in all cases included infected implanted prosthetic material.\nThirty-day mortality for all CHA and non-CHA reconstructions was 5.2% and 7.5%, respectively. The 1-year procedure-related mortality for all CHA and non-CHA procedures was 7.0% and 13.2%, respectively. In the CHA cohort, 5 patients required re-exploration for hemorrhage or anastomotic disruption. In midterm CHA follow-up (20 months), there was 1 graft thrombosis, 2 graft stenoses, 1 recurrent ilioenteric fistula, and 1 non-related amputation. The remainder of the CHA reconstructions remained patent without evidence of aneurysmal change or reinfection.\nIn the setting of infection, cryopreserved human allograft arterial reconstruction is a viable alternative to traditional methods of vascular reconstruction in patients without available autogenous conduit and when expedient reconstruction is required. In midterm follow-up, cryopreserved allografts appear to be resistant to subsequent reinfection, thrombosis, or aneurysmal dilatation. However, larger patient populations and longer follow-up are needed to determine if arterial reconstruction with CHA is the safest and most durable method of treatment for arterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular intervention is increasingly accepted as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of tibial vessel disease. Tibial vessel disease can occur in isolation or in conjunction with disease that involves the proximal lower extremity vasculature (multilevel disease). This study evaluated the overall efficacy of endovascular intervention for tibial vessel disease and whether the requirement for single-level compared with multilevel intervention affected outcomes.\nThis study evaluated a consecutive unselected group of patients who underwent an infrapopliteal intervention from November 2002 to February 2008. The primary end points evaluated were technical success, limb salvage, primary patency, and secondary patency. The secondary end points evaluated were 30-day access site (ie, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and wound infection), intervention site (ie, thrombosis), and systemic (ie, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, and mortality) complications. Patency and limb salvage were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life-table analyses and compared using Cox regression analysis. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe study comprised 85 patients, 89 limbs, and 114 procedures. Age was 72.4 +/- 13.1 years, 67% were men, and follow-up was 245.8 +/- 290.8 days. The technical success rate for all procedures was 91%. Limb salvage rates for patients with critical limb ischemia at 6, 12 and 18 months were 85% +/- 0%, 81% +/- 0%, and 69% +/- 0%, respectively. For the complete patient cohort, primary patency rates at 6, 12 and 18 months were 68% +/- 6%, 50% +/- 8%, and 37% +/- 9%, respectively, and secondary patency rates were 81% +/- 5%, 71% +/- 7%, and 63% +/- 8%. Multilevel intervention was associated with significantly improved secondary patency compared with single-level intervention (P = .045).\nPatency and limb salvage rates for endovascular treatment of tibial vessel disease in this study are comparable with prior reports and with historical surgical controls. Patients who undergo multilevel intervention involving the tibial vessels exhibit improved secondary patency compared with those who undergo intervention for lesions isolated to the tibial vessels. This may reflect increased distal disease burden for patients who undergo isolated tibial intervention. The study data suggest that the presence of multilevel disease should not preclude an attempt at percutaneous revascularization. Further study is required before formulating definitive recommendations for the endovascular treatment of tibial vessel disease.",

The effect of more intense dual antiplatelet therapy required for CAS on the frequency of ICH has not been established. This study was undertaken to evaluate the nationwide occurrence of ICH associated with CAS vs CEA.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients discharged after CAS and CEA during 2005. The type of revascularization and major adverse events, ie, in-hospital ICH, postprocedural stroke, and death rates, were determined by cross-tabulating specific procedural codes for CAS and CEA and diagnostic codes for carotid stenosis. Risk stratification was performed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between type of revascularization, comorbidities, ICH, and risk-adjusted mortality.\nIn 2005, the estimated number of carotid revascularizations was 135,903. The vast majority of patients underwent CEA (90.4%), whereas CAS was performed in 13,093 (9.6%) patients. Most patients (92.2%) underwent treatment for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. CAS patients had higher postoperative stroke rates (2.1% vs 1.1%; P < .001) and in-hospital mortality (1.1% vs 0.6%; P < .001) than CEA patients. ICH occurred in 19 patients (0.15%) after CAS and in 20 patients (0.016%) after CEA (P < .001). CAS was identified as an independent predictor for postoperative stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.0; P < .001), in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P < .001) and ICH (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 3.1-11.1; P < .001) after adjusting for age, gender, symptomatic status, comorbidities, admission, and hospital type using logistic regression. In-hospital mortality was 12.5% among patients developing ICH (OR, 23.2; 95% CI, 9.1-54.4; P < .001).\nIn the United States, patients undergoing CAS have not only significantly increased postoperative stroke and death rates compared with those undergoing CEA, but also a sixfold increased risk of ICH. Although ICH after CAS is extremely rare, its devastating nature and high mortality warrant further investigation to define specific risk factors, prevention, and treatment strategies.",

Results were used in patient selection and then analyzed retrospectively to determine clinical utility.\nAnalysis of 3D-CTA data by the operating surgeon allowed stratification of patients into four groups: (1) appropriate for CAS via femoral approach (n = 37, 63%); (2) appropriate for CAS with transcervical access due to adverse arch anatomy (n = 2, 3%); (3) borderline anatomy for CAS (n = 5, 9%); or (4) not appropriate anatomy for CAS (n = 15, 25%). Group 1 had 100% technical success with one minor stroke. Group 2 had successful transcervical CAS without stroke. Group 3 patients underwent arteriography but CAS was aborted in four out of five cases for the same reason that had been identified by 3D-CTA (internal carotid artery [ICA] tortuosity n = 2, ICA string sign with distal disease n = 2). The one failure in group 3 was the result of a previously placed common carotid stent extending into an already unfavorable aortic arch. Group 4 patients underwent endarterectomy (n = 7) or continued medical management (n = 8) instead of CAS (without arteriography) because of the following reasons, cited alone or in combination: common carotid tandem stenosis n = 5, difficult arch anatomy n = 2, ICA tortuosity n = 2, extreme lesion calcification or length n = 4, ICA string sign or occlusion n = 3, concomitant intracranial disease n = 2, and stenosis overestimated by duplex n = 3. The overall 30-day stroke rate, on an intention to treat basis, for patients that underwent preprocedural 3D-CTA was 2.3% (one major [NIH stroke scale >3] and one minor stroke).\nIn our initial experience, 3D-CTA reconstruction of the aortic arch and carotid arteries significantly influenced the plan for CAS in 37% of patients. Patients with clear anatomic contraindications to CAS can be excluded without the risks of arteriography. 3D-CTA further facilitates the CAS procedure by anticipating potential procedural. The cost-effectiveness and potential impact of this imaging modality on CAS outcomes deserve further study.",

    "abstract": "The differential effect of open-cell vs closed-cell stent design configuration on carotid velocities detected by duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging has not been established. To identify possible stent design differences in carotid velocities, we analyzed DUS studies obtained before and immediately after carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nIn a series of 141 CAS procedures performed during a 3-year period, data from the first postinterventional DUS images and carotid angiograms were evaluated for each patient. Peak systolic velocities (PSV), end-diastolic velocities (EDV), and internal carotid artery/common carotid artery (ICA/CCA) PSV ratios were compared according to stent design. Differences in carotid velocities were analyzed using nonparametric statistical tests.\nCompletion angiograms revealed successful revascularization and <30% residual stenosis in each case. The 30-day stroke-death rate in this series was 1.6% and was unrelated to stent type. Postintervention DUS images were obtained a median of 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1-25 days) after CAS. Closed-cell stents were used in 41 procedures (29%) and open-cell stents in 100 (71%). The median PSV was 95.9 cm/s (IQR, 77-123 cm/s) for open-cell stents and 122 cm/s (IQR, 89-143 cm/s) for closed-cell stents, which was significantly higher (P = .007). Closed-cell stents also had significantly higher median EDVs (36 vs 29 cm/s; P =.006) and ICA/CCA PSV ratios (1.6 vs 1.1; P =.017). By DUS criteria, the carotid velocities in 45% of closed-cell stents exceeded the threshold of 50% stenosis for a nonstented artery compared with 26% of open-cell stents (P =.04). Closed-cell stents had a 2.2-fold increased risk of yielding abnormally elevated carotid velocities after CAS compared with open-cell stents (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-4.9).\nCarotid velocities are disproportionately elevated after CAS with closed-cell stents compared with open-cell stents. This suggests that the velocity criteria for quantifying stenosis may require modification according to stent design. The importance of these differences in carotid velocities related to stent design and the potential relationship with recurrent stenosis remains to be established.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VT) after aortic abdominal aneurysm (AAA) surgery is imprecisely reported. On one hand, thromboprophylaxis has improved, on the other hand, AAA patients have become older and/or present worse comorbidities. Herein, we prospectively analyzed the incidence of VT in a continuous series of patients operated on for AAA repair and looked for predictive factors.\nBetween January 1, 2005, and December, 31, 2006, 193 consecutive patients (177 men and 16 women), mean age 73 (range, 47-93) underwent elective AAA repair, 137 open (71%) and 56 endovascular (29%), in our institution. Thromboprophylaxis consisted of thigh-length compression bandages or stockings, early mobilization, and a daily subcutaneous injection of low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin 40 mg per day). Patients with renal insufficiency or aged over 80 were given unfractionated heparin (5000 IU twice a day). Heparin was started between day 1 and day 5 (median = day 1) after surgery, according to the prescription of the surgeon. A bilateral lower limb duplex venous compression ultrasonography scan using 3 to 7.5 MHz transducers was systematically done before and after surgery in each patient. Two groups were considered: group 1 with postoperative VT (n = 17) and group 2 without (n = 176). The 17 patients with VT were compared with 51 patients randomly chosen among the 176 patients without VT. Different characteristics such as venous risk factors, preoperative antithrombotic treatment, anatomical features of the AAA, and perioperative data were studied.\nSeventeen patients (8.1%) were diagnosed with postoperative VT (15 asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and 2 symptomatic pulmonary embolisms [PE]). VTE tended to be more frequent in open (10.2%) than endovascular (5.3%) repair (P = .28). Among perioperative data, delay to thromboprophylaxis was related to bleeding complication (P = .05) and blood transfusion (P = .02), and tended to be longer in VT patients (1.7 +/- 1.4 vs 0.9 +/- 0.9 day; P = .09).\nDespite systematic prevention with heparin, surgery for AAA repair induces a high incidence of postoperative VT. This series mandates for vigilance about VT, with particular attention to the patients who received transfusion with fresh frozen plasma. Even though this series is one of the largest ever published on this topic, the rarity of the events calls for confirmation with a larger prospective study.",

    "abstract": "Surgical management of acute, complicated type B aortic dissection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study examined the feasibility and safety of endovascular treatment of this pathology.\nWe reviewed a prospectively maintained thoracic endovascular database and medical records at a single institution from 2005 to 2007. The study group comprised of acute, complicated type B dissections, defined as duration of symptoms <or=14 days and involving either false lumen rupture, malperfusion, intractable pain, or uncontrolled hypertension. All repairs were performed using the TAG device (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz). Select 30-day or in-hospital outcomes were reported.\nOf the 216 thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs performed during the study period, 33 (15%) were for acute, complicated type B dissections. There were eight women (24%). The mean age was 61 +/- 15 years. The average duration of symptoms was 2.9 +/- 4.1 (median, 1) days. The indications for repair included rupture in 15 patients (46%) and mesenteric/renal/lower extremity malperfusion in 11 (33%). Mean fluoroscopy time and contrast volume were 30 +/- 16 minutes and 176 +/- 55 mL, respectively. Eight (73%) of 11 patients with malperfusion required branch vessel stenting. The 30-day in-hospital mortality was 21% (7 of 33). Causes of death included cardiac arrest in 3, progressive multisystem organ failure in 2, rupture in 1 and unknown in 1. At least one major complication occurred in 76% of the patients, including respiratory failure in 11 (33%), permanent spinal cord ischemia in 5 (15%), renal failure requiring dialysis in 4 (12%), and stroke in 4 (12%). The mean postoperative length of stay was 17.2 +/- 16.5 days, and only 14 (42%) were discharged to home.\nEmergency endovascular repair of acute, complicated type B dissection is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The overall role of this therapy in the treatment of this lethal problem should be better defined and compared with other surgical or interventional options before being generally adopted.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinaemia is associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). There are inter-individual variations in the metabolism of homocysteine because of genetic polymorphisms. This study analyzed the role of one polymorphism that is associated with raised homocysteine, as a risk factor for PAD.\nThis study considered the association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphisms with the incidence of PAD by performing a case-control study and a cross sectional study of homocysteine levels. We recruited 133 patients with PAD in Norfolk and compared the MTHFR allele distribution with 457 healthy individuals. We also carried out a meta-analysis to place our data within the context of other published studies. We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to March 2008 for any studies on the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and PAD.\nThe MTHFR C677T allele frequencies in the cases and controls were 0.37 and 0.33, and the odds ratios for the association of the 677 T allele or TT genotype with PAD were 1.18 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.89, 1.58) and 1.99 (95% CI 1.09, 3.63). Homozygotes for the MTHFR C677T mutation had higher concentrations of plasma total homocysteine, odds ratio 2.82 (95% CI 1.03, 7.77) compared to homozygotes for the MTHFR 677 CC genotype. Twelve of 72 articles retrieved from the database search reported the prevalence of mutations in PAD patients. A meta-analysis of 9 appropriate studies, including our own, showed that being homozygous for the C677T allele was associated with an increased risk of PAD, pooled odds ratio 1.36 (95% CI 1.09, 1.68).\nWe have found a strong association between raised homocysteine, the TT genotype, and PAD.",

    "abstract": "To assess long-term quality of life outcomes in patients following transaxillary first-rib resection and scalenectomy for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).\nThis was a prospective observational study using the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) and Disability of Arm, Hand, and Shoulder (DASH) instruments between February 2005 and March 2008 in patients with TOS presenting to an academic medical center for preoperative surgical evaluation after failing physical therapy protocol. Surveys were conducted preoperatively and then again at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. Longitudinal data analysis was performed with population-averaged models using generalized estimating equations (GEE) method for average rate of recovery. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze time to return to work.\nA total of 70 out of 105 eligible patients (66.7%) completed the study protocol (44 neurogenic; 26 venous), returning 243 valid SF-12 surveys (162 neurogenic; 81 venous) and 188 valid DASH surveys (124 neurogenic; 64 venous). Half (50%) of the neurogenic patients and 77% of the venous patients returned to full-time work or activity within the study follow-up, with half of them doing so by 4 months and 75% of them by 5 months. There was no statistically significant difference in return to work between the neurogenic or venous patients. Neurogenic patients had baseline SF-12 Physical Component Scores (PCS) similar to chronic heart failure patients and were significantly worse than venous patients (33.8 vs 43.6, P < .001). In contrast, no difference existed in Mental Component Scores (MCS) (44.5 vs 43.5, P = .78). In follow-up, on average, PCS scores for neurogenic patients improved 0.24 points (P < .001) and MCS scores improved 0.15 points per month (P = .01); while PCS scores for venous patients improved 0.40 points (P = .004) and MCS scores improved 0.55 points per month (P < .001). Additionally, neurogenic patients had baseline DASH scores that were similar to patients with rotator cuff tears, and they were also significantly worse than venous patients (50.2 vs 25.0, P < .001). DASH scores, on average, also improved 0.85 points (P < .001) for neurogenic patients and 0.81 points (P < .001) for venous patients per month.\nThe use of the SF-12 and DASH instruments in patients with TOS demonstrated significant improvement in patients postoperatively. Venous TOS patients typically improved both physical and mental scores in shorter periods of time than their neurogenic counterparts. Neurogenic and venous TOS patients returned to full-time work/activity within the same length of time postoperatively. However, neurogenic patients required more secondary interventions. We conclude that in appropriately selected patients with either neurogenic or venous TOS, surgical intervention can improve their quality of life over time.",

    "abstract": "Penetrating common femoral artery injuries are life-threatening, especially when the femoral bifurcation has been destroyed. In the presence of other associated injuries which preclude immediate definitive vascular reconstruction, temporary arterial shunting may be useful. Presently available shunts, however, are tubular and allow for distal perfusion to only one vessel. We have utilized a modified bifurcated hemodialysis catheter (Mahurkar MAXID; Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, Mass) to successfully provide simultaneous perfusion from the proximal common femoral artery to both the superficial and deep femoral vessels. Such catheters are readily available in most institutions, can be quickly modified, and are easy use in urgent trauma situations.",

    "abstract": "With the expansion of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair after the introduction of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), there is a concern that even with a lower operative mortality there could be an increasing number of aneurysm-related deaths. To evaluate this, we looked at national trends in AAA repair volume as well as mortality rates after intact and ruptured AAA repair encompassing the introduction of EVAR.\nPatients with intact or ruptured AAA undergoing open repair or EVAR and all those with a diagnosis of ruptured AAA were identified within the 1993 to 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnosis and procedure codes. The number of repairs, number of rupture diagnoses without repair, number of deaths, and associated mortality rates were measured for each year of the database. Outcomes (mean annual volumes) were compared from the pre-EVAR era (1993 to 1998) with the post-EVAR era (2001 to 2005).\nSince its introduction, EVAR increased steadily and accounted for 56% of repairs yet only 27% of the deaths for intact repairs in 2005. The mean annual number of intact repairs increased from 36,122 in the pre-EVAR era to 38,901 in the post-EVAR era, whereas the mean annual number of deaths related to intact AAA repair decreased from 1693 pre-EVAR to 1207 post-EVAR (P < .0001). Mortality for all intact AAA repair decreased from 4.0% to 3.1% (P < .0001) pre-EVAR and post-EVAR, but open repair mortality was unchanged (open repair, 4.7% to 4.5%, P = .31; EVAR, 1.3%). During the same time, the mean annual number of ruptured repairs decreased from 2804 to 1846, and deaths from ruptured AAA repairs decreased from 2804 to 1846 (P < .0001). Mortality for ruptured AAA repair decreased from 44.3% to 39.9% (P < .0001) pre-EVAR and post-EVAR (open repair, 44.3% to 39.9%, P < .001; EVAR, 32.4%). The overall mean annual number of ruptured AAA diagnoses (9979 to 7773, P < .0001) and overall mean annual deaths from a ruptured AAA decreased post-EVAR (5338 to 3901, P < .0001).\nSince the introduction of EVAR, the annual number of deaths from intact and ruptured AAA has significantly decreased. This coincided with an increase in intact AAA repair after the introduction of EVAR and a decrease in ruptured AAA diagnosis and repair volume.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective analysis of immediate outcomes following aneurysm rupture (rAAA) in two groups: patients previously treated at our center with primary endovascular repair (EVAR) and patients without previous EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in an 8-year period.\nFourteen patients with a confirmed rAAA identified throughout the follow-up period following primary EVAR repair at our center (from a population of 820 AAA treated at our center in election) were retrospectively compared with 155 patients without previous EVAR in the same time period, from the introduction of an intention-to-treat protocol with EVAR for rAAA in January 1999. Primary study outcomes included 30-day mortality and severe systemic complications following rAAA correction with both open and EVAR treatments.\nIn the 14 patients secondary interventions were necessary throughout follow-up prior to rupture in 43% (6/14). The mean time to rupture was 50.23 months (9-113). The mean increase in maximum aneurysmal diameter at rupture was 18.39 mm. Type of endoleaks observed at rupture: 35.7% I proximal, 35.7% III contralateral stump disconnection, 14.3% I distal, 14.3% III midgraft tear: treatment at rupture included five EVAR corrections with aortouniiliac endografts, four EVAR corrections with extensions, and five surgical conversions. Thirty-day mortality between the two groups, 28.5% (patients with prior EVAR) 38.7% (patients without prior EVAR), and severe systemic complications, 50% vs 37.6%, were not found to be statistically significant. Hemodynamic instability, 36% (patients with prior EVAR) 63% (patients without prior EVAR), was found to be an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (P < .0001), whereas severe systemic complications, 50% vs 33.5%, did not influence the same outcome (P = .852).\nIn terms of mortality, it would be logical to expect a protection from the endograft in patients with previous EVAR. A trend seems to confirm this assumption, but no statistical significance was found, which may be due to the small population size.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUS) in the detection of endoleaks in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who underwent endovascular repair (EVAR) compared with unenhanced ultrasound imaging. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was the gold standard. The secondary objective was to define the optimal dose of the second-generation contrast agent to routinely use in the CEUS examinations for endoleak detection.\nThe study enrolled 84 patients with unruptured AAA who were treated with EVAR and underwent CTA follow-up. In the same day, CTA (4- x 1-mm collimation, 1.25-mm slice width), unenhanced US imaging and CEUS imaging was performed in all patients. The CEUS studies were performed after an intravenous bolus injection of 1.2 mL and 2.4 mL of a second-generation contrast agent with continuous low-mechanical index (range, 0.01-0.04) real-time tissue harmonic imaging. The unenhanced US and CEUS studies were interpreted separately by two independent experienced readers to detect the presence of endoleaks by viewing recorded videotapes according to a five-point confidence scale. The standard of reference was represented by the consensus reading of CTA performed by two experienced radiologists not involved in the image analysis. Qualitative analysis as well as sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy in detecting endoleaks of each reading session were compared.\nCEUS imaging significantly improved the diagnostic performance of unenhanced US studies in the detection of endoleaks in terms of sensitivity (97.5% vs 62.5%), negative predictive value (97.3% vs 65.1%), accuracy (89.3% vs 63.1%), and specificity (81.8% vs 63.6%). The optimal dose of contrast agent to detect and characterize endoleaks was 2.4 mL. No adverse events were recorded during the study.\nThe results showed CEUS imaging is a fast, noninvasive, reliable, and valid alternative to multislice CTA for endoleak detection in endovascular aortic stent graft patients, and is superior to unenhanced US imaging. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging should be performed using a recommended contrast medium dose of 2.4 mL.",

Patients were a mean age of 54.6 years (range, 32-76 years). The clinical manifestation was C(4) in 10 limbs and C(5) in 18 limbs. Primary axial deep reflux was present in all 28 extremities, and axial superficial reflux was also present in 26. Duplex scanning and descending phlebography were used to estimate the functional condition of the deep vein valves. Fibrophleboscopy intraoperatively to study the anatomic status of the femoral vein valves and for checking the repaired valve function was used.\nPhleboscopy showed the following anatomy of ostial valves of the femoral vein: 16 valves had wide separation of cusps, 11 had elongation of cusps, and one had a monocusp. The competence of femoral vein ostial valves was completely restituted in all cases with wide separation of cusps. Multiple corrections were performed in cases with incomplete competence of the ostial valve (valve with elongation of cusps or monocusp).\nExternal valve support by the Vedensky Spiral is an effective and simple method of correction of incompetent femoral vein valves in limbs with primary deep venous reflux. The technical success of the intervention depends on the type of valve insufficiency and the correct choice of spiral diameter.",

    "abstract": "Patients with either renovascular hypertension (RVH) and/or renal insufficiency (RI) due to renal artery ostial occlusive disease (RAOOD) can successfully undergo an open surgical reconstruction procedure (OSRP), but since the publication of Blum et al(1) percutaneous balloon stent angioplasty (PTRA + stent) leaving a small part of the stent within the aorta has become very popular. However, balloon dilatation and stenting does not remove the atherosclerotic plaque, which is often heavily calcified but leads to disruption of the plaque causing myointimal hyperplasia and recurrent stenosis. Therefore, a comparison of the two treatment modalities concerning complications and durability in a prospective randomized design was felt to bring more insight to the discussion.\nFrom 1998 to 2004, we performed OSRP in 330 patients with RVH and/or RI for various locations of RAOOD. During this time period, 50 patients (female 18, male 32, mean age 64.4 years) with RAOOD of at least 70% stenosis (DSA and duplex criteria) in one or both renal arteries, who did not require other aorto/mesenteric/iliac reconstructive procedures agreed and were randomized to either OSRP (n = 25 patients, 49 arteries) or PTRA + stent (n = 25 patients, 28 arteries). Two patients crossed over to surgical treatment. Patients were followed on a regular basis for 4 years and longer. Endpoints were re-occurrence of RAOOD and impairment of either kidney function or RVH.\nWe approached 77 arteries. There was no early mortality in either group, but directly procedure-related morbidity was 13% in the interventional group and 4% in the surgical group. Four-year follow-up mortality was 18% in the interventional group and 25% in the surgical group. Both groups showed significant improvement of RVH (P < .001 in each group) as well as improvement or stabilization in patients with insufficient renal function. Freedom from recurrent RAOOD (>70%) was achieved in 90.1% of the surgical group and 79.9% of the interventional group.\nBoth treatment modalities showed good early results concerning RVH, kidney function, and renal perfusion. Despite a higher number of bilateral renal artery reconstructions in patients undergoing OSRP, which was probably due to the preferred technique of transaortic endarterectomy eliminating the plaque originating in the aorta and usually extending into both renal arteries, mortality was not higher and procedure-related morbidity was even lower compared to PTRA + stent. These findings and also longer durability of OSRP imply that surgical reconstruction remains the gold standard for patients with RAOOD before PTRA + stent may be considered.",

Ninety-six percent of target vessels remained patent during the study period and all occlusions occurred within the first year of follow-up. Five target vessels occluded (2 renal arteries [RAs] and 3 superior mesenteric arteries [SMAs]) without symptoms during follow-up and successful reinterventions were done on 2 stenosed RAs. Three patients suffered creatinine increase but none needed dialysis. One late aneurysm-related death occurred due to massive bleeding during redo surgery for infection.\nDespite complex anatomy or severe comorbidities in these patients f-EVAR has acceptable short- and midterm results in this series which includes a learning curve and offers a valid treatment alternative to patients unsuitable for standard EVAR or open repair.",

Three patients suffered creatinine increase but none needed dialysis. One late aneurysm-related death occurred due to massive bleeding during redo surgery for infection.",

    "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated a 70% incidence of microemboli on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) following carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of microemboli in two distinct time periods when procedural modifications were implemented into a CAS program.\nFollowing a retrospective quality review of our CAS cohort (n = 27) from November 2004 through April 2006 (period 1), we enrolled patients (n = 20) from May 2006 through February 2008 (period 2) undergoing CAS into a prospective cohort that included obtaining pre- and postprocedure DW-MRI exams. Procedural modifications during period 2 included the preferential use of closed-cell systems (60% vs 0% in period 1), early heparinization at the initiation of arterial access, and elimination of an arch angiogram. The hospital records of these 47 patients were reviewed; symptoms, comorbidities, lesion characteristics, periprocedural information, and postoperative outcomes were collected. The incidence and location of acute, postprocedural microemboli were determined using DW-MRIs.\nTwenty (74%) CAS patients from period 1 and seven (35%) patients from period 2 demonstrated acute microemboli on postprocedural DW-MRI (P = .02). The mean number of microemboli in period 1 was 4.1 +/- 5.3 vs 1.5 +/- 2.7 during period 2 (P = .04). Two of the 27 patients (7.4%) during period 1 experienced temporary neurologic changes that resolved within 36 hours. None of the patients during period 2 exhibited any neurologic changes. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms were similar between the two groups except for smoking prevalence, female presence, and obesity (BMI > 30). Period 2 patients when compared with period 1 had more technically challenging anatomy with more calcified lesions (68% vs 27%), longer lesions (15.9 mm vs 8.2 mm), and higher incidence of ulceration (55% vs 27%) (all P < .04).\nDespite successful performance of 47 consecutive CAS procedures without permanent neurologic sequelae, significant reductions in periprocedural embolic events as identified via DW-MRI lesions may be achieved through implementation of quality improvement measures identified through continuous outcome analysis. The long-term neurologic benefits associated with reduced subclinical neurologic events remains to be determined.",

Patients were evaluated with duplex ultrasound scans. In patients with enlarged veins along the SN, the anatomy of the incompetent veins, their size and association with superficial varicosities, and the severity of insufficiency were analyzed. The symptoms associated with their presence and the treatment results were also noted. Patients were re-evaluated following treatment for recurrence of varicosities and symptoms.\nWe identified 24 limbs in 21 patients with varicosities along the SN and its branches. The duration of signs and symptoms was 4.5 years ranging from 1 to 14. Reflux was detected in 18 veins of the SN, in three persistent sciatic veins and in three veins of the tibial nerve. All limbs with sciatic and tibial nerve veins had varicosities in the lateral and posterior aspect of thigh and calf and were symptomatic. Ten limbs presented with CEAP class 2, 5 with class 3, 2 with class 4, and 1 with class 1. Pain or tingling was reported in 15 limbs, itching in 8, and heaviness in 7. The distribution of pain and tingling was present along the nerves in 19 limbs. One patient had acute thrombosis in a persistent sciatic vein and died from pulmonary embolism. Of the 21 limbs with SN veins, 16 were treated with subfascial vein ligation and phlebectomies. Three patients had sclerotherapy, 1 refused treatment, and 1 had mild symptoms not requiring treatment. Of the 19 treated limbs, in 11 there was relief of their symptoms, 6 had significant improvement, and 2 had no change. Within a year, 4 patients required additional treatment for veins along the same area. Eleven limbs had a follow-up duplex scan 3 to 19 months after their treatment. All limbs showed significant diameter reduction in the nerve veins while mild reflux was present in 3 (4.1 mm vs 2.1 mm, P < .001).\nReflux is the most common pathology of the sciatic and tibial nerve veins which produces significant symptoms along the distribution of the nerves. Treatment of the varicosities offers significant relief while recurrence or residual varicosities are easily managed.",

    "abstract": "May-Thurner syndrome is characterized by left common iliac obstruction secondary to compression of the left iliac vein by the right common iliac artery against the fifth-lumbar vertebra. This anatomic variant results in an increased incidence of left-sided deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Furthermore, while a preponderance of left-sided DVT has been demonstrated in women during pregnancy and oral contraceptive use, patients are not typically screened for this condition after developing a left-sided DVT. As anticoagulation alone is ineffective for DVT treatment in the setting of May-Thurner anatomy, more aggressive treatment is warranted. Failure to diagnosis this condition predisposes these women to the unnecessary risks of recurrent DVT and post-thrombotic syndrome.\nWe present the occurrence of 7 adolescent patients with previously undiagnosed May-Thurner syndrome who presented with DVT after the initiation of oral contraceptive steroids (OCP) use. All 7 patients elected to proceed with mechanical thrombolysis/catheter based thrombolysis followed by endovascular stenting and were postoperatively treated with 6 months of warfarin.\nMean patient age was 18.3 +/- 3.3 years (range, 16-24 years). Mean time to presentation after initiation of OCP was 5 weeks (range, 2-10 weeks). Mean time to intervention was 16.8 days (range, 10-24 days). All patients were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Our rate of intraoperative clot resolution was 100%. All 7 patients were treated with self expanding nitinol stents after angioplasty of the iliac vein stenosis with resolution of the stenotic segment. Primary stent patency is 100% (7/7). Mean follow-up time is 13 +/- 13.84 months (range, 6-42 months). There have been no long-term complications related to surgical treatment or anticoagulation. All 7 patients have experienced resolution of left leg swelling and pain and have no evidence of post-thrombotic syndrome or DVT recurrence to date.\nWomen on OCPs presenting with left-sided iliofemoral DVT should be screened for hypercoagulable disorders and underlying May-Thurner anatomy. Treatment of May-Thurner syndrome should include thrombolysis/thrombectomy and anticoagulation for current DVT in addition to angioplasty and stenting of the underlying obstruction.",

    "abstract": "The frequency of late removal of endovascular abdominal aortic repair (EVAR) parallels the rise of endovascular aortic repair. Evaluation of outcomes for EVAR explants may identify risks for complications and alter clinical management.\nA patient database was used to identify EVAR patients requiring explant >1 month after implant. A retrospective analysis was conducted of the type of graft, duration of implant, reason for removal, operative technique, death, and length of stay.\nDuring 1999 through 2007, 1606 EVARs were performed, and 25 patients required explantation, with an additional 16 referred from other institutions (N = 41). The average age was 73 years (range, 50-87 years); 90% were men. Grafts were excised after a median of 33.3 months (range, 3-93 months). Explanted grafts included 16 AneuRx (40%), 7 Ancure (17%), 6 Excluder (15%), 4 Zenith (10%), 4 Talent (10%), 1 Cook Aortomonoiliac rupture graft, 1 Endologix, 1 Quantum LP, and 1 homemade tube graft. Overall hospital mortality was 19% and occurred after conversion for rupture in 4, and in infected graft, aortoenteric fistula, repair of new aneurysm of the visceral segment, and claudication due to graft stenosis in one patient each. Elective EVAR-related mortality was 3.3%. Mortality was higher in patients with rupture compared with nonrupture (4 of 6 vs 3 of 35, P <or= .01). Thirty patients (73%) had one or more endoleaks (type I, 16; II, 9; III, 9; endotension, 5). Migration (n = 10), rupture (n = 6), aortoenteric fistula (n = 3), infection (n = 1), limb thrombosis (n = 3), and claudication (n =1) were also factors. Proximal aortic control was above the endograft (supravisceral, 23; suprarenal, 12; infrarenal, 6). Reconstruction was an aortoiliac repair in 63% and tube graft in 25%. Grafts with suprarenal fixation required longer proximal aortic clamp time of 43 minutes vs 28 minutes for infrarenal fixation. Complete graft removal was achieved in 85%. Proximal or distal portions of the endograft were incorporated into the repair in the remaining six.\nElective EVAR conversion, although technically challenging may be done with mortality similar to primary open repair. Mortality for conversion for infected grafts and ruptured aneurysms remains high. EVAR is associated with continued risk of conversion, and surveillance may identify late complications that require removal, justifying lifelong monitoring. Aggressive management of late complications and elective conversion may minimize the mortality associated with this procedure.",

Overall hospital mortality was 19% and occurred after conversion for rupture in 4, and in infected graft, aortoenteric fistula, repair of new aneurysm of the visceral segment, and claudication due to graft stenosis in one patient each. Elective EVAR-related mortality was 3.3%. Mortality was higher in patients with rupture compared with nonrupture (4 of 6 vs 3 of 35, P <or= .01). Thirty patients (73%) had one or more endoleaks (type I, 16; II, 9; III, 9; endotension, 5). Migration (n = 10), rupture (n = 6), aortoenteric fistula (n = 3), infection (n = 1), limb thrombosis (n = 3), and claudication (n =1) were also factors. Proximal aortic control was above the endograft (supravisceral, 23; suprarenal, 12; infrarenal, 6). Reconstruction was an aortoiliac repair in 63% and tube graft in 25%. Grafts with suprarenal fixation required longer proximal aortic clamp time of 43 minutes vs 28 minutes for infrarenal fixation. Complete graft removal was achieved in 85%. Proximal or distal portions of the endograft were incorporated into the repair in the remaining six.",

    "abstract": "Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is a critical clinical condition, which may present with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, with or without signs of sepsis. Conventional open surgical repair is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Endovascular stent graft repair has been attempted, but recurrent infection remains of major concern. We conducted a systematic review to assess potential factors associated with poor outcome after endovascular treatment.\nThe English literature was searched using the MEDLINE electronic database up to April 2008. All studies reporting on the primary management of primary or secondary AEF with endovascular stent graft repair were considered.\nData were extracted from 33 reports that included 41 patients and were entered in the final analysis. Persistent/recurrent/new infection or recurrent hemorrhage developed in 44% of the patients, after a mean follow-up period of 13 months (range, 0.13-36). Secondary, as compared to primary, AEF had an almost threefold increased risk of persistent/recurrent infection. Evidence of sepsis preoperatively was found to be a factor indicating unfavorable outcome (P < .05). Persistent/recurrent/new infection after treatment was associated with worse 30-day and overall survival compared with those who did not develop sepsis (P < .05).\nEndovascular stent graft repair of AEF was associated with a high incidence of infection or recurrent bleeding postoperatively. Evidence of sepsis preoperatively was indicating poor outcome.",

    "abstract": "Platelet activation and thrombus renewal are keys to intraluminal thrombus formation and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). This study explored the ability of AZD6140, a P2Y(12) receptor antagonist, to inhibit platelet activation and prevent aneurysm development in a rat experimental model of AAA.\nAortic aneurysms were induced by implanting a segment of sodium dodecyl sulfate-decellularized guinea pig aorta in rat aortas. One day later, rats were randomized to AZD6140 (10 mg/kg twice daily by mouth) or diluent (n = 23 per group) for either 10 (n = 18) or 42 days (n = 28). Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-mediated platelet aggregation, aneurysm expansion, intraluminal thrombus formation, inflammatory infiltration, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, and smooth muscle cell colonization were measured.\nAZD6140 inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vivo for 12 hours, justifying twice-daily administration in rats. The spontaneous increase in aortic diameter shown in the aneurysmal model (2.22 +/- 0.56 mm at day 10 vs 5.21 +/- 1.22 mm at day 42) was reduced with AZD6140 (3.61 +/- 1.46 mm at day 42, P < .01). This beneficial effect was associated with a significant reduction of thrombus development, platelet CD41 expression (P < .05), and leukocyte infiltration of the mural thrombus at days 10 and 42 (P < .01). MMP-9 expression correlated with mural thrombus area and was significantly reduced by AZD6140 (P < .05). AZD6140 limited elastic fiber degradation (P < .05) and enhanced progressive colonization of the thrombus by smooth muscle cells at day 42 (P < .01).\nThese data suggest that inhibition of platelet activation limits intraluminal thrombus biologic activities, thereby impairing aneurysm development.",

Women are also under-represented in many surgical disciplines. The purpose of this study was to assess trends in the proportion of women, blacks, and Hispanics admitted to vascular surgery (VS) and related specialties, and to compare them with each other and with a surgical specialty, orthopedic surgery (OS), with a formal diversity initiative.\nData on the fellowship pool of VS, interventional radiology (IR), and interventional cardiology (IC), as well as the resident pools of general surgery (GS) and orthopedic surgery (OS), were obtained from U.S. graduate medical education reports for 1999 through 2005. Cochrane-Armitage trend tests were used to assess trends in the proportion of females, blacks, and Hispanics in relation to the total physician workforce for each subspecialty.\nNo significant trends in the proportion of females, blacks, or Hispanics accepted into VS and IC fellowship programs occurred during the study period. In contrast, IR, GS, and OS programs revealed significant trends for increasing proportions of at least one of the underrepresented study groups. In particular, OS, which has implemented a diversity awareness program, showed a positive trend in female and Hispanic trainees (P < .04 and P < .02, respectively). Blacks showed a significant increasing trend only in IR (P = .05). Conversely, a positive trend toward continued growth in the Hispanic group was seen in GS (P < .001), IR, and OS (P = .04 and P = .02, respectively).\nThe racial/ethnic and gender composition of the physician trainee pool in vascular specialties, particularly VS, has not matched the increasing growth of underrepresented groups in the US population of patients with vascular disease. Formal programs to recruit qualified women and minorities appear successful in increasing workforce diversity.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports have suggested that angioplasty, with and without stenting (PTA/S), may have a lower perioperative mortality rate than open surgery for revascularization of acute (AMI) and chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). It is unclear if there has been nationwide adoption of this methodology or whether there is actually a mortality benefit.\nWe identified all patients undergoing surgical (bypass, endarterectomy, or embolectomy) or PTA/S mesenteric revascularization from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988 to 2006. A diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revisioncoding of AMI or CMI was required for inclusion. We evaluated trends in management during this period and compared in-hospital death and complications between surgical bypass and PTA/S for the years 2000 to 2006.\nFrom 1988 to 2006, there were 6342 PTA/S and 16,071 open surgical repairs overall. PTA/S increased steadily, surpassing all surgery for CMI in 2002. PTA/S for AMI has also increased and surpassed bypass in 2002 but has not surpassed all surgical procedures for AMI even in 2006. The mortality rate was lower after PTA/S than after bypass for CMI (3.7% vs 13%, P < .01) and AMI (16% vs 28%, P < .01). Bowel resection was more common after bypass than PTA/S for CMI (7% vs 3%, P < .01). This subgroup showed an increased in-hospital mortality rate for both repair types (54% and 25%, respectively).\nPTA/S is being used with increasing frequency for revascularization of CMI and AMI. The lower in-hospital mortality rate for patients, as they are currently being selected, shows that PTA/S is appropriate therapy for selected patients with CMI. Longitudinal data are needed to determine the durability of this benefit. The greater proportion of patients undergoing bowel resection with bypass for AMI suggests a more advanced level of ischemia in this group, making comparison with PTA/S difficult. However, PTA/S may be useful in selected patients with AMI and appropriate anatomy. Further data with greater detail regarding symptomatology and anatomy will clarify appropriate patient selection.",

Longitudinal data are needed to determine the durability of this benefit. The greater proportion of patients undergoing bowel resection with bypass for AMI suggests a more advanced level of ischemia in this group, making comparison with PTA/S difficult. However, PTA/S may be useful in selected patients with AMI and appropriate anatomy. Further data with greater detail regarding symptomatology and anatomy will clarify appropriate patient selection.",

PTA/S for AMI has also increased and surpassed bypass in 2002 but has not surpassed all surgical procedures for AMI even in 2006. The mortality rate was lower after PTA/S than after bypass for CMI (3.7% vs 13%, P < .01) and AMI (16% vs 28%, P < .01). Bowel resection was more common after bypass than PTA/S for CMI (7% vs 3%, P < .01). This subgroup showed an increased in-hospital mortality rate for both repair types (54% and 25%, respectively).",

Six recently published population-based studies from the United States demonstrated low mortality rates associated with EVAR; however, only a small proportion of ruptured AAAs were treated by EVAR. Systematic reviews and population-based studies both raised concerns about patient selection and publication bias. Two randomized trials are in progress, and one is due to commence 2009.\nThe outcome of EVAR in a nonselected patient population remains unknown. One or more definitive randomized trials could provide the level I evidence to resolve these issues.",

In rare cases of DIC caused by aneurysms, operative repair has been curative. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been established as an effective treatment. We report a 73-year-old man in whom severe bleeding developed from groin incisions and cannulae sites immediately after EVAR. An intraoperative angiogram showed a type I endoleak, but the procedure had to be abandoned due to continued bleeding. Blood tests confirmed a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation that persisted chronically 3 months postoperatively. Attempts to repair the endoleak with stenting were unsuccessful, resulting in persistence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. This resolved after successful treatment of the endoleak with aortic banding.",

    "abstract": "We developed a novel method using anatomic markers along the thoracic aorta to accurately quantify longitudinal and circumferential cyclic strain in nondiseased thoracic aortas during the cardiac cycle and to compute age-related changes of the human thoracic aorta.\nChanges in thoracic aorta cyclic strains were quantified using cardiac-gated computed tomography image data of 14 patients (aged 35 to 80 years) with no visible aortic pathology (aneurysms or dissection). We measured the diameter and circumferential cyclic strain in the arch and descending thoracic aorta (DTA), the longitudinal cyclic strain along the DTA, and changes in arch length and motion of the ascending aorta relative to the DTA. Diameters were computed distal to the left coronary artery, proximal and distal to the brachiocephalic trunk, and distal to the left common carotid, left subclavian, and the first and seventh intercostal arteries. Cyclic strains were computed using the Green-Lagrange strain tensor. Arch length was defined along the vessel centerline from the left coronary artery to the first intercostal artery. The length of the DTA was defined along the vessel centerline from the first to seventh intercostal artery. Longitudinal cyclic strain was quantified as the difference between the systolic and diastolic DTA lengths divided by the diastolic DTA length. Comparisons were made between seven younger (age, 41 +/- 7 years; 5 men) and seven older (age, 68 +/- 6 years; 5 men) patients.\nThe average increase of diameters of the thoracic aorta was 14% with age from the younger to the older (mean age, 41 vs 68 years) group. The average circumferential cyclic strain of the thoracic aorta decreased by 55% with age from the younger to the older group. The longitudinal cyclic strain decreased with age by 50% from the younger to older group (2.0% +/- 0.4% vs 1.0% +/- 1%, P = .03). The arch length increased by 14% with age from the younger to the older group (134 +/- 17 mm vs 152 +/- 10 mm, P = .03).\nThe thoracic aorta enlarges circumferentially and axially and deforms significantly less in the circumferential and longitudinal directions with increasing age. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative description of in vivo longitudinal cyclic strain and length changes for the human thoracic aorta, creating a foundation for standards in reporting data related to in vivo deformation and may have significant implications in endoaortic device design, testing, and stability.",

    "abstract": "Elevated inflammatory cytokine levels have been implicated in the pathogenesis of non-healing chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) ulcers. The goal of this study was to determine the protein levels of a wide range of inflammatory cytokines in untreated CVI ulcer tissue before and after 4 weeks of high-strength compression therapy. These levels were compared to cytokines present in healthy tissue.\nThirty limbs with untreated CVI and leg ulceration received therapy for 4 weeks with sustained high-compression bandaging at an ambulatory wound center. Biopsies were obtained from healthy and ulcerated tissue before and after therapy. A multiplexed protein assay was used to measure multiple cytokines in a single sample. Patients were designated as rapid or delayed healers based on ulcer surface area change.\nThe majority of pro-inflammatory cytokine protein levels were elevated in ulcer tissue compared to healthy tissue, and compression therapy significantly reduced these cytokines. TGF-beta1 was upregulated in ulcer tissue following compression therapy. Rapid healing ulcers had significantly higher levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, IL-12p40, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) before compression therapy, and IL-1 Ra after therapy. IFN-gamma levels significantly decreased following therapy in the rapidly healing patients.\nCVI ulcer healing is associated with a pro-inflammatory environment prior to treatment that reflects metabolically active peri-wound tissue that has the potential to heal. Treatment with compression therapy results in healing that is coupled with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 Ra.",

    "abstract": "Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BAI) remains a leading cause of trauma deaths, and off-label use of endovascular devices has been increasingly utilized in an effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality in this population. Utilizing a nationwide database, we determined the incidence of BAI, and analyzed both functional and survival outcomes at discharge compared with matched controls.\nPatients with BAI were identified by International Classification of Disease-9 codes from the National Trauma Data Bank (Version 6.2), 2000-2005. Patients were analyzed based on aortic repair, associated physiologic burden, and coexisting injuries. Control groups were matched by age, mechanism, major thoracic Abbreviated Injury Scale score (AIS >/= 3), major head AIS, and major abdominal AIS. Outcomes were assessed using the functional independence measure (FIM) score and overall mortality. FIM scores were scored from 1 (full assistance required) to 4 (fully independent) for three categories: feeding, locomotion, and expression.\nDuring the study period, 3,114 patients with BAI were identified among 1.1 million trauma admissions for an overall incidence of 0.3%. One hundred thirteen (4%) were dead on arrival, and 599 (19%) died during triage. Of the patients surviving transport and triage (n = 2402), 29% had a concomitant major abdominal injury and 31% had a major head injury. Sixty-eight percent (1,642) underwent no repair, 28% (665) open aortic repair, and 4% (95) endovascular repair with associated mortality rates of 65%, 19%, and 18%, respectively (P < .05). Aortic repair independently improved survival when controlling for associated injuries and physiologic burden (odds ratio (OR) = 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24-0.54, P < .05). Compared with matched controls, BAI resulted in a higher mortality (55% vs. 15%, P < .05), and independently contributed to mortality (OR = 4.04; 95% CI, 3.53-4.63, P < .05). In addition, BAI patients were less likely to be fully independent for feeding (72% vs. 82%, P < .05), locomotion (33% vs. 55%, P < .05), and expression (80% vs 88%, P < .05).\nThis manuscript is the first to define the incidence of BAI utilizing the NTDB. Remarkably, two-thirds of patients are unable to undergo attempts at aortic repair, which portends a poor prognosis. When controlling for associated injuries, blunt aortic injury independently impacts survival and results in poor function in those surviving to discharge.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous laser treatment is a minimally invasive technique for ablation of the incompetent great (GSV) and small saphenous vein (SSV). Compared with the GSV, fewer data are available on SSV laser ablation and are not validated. This multicenter prospective study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of endovenous laser ablation to treat SSVs.\nBetween January 2003 and January 2007, 204 patients (229 limbs) with CVD and incompetent SSVs (evaluated by the CEAP classification) who were eligible for surgery underwent consecutive laser ablation procedures. Many required additional treatment for varicose tributaries and perforator veins with phlebectomy and foam sclerotherapy, Energy was delivered to the vein wall by a 600-microm optical fiber using 810-nm or 980-nm diode laser. Ablations were performed with duplex ultrasound (DU) guidance and tumescent anesthesia. Follow-up was with clinical examination and DU imaging.\nDU imaging showed immediate occlusion of the SSV with no thrombosis in the proximal veins. No complications occurred intraoperatively. All patients had postoperative ecchymosis, but it was minimal. Three patients had distal thrombotic complications. Superficial phlebitis after complementary surgery occurred in three cases. Complete occlusion with absence of flow </=2 months of follow-up was detected in 226 SSV (98.7%). It occurred 22 in patients with large SSV diameter. Recanalization was found in one patient at 12 months and in two patients at 24 months. Seven limbs had reflux in previously treated areas, treated segments, and segments in continuity with them. Three underwent an intervention to correct symptomatic reflux. The other four had no symptoms. After 1 year, eight limbs developed reflux in new locations and four underwent treatment. Symptoms resolved in most patients soon after the operation. The mean follow-up was 16 months (range, 2-39 months). After 8 to 12 months postprocedurally, the laser-treated veins were fibrotic and almost indistinguishable on DU imaging from the surrounding tissues. In five patients (2.25%) postoperative paresthesia occurred >2 to 3 days postoperatively and persisted in the follow-up. No paresthesia occurred in our last series whenever a larger amount of tumescent cold saline was infused around the vein.\nEndovenous laser ablation of the SSV has excellent early and midterm results. The prevalence of thrombosis and paresthesia is very low. Symptom relief is very good.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is a generally safe, cost-effective, and practical technique for the treatment of certain venous malformations; however, not all vascular malformation lesions are amenable to the ultrasound-guided method. Venous outflow of the sclerosing agent and extravasation are difficult to check when only ultrasound guidance is used. This study describes a new fluoroscopy-guided technique that uses standardized sclerosing foam for peripheral venous malformations. The short-term efficacy and safety of fluoroscopy-guided foam sclerotherapy for peripheral venous malformations was evaluated.\nA retrospective review of a prospectively collected data was performed for 23 patients (9 males, 14 females) with limited (localized) venous malformations treated with foam sclerotherapy who were referred from January 2007 to December 2007. Median patient age was 21 years (range, 5 months-39 years). Lesion locations included extremities in 13, faces in eight, and trunks in two. The standardized sclerosing foam was prepared using Tessari's method to mix room air with 5% sodium morrhuate in a 4:1 ratio. Sclerotherapy was performed by the \"filling-defects\" technique under fluoroscopy. Postsclerotherapy surveillance was done at 6 months after the last session. Treatment response was assessed clinically and by means of lesion size measurement with magnetic resonance imaging. During the treatment and the follow-up period, adverse events and adverse drug reactions were recorded. Specific complications were classified as major or minor.\nA total of 58 treatment sessions were performed (mean, 3 sessions per patient; range, 1-6 sessions). At the 6-month follow-up, 15 patients (65.2%) showed a total disappearance of treated malformations, six (26.1%) showed a reduction in malformation size of >50%, and two (8.7%) showed a reduction in malformation size of </=50%. The overall patient-reported outcome was excellent in 11 (47.8%), good in 8 (34.8%), or moderate in 4 (17.4%). Minor complications included swelling and inflammatory reaction per session, mild pain in 17 sessions (29.3%), and skin blister at the injection site in two sessions (3.4%), which resolved spontaneously within several days to 2 weeks. No major complications occurred.\nFluoroscopic guidance could have great promise in foam sclerotherapy of peripheral venous malformations, although larger studies are necessary to determine the advantages of this technique over other sclerotherapeutic methods.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular procedures are increasingly used in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Whether this new procedural approach translates to clinical outcomes equivalent or superior to open surgical revascularization is a subject of debate. We sought to analyze population-based rates of major amputations for PAD during a time period in which the use of endovascular surgical procedures increased dramatically.\nWe used the 1996-2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) to analyze rates of amputations and vascular interventions, and also to characterize the treatment of patients admitted acutely for PAD. Vascular interventions were designated based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes as open bypass, endovascular intervention, or major amputation (disarticulation at ankle or higher amputation). Population-based age-adjusted incidence rates of treatment were calculated by combining procedure rates with census data.\nOur analysis included 97,000 acute admissions for PAD, 83,000 major amputations, 77,500 endovascular procedures, and 171,000 open vascular bypass operations. Between 1996 and 2005, population-based rates of acute admissions for PAD decreased by 4.3% per year, open procedures by 6.6% per year, and major amputations by 6.4% per year, whereas endovascular procedures increased by 4.8% per year. Of patients acutely admitted for PAD, the likelihood of undergoing an amputation decreased (30.2% to 21.8%), the likelihood of undergoing an open vascular procedure decreased (34.5% to 26.3%), and the likelihood of undergoing an endovascular operation increased (12.7% to 28.3%). All of these changes were statistically significant at P < .05.\nThe last decade has seen a significant increase in the use of endovascular procedures and a decrease in rates of major amputation. These trends are seen both for patients admitted with acute PAD, as well as in the population in general. While our study was not designed to demonstrate a causal relationship, our findings suggest an association between increased application of endovascular technology and reduced rates of amputation in patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the surgical and neurological outcome of patients undergoing simultaneous repair of aortic arch and descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (DTAA) or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) via left thoracotomy or thoracolaparotomy.\nDuring a 6-year period, we performed 32 procedures in 23 male and 9 female patients with DTAA or TAAA with concomitant aortic arch aneurysms. The mean age of the patients was 50.9 years (range, 18-75 years). Twenty-two patients suffered from DTAA, 4 had type-I TAAA, and 6 had type-II TAAA. The entire aortic arch was involved in 12 patients and the distal hemi-arch in 20 patients. The mean diameter of the aneurysms was 6 cm (range, 4.9-7.6 cm). All patients were operated on according to the protocol with cerebrospinal fluid drainage, distal aortic and selective organ perfusion, as well as antegrade brain perfusion. Neuromonitoring was performed by means of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), transcranial Doppler (TCD), and electroencephalography (EEG).\nAll patients survived the surgical procedure and 30-day mortality did not occur. At the end of the procedure, all patients had adequate MEPs, TCD, and EEG. One patient died 47 days after operation due to gastrointestinal bleeding and therapy-resistant coagulopathy. Major postoperative complications like paraplegia or paraparesis, renal failure, and myocardial infarction were not encountered. One patient had a stroke but neurological deficits were irrelevant. Mean preoperative creatinine level was 125 mmol/L, which peaked to a mean maximal level of 130 and returned to 92 mmol/L at discharge. Other complications included bleeding requiring surgical intervention (n = 4), arrhythmia (n = 1), pneumonia (n = 5), and respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2). At a median follow-up of 38 months, all but 1 patient was alive and free of re-intervention.\nSingle-stage repair of aortic arch and concomitant thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms via left-sided thoracotomy or thoraco-laparotomy yields excellent short- and midterm outcomes. Monitoring of cerebral and spinal cord function contributes to improved neurologic outcome.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed if emergency endovascular repair (eEVR) reduces the increase in intra-abdominal compartment pressure and host inflammatory response in patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nThirty patients with ruptured AAA were prospectively recruited. Patients were offered eEVR or emergency conventional open repair (eOR) depending on anatomic suitability. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured postoperatively, at 2 and 6 hours, and then daily for 5 days. Organ dysfunction was assessed preoperatively by calculating the Hardman score. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and lung injury scores were calculated regularly postoperatively. Hematologic analyses included serum urea and electrolytes, liver function indices, and C-reactive protein. Urine was analyzed for the albumin-creatinine ratio.\nFourteen patients (12 men; mean age, 72.2 +/- 6.2 years) underwent eEVR, and 16 (14 men; mean age, 71.4 +/- 7.0 years) had eOR. Intra-abdominal pressure was significantly higher in the eOR cohort compared with the eEVR group. The eEVR patients had significantly less blood loss (P < .001) and transfused (P < .001) and total intraoperative intravenous fluid infusion (P = .001). The eOR group demonstrated a greater risk of organ dysfunction, with a higher systemic inflammatory response syndrome score at day 5 (P = .005) and higher lung injury scores at days 1 and 3 (P = .02 and P = .02) compared with eEVR. A significant correlation was observed between intra-abdominal pressure and the volume of blood lost and transfused, amount of fluid given, systemic inflammatory response syndrome score, multiple organ dysfunction score, lung injury score, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital.\nThese results suggest that eEVR of ruptured AAA is less stressful and is associated with less intra-abdominal hypertension and host inflammatory response compared with eOR.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the durability of a single model of aortic endograft in an unselected population with core lab analysis of morphological changes.\nComputed tomography (CT) images of patients treated with Talent Unidoc (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) endografts from 2002 to 2006 in nine European centers with more than 1 year follow-up were centrally reviewed using a dedicated software with multiplanar and volume reconstructions. Images were checked for aneurysm growth >/=5 mm, neck enlargement >3 mm, graft migration >/=10 mm, endoleak, structural integrity. Morphological changes were defined clinically relevant when associated with reintervention or aneurysm-related death.\nA total of 349 patients (mean age 73.8 years, 90% males) were available for analysis; 1187 CT examinations were reviewed. Median abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter was 56 mm (interquartile range [IQR] 49-62), neck length 20 mm (IQR 16-30), and neck diameter 25 mm (IQR 23-26). Mean follow-up was 25 months (range 12-60 months). During the study period, 10 late deaths (1 aneurysm-related, 0.3%) with a survival rate of 89.2% at 48 months and 33 reinterventions including 8 conversions (2.2%), 2 AAA ruptures (0.6%) and 1 (0.3%) loss of graft integrity were recorded. Cumulative reintervention rate was 6%, 8%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. According to core lab analysis, 22 AAA grew, 169 were unchanged, and 158 shrunk, with a growing AAA rate of 3.1% patients/year. Five growths required reintervention, one for rupture. Forty-seven (6.5% patients/year) neck enlargements, three clinically relevant, 17 migrations (2.4% patients/year), five clinically relevant, and 70 endoleaks (9.7 % patients/year), 11 clinically relevant, were detected.\nData from this real world experience monitored with a centralized imaging review show that endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with the latest generation of a single model of endograft is associated with low graft thrombosis and graft fatigue, and low late aneurysm rupture and related death risks.

The Aptus endograft is a three-piece modular device with a flexible unsupported main body and two fully supported limbs in a 5.3 mm outer diameter (OD) (16F) delivery system for all iliac limbs and two of three main body sizes. The largest main body (29 mm diameter) is in a 6 mm (18 F OD) delivery system. EndoStaples measuring 4 mm (length) by 3 mm (diameter) designed to provide transmural graft fixation to the adventitia are applied independent of the endograft delivery system. Inclusion criteria included a proximal aortic neck length of 12 mm and iliac landing zone of 10 mm. Secondary endpoints included freedom from endoleaks, rupture, migration, and device integrity.\nTwenty-one (21) patients were enrolled at five centers. All patients received the Aptus Endograft and EndoStaples. Ninety-six EndoStaples (range, 2-10; median, 4) were implanted. All patients (n = 21) completed 1-month and 6-month follow-up evaluation and 14 completed 1-year follow-up. Two proximal cuffs and one limb extension were used as adjunctive endograft components at implantation. Three secondary interventions were performed in 2 patients for limb thrombosis. There were no EndoStaple-related adverse events, device integrity failures, migrations, or conversions.\nThese results of the STAPLE-1 trial document the acute safety and feasibility of the Aptus Endograft and EndoStaples. Early follow-up demonstrates excellent 6-month and 1-year results. A pivotal phase II trial is underway at 25 US centers.",

CT scans were obtained selectively-based on suspicious findings of a new endoleak or enlarging sac on CDU. The records of all patients with at least 1 year FU under this schedule were reviewed.\nOne hundred eighty-four patients were followed with CDU only for 1 to 4 years for a mean of 24 +/- 13 months. The new schedule was initiated at a mean of 34 +/- 24 months after EVAR (range 1-112 months). Twenty-three patients had previous endoleaks that had resolved spontaneously or had been treated. During CDU FU, three new endoleaks were detected, one with sac enlargement. All prompted CT evaluation: one type II endoleak with stable sac size could not be identified on CT 3 months later, and two distal type I endoleaks that required limb extension. All three had a prior Ancure endograft. No ruptures or graft occlusions were noted. One abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) related death followed graft explantation for infection. There were two additional deaths from malignancy and two from cardiac causes. After the FU switch, freedom from endoleaks was 96%, and from secondary interventions 95% at 48 months by life table method. Mean AAA diameter at baseline was 54 +/- 8 mm and decreased to 40 +/- 11 mm before the switch to CDU only FU. At last FU mean aneurysm diameter was 39 +/- 11 mm. When the current switch criteria were applied to a consecutive series of 200 EVAR patients, 97% would have been eligible for CDU only surveillance by 3 years postoperatively.\nCDU only surveillance post-EVAR is safe and can be initiated early after treatment in patients with shrinking or stable aneurysms. This policy should result in cost savings advantage and avoid the complications associated with CT.",

    "abstract": "Benefit of prophylactic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair requires sufficient survival to overcome operative risk. Since death within 1 year of elective open or endovascular (EVAR) infrarenal AAA repair likely indicates ineffective treatment, we developed a prediction model for 1-year mortality to aid clinical decision-making.\nWe used a prospective registry of 1387 consecutive patients who had undergone elective AAA repair from 2003 to 2007 by 50 surgeons from 11 hospitals in Northern New England. Cox proportional hazards were used to analyze potential risk factors for 1-year mortality, including medical comorbidities, aortic clamp site, preoperative risk factor modification (eg, beta-blockade), and aneurysm diameter.\nThirty-day and 1-year mortality after open repair (n = 748) was 2.3% and 5.8%, and after EVAR (n = 639) was 0.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Factors associated with death within 1-year after open repair were: age >/= 70 (P = .007; hazard ratio [HR] 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-6.3), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P < .0001; HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9-7.0), chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine >/= 1.8) (P = .008; HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.2) and suprarenal aortic clamp site (P < .0001; HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.9-7.5). Depending on the number of risk factors present, predicted 1-year mortality after open repair varied from 1% in patients with no risk factors to 67% in patients with four risk factors. Our model demonstrated excellent correlation between observed and expected deaths (r = 0.97). For EVAR, identified risk factors for death within 1 year included a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) (P = .002; HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.5), and aneurysm diameter >/=6.5 cm (P = .04 95% CI 1.0-4.8). Depending on the number of risk factors present, predicted mortality ranged from 3.6% to 23%. A model using CHF and aneurysm diameter correlated well with actual mortality rates, with an observed to expected ratio of 0.96.\nPredictors of 1-year mortality can identify patients less likely to benefit from elective AAA repair. These factors differ for open repair vs EVAR and should be considered in individual patient decision-making. Our EVAR model had less impact on 1-year survival, even if CHF and large AAA diameter were present. However, a combination of age, COPD, renal insufficiency, and need for suprarenal clamping have significant impact on 1-year mortality after open AAA repair. Consideration of these variables should assist decision-making for elective AAA repair, especially in borderline cases.",

    "abstract": "Infolding of an aortic endograft, usually characterized as endograft collapse, is a quite rare complication reported to occur mainly in thoracic aortic grafts. This report presents a case of an early proximal collapse of an endoprosthesis in an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The complication was diagnosed during the first month of follow-up and was not associated with any endoleak. It was treated with the deployment of a proximal endograft cuff with suprarenal fixation. Endograft collapse may complicate endovascular repair of the abdominal aorta in rare situations. Upon diagnosis of the problem, endovascular repair of graft collapse seems to be feasible.",

    "abstract": "Often groin recurrences after varicose vein surgery are diagnosed and classified with the help of a duplex ultrasound scan. There are, however, no studies indicating if duplex ultrasound scans can reliably distinguish between the different forms of recurrent vessels, ie, neovascularization or a residual stump. To address this issue, we have conducted a prospective study in which ultrasound scan assessment of groin recurrences was compared to the histological classification of the recurrent groin veins.\nAll patients undergoing redo-surgery for symptomatic groin recurrences after previous stripping of the greater saphenous vein (GSV) during a 1-year period (May 2006-May 2007) were included in the study. Preoperatively, all patients had a duplex-ultrasound scan examination of the groin vessels. Based on the duplex scan findings, the recurrent veins in the groin were classified as either a residual stump or neovascularization. During the redo-surgery, a specimen of the recurrent groin veins was obtained and underwent histologic evaluation. Based on histologic criteria, the recurrence was also classified as a residual stump or neovascularization.\nDuring the 1-year study period, 125 groin recurrences in 95 consecutive patients (74 female, 21 male, mean age 58.7 years, standard deviation [SD] 10.3 years) were included. In the 119 cases where both duplex-ultrasound scan and histological evaluation were available, a residual stump was seen at the histological examination in 80.7% of cases, a neovascularization in 10.9% of cases, and a combination of both entities in 8.4% of cases. Duplex-ultrasound scan classified the recurrent groin veins as a residual stump in 68.1% of cases, as neovascularization in 26.1%, and as a combination of both in 5.8% of cases. With histological classification as the gold-standard, duplex ultrasound scans reached a sensitivity of 77.1% and a positive predictive value of 91.4% in correctly identifying a residual stump as the cause of recurrence. For the correct classification of neovascularization, sensitivity was 61.5% and the positive predictive value 25.8%, while a combination of both was recognized with a sensitivity of 10% and a positive predictive value of 14.3%.\nWhile duplex-ultrasound scan is a reliable tool to diagnose groin recurrences after varicose vein surgery, its validity in classifying the different types of recurrent groin vessels is limited. Especially the correct identification of neovascularization which is poor with a sensitivity of 62% and a positive predictive value of 26%. Histological examination should still be regarded as the gold-standard when trying to differentiate between different types of groin recurrences.",

    "abstract": "Forearm artery lesions are a frequent cause of distal fistula maturation failure. Surgical treatment is difficult because of highly calcified arteries. To redo the arteriovenous anastomosis higher up the forearm is technically difficult and often ineffective because arteries cannot be enlarged. It also causes a loss in puncture zone. Creation of brachial accesses leads to a high risk of distal ischemia.\nFrom September 2000 to September 2006, we performed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of forearm arteries in 25 patients with failing distal access maturation. We reported immediate results of the dilatation and retrospectively analyzed the outcome of the accesses after the procedure.\nForearm artery PTA was achieved in all 25 patients. Three main complications occurred: severe spasms precluding precise assessment of the artery patency after dilatation, rupture easily treated by prolonged low-pressure balloon inflation, and early rethrombosis leading to access loss. Follow-up was available in 23 patients. PTA failed to restore a sufficient access flow in two patients (the access loss and an insufficient increase in flow). In the remaining 21 (91%), accesses started to be used for hemodialysis without difficulties. Primary patency access rates after PTA were 83% (range, 60%-93%) at 1 year and 74% (range, 47%-89%) at 2 years. Secondary access patency rates were 86% (range, 64%-95%) at 1 and 3 years.\nWhen a distal access fails to mature because of forearm artery lesions, PTA should be done and will salvage the fistula without risk of distal ischemia and cardiac failure. Efficacy of PTA clearly influences surgical strategy and is a major argument in favor of attempting to create distal accesses in patients with mild distal artery lesions. Even in cases of failure, such as early occlusion of the fistula, this technique does not jeopardize further proximal access creation. Forearm access creation should be avoided only in cases of extremely severe distal artery lesions.",

Impaired cerebral autoregulation and post-revascularization changes in cerebral hemodynamics are the main mechanisms involved in the development of the syndrome. Hyperperfusion syndrome may be fatal once an intracranial hemorrhage occurs. This article reviews the literature, intending to make a synthesis of all new data concerning the clinical manifestations of hyperperfusion syndrome, the pathophysiologic pathways involved in its development, the prediction, and the appropriate management. Also, a review of the most recent series of hyperperfusion syndrome following carotid revascularization, both with classic open endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting has been performed.",

    "abstract": "To assess outcomes and develop duplex scan criteria that will reliably determine the luminal status of covered and uncovered renal stents following fenestrated and branched endovascular repair.\nA prospective database of patients treated with fenestrated and branched endografts between 2001 and 2006 was reviewed. All patients with evidence of renal artery pathology including duplex scan assessed peak systolic velocity (PSV) <50 or >200 cm/s, renal aortic ratio (RAR) >3.5, elevation of the serum creatinine >30%, computed tomography (CT) evidence of renal stenosis underwent further analyses including medical chart review, and a review of CT and duplex scan imaging data. Correlations of ultrasound scan, CT, angiographic, and clinical outcomes were conducted and receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was performed. Freedom from stenosis or occlusion was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis with differences assessed by log rank tests.\nA total of 518 renal arteries were treated with uncovered or covered renal stents (287 patients). Mean follow-up was 25 months. The estimated freedom from stenosis at 12, 24, and 36 months were 95% (95% confidence interval [CI] 93-98), 92% (89-96), and 89% (85-93) for uncovered stents, and 98% (96-100), 97% (95-100), and 95% (91-100) for covered stents (log rank P = .04). Secondary interventions were performed in 20% of the patients who developed stenoses. Only one of the detected stenoses that was not treated with a secondary intervention progressed to occlusion. Duplex scan criteria derived from ROC analysis correlating with curved planar reconstruction (CPR) from axial imaging data calculated a 60-99% in-stent stenosis to be associated with a PSV >280 cm/s or RAR >4.5. Occlusions were best identified by a mid renal artery PSV <57 cm/s in conjunction with an RAR <1.2.\nRevised ultrasound scan criteria have been developed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive interrogation of renal stents following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Covered renal stents are associated with a lower incidence of in-stent stenosis and are thus recommended over uncovered stents for use in fenestrated or branched endografts.",

    "abstract": "Low intra-aneurysm sac pressure has been shown to correlate with sac shrinkage following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) whereas high pressure results in sac enlargement. The Resilient AneuRx (RSA) has higher density Dacron compared with the standard AneuRx (STA) and was developed in an attempt to reduce type 4 and 5 endoleaks, thereby more effectively reducing sac pressure. The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of RSA and STA in reducing sac pressure in a chronic canine aneurysm model.\nArtificial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) aneurysm (26 x 50 mm) with an Endosure wireless pressure sensor (CardioMEMS, Atlanta, Ga) attached to the inner surface was implanted in the abdominal aorta of 10 mongrel dogs. Two weeks after creation of the aneurysm, each animal underwent EVAR with either STA (n = 5) or RSA (n = 5). Following EVAR, intra-sac pressure was measured with the implanted wireless pressure sensor up to 3 months postoperatively when the animals were sacrificed.\nEVAR was successful with no signs of an endoleak in all 10 dogs. Pressure sensing with the wireless sensor was also successful in each animal until the end of the study. Systolic intra-sac pressure remained at a high level in the STA group, whereas it gradually lowered over time in the RSA group. This difference reached statistical significance at 2 months and lasted to 3 months. No endoleak was detected in either group at the time of sacrifice. Gross analysis confirmed that all the aneurysm sacs were thrombosed without any flow inside the sac.\nDespite absence of an endoleak, intra-sac pressure remained high in the STA group. RSA effectively reduced sac pressure over time. Graft porosity appears to be an important factor that may determine the outcome of EVAR. These findings may be useful in designing improved endograft.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of endovascular aneurysm repair, a greater proportion of open aneurysm repairs in the future are expected to be more complex and require suprarenal cross-clamping. We sought to evaluate the effects of suprarenal (SR) vs infrarenal (IR) aortic cross-clamp position in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in an updated single center series.\nAll elective open AAA repairs performed at our institution between 1990 and 2006 were entered into a prospective database and reviewed retrospectively. Our main stratification variable was SR vs IR. The SR group was further subdivided into those requiring an adjunctive renal revascularization procedure (SR+RRP; n = 54) and those who did not (SR-RRP; n = 117). Univariate and multivariate models were used to analyze the effect of baseline variables and operative variables on our primary endpoint 30-day mortality as well as secondary endpoints such as major adverse events, postoperative decline in renal function (defined as doubling of baseline creatinine to level >2 mg/dL, or new-onset dialysis) and long-term survival. A propensity score model was developed to control for confounding variables associated with the use of an SR cross-clamp.\nA total of 1020 patients underwent elective AAA repair, of which 849 (83.2%) were IR and 171 (16.8%) were SR. Diabetes (14.6% vs 9.1%, P = .027), hypertension (70.2% vs 61.4%, P = .03), and chronic renal failure (14.0% vs 4.7%, P = .001) were more prevalent in the SR group, and mean aneurysm size was larger (6.0 cm vs 5.6 cm, P = .001). Estimated blood loss was higher (1919 mL vs 1257 mL, P = .001) in the SR group, as was mean length of stay (12.6 days vs 10.7 days, P = .047). Perioperative (30-day) mortality rate was 1.8% for the SR group and 1.2% for the IR group (P = .44). Postoperative decline in renal function was 17.0% in SR vs 9.5% in IR (P = .003), however, new-onset dialysis was rare (0.6% SR, 0.8% IR, P = NS). The combination of SR+RRP was associated with an increased risk for postoperative decline in renal function (14.8% SR+RRP, 4.3% SR-RRP, P = .016). Preoperative renal failure was strongly associated with postoperative renal decline (odds ratio [OR] 8.15, 2.92-22.8, P < .0001). Propensity score analysis demonstrated that the use of an SR cross-clamp was associated with an increased risk for postoperative renal decline (OR 2.66, 1.28-5.50, P = .009). Major adverse events were more prevalent in the SR group compared to the IR group (17.0% vs 9.5%, P = .003). Five-year survival was 69.1% + 1.9% for the IR group and 67.7% + 4.3% for the SR group (P = 0.38) by life table analysis.\nSuprarenal cross-clamping is associated with low mortality and significant but acceptable morbidity, including postoperative decline in renal function. The results from this series may serve as relevant background data when evaluating emerging branched and fenestrated endograft technologies.",

A 78-year-old man diagnosed with ruptured infected (Bacteroides fragilis) AAA underwent in situ replacement of the abdominal aorta using a bifurcated equine pericardial roll graft with concomitant omentum flap wrapping. A 50-year-old man diagnosed with ruptured infected (Streptococcus agalactiae) AAA underwent the same procedure, except the graft was straight. Computed tomography of this patient revealed no graft dilation or surrounding fluid accumulation at 48 months after surgery.

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that silent embolic infarcts on computed tomography (CT) brain scans can predict ipsilateral neurologic hemispheric events and stroke in patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis.\nIn a prospective multicenter natural history study, 821 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis graded with duplex scanning who had CT brain scans were monitored every 6 months for a maximum of 8 years. Duplex scans were reported centrally, and stenosis was expressed as a percentage in relation to the normal distal internal carotid criteria used by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists. CT brain scans were reported centrally by a neuroradiologist. In 146 patients (17.8%), 8 large cortical, 15 small cortical, 72 discrete subcortical, and 51 basal ganglia ipsilateral infarcts were present; these were considered likely to be embolic and were classified as such. Other infarct types, lacunes (n = 15), watershed (n = 9), and the presence of diffuse white matter changes (n = 95) were not considered to be embolic.\nDuring a mean follow-up of 44.6 months (range, 6 months-8 years), 102 ipsilateral hemispheric neurologic events (amaurosis fugax in 16, 38 transient ischemic attacks [TIAs], and 47 strokes) occurred, 138 patients died, and 24 were lost to follow-up. In 462 patients with 60% to 99% stenosis, the cumulative event-free rate at 8 years was 0.81 (2.4% annual event rate) when embolic infarcts were absent and 0.63 (4.6% annual event rate) when present (log-rank P = .032). In 359 patients with <60% stenosis, embolic infarcts were not associated with increased risk (log-rank P = .65). In patients with 60% to 99% stenosis, the cumulative stroke-free rate was 0.92 (1.0% annual stroke rate) when embolic infarcts were absent and 0.71 (3.6% annual stroke rate) when present (log-rank P = .002). In the subgroup of 216 with moderate 60% to 79% stenosis, the cumulative TIA or stroke-free rate in the absence and presence of embolic infarcts was 0.90 (1.3% annual rate) and 0.65 (4.4% annual rate), respectively (log-rank P = .005).\nThe presence of silent embolic infarcts can identify a high-risk group for ipsilateral hemispheric neurologic events and stroke and may prove useful in the management of patients with moderate asymptomatic carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Ulcer healing is a seldom reported outcome in studies of critical leg ischemia (CLI). The aim of this study was to analyze local factors affecting ulcer healing time after infrainguinal bypass surgery (IBS) for CLI Fontaine IV.\nIn this prospective single center cohort study, 110 patients (113 legs) undergoing IBS due to CLI with ischemic tissue defects during year 2006 were followed prospectively for 1 year after the bypass. Ulcer location, duration, presence of gangrene, and the University of Texas wound classification (UTWCS) were determined at presentation. Healing time of the ischemic tissue defects, leg salvage, patency, and survival were calculated. The characteristics of the ischemic tissue lesions and patient comorbidities were analyzed to determine risk factors for adverse outcome.\nComplete ulcer healing (+/-SE) was achieved in 74% +/- 5% of the legs 12 months after IBS. Median ulcer healing time was 186 days (range, 11 to >365 days). Leg salvage, secondary patency, and survival at 12 months were 87% +/- 3%, 82% +/- 4%, and 76% +/- 5%, respectively. Amputation-free survival with healed ulcers was attained in 55% at 12 months. Ischemic tissue lesions located in the mid- and hindfoot had significantly prolonged ulcer healing time (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1 to 0.9, P = .044). None of the UTWCS classes predicted either ulcer healing time or leg salvage. Median ulcer duration before IBS was 68 days, range, 6 to 1154 days. Ulcer duration did not correlate with ulcer healing time (Spearman r = 0.138, P = .267). Ischemic ulcers with gangrene were not associated with prolonged ulcer healing time (P = .353).\nThe location of the ischemic tissue lesions influences ulcer healing time. According to our study UTWCS can be used as descriptive classification of ischemic ulcers but it does not predict the ulcer healing time or leg salvage after infrainguinal bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Owing to its structural and anatomic characteristics, imaging of the lymphatic system has been difficult. The conventional diagnostic method of radionuclide-based imaging has the disadvantage of poor resolution. Recent work has shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can depict lymphatic channels in patients with lymphedema. This study evaluated the anatomic and functional images of contrast MR lymphangiography in the diagnosis of limb lymphatic circulation disorders.\nThe study enrolled 27 patients with primary lymphedema. Four patients had bilateral disease, and 23 had unilateral disease. Contrast-enhanced lymphangiography was performed with a 3.0-T MR unit after the intracutaneous injection of gadobenate dimeglumine into the interdigital webs of the dorsal foot. The kinetics of enhanced lymph flow within the lymphatic system were calculated using the formula [speed in cm = total length of visualized lymph vessel in cm/inspection time in minutes] and by comparing dynamic nodal enhancement and time-signal intensity curves between edematous and contralateral limbs. Morphologic abnormalities of the lymphatic system were also evaluated.\nExamination of the MRIs after injection of the contrast agent showed enhanced lymphatic channels consistently visualized in all clinical lymphedematous limbs and in five contralateral limbs of unilateral lymphedema patients. The speed of flow within the lymphatics of lymphedematous limbs was 0.3 to 1.48 cm/min. Contrast enhancement in inguinal nodes of edematous limbs was significantly less than that of contralateral limbs (P < .01). Dynamic measurement of contrast enhancement showed a remarkable lowering of peak time (P < .01) and peak enhancement (P < .01), and a delay in outflow in inguinal nodes of affected limbs compared with that of control limbs. Postcontrast MRI also depicted varied distribution patterns of lymphatics and abnormal lymph flow pathways within lymph nodes in the limbs with lymphatic circulation disorders.\nContrast MR lymphangiography with gadobenate dimeglumine is capable of visualizing the precise anatomy of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes in lymphedematous limbs. It also provides information concerning the functional status of lymph flow transport in the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes of these limbs.",

    "abstract": "Compared with angiogenesis, arteriogenesis is a distinct process based on the remodeling and maturation of pre-existing arterioles into large conductance arteries. Therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed as a potential treatment for ischemic atherosclerotic diseases. Since a variety of angiogenic factors have been tested with inconsistent so far clinical results, the challenge remains in identifying the factor(s) that will stimulate functional neovascularization. Thrombin has been reported to play a pivotal role in the initiation of angiogenesis by regulating and organizing a network of angiogenic mediators. Also, it was recently demonstrated that thrombin is a potent anti-apoptotic factor for endothelial cells, providing evidence on a potential role of thrombin in vascular protection and maintenance of vessel integrity. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that thrombin may promote the development of mature functional blood vessels.\nSeventy-four (n=74) rabbits underwent bilateral femoral artery surgical excision. On the 20th postsurgical day increasing doses of VEGF or bFGF or thrombin were injected in one ischemic limb per rabbit and an equal volume of normal saline to the contralateral control limbs. Quantification of newly developed collateral vessels (diameter >500 mum) was performed by transauricular intra-arterial subtraction angiography. Computerized quantitative analysis of collateral vessels in angiography images was based on the concept of multiscale structural tensor. Perfusion analysis of an in vivo dynamic computed tomography study was performed to investigate hemodynamic recovery of the distal ischemic limbs. Tissue perfusion analysis was performed with the semiquantitative slope methodology, which focuses on the first-pass arterial phase.\nA single administration of thrombin exhibited a dose-dependent increase of arteriogenic outcome. Thrombin at 5000 IU induced a 30.2 +/- 7.4% (P < 0.05) increase of total collateral area and length. Both VEGF and bFGF were without any significant effect at the concentrations used. Functional estimation of limb perfusion showed a statistically significant increase of blood flow recovery only for thrombin. The semiquantitative slope method perfusion score differed significantly in the 5000 IU thrombin treated limbs (5.7 +/- 0.3 vs 5.0 +/- 0.3 in control ischemic limbs; P < .05), and was not significantly inferior from the score of normal nonoperated limbs (6.5 +/- 0.3) suggesting a trend towards hemodynamic recovery of distal limb perfusion.\nIn a rabbit hindlimb ischemia model, thrombin promoted the formation of large collateral vessels and improved the perfusion of distal ischemic tissue. These results provide new insights in understanding the involvement of thrombin in vascular formation and point to a novel role of thrombin in arteriogenesis.",

Thrombin at 5000 IU induced a 30.2 +/- 7.4% (P < 0.05) increase of total collateral area and length. Both VEGF and bFGF were without any significant effect at the concentrations used. Functional estimation of limb perfusion showed a statistically significant increase of blood flow recovery only for thrombin. The semiquantitative slope method perfusion score differed significantly in the 5000 IU thrombin treated limbs (5.7 +/- 0.3 vs 5.0 +/- 0.3 in control ischemic limbs; P < .05), and was not significantly inferior from the score of normal nonoperated limbs (6.5 +/- 0.3) suggesting a trend towards hemodynamic recovery of distal limb perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Claudication is the most common presentation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), producing significant ambulatory compromise. Claudicating patients, most of whom are elderly, have reduced mobility and poor health outcomes, including an increased risk of falls. The gait of elderly fallers is characterized by increased variability. Increase in the variability of the locomotor system makes the gait more noisy and unstable. The purpose of this study is to investigate gait variability in patients with PAD.\nNineteen symptomatic PAD patients (age, 63.6 +/- 9.8 years; body mass, 82.1 +/- 18.5 kg; height, 1.71 +/- 0.06 m) walked on a treadmill in the absence of pain or claudication symptoms while joint flexion and extension kinematics were captured. Results were compared with results obtained from 17 matched healthy controls (age, 65.2 +/- 12.5 years; body mass, 82.0 +/- 25.9.5 kg; height, 1.73 +/- 0.08 m). Relative joint angles were calculated for the ankle, knee, and hip flexion/extension, and the stride-to-stride variability of joint flexion and extension was calculated from at least 30 consecutive footfalls. Variability was expressed using the largest Lyapunov exponent, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. Independent t tests were used to compare gait variability between groups.\nSymptomatic PAD patients had significantly higher largest Lyapunov exponent values and coefficient of variation values for all joints, and higher standard deviation values at the ankle and the hip (P < .05).\nSymptomatic PAD patients have increased gait variability at the ankle, knee, and hip joints at baseline ambulation in the absence of claudication pain. Our findings indicate significant baseline deterioration in the locomotor system of symptomatic PAD patients. This deterioration results in increased noise and instability of gait and is a potential contributing factor to the falls and mobility problems experienced by symptomatic PAD patients.",

This study evaluates the outcomes of percutaneous endoluminal therapy for symptomatic restenosis (>50% on angiography) after renal intervention.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent endovascular intervention for ARAS and were followed by duplex ultrasound scan between January 1990 and January 2008. Clinical benefit defined as freedom from recurrent hypertension or renal-related morbidity (increase in persistent creatinine >20% of baseline, progression to hemodialysis, death from renal-related causes), anatomic patency, restenosis, and patient survival were measured.\nA total of 447 patients underwent 619 renal artery interventions. A total of 80 vessels restenosed with an actuarial restenosis rate of 19% at 5 years. Of these restenoses, 65 (81%) were associated with recurrent symptoms (recurrent hypertension 84%, or continuing deterioration in renal function 16%). Fifty-five (85%) underwent repeat angioplasty and 10 underwent bypass surgery. The remainder was observed. The 55 percutaneous interventions were performed in 51 patients (61% female, average age 62 years, range, 51-85). A total of 73% had metabolic syndrome, 58% had hyperlipidemia, and 51% were considered diabetic; all of them had primary stenting during their first procedure. There was a 4% technical failure rate in both groups. In the restenosis group, the presence of stent was associated with a 9% technical failure rate, while in the absence of a stent the technical failure rate was only 3% (P < .05). At 5 years, outcomes were equivalent between the primary and recurrent groups for survival (76 +/- 2% vs 75 +/- 8%, primary vs recurrent), cumulative patency (82 +/- 3% vs 70 +/- 10%), freedom from restenosis (81 +/- 3% vs 81 +/- 9%), and retained clinical benefit (44 +/- 4% vs 46 +/- 10%). By Cox proportional hazards and multivariate analysis, administration of statins were associated with freedom from restenosis in the recurrent lesions. Statins, contralateral kidney size (>9 cm) and a >/=20% improvement in baseline creatinine with 3 months were associated with freedom from recurrent symptoms. Restenosis after therapy in recurrent lesions was significantly correlated with recurrent symptoms (Spearman r = 0.4614, P < .0004).\nPercutaneous reintervention for renal artery restenosis is safe and effective with equivalent outcomes to primary intervention. The patients are more likely to present with recurrent hypertension and be younger and of female gender than patients presenting for primary intervention.

    "abstract": "In different regions of the United States, highly variable rates have been documented for a wide range of procedures, such as prostatectomy and caesarean section. It is generally held that this variation is due to inconsistent physician practice patterns or other nonmedical considerations. Only limited research has been conducted regarding vascular surgical operations. We examined national data on the utilization of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to determine the extent and diversity of regional variations.\nMedicare discharge data quantified the per capita rate of CEA in 50 states and the District of Columbia in 2003. Multiple metrics pertaining to risk factors, socioeconomic status, access to care, provider density, and local health care capacity were quantified. We performed bivariate analysis, Pearson (PC) or Spearman (SC) correlations, and multiple regression modeling.\nIn 2003, 83,164 CEAs were performed on 28,767,985 enrollees. CEA rates were 28.9 +/- 7.8 per 10,000 (range, 5.6-44.7 per 10,000). The rate of CEA was highly correlated with the number of heart disease deaths (PC = 0.575, P < .0001), deaths by stroke (PC = 0.504, P = .0002), and percentage of adult smokers in a state (PC = 0.643, P < .0001). These three factors held the strongest association with variation in CEA rates. Statistically, they explained 51% of the variation in total number of CEAs (R(2) = 0.5074, P < .0001). Median annual income (PC = -0.608, P < .0001) and percentage of college degrees (PC = -0.606, P < .0001) displayed inverse relationships to CEA rates. Per capita hospital beds (SC = 0.540, P < .0001) and rural health care clinics (SC = 0.518, P < .0001) exhibited positive correlations. The number of physicians or vascular surgeons did not predict higher utilization of CEA.\nThe strongest correlations for CEA were three markers associated with atherosclerotic disease: percentage of adult smokers and deaths from heart disease or stroke. Geographic variation in this vascular procedure is chiefly associated with variance in markers of disease prevalence, not physician preference or other nonmedical factors. The increased utilization of carotid stenting, accompanied by the participation of a much wider range of medical specialists, may affect this relationship in the future.",

This study evaluates the factors that impact long term anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular therapy of ARAS in patients with a solitary functioning kidney.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent endovascular intervention for ARAS and identified patients with a solitary functioning kidney (absent or nonfunctioning contralateral kidney) and patients with contralateral normal kidney (for comparison) between January 1990 and January 2008. Indications for intervention in the solitary functioning kidney were poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [BP] >90 mm Hg on >3 antihypertensive medications) and/or elevated creatinine (Cr >/=1.5 mg/dL). Clinical benefit was defined as freedom from composite recurrent symptoms (recurrent hypertension or renal-related morbidity-increase in persistent creatinine >20% of baseline, progression to hemodialysis, and death from renal-related causes), anatomic patency and patient survival were measured.\nA total of 242 patients (56% male, average age 69 years, range, 45-90) underwent angioplasty (23%) or primary stenting (77%) of a single renal artery with a normal contralateral renal vessel and kidney and 73 patients (58% male, average age 70 years, range, 52-89) underwent angioplasty (37%) or primary stenting (63%) for a solitary functioning kidney. There were no significant differences in mortality or morbidity between the groups. There was a significant difference in the long-term survival with 55 +/- 8% patients with a normal contralateral kidney vs 27 +/- 7% patients with a solitary functioning kidney alive at 10 years. Clinical benefit was 67 +/- 6% and 67 +/- 4% at 5 years and 63 +/- 8% and 62 +/- 4% at 10 years for solitary functioning kidney and normal contralateral groups, respectively. Using proportional hazard analysis, the predictors of long-term clinical benefit were ipsilateral kidney size (>9 cm), no immediate deterioration in function, and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) >30 mL/min/1.73m(2). Neither control of diabetes nor the administration of statins was shown to influence outcomes in the solitary functioning kidney.\nIntervention in patients with a solitary functioning kidney is a safe procedure and improves or stabilizes renal function in 82% of patients. Clinical benefit is dictated by preoperative GFR, renal size, and the occurrence of acute functional injury after the procedure.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has gained wide acceptance for the elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), leading to interest in similar treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate national outcomes after EVAR for RAAA and to assess the effect of institutional volume metrics.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients treated with open or EVAR for RAAA, 2001-2006. Procedure volume was determined for each institution categorizing hospitals as low-, medium-, and high-volume. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes related to resource utilization. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine independent predictors of EVAR usage and mortality.\nFrom 2001 to 2006, an estimated 27,750 hospital discharges for RAAA occurred; 11.5% were treated with EVAR. EVAR utilization increased over time (5.9% in 2001 to 18.9% in 2006, P < .0001) while overall RAAA rates remained constant. EVAR had a lower overall in-hospital mortality than open repair (31.7% vs 40.7%, P < .0001), an effect which amplified when stratified by institutional volume. On multivariable regression, open repair independently predicted mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.89). EVAR usage for RAAA increased with age (>80 years) (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.30-1.93), high elective EVAR volume (>40/y) vs medium (19-40/y) (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.86-3.78) and low (<19/y) (OR 5.37; 95% CI 3.60-8.0). EVAR had a shorter length of stay (11.1 vs 13.8 days, P < .0001), higher discharges to home (65.1% vs 53.9%, P < .0001), and lower charges ($108,672 vs $114,784, P < .0001).\nIn the United States, for RAAA, EVAR had a lower postoperative mortality than open repair. Higher elective open repair as well as RAAA volume increased this mortality advantage for EVAR. These results support regionalization of RAAA repair to high volume centers whenever possible and a wider adoption of endovascular repair of RAAA nationwide.",

EVAR utilization increased over time (5.9% in 2001 to 18.9% in 2006, P < .0001) while overall RAAA rates remained constant. EVAR had a lower overall in-hospital mortality than open repair (31.7% vs 40.7%, P < .0001), an effect which amplified when stratified by institutional volume. On multivariable regression, open repair independently predicted mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.89). EVAR usage for RAAA increased with age (>80 years) (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.30-1.93), high elective EVAR volume (>40/y) vs medium (19-40/y) (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.86-3.78) and low (<19/y) (OR 5.37; 95% CI 3.60-8.0). EVAR had a shorter length of stay (11.1 vs 13.8 days, P < .0001), higher discharges to home (65.1% vs 53.9%, P < .0001), and lower charges ($108,672 vs $114,784, P < .0001).",

    "abstract": "Rupture of infected anastomotic femoral artery pseudoaneurysms (AFAPs) represents a limb and life-threatening condition requiring emergency intervention. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a hybrid repair for ruptured infected AFAPs consisted of percutaneous stent-graft deployment and second-stage surgical debridement.\nBetween October 2004 and January 2008, 6 patients (3 female, mean age 65.8 +/- 11.4 years) with ruptured infected AFAPs were treated with emergent percutaneous stent-graft implantation and secondary surgical debridement. Three patients had undergone a femoro-popliteal and 1 a femoro-tibial bypass for peripheral arterial disease, while 2 patients had a femoral arteriovenous graft (AVG) for hemodialysis access due to chronic renal failure. Four pseudoaneurysms were located at the common femoral artery (CFA) and 2 involved the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Mean pseudoaneurysm diameter was 6.8 +/- 0.9 mm (range, 5.4-7.8 mm). The mean interval between the initial operation and presentation to our department was 26.7 +/- 14.5 months (range, 7-50 months). All patients suffered from severe comorbidities and were judged unfit for major surgery under general anesthesia.\nAll patients were successfully managed by urgent percutaneous deployment of covered stents at the site of the arterial deficit. Extensive surgical debridement along with pseudoaneurysm excision was accomplished successfully in all 6 patients 1-3 days after stent-graft placement under local anesthesia, without the need for extended vessel exposure for proximal and distal control. No death occurred within 30 days after stent-graft implantation. During follow-up, (mean 14.1 +/- 8.2 months, range, 6 to 25 months) all stent-grafts remained patent without endoleak, while no signs of recurrent local or systemic infection were noticed. Two patients died at 8 and 10 months after the procedure due to heart failure complications and acute myocardial infarction, respectively.\nEmergency stent-graft deployment, followed by secondary surgical debridement and long-term antimicrobial therapy is a viable alternative for ruptured infected AFAPs. Especially for patients unfit for major surgery, it may be the most favorable treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Aortobronchial fistula (ABF) and aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) are rare but lethal if untreated; open thoracic surgery is associated with high operative mortality and morbidity. In this case series, we sought to investigate outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for emergency cases of ABF and AEF.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients with AEF and ABF undergoing TEVAR in three European teaching hospitals between 2000 and January 2009. Eleven patients were identified including 6 patients with ABF, 4 patients with AEF, and 1 patient with a combined ABF and AEF. In-hospital outcomes and follow-up after TEVAR were evaluated.\nMedian age was 63 years (interquartile range, 31); 8 were male. Ten patients presented with hemoptysis or hematemesis; 4 developed hemorrhagic shock. All patients underwent immediate TEVAR, and 3 AEF patients required additional esophageal surgery. Five patients died (45%), including 3 patients with AEF, 1 patient with ABF, and 1 patient with a combined ABF and AEF, after a median duration of 22 days (interquartile range, 51 days). The patient with AEF that survived had received early esophageal reconstruction. Causes of death were: sepsis (n = 2), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 1), thoracic infections (n = 1), and aortic rupture (n = 1). Median follow-up of surviving patients was 45 months (interquartile range, 45 months). Six additional vascular interventions were performed in 3 survivors.\nTEVAR does prevent immediate exsanguination in patients admitted with AEF and ABF, but after initial deployment of the endograft and control of the hemodynamic status, most patients, in particular those with AEF, are at risk for infectious complications. Early esophageal repair after TEVAR appears to improve the survival in case of AEF. Therefore, TEVAR may serve as a bridge to surgery in emergency cases of AEF with subsequent definitive open operative repair of the esophageal defect as soon as possible. In patients with ABF, additional open surgery may not be necessary after the endovascular procedure.",

    "abstract": "Advances in endovascular interventions have expanded the options available for the invasive treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Whether endovascular interventions substitute for conventional bypass surgery or are simply additive has not been investigated, and their effect on amputation rates is unknown.\nWe sought to analyze trends in lower extremity endovascular interventions (angioplasty and atherectomy), lower extremity bypass surgery, and major amputation (above and below-knee) in Medicare beneficiaries between 1996 and 2006. We used 100% samples of Medicare Part B claims to calculate annual procedure rates of lower extremity bypass surgery, endovascular interventions (angioplasty and atherectomy), and major amputation between 1996 and 2006. Using physician specialty identifiers, we also examined trends in the specialty performing the primary procedure.\nBetween 1996 and 2006, the rate of major lower extremity amputation declined significantly (263 to 188 per 100,000; risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-0.8). Endovascular interventions increased more than threefold (from 138 to 455 per 100,000; RR = 3.30; 95% CI: 2.9-3.7) while bypass surgery decreased by 42% (219 to 126 per 100,000; RR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.5-0.7). The increase in endovascular interventions consisted both of a growth in peripheral angioplasty (from 135 to 337 procedures per 100,000; RR = 2.49; 95% CI: 2.2-2.8) and the advent of percutaneous atherectomy (from 3 to 118 per 100,000; RR = 43.12; 95% CI: 34.8-52.0). While radiologists performed the majority of endovascular interventions in 1996, more than 80% were performed by cardiologists and vascular surgeons by 2006. Overall, the total number of all lower extremity vascular procedures almost doubled over the decade (from 357 to 581 per 100,000; RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.5-1.8).\nEndovascular interventions are now performed much more commonly than bypass surgery in the treatment of lower extremity PAD. These changes far exceed simple substitution, as more than three additional endovascular interventions were performed for every one procedure declined in lower extremity bypass surgery. During this same time period, major lower extremity amputation rates have fallen by more than 25%. However, further study is needed before any causal link can be established between lower extremity vascular procedures and improved rates of limb salvage in patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "Venovenous bypass has been the standard in relieving chronic total occlusions of iliac veins. The technical feasibility of percutaneous recanalization was previously reported. Routine applicability of this technique in a wide spectrum of lesions and patients, stent patency, and clinical outcome forms the basis of this presentation.\nDuring a 9-year period, 167 limbs in 159 unselected patients in a consecutive series with post-thrombotic chronic total occlusions of the iliac and adjacent vein segments underwent percutaneous attempts at recanalization. Patients were not selected based on venographic appearance or extent of the lesion, or excluded because of a preemptive choice of open venovenous bypass surgery.\nPercutaneous recanalization was successful in 139 of 167 limbs (83%), including patients with bilateral occlusions and 14 patients with inferior vena cava filters incorporated in the treated occlusion. Median age was 53 years (range, 18-84 years). Thrombophilia was identified in 44 patients. Venous dermatitis/ulcer was found in 46% of the treated limbs. Recanalization involved three or more totally occluded vein segments in 42% of the limbs. The cumulative secondary stent patency rate at 4 years was 66%. The cumulative marked relief of pain and swelling at 3 years was 79% and 66%, respectively. Cumulative healing of venous ulcer at 33 months was 56%. Quality of life metrics improved significantly.\nMost femoroiliocaval chronic total occlusions lesions can be successfully recanalized percutaneously with very little morbidity, minimal downtime, sustained long-term stent patency, and substantial clinical improvement. The procedure has wide applicability in a broad spectrum of symptomatic patients, including those with extensive lesions, and can be considered for routine use.",

For patients with associated aortic dissections, current endovascular technology has not been matured to address branch reconstructions that derive from separate lumens, making open surgical reconstruction the only proven method for repair. The required exposures of the thoracoabdominal aorta are expansive, and the extent of aortic replacement mandates efficient technique. Furthermore, a well-orchestrated team of surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, and perfusionists are all integral to achieving good outcomes and keeping operative courses tightly managed. Techniques to address extensive aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aorta are reviewed in detail here, and videos are provided on The Journal website to show relevant anatomical features.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the distribution and degree of symmetry of lower extremity artery stenoses in an unselected elderly population and its relation to a reduced ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement.\nThis was a population-based study set in a university hospital comprising 306 randomly selected 70-year-old individuals participating in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study. Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and bilateral ABI measurements were performed in each participant. The prevalence of stenosis >or=50% was evaluated in nine different arterial segments in both legs: common iliac artery (CIA), external iliac artery (EIA), common femoral artery (CFA), superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery (PA), tibioperoneal trunk (TPTr), anterior tibial artery (ATA), posterior tibial artery (PTA), and peroneal artery. The relations between the prevalences of stenosis in different arterial segments in the right and left leg were assessed. An evaluation was made of the relation between a >or=50% stenosis and an ABI <0.9 in the different segments.\nThe prevalence of stenosis was 0% to 21%. In all segments, a stenosis was more commonly found in one of the legs only than in both legs. The prevalence of >or=50% stenosis in the right leg only, left leg only, and both legs was 0.3%, 0.7%, and 0% in the CIA; 0.3%, 1.0%, and 0.7% in the EIA; 0%, 0%, and 0% in the CFA; 2.0%, 1.3%, and 0.7% in the SFA; 0.7%, 0.7%, and 0.3% in the PA; 1.0%, 0.7%, and 0% in the TPTr; 5.6%, 6.3%, and 8.6% in the ATA; 0.7%, 1.7%, and 0% in the peroneal artery; and in 2.0%, 2.7%, and 3.4% in the PTA. When the legs were compared, a significant correlation was found for the presence of a >or=50% stenosis in the EIA, SFA, PA, ATA, and PTA. Seventeen participants showed ABI <0.9. In logistic regression analysis with ABI <0.9 as dependent variable, stenosis in SFA, ATA, and PTA were the major independent variables to explain a low ABI in both of the legs.\nThe distribution of stenosis differs substantially when legs are compared. Despite this difference, stenosis in SFA, ATA, and PTA was the major determinant of a low ABI in both of the legs.",

Tibial artery interventional therapy has been proven to lead to limb salvage with low morbidity and mortality in patients with critical limb ischemia and should be used as a first line treatment mode in the majority of patients, especially in those with significant medical comorbidities. The exceptions are the patients with extensive tissue loss and infection, where endovascular therapy may not restore enough flow to achieve rapid healing and limb salvage, and those patients with tissue loss in the setting extensive, multi-level, occlusive disease, where patency to the completion of wound healing will be unlikely. However, differences in outcome between available devices are unknown and ways to increase long term patency remain poorly defined.",

    "abstract": "Controversy exists over the optimal hospital type to which high-risk surgical patients should be referred for operative management. While high volume centers have been traditionally advocated, recent evidence suggests teaching hospitals may have better outcomes for high-risk patients. We investigated whether mortality outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) were different between teaching hospitals and non-teaching hospitals, independent of hospital operative volume.\nA retrospective review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample dataset (1998-2004) was performed to identify open and endovascular (EVAR) repair for rAAA. Hospitals were stratified by teaching status, including teaching hospitals (TH) with any type of residency training program, those with general surgery training programs (GSTH) and those with vascular surgery training programs (VSTH). The association of hospital teaching status with in-hospital mortality for open AAA repair and EVAR was assessed via multi-level multivariable logistic regression, controlling for patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospital operative volume.\nOf 6636 open AAA repairs for rAAA, the overall perioperative mortality was 42%. Mortality was significantly lower at TH than non-TH (39.3% vs 44.5%; P < .05). Mortality was also lower at GSTH (38.7%) and VSTH (34.3%). After adjusting for hospital operative volume, patient demographics, and comorbidities, we found a 25% decrease in likelihood of in-hospital death at VSTH vs non-VSTH (odds ratio 0.75; 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.94; P < .05).\nIn-hospital mortality is significantly reduced for patients undergoing open AAA repair for rAAA at teaching hospitals and hospitals with vascular surgery training programs, independent of volume. These results suggest that in addition to factors associated with teaching hospitals in general, the type of specialty training within teaching institutions is a critical factor which may influence outcomes, specifically for patients with rAAA.",

Two patients had recurrent sepsis postoperatively but no vascular complications, two had elevated inflammatory markers during follow-up but were asymptomatic, and three patients had an uneventful follow-up.\nEndovascular treatment for MAA was feasible, with acceptable perioperative mortality and midterm outcome in this single-center case series. Recurrent sepsis and late relapse with a second MAA occurred, indicating the need of long-term antibiotic therapy and follow-up, as well as the possible need for secondary open repair in selected cases.

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a systematic disease presenting with a significant overlapping of cardiovascular disorders implicating coronary heart disease and its equivalents, peripheral arterial disease, carotid arterial disease, and aneurysm disease. Evaluating patient's atherosclerotic risk profile is essential to guide primary and secondary prevention. Atherosclerotic risk factor modifications reduce, significantly, cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity, particularly in high-risk patients. This article provides a reference guide for all conventional (eg, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension) and evolving (eg, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, inflammatory markers) risk factors of atherosclerosis and recommends the currently effective strategies for an overall cardiovascular risk reduction. As vascular surgeons, by definition, conduct the overall management of patients with vascular disease understanding of the development, assessment, and management of atherosclerotic risk factors should remain among their highest priorities.",

The family has become increasingly hostile towards Dr S. Cold, the consultants, the ICU nurses, and the janitorial staff. An estranged wife has called once to defer decision-making to the children. Three children intermittently visit and are openly critical of the medical care. One child is an ICU nurse supervisor at a small local suburban hospital. Dr Cold spoke to the family yesterday about instituting DNR orders and discontinuing some supportive therapy that was not working. The family first required another consultation and then demanded that Dr Cold transfer the patient to the hospital where the daughter works. The hospital does not provide tertiary care. A physician there is willing to assume responsibility. How should Dr Cold respond? A. Do as they request. B. Refuse outright. C. Call the accepting physician and explain why the case is futile. D. Take the matter to the ethics committee to prevent transfer. E. Call the wife and children to schedule an exploratory family conference and insist they come to a decision.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) nonmaturation increases reliance of hemodialysis patients on grafts and catheters, exposing them to associated high complication risks. This systematic review assessed the success rates and complications of therapeutic interventions in arm hemodialysis AVFs experiencing nonmaturation. It also compared the efficacy of preoperative clinical factors (eg, age, gender, race), and preoperatively and postoperatively acquired hemodynamic parameters (eg, arterial diameter or blood flow through the AVF) at stratifying risk of nonmaturation.\nTwo independent researchers used a systematic strategy to search literature databases and extract data from articles judged relevant and valid. The evidence base for this review comprised 33 articles, 12 about treatment, and 21 concerning risk stratification. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate summary measures for nonmaturation treatment success and risk stratification efficacy (eg, excess risk and relative risk) of preoperative clinical, preoperative hemodynamic, and postoperative hemodynamic risk factors.\nThe success rate of early endovascular or surgical treatment, defined as the possibility of achieving adequate hemodialysis, averaged 86%, with 1-year primary patencies of 51%, 1-year secondary patencies of 76%, and complication rates of 9.3%, with 5.5% minor complications. Overall, patients with preoperative clinical risk factors had excess nonmaturation risks of 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11%-30%) and a relative risk of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3-2.1). Patients with preoperative hemodynamic risk factors had average estimated excess risks of 24% (95% CI, 15%-33%) and a relative risk of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.0). Patients with hemodynamic risk factors present shortly after operation had excess nonmaturation risks of 50% (95% CI, 42%-58%) and a relative risk of 4.3 (95% CI, 3.4-5.5).\nPatients can be treated effectively for AVF nonmaturation early on, and it is possible to identify those patients at risk of nonmaturation most effectively with an early postoperative assessment of hemodynamic risk factors. Additional research is needed that concentrates on adopting the strategy of early treatment of patients with postoperative risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was performed in 26 consecutive patients considered fit for aneurysm repair. Besides information on aneurysm wall pathology, PET/CT identified 6 patients with concomitant malignancy. As a result of this coincidental finding, the operation was postponed in 2 patients and cancelled in 1. Although previous studies have shown that PET/CT might affect patient selection based on aneurysm wall inflammation, our preliminary results show a big impact on patient management as a result of the sensitivity of PET/CT for detecting malignancy. Future larger studies are warranted to investigate the effect and cost effectiveness of routine PET/CT in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is an integral component of intimal hyperplasia development and proteases are pivotal in the process. Understanding the role of urokinase signaling within the cells of vasculature remains poorly defined. The study examines the role of amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of urokinase on a pivotal cross-talk receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is transactivated by both G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases and is key to many of their responses. We hypothesize that A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domains (ADAM) allows the transactivation of EGFR by ATF.\nTo determine the role of ADAM in EGFR transactivation by ATF in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) during cell migration.\nHuman coronary VSMC were cultured in vitro. Assays of EGFR phosphorylation were examined in response to ATF (10 nM) in the presence and absence of the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor GM6001, the ADAM inhibitors TAPI-0 and TAPI-1, heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) inhibitor, CRM197, HB-EGF inhibitory antibodies, epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibitory antibodies, and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478. The small interference ribonucleic acid (siRNA) against EGFR and ADAM-9, ADAM-10, ADAM-12, and adenoviral delivered Gbg inhibitor, betaARK(CT) were also used.\nATF produced concentration-dependent VSMC migration (by wound assay and Boyden chamber), which was inhibited by increasing concentrations of AG1478. ATF was shown to induce time-dependent EGFR phosphorylation, which peaked at fourfold greater than control. Pre-incubation with the Gbetagamma inhibitor betaARK(CT) inhibited EGFR activation by ATF. This migratory and EGFR response was inhibited by AG1478 in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation with siRNA against EGFR blocked the ATF-mediated migratory and EGFR responses. EGFR phosphorylation by ATF was blocked by inhibition of MMP activity and the ligand HB-EGF. The presence of the ADAM inhibitors, TAPI-0 and TAPI-1 significantly decreased EGFR activation. EGFR phosphorylation by EGF was not interrupted by inhibition of MMP, ADAMs, or HB-EGF. Direct blockade of the EGFR prevented activation by both ATF and EGF. Incubation with siRNA to ADAM-9 and -10 significantly reduced HB-EGF release from VSMC and EGFR activation in response to ATF. The siRNA against ADAM-12 had no effect.\nATF can induce transactivation of EGFR by an ADAM-mediated, HB-EGF-dependent process. Targeting a pivotal cross-talk receptor such as EGFR is an attractive molecular target to inhibit cell migration.",

    "abstract": "To characterize and compare primary and restenotic lesions of the superficial femoral artery and analyze the contribution of TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling to the pathophysiology of peripheral artery occlusive disease.\nImmunohistochemical studies were performed on specimens retrieved from the superficial femoral artery of patients undergoing either atherectomy for primary atherosclerotic or recurrent disease after stenting and/or prior angioplasty. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significantly higher smooth muscle cell (SMC) content (alpha-actin+) and expression of Smad3 in restenotic lesions while primary lesions contained significantly more leukocytes (CD45+) and macrophages (CD68+). Further studies demonstrated colocalization of Smad3 with alpha-actin and PCNA, suggesting a role for Smad3 in the proliferation observed in restenotic lesions. To confirm a role for Smad3 in SMC proliferation, we both upregulated Smad3 via adenoviral mediated gene transfer (AdSmad3) and inhibited Smad3 through transfection with siRNA in human aortic SMCs, then assessed cell proliferation with tritiated thymidine. Overexpression of Smad3 enhanced whereas inhibition of Smad3 decreased cell proliferation.\nDifferences in cellular composition and cell proliferation in conjunction with the finding that Smad3 is expressed exclusively in restenotic disease suggest that TGF-beta, through Smad3 signaling, may play an essential role in SMC proliferation and the pathophysiology of restenosis in humans.",

    "abstract": "Short stretch bandages are very effective in the initial management of arm lymphedema. However, no studies to date have measured the pressure required to achieve specific amounts of volume reduction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between low and high-pressure bandaging in terms of therapeutically intended volume reduction of the compressed arm.\nExperimental, randomized and comparative study with two study-groups consisting of high and low initial interface pressure bandages. Thirty-six hospitalized patients in Nij Smellinghe hospital suffering from moderate to severe unilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema not responsive to outpatient treatment were included. Bilateral arm volume was measured by inverse water volumetry before, after two hours and after 24 hours of bandaging. The amount of edema was calculated by subtracting the volume of the diseased arm from that of the contralateral side. Sub-bandage pressure was measured after bandage application and two hours later. Bandages were then re-applied and the pressure was measured again. Twenty-four hours later, the pressure measurement was repeated and bandages were removed for final volumetry. Patients were randomized into two groups: group A received low pressure bandages (20-30 mm Hg) and group B received high pressure bandages (44-58 mm Hg). The main outcome measures were reduction of arm volume and edema volume in the affected arm in both study groups. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in sub-bandage pressure and patient comfort.\nMedian arm volume reduction after two and 24 hours was 104.5 mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 51.2-184.2) (-2.5%) (P < .0001) and 217 mL (95% CI, 143.9-280.2) (-5.2%) (P < .01) for group A and 56.5 mL (95% CI, -2.7-123.1) (n.s.) and 167.5 mL (95% CI, 105.2-316.1) (-4.2%) (P < .01) for group B, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the volume changes in group A and group B. After 24 hours, edema decreased by median percentage of 9.2% in group A and 4.8% in group B (n.s.). Bandages in group A were better tolerated. The sub-bandage pressure drop in the first two hours was between 41% and 48% in both treatment groups at both measuring sites. After 24 hours, the pressure drop was between 55% and 63%. No proximal swelling above the bandage was observed.\nInelastic, multi-layer, multi-component compression bandages with lower pressure (20-30 mm Hg) are better tolerated and achieve the same amount of arm volume reduction as bandages applied with higher pressure (44-58 mm Hg) in the first 24 hours.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is of proven benefit for patients with coronary artery disease. Patients who successfully complete CR have a statistically significant reduction in the risk of fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common in patients with coronary artery disease.\nWe investigated whether PAD prevents the successful completion of CR and cardiac risk reduction and whether invasive treatment of claudicant patients who cannot walk sufficiently to successfully complete CR is indicated.\nThe records of 230 consecutive CR patients were reviewed for attendance, target heart rate, and Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) values to compare PAD among successes and failures. Failure of CR was defined as inability to walk sufficiently to achieve target heart rate. Markov decision analysis using published data for endovascular and open intervention for claudication was used to compare outcomes of treatment strategies in which PAD is untreated (current standard), PAD is treated only if it interfered with CR, and treatment of PAD in all patients before initiating CR.\nOf 230 patients, 126 had complete records for analysis. Ankle-brachial indices (ABIs) were documented for 39 patients. Overall, 40% of patients failed CR. Failure was significantly more common in patients with claudication (76%) than in those without (26%; odds ratio [OR], 8.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7-21.7; P < .001). The presence of PAD, determined by the WIQ walking distance score, was significantly higher in the failure group (34%) vs the success group (17%; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-6.0; P = .03). The presence of PAD, determined by ABI, was higher in the failure group (39%) vs the success group (14%; OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 0.8-17.9; P = .08). Logistic regression analysis when CR failure was adjusted for age and gender was significantly associated with presence of PAD based on WIQ walking distance score (OR, 2.8; 95% CI 1.1-7.1; P = .03). A strategy of invasive therapy only if PAD interfered with the successful completion of CR would save an additional 54 lives per 10,000 patients compared with no intervention.\nPAD is a significant cause of CR failure, preventing patients from successfully completing the program and achieving a reduction in risk of fatal cardiac events. Invasive treatment of PAD in patients who fail CR is indicated, with an expected lifesaving outcome.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease who require a lower-limb bypass have no available autologous saphenous vein (ASV) for the procedure and thus require a prosthetic graft. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts are commonly used, but results with these prostheses have varied, especially when the distal anastomosis is below the knee. However, there is increasing evidence that ePTFE grafts to which heparin has been bound with use of covalent endpoint linkage provide better results. This nonrandomized study compared the performance of these grafts with that of ASV conduits in the largest clinical series of heparin-bonded ePTFE graft implantations reported so far.\nThe records of 350 patients who underwent a lower-limb bypass procedure that used either a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft (n = 240) or an ASV graft (n = 110) were reviewed, and preoperative, operative, and follow-up data were recorded. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to calculate primary patency and limb salvage rates in the two graft groups; results were compared by using log-rank testing.\nThe primary patency rates at 1 year for the heparin-bonded ePTFE grafts were 92% for above-knee femoropopliteal (AK FP) bypasses, 92% for below-knee femoropopliteal (BK FP) bypasses, and 79% for femorocrural (FC) applications. The corresponding 2-year rates were 83%, 83%, and 69%, respectively. In the ASV group, the 1-year primary patency rates for AK FP, BK FP, and FC bypasses were 91%, 72%, and 69%, respectively; the 2-year rates were 80%, 72%, and 64%, respectively. There were no significant differences in patency when AK FP, BK FP, or FC procedures were considered separately. Two-year limb salvage rates in the heparin-bonded ePTFE graft group were 92%, 98%, and 87%, respectively, for AK FP, BK FP, and FC bypasses; in the ASV group, the rates were 100%, 91%, and 96%, respectively. Two infections occurred in patients given a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft.\nIn this large retrospective study, heparin-bonded ePTFE grafts had 1- and 2-year primary patency results that were not significantly different from those for ASV grafts. Results in BK FP and FC applications were especially promising. Randomized studies comparing the use of heparin-bonded ePTFE and ASV grafts in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease are needed to substantiate our results.",

A novel, precuffed expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft that was designed for AK femoropopliteal bypass (Dynaflo, Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc, Tempe, Ariz) has been available for clinical use since March 2005, promising better patency rates by optimizing the hemodynamic patterns within the distal anastomosis.\nA prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study was performed to investigate the clinical results of the Dynaflo graft. Primary end points were patency rates, limb salvage, and complications.\nBetween March 2005 and August 2007, the Dynaflo graft was used in 135 AK bypasses in 134 patients (110 men) with a mean age of 66 years. Indication for revascularization was claudication in 99 (73%) and critical ischemia in 36 (27%). With a mean follow-up of 18 months the 6-, 12- and 24-month primary patency rates were 90%, 83% and 72.5% and the secondary patency rates were 93%, 88.6% and 82.2%, respectively. The cumulative limb salvage rate at 24 months was 95%. Complications were observed in 39 patients (29%), with bypass failure (29 cases) and significant thrombus accumulation at the distal anastomosis (4 cases) being the most severe.\nThis study presents the first clinical results of a novel ePTFE graft for supragenicular revascularization. The implantation of the Dynaflo graft seems to be safe and feasible for AK bypass, achieving acceptable medium-term patency rates. Nevertheless, long-term results have to be awaited, and prospective comparative studies are warranted.",

The investigations took place within 3 days. A t3D MRA was performed using a 3 Tesla whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) system with an eight-element phased-array coil. Image quality and diagnostic findings were subjectively analyzed by two radiologists and one vascular surgeon. Each distal calf and foot was divided into six arterial segments for DSA and t3D MRA, and four segments were investigated by US scan. Patency or occlusion was studied with all the techniques, whereby DSA and t3D MRA were additionally evaluated in patients having greater or less than 50% stenosis. Finally, images were visually assessed by the three observers by applying a six-point grading scale. The acquired data was statistically analyzed using McNemar's test and Wilcoxon's matched-pairs signed-rank sum test. The P values of less than an alpha level of .05 were considered to be statistically significant.\nWe achieved MRA images of diagnostic quality in all patients. Significantly more patent pedal arteries were identified by applying t3D MRA than DSA (P < .001) and US scan (P < .02). For estimating the degree of stenosis, no technique proved to be superior (P > .28). Overall image quality was rated best for t3D MRA. Additionally, potential bypass target vessels could be clearly discriminated from pedal veins due to the temporal resolution.\nIn our prospective study, t3D MRA has been proven to be superior to DSA and US scan in pedal vasculature imaging in critical limb ischemia. This is a valuable, noninvasive method for detecting potential pedal bypass target arteries.",

    "abstract": "Functional popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (FPAES) is an uncommon overuse injury in young physically active adults manifest by neuromuscular symptoms (gastroc/soleus cramping, plantar paresthesias). It is commonly confused with chronic recurrent exertional compartment syndrome (CRECS). This study evaluated the diagnostic testing, mechanism of injury, and treatment differences between FPAES and CRECS.\nBetween 1987 and 2007, 854 patients (557 women, 297 men; mean age, 28.5 years) were surgically treated for the diagnosis of CRECS or FPAES, or both. Compartment pressures were measured in all patients who had anterior lateral or posterior superficial calf symptoms (normal pressure <or=15 mm Hg). Noninvasive stress positional plethysmography was routine. Stress positional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or angiography (MRA) was performed on patients with positive plethysmography result and symptoms consistent with FPAES.\nOf the 854 patients, 757 (95%) had elevated compartment pressures (>or=25 mm Hg), and fasciectomy was performed for CRECS under local anesthesia (anterior lateral, 508; posterior superficial, 191; distal deep posterior, 101). The result of stress plethysmography was positive in 139 (18%), but they were asymptomatic. Forty-three patients (27 women, 16 men; mean age, 26.6 years) had positive stress plethysmography, appropriate FPAES symptoms, and normal compartment pressures. MRA/MRI in all 43 demonstrated normal musculotendinous anatomy and lateral neurovascular compression with plantar flexion. Under general anesthesia, all had excision of the soleal band, with relief from symptoms. In 19 of the 43 FPAES patients (44%), CRECS releases were done before or after FPAES surgery. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 240 months.\nFPAES and CRECS occur in the same population with similar symptoms but require different treatment.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is rapidly increasing in prevalence and is associated with carotid plaque development and is a risk factor for stroke. The aim of this study is to describe the outcomes for patients with MetS after carotid revascularization (carotid endarterectomy [CEA] and carotid stenting [CAS]).\nA database of patients undergoing carotid revascularization for primary atherosclerotic lesions was queried from 1996 to 2006. MetS was defined as the presence of >or=3 of the following criteria: blood pressure >or=130 mm Hg/>or=90 mm Hg; Triglycerides >or=150 mg/dL; high-density lipoproteins (HDL) <or=50 mg/dL for women and <or=40 mg/dL for men; fasting blood glucose >or=110 mg/dL; or Body Mass Index (BMI) >or=30 kg/m(2). Multivariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to outcomes. The average follow-up period was 4.5 years. A major adverse event (MAE) was defined as the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death.\nA total of 921 patients (mean age: 71 +/- 10 years; 64% male) underwent 750 CEAs and 171 CAS. Thirty-one percent were identified as having MetS, 48% were asymptomatic, 87% had hypertension, 27% had hyperlipidemia, 32% were considered diabetic, and 14% had chronic renal insufficiency. The morbidity and mortality rates for all patients were 16.9% and 1.1%, respectively. The 30-day combined stroke/death rate was 3.6%. The 30-day MAE rates were: 6.7% vs 3.3% for MetS vs No-MetS (P = .02). The 90-day MAE rates were 8.7% vs 4.9% for MetS vs No-MetS (P = .03). MetS patients were more likely to experience a complication than No-MetS patients (23% vs 14%, P = .001). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no difference between MetS and No-MetS patients with respect to patency, restenosis, re-intervention, or survival, but a difference existed for freedom from stroke, MI, and MAE. The difference between stroke rates was maintained between MetS and No-MetS, when subgrouped by those with and without symptoms. For patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), those with MetS had a 68% and 410% higher risk of developing an MAE and MI, respectively. However, for patients without diabetes, MetS was not significantly associated with MAE, stroke, or MI. No factors were found to be significantly associated with risk of stroke in all cases (in all patients, patients with diabetes, and patients without diabetes).\nMetS is prevalent among patients undergoing carotid revascularization. MetS patients are at a greater risk for perioperative morbidity as well as stroke, MI, and MAE during follow-up when compared to patients without MetS. Long-term stroke prevention is poor in the presence of MetS. MetS should be considered a significant risk factor for patients undergoing carotid revascularization.",

    "abstract": "To analyze early and mid-term outcome of endovascular treatment in patients with iliac aneurysms, comparing the results of hypogastric revascularization by branch endografting with those of hypogastric occlusion.\nConsecutive patients with iliac aneurysms receiving side branch endograft (Group I) were compared with those receiving endograft with hypogastric exclusion (Group II) during the interval from January 2000 to May 2008. Procedural details and outcomes were prospectively collected and were analyzed at one year to avoid mismatch in follow-up length.\nA total of 74 patients (mean age, 75.8 years, 95% males) were treated: 32 in Group I and 42 in Group II. No differences in baseline risk factors and aneurysm diameter (40.2 +/- 7.9 mm in Group I vs. 38.4 +/- 10.8 in Group II) were found. Concurrent treatment of aortic aneurysm was performed in 25/32 (78%) of Group I and 36/42 (86%) of Group II. Fluoro time was 48 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 31-57) in Group I vs. 31 minutes (IQR 23-38) in Group II (P = .04). The amount of contrast was similar in both Groups: 184 ml (IQR 155-210) in Group I vs. 183 ml (IQR 155-200) in Group II. No intestinal ischemia or deaths occurred. There were no significant differences in failures of hypogastric side branch deployment (2/32) compared with hypogastric coiling (3/42). Limb occlusions all occurring in the external iliac artery side were 2/32 in Group I vs. 3/42 in Group II. Reintervention rates were similar (5/32 vs. 4/42) at one year. Shrinkage of 5 mm or more was detected in 7/23 (30%) of Group I and in 13/37 (34%) of Group II. Iliac endoleak was present in eight patients (19%) in Group II and in one patient in Group I (4%) (P = .1). Similarly, buttock claudication or impotence were more frequent after hypogastric exclusion, recorded in eight patients in Group II and in one patient in Group I (P = .1).\nEndovascular treatment of iliac aneurysm with hypogastric revascularization through side branched endografts is feasible and safe in the mid-term. When compared with hypogastric embolization, this option leads to similar technical success and reintervention rates. Endoleak and buttock claudication occur frequently in patients with iliac aneurysm treated with hypogastric exclusion, while are uncommon in those with hypogastric revascularization. Side branch endografting for iliac aneurysm may be considered a primary choice in younger, active patients with suitable anatomy, but larger studies and longer postoperative observation periods are needed.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the inflammatory and coagulopathic response after endovascular thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair and to evaluate the effect of the response on postoperative renal function.\nFrom July 2005 to June 2008, 42 patients underwent elective endovascular repair of a TAAA using custom designed multi-branched stent-grafts at a single academic institution. Four patients were excluded from the analysis. White blood cell count (WBC), platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and creatinine were measured in all patients. In the last nine patients, interleukin-6 (IL-6), protein C, Factor V, d-dimers, cystatin C, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels were also measured. Change in lab values were expressed as a percentage of baseline values.\nThe 30-day mortality rate was 5% (2/38). All patients (n = 38) had a higher WBC (mean +/- SD: 139 +/- 80%, P < .0001), lower platelet count (56 +/- 15%, P < .0001), and higher PT (median: 17%, Interquartile range (IQR) 12%-22%, P < .0001) after stent-graft insertion. Twelve of 38 patients (32%) developed postoperative acute renal insufficiency (>50% rise in creatinine). Patients with renal insufficiency had significantly larger changes in WBC (178 +/- 100% vs 121 +/- 64%, P = .04) and platelet count (64 +/- 17% vs 52 +/- 12%, P = .02) compared with those without renal insufficiency. All patients (n = 9) had significant increases in NGAL (182 +/- 115%, P = .008) after stent-graft insertion. Six of nine patients (67%) had increased cystatin C (35 +/- 43%, P = .04) after stent-graft insertion, with a greater rise in those with postoperative renal insufficiency (87 +/- 32% vs 8 +/- 13%, P = .02). IL-6 levels were markedly increased in all patients (n = 9) after repair (9840 +/- 6160%, P = .008). Protein C (35 +/- 10%, P = .008) and Factor V levels (28 +/- 20%, P = .008) were uniformly decreased, while d-dimers were elevated after repair in all patients (310 +/- 213%, P = .008).\nLeukocytosis and thrombocytopenia were uniform following endovascular TAAA repair, and the severity of the response correlated with post-operative renal dysfunction. Elevation of a sensitive marker of renal injury (NGAL) suggests that renal injury may occur in all patients after stent-graft insertion.",

We report a 10-year experience with a hybrid approach to thoracoabdominal aortic pathology.\nRecords of all patients undergoing a combined endovascular and surgical approach to thoracoabdominal aortic pathology were reviewed. Presenting symptoms, perioperative morbidity and mortality, sequence (single versus two stages), and late results were analyzed.\nFrom 1998 to 2008, 20 patients were treated with hybrid repairs for thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) (15; four with dissection), aortic arch aneurysm (two), symptomatic supravisceral abdominal aortic aneurysm (one), contained perirenal pseudoaneurysm rupture (one), and floating aortic arch thrombus with cerebral and renal emboli in one patient. Ten patients had prior aortic grafting, one patient had a functional renal transplant, and all patients were considered high risk based on preoperative comorbidities. Aneurysm related pain (11) or aneurysm growth (eight), mesenteric ischemic symptoms (four), and peripheral embolization (one) were indications for intervention. Spinal catheter drainage was used routinely. The procedure was completed in a single stage (13), or two stages using a subcutaneous conduit constructed at the first stage (six). One patient refused the second stage and expired from aneurysm rupture five months later. There were nine major complications in six patients (32% morbidity); all recovered except one patient with complete aortic coverage from left subclavian to bifurcation in the single stage group who developed paraplegia (one of 15 patients at risk; 6.6%). There was no perioperative mortality (0-30 days or discharge). Two patients had successful re-intervention for a type I (included as a major complication) and II endoleak respectively. Two type II endoleaks without aneurysm growth continue under observation. There has been no graft thrombosis, aneurysm growth, or rupture during a mean follow-up of 16.6 months (range, 1-119 months) in 19 patients with a completed procedure (none lost to follow up). Cumulative survival at two years is 76%.\nA combined endovascular and surgical approach to thoracoabdominal aortic pathology can be performed in high-risk patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality. A two-stage approach is preferable when extensive coverage of the aorta is necessary and a subcutaneous conduit simplifies the second stage. Follow-up of 10 years in our initial patient suggests that this approach can be durable. Additional experience and longer follow-up is needed before expanding current indications for this approach.",

Ten patients had prior aortic grafting, one patient had a functional renal transplant, and all patients were considered high risk based on preoperative comorbidities. Aneurysm related pain (11) or aneurysm growth (eight), mesenteric ischemic symptoms (four), and peripheral embolization (one) were indications for intervention. Spinal catheter drainage was used routinely. The procedure was completed in a single stage (13), or two stages using a subcutaneous conduit constructed at the first stage (six). One patient refused the second stage and expired from aneurysm rupture five months later. There were nine major complications in six patients (32% morbidity); all recovered except one patient with complete aortic coverage from left subclavian to bifurcation in the single stage group who developed paraplegia (one of 15 patients at risk; 6.6%). There was no perioperative mortality (0-30 days or discharge). Two patients had successful re-intervention for a type I (included as a major complication) and II endoleak respectively. Two type II endoleaks without aneurysm growth continue under observation. There has been no graft thrombosis, aneurysm growth, or rupture during a mean follow-up of 16.6 months (range, 1-119 months) in 19 patients with a completed procedure (none lost to follow up). Cumulative survival at two years is 76%.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate that a modern theory of paraplegia prevention in thoracoabdominal aortic (TAAA) surgery is primarily non-anatomic and derives from experimentally validated interventions that prolong the ischemic tolerance, reduce reperfusion injury, and enhance the collateral perfusion of the spinal cord with or without assisted circulation.\nUsing an accurate predictive model (r(2) > 0.95) for paraplegia risk we studied the effects of protective strategies in 82 clinical series reporting more than 15,000 patients treated from 1985 to 2008. The observed/expected (O/E) ratios were calculated for each series and the results were grouped by technique. The effect of interventions such as spinal fluid drainage (SFD), systemic hypothermia, epidural cooling, and naloxone on O/E ratios were studied. We analyzed changes in O/E ratios from Era 1 (1985 to 1997) to Era 2 (1997 to 2008) and within treatment techniques over time.\nThe mean O/E ratio for paraplegia for all patients declined from 1.13 in Era 1 to 0.26 in Era 2. Adding SFD to patients treated with assisted circulation (AC) decreased the O/E ratio from 1.03 to 0.24 (P < .0001). Adding SFD to patients treated with aortic clamping without AC (XCL) decreased O/E from 0.91 to 0.23 (P = .0013). O/E for hypothermic arrest (HA) declined from 0.42 to 0.14 with SFD. The addition of SFD to AC, XCL, and HA accounted for most of the decline in O/E between Eras. Other factors which played a less defined but important role in the decline in O/E ratios were attention to higher mean arterial pressures (MAPs), more hypothermia, and neurochemical protection.\nParaplegia causation is anatomic but paraplegia prevention is physiologic (non-anatomic). We demonstrate that by using hypothermia, SFD, and increasing MAP, clinicians had similar improvements in paraplegia, reducing O/E deficit ratios from 1.03 to as low as 0.16, with or without intercostal reimplantation, and whether or not assisted circulation was used. Understanding the fundamental principles of paraplegia prevention and how to apply protective strategies leads to a reduction in paralysis in clinical series with or without the use of assisted circulation. This modern theory of paraplegia has significant implications for the rapidly advancing field of TAAA repair with branched endografts where the same principles apply.",

All patients who were treated with endovascular repair (n = 58) or open surgery (n = 143) were included. The GAS was calculated for each patient. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used to indicate discriminative ability. We tested for interactions between risk factors and the procedure performed. The GAS was updated to predict 30-day mortality after endovascular repair or open surgery in patients with ruptured AAAs using logistic regression analysis.\nThirty-day mortality was 15/58 (26%) for patients treated with endovascular repair and 57/143 (40%) for patients treated with open surgery (P = .06). The AUC for GAS was 0.69. No relevant interactions were found. The updated prediction rule (AUC = 0.70) can be calculated with the following formula: + 7 for open surgery + age in years + 17 for shock + 7 for myocardial disease + 10 for cerebrovascular disease + 14 for renal insufficiency.\nWe showed limited discriminative ability of the GAS and therefore updated the GAS by adding the type of procedure performed.

This report presents a case of an early proximal collapse of an endoprosthesis in an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The complication was diagnosed during the first month of follow-up and was not associated with any endoleak. It was treated with the deployment of a proximal endograft cuff with suprarenal fixation. Endograft collapse may complicate endovascular repair of the abdominal aorta in rare situations. Upon diagnosis of the problem, endovascular repair of graft collapse seems to be feasible.",

To our knowledge, we report the 25th and 26th cases of C septicum aortitis in the English literature and make recommendations for its management. The first patient was a 75-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed the presence of periaortic gas. He underwent aortic d\u00e9bridement and extra-anatomic bypass after blood cultures revealed C septicum. Four months after the initial presentation, he was readmitted with lethargy, found to have recurrent periaortic gas, and died. The second patient was a 76-year-old woman who presented with a 5-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with surrounding retroperitoneal gas. She underwent emergency aortic ligation and retroperitoneal d\u00e9bridement. Her blood and intraoperative tissue cultures also grew C septicum. She had a prolonged postoperative course and ultimately died on hospital day 94. Both patients were found to have concurrent colon adenocarcinomas. C septicum aortitis is a lethal disease that necessitates prompt surgical intervention and appropriate antibiotic therapy. The strong association of C septicum with occult malignancy should prompt the astute clinician to undertake an exhaustive search for a neoplastic process.",

    "abstract": "The safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in patients with previous history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has not been determined.\nFrom April 2003 to June 2006, 274 patients (68% women; mean age, 60 years +/- 15 years) underwent 293 consecutive RFA procedures. In the first 15 months, the temperature probe was maintained at 85 degrees C, with a pullback rate of 2 cm/min (85 limbs, 30%); we subsequently changed the protocol to 90 degrees C and a pullback rate of 2 to 3 cm/min (205 limbs, 70%). We identified 29 patients (10%) with a history of DVT or duplex scan evidence of post-thrombotic venous disease; these were compared with the remaining 264 (90%). Postprocedural acute thrombotic (AT) events were analyzed. By the CEAP classification, 204 limbs (70%) were C(2) to C(4), and 89 (30%) were C(5) to C(6). Thirty-seven patients (13%) had a history of superficial thrombophlebitis (SVT). Proximal mean GSV diameter was 0.95 +/- 0.29 cm (range, 0.4-2.3 cm). Concomitant procedures included avulsion phlebectomy in 88 limbs (30%) and perforator vein surgery in 4 (1%).\nAT events after RFA were detected in 38 limbs (13%), including thrombus protrusion into the sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) in 24 (8%), common femoral vein in 7 (2.5%), and calf vein DVT in 7 (2.5%). Overall incidence of AT events in limbs with and without evidence of previous DVT was 7% (2 of 29) and 14% (36 of 264), respectively (P = .36). Variables significantly associated with AT events were previous SVT (10 of 37 [27%] vs 28 of 256 [11%], P = .01), a larger GSV diameter (mean 1.1 +/- .39 vs 0.93 +/- 0.27, P < .01), and first protocol (catheter temperature of 85 degrees C with a slower pullback rate in 18 of 88 [20%] vs 20 of 205 [9.7%], P = .02). Concomitant venous operations were associated with an increase in AT events (23% vs 9%; P < .002). By multivariate analysis, larger proximal GSV diameter and previous SVT remained independently statistically significant (P = .049 and P = .0135, respectively). All AT patients were successfully treated with standard anticoagulation. No pulmonary emboli occurred.\nRFA of the GSV in patients with previous venous thromboembolic events is safe and should be offered as an alternative to surgical procedures. These data demonstrate that AT events increase when larger-diameter GSVs are treated.",

Specifically, in VV patients, the prevalences of no, single, and multiple thrombophilias were 33%, 52%, and 15%, respectively, compared with 63%, 26%, and 11% in VV controls. In CVU patients, the prevalences of no, single, and multiple thrombophilias was 26%, 30%, and 44%, respectively, compared with 66%, 22%, and 11% in CVU controls. Compared with controls, only factor XI levels were significantly higher in VV patients, and homocysteine and factor VIII, IX, and XI levels were all significantly higher in CVU patients.\nPatients with VV, and particularly CVU, have significantly higher prevalences of single and multiple thrombophilias than age- and sex-matched controls without clinical or duplex evidence of lower limb venous disease. These data support the hypothesis that thrombophilia predisposes to the development of superficial and deep lower limb venous reflux, and so VV and CVU, through the increased occurrence of clinical and subclinical thrombosis.",

Patient demographic data, length of stay, hospital charges, patient disposition, and mortality were examined. Where appropriate, univariate tests of association used the chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality, complications, and discharge status.\nA total of 1030 patients underwent open TAA repair and 267 underwent TEVAR. There was no significant difference in mortality between OAR and TEVAR (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-2.12), although OAR patients were more likely to have cardiac, respiratory, and hemorrhagic complications.

    "abstract": "Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in octogenarians is considered to have higher risks of mortality and systemic complications compared with younger patients. The purpose of our work is to present our experience with total laparoscopic repair for AAA in this subset of patients.\nFrom February 2002 to February 2008, 29 octogenarian patients underwent total laparoscopic AAA repair. Median age was 82 years (range, 80-85 years). Median aneurysm size was 52 mm (range, 40-85 mm). Disease was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) class II in 12 patients and class III in 17 patients. Ten patients presented with past medical history of myocardial infarct (34.5%).\nWe implanted 12 tube grafts and 17 bifurcated grafts. Twenty-six procedures were totally laparoscopic (89.6 %). Median operative time and aortic clamping time were 280 min (range, 160-480 min) and 75 min (range, 22-125 min), respectively. Two patients with juxtarenal AAA underwent suprarenal clamping. Median blood loss was 1100 cc (range, 600-3000 cc). Four patients (13.8%) needed adjunctive vascular procedures because of intraoperative complications. Two patients died in the postoperative course (6.9%). Four patients developed severe systemic non-lethal complications (14.8%, pneumopathies). Mild or moderate systemic complications were observed in 14 patients (51.8%) including transient renal insufficiencies without dialysis (13) and cardiac arrhythmia (1). Postoperative creatinine levels returned to baseline before discharge in all patients. Liquid diet was reintroduced after a median duration of 2 days (range, 1-10 days) and most patients were ambulatory by day four (range, 3-30 days). Median stays in intensive care unit and hospital were 72 hours (range, 12-1368 hours) and 11 days (range, 6-74 days), respectively. Sixteen patients (59.2%) were discharged directly to home with complete recovery. After a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 2-48 months), 23 patients are still alive and regained their baseline status. Four patients died after hospital discharge of non-vascular etiologies.\nTotal laparoscopic AAA repair is a worthwhile but challenging procedure in octogenarians. Laparoscopy is complementary to open surgery and EVAR in this subset. These results encourage us to offer laparoscopic AAA repair in good surgical risk octogenarians.",

    "abstract": "Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) significantly reduces aneurysm-related death. In January 2007, the Federal government enacted Medicare coverage guideline to screen persons at risk for the presence of an AAA, the Screen for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently (SAAAVE) Act. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and costs of a large scale screening effort for identifying AAAs in patients in clinical practice.\nA regional veterans affairs mandate for screening for AAA was implemented in February 2007. Data were extracted through the Northern California Veterans Affairs (VA) Service Network to identify veteran males 65-75 years of age who ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. An AAA was defined as an aortic diameter 3.0 cm or greater. A Decision Support Systems software (LumiData, Minneapolis, Minn) package tracked true costs of conducting a large AAA screening protocol in the Northern California VA Health Care System.\nA total of 2918 patients (average age, 71 +/- 6 years) were screened for AAA over a 1-year period from February 2007 to February 2008. An AAA was diagnosed in 5.1% (148/2918) of patients. Two hundred ninety patients out of the 2918 (9.9%) were inappropriately screened. The aneurysm distribution was as follows: 83% (123/148) of the aneurysms were 3.0-4.4 cm, 13% (19/148) were 4.5-5.5 cm, and 4.1% (6/148) were greater than 5.5 cm. Incidental findings of isolated iliac artery aneurysms were found in 0.1% (3/2918) of patients. The cost of AAA screening per patient is $53.\nThe results of a large AAA screening effort in clinical practice reflect the results reported in the major clinical trials at a reasonable cost.

    "abstract": "Nutcracker syndrome is a rare entity caused by extrinsic compression on the left renal vein as it crosses between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. It can clinically present with flank pain and hematuria. Accepted treatments include open vascular bypass procedures or endoluminal stenting. We present the first description, to our knowledge, of a laparoscopic splenic vein-left renal vein bypass to relieve the outflow obstruction. The patient, a 29-year-old woman with debilitating left flank pain, presented with nutcracker syndrome. Left renal vein outflow was obstructed at the level of the intersection between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. The option of laparoscopic splenic to left renal vein bypass was discussed and performed. A five-port transperitoneal approach was used. Meticulous vascular control was achieved with numerous laparoscopic vascular bulldog clamps. With completely intracorporeal suturing techniques, the splenic vein was anastomosed to the superior aspect of the anterior left renal vein. Total warm ischemia time was 37 minutes. The anastomosis was watertight immediately upon unclamping. Interestingly, upon unclamping, the luminal diameter of the splenic vein appeared to increase to twice its native diameter. The proximal left renal vein appeared less distended, indicating preferential venous outflow through the newly created venous bypass. Blood loss was minimal, no intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred, and the patient's symptoms improved. This report continues to augment the indications for laparoscopic surgery in even complex, urologic vascular situations.",

    "abstract": "True abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in patients with Marfan syndrome is relatively rare because most aortic aneurysms in this disease are dissecting aneurysms in the thoracic area. Therefore, its clinical characteristics and long-term outcome are still unclear.\nWe examined six patients (3 men, 3 women) with Marfan syndrome who had a true AAA. These patients underwent surgical treatment from 1972 to 2004, and we investigated the clinical and histologic findings.\nThe patients were a median age of 45 years (range, 23-73 years) at the time of operation. The median maximum AAA diameter was 76 mm (range, 30-140 mm). Two AAAs ruptured, one of which had twice undergone stent graft insertion before open repair. There was one anastomotic aneurysm and three aortic dissections with additional repair. Marfan-related cardiac complications, all found perioperatively or postoperatively, comprised three patients with annuloaortic ectasia and four with aortic regurgitation. Three patients died, including one death during the operation. Only slight mural thrombus was seen at nonruptured AAAs, and each surgical specimen of aneurysmal wall demonstrated significant cystic medial necrosis in the tunica media.\nTrue AAAs in Marfan syndrome seemed to have several specific features, such as the tendency to occur in relatively young patients, lack of mural thrombus, and susceptibility to dissection and rupture, and the patients have poor life expectancy. Therefore, careful follow-up, keeping these features in mind, is important to treat Marfan syndrome patients with a true AAA.",

    "abstract": "About a quarter of peripheral vein grafts fail due in part to intimal hyperplasia. The proliferative capacity and response to growth inhibitors of medial smooth muscle cells and adventitial fibroblasts in vitro were studied to test the hypothesis that intrinsic differences in cells of vein grafts are associated with graft failure.\nCells were grown from explants of the medial and adventitial layers of samples of vein grafts obtained at the time of implantation. Vein graft patency and function were monitored over the first 12 months using ankle pressures and Duplex ultrasound to determine vein graft status. Cells were obtained from veins from 11 patients whose grafts remained patent (non-stenotic) and from seven patients whose grafts developed stenosis. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) derived from media and fibroblasts derived from adventitia were growth arrested in serum-free medium and then stimulated with 1 muM sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), 10 nM thrombin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), PDGF-BB plus S1P, or PDGF-BB plus thrombin for determination of incorporation of [(3)H]-thymidine into DNA. Cells receiving PDGF-BB or thrombin were also treated with or without 100 microg/ml heparin, which is a growth inhibitor. Cells receiving thrombin were also treated with or without 150 nM AG1478, an EGF receptor kinase inhibitor.\nSMCs and fibroblasts from veins of patients that developed stenosis responded more to the growth factors, such as PDGF-BB alone or in combination with thrombin or S1P, than cells from veins of patients that remained patent (P = .012). In addition, while PDGF-BB-mediated proliferation of fibroblasts from grafts that remained patent was inhibited by heparin (P < .03), PDGF-BB-mediated proliferation of fibroblasts from veins that developed stenosis was not (P > .5).\nInherent differences in the proliferative response of vein graft cells to PDGF-BB and heparin may explain, in part, the variability among patients regarding long term patency of vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "To examine contemporary operative techniques and outcomes for repair of isolated iliac artery aneurysms.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent repair of an isolated iliac artery aneurysm from February 1995 to June 2007. Mycotic aneurysms and patients with concurrent infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms greater than 3.5 cm in diameter were excluded from analysis. Patients with prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were not excluded.\nFifty-six patients (96% male; mean age, 72 +/- 10 years) had either open (n = 24) or endovascular (n = 32) repair with median follow-up of 36 months. Seven patients were treated for rupture, six with open repair, and one with an endograft. Average aneurysm size for patients in the open and endovascular repair cohorts was 4.5 +/- 2.4 cm and 4.0 +/- 1.1 cm, respectively (P = .35). One episode of endograft limb thrombosis at five months was treated with catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy and stent placement. Thirty-day mortality for patients undergoing elective and emergent open repair was 1/18 (6%) and 1/6 (17%), respectively. There was no 30-day mortality for the endovascular group. Median length of stay was 10.5 days in the open group and one day in the endovascular elective group (P < .01). There was no mid-term aneurysm-related mortality in either group. Primary patency rates were similar between the open and endovascular groups at five years (100% vs. 96%, P = .07). Aneurysm sac diameter decreased in 67% (21/28) of patients that underwent endovascular repair. One patient with a Type III endoleak required relining of the endograft with a second endograft at 72 months.\nThese data demonstrate that in appropriately selected patients, endovascular repair of isolated iliac artery aneurysms is a safe, effective alternative to open repair with mid-term follow-up. Endovascular repair is associated with a significantly reduced hospital length of stay and may be associated with decreased need for transfusion and mortality when compared with open repair.",

    "abstract": "Compression therapy is the most widely used treatment for venous leg ulcers and it was used in different forms for more than 400 years. Published healing rates of venous ulcers obtained with compression therapy vary widely from 40-95%. According to numerous studies, it has been suggested that the application of external pressure to the calf muscle raises the interstitial pressure resulting in improved venous return and reduction in the venous hypertension. Several risk factors have been identified to be correlated with the failure of venous leg ulcers to heal with compression therapy (longer ulcer duration; large surface area; fibrinous deposition present on >50% of the wound surface and an Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) of <0.85.\nAn open prospective single-center study was performed in order to determine possible risk factors associated with the failure of venous ulcers to heal when treated with multi-layer high compression bandaging system for 52 weeks. In the study, 189 patients (101 women, 88 men; mean age 61 years) with venous leg ulcers (ulcer surface >5 cm(2); duration >3 months) were included. The study excluded patients with arterial disease (ABPI <0.8), heart insufficiency with ejection fraction (EF) <35, pregnancy, cancer disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes. Based on clinical opinion and available literature, the following were considered as potential risk factors: sex, age, ulceration surface, time since ulcer onset, previous operations, history of deep vein thrombosis, body mass index (BMI), reduction in calf circumference >3 cm during the first 50 days of treatment, walking distance during the day <200 meters, calf:ankle circumference ratio <1.3, fixed ankle joint, history of surgical wound debridement, >50% of wound covered with fibrin, depth of the wound >2 cm.\nWithin 52 weeks of limb-compression therapy, 24 (12.7%) venous ulcers had failed to heal. A small ulceration surface (<20 cm(2)), the duration of the venous ulcer <12 months, a decrease in calf circumference of more than 3 cm, and emergence of new skin islets on >10% of wound surface during the first 50 days of treatment were favorable prognostic factors for ulcer healing. A large BMI (>33 kg/m(2)), short walking distance during the day (<200 m), a history of wound debridement, and ulcers with deepest presentation (>2 cm) were indicators of slow healing. Calf:ankle circumference ratio <1.3, fixed ankle joint, and reduced ankle range of motion were the only independent parameters associated with non-healing (P < .001).\nThe results obtained in this study suggest that non-healing venous ulcers are related to the impairment of the calf muscle pump.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the outcome of adjunctive renal artery stenting for renal artery coverage at the time of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nBetween August 2000 and August 2008, 29 patients underwent elective EVAR using bifurcated Zenith stent grafts (Cook, Indianapolis, Ind) and simultaneous renal artery stenting. Renal artery stenting during EVAR was performed with endograft \"encroachment\" on the renal artery ostium (n = 23) or placement of a renal stent parallel to the main body of the endograft (\"snorkel,\" n = 8). Follow-up included routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), multiview abdominal radiographs, and serum creatinine measurement at 1, 6, and 12 months, and then yearly thereafter.\nThirty-one renal arteries were stented successfully in 29 patients. The 18 patients with planned renal artery stent placement had a proximal neck length <15 mm. Mean proximal neck length was shorter in patients who underwent the \"snorkel\" technique (6.9 +/- 3.1 mm) compared with those with planned endograft encroachment (9.9 +/- 2.6 mm). None of the patients with unplanned endograft encroachment had neck lengths <15 mm (mean length, 26.3 +/- 10.2 mm). Mean proximal neck angulation was 42.8 degrees +/- 24.0 degrees and did not differ between the groups. One patient had a type I endoleak on completion angiography, and two additional patients had a type I endoleak on the first postoperative CT scan. All type I endoleaks resolved by the 1-month postoperative CT scan. The primary assisted patency of renal artery stents was 100% at a median follow-up of 12.5 months (range, 2 days-77.4 months). In one patient near occlusion of a renal artery stent was noted on follow-up CT scan at 9 months; patency was restored by placement of an additional stent. One patient required dialysis after sustained hypotension from a right external iliac artery injury that resulted in prolonged postoperative bleeding. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 mg/dL at baseline, 1.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dL at 1 month of follow-up, and 1.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dL at 2 years of follow-up. There were no late type I endoleaks (>1 month postoperatively) or stent graft migrations.\nAdjunctive renal artery stenting during endovascular AAA repair using the \"encroachment\" and \"snorkel\" techniques is safe and effective. Short- and medium-term primary patency rates are excellent, but careful follow-up is needed to determine the durability of these techniques.",

    "abstract": "The selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist sarpogrelate has been clinically used for treatment in atherosclerotic diseases. However, it remains unknown whether administration of sarpogrelate inhibits intimal hyperplasia seen in autologous vein grafts. Therefore, we sought to clarify this question using an experimental rabbit vein graft model.\nMale rabbits were divided into two groups: a control group and a sarpogrelate-treated group. The jugular vein was interposed in the carotid artery in reversed fashion for 4 weeks and intimal hyperplasia of the grafted vein was measured (n = 8, in each group). Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was tested by precontraction with prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha), 5 muM) (n = 5, in each). endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and superoxide production of these veins were also assessed.\nThe suppression of intimal hyperplasia was significantly greater in the sarpogrelate-treated group than in the control group. ACh induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation in the sarpogrelate-treated group (but not in the control group). In endothelium-intact strips from the sarpogrelate-treated group, the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor nitroarginine enhanced the PGF(2alpha)-induced contraction and blocked the ACh-induced relaxation. Immunoreactive eNOS protein expression was similar between the two groups but superoxide production (estimated from ethidium fluorescence) in endothelial cells was significantly smaller in the sarpogrelate-treated group.\nThe present results indicate that in vivo blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors leads to an inhibition of intimal hyperplasia in rabbit vein graft. It is suggested that an increased function of endothelium-derived NO through a reduction in endothelial superoxide production may be a possible underlying mechanism for this. These novel findings support the clinical usefulness of sarpogrelate for preventing intimal hyperplasia in vein graft after bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "Choices for embolic protection during carotid stent procedures include distal filtration (DF) and proximal occlusion with flow reversal (POFR). DF devices are widely used but have produced only modest improvements in clinical outcomes. There is less experience with POFR devices but single center reports suggest reduced emboli detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD). To determine if POFR offers a significant improvement in embolic protection, we tested five DF devices and two POFR devices with 8F and 10F sheath design in an ex vivo angioplasty system using human carotid plaques excised en bloc. Physiologic pressures and flows were used and the efficiency of plaque fragment removal by these devices compared.\nThirty-three human carotid plaques removed en bloc were secured in tailored polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. The distal PTFE was either 6 mm or 5 mm inner diameter (ID). Saline was delivered through the excised carotid plaque as follows: a cleaning 50 mL flush was done prior to the angioplasty procedure and discarded; further flushes of forward flow were done with five pressurized \"pulsations\" of 10 mL each (50 mL), peak pressure 140 mm Hg. Balloon angioplasty was done with a 4 mm and then a 6 mm balloon. DF flushes were applied after each angioplasty and \"postprocedure\" after the device was removed. With POFR, 50 mL were collected through the sheath after balloon angioplasty by either back-pressure of 20 mm Hg, 40 mm Hg or 60 mm Hg, or by aspiration. Postangioplasty pressurized forward flush of 50 or 100 mL was done as described. Each flush was collected, centrifuged, and examined for plaque fragments. Fragments greater than 60 microns were sized and counted on a 100 micron grid.\nWhen DF devices were used in 6 mm lumen PTFE, the percent of fragments trapped was poor (13.7% to 27.8%). There were no statistically significant differences between the devices. The capture of fragments improved (22% vs 51.4%, P < .001) when devices appropriate for a 6 mm lumen were used in a 5 mm PTFE \"ICA\", functionally over-sizing the devices. POFR efficiency improved with increasing back-pressures and with repeated aspirations. Postprocedure, successive flushes of pressurized forward flow yielded additional plaque fragments and when the efficiency of POFR was assessed with forward flushing volumes similar to those used for DF, the efficiencies were similar, although larger fragments were more efficiently removed with POFR.\nIn our model, both protection strategies were less than ideal. For POFR, high back pressures or multiple aspirations improve the efficiency of cerebral protection but additional fragments were released by pressurized flow even after aspiration of 150 mL of saline. DF devices create a pressure gradient and fragments apparently went around the device with pressurized flow in our PTFE lumen. Over-sizing of DF devices partially corrected this problem and increased over all DF efficiency to be comparable to POFR for smaller fragments but not for larger fragments.",

    "abstract": "Accessing the distal internal carotid artery can be a challenge to even the most experienced vascular surgeon. In most patients, the need for distal exposure can be anticipated in advance, thereby enabling the surgeon to consider simple measures, such as nasolaryngeal intubation, or more complex interventions, such as temporomandibular subluxation, to facilitate access. Once the procedure is underway, however, neither of these strategies can be used. The advantage of the approach described in this article is that it can be used at any time during the operation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the relationship between immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 and idiopathic sclerosing lesions has attracted much attention. IgG4-related disease was first described with regard to the pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis), and has been expanded to various organ systems. We previously reported that inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA) could be one of the manifestations of IgG4-related disease. In this study, we tried to elucidate the clinical characteristics of IgG4-related IAAA.\nThis study consisted of 23 cases of IAAA and 40 cases of atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and pathological features were examined. Aneurysms of 13 cases histologically corresponded to IgG4-related IAAA.\nThose cases accounted for 5% of all surgical AAAs, and 57% of IAAAs. Compared to non-IgG4-related IAAA, IgG4-related cases were characterized by less frequent association with abdominal or back pain. Serum IgG4 concentrations were significantly elevated in IgG4-related cases. Interestingly, patients with IgG4-related IAAA frequently showed an allergic constitution, such as drug allergy, autoimmune diseases, high serum IgE concentrations, and a high titer of antinuclear antibody. Pathologically, IgG4-related cases were characterized by more significant thickening of the adventitia and more numerous IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrations. Three non-IgG4-related cases showed aneurysmal rupture at the time of first presentation, whereas no IgG4-related cases showed rupture.\nRecognizing a new disease entity of IgG4-related IAAA seems important because this was clinically and pathologically different from conventional aAAA and non-IgG4-related IAAA.",

    "abstract": "Cilostazol improves walking distance and quality of life in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study assessed the vascular and biochemical effects of cilostazol therapy in PAD patients.\nPAD patients were prospectively recruited to a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Baseline clinical data were recorded. Clinical assessment included measurement of arterial compliance, transcutaneous oxygenation, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and treadmill walking distance. Blood analyses included a full blood panel, coagulation screen, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lipid profiles. Quality of life indices were recorded using validated generic and walking-specific questionnaires. All tests were performed at baseline, 6, and 24 weeks.\nEighty patients (53 men) were recruited from December 2004 to January 2006. The cilostazol group had a significant reduction in the augmentation index compared with the placebo group at 6 weeks (19.7% vs 26.7%, P = .001) and at 24 weeks (19.7% vs 27.7%, P = .005). A paradoxic reduction in transcutaneous oxygenation levels was identified in the cilostazol group for the left foot at 6 weeks and for the right foot at both 6 and 24 weeks. The ABIs were not significantly different between treatment groups at baseline, 6 weeks, or 24 weeks for the left and right lower limbs. The mean percentage change in walking distance from baseline improved more markedly in the cilostazol compared with the placebo group for absolute claudication distance at 6 (78.6% vs 26.4%, P = .20) and 24 weeks (173.1% vs 92.1%, P = .27); however, these failed to reach significance. Significant improvements in lipid profiles were demonstrated with cilostazol therapy at 6 weeks (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and at 24 weeks (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein). The cilostazol treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in the Short Form-36 (physical functioning, physical component score), Walking Impairment (distance and speed), and Vascular Quality of Life (pain) indices at 6 and 24 weeks. Although cilostazol was associated with side effects in approximately one-third of patients, most settled within 6 weeks, facilitating the continuation of therapy in >89%.\nCilostazol is a well-tolerated, safe, and efficacious treatment for PAD patients. It not only improves patients' symptomatology and quality of life but also appears to have beneficial effects on arterial compliance, possibly through its lipid-lowering property.",

A paradoxic reduction in transcutaneous oxygenation levels was identified in the cilostazol group for the left foot at 6 weeks and for the right foot at both 6 and 24 weeks. The ABIs were not significantly different between treatment groups at baseline, 6 weeks, or 24 weeks for the left and right lower limbs. The mean percentage change in walking distance from baseline improved more markedly in the cilostazol compared with the placebo group for absolute claudication distance at 6 (78.6% vs 26.4%, P = .20) and 24 weeks (173.1% vs 92.1%, P = .27); however, these failed to reach significance. Significant improvements in lipid profiles were demonstrated with cilostazol therapy at 6 weeks (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and at 24 weeks (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein). The cilostazol treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in the Short Form-36 (physical functioning, physical component score), Walking Impairment (distance and speed), and Vascular Quality of Life (pain) indices at 6 and 24 weeks. Although cilostazol was associated with side effects in approximately one-third of patients, most settled within 6 weeks, facilitating the continuation of therapy in >89%.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular procedure volume has increased rapidly, and endovascular procedures have become the initial treatment option for many vascular diseases. Consequently, training in endovascular procedures has become an essential component of vascular surgery training. We hypothesized that, due to this paradigm shift, open surgical case volume may have declined, thereby jeopardizing training and technical skill acquisition in open procedures.\nVascular surgery trainees are required to log both open and endovascular procedures with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). We analyzed the ACGME database (2001-2007), which records all cases (by Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code) performed by graduating vascular trainees. Case volume was evaluated according to the mean number of cases performed per graduating trainee.\nThe mean number of total major vascular procedures performed per trainee increased by 174% between 2001 and 2007 (from 298.3 to 519.2). Endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic procedures increased by 422% (from 63.7 to 269.1) and accounted for 93.0% of the increase in total procedures. The number of open aortic procedures (aneurysm, occlusive, mesenteric, renal) decreased by 17.1% (from 49.7 to 41.2), while the number of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair procedures increased by 298.8% (from 16.9 to 50.5). Specifically, open aortic aneurysm procedures decreased by 21.8%, aortobifemoral bypass increased by 3.2%, and open mesenteric or renal procedures decreased by 13%. Infrainguinal bypass procedures remained relatively constant (from 37.6 to 36.5, 2.9% decrease), and the number of carotid endarterectomy procedures performed did not change significantly (from 43.6 to 42.2, 3.2% decrease).\nVascular surgery trainees are performing a vastly increased total number of procedures. This increase in total procedure volume is almost entirely attributable to the recent increase in endovascular procedures. Aside from a small decline in open aortic procedures, the volume of open surgical procedures has largely remained stable. It is essential that vascular surgery training programs continue to focus on both endovascular and open surgical skills in order for vascular surgeons to remain the premier specialists to care for patients with vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "This study used a large national administrative in-hospital database to compare utilization and age-specific outcomes between open repair (OAR) and endovascular (EVAR) repair for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nDischarges with the principal International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes for EVAR and OAR and principal diagnosis code of intact AAAs were selected from the 2001 to 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Weighted least-square regression was used to test the trend of utilization by age. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the risk-adjusted outcomes.\nNationally, the estimated number of elective AAAs treated with EVAR increased from 11,171 in 2001 to 21,725 in 2006 (P = .003). The number of elective AAAs treated with OAR declined from 17,784 to 8451 during the same period (P < .001). By 2006, EVAR was more frequently used than OAR for patients of all ages. Compared with the younger age groups, patients aged >or=85 years had a significant increase in the total number of asymptomatic AAA repairs, driven almost entirely by an increase in the use of EVAR. Compared with open patients, EVAR patients had a significantly shorter length of hospitalization (adjusted mean, 2.99 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.97-3.01] vs 8.78 days [95% CI, 8.53-8.57]), less in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.19-0.28), fewer in-hospital complications (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.25-0.28), and a higher likelihood of being discharged to home (OR, 3.95; 95% CI, 3.62-4.31). The reduction of complications from the use of EVAR versus OAR was most dramatic for the oldest patients.\nAs short-term surgical outcomes are consistently improving for patients undergoing AAA repair, elective EVAR has replaced OAR as the more common method of repair in the United States. The introduction of this technology has been rapidly adopted, particularly for the oldest-old surgical patients, aged >or=85 years, who previously may not have been offered surgical intervention for asymptomatic AAA. Further investigation is necessary to examine whether this trend improves the long-term survival and quality of life for this elderly population.",

Although risk increased with the number of variables, the model, based on clinical symptoms and on medical history parameters, was not discriminatory (AUC = 0.66).

All patients had computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging preoperatively and image postprocessing. The follow-up using CTA imaging specifically addressed material fatigue (wire form fractures) resulting in migrations and type I endoleaks.\nDuring the 6-year study period, which included the 1-year withdrawal and redesign of the device, 51 patients were treated with LifePath AAA endografts. The 30-day mortality was 0%. The perioperative 30-day morbidity was 9.8%. One patient required a primary conversion due to misdeployment of the iliac limbs within the graft main body. The primary endoleak rate was 20.56% (type I, 2%; type II, 19.6%). During the mean follow-up of 40.7 months, 12 patients died, six were lost to follow-up, and 32 underwent subsequent CTA imaging. Eight patients (25%) demonstrated a proximal type I endoleak, seven (22%) had a type II endoleak, and three had a type III endoleak (9%). In nine patients (28.1%), wire form fractures could be detected at image postprocessing. Four patients required a secondary conversion due to endoleak and aneurysm growth (2 type I endoleaks and 2 type III endoleaks).\nWire form fracture is the major structural problem in the LifePath balloon-expandable endograft device, resulting in a significant endoleak rate. We must caution those patients with a LifePath device in-situ that careful follow-up must be performed due to material fatigue and they should consider secondary conversion.",

The primary endoleak rate was 20.56% (type I, 2%; type II, 19.6%). During the mean follow-up of 40.7 months, 12 patients died, six were lost to follow-up, and 32 underwent subsequent CTA imaging. Eight patients (25%) demonstrated a proximal type I endoleak, seven (22%) had a type II endoleak, and three had a type III endoleak (9%). In nine patients (28.1%), wire form fractures could be detected at image postprocessing. Four patients required a secondary conversion due to endoleak and aneurysm growth (2 type I endoleaks and 2 type III endoleaks).",

    "abstract": "Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) is associated with a decreased incidence of perioperative cardiac complications compared with open repair. However, EVAR is not associated with long-term survival benefit. This study assessed the effect of perioperative asymptomatic cardiac damage after EVAR on long-term prognosis.\nIn 220 patients undergoing elective EVAR, routine sampling for levels of cardiac troponin T and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed on days 1, 3, and 7 during the patient's hospital stay. Elevated cardiac troponin T was defined as serum concentrations >or=0.01 ng/mL. Asymptomatic cardiac damage was defined as cardiac troponin T release without symptoms or ECG changes. The median follow-up was 2.9 years. Survival status was obtained by contacting the Office of Civil Registry.\nRelease of cardiac troponin T (median, 0.08 ng/mL) occurred in 24 of 220 patients, of whom 20 (83%) were asymptomatic and without ECG changes. Patients with asymptomatic cardiac damage had a mortality rate of 49% [corrected] after 2.9 years vs 15% [corrected] for patients without perioperative cardiac damage (P < .001). Also after adjustment for clinical risk factors and medication use applying multivariate Cox regression analysis, asymptomatic cardiac damage was associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk for death (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.1). Statin use was associated with a reduced long-term risk for death (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9).\nAsymptomatic cardiac damage in patients undergoing EVAR is associated with poor long-term outcome. Routine perioperative cardiac screening after EVAR might be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous splanchnic dissection (SSD) occurs infrequently and has a poorly defined natural history. Few studies address the application, timing, and consequences of therapeutic options. Our goal was to apply conservative (non-operative) management in the care of each patient, reserving interventions for specific indications that may be predictive of adverse outcomes.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, 10 consecutive patients (mean age 54.7-years-old, 70.0% male) presented with 11 SSDs involving either the celiac artery (n = 6), superior mesenteric artery (n = 3), or both (n = 1). Each patient had acute, spontaneous onset of persistent abdominal pain and was diagnosed with SSD following multidetector row computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Non-operative management (anticoagulation, anti-impulse therapy, analgesics, and serial CTA examinations) was initially used in 9 patients. Endovascular (n = 2) or operative (n = 2) intervention was performed either immediately (n = 1) or following failed medical management (n = 3) in 4 patients for specific indications that included persistent symptoms (n = 3), expansion of false lumen (n = 3), and/or radiologic malperfusion (n = 3).\nAll patients were asymptomatic after successful non-operative management or following intervention. No morbidity occurred. Upon complete follow-up (mean 13.4 months, range, 2 to 36 months), all patients remained asymptomatic. Preservation of distal perfusion with either thrombosis or ongoing regression of false lumen was achieved in 5 patients who received only non-operative management and in 4 patients following intervention. A stable chronic dissection was present in 1 patient who had only non-operative management.\nSuccessful outcomes following SSD may be achieved with either non-operative therapy alone or intervention if persistent symptoms, expansion of false lumen, and/or malperfusion occur. The unpredictable response of the false lumen to conservative management mandates close, long-term follow-up. Endovascular and operative interventions produced similar outcomes in a small number of patients with limited follow-up. Although SSD is currently perceived as rare, the increasing use of CTA may prove that the true incidence has been underestimated.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the number of endovascular procedures performed on the superficial femoral (SFA) and popliteal arteries (PA) has significantly increased. There is no consensus on the optimal form of intervention used in this arterial segment. While some have advocated balloon angioplasty alone, others have championed either selective or primary stenting of these lesions. It is the purpose of this study to determine the efficacy and durability of primary stenting of the superficial femoral and popliteal artery.\nAll patients undergoing peripheral angioplasty by a single vascular surgeon were prospectively enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved, primary-stenting protocol. During a 44-month period, all patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SFA or PA also received primary arterial stenting with bare, self-expanding nitinol stents. Patient demographics and risk factors were identified. TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) classifications were determined for all lesions. Loss of primary patency was said to have occurred when an occlusion or a 50% or greater stenosis in any treated arterial segment was diagnosed by arterial duplex or angiography. Only time to loss of primary patency was recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and differences between groups tested by log rank method.\nBetween January 16, 2004 and August 13, 2007, 201 angioplasties with primary stenting were performed on 161 patients. One hundred twenty-three stents were placed for claudication, and 78 for critical limb ischemia. Forty-six segments treated were TASC A, 82 were TASC B, 38 were TASC C, and 35 were TASC D. Patient follow-up ranged from three to 1329 days (mean: 426 days). Primary patency rates for TASC A and B lesions were 79%, 67%, and 57% at 12, 24, and 36 months. For TASC C and D lesions, primary patency rates were 52.7%, 36%, and 19% at the same time intervals. Primary patency rates for TASC A and B lesions were significantly higher than for C and D lesions (P < .001). The limb salvage rate was 88.5% in patients with critical limb ischemia. Distal runoff did not influence patency (P = .827).\nPrimary stenting of the SFA and PA provides durable results in patients with TASC A and B lesions and may be an effective treatment strategy. This approach is significantly less effective when used in treating those with TASC C and D disease. Based on the results in this series, the use of primary stenting does not extend the anatomic limits of the current treatment recommendations for catheter-based intervention in patients with infrainguinal occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is not uncommon, but in most patients the object passes without sequelae. In very few patients, the ingested foreign objects may perforate the gastrointestinal tract, causing potentially life-threatening complications. Pointed ingested objects such as toothpicks are the most common. Vascular perforation due to toothpick ingestion has rarely been reported. We present a patient with lower gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to simultaneous perforation of the sigmoid colon and the right iliac limb of an aortobiiliac endograft by an ingested toothpick. This arterioenteric fistula was treated in two stages. First as a bridging operation, a stent graft was inserted into the ipsilateral limb of the previous aortoiliac endograft to control the bleeding. Second, the aortoiliac endograft was removed, the aorta was oversewn, and an extra-anatomic axillobifemoral bypass restored the flow to the lower limbs. The colon perforation was treated with a proximal temporary loop colostomy. To our knowledge, this the first case of aortoiliac endograft-enteric fistula after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair caused by this extraordinary mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous ethanol sclerotherapy (PES) is the primary tool in the treatment of venous malformations (VM). However, PES has known serious complications. This study is aimed at identifying predictors of good response to PES in patients with VM to improve patient selection.\nWe performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study of 158 VM patients (mean age, 14.3 years, male 42%) who underwent ethanol sclerotherapy at a specialized vascular malformation center. For clinical result assessment, patients or parents in pediatric patients answered questions on symptomatic, functional, and cosmetic improvement after PES. In each category, the possible choices were markedly improved, moderately improved, no change, moderately worse, or markedly worse compared with pretreatment status. A \"good response\" was defined as one or more areas of marked improvement on the self-assessment in conjunction with marked improvement on post-treatment images (> or =30% decrease in maximal diameter of VM on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or > or =50% decrease in abnormal blood pool ratio on whole body blood pool scintigraphy [WBBPS] compared with pretreatment images). To determine predictors of a good response to PES, uni- and multivariate analysis were conducted on demographics (age, gender), clinical features of VM (location, size, depth of involved tissue, presence of associated lymphatic malformation, MRI findings; well-defined vs ill-defined margin, characteristics of venous drainage during PES) and treatment variables (number of PES sessions, maximal concentration and dosage of ethanol used in PES, adjuvant therapy).\nSymptomatic, functional, and cosmetic improvement was 28%, 27%, and 34%, respectively, based on patient questionnaires. Based on imaging studies, 42 patients (27%) had markedly improvement. Composite outcome combining questionnaire results and imaging study showed that 16% of patients had a \"good response\". On multivariate analysis, female gender (odds ratio [OR]: 4.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-16.28), no or delayed visualization of drainage vein (OR: 9.22, 95% CI: 1.79-47.51), and a well-defined margin on MRI (OR: 13.38, 95% CI: 2.84-63.12) were independent predictors of \"good response\" to PES.\nPES should be performed in selected patients in order to obtain the best outcomes and minimize complications. No or delayed visualization of drainage vein on initial direct puncture venogram, a well-defined margin on MRI, and female gender were statistically significant predictors of a \"good response\" to PES and may be useful in selecting patients.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) are inflammatory cells present in atherosclerotic lesions and neovascularized tissues. Recently, MCs were shown to modulate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation in a mouse model. Progression of aneurysmatic disease process may also depend on intraluminal thrombus and neovascularization of the aneurysm wall. Here we investigated the relationship between MCs and inflammation, neovascularization, and the presence of intraluminal thrombus in human AAA.\nSpecimens from AAAs and normal control aortas were analyzed with basic histology, immunohistochemical staining, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Double immunostainings with endothelial cell markers CD31/CD34 and MC tryptase showed that, in contrast to histologically normal aorta, MCs in AAA were abundant in the media, but absent from the intima. Medial MCs and (CD31/CD34)(+) neovessels increased significantly in AAA compared with normal aorta (P < .0001 for both), and the highest densities of neovessels and MCs were observed in the media of thrombus-covered AAA samples. Also, the proportional thickness of aortic wall penetrated by the neovessels was significantly higher in the AAA samples (P < .0001), and the neovascularized area correlated with the density of medial MCs (P < .0001). In histologic analysis, the medial MCs were mainly located adjacent to the stem cell factor (SCF)(+) medial neovessels. Real-time PCR analysis also showed that mRNA levels of genes associated with neovascularization (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], FLT1, VE-cadherin, CD31), and MCs (tryptase, chymase, cathepsin G) were higher in AAA samples than in controls. Demonstration of adhered platelets by CD42b staining and lack of endothelial cell (CD31/CD34) staining in the luminal surface of AAA specimens suggest endothelial erosion of the aneurysm walls.\nThe results support participation of MCs in the pathogenesis of AAA, particularly regarding neovascularization of aortic wall.",

    "abstract": "The role of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in the management of acute type B aortic dissection remains undefined. Entry tear coverage during the acute phase is an appealing method to treat acute complications, and by inducing false lumen thrombosis, might also prevent late aneurysm formation. This study evaluated structural changes by serial computed tomography (CT) in the thoracic aorta after TEVAR performed for acute complicated aortic dissection.\nBetween August 2005 and October 2007, 33 patients with complicated acute type B aortic dissection were treated with TEVAR (19 from a prospective industry sponsored trial, 14 from our institution). CT images obtained preprocedurally (PP), at 1 month (1M), and 1 year (1Y) were evaluated for each patient. Four patients with no postprocedural imaging were excluded. The largest diameters of the thoracic aorta, dissection true lumen, and false lumen were recorded at each time point. Changes in total aortic and true and false lumen diameters were evaluated using a mixed effect analysis of variance model of repeated measures.\nThe average age was 58 years (range, 38-87 years); 26 (81%) were male. Indications for TEVAR included malperfusion syndrome in 17 (53%), refractory hypertension in 14 (44%), impending rupture in 12 (28%), and refractory pain in 14 (44%); 19 (59%) had more than one indication. The average length of aorta covered was 19.5 cm (range, 10-29.3 cm). The maximum aortic diameter decreased over time (P = .04) and averaged 39.9 (PP), 41.3 (1M), and 34.8 mm (1Y). The true lumen diameter increased over time (P = .02) and averaged 23.7 (PP), 29.0 (1M), and 31.1 mm (1Y). The false lumen diameter decreased (P = .046) and averaged 19.5 (PP), 12.1 (1M), and 9.6 mm (1Y). Partial or complete thrombosis of the false lumen along the stented segment of aorta was recorded in 87% (PP), 93% (1M), and 88% (1Y).\nTEVAR of acute complicated aortic dissection appears to promote early aortic remodeling. Nearly 90% of patients maintained at least partial false lumen thrombosis at 1 year. Because continued false lumen patency correlates strongly with late aneurysm formation, such favorable remodeling is considered a surrogate for prevention of late aneurysm, but longer follow-up is required.",

    "abstract": "Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, together called venous thromboembolism, remain a serious national health problem. Estimates suggest that over 900,000 cases occur in the United States per year, with 300,000 deaths per year. Because of the significant and serious nature of this problem, a workshop was held in May of 2006, which resulted in the Acting U.S. Public Health Service Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism. On September 15, 2008, Acting Surgeon General, Rear Admiral Steven K. Galson, MD, MPH, and Elizabeth Nabel, MD, Director National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, announced the Call to Action. The Call to Action highlights public awareness about the risk factors, triggering events, and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and encourages the development of evidence based practices for screening, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It is designed to encourage new scientific investigation in an effort to obtain needed evidence to fill in the gaps of knowledge about venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This knowledge should be quickly and easily disseminated to the public and put into practice by health professionals. The Surgeon General's Call to Action represents one of the most important advances in the field of venous thromboembolism and sets the stage for multidisciplinary efforts to combat this serious national health problem.",

    "abstract": "Arterial diseases including atherosclerosis, intimal hyperplasia and aneurysms have been shown to be a product of genotype and environment. Gene expression pathways rely on protein translation to generate target effects. As a result of alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, one gene does not code for a single protein but for many. Proteomic studies allow quantification of these proteins in a biological system and determination of altered protein expression in disease. Proteomics is a powerful and expanding field of investigation which in combination with other 'omics may enhance understanding of disease pathophysiology and/or identify biomarkers of vascular disease. This review describes the methodology of protein mining and provides an insight into the valuable contributions already made by proteomics to vascular surgery.\nMEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant articles.\n118 relevant articles were identified. These were subdivided into categories based on the aspect of protein research they reported. The subheadings include methodology, atherosclerosis, intimal hyperplasia, aortic disease and biomarkers.\nDisease processes classified as genetic are functionally proteomic. Equally disease pathophysiology is the result of, or leads to alternate protein expression. Understanding the proteome will clarify the pathophysiology of disease. The translation of these findings to clinical practice impacts diagnosis, staging and treatment of disease processes. Biomarker discovery will enable earlier diagnosis of unstable atherosclerotic plaques, it will allow identification of aneurysms more likely to rupture and stratify risk. Proteomic research has enormous potential to modulate many aspects of patient care.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aneurysm is a life-threatening disease requiring immediate treatment. The outcome is even worse in cases complicated by aorto-caval fistula. Treatment is usually attempted by open surgery using direct closure of the venous tear and graft placement in the aorta. Interventional treatment in certain patients seems sensible and has been reported. We report a patient who experienced the rupture of a 13-cm infrarenal aneurysm into the inferior vena cava. He developed signs of severe heart failure and congestion of the lower half of the body. Diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT)-scan. Due to anatomy unsuitable for endovascular treatment and the potential bleeding complications associated with open surgery involving a big fistula, we decided to close the fistula with a covered stent in the vena cava and operated on the aortic rupture immediately thereafter. The ease of this hybrid approach justifies suggesting it as a possible treatment option for this severe disease.",

    "abstract": "Venous valves are still discussed controversially, mainly because it is still uncertain whether primarily missing or insufficient valves or the weakness of the venous walls cause varices. Furthermore, the distribution and frequencies of major superficial tributary veins (MSTVs), which should discharge the great saphenous vein (GSV) between the terminal (TV) and preterminal valve (PTV) gain in importance; a fortiori as remaining MSTVs during primary varicose vein treatment may be a reason of future recurrent varicose veins. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate both the frequency and position of the GSV valves and the distribution of MSTVs near the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ).\nWe investigated 114 formalin fixed bodies with 217 GSVs. The measurement of the position of the valves and the entrances of the MSTVs was performed in situ from the SFJ to the nodule of the valve or to the orifice of the tributary vein into the GSV, respectively.\nOn average, the specimens possessed 2.26 valves on the left side and 2.07 valves on the right side. First, valves were present in all 217 legs in a range of 0.0 to 7.2 cm. Taking as a basis the strict definition of a TV that it lies between the orifice of the GSV and the most proximal MSTV we could find only 75 TVs (68.8%) on the left side and 77 (71.3%) on the right side. In total, we found 803 MSTVs entering the GSV, an average of 3.7 veins per GSV. The left GSVs had significantly more MSTVs (P = .000). Most frequently, the superficial external pudendal vein (SEPV) existed in 90.3%, joining the GSV from medial 16.9 mm distally to the SFJ. A complete \"venous star\" of the MSTVs, as it is described in several textbooks, was present in only 18.4%.\nTerminal and preterminal valves of the GSV do not always exist. Using a strict definition whether a valve should be called either \"terminal valve\" or \"preterminal valve\", we will find a lot of them completely missing. This means that in a considerable number of patients reflux from the common femoral vein (CFV) to the GSV and further on into the MSTVs might occur. Several major superficial tributary veins join the GSV within the first millimeters; therefore a thorough exposition and monitoring of these vessels during diagnostic procedures are obviously crucial for a long-lasting success.",

    "abstract": "Previous animal models of venous disease, while inducing venous hypertension and valvular insufficiency, do not produce superficial varicose veins. In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize a pig-based model of superficial varicose veins.\nRight femoral arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) were surgically fashioned in young adult pigs. Animals were examined at postoperative times up to 15 weeks to determine the development of varicose veins and measurement of both blood pressure and flow velocities within the superficial thigh veins. Histology and vascular corrosion casts were used to characterize the resulting structural venous alterations. Porcine pathophysiological features were compared with those of human primary superficial varicose veins.\nGross superficial varicosities developed over the ipsilateral medial thigh region after an initial lag period of 1-2 weeks. Veins demonstrated retrograde filling with valvular incompetence, and a moderate, non-pulsatile, venous hypertension, which was altered by changes in posture and Valsalva. Venous blood flow velocities were elevated to 15-30 cm/s in varicose veins. Structurally, pig varicose veins were enlarged, tortuous, had valvular degeneration, and regions of focal medial atrophy with or without overlying intimal thickening.\nThe superficial varicose veins, which developed within this model, have a pathophysiology that is consistent with that observed in humans. The porcine femoral AVF model is proposed as a suitable experimental model to evaluate the pathobiology of superficial venous disease. It may also be suitable for the evaluation of treatment interventions including drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "The role of endovascular graft oversizing on risk of distal graft migration following endovascular aneurysm repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm is poorly understood. A controlled in vitro investigation of the role of oversizing in graft-aorta attachment strength for endovascular grafts (EVGs) with barbs was performed.\nBarbed stent grafts (N = 20) with controlled graft oversizing varying from 4-45% were fabricated while maintaining other design variables unchanged. A flow loop with physiological flow characteristics and a biosynthetic aortic aneurysm phantom (synthetic aneurysm model with a bovine aortic neck) were developed. The stent grafts were deployed into the aortic neck of the bio-synthetic aortic aneurysm phantom under realistic flow conditions. Computed tomography imaging of the graft-aorta complex was used to document attachment characteristics such as graft apposition, number of barbs penetrated, and penetration depth and angle. The strength of graft attachment to the aortic neck was assessed using mechanical pullout testing. Stent grafts were categorized into four groups based on oversizing: 4-10%; 11-20%; 21-30%; and greater than 30% oversizing.\nPullout force, a measure of post-deployment fixation strength was not different between 4-10% (6.23 +/- 1.90 N), 11-20% (6.25 +/- 1.84 N) and 20-30% (5.85 +/- 1.89 N) groups, but significantly lower for the group with greater than 30% oversizing (3.67 +/- 1.41 N). Increasing oversizing caused a proportional decrease in the number of barbs penetrating the aortic wall (correlation = -0.83). Of the 14 barbs available in the stent graft, 89% of the barbs (12.5 of 14 on average) penetrated the aortic wall in the 4-10% oversizing group while only 38% (5.25 of 14) did for the greater than 30% group (P < .001). Also, the stent grafts with greater than 30% oversizing showed significantly poorer apposition characteristics such as eccentric compression or folding of the graft perimeter. The number and depth of barb penetration were found to be positively correlated to pullout force.\nGreater than 30% graft oversizing affects both barb penetration and graft apposition adversely resulting in a low pullout force in this in vitro model. Barbed stent grafts with excessive oversizing are likely to result in poor fixation and increased risk of migration.",

    "abstract": "Constrictive external Nitinol meshes have been shown to suppress neointimal tissue formation and preserve endothelial integrity in vein grafts. As this mitigating effect increased with the degree of constriction, we investigated whether extreme constriction was possible without leading to detrimental luminal encroachment.\nA senescent non-human primate model (Chacma baboons/bilateral femoral interposition grafts) mimicking the clinical size-mismatch between vein grafts and run-off arteries was used. Control grafts were either untreated (group 1) or spray-coated with fibrin glue (group 2). Nitinol meshes constricting the lumen by <or=80% (group 3) were compared with longitudinally pleated meshes of identical circumference that constricted the lumen by >90% (group 4). Anastomotic size mismatch at implantation was expressed as quotient of cross-sectional area of run-off artery to vein graft (Q(C)).\nAt 6 months, all vein grafts without mesh support showed thick eccentric layers of neointimal tissue (group 1: 348 +/- 130 microm [Q(C) median at implant 0.19]; group 2: 318 +/- 142 microm [Q(C) median at implant 0.17]). Fibrin glue-spraying had no effect. In contrast, neointimal tissue was absent in all mesh-supported grafts (P < .007 in all cases) both at 6 weeks/6 months (group 3: 7.5 +/- 8.8 mum and 2.5 +/- 4.4 microm [Q(C) median at implant 1.47]; group 4: 1.3 +/- 0.6 microm and 3.8 +/- 5.6 microm [Q(C) median at implant 3.09]). Except for mild tissue buckling (fold height <356 microm) in one group 3 graft, none of the mesh-constricted grafts showed wall folds. Endothelial coverage was only complete in the mesh-supported groups (100% in group 3 and 4 vs 85 +/- 14%; P < .023 in group 1). Fibrin glue alone (52 +/- 48%) did not preserve endothelialization of control grafts (P < .38).\nExtreme vein graft constriction using external Nitinol meshes is possible without detrimental tissue buckling. Although moderate constriction was found to be sufficient for mitigating diffuse intimal hyperplasia and endothelial detachment, extreme constriction may occasionally be required to eliminate luminal irregularities.",

The difference in mean allele frequency between cases and controls was calculated for each SNP and used to identify candidate genomic regions. Association of candidate SNPs with AAA was confirmed by individual TaqMan genotype assays in a total of 2096 cases and controls that included an independent replication sample set.\nA genome wide association study of AAA cases and controls identified a candidate AAA-associated haplotype on chromosome 3p12.3. By individual genotype analysis, four SNPs in this region were significantly associated with AAA in cases and controls from the original study population. One SNP in this region (rs7635818) was genotyped in a total of 502 cases and 736 controls from the original study population (P = .017) and 448 cases and 410 controls from an independent replication sample (P = .013; combined P value = .0028; combined odds ratio [OR] = 1.33). An even stronger association with AAA was observed in a subset of smokers (391 cases, 241 controls, P = .00041, OR = 1.80), which represent the highest risk group for AAA. The AAA-associated haplotype is located approximately 200 kbp upstream of the CNTN3 gene transcription start site.\nThis study identifies a region on chromosome 3 that is significantly associated with AAA in 2 distinct study populations.",

    "abstract": "Although patient preference and outcome data support continued development and use of minimally invasive endovascular therapies, only a few studies have documented radiation exposure to the patient. This report summarizes patient radiation exposure by endovascular procedure at Cleveland Clinic.\nA retrospective review was undertaken of all endovascular procedures during a 30-month period. Procedures were categorized as infrarenal aortic aneurysm (IAA), isolated thoracic aneurysm (TA), visceral occlusive intervention, renal artery intervention, cerebrovascular intervention, cerebrovascular and lower extremity diagnostic, atherectomy, and lower extremity intervention. Radiation exposure was categorized by procedure. The estimated skin dose (ESD, mGy) and effective dose (ED, mSv) were calculated. Total computed tomography (CT) scans were tabulated for patients undergoing aneurysm stent grafting, and the cumulative ED was estimated. Statistical analyses were done with Kruskal-Wallis tests to detect overall differences, Wilcoxon rank sum exact tests for paired comparisons, and the Bonferroni post hoc test for group comparison.\nFluoroscopy times were recorded in 2103 endovascular procedures. The more complex the procedure, the longer the fluoroscopy time and ESD. Patients undergoing atherectomy had significantly higher ESD, at 1260 mGy (900, 1542; P < .001) than all groups. When converting to ED, however, cerebrovascular intervention and IAA received the highest ED, at 120 mSV (100, 150 mSV) and 109 mSV (85, 151 mSV; respectively, P < .001) among other groups. TAA patients underwent a greater number of CT scans than IAA patients (7.4 +/- 0.3 vs 5.8 +/- 0.2; P < .004). Tabulating the cumulative ED, including procedure and CT scans, showed IAA patients had significantly higher doses of radiation exposure than TAA patients (217 +/- 5 vs 191 +/- 6; P < .004).\nThe increasing complexity of endovascular interventions has resulted in increased radiation exposure to all involved, with the highest doses occurring in aneurysm repairs. Future innovations should concentrate on reducing the risk of radiation exposure to all personnel and developing newer imaging techniques.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for the management of iatrogenic and blunt traumatic intercostal artery (ICA) injuries associated with hemothorax and clinical deterioration.\nFrom May 1999 through April 2007, 24 consecutive patients (17 men, 7 women; mean age 53 years) presenting with active ICA hemorrhage underwent TAE mainly by means of coils combined with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles. Eleven of them had blunt traumatic injuries (group A, n = 11) and 13 had iatrogenic injuries (group B, n = 13). In all patients, ICA injuries resulted in acute bleeding with clinical deterioration and hemothorax. Before discharge, all patients underwent clinical examination, laboratory tests, and chest x-ray. After discharge, no specific follow-up protocol was required, and the patients were questioned on their state of health at regular intervals and underwent CT or chest x-ray as needed.\nPrimary technical success (PTS) was achieved in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%). In group A, it was achieved in all but one patient (90.9%) and in group B in 11 of 13 patients (84.6%). A total of three patients needed secondary interventions, which failed in one of them, amounting to a secondary technical success rate (STS) of 8.3%. The total cumulative mortality rate was 37.5% (n = 9). In group A, it was 9.1% (n = 1) and in group B, it was 61.5% (n = 8). 30-day-mortality was 9.1% in group A, where one patient died due to multiple severe associated injuries, and 30.8% (n = 4) in group B, where one patient died due to treatment failure and three patients due to severe comorbidities. During follow-up, no more deaths occurred in group A, while in group B, four more patients died due to severe comorbidities, amounting to a late mortality rate of 30.8%. No technical complications and no complications such as chest wall or spinal cord ischemia were observed. The mean observation period was 44.6 months in group A and 23.8 months in group B.\nTAE of ICAs is a minimally invasive, safe, and reliable treatment option to control massive intrathoracic hemorrhage, especially in patients with serious comorbidities and/or multiple injuries. However, it should be performed only by experienced interventionalists and exact knowledge of the anatomic features of the affected artery and of collateral pathways is mandatory to avoid complications.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative duplex ultrasound mapping of veins and arteries has been widely advocated to maximize the creation of native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for hemodialysis access, but reliable diameter criteria have not been established. We sought to determine patient and anatomic variables predictive of fistula maturation in patients receiving their initial permanent hemodialysis access.\nAll patients undergoing dialysis access creation from January 2003 to June 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. We analyzed fistula type and functional maturation rates (Society for Vascular Surgery [SVS] reporting standards) based on patient characteristics and findings on physical examination, preoperative vein mapping studies, or venography. Maturation and patency rates were determined by Kaplan Meier analysis. The following factors were analyzed: age, race, gender, body-mass index (BMI), fistula site, preoperative duplex vein diameter, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, HTN, prior central catheter placement, HIV, and history of IV drug abuse.\nFrom January 2003 to June 2007, 298 vascular access procedures were performed. One hundred ninety-five (65%) were initial hemodialysis access procedures, among which a native AVF was created in 185 (95%); 158 patients with posterior radiocephalic AVF (PRCAVF, n = 24), wrist radiocephalic AVF (WRCAVF, n = 72), or brachiocephalic AVF (BCAVF, n = 62) had adequate follow-up and were included in the analysis. PRCAVF, WRCAVF, and BCAVF had 54%, 66%, and 81% maturation rates, respectively. Both the type of fistula type (P = .032) and vein size (P = .002) significantly affected maturation by univariate analysis. In contrast, by multivariate logistic regression analysis, vein diameter was the sole independent predictor of fistula functional maturation (P = .002).\nIn this series of 158 patients undergoing initial hemodialysis access creation, native AVF creation was performed in 95%. In contrast to previous reports, age, gender, diabetes, and BMI had no significant effect on functional maturation. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, vein diameter was the sole independent predictor of functional fistula maturation.",

    "abstract": "Identifying which patients with varicose veins are at risk of progressing to more severe forms of chronic venous disease could help in assigning clinical priorities and targeting appropriate treatments. The aim of this study was to determine, in subjects with varicose veins, the characteristics of venous disease and other factors associated with an increased risk of ulceration.\nOne hundred twenty subjects with varicose veins and an open or healed venous leg ulcer were compared with 120 controls with varicose veins and no history of venous ulcer on this case control study. Subjects were recruited from hospital settings and primary care. Each subject completed a questionnaire on lifestyle and medical history and underwent an examination comprising of clinical classification of venous disease (CEAP), duplex scanning, quantitative digital photoplethysmography, and measurement of dorsiflexion. Multiple logistic regression analyses and calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to identify the combination of factors which most accurately predicted which patients with varicose veins will develop leg ulcers.\nAn increased risk of ulceration was associated with the severity of clinical venous disease, especially with the presence of skin changes (P < .0001). Other significant risk factors included history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (P = .001), higher body mass index (BMI) (P = .006), smoking (P = .009), and reflux in the deep veins (P = .0001). Ulceration was associated with reduced volume of blood displaced as reflected by photoplethysmography and a limited range of ankle movement (not wholly due to the effects of an active ulcer) (both P < .05). Multivariate analyses showed that skin changes including lipodermatosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 8.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-54.8), corona phlebectatica (OR 4.52, 95% CI 1.81-11.3) and eczema (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12-7.07), higher BMI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15), and popliteal vein reflux (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.03-7.75) remained independently associated with increased risk of ulceration while good dorsiflexion of the ankle (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.97) and an effective calf muscle pump (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99) remained protective factors. ROC curve analyses indicated that a model based on clinical observation of skin changes, duplex scanning for popliteal reflux, and calf muscle pump tests would be the most accurate in determining which patients with varicose veins develop leg ulcers.\nThe results of this study confirm that, in patients with varicose veins, those with skin changes of chronic venous insufficiency and deep vein incompetence are at greatly increased risk of ulceration. However, the risks may also be increased in those who smoke, are obese, and have restricted ankle movement and reduced calf muscle pump power.",

    "abstract": "Application of endovascular therapy has led to increasing rates of renal artery intervention with unclear effect on hypertension (HTN) and/or renal salvage (RS). We evaluated the role of procedure indication on outcomes of both open (OR) and percutaneous (PR) revascularization.\nRetrospective review of all consecutive renal artery interventions performed from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2006 was conducted. OR patients were included for analysis only if independent renovascular indications for revascularization existed.\nForty-seven OR and 203 PR (97% stent) patients were treated with 98% initial technical success. Patients with OR were younger (65 +/- 11 vs 72 +/- 9; P < .01), on more blood pressure (BP) medications (2.3 +/- 1.2 vs 1.8 +/- 1.2; P < .05), had more peripheral arterial disease (75% vs 37%; P < .01), and higher baseline creatinine (2.2 +/- 1.6 mg% vs 1.8 +/- 1 mg%; P < .05). Indications for PR were HTN in 46% and RS in 54%, and indications for OR were HTN in 51% and RS in 49% of cases. PR was unilateral in 169 (83%) and bilateral in 44/203 (17%). OR consisted of bypass in 26 (53%) and endarterectomy in 21/47 (47%) with 20 (43%) bilateral procedures. Peri-procedural complications were different (P < .01) and more frequent in OR (23% vs 12%). Survival was similar at three years (72% +/- 4% PR vs 71% +/- 9% OR; P = .9). Assisted patency was similar (P = .6) at one (94% +/- 2% PR vs 97% +/- 3% OR) and three years (90% +/- 3% PR vs 91% +/- 5% OR). One year (97% +/- 1% PR vs 97% +/- 3% OR) and three year (93% +/- 3% PR vs 91% +/- 7% OR) freedom from reintervention was similar (P = .8). Clinical outcomes showed patients with OR and PR having similar rates of cure or improvement in BP (76% PR vs 90% OR; P = .1) and favored OR with stable or improved renal function (97% vs 89%; P < .01) by the first postoperative visit. Hypertension control remained similar (P = .2) in both groups with cure/improvement in BP in 74% of PR and 89% of OR patients at one year. OR remained durable in regards to renal salvage with 52% of OR patients having improved renal function compared with 24% of PR (P < .01) patients at one year. At one year, BP control was achieved if treatment indication was HTN in 100% (18/18) of OR patients and 74% (46/63) (P = .04) of those having PR.

    "abstract": "Outcomes of open (OR) and endovascular revascularization (ER) for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) were analyzed with respect to clinical risk stratification.\nThe data of 229 consecutive patients treated for CMI with OR (146 patients/265 vessels) or ER (83 patients/105 vessels) between 1991 and 2005 were reviewed. Patients were classified as low-risk or high-risk using standard scoring systems. End points were mortality and morbidity, recurrence-free survival, and patency rates. A subset analysis compared 111 patients (208 vessels) who had OR with 58 patients (76 vessels) who had stenting.\nThe ER patients were significantly older (71 +/- 15 vs 65 +/- 11 years; P < .05), had higher risk (58% vs 31%), and fewer vessels revascularized (1.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.8 +/- 0.4). Four (2.7%) procedurally related deaths occurred in the OR and two (2.4%) in the ER group (P = NS). Mortality was higher for high-risk patients (OR, 6.7% vs 0.9%; ER, 4.8% vs 0%; P < .05), but differences were not significant among low-risk or high-risk OR vs ER patients. OR patients had more complications (36% vs 18%; P < .001) and longer hospitalization (12 +/- 8 vs 3 +/- 5 days; P < .001). At 5 years, OR had improved (P < .05) recurrence-free survival (89% +/- 4% vs 51% +/- 9%), and primary (88% +/- 3% vs 41% +/- 9%) and secondary patency rates (97% +/- 2% vs 88% +/- 4%). More restenoses (hazard ratio [HR], 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-10.2), recurrences (HR, 6.7; 95% CI, 3.3-13.8), and reinterventions occurred in the ER group (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9-9.7). At last follow-up, significant symptom improvement was noted in 137 OR (96%) and 72 ER patients (92%, P = NS). In the subset analysis of patients having first-time operations vs stenting, OR resulted in improved (P < .05) recurrence-free survival (91% +/- 3% vs 56% +/- 8% at 5 years) and better primary and secondary patency rates (93% +/- 2% and 98% +/- 1% vs 52% +/- 8% and 93% +/- 4% at 3 years).\nOR has similar mortality but higher morbidity and longer hospitalization than ER in low-risk or high-risk patients with CMI. Both treatments effectively improved symptoms, but restenosis, recurrent symptoms, and reinterventions were more likely in ER patients. These findings may guide treatment selection and counseling of low-risk and high-risk CMI patients undergoing OR or ER procedures.",

At multivariate analysis, CAD+PAD patients with transfemoral gradients of MPOx and IL-6 > median had a more compromised coronary artery endothelial function (P < .05, for both). Furthermore, CAD+PAD patients with transfemoral gradients of neutrophil MPOx content > median showed an independent association with a greater number of significant coronary stenoses, and a greater prevalence of three-vessel CAD and previous MI (P < .01, for all).

Outcomes were prepared using life-table methods and compared with log-rank analysis.\nDuring the last 10 years, 5443 lower extremity bypasses were performed on patients aged <90 years and 150 on patients aged >or=90 years. The <90 group had significantly more men (61.4% vs 29.3%) and was obviously younger, at 68 years (range 7-89 years) vs 92 years (range, 90-101 years). The <90 group had more comorbidities in terms of diabetes, active tobacco use, and hypercholesterolemia.

Outcomes were compared with published reports. Iliac artery duplex scans and aortoiliac angiography were performed to detect and confirm the internal iliac artery obstructive disease. The iliac duplex scanning surveillance protocol was set at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter to detect eventual restenosis or occlusion.\nBetween September 2006 and September 2008, 21 consecutive patients (19 men; mean age, 67 years) with 22 cases of buttock claudication (1 bilateral localization) underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone (14 cases) or additional stent placement in case of elastic recoil (8 cases). Buttock claudication was associated with impotence, thigh claudication, or calf claudication in seven patients. The endovascular approach was successful in all patients, without morbidity or mortality. During a mean follow-up of 14.7 +/- 5.7 months, 50% restenosis occurred in one 80-year-old patient. The patient had a pain-free walking distance of 110 meters and was treated conservatively.\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the largest published report concerning endoluminal treatment of buttock claudication due to internal iliac artery obstructive disease. The midterm results are very encouraging and underscore the value of stent-supported angioplasty as first-line treatment. The procedure can be repeated should significant restenosis occur and does not compromise the option of surgical repair of the lesions.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to assess the frequency and predictors of major amputation with patent endovascular-treated arterial segments (PETAS) in patients with critical limb ischemia.\nThe study included 358 consecutive patients (412 limbs) who underwent endovascular (236 limbs) or open (176 limbs) revascularizations for critical limb ischemia from June 2001 through May 2007. Patients with limb loss despite PETAS were compared with the rest of the endovascular-treated group (EV-other, n = 212) and with those who underwent amputations with patent bypasses (APB).\nThe EV group underwent 30 amputations (24 in PETAS, 6 in EV-other), and 37 occurred in the open group (14 in APB, 23 in open-other). Amputations occurring despite a patent revascularized segment constituted 38% of limb loss in open and 80% in EV-treated patients (P = .001). Limb loss occurred earlier in the PETAS group (58% vs 30% <or=3 months). Primary indications for limb loss in the PETAS group were extensive tissue loss or limb dysfunction after radical debridement of infection or gangrene (37%), recurrent infection (42%), and failure to reverse ischemia (21%). There were more patients with diabetes in PETAS group (96%) than in the APB group (64%, P = .018). Diabetes, dialysis-dependence, lower albumin level, gangrene, and infrapopliteal interventions were more likely in the PETAS group than in the EV-other group. Multivariate analysis showed diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-8.13, P = .018), gangrene (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.43-7.75; P = .005), and infrapopliteal interventions (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.38-6.94; P = .006), predicted limb loss with patent open or EV-treated segments, whereas dialysis-dependence, peroneal artery-only runoff, albumin level <3 g/dL, location at the heel, and treatment type did not.\nAmputation despite PETAS is the most common means of limb loss in patients undergoing endovascular revascularization for limb salvage. It is likely the result of aggressive attempts at limb salvage and usually occurs <or=3 months after the intervention. Patients with diabetes and gangrene undergoing infrapopliteal interventions are at a significantly high risk. Adjuncts to reduce tissue loss, preserve limb function, and prevent recurrent infection are needed to prevent limb loss despite PETAS, especially in diabetic patients.",

Amputations occurring despite a patent revascularized segment constituted 38% of limb loss in open and 80% in EV-treated patients (P = .001). Limb loss occurred earlier in the PETAS group (58% vs 30% <or=3 months). Primary indications for limb loss in the PETAS group were extensive tissue loss or limb dysfunction after radical debridement of infection or gangrene (37%), recurrent infection (42%), and failure to reverse ischemia (21%). There were more patients with diabetes in PETAS group (96%) than in the APB group (64%, P = .018). Diabetes, dialysis-dependence, lower albumin level, gangrene, and infrapopliteal interventions were more likely in the PETAS group than in the EV-other group. Multivariate analysis showed diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-8.13, P = .018), gangrene (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.43-7.75; P = .005), and infrapopliteal interventions (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.38-6.94; P = .006), predicted limb loss with patent open or EV-treated segments, whereas dialysis-dependence, peroneal artery-only runoff, albumin level <3 g/dL, location at the heel, and treatment type did not.",

    "abstract": "Surgeons must weigh the morbidity of lower extremity bypass (LEB) with the likelihood of a functional outcome postoperatively. We developed a model to predict ambulation status 1 year after LEB.\nWe analyzed a prospective registry of 1561 LEB procedures performed for occlusive disease (2003-2005) in 1400 patients (50 surgeons, 11 hospitals). Ambulation status was assessed preoperatively, at discharge, and at 1-year by life-table analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine predictors of ambulation status 1 year postoperatively.\nThe indication for surgery was claudication in 25% and critical limb ischemia (CLI) in 75%. Claudicant patients had higher primary (79% vs 73%, P < .001) and secondary (87% vs 81%, P < .001) graft patency rates and were more likely to be alive and ambulatory 1 year postoperatively (96% vs 81%, P < .001) than CLI patients. Amputation rates were 12% for CLI patients and 1% for claudicant patients (P < .001). All claudicant patients walked before surgery, and the 95% who survived 1 year postoperatively remained ambulatory. Preoperatively, 93% of CLI patients were ambulatory, and 88% of the survivors at 1 year remained ambulatory. The risk of dying or being nonambulatory 1 year postoperatively was increased in patients who were nonambulatory preoperatively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.6; P < .0001), by increasing age of 70-79 (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6; P < .007) and 80-89 years (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.7; P < .0001), by CLI (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4; P < .007), by postoperative myocardial infarction (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6-4.1; P < .001), and by major amputation (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.1-4.1; P < .001). Graft thrombosis during follow-up (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; P < .003) and living in a nursing home preoperatively (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-7.8; P < .003) were independently associated with a higher risk of being nonambulatory at 1 year.\nAmbulatory and independent living status are well preserved after LEB. Risk factors of age, preoperative ambulatory ability, independent living status, CLI, graft patency, and amputation help to predict ambulatory status 1 year postoperatively. The likelihood of death or nonambulatory status at 1 year was <5% in patients with none of these risk factors to nearly 50% in patients with three or more risk factors. These variables can be used to inform decision making about whether patients should undergo LEB.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity bypass graft failure in patients with limb-threatening ischemia carries an amputation rate of greater than 50%. Redo bypass is often difficult due to the lack of conduit, adequate target, or increased surgical risk, and resultant limb salvage rates are reduced significantly compared with the index operation. We set forth to investigate whether endovascular treatment in this setting would result in an acceptable limb salvage rate.\nA single-institution, retrospective review from June 2004 to December 2007 of patients with failed grafts who underwent endovascular treatment with percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA) of their native circulation was performed. Stents were selectively used in cases of post-PTA residual stenosis or flow-limiting dissection. Technical success was defined as a residual stenosis less than 30%. Percutaneous attempts at bypass graft salvage were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, procedural data, and follow-up information were recorded. Descriptive, logistic regression and life-table analyses were performed.\nTwenty-four lower extremities were treated in 23 patients with failed bypass grafts. Average patency of the index graft before failure was 647 days (range 5-2758). Mean age was 68 years (range 51-85), 62% were male and 81% had diabetes mellitus (DM). 87.5% of limbs treated had TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) C and D lesions and 62% had multiple lesions. Technical success was achieved in 100%. Mean follow-up was 25.6 months. At follow-up, there were 17 PTA failures, which resulted in: amputation (4), redo-bypass (3), and redo-PTA (11). Freedom from surgical revision and PTA failure was 89% (+/- 0.07 SE) and 28% (+/- 0.09 SE) respectively. PTA secondary patency was 72% (+/- 0.09 SE) and limb-salvage was 81% (+/- 0.08 SE) at both 12 and 24 months. Overall survival was 83% (+/- 0.07 SE) and 77% (+/- 0.09 SE) at 12 and 24 months, respectively.\nEndovascular treatment of patients with previously failed bypass grafts results in a high rate of limb salvage. This is a reasonable option in selected patients and the primary choice in those with poor targets, conduit, or excess surgical risk. Endovascular salvage should be considered before proceeding to primary amputation.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests disparities exist among racial groups with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Hispanics (HI) are the fastest growing demographic in the United States, but little outcome data is available for this population. Therefore, we undertook this study to compare the results of autogenous infrainguinal bypass grafting in HI to Caucasians (CA) and African Americans (AA).\nThis was a comparative cohort study of prospectively collected registry data of infrainguinal bypass performed at a tertiary center. Patient demographics and comorbidities, operative indications, bypass graft characteristics, and postoperative courses were analyzed. Cumulative patency rates, limb salvage, mortality, and factors associated with these outcomes were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.\nFrom January 1, 1985, through December 31, 2007, 1646 consecutive patients (1408 CA, 57 HI, and 181 AA) underwent 1646 autogenous infrainguinal reconstructions. HI and AA were younger and more often diabetic than CA but HI had less chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and dialysis-dependence than AA. AA, but not HI, more commonly underwent bypass for critical limb ischemia (CLI) in comparison to CA (AA 90% vs CA 80%, P < .0001; HI 86%). HI and AA bypass grafts had inflow and outflow distal to that in CA. Perioperative mortality (2.3%) and morbidity were similar between groups. Five-year primary patency (+/- standard error [SE]) was significantly lower in HI compared to CA and similar to that in AA (HI 54% +/- 7% vs CA 69% +/- 1%, P = .02; AA 58% +/- 4%). Cox proportional hazard modeling showed high-risk conduit, age <65, CLI, female gender, and AA race were risk factors for failure of primary patency. Secondary patency of HI grafts, unlike AA, was not different than that in CA. Five-year limb salvage (+/- SE) was significantly lower in HI compared to CA and similar to that in AA (HI 80% +/- 6% vs CA 91% +/- 1%, P = .004; AA 83% +/- 3%). Hispanic ethnicity, CLI, high-risk conduit, age <65, CRI, female gender, and diabetes were significant predictors of limb loss.\nAutogenous infrainguinal bypass surgery in HI is associated with primary patency and limb salvage inferior to that of CA and similar to that of AA, despite HI rates of CLI equivalent to CA and HI comorbidities less severe than AA. HI ethnicity was an independent predictor of limb loss. Our data provides evidence of outcome disparities in HI treated aggressively for their PAD.

    "abstract": "The original abdominal Excluder (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) endoprosthesis has been associated with late aneurysm sac expansion over time from transgraft ultrafiltration of serous fluid. This has been treated by relining the graft with original or low-permeability components. We asked whether additional component overlap of the original graft material resulting from proximal or distal extensions placed at the time of initial repair would influence the rate of late aneurysm sac expansion in the absence of endoleak.\nComputed tomography (CT) scans from subjects (n = 120) receiving the original endoprosthesis from the Excluder pivotal trial were measured for total distance of original graft overlap (including contralateral gate, proximal extension, or distal extension overlap) based on reformatted CT scans. This was compared to change in aneurysm sac diameter and volume (as measured in independent laboratories) at the latest time point available. Patients were omitted if they were missing CT scan data (n = 10), their graft was explanted for endoleak (n = 2), they underwent an intervention for endoleak and did not have diameters available after their intervention (n = 3), or if they had a continued endoleak that could account for an increase in aneurysm sac diameter (n = 11). This left 27 patients with more overlapping components than the required contralateral limb/gate overlap (mean follow-up time 40.6 +/- 17.0 months) and 67 patients with required gate overlap (mean follow-up time 46.2 +/- 15.9 months).\nSubjects with increased component overlap (mean overlap 87.1 mm +/- 57.4 mm) were not protected from aneurysm sac expansion when compared to those with the minimum required gate overlap (mean overlap 31.2 mm +/- 3.4 mm). There was no association of total distance of overlap with aneurysm sac size change by diameter or volume (r(2) = 0.00034, P = .86 for diameter and r(2) = 0.0019, P = .68 for volume). Increasing percentage of overlap within the aneurysm sac was likewise not associated with aneurysm sac decrease in diameter (r(2) = 0.0028, P = .61). Few patients had large percentages of original graft overlap (mean 26.2% +/- 14.1% for the increased overlap group and 18.6% +/- 5.5% for the required overlap group, P = .0097).\nPartial graft overlap involving multiple original components from proximal and distal extensions is not protective against aneurysm sac expansion due to transgraft ultrafiltration. This suggests that transgraft ultrafiltration is not impeded by having partial double layers of original material. All patients who received the original Excluder and have late aneurysm sac expansion in the absence of endoleak should have as complete relining as feasible with low permeability components if sac shrinkage is the surrogate goal.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is an alternative to open repair (OR) in patients with blunt trauma. We report our initial experience after integration of endovascular repair using thoracic devices.\nA retrospective review of a prospectively collected institutional trauma registry was performed. Between September 2005 and November 2008, 71 patients with TAI presented to our institution. Based on imaging, TAIs were classified into grade 1-4 in severity. These included: grade 1, intimal tear; grade 2, intramural hematoma; grade 3, aortic pseudoaneurysm; and grade 4, free rupture. Initial management included resuscitation, blood pressure control, and treatment of associated injuries. After stabilization, all patients were considered for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) using a thoracic device. If contraindicated, candidates underwent OR. Outcome measures were mortality, stroke, paraplegia, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital stay.\nThe mean age was 39.8 years, with 50 males. The mean injury severity score (ISS) was 42.6. Nineteen (27%) patients with a mean ISS of 60 died shortly after arrival prior to any vascular intervention. Ten (14%) patients with grade 1 injuries were managed medically. The remaining 42 (59%) patients with grade 2 and 3 injuries underwent repair. Median interval between admission and repair was 4.3 days (range, 0-109 days).

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated imaging offers insight into aortic shape changes throughout the cardiac cycle. Morphologic changes of the anchoring zones may influence stent graft fixation and sealing and may have serious implications for endograft design and durability. We used multiphase magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the asymmetric aspect of aortic shape changes in the aneurysm neck before and after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nEleven patients were scanned before and after EVAR using ECG-gated balanced gradient-echo MRI with 16 reconstructed phases. Transverse scan planes were planned perpendicular to the aorta in the coronal and sagittal planes. Three levels were studied: 3 cm above the lowest renal artery, between the renal arteries, and 1 cm below the lowest renal artery. After segmentation of the aortic area in the images, aortic radius changes during the cardiac cycle were determined over 360 axes and plotted. Radii were measured from the center of mass of the aortic lumen to the vessel wall. An ellipse was fitted over the plots allowing determination of radius changes over the major and minor axis, and the most prominent direction of distention.\nThe difference between radius change over the major and minor axis was significant preoperatively and postoperatively (P </= .002) at all levels, indicating asymmetric expansion. The pre-EVAR mean radius change over the major vs minor axis was infrarenal, 0.9 +/- 0.2 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm; juxtarenal, 1.0 +/- 0.2 vs 0.8 +/- 0.1 mm; and suprarenal, 1.3 +/- 0.4 vs 0.9 +/- 0.2 mm. At all levels, there was no significant difference (P > .05) between pre-EVAR and post-EVAR radius changes. Pre-EVAR, the ratio of the radius change over the major vs minor axis ranged from 1.10 to 1.82. The pre-EVAR and post-EVAR asymmetry ratios did not differ significantly (P > .1). Preoperatively, the suprarenal direction of distention showed a tendency to right-anterior; for infrarenal, the tendency was to left-anterior.\nWe measured the asymmetric aspect of earlier reported pulsatile aortic shape changes. The rate of asymmetric distention varied by patient and level. Asymmetric aortic expansion may have consequences for endograft design because it probably affects endograft sealing, especially in patients with high radius changes and asymmetry ratios. Asymmetric expansion remained preserved after stent graft placement. The stent grafts with Z-stent rings used in the study participants seem to adapt to the aortic shape changes well.",

    "abstract": "Para-anastomotic aortic aneurysms and progressive aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta after previous open aortic reconstruction pose a challenging clinical scenario. Due to the proximity to the visceral arteries, endovascular exclusion is typically not an option. However, the development of fenestrated and branched endografts has provided a less invasive means of repair. We sought to evaluate our experience using fenestrated endografts in the management of juxtarenal aortic aneurysms after previous open aortic reconstruction.\nThis is an analysis of patients who have undergone fenestrated endovascular repair specifically for juxtarenal aneurysms in the setting of previous infrarenal open aortic surgery. Patients were treated with customized Cook (William A. Cook Australia, Ltd, Brisbane, Australia) endografts manufactured based on preoperative 3-dimensional (3-D) imaging. All patients underwent repair under the direction of a single surgeon.\nEighteen patients were treated from March 2004 to November 2008. All patients had a previous open aortic reconstruction, and 3 patients had two prior reconstructions. The mean time since the last operation was 8.5 years (range, 1-15 years). Mean patient age was 72-years-old (range, 57-80 years). All patients were considered high risk for open surgery due to pre-existing medical co-morbidities and/or the redo nature of their surgery. The mean number of fenestrations per patient was three vessels, including proximal graft scallops. All but one operation (94%) was completed by totally endovascular means. One operation required a planned celiotomy for retrograde access to a left renal artery. Of 56 target vessels, all were successfully revascularized using a combination of: fenestrations with stents (12), or stent grafts (25), as well as graft scallops (18), and directional graft branches with a bridging stent graft (1). Mean operative time was 215 minutes (range, 135-420 minutes) and mean blood loss was 560 cc (range, 100-1500 cc). Thirty-day and 1-year mortality was 0 and 11%, respectively. Perioperative complications occurred in 2 patients. One patient developed a congestive heart failure exacerbation and myocardial infarction, and the other patient a groin wound infection. Mean follow-up time was 23 months and cumulative primary patency was 95% (53/56 vessels), with no follow-up interventions.\nEndovascular treatment of juxtarenal aneurysms after prior aortic reconstruction is a viable alternative to open repair with high success and low reintervention rates. These devices will broaden the available treatment modalities for these conditions, and will likely significantly decrease the complication rate of treatment in these high-risk patients.",

Unlike CEA, CAS is performed by a wide variety of specialists including vascular surgeons (VS), interventional cardiologists (IC), and interventional radiologists (IR). This study compares the indications, in-patient mortality rate, and in-patient stroke rate for patients undergoing CAS, according to operator specialty.\nThe State In-patient Databases from New York and Florida, made available by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, were reviewed by International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9-CM codes to identify all patients treated with CAS for the years 2005 and 2006. This cohort was then stratified according to operator specialty defined by procedures performed by each operator over the years surveyed. Primary endpoints were in-patient death and stroke. Propensity score matching adjusting for indication, demographics, and comorbidities was employed to evaluate the influence of operator type on outcomes.\nDuring the study period, 4001 CAS procedures were performed. All primary analyses compared VS (n = 1350) to non-VS (n = 2651). Patient characteristics were similar, except VS treated fewer patients with CAD (44.2% vs 50.9%, P < .001) and valvular disease (6.3% vs 8.6%, P = .01) and more patients with chronic lung disease (19.4% vs 15.9%, P = .01). Each group performed an equal proportion of CAS for symptomatic disease (8.1% vs 9.0%, P = .32). Univariate analysis revealed no difference in mortality (0.9% vs 0.5%, P = .13) or stroke (1.3% vs 1.5%, P = .73). Propensity score matched analysis also demonstrated no difference in mortality (0.7% vs 0.4%, P = .48) or stroke (1.1% vs 1.7%, P = .27). Subgroup analysis comparing VS, IC, and IR showed no significant difference in mortality or stroke, but demonstrated that of the three specialties, IC treated the smallest proportion of symptomatic patients. The proportion of CAS performed by VS differed significantly by state (New York 46%, Florida 19%, P < .01).\nDespite a paucity of level 1 evidence for CAS in asymptomatic patients and current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) policy limiting reimbursement for CAS to only high-risk symptomatic patients, VS and non-VS are treating primarily asymptomatic patients. Perioperative rates of stroke and death are equivalent between VS, IC, and IR. Regional variation of operator type is substantial, and despite similar outcomes, <50% of CAS is performed by VS.",

    "abstract": "The routine use of intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring with selective shunt placement during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to be safe and effective. We attempt to identify the anatomic and clinical factors associated with significant EEG changes requiring shunt placement during CEA.\nBetween January 2005 and June 2007, 242 CEAs were performed with selective shunt placement for significant EEG changes. Risk factors assessed include severity of both ipsilateral and contralateral disease, presence of ipsilateral preoperative symptoms, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, age, gender, and preemptive intraoperative blood pressure manipulation to >or=20% above baseline before cross-clamping. Data were analyzed with the chi(2) test (P < .05 was significant).\nCEA was performed for asymptomatic disease in 177 of 242 patients (73.1%). The perioperative stroke rate was 0.8% (2 of 242), and the overall morbidity rate was 4.5%. No patients died. Significant EEG changes requiring shunt occurred in 35 patients (14.46%). Factors associated with carotid shunt placement were moderate ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis (50% to 79%) compared with severe (>or=80%) disease (30.6% vs 11.7%, P = .003) and degree of contralateral carotid stenosis (0% to 49%, 10.8%; 50% to 79%, 10.9%; 80% to 99%, 23.2%; occlusion, 50%; P = .0003). Presence of symptoms, gender, age, hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease, and preemptive intraoperative manipulation of blood pressure were not significant predictors of shunt placement.\nCEA performed with routine EEG monitoring and selective shunt placement is associated with a low risk of perioperative stroke. Identified predictors of significant EEG changes were anatomic factors including degree of contralateral carotid artery disease and moderate ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis (50% to 79%). Although contralateral carotid occlusion has been accepted as indication for shunt placement in the absence of cerebral monitoring, this study suggests that high-grade contralateral disease and moderate ipsilateral carotid stenosis are associated with cerebral ischemia resulting in EEG changes and should prompt consideration for nonselective shunting.",

    "conclusions": "CEA performed with routine EEG monitoring and selective shunt placement is associated with a low risk of perioperative stroke. Identified predictors of significant EEG changes were anatomic factors including degree of contralateral carotid artery disease and moderate ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis (50% to 79%). Although contralateral carotid occlusion has been accepted as indication for shunt placement in the absence of cerebral monitoring, this study suggests that high-grade contralateral disease and moderate ipsilateral carotid stenosis are associated with cerebral ischemia resulting in EEG changes and should prompt consideration for nonselective shunting.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to review the contemporary presentation and evolution of management of neck paragangliomas.\nForty-one neck paragangliomas operated on in 36 patients over a 44 year period were included in the current report. The study period was divided into two parts, the first three decades (1964-1989), during which the current management techniques were evolved, and the last two decades (1990-2008).\nPatients presented with a palpable neck mass (n = 17), cranial nerve (CN) palsy (n = 3) or both (n = 6), or the lesion was an incidental finding (n = 14). The use of cross-section imaging modalities (n = 24) increased from 35% during the first part of the study to 95% during the second part of the study (P < .001). Preoperative embolization (introduced in 1979) was performed in 60% (median size 4.3 cm for embolized vs 3 cm [P = .02], for non-embolized tumors). During the first study period, the frequency of Shamblin group II/III tumors was 95% compared with a frequency of 42% during the second study period (P < .001, odds ratio 25), median blood loss was 600 ml and 150 ml, respectively (P = .001) and the transfusion rate was 44% and 5%, respectively (P = .008). The incidence of temporary and permanent new CN deficits postoperatively was 22.5% and 10%, respectively, and was similar during the two study periods. Three tumors were malignant, based on lymph node involvement (n = 1) or development of late metastases (n = 2).\nIn the modern era, neck paragangliomas can be managed with a low incidence of long-term sequelae. Smaller, asymptomatic, and incidentally detected tumors are currently the most common presentation pattern.",

    "abstract": "U.S. black and Hispanic populations are growing at a steady pace. In contrast, the medical profession lacks the same minority growth and representation. Women are also under-represented in many surgical disciplines. The purpose of this study was to assess trends in the proportion of women, blacks, and Hispanics admitted to vascular surgery (VS) and related specialties, and to compare them with each other and with a surgical specialty, orthopedic surgery (OS), with a formal diversity initiative.\nData on the fellowship pool of VS, interventional radiology (IR), and interventional cardiology (IC), as well as the resident pools of general surgery (GS) and orthopedic surgery (OS), were obtained from U.S. graduate medical education reports for 1999 through 2005. Cochrane-Armitage trend tests were used to assess trends in the proportion of females, blacks, and Hispanics in relation to the total physician workforce for each subspecialty.\nNo significant trends in the proportion of females, blacks, or Hispanics accepted into VS and IC fellowship programs occurred during the study period. In contrast, IR, GS, and OS programs revealed significant trends for increasing proportions of at least one of the underrepresented study groups. In particular, OS, which has implemented a diversity awareness program, showed a positive trend in female and Hispanic trainees (P < .04 and P < .02, respectively). Blacks showed a significant increasing trend only in IR (P = .05). Conversely, a positive trend toward continued growth in the Hispanic group was seen in GS (P < .001), IR, and OS (P = .04 and P = .02, respectively).\nThe racial/ethnic and gender composition of the physician trainee pool in vascular specialties, particularly VS, has not matched the increasing growth of underrepresented groups in the US population of patients with vascular disease. Formal programs to recruit qualified women and minorities appear successful in increasing workforce diversity.",

    "abstract": "A straight thoracic stent graft often complies poorly with the curvature of the aortic arch. We have previously reported an in vitro model of a modified stent graft that can be bent in situ after deployment to improve conformance to the aortic arch. We now report the first clinical experience with this technique in three consecutive patients.\nBetween September 2007 and August 2008, three patients were treated for different pathologies of the aortic arch with a modified thoracic stent graft that was fitted with a sliding self-locking knot and a detachable Bowden cable. Transfemoral traction on the Bowden cable enables controlled shortening of the proximal part of the stent graft at the inner curve after deployment. The stent graft is thereby directed to allow for better apposition to the aortic wall.\nThe modified thoracic stent grafts were correctly orientated and deployed in all patients. Transfemoral traction on the Bowden cable successfully bent all stent grafts and improved vessel wall apposition without a residual gap on the inner curve. The Bowden cable was successfully released and withdrawn in all patients.\nIn situ bending of thoracic stent grafts with a sliding self-locking knot is feasible and improves proximal apposition of the device at the inner curve of the aortic arch. More data and longer follow-up are required to confirm the applicability of this technique.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest an increased risk of neurologic complications after coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). The preventative role of preoperative revascularization of the LSA using carotid-subclavian bypass or transposition remains controversial. We assessed this increased risk and the role of revascularization by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.\nIn the absence of any randomized controlled trials, the Pubmed and Embase databases were searched to identify all series reporting TEVAR without LSA coverage compared with LSA coverage with and without revascularization. The incidence of neurologic complications, namely cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and spinal cord ischemia (SCI), were recorded for each group. Pooled odds ratios (POR) were then calculated for postoperative CVA and SCI.\nCompared with patients without LSA coverage, the risk of CVA was increased both in patients with LSA coverage alone (4.7% vs 2.7%; POR, 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.09; P = .005) and in those with LSA coverage after revascularization (4.1% vs 2.6%; POR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.17-8.65; P = .02). The risk of SCI was also increased in patients requiring LSA coverage (2.8% vs 2.3%; POR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.30-4.39; P = .005) but not for LSA coverage after revascularization (0.8% vs 2.7%; POR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.56-5.15; P = .35).\nThe risk of neurologic complications is increased after coverage of the LSA during TEVAR. Preemptive revascularization offers no protection against CVA, perhaps indicating a heterogeneous etiology. Revascularization may reduce the risk of SCI, although limited data tempers this conclusion. Improved or perhaps compulsory reporting to registries of a minimum data set may help further assess the exact etiology of these complications and identify a higher-risk subset of patients in whom revascularization might prove protective.",

The feasibility and long-term durability of this form of intervention are largely unknown.\nThe records of five patients who received endografts to treat aortobronchial fistulas at our institution were reviewed. A literature review was also conducted using MEDLINE to identify reports detailing outcomes of patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair for this condition. Primary outcome end points included intraoperative mortality, 30-day mortality, and aortobronchial fistula recurrence.\nFor the five patients treated at our institution, technical success was 100%. In follow-up, aortobronchial fistulas recurred in two patients, resulting in one patient death and one endograft explantation. We identified 32 reports that met inclusion for our final review. Inclusive of the five patients treated at out institution, 67 patients with reported outcomes comprised the overall analysis. Most patients (55%) had previously undergone thoracic aortic surgery. Commercially manufactured thoracic endografts were used in 75% of patients. No intraoperative mortality was reported, and the 30-day mortality was 1.5%. Aortobronchial fistula recurred after endovascular repair in six patients (9%) through a mean follow-up of 21.5 months. Three cases of recurrent aortobronchial fistula resulted in patient death.\nThoracic endovascular aortic repair of aortobronchial fistulas appears to a viable alternative to conventional open repair with excellent short-term results. Recurrence of the aortobronchial fistula after endovascular repair is a potential complication necessitating long-term surveillance. Individual risk assessment is needed to determine if endovascular repair should be used as bridge therapy or as a definitive repair.",

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome patients are prone to aortic dilatation, dissection, and rupture. Success of aortic root replacement has generated a cohort of patients surviving longer and presenting with distal aortic dissection and enlargement. Thoracic endovascular stent-graft repair (TEVR) is being increasingly utilized to exclude aneurysms resulting from chronic aortic dissection. This report explores the role of TEVR in Marfan patients with this pathology.\nReview of a prospectively maintained database identified seven patients with Marfan syndrome offered endovascular repair of aneurysmal chronic aortic dissection. All patients had previous aortic root repair. Talent or Valiant (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) aortic stent-grafts were used to occlude the dissection entry tear and cover the thoracic aorta. Electronic data, case notes, and radiological surveillance were analyzed.\nSeven consecutive patients (six male; mean age, 45.9 +/- 10 years, range, 29 to 63) underwent successful thoracic stent-graft deployment. Mean aortic aneurysmal diameter was 63.4mm (+/-11.2) with six of seven dissections extending to the aortic bifurcation. No perioperative neurological events occurred. Thirty-day mortality was 1/7 (14%) due to congestive cardiac failure. At median 16 month follow-up, two of six cases (33%) required intervention for endoleak. Aortic false lumen thrombosis (FLT) occurred in 5/6 (83%) cases and partial FLT occurred in 1/6 (17%). All thoracic aortas continued to dilate during follow-up. Crude median aortic growth rate was 7.2 mm/year (range, 3.5 to 19 mm).\nTEVR in Marfan syndrome patients with chronic aortic dissection is technically feasible. However, post intervention surveillance confirms that the aorta continues to dilate despite graft deployment and false lumen thrombosis. Endovascular repair may offer a viable option in patients who have contraindications to open surgery, but longer follow up of more patients is required to define the place of this therapy.",

    "abstract": "Venodynamics and lymphodynamics may interact as an inseparable and mutually dependent dual outflow system. This study investigated the effect of surgical treatment on lower limb lymph flow in patients with varicose veins.\nThirty-nine patients with varicose veins in the lower limb (28 patients with unilateral limb, 11 patients with bilateral limb), who demonstrated great saphenous vein reflux, were investigated with air-plethysmography and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence lymphography before surgical treatment and 6 months later. Fifteen healthy volunteers participated in this study as a control. With air-plethysmography, venous volume (VV) and venous filling time were measured. Venous filling index (VFI) was calculated. For ICG lymphography, 0.3 mL of ICG (0.5%) was subcutaneously injected at the dorsum of the foot. After the injection, fluorescent image of ICG dye was traced on real-time video images using a near-infrared camera system. The interval until the dye reached the knee was measured (transit time [TT]) in a standing position, which was previously demonstrated to correlate with the interval measured using dynamic isotope lymphoscintigraphy.\nIn CEAP clinical stage venous disease, TT in patients with C4 approximately 6 and C2 approximately 3 was significantly longer than that in the control group (587 +/- 97 seconds, 484 +/- 82 seconds, 252 +/- 29 seconds, respectively, mean +/- SD, P < .01). Among all limbs with varicose veins, there were correlations between TT and VV (Pearson r = 0.31, P < .01), between TT and VFI (Pearson r = 0.48, P < .01). All patients underwent great saphenous vein stripping. Six months later, the venous clinical severity score significantly improved with significant reductions in both VV and VFI values. TT 6 months postoperatively was also significantly shorter than that before surgical treatment (501 +/- 67 seconds, 340 +/- 38 seconds, respectively, mean +/- SD, P < .01).\nVaricose veins could affect lymphatic function and delay lymphatic flow in the lower limbs. Derangement of lymph flow may correlate with the severity of clinical venous disease and/or the magnitude of venous reflux, which could be reversible with surgical treatment of venous incompetence.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies have demonstrated higher in-hospital mortality in women undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The current study evaluates the relationship between gender and 30-day outcomes for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in a multicenter, contemporary patient population.\nPatients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) participant use file that underwent EVAR of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from 2005 to 2007 were identified by CPT codes. Outcomes analyzed were 30-day mortality, morbidity (one or more of 21 complications defined by the ACS NSQIP protocol), length of hospital stay, and six complication subgroups. Preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and outcomes were compared across genders using chi(2) (binary and categorical variables) and t tests (continuous variables). The relationship of gender to outcomes was further evaluated using multivariate logistic regressions to adjust for pre- and intraoperative risk variables.\nIn 3662 EVAR patients, 647 (17.7%) were women and 3015 (82.3%) men with mean ages of 75.1 +/- 9.0 and 73.7 +/- 8.5 years (P < .001). Tube graft (360, 9.8%); bifurcated, one docking limb (1624, 44.3%); bifurcated, two docking limbs (1294, 35.3%); unibody (218, 5.9%); and aorto-uni-iliac/femoral (166, 4.4%) repairs were performed. Tube and aorto-uni-iliac/femoral grafts were more common in women (21.4% vs 12.8%, P < .001) than men, as were femoral/femoral crossovers (3.9% vs 1.8%, P = .011) and iliac or brachial exposures (2.8% vs 1.0%, P = .009). Overall morbidity and mortality were 11.9% and 2.1%, respectively. Mortality in women was significantly higher (3.4% vs 2.1%, P = .014), as was morbidity (17.8% vs 10.6%, P < .001). Of thirteen independent preoperative risk factors for mortality or morbidity, women had a higher incidence in five: emergent operation, functional dependence, recent weight loss, underweight status or morbid obesity, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After adjustment for these variables, the odds ratio (OR) for mortality in women vs men was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-2.69, P = .157); OR for morbidity was 1.65 (95% CI 1.28-2.14, P < .001). Female gender was also found to be an independent risk factor for length of stay (Beta 0.7 days, 95% CI 0.2-1.2, P = .006), infectious complications (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.03, P = .011), wound complications (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.12-2.90, P = .015) and postoperative transfusion (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.39-6.13, P = .002).\nMortality and morbidity were higher in women than men undergoing EVAR. Multivariate analysis showed that the increased risk of mortality was related to women presenting more emergently, more debilitated (recent weight loss and functional dependence), and requiring iliac or brachial exposure. After adjustment for multiple preoperative and operative factors, women remained at significantly higher risk for the development of a broad range of complications and increased length of stay.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to validate high-frequency ultrasound (HFU) measurement of dermal thickness for quantification of edema in patients with different severities of chronic venous disease.\nHFU measurements of dermal thickness were made with a 17-MHz probe (Philips iU22 Ultrasound scanner, Bothell, Wash) or a 20-MHz medium-focus probe (DermaScan-C, Cortex Technology, Denmark), 7.5 cm above the medial malleolus. For validation, 20 patients with venous leg ulcers who were not receiving compression therapy, 20 patients with previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) without ulceration, and 31 age-matched healthy controls were measured on a single occasion. To investigate the effect of compression on dermal thickness, the leg ulcer patients from the validation study were treated with compression therapy for 7 weeks and measured after 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks. The association between dermal thickness and the clinical (C) component of the CEAP classification was examined in a cross-sectional analysis of 157 patients with a confirmed history of DVT >or=3 years ago.\nDermal thickness in patients with venous leg ulcers before compression therapy (median, 2.56 mm; interquartile range [IQR], 2.31-2.82 mm) was significantly greater (P = .002) than that in patients with symptoms of PTS without ulceration (median, 2.16 mm; IQR, 1.90-2.36 mm). Dermal thickness in both groups was significantly greater (P < .0001) than the control group (median, 1.34 mm; IQR, 1.29-1.44 mm). Compression therapy caused a steady and significant decrease in dermal thickness during the first 5 weeks until normal control levels were achieved. Dermal thickness increased with increasing CEAP category. In 121 patients with a positive diagnosis of DVT >or=3 years ago from Radiology Department records, a hypothetical test cutoff of 1.985 mm for the prediction of severe PTS noted as C(4b), C(5), and C(6) (lipodermatosclerosis or leg ulceration) had a positive predictive value of 46.9% and a negative predictive value of 90.3%.\nHFU measurement of dermal thickness enables the monitoring of edema reduction by compression therapy. A prospective study is required to determine the temporal dynamics of dermal thickness changes after DVT and the relationship to the development of PTS. This test has the potential to be beneficial in the follow-up of patients after a DVT and provide clinical evidence for using graduated elastic compression stockings to control edema and prevent the development of more advanced skin changes.",

    "abstract": "The PREVENT III (PIII) critical limb ischemia (CLI) risk score is a simple, published tool derived from the PIII randomized clinical trial that can be used for estimating amputation-free survival (AFS) in CLI patients considered for infrainguinal bypass (IB). The current study sought to validate this risk stratification model using data from the prospectively collected Vascular Study Group of Northern New England (VSGNNE).\nWe calculated the PIII CLI risk score for 1166 patients undergoing IB with autogenous vein by 59 surgeons at 11 hospitals between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007. Points (pts) were assigned to each patient for the presence of dialysis (4 pts), tissue loss (3 pts), age >or=75 (2 pts), and coronary artery disease (CAD) (1 pt). Baseline hematocrit was not included due to a large proportion of missing values. Total scores were used to stratify each patient into low-risk (<or=3 pts), med-risk (4-7 pts), and high-risk (>or=8 pts) categories. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate AFS for the three risk groups. Log-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons. To assess validation, comparison to the PIII derivation and validation sets was performed.\nStratification of the VSGNNE patients by risk category yielded three significantly different estimates for 1-year AFS (86.4%, 74.0%, and 56.1%, for low-, med-, and high-risk groups). Intergroup comparison demonstrated precise discrimination (P < .0001). For a given risk category (low, med, or high), the 1-year AFS estimates in the VSGNNE dataset were consistent with those observed in the previously published PIII derivation set (85.9%, 73.0%, and 44.6%, respectively), PIII validation set (87.7%, 63.7%, and 45.0%, respectively), and retrospective multicenter validation set (86.3%, 70.1%, and 47.8%, respectively).\nThe PIII CLI risk score has now been both internally and externally validated by testing it against the outcomes of 3286 CLI patients who underwent autogenous vein bypass at 94 institutions by a diverse array of physicians (three independent cohorts of patients). This tool provides a simple and reliable method to risk stratify CLI patients being considered for IB. At initial consultation, calculation of the PIII CLI risk score can reliably stratify patients according to their risk of death or major amputation at 1 year.",

    "abstract": "The effects of a new long-term subcutaneous vascular access device were studied in access-challenged patients who were poor candidates for fistulas or grafts due to venous obstruction. Bacteremia rates, patency, and function of the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) Vascular Access Device (Hemosphere Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) were evaluated.\nThe HeRO device consists of a 6-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft attached to a 5-mm nitinol-reinforced silicone outflow component designed to bypass venous stenoses and enter the internal jugular vein directly, providing continuous arterial blood flow into the right atrium. The HeRO device was studied in a multicenter clinical trial to test the hypothesis that access-challenged patients would experience a statistically significant reduction in bacteremia rates compared with a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) literature control of 2.3/1000 days. HeRO-related bacteremia rates, adequacy of dialysis, patency, and adverse events were analyzed.\nThe HeRO device was implanted in 36 access-challenged patients who were followed for a mean 8.6 months (9931 HeRO days). The HeRO-related bacteremia rate was 0.70/1000 days. All HeRO-related bacteremias occurred during the bridging period when a TDC was still implanted before HeRO graft incorporation. HeRO adequacy of dialysis (mean Kt/V) was 1.7. HeRO primary patency was 38.9%, and secondary patency was 72.2%.\nIn access-challenged patients, a statistically significant reduction in HeRO-related bacteremia was noted compared with TDC literature. The device had similar function and patency compared with conventional arteriovenous graft literature.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the femoral artery is associated with symptoms ranging from claudication to tissue loss. This study examined the clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of isolated femoral endarterectomy (FEA) as well as the predictors of symptom recurrence and need for further intervention.\nPatients who underwent an isolated FEA between January 2001 and June 2008 were reviewed. Concurrent superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease was classified into Trans Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) II categories based upon angiographic findings. Hemodynamic success (HS) was defined as a postoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) increase of >or=0.15. Clinical improvement was classified by Rutherford criteria. Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of clinical failure and need for additional intervention (AI). Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to determine the likelihood of both over time.\nNinety-five patients (105 limbs) with a mean age of 68.3 +/- 10.2 years were reviewed. Indications were severe claudication in 68 (64.8%) limbs and critical limb ischemia (CLI) in 37 (35.2%). Mean preprocedural ABI was 0.57 +/- 0.25. The SFA-popliteal segment was classified as: normal in 34% of limbs, TASC A 23%, B 19%, C 9%, and D in 15%. One fatal myocardial infarction accounted for a procedural mortality of 0.95%. Morbidity was 6.7% (four hematomas and three wound infections) and mean hospital stay was 2.5 +/- 3.1 days. Patency was 100% with a mean follow-up of 11 months (1-72). Complete resolution of symptoms was noted in 73.4% with some clinical improvement noted in 91% of limbs. HS was achieved in 85.1% with a mean ABI increase of 0.27 +/- 0.20, and this correlated with >or=2 runoff vessels (odds ratio [OR] 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.96; P = .045). Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed that 83.8% of patients with marked initial clinical improvement remained symptom free at 2 years, whereas only 28.6% in the group with mild and moderate initial response maintained their clinical status. Freedom from AI at 2 years was 61.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that TASC C and D lesions (OR 9.3 [2.43-35.63] P = .001) and diabetes (OR 3.64 [1.01-13.15] P = .048) were predictive of recurrent symptoms while extensive endarterectomy and >or=2 vessel tibial runoff decreased the need for AI.\nFEA can achieve excellent immediate clinical and hemodynamic outcome in patients with claudication and CLI; however, patients with diabetes and femoropopliteal TASC C and D lesions are likely to experience recurrent symptoms. Long-term symptomatic improvement is associated with the degree of immediate clinical success as well as the status of the run-off vessels. Limited FEA and poor tibial runoff are associated with the need for AI.",

    "abstract": "Carotid arterial stent (CAS) systems are an alterative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of moderate to severe carotid stenosis, but the effectiveness of CAS compared to endarterectomy in preventing stroke and death is uncertain. This study's objective was to compare the clinical outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing carotid revascularization before and after CAS became widely available.\nThis observational, retrospective cohort study compared 46,784 patients undergoing carotid revascularization from August 2005-March 2006 (the coverage era) to propensity-score-matched patients undergoing carotid revascularization between October 2002-September 2004 (the pre-coverage era), before widespread Medicare coverage of CAS.\nMortality was compared at 90 and 270 days after revascularization, as were the combined outcomes of periprocedural acute myocardial infarction and any stroke or death within 90 and 270 days after revascularization, between the two eras. Comparisons were also made between localities with high (23% of carotid procedures being CAS) and lower (9% of carotid procedures being CAS) adoption rates of carotid stents during the coverage era.\nThere were no significant differences in 90-day mortality (2.2% vs 2.2%; P = .79), 90-day combined outcomes (4.5% vs 4.3%; P = .13), or 270-day mortality (4.8% vs 4.6%; P = .17) between the coverage and pre-coverage eras, but there were more 270-day combined outcomes in the coverage era (7.7% vs 7.3%; P = .03). In localities with higher adoption of carotid stents, there was higher 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.15; P = .16), 90-day combined outcomes (OR = 1.17; P = .03), 270-day mortality (OR = 1.13; P = .07), and 270-day combined outcomes (OR = 1.10; P = .09) in the coverage era. There were no differences in event rates between eras in areas with lower carotid stent adoption.\nThe adoption of carotid stents for treatment of carotid stenosis was associated with increased rates of adverse clinical outcomes after carotid revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) share common risk factors with atherosclerosis, except for diabetes which appears protective. The reason for this is unknown. Although increased circulating concentrations of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) such as carboxymethyllysine (CML) are associated with occlusive vascular disease, it is possible that their effects on the aortic wall explain the paradoxically low incidence of AAAs in diabetes.\nWe studied 234 community-dwelling men aged 65 to 79 years. The cases comprised all identifiable diabetic men with AAA (aortic diameter > or =30 mm on ultrasound; n = 27) and randomly-selected non-diabetic men with AAA (n = 67). Controls were age-matched randomly-selected diabetic men (n = 69) and age-matched randomly-selected non-diabetic men (n = 71) without AAA (aortic diameter 18 to 22 mm). Serum CML concentrations were measured by validated indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nSerum CML concentrations were significantly lower in men with AAAs than those without (6627 +/- 1544 vs 7309 +/- 1490 nmol/mol lysine; P = .001). Variables positively associated with AAA were height, diastolic blood pressure, smoking, a history of coronary heart disease, and serum creatinine (P < or = .040), while serum CML (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] per 1000 nmol/mol lysine; 0.80 [0.64-0.98]) and a history of diabetes were inversely associated (P < or = .040). After adjusting, the interaction between diabetes status and serum CML was negatively associated with AAA (P = .016).\nThese cross-sectional data show that circulating concentrations of CML are reduced in diabetic men with AAAs. This is in contrast to studies of the relationship between AGEs and occlusive manifestations of cardiovascular disease and could explain the inverse association between diabetes and AAA.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have evaluated the natural history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but few have correlated the clinical progression using duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging during the first year. This study was designed to determine the relationship of changes in the venous system and correlate them with long-term progression of disease.\nConsecutive patients with a first episode of proximal DVT documented by DU imaging were included prospectively. Clinic examinations were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. The CEAP system was used to grade disease severity. DU imaging was performed at least once, 1 year after the diagnosis, and repeated at 5 years. The proximal veins were divided the common femoral vein, femoral vein, and popliteal vein segments for analysis. Thrombosed veins were subsequently graded as completely, partially, and fully recanalized. Recurrent DVT cases were also recorded.\nThe study included 64 patients with 73 involved limbs; of which, skin damage was documented in three (4%) at 1 year and in 18 (25%) at 5 years (P = 0.0006; relative risk [RR], 3.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-11.3). Overall from 1 to 5 years, 50 limbs remained the same. A change in clinical class occurred in 23 limbs (31.5%), including five limbs that progressed from class 0 to 3, 15 limbs from class 3 to 4 and 6, and three from class 4 to 5 and 6. DU imaging of these 23 limbs progression showed that the most important predictor for class progression was ipsilateral recurrent DVT (RR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.4-13.3). Recurrent DVT at 1 year occurred in 21.9%, including ipsilateral in 15.6% and contralateral in 6.3%. Total recurrence at 5 years was 31.3%, including ipsilateral in 23.4% and contralateral in 7.8%. Limbs with ipsilateral recurrence were more likely to have partial recanalization, reflux, and more vein segments involved compared with those with contralateral recurrence or no recurrence (11 of 15 vs 16 of 58; RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.7-13.3).\nClinical class progression from year 1 to 5 occurs in 30% of post-thrombotic limbs. The most important predictor for progression in clinical class was ipsilateral recurrent DVT.",

The observation period ranged from 12 to 78 weeks. Patient and ulcer characteristics were evenly distributed in three studies, favored the stocking groups in four, and the bandage group in one. Data on the pressure exerted by stockings and bandages were reported in seven and two studies, amounting to 31-56 and 27-49 mm Hg, respectively. The proportion of ulcers healed was greater with stockings than with bandages (62.7% vs 46.6%; P < .00001). The average time to healing (seven studies, 535 patients) was 3 weeks shorter with stockings (P = .0002). In no study performed bandages better than MCS. Pain was assessed in three studies (219 patients) revealing an important advantage of stockings (P < .0001). Other subjective parameters and issues of nursing revealed an advantage of MCS as well.\nLeg compression with stockings is clearly better than compression with bandages, has a positive impact on pain, and is easier to use.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study investigated persistent reflux of the below knee great saphenous knee (GSV) 2 years after stripping the above knee GSV and the effect on reflux of postoperative incompetent perforating veins (IPVs).\nIncluded were 59 consecutive ambulatory patients in a community hospital with untreated primary varicose veins and reflux of the saphenofemoral junction and at least the GSV in the upper leg. Patients underwent a preoperative clinical examination and color flow duplex ultrasound imaging. Postoperative evaluations were at 6 months and 2 years, and 67 limbs were re-evaluable. This analysis was adjusted for age, CEAP, follow-up period, and preoperative reflux using a multivariate logistic regression model. The difference in diameter of the GSV below the knee before and after surgery was measured and tested with the paired t test.\nClearly visible varicose veins in the GSV below the knee were seen in 49 limbs (73%) before surgery and after surgery in 11 limbs (16%) at 6 months and in 15 limbs (22%) at 2 years. Reflux in the below knee main stem increased from 81% before surgery to 84% at 6 months and 91% at 2 years after surgery. Reflux in the posterior calf tributary of the GSV decreased from 67% before surgery to 64% at 6 months and 59% at 2 years after surgery. The mean diameter of the below knee GSV main stem decreased from 4.7 mm before surgery to 3.3 mm 6 months after surgery (P < .001), but increased to 3.6 mm 2 years after surgery (P < .05). The mean diameter of the posterior calf tributary of the GSV decreased from 3.5 mm before surgery to 2.7 mm at 6 months (P < .001), but increased to 2.9 mm at 2 years (P < .05). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression shows no association between reflux in one of the GSV below knee branches and postoperative IPVs.\nMany patients (91%) that undergo a short stripping procedure will have a persistent reflux of the remnant below knee GSV tributaries postoperatively. This incompetence of the distal GSV is independent from the proximal GSV as well from insufficient perforating veins. There seems to be a tendency to worsening of the clinical signs and symptoms between 6 months and 2 years after surgery, and this goes along with an increase of reflux and diameters of the GSV below knee remnants.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate current evidence in the literature on the efficacy of Semmes Weinstein monofilament examination (SWME) in diagnosing diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).\nThe PubMed database was searched through August 2008 for articles pertaining to DPN and SWME with no language or publication date restrictions. Studies with original data comparing the diagnostic value of SWME with that of one or more other modalities for DPN in patients with diabetes mellitus were analyzed. Data were extracted by two independent investigators. Diagnostic values were calculated after classifying data by reference test, SWME methodology, and diagnostic threshold.\nOf the 764 studies identified, 30 articles were selected, involving 8365 patients. There was great variation in both the reference test and the methodology of SWME. However, current literature suggests that nerve conduction study (NCS) is the gold standard for diagnosing DPN. Four studies were identified which directly compared SWME with NCS and encompassed 1065 patients with, and 52 patients without diabetes mellitus. SWME had a sensitivity ranging from 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44% to 68%) to 93% (95% CI, 77% to 99%), specificity ranging from 75% (95% CI, 64% to 84%) to 100% (95% CI, 63% to 100%), positive predictive value (PPV) ranging from 84% (95% CI, 74% to 90%) to 100% (95% CI, 87% to 100%), and negative predictive value (NPV) ranging from 36% (95% CI, 29% to 43%) to 94% (95% CI, 91% to 96%).\nThere is great variation in the current literature regarding the diagnostic value of SWME as a result of different methodologies. To maximize the diagnostic value of SWME, a three site test involving the plantar aspects of the great toe, the third metatarsal, and the fifth metatarsals should be used. Screening is vital in identifying DPN early, enabling earlier intervention and management to reduce the risk of ulceration and lower extremity amputation.",

    "abstract": "There are very few population-based studies of long-term outcomes after lower extremity (LE) bypass graft surgery. This study analyzes perioperative and long-term limb salvage and amputation-free survival outcomes for patients undergoing initial aortoiliac or femoropopliteal bypass graft surgery in California hospitals from 1996 to 1999.\nAdministrative data with encrypted identifiers were used to identify a chronologically first, index admission of all patients undergoing LE bypass procedures for occlusive disease from 1996 to 1999. A 1993 to 1995 look-back period was used to exclude patients who had undergone prior bypass surgery or amputation procedures. Patients with incident procedures were then followed forward to determine subsequent hospitalizations and vital status through 2004. The study comprised 28,128 patients discharged from 345 California hospitals with a median 61.5-month follow-up. Risk factors included demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, admission type, gangrene or ulceration, operation level, hospital LE bypass surgery volume, and year of discharge. Logistic regression was used to analyze 30-day outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze amputation-free survival.\nOverall 30-day mortality was 4.3, and the 30-day major amputation rate was 2.6%. Limb salvage was 81.9% at 5 years and 76.4% at 9 years. Amputation-free survival was 51.5% at 5 years and 34.1% at 9 years. Risk factors were generally similar for both perioperative and late outcomes. Advanced age, higher comorbidity level, gangrene, and emergency or nursing home admission conferred significantly greater risk. Hospital volume was associated with both perioperative and late outcomes. African American and Hispanic patients had much higher amputation rates but did not have higher mortality risk after controlling for baseline severity of illness.\nLong-term outcomes of LE bypass surgery were superior for high-volume hospital patients. Graft surveillance and risk factor follow-up care provide a major opportunity for quality improvement efforts. The contrast between traditional limb salvage and amputation-free survival outcomes raises questions about the value of surgical treatment, particularly for patients with limited life expectancy and without coding of tissue loss or critical limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (aRVD) is an increasingly recognized cause of severe hypertension and declining kidney function. Patients with aRVD have been demonstrated to have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events compared with patients without aRVD. For these reasons, >45,000 renal artery revascularization procedures are performed annually, with significant growth observed in the number of procedures performed each year. The efficacy of contemporary revascularization therapies in the treatment of aRVD is unproven and controversial, with no level I data to support current practices. Lower-level data suggest that kidney function improvement is a key indicator of subsequent improved survival free of adverse cardiovascular events and dialysis, and that observed improvements of hypertension confer, at best, limited benefit. This review focuses on existing data on the management of aRVD, including data from completed and ongoing randomized clinical trials. This review also examines other existing data regarding aRVD that may guide current treatment and future research efforts into this significant clinical and public health problem until widely accepted level I evidence emerges.",

    "abstract": "Recruitment and entrapment of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is important in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. EPC mobilization and differentiation are modulated by stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha/CXCL12), another important chemokine. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that SDF-1alpha and VEGF might act synergistically on EPC-mediated vasculogenesis.\nEPCs were isolated and cultured from human peripheral blood, then transduced with retroviral vectors pBabe containing human VEGF(165) complimentary DNA (Td/V-EPCs) and pBabe wild-type (Td/p-EPCs). EPC migration activity was investigated with a modified Boyden chamber assay. EPC apoptosis induced by serum starvation was studied by annexin V assays. The combined effect of local administration of SDF-1alpha and Td/V-EPC transplantation on neovascularization was investigated in a murine model of hind limb ischemia.\nOver-expression of hVEGF(165) increased SDF-1alpha-mediated EPC migration. SDF-1alpha-mediated migration was significantly increased when EPCs were modified with VEGF (Td/V-EPCs) vs when VEGF was not present (Td/p-EPCs) or when VEGF alone was present (Td/V-EPCs; 196.8 +/- 15.2, 81.2 +/- 9.8, and 67.4 +/- 7.4/mm(2), respectively P < .001). SDF-1alpha combined with VEGF reduced serum starvation-induced apoptosis of EPCs more than SDF-1alpha or VEGF alone (P < .001). To determine the effect of this combination in vivo, SDF-1alpha was locally injected alone into the ischemic hind limb muscle of nude mice or combined with systemically injected Td/V-EPCs. The SDF-1alpha plus VEGF group showed significantly increased local accumulation of EPCs, blood-flow recovery, and capillary density compared with the other groups. The ratio of ischemic/normal blood flow in Td/V-EPCs plus SDF-1alpha group was significantly higher (P < .01), as was capillary density (capillaries/mm(2)), an index of neovascularization (Td/V-EPCs plus SDF-1alpha group, 863 +/- 31; no treatment, 395 +/-13; SDF-1alpha, 520 +/- 29; Td/p-EPCs, 448 +/- 28; Td/p-EPCs plus SDF-1alpha, 620 +/- 29; Td/V-EPCs, 570 +/- 30; P < .01). To investigate a possible mechanistic basis, we showed that VEGF up-regulated the receptor for SDF-1alpha, CXCR4, on EPCs in vitro.\nThe combination of SDF-1alpha and VEGF greatly increases EPC-mediated angiogenesis. The use VEGF and SDF-1alpha together, rather than alone, will be a novel and efficient angiogenesis strategy to provide therapeutic neovascularization.",

    "abstract": "Successful outcome after lower extremity revascularization is usually measured by physician-oriented terms such as graft patency and amputation-free survival. It has been increasingly appreciated that these criteria do not necessarily translate into success from the prospective of the patient. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to retrospectively examine success after lower extremity revascularization for tissue loss using patient-oriented measures and to include patients who underwent both open surgical bypass and endovascular therapy.\nBetween 1998 and 2005, 677 patients (316 endovascular and 361 open surgery) underwent revascularization for ischemic tissue loss. The method of revascularization (endovascular or open surgery) was left to the discretion of the surgeon. Revascularization was considered to be clinically successful if each of the following occurred: reconstruction patency until wound healing, limb salvage for 1 year, maintenance of ambulation for 1 year, and survival for 6 months. The influence of 20 intrinsic patient factors, including type of revascularization (open vs endo) was examined using the chi(2) test. Significant factors in bivariate analysis were included in a logistic regression model to determine independent predictors and probability of failure.\nOverall clinical success was achieved in 277 (40.9%) patients. Success for open surgical and endovascular cohorts was 44.3% and 37.0%, respectively (P = .06). Type of intervention was not a significant factor in either bivariate or logistic regression analysis. Independent predictors of failure (odds ratio [OR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) regardless of treatment type included impaired ambulatory status at the time of presentation (OR 3.24; CI 2.14, 4.90), diabetes (OR 1.62; CI 1.14, 2.32), endstage renal disease (ESRD) (OR 1.55; CI 1.07, 2.23), presence of gangrene (OR 2.0; CI 1.42, 2.82), and prior vascular intervention (OR 1.46; CI 1.02, 2.10). Paradoxically, hyperlipidemia (OR 0.70; CI 0.50, 0.98) was a predictor for success. Probability of failure was 35.4% (OR 1.0) if no independent predictors were present and increased with the addition of each adverse predictor. For instance, diabetic patients with impaired ambulatory status and gangrene had an 85.2% (OR 10.5) probability of failure. In the worst case scenario, a diabetic patient with ESRD, impaired ambulatory status, gangrene, and a prior vascular intervention was considered, probability of failure was a dismal 92.8% (OR 23.7).\nClinical success after lower extremity revascularization for ischemic tissue loss is determined by intrinsic patient factors and not by method of revascularization. These data reiterate that future investigation efforts should be focused less on the method of revascularization and more on identification of patient cohorts at risk for failure regardless of treatment.",

Independent predictors of failure (odds ratio [OR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) regardless of treatment type included impaired ambulatory status at the time of presentation (OR 3.24; CI 2.14, 4.90), diabetes (OR 1.62; CI 1.14, 2.32), endstage renal disease (ESRD) (OR 1.55; CI 1.07, 2.23), presence of gangrene (OR 2.0; CI 1.42, 2.82), and prior vascular intervention (OR 1.46; CI 1.02, 2.10). Paradoxically, hyperlipidemia (OR 0.70; CI 0.50, 0.98) was a predictor for success. Probability of failure was 35.4% (OR 1.0) if no independent predictors were present and increased with the addition of each adverse predictor. For instance, diabetic patients with impaired ambulatory status and gangrene had an 85.2% (OR 10.5) probability of failure. In the worst case scenario, a diabetic patient with ESRD, impaired ambulatory status, gangrene, and a prior vascular intervention was considered, probability of failure was a dismal 92.8% (OR 23.7).",

    "abstract": "Endotension is one of the possible specific late complications of endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We describe the treatment of endotension in a small group of 3 patients (all men, aged 58, 70, and 70-years-old) by translumbar puncture of the aneurysm sac and aspiration of its content. It was transudate and its culture was negative. Sac size reduced after aspiration in all patients and no subsequent enlargement was seen. Percutaneous translumbar puncture of the aneurysm sac with aspiration of sac content could be an easy and effective method of treatment in endotension. But a larger group of patients and long-term follow-up are needed.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the perioperative (30-day) and long-term outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in elderly patients with severe symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease. Although the efficacy of CEA in preventing stroke in selected patients has been clearly demonstrated, concern has been expressed about the role of CEA in people over 80 years old.\nAn analysis was conducted on a prospectively compiled computerized database of all primary CEAs performed at our institution from 1990 to 2007. Descriptive demographic data, risk factors, surgical details, perioperative strokes and deaths, and other complications were recorded. All patients underwent postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning and clinical follow-up at one, six, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier life-tables. Long-term relative survival after CEA was assessed against age- and gender-matched controls.\nIn all, 1769 CEAs were performed in 1562 patients, 193 of them (207 CEAs; group I) were > or = 80 years old and 1371 were younger (1562 CEAs; group II). All CEA procedures were performed with patients under deep general anesthesia with continuous perioperative EEG monitoring for selective shunting. No strokes or deaths occurred in group I, whereas there were 11 perioperative strokes and three deaths in group II (1%). A complete follow-up (median, 5.2 years) was obtained in 185 elderly patients: no late occlusions or restenoses were detected, while the seven-year freedom from stroke and death were 96.6% and 52.4%, respectively. The relative seven-year survival rate was 99.8%.\nCEA in elderly patients proved safe and effective, with an excellent long-term durability. The long-term relative survival after CEA in elderly patients was better than in an age-and gender-matched population, so the likelihood of living long enough to benefit from CEA is not jeopardized by being very elderly.",

Two groups were created. Group 1 had 72 restenoses at a mean of 71 months (range, 5-245 months) after initial CEA. Group 2 had 740 primary stenoses. Clinical end points were cerebral ischemic events and death. TCD end points were numbers of isolated microemboli and microembolic showers during five procedural phases.\nGroups 1 and 2 were evenly matched for demographic data: median age, 70 vs 71 years; 44 (61%) vs 525 men (71%); 14 (19%) vs 147 symptomatic (20%).

    "abstract": "To evaluate potential predictive factors associated with success or failure of incompetent perforating veins (IPVs) treated with radio-frequency stylet (RFS).\nOver the last 12 months in this observational study, 38 consecutive patients with various degrees of venous insufficiency and IPVs underwent 48 office-based radio-frequency ablation procedures (1 - C 3; 7 - C 4; 10 - C 5; 30 - C 6) in 44 limbs. There were 21 females and 17 males with a mean age of 67 +/- 17 years (38-93 years) who had a total of 93 IPVs (40 calf; 53 ankle). Eighteen patients (47%) had ipsilateral great saphenous vein (GSV) radio-frequency closures performed prior to current procedure. The venous flow pattern was classified by spectral waveform analysis as \"normal\" (spontaneous with respiratory phasicity) in 33 patients and \"pulsatile\" (with bidirectional cardiac phasicity) in five patients. Follow-up duplex scans were performed from 3 to 7 days postprocedure. Statistical analyses were performed for determining correlation between the various factors such as, age, pulsatile flow, CEAP class, prior GSV ablation, vein diameter, reflux, and patency.\nThe mean number of ablated IPVs was 1.94 +/- 0.38 ranging from 1-3. Immediate success rate was 88% (82 cases, 32 patients). IPVs had a duplex measured mean diameter of 3.8 +/- 1.1 mm (2-6.6 mm). Eleven IPVs remained patent in six patients. There was no significant difference between the patent and the obliterated IPV groups concerning age (P = 0.75), prior GSV ablation (P = .19), IPV diameter (P = .08) and CEAP classification. Conversely, four of the five procedures (80%) performed in patients with \"pulsatile\" venous flow failed, while only two of the remaining 43 procedures (4.7%) in patients with \"normal\" venous flow failed (P < .001).\nThese data show that a pulsatile venous flow pattern is a significant predictor of failure following RFS for IPVs.",

    "abstract": "The use of endovenous procedures to treat superficial venous reflux disease in an exclusively outpatient setting has been growing in popularity during the last decade. Incorporating outpatient venous procedures into an existing vascular surgery practice is a logical step and provides optimal patient care by using the combined expertise and knowledge of devoted vascular surgeons and dedicated supporting staff. This affords the opportunity to treat patients comprehensively and to streamline the evaluation and treatment process for patients with virtually all stages of chronic venous insufficiency. Successful establishment of an outpatient vein care clinic involves making well-informed decisions about workspace, staffing, acquisition of equipment, optimization of reimbursement, and patient recruitment. Separation of the venous practice from the arterial practice both geographically and temporally is critical to success because the clinical and operational needs of these two groups of patients are very different and because the vein practice in many situations may become so robust that it erodes physicians' participation in the arterial side of the vascular practice. In addition to favorable clinical results and increased patient demand, procedures performed on an outpatient basis can be expected to significantly increase revenues. With proper strategy and organization, an outpatient vein practice can round out the existing vascular practice and be a profitable adjunct to an already established vascular surgery practice.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aneurysms (EVAR) is currently used in patients with large aneurysm. Two randomized studies, Dutch Randomised Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM) and Comparison of Endovascular Aneurysm Repair with Open Repair in Patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (EVAR-1), showed favorable early results with EVAR; but at 2 and 4 years, the rates of all-cause mortalities were no longer different. Patients in EVAR groups required more reinterventions. These data were confirmed by national audits and large registries. However, there is still uncertainty concerning the durability of the devices, and long-term results are unknown. The ACE (Anevrysme de l'aorte abdominale, Chirurgie versus Endoprothese) trial is a multicenter, prospective randomized trial aimed at assessing the results of EVAR and of open surgery in relatively good-risk patients presenting with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic or aortoiliac aneurysm. The primary end point is death and major complications up to 5 years after randomization. Analysis of results is underway, and publication due by the end of the year.",

    "abstract": "Patch angioplasty is commonly performed after carotid endarterectomy. Randomized prospective trials and meta-analyses have documented improved rates of perioperative and long-term stroke prevention as well as reduced rates of restenosis for patches compared with primary closure of the arteriotomy. Although use of vein patches is considered to be the gold standard for patch closure, newer generations of synthetic and biologic materials rival outcomes associated with vein patches. Future bioengineered patches are likely to optimize patch performance, both by achieving minimal stroke risk and long-term rates of restenosis as well as by minimizing the risk of unusual complications of prosthetic patches such as infection and pseudoaneurysm formation. In addition, lessons from bioengineered patches will likely enable construction of bioengineered and tissue-engineered bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "A 42-year-old male with Marfan syndrome, who had undergone aortic root and total arch replacement for type-A acute aortic dissection at the age of 40, underwent descending aorta replacement with woven Dacron (Vascutek Ltd., Renfrewshire, Scotland) because of pseudoaneurysm at the site of the distal anastomosis and an enlarged pseudolumen of the dissecting descending aorta. The fourth and eighth ribs were cut at their anterior and posterior sites to allow wide exposure of the entire descending aorta. Postoperative computed tomographic scanning showed that the vascular prosthesis posteriorly contacted the eighth rib stump. On the postoperative day 25, the patient collapsed and developed severe hypotension. Emergency thoracotomy revealed a 6 mm in diameter hole on the posterior side of the vascular prosthesis. One day later, the patient died of cardiac dysfunction resulting from sustained hypotension. Electron microscopic examination of the vascular prosthesis showed that the hole was caused by frayed fabric and disrupted polyester fibers. Our experience warns that a woven polyester vascular prosthesis could rupture within 3 weeks of contacting a rib stump.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms remains unclear. There is epidemiologic and histologic evidence showing significant differences in aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Studies suggest that abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) may represent a local manifestation of a systemic dilating diathesis. It is not known whether thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) also have a systemic etiology. The evidence for a systemic dilating diathesis in AAA disease is reviewed and supplemented with an original morphologic study based on computed tomography (CT) comparing nonaneurysmal controls with patients with AAAs and TAAs.\nCT scans performed between January and November 2008 of 150 consecutive patients were examined. The morphology and dimensions of branches of the aorta in 50 TAA patients and 50 AAA patients were compared with 50 nonaneurysmal controls. Measurements of the aorta, common carotid artery (CCA), and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were taken along with corresponding patient risk factors.\nPatients were well matched for age, gender, and comorbidity. Mean (SD) right CCA diameter was 9.3 +/- 1.2 in AAA patients vs 8.1 +/- 1 mm in TAA patients (P < .0001) and 7.9 +/- 0.9 mm in controls. Mean left CCA diameter was 9.3 +/- 1.2 mm in AAA patients vs 8.1+/- 0.8 mm in TAA patients (P < .0001) and 7.9 +/- 0.8 mm in controls. There was no significant difference in SMA morphology among the three groups: AAA, 8.6 +/- 1.1; TAA, 8.3 +/- .9; and controls, 8.4 +/- 0.9 mm. Multifactorial modeling accounting for risk factors, age, and gender confirmed that the diameter difference between groups retained independent statistical significance.\nThis study provides further convincing evidence for a systemic dilating diathesis of elastic arteries in AAAs. It also highlights the differing natures of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease.\nA clear understanding of the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysms is essential. Observational studies have raised the suspicion that abdominal aortic aneurysms are a local representation of a systemic disease of the vasculature. Whether aneurysms of the thoracic aorta have a similar systemic tendency is unknown. Validation of this will open broader avenues of research clarifying understanding of the initiating factors of aneurysms and whether all aneurysms distributed through the arterial tree share the same etiology. This may in turn identify systemic treatments that eventually may allow targeted pharmaceutical management of small aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including JNK, p38, and ERK1/2, noticeably influence ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). The complement inhibitor dextran sulfate (DXS) associates with damaged endothelium denudated of its heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) layer. Other glycosaminoglycan analogs are known to influence MAPK signaling. Hypothetically therefore, targeted intravascular cytoprotection by DXS may function in part through influencing MAPK activation to reduce IRI-induced damage of the vasculature.\nIRI of the infrarenal aorta of male Wistar rats was induced by 90 minutes clamping followed by 120 minutes reperfusion. DXS (5 mg/mL) or physiologic saline (NaCl controls) was infused locally into the ischemic aortic segment immediately prior to reperfusion. Ninety minutes ischemia-only and heparinase infusion (maximal damage) experiments, as well as native rat aorta, served as controls. Aortas were excised following termination of the experiments for further analysis.\nDXS significantly inhibited IRI-induced JNK and ERK1/2 activation (P = .043; P =.005) without influencing the p38 pathway (P =.110). Reduced aortic injury, with significant inhibition of apoptosis (P = .032 for DXS vs NaCl), correlated with decreased nuclear factor kappaB translocation within the aortic wall. DXS treatment clearly reduced C1q, C4b/c, C3b/c, and C9 complement deposition, whilst preserving endothelial cell integrity and reducing reperfusion-induced HSPG shedding. Protection was associated with binding of fluorescein labeled DXS to ischemically damaged tissue.\nLocal application of DXS into ischemic vasculature immediately prior to reperfusion reduces complement deposition and preserves endothelial integrity, partially through modulating activation of MAPKs and may offer a new approach to tackle IRI in vascular surgical procedures.\nThe purpose of the present study was to determine the role of dextran sulfate (DXS), a glycosaminoglycan analog and complement inhibitor, in modulating intracellular MAPK signaling pathways, reducing complement activation and ultimately attenuating ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) in a rat aortic-clamping model, in part a surrogate model to study the microvasculature. The study shows a role for DXS in ameliorating endothelial injury by reducing IRI-mediated damage and intravascular, local inflammation in the affected aortic segment. DXS may be envisaged as an endothelial protectant in vascular injury, such as occurs during vascular surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory responses to vascular injury are key events in vein graft disease and accelerated atherosclerosis, which may result in bypass failure. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 pathway is hypothesized to play a central role. A murine model for vein graft disease was used to study the effect of local application of lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted against CCR2.\nA venous interposition was placed into the carotid artery of hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E3-Leiden (APOE*3-Leiden) mice to induce vein graft thickening with features of accelerated atherosclerosis. To demonstrate the efficacy of the lentiviral shRNA targeting murine CCR2 (shCCR2) in blocking vein graft disease in vivo, lentiviral shCCR2 or a control lentivirus was used to infect the vein graft locally (n = 8).\nVascular CCR2 and MCP-1 messenger RNA expression levels were significantly upregulated during lesion progression in the vein graft. Infection of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) with a lentiviral shRNA targeting shCCR2 completely abolished MCP-1-induced SMC migration and inhibited SMC proliferation in vitro (n = 3 per group). Morphometric analysis of sections of grafts showed a significant 38% reduction in vein graft thickening in the shCCR2-treated mice 4 weeks after surgery (control, 0.42 +/- 0.05 mm(2); shCCR2, 0.26 +/- 0.03 mm(2); P = .007).\nVascular CCR2 contributes to vein graft disease, and local application of shRNA against CCR2 to the vessel wall prevents vein graft thickening in hypercholesterolemic mice, suggesting that local overexpressing of shRNA using organ-targeted lentiviral gene delivery may be a promising therapeutic tool to improve vein graft disease in bypassed patients.\nVein graft disease is an important clinical issue that results from an inflammatory response. The monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1/CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 pathway plays a key role in the initiation and development of vein graft disease. This study demonstrates that perivascular overexpression of short hairpin RNA, targeted against CCR2, inhibits vein graft thickening. These data show that organ-targeted gene therapy against CCR2 in the vessel wall could be a promising therapeutic tool to improve vein graft patency in bypassed patients.",

    "abstract": "Celiac artery compression syndrome (CACS) can be treated successfully by division of the median arcuate ligament and celiac plexus fibers. The standard technique is the open approach by an upper midline or left subcostal incision. Only six single cases in which a laparoscopic transabdominal approach for CACS was used have been reported. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of the endoscopic retroperitoneal approach for treatment of CACS.\nAll patients with symptoms suggestive of CACS were evaluated using splanchnic duplex ultrasound scanning, gastric exercise tonometry (GET), and multiplane selective splanchnic angiography. The criteria for treatment were chronic abdominal symptoms, respiratory-dependent CA stenosis, and abnormal GET result. The release was performed by a retroperitoneal endoscopic approach. Anatomic success of the procedure was confirmed by angiography.\nThe endoscopic retroperitoneal approach was used to treat 46 patients with CACS. One patient (2%) required conversion to an open procedure due to suprarenal artery bleeding. Release was ended prematurely in one patient due to a pneumothorax resulting in loss of working space. A postoperative pneumothorax developed in two patients, of which one needed treatment. No other complications were observed. Postoperative angiography during inspiration and expiration showed normal vessel anatomy in 36 of 46 patients. Six of 10 patients with persisting intraluminal stenoses were treated endovascularly. Five of these were successful, which brings the primary-assisted anatomic patency for the total group to 89% (41 of 46 patients). Three patients are being observed, and endovascular treatment remains an option in case of insufficient improvement. On median follow-up of 20 months (range, 2-42 months) 41 patients were free of symptoms or showed significant improvement.\nThe endoscopic retroperitoneal approach for the release of the CA in CACS, with additional endovascular treatment of persistent stenosis, is feasible and effective. Short-term results were comparable with the open procedure.",

    "abstract": "Celiac artery compression syndrome (CACS) is an unusual condition caused by abnormally low insertion of the median fibrous arcuate ligament and muscular diaphragmatic fiber resulting in luminal narrowing of the celiac trunk. Surgical treatment is the release of the extrinsic compression by division of the median arcuate ligament overlying the celiac axis and skeletonization of the aorta and celiac trunk. The laparoscopic approach has been recently reported for single cases. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting of the CA alone, before or after the surgical relief of external compression to the celiac axis, has also been used. We report our 7-year experience with the laparoscopic management of CACS caused by the median arcuate ligament.\nBetween July 2001 and May 2008, 16 patients (5 men; mean age, 52 years) were treated. Diagnosis was made by duplex ultrasound scan and angiogram (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance). The mean body mass index of the patients was 21.2 kg/m(2). One patient underwent laparoscopic surgery after failure of PTA and stenting of the CA, and two patients after a stenting attempt failed.\nAll procedural steps were laparoscopically completed, and the celiac trunk was skeletonized. The laparoscopic procedures lasted a mean of 90 minutes. Two cases were converted to open surgery for bleeding at the end of the operation when high energies were used. The postoperative course was uneventful. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 3 days. On follow-up, 14 patients remained asymptomatic, with postoperative CT angiogram showing no residual stenosis of the celiac trunk. One patient had restenosis and underwent aortoceliac artery bypass grafting after 3 months. Another patient had PTA and stenting 2 months after laparoscopic operation. All patients reported complete resolution of symptoms at a mean follow-up of 28.3 months.\nThe laparoscopic approach to CACS appears to be feasible, safe, and successful, if performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. PTA and stenting resulted in a valid complementary procedure only when performed after the release of the extrinsic compression on the CA. Additional patients with longer follow-up are needed.",

    "abstract": "Celiac artery compression syndrome (CACS) remains a controversial diagnosis, despite several reported series documenting therapeutic efficacy of CA decompression. Traditional therapy consists of open surgical decompression, but since 2000, five isolated case reports have been published in which CACS has been successfully treated with laparoscopic techniques. This approach was adopted as the sole initial therapy for CACS at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 2002. This article reports the results of a unique surgical series that triples the reported worldwide experience with this therapy.\nFifteen patients (median age, 40.6 years) diagnosed with CACS underwent laparoscopic decompression by a single vascular surgeon. CACS was diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography in 14 patients and computed tomography (CT) angiography in one patient, with images acquired in both expiratory and inspiratory phases of respiration. CA decompression was offered after the results of a thorough workup for other pathology were negative, including upper and lower endoscopy, CT scanning, gastric and gallbladder emptying studies, upper gastrointestinal series, and small-bowel follow-through studies. Indications in all patients were abdominal pain and weight loss (average, 9 lbs). The procedure consisted of laparoscopic division of the median arcuate ligament and complete lysis of the CA from its origin on the aorta to its trifurcation.\nBetween November 2002 and September 2007, 15 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic CA decompression. Median length of follow-up was 44.2 months. There were no operative deaths. Four patients were converted intraoperatively to an open decompression, all for intraoperative bleeding; only one required a blood transfusion. Average operating time was 189 minutes, and the average length of stay was 3.5 days. CA intervention was required in six patients, including three intraoperative procedures (1 patch angioplasty, 1 celiac bypass, 1 percutaneous angioplasty) and six late procedures (2 percutaneous angioplasties, 3 percutaneous stents, 1 celiac bypass). One complication occurred, a severe case of pancreatitis that developed 1 week after discharge. On follow-up, 14 of 15 patients subjectively reported significant improvement, and one patient remains symptomatic with no diagnosis.\nLaparoscopic decompression of the CA may be a useful therapy for CACS, but there is potential for vascular injury, and adjunctive CA intervention is often required. Surgeons should consider laparoscopic CA decompression as a therapeutic alternative for CACS and should participate in the care of patients with this diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "A new physiopathologic concept within superficial venous insufficiency (SVI) describes ascending progression from the collaterals to the saphenous veins (SV), leading to a treatment that aims to remove the varicose reservoir and not the SVs. This study reports the midterm results of this therapeutic approach.\nThis is a retrospective study of patients treated for varices by phlebectomy with conservation of a refluxing SV before July 2004. We evaluated the varicose reservoir by determining the number of zones to be treated (NZT); each lower limb was divided into 32 zones in the preoperative mapping. We performed a clinical and duplex ultrasound examination after 6 months and 1 year, and then once a year until year 4.\nAmongst 811 lower limbs operated on for first-time varicose veins, 303 in 221 patients (55 men; 166 women), mean age, 52.7 years (range, 20-93 years), were treated by phlebectomy, with conservation of a refluxing SV. All lower limbs operated on presented preoperative SV reflux >0.5 seconds: great SV (GSV), 85.8%; small SV (SSV), 11.9%; and GSV and SSV, 2.3%. The average NZT was 6.05 (range, 2-10). SV reflux was reduced to < 0.5 seconds in 69.6%, 69.2%, 68.7%, 68.0%, and 66.3% of limbs, respectively, after 6 months, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of follow-up. Symptoms improved or disappeared in 84.2%, 84.2%, 83.4%, 81.4%, and 78.0% of limbs at each annual check-up until year 4. Freedom of varices recurrence was 95.5%, 94.6%, 91.5%, and 88.5%, respectively at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. When the NZT was >7, the postoperative varicose recurrence was more frequent (odds ratio, 6.82; P = .0001), and the postoperative elimination of SV reflux was more frequent (odds ratio, 4; P = .037) as was symptoms improvement (odds ratio, 2.91; P = .004). When an ostiotruncal SV reflux extended to the malleolus preoperatively, the elimination of the SV reflux was less frequent (47.6% vs 70.3%; P < .05).\nAblation of the varicose reservoir with conservation of a refluxing SV can be an effective treatment in the midterm for the signs and symptoms of SVI and leads to nonsignificant SV reflux in more than two of three cases. The extent of the varicose reservoir ablation is the key factor determining the hemodynamic and clinical efficacy of this more limited surgical approach.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a peripheral arterial disease manifested by drastically diminished blood flow to the legs, pain at rest, nonhealing wounds, and gangrene caused by atherosclerosis. Significant tissue necrosis is associated with late stage CLI and the patients have a poor prognosis. Necrotic and apoptotic cells activate complement and bind complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). The major isoform of C4BP is composed of seven identical alpha-chains and one beta-chain, here termed C4BP(beta), whereas upon inflammation a normally less abundant isoform is upregulated that is exclusively composed of alpha-chains. Measuring the alpha-chains of C4BP includes both isoforms and is termed total C4BP (C4BP(tot)). The hypothesis of this study was that levels of complement activation and C4BP are predictive for the severity of the disease and that their measurement might be of clinical advantage.\nThis was a prospective, single-center study of 259 consecutive patients with CLI admitted to a secondary referral center for vascular diseases. Interventions included evaluation of soluble terminal complement complexes (C5b-9), C4BP(tot) and C4BP(beta), lipid levels, the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, neopterin, plasma homocysteine, and plasma endothelin-1 in plasma as well as resistance to activated protein C and ankle blood pressure. All data were compared with an age-matched population based control group of 219 currently healthy individuals.\nThe data are presented as mean +/- SEM/median. CLI patients showed systemic complement activation (1.17 +/- 0.06/1.13 AU/mL vs 0.69 +/- 0.07/0.59 AU/mL in healthy controls, P < .0001), which was even higher in patients with gangrene (1.33 +/- 0.11/1.28 AU/mL vs 1.1 +/- 0.08/1.0 AU/mL, P = .0264), who also showed increased C4BP levels (421 +/- 28.6/386 microg/mL vs 341 +/- 10.8/318 microg/mL for C4BP(tot), P = .0248; 374 +/- 25.4/332 microg/mL vs 305 +/- 9.5/285 microg/mL for C4BP(beta), P = .0581). C4BP plasma levels were significantly elevated in CLI patients in comparison to healthy controls (351 +/- 8.1/322 microg/mL vs 297 +/- 8.0/288 microg/mL for C4BP(tot), P = .0001; 314 +/- 7.0/287 microg/mL vs 265 +/- 7.0/263 microg/mL for C4BP(beta), P = .0004) and correlated to levels of interleukin-6 (P(tot/beta) = .0048/.0019), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P < .0001), leukocyte (P(tot/beta) = .0086/.0043) and platelet count (P = .0001), LDL/HDL ratio (P(tot) = .0151) and HDL (P(tot/beta) = .0047/.0177), but not to tumor necrosis factor-alpha.\nIncreased complement activation and C4BP plasma levels are related to the degree of tissue necrosis and disease severity of critical limb ischemia. This knowledge in combination with the found correlations to other biomarkers is useful for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease.",

    "abstract": "We investigated an association between adiponectin and long-term survival in patients requiring an arterial bypass operation for peripheral arterial disease.\nAn enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to measure plasma adiponectin levels in 49 patients (38 men, 11 women) before they underwent an arterial bypass operation. Median patient age was 70 years (range, 49-90 years). The study excluded patients with hemodialysis requirement, heart failure, malignant neoplasm, or collagen disease. The symptoms at the first visit were severe intermittent claudication in 27 patients (55%) and critical limb ischemia with rest pain or ulcer, or both, in 22 (45%).\nPlasma adiponectin levels were a mean 7.8 +/- 5.3 microg/mL (range, 1.0-25.2 microg/mL). Multiple regression analyses revealed that plasma adiponectin was positively correlated with age (r = 0.49, P = .0003) and negatively correlated with body mass index (r = -0.51, P = .0002) and systolic blood pressure (r = -0.41, P = .0059). The Cox proportional hazards model revealed that plasma adiponectin (hazard ratio, 1.30; P = .03) and critical limb ischemia (hazard ratio, 16.67; P = .047) were significant independent predictors of patient survival after a bypass operation.\nPlasma adiponectin could be indicative of mortality after a bypass operation for patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of walking distance by treadmill testing is the most commonly used method to evaluate the effect of treatment in patients with peripheral arterial disease. However, treadmill testing is time consuming, relatively expensive, and does not adequately reflect real life functional ability. We hypothesized that the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) could be an alternative tool to assess objective improvement in functional walking ability of patients with intermittent claudication.\nThis was a validation study. It was conducted through the outpatient clinic for vascular surgery. Patients with intermittent claudication were referred for supervised exercise therapy. Treadmill testing (absolute claudication distance [ACD]), WIQ, and quality of life questionnaires (RAND-36 and EuroQol) were administered at study onset and after 3 months of supervised exercise therapy. Responsiveness was determined by mean changes in and correlation coefficients of WIQ, ACD, and quality of life questionnaires. Patients were categorized into quartiles based on the increase in ACD, which were subsequently related to change in WIQ and quality of life.\nThe mean pre- and post-treatment total WIQ scores of 91 patients were 0.45 (0.22) and 0.58 (0.22), respectively. The correlation coefficient between the change in total WIQ score and ACD was 0.331 (P = .004). A 0.1 change in total WIQ score corresponded to a change of 345 meters in ACD. Analysis of the four quartiles compared to an increase in ACD showed that a greater increase in ACD corresponded with a greater increase in WIQ score, from 0.06 to 0.25 (P = .011).\nThese data indicate that the WIQ is a valid tool to detect improvement or deterioration in the daily walking ability of patients with intermittent claudication. Hence, the WIQ can be used as an alternative to treadmill testing for objective assessment of functional walking ability, both in daily practice and in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The addition of a distal arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) to improve patency in lower extremity bypass is well described. This report describes a technique of using a distal AVF to enhance a distal vein patch (DVP) in patients without adequate autogenous conduit and who have concomitant severely disadvantaged arterial runoff.\nA retrospective review from May 2002 to May 2007 analyzed 270 tibial bypasses. DVP-AVF was the conduit in 30 bypass grafts. Patient demographics included 16 men, 14 women, diabetes mellitus (67%), and chronic renal failure (20%). All patients had limb-threatening ischemia manifest as rest pain or tissue loss, with 20 patients referred after failed prior revascularization: 11 failed bypasses, and nine failed endovascular interventions. In each case, the only outflow artery available was an isolated tibial segment or a diseased pedal vessel not ordinarily deemed suitable for bypass. At surgery, a common ostium AVF was created between the outflow tibial artery and corresponding tibial vein before DVP construction. Follow-up was 1 to 24 months, with graft function evaluated by pulse examination and duplex surveillance. Primary patency and limb salvage +/- SE were determined by life-table analysis using Rutherford criteria.\nThe proximal anastomosis originated from the external iliac (23%), common femoral artery (43%), and superficial femoral artery (33%). Outflow arteries included the anterior tibial (40%), posterior tibial (30%), and peroneal (30%). Venous hypertension in the bypassed limb was noted, but not considered problematic in any patient. Perioperative graft failure occurred in one patient. Six graft failures led to six major amputations (1 above knee; 5 below knee). One patent graft was excised due to infection. Primary patency at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 78.3% +/- 6.8%, 78.3% +/- 10.5%, 62.6% +/- 11.1%, and 62.6% +/- 15.6%; limb salvage was 78.7% +/- 6.7%, 78.7% +/- 10.1%, 78.7% +/- 10.1%, and 57.7% +/- 12.5%.\nThis early experience describes a modification of the DVP technique in patients with threatened limb loss and severely disadvantaged tibial runoff. The addition of an AVF may reduce outflow resistance, thereby contributing to higher flow rates and improved graft patency. Further investigation is warranted because the DVP-AVF technique may result in acceptable graft patency and limb salvage for patients with no other alternative than amputation.",

    "abstract": "To assess the association of perioperative cardiac dysfunction during elective vascular surgery with postoperative outcome.\nPatients with normal systolic function can have isolated diastolic dysfunction. Routine preoperative evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function does not include an assessment of diastolic function for risk stratification. We hypothesized that perioperative assessment of both diastolic and systolic function with transesophageal echo (TEE) may improve our ability to predict postoperative outcome.\nPerioperative TEE examinations were carried out on patients undergoing elective vascular surgery under general anesthesia. Abnormal systolic function was defined as LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%. Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed using transmitral flow propagation velocity (Vp); Vp <45 cm/sec was considered abnormal. We determined the association between LV function and the primary outcome of postoperative adverse outcome, defined as one or more adverse events: myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), significant arrhythmia, prolonged intubation, renal failure, and death.\nThree hundred thirteen patients undergoing vascular surgery were studied. We found that 8% (n = 24) of patients had isolated systolic dysfunction, 43% (n = 134) had isolated diastolic dysfunction, and 24% (n = 75) both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The most common postoperative adverse outcome was CHF 20% (n = 62). By multivariate logistic regression, we found that patient age, Vp, type of surgery, female gender, and renal failure were predictive of postoperative adverse outcome.\nThe presence of perioperative diastolic dysfunction as assessed with Vp is an independent predictor of postoperative CHF and prolonged length of stay after major vascular surgery. Patient age, gender, type of surgery, and renal failure were also predictors of outcome. Perioperative systolic function was not a predictor of postoperative outcome in our patients.",

    "abstract": "Hostile neck anatomy is assumed to be associated with increased surgical risk for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and is often considered a reason to choose carotid stenting or medical management. This retrospective case-control study evaluated whether, and how much, anatomically hostile necks represent a condition of higher surgical risk of early and late mortality and major or minor morbidity.\nThe data for 966 homogeneous CEA patients was prospectively entered in a computer database. Seventy-seven had a hostile neck anatomy due to previous oncologic surgery or neck irradiation, restenoses after CEA, high carotid bifurcation, or bull-like and inextensible neck. A case-control matched-pair cohort study considered sex, age (5-year intervals), and year of operation. Regional anesthesia was used for all operations for atherosclerotic stenosis >or=70%, conforming to the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, at a single center and by one surgeon or under his direct supervision.\nThe hostile neck patients and the control group were matched for age, sex, carotid-related symptoms, degree of stenoses, and main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Intraoperative variables were substantially equivalent in the two groups; however, procedure length and clamping time were, respectively, about 22 minutes (P = .0001) and 7 minutes longer (P = .01) in the hostile neck group. Rates of postoperative mortality and neurologic events were equivalent. Peripheral nerve lesions were multiple and significantly more frequent in the hostile neck patients (21% with >or=1 cranial nerve lesion vs 7% of controls, P = .03), yet all were transient and limited to a few months. The subgroups of patients with hostile neck, restenoses, and bull-like inextensible necks required the longest operative and clamping time, and those with bull-like and high bifurcation had the most frequent cranial nerve dysfunctions. At the respective follow-up of 47 and 45 months, survival curves (P = .48) and the incidence of restenoses and fatal and nonfatal strokes were similar (5 and 4, respectively).\nHostile necks led to more complex CEA procedures but without substantial consequences in early and late morbidity and mortality. Most patients with hostile neck can undergo CEA at low risk, with the benefit of effective long-lasting stroke prevention similar to standard patients. In our opinion, the more frequent but temporary cranial nerve dysfunctions that occur are not sufficient to consider hostile neck patients noneligible for CEA.",

    "abstract": "Graft excision and neo-aortoiliac system (NAIS) reconstruction with large caliber, femoral popliteal vein (FPV) grafts have been reported as successful treatment of aortic graft infection (AGI) in several small series with limited follow-up. The goal of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes in large cohort of consecutive patients treated with NAIS for AGI.\nFrom 1990 to 2006, 187 patients (age: 63 +/- 10 years) with AGI were treated with in situ reconstructions using 336 FPV grafts. Data from a prospectively maintained data base were analyzed.\nNAIS reconstruction was performed for 144 infected aortofemoral bypasses, 21 infected aortic-iliac grafts, and 22 infected axillofemoral bypasses that had been placed to treat AGI. Polymicrobial cultures were present in 37% while 17% showed no growth. There were 55% gram positive, 32% gram negative, 13% anaerobic, and 18% fungal infections. The mean Society for Vascular Surgery run-off resistance score was 4.5 +/- 2.3. Concomitant infrainguinal bypass was necessary in 27 (14%) patients (32 limbs). Major amputations were performed in 14 (7.4%) patients. Out of 14 amputations, five patients had irreversible ischemia and in four, there was no conduit available. Graft disruption from reinfection occurred in 10 patients (5%). While 30-day mortality was 10%, procedure-related mortality was 14%. Independent risk factors for perioperative death on multivariate analysis were: preoperative sepsis (odds ratio [OR] 3.5) ASA class 4 (OR 2.9), Candida species (OR 3.4), Candida glabrata (OR 7.6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (OR 3.5), and Bacteroides fragilis (OR 4.1). Perioperative factors included use of platelets (OR 2.4), blood loss >3.0 liters (OR 9.5). Cumulative primary patency at 72 months was 81%; secondary/assisted primary patency was 91%. Limb salvage at 72 months was 89%. Five-year survival was 52%.\nThese results compare favorably with other methods of treating AGI, especially in patients with multilevel occlusive disease. Principle advantages include acceptable perioperative mortality, low amputation rate, superior durability with excellent long-term patency, and freedom from secondary interventions and recurrent infections.",

Ten patients declined and 2 patients had chronic kidney failure, leaving a total of 247 patients. Inclusion criteria were: AAA 35-49 mm and age <80 years. Patients were randomized to receive either azithromycin (Azithromax, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) 600 mg once daily for 3 days and then 600 mg once weekly for 15 weeks, or placebo in identical tablets. The ultrasound scans were performed in a standardized way within a month before inclusion and every 6 months for a minimum follow-up time of 18 months. Cpn serology was analyzed in blood samples taken at inclusion and 6 months later. Serum was analyzed for Cpn IgA and IgG antibodies by microimmunofluorescence (MIF). Computed tomography (CT) scans were done in 66 patients at inclusion and at 1 year for volume calculations.\nThirty-four patients were excluded, ie, could not be followed for 18 months, 20 in the placebo group and 16 in the active treatment group. A total of 211 patients had at least two measurements and all were analyzed in an intention-to-treat analysis. Detectable IgA against Cpn was found in 115 patients and detectable IgG against Cpn in 160 patients. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups regarding median expansion rate measured by ultrasound scan (0.22 cm/year, interquartile range [IQR]: 0.09 to 0.34 in the placebo group vs 0.22, IQR: 0.12 to 0.36 in the treatment group, P = .85). Volume calculation did not change that outcome (10.4 cm(3)/year in the placebo group vs 15.9 cm(3)/year in the treatment group, P = .61).

    "abstract": "Hybrid repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) may reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk candidates for open repair. This study reviews the outcomes of hybrid TAAA repair for Crawford extent I-III TAAA in high-risk patients in comparison to patients who underwent concurrent open TAAA repair.\nDuring the interval from June 2005 to December 2007, a total of 23 high-risk patients with TAAA (type I: 9 [39%], II: 5 [22%], and III: 9 [39%]) underwent renal and/or mesenteric debranching (11 [48%] with four vessel debranching) with subsequent placement of a thoracic stent graft; 77 patients underwent open TAAA repair (type I: 13 [17%], II: 11 [14%], III: 27 [35%], and IV: 26 [34%]) during the same interval. The primary high-risk criteria for hybrid TAAA included advanced age/poor functional status (n = 14), major pulmonary dysfunction (n = 8), and technical consideration (prior thoracic aortic aneurysm repair [n = 4] or prior thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair [n = 2] and obesity [n = 2]) with 6 patients having overlapping high-risk criteria. Composite (30-day) mortality and/or permanent paraplegia (PP) were the major study endpoints.\nThe hybrid and open TAAA groups had (respectively) no statistical difference in mean age (76.6 vs 72.7 years), aneurysm size (6.51 vs 6.52 cm), and non-elective operation (30.4% vs 26.0%). The hybrid group had a higher mean Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) risk score (9.1 vs 6.0; P <or= .001), incidence of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (34.8% vs 2.6%; P <or= .001), and prior thoracic (n = 4) or thoracoabdominal (n = 2) repair (26.1% vs 1.3%; P <or= .001). Composite mortality and/or PP was doubled in the hybrid group (21.7% vs 11.7%; P = .33). The rate of any type of reoperation was higher in hybrid TAAA repair (39.1% vs 20.8%; P = .03). One year actuarial survival for both groups was comparable (hybrid, 68 +/- 12%; open, 73 +/- 6%). A total of 5/23 (22%) hybrid TAAA patients developed an endoleak (type I: 3/23 and type II: 2/23) with 3 requiring endovascular re-intervention. A total of 7/70 (10%) visceral/renal bypass grafts were noted to be occluded during follow-up (1 superior mesenteric artery, 1 celiac, and 5 renal). Examination of patients with an SVS risk score <or=8 (mean SVS risk score in hybrid 6.2 [n = 10] vs 5.5 [n = 68] in open; P = .27) revealed the hybrid group had a higher incidence of composite mortality and/or PP (40% vs 10.3%; P = .03).\nHybrid TAAA repair in high-risk patients has significant morbidity and mortality suggesting a non-interventional approach may be appropriate in many such patients. The morbidity and mortality of the hybrid TAAA repair was substantial even in lower risk patients (SVS risk score <or=8), albeit patient numbers were small. Prospective study in comparable patient risk cohorts is required to define the role of hybrid TAAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Open abdomen treatment (OAT) is considered a lifesaving procedure in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) after endovascular or open intervention for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA). Standardized treatment methods and algorithms for its use are still lacking. The high, published mortality rates may reflect difficulties in detecting and treating ACS, especially in patients treated by emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR). Presented are standardized algorithms for OAT, including a new technique using the vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system developed during 10 years of experience with eEVAR for RAAA.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 102 patients with RAAA treated by eEVAR from January 1998 to April 2008. Abdominal decompression was done when intravesical pressure >20 mm Hg or when abdominal perfusion pressure was <50 to 60 mm Hg and concomitant organ deterioration occurred. OAT was initially done with a subcutaneously sutured plastic bag or with a nonsutured zipper drape combined with a VAC device (VAC/ETHIZIP; KCI International Inc, Amstelveen, The Netherlands; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). All patients were switched to VAC/ETHIZIP as soon as possible. Dressings were generally changed every 3 to 5 days. Intra-abdominal pressure was monitored until stability was observed after delayed direct abdominal closure.\nOverall 30-day mortality for eEVAR was 13% (13 of 102); 8% (7 of 82) for patients without ACS and 30% (6 of 20) for those with ACS. Decompression for ACS was needed in 20 patients (20%) primarily during the intervention (n = 14) or secondarily in the intensive care unit (n = 6). Six of 20 (30%) patients requiring OAT died <or=30 days (4 primary, 2 secondary). A mean of 3.6 (range, 1-12) planned second-look interventions were done per patient at an interval of 3 to 5 days.

    "abstract": "Advances in endovascular interventions have expanded the options available for the invasive treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Whether endovascular interventions substitute for conventional bypass surgery or are simply additive has not been investigated, and their effect on amputation rates is unknown.\nWe sought to analyze trends in lower extremity endovascular interventions (angioplasty and atherectomy), lower extremity bypass surgery, and major amputation (above and below-knee) in Medicare beneficiaries between 1996 and 2006. We used 100% samples of Medicare Part B claims to calculate annual procedure rates of lower extremity bypass surgery, endovascular interventions (angioplasty and atherectomy), and major amputation between 1996 and 2006. Using physician specialty identifiers, we also examined trends in the specialty performing the primary procedure.\nBetween 1996 and 2006, the rate of major lower extremity amputation declined significantly (263 to 188 per 100,000; risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-0.8). Endovascular interventions increased more than threefold (from 138 to 455 per 100,000; RR = 3.30; 95% CI: 2.9-3.7) while bypass surgery decreased by 42% (219 to 126 per 100,000; RR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.5-0.7). The increase in endovascular interventions consisted both of a growth in peripheral angioplasty (from 135 to 337 procedures per 100,000; RR = 2.49; 95% CI: 2.2-2.8) and the advent of percutaneous atherectomy (from 3 to 118 per 100,000; RR = 43.12; 95% CI: 34.8-52.0). While radiologists performed the majority of endovascular interventions in 1996, more than 80% were performed by cardiologists and vascular surgeons by 2006. Overall, the total number of all lower extremity vascular procedures almost doubled over the decade (from 357 to 581 per 100,000; RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.5-1.8).\nEndovascular interventions are now performed much more commonly than bypass surgery in the treatment of lower extremity PAD. These changes far exceed simple substitution, as more than three additional endovascular interventions were performed for every one procedure declined in lower extremity bypass surgery. During this same time period, major lower extremity amputation rates have fallen by more than 25%. However, further study is needed before any causal link can be established between lower extremity vascular procedures and improved rates of limb salvage in patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery stent placement is a recognized treatment for patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis when medical therapy fails. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) is the primary method used for noninvasive assessment of renal artery patency. Arterial stents alter the compliance of the artery, which could make the standard reference values, based on native renal artery velocities, inaccurate. This study attempted to determine DUS criteria for renal artery in-stent restenosis (ISR).\nWe studied 67 consecutive patients with suspected renal artery ISR based on abnormal renal DUS results, defined as peak systolic velocity (PSV) >or=200 cm/s and renal/aortic velocity ratio (RAR) >or=3.5. The ISR patients were compared with 55 consecutive nonstented patients who underwent renal DUS evaluation and renal angiography. Those with >or=50% angiographic narrowing in each group were analyzed, and renal PSV and RAR were compared.\nIn the 67 patients with renal stents and 55 patients without renal stents, a statistically significant correlation was found for both PSV and RAR in detecting renal ISR and renal artery stenosis as defined by quantitative angiography (P = .02). For any level of angiographic stenosis >or=50%, the ISR group had relatively higher PSV and RAR compared with the nonstented group. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that PSV >or=395 cm/s or RAR >or=5.1 were the most predictive of angiographically significant ISR >or=70%.\nThe current DUS criteria for native renal arteries may overestimate the degree of angiographic ISR due to changes in compliance. We recommend that DUS laboratories make adjustments in PSV and RAR obtained by DUS when monitoring the patency of renal stents for ISR.",

    "abstract": "Platelet function exhibits circadian variation with highest levels of activity in the morning and plays a central role in arterial thrombotic events, including thrombotic stroke following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Prior to the platelet-rich thrombus occluding the carotid artery, multiple embolic signals are detected in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. We hypothesized that patients undergoing CEA early in the day may be at an increased stroke risk and this would manifest as an increased postoperative embolic count.\nData were collected prospectively on 235 patients undergoing primary CEA. Accurate start and finish times were recorded in addition to the number of postoperative emboli detected in the first three hours after CEA using transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring.\nFor operations finishing before midday, there was a 3.6-fold increase in the number of emboli detected relative to afternoon finishes (53.2 vs 14.8, P = .002) with similar results for starts before 10:30 AM (48.1 vs 14.7, P =.002). There was also a significant correlation between start time and emboli count (P = .02). Of the 55 patients with no postoperative emboli, only 19 had a morning start (relative risk 0.63, P = .011). Patients were 6.9 times more likely to require treatment with Dextran-40 to prevent progression onto a thrombotic stroke if their CEA finished before midday (P = .008).\nThere is a significantly increased rate of postoperative embolization for operations begun earlier in the day.

The metabolic syndrome is a frequent condition among patients with manifest vascular disease, but the influence of the metabolic syndrome on cardiovascular events in patients with PAOD is unknown. Also, progression and regression of the metabolic syndrome after follow-up are not extensively studied.\nThe study population consisted of 461 patients with symptomatic PAOD from the Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease study (SMART). Patients underwent vascular screening at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 5.5 +/- 1.3 years. Hazard ratios (HRs) for vascular events according to metabolic syndrome status (updated National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] criteria) were calculated using Cox regression analysis. The course of the metabolic syndrome during follow-up and the influence of body mass index (BMI) on development or disappearance of the syndrome were assessed.\nDuring follow-up, 91 first vascular events were recorded. Cumulative 3-year survival free from vascular events was 84.7% in metabolic syndrome patients compared to 92.1% in participants without the syndrome. The metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of vascular events (HR 1.51; 1.01-2.30, age- and gender-adjusted). During follow-up, 128 patients died or were lost to follow-up, and of 333 remaining patients, 221 participated in follow-up measurements. The metabolic syndrome disappeared in 16% of patients and was incident in 14% of patients during follow-up. Waist circumference increased with 10 +/- 8 cm in those developing the syndrome. A BMI decrease of 1 kg/m(2) significantly decreased the risk of metabolic syndrome development by 23% (odds ratio [OR] 0.77; 0.62-0.96), and increased the chance to revert to a non-metabolic syndrome state by 32% (OR 1.32; 1.03-1.71).\nThe metabolic syndrome is associated with a 1.5-fold increase in risk of vascular events in PAOD patients. Weight control reduces metabolic syndrome incidence and increases metabolic syndrome resolution during follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Open vascular surgical procedures have decreased since the advent of endovascular repair. Advances in spinal fusion techniques and artificial disc replacement have led to an increase in the need for anterior retroperitoneal exposure of the lumbar spine (ARES). Vascular surgeons participate as \"exposure surgeons\" for these cases due to their unique skills in dealing with retroperitoneal structures. We report a single center experience with this procedure and focus on injury pattern and preservation of open surgical training.\nPatients undergoing ARES over an 8-year period were identified from our vascular registry. A two-team approach involving a vascular surgeon and spine surgeon has been routinely employed. ARES was performed for anterior lumbar interbody fusion or total disc replacement. The intraoperative techniques of vascular manipulation were reviewed. The need for suture repair of vascular structures and the incidence and timing of serious vascular injury was recorded.\nFour-hundred and five ARES procedures were performed. The levels exposed included L5-S1 alone (128), L4-5 (54), 4-5 and 5-S1 (139), and other combinations in 84 cases. The exposure involved the L4-5 disc in 243 cases (60%). Exposure of L4-5 was accomplished above the left common iliac artery (CIA) in 44%, between the left CIA and common iliac vein (CIV) in 45%, and below the left CIV in 11%. Minor vascular injuries (all venous) needing suture repair occurred in 24% of cases overall. Minor vascular injuries occurred during both exposure (43%) and instrumentation (57%). Minor vascular injuries were significantly more frequent in cases involving the L4-5 disc than in those not involving L4-5 (31.7% vs 11.1%, P < .001). Serious, life-threatening, vascular injuries occurred in 12 patients (3%), all during instrumentation, and included left CIV laceration (seven cases), right CIV laceration (two cases), and inferior vena cava laceration, distal aortic plaque disruption and left CIA laceration in one case each. There was no association between body mass index, prior surgery, or type of instrumentation and the occurrence of minor or major vascular injuries. Postoperative vascular complications included three deep vein thromboses; two of which occurred in patients with CIV laceration.\nVascular expertise is important in anterior retroperitoneal lumbar spine exposure. Minor venous injuries frequently occur during exposure and instrumentation. Significant vascular injuries, while rare, occur during instrumentation, therefore the vascular surgeon should remain present throughout the entire procedure. The vascular manipulations required during exposure of the L4-5 disc offer an excellent opportunity for open vascular surgical experience. Vascular surgeon involvement in these cases allows for prompt repair of vascular injuries and provides opportunities for the vascular surgery resident to augment his/her open surgical training.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypotheses that women have greater impairment in calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO(2)) in response to exercise than men, and that the sex-related difference in calf muscle StO(2) would partially explain the shorter claudication distances of women.\nThe study comprised 27 men and 24 women with peripheral arterial disease limited by intermittent claudication. Patients were characterized on calf muscle StO(2) before, during, and after a graded treadmill test, as well as on demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, ankle-brachial index (ABI), ischemic window, initial claudication distance (ICD), and absolute claudication distance (ACD).\nWomen had a 45% lower ACD than men (296 +/- 268 m vs 539 +/- 288 m; P = .001) during the treadmill test. Calf muscle StO(2) declined more rapidly during exercise in women than in men; the time to reach minimum StO(2) occurred 54% sooner in women (226 +/- 241 vs 491 +/- 426 seconds; P = .010). The recovery time for calf muscle StO(2) to reach the resting value after treadmill exercise was prolonged in women (383 +/- 365 vs 201 +/- 206 seconds; P = .036). Predictors of ACD included the time from start of exercise to minimum calf muscle StO(2), the average rate of decline in StO(2) from rest to minimum StO(2) value, the recovery half-time of StO(2), and ABI (R(2) = 0.70; P < .001). The ACD of women remained lower after adjusting for ABI (mean difference, 209 m; P = .003), but was no longer significantly lower (mean difference, 72 m; P = .132) after further adjustment for the StO(2) variables for the three calf muscles.\nIn patients limited by intermittent claudication, women have lower ACD and greater impairment in calf muscle StO(2) during and after exercise than men, the exercise-mediated changes in calf muscle StO(2) are predictive of ACD, and women have similar ACD as men after adjusting for calf StO(2) and ABI measures.",

    "abstract": "Black patients have a higher mortality rate than nonblacks after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. We sought to understand the factors responsible for this racial disparity in the mortality rate after aneurysm repair.\nThe Medicare database (2001-2006) was used to identify 160,785 patients undergoing open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs. We used risk-adjusted mortality as our primary measure of quality and logistic regression to determine the relationship between race and mortality, sequentially adding contributing factors including patient characteristics, the type of repair (endovascular vs open repair), socioeconomic status, and hospital quality. From these sequential regression models, we estimated the proportion of the disparity that can be explained by each factor.\nBlack patients had a 36% higher risk-adjusted mortality after aneurysm repair than nonblack patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.53). Even after accounting for the type of repair, a significant difference in mortality remained (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.50). Mortality rates were higher in hospitals treating a higher proportion of black patients. Adjusting for these differences in hospital quality, this disparity was no longer significant (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25). We estimate that 29% of the observed disparity in mortality is caused by patient comorbidities, 6% from the use of endovascular repairs, 26% due to socioeconomic factors, and 25% because black patients receive care in lower-quality hospitals.\nAlthough many factors contribute, a large proportion of observed disparities in outcomes are attributable to black patients receiving care in lower-quality hospitals. Efforts aimed at improving disparities must focus on improved access to high-quality hospitals and improved resources at the hospitals that treat higher proportions of black patients.",

In this study, we reviewed market share trends and compared outcomes for each specialty using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS).\nPatient discharges for PAI (1998-2005) were identified based on ICD9-CM procedure codes. The provider's specialty was identified by a specialty-specific algorithm and analyzed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Market share trends and distribution of cases at teaching versus non-teaching hospitals were evaluated. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and iatrogenic arterial injuries (IAI). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of post-procedure morbidity and mortality.\nThe number of cases identified was 23,825. From 1998 to 2005, IR's market share decreased six-fold (1998: 33% to 2005: 5.6%) whereas VS market share increased from 27% to 43% and IC from 10% to 29% (P < .05). A similar but more pronounced trend was observed at teaching hospitals. In-hospital mortality rate was highest for IR (2.1 IR% vs 1.2% VS and 0.6% IC; P < .001). Post-procedure IAI was highest in the IC group (1.3% vs IR 0.9% and 0.5% VS; P < .05). Compared with VS, the mortality rate was 1.62 times higher for IR patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-2.24) and IAI was 2.44 times higher for IC (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.63-3.66) and 1.75 times higher for IR (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.08-2.81) patients.\nIR market share of PAI has precipitously declined while those of VS and IC have increased significantly. Vascular surgeons had the lowest overall morbidity and mortality of all groups. Increase in the number of endovascularly-trained VS with better access to fluoroscopy units may further increase VS's market share.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies showed that the direct injection of an adenovirus construct expressing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) into experimental venous thrombi significantly reduces thrombus weight. The systemic use of adenovirus vectors is limited by inherent hepatic tropism and inflammatory response.

The aims of this study were to determine whether macrophages transduced with ad-uPA have increased fibrinolytic activity and whether systemic injection of transduced cells could be used to target uPA expression to the thrombus and reduce its size.\nThe effect of up-regulating uPA was examined in an immortalized macrophage cell line (MM6) and macrophages differentiated from human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HBMMs). Cells were infected with ad-uPA or blank control virus (ad-blank). Fibrinolytic mediator expression, cell viability, and cytokine expression were measured by activity assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Monocyte migration was measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay. A model of venous thrombosis was developed and characterized in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This model was used to study whether systemically administered macrophages over-expressing uPA reduced thrombus size. Uptake of HBMMs into the thrombus induced in these mice was confirmed by a combination of PKH2-labeled cell tracking and colocalization with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) by immunohistology.\nCompared with ad-blank, treated HBMMs transduction with ad-uPA increased uPA production by >1000-fold (P = .003), uPA activity by 150-fold (P = .0001), and soluble uPA receptor (uPAR) by almost twofold (P = .043). Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and PAI-2 was decreased by about twofold (P = .011) and threefold (P = .005), respectively. Up-regulation of uPA had no effect on cell viability or inflammatory cytokine production compared with ad-blank or untreated cells. Ad-uPA transduction increased the migration rate of HBMMs (about 20%, P = .03) and MM6 cells (>twofold, P = .005) compared with ad-blank treated controls. Human macrophage recruitment into the mouse thrombus was confirmed by the colocalization of HLA with the PKH2-marked cells. Systemic injection of uPA-up-regulated HBMMs reduced thrombus weight by approximately 20% compared with ad-blank (P = .038) or sham-treated controls (P = .0028).\nTransduction of HBBM with ad-uPA increases their fibrinolytic activity. Systemic administration of uPA up-regulated HBBMs reduced thrombus size in an experimental model of venous thrombosis. Alternative methods of delivering fibrinolytic agents are worth exploring.",

The projected population for each decade was determined by U.S. Census Bureau figures. Some assumptions of this model included: (1) In 2008, the population was 300,000,000; (2) There were 2783 board certified VSN in 2008; (3) VSN will practice 30 years from board certification to retirement; (4) There will be 105 board certifications and 93 retirements per year; (5) Vascular operations will remain at 284 per 100,000 population; (6) Salaries of trainees will be $50,000 with benefits of 30% and $15,000 of additional direct medical education costs.\nPopulation and workload analysis suggests that there will be a shortage of 330 surgeons (9.8%) and 399 surgeons (11.6%) by 2030, respectively. The cost of training enough VSN (in a six-year program) by 2030 will be between $1,166,400,000 and $1,199,520,000.\nA conservative estimate by both population and workload analysis, disregarding aging of the population, lifestyle choices of future VSN, and increasing demand for services, indicates a shortage of VSN in the future. Unless the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is revised by Congress, the cost to train the additional VS workforce remains a significant barrier.",

    "abstract": "Inadequate iliac artery diameter, calcification, and tortuosity are associated with increased incidence of iliac injury during abdominal (EVAR) and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR). Despite careful preoperative assessment and use of iliac conduits, inadvertent iliac rupture is a source of morbidity and mortality. This report details our single-center, 10-year experience with intraoperative iliac artery rupture and describes a successful endovascular salvage technique.\nAll patients undergoing EVAR and TEVAR between August 1997 and June 2008 were reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) measurements of access vessels were obtained for all patients. The smallest diameter of the external or common iliac artery was used to determine suitability for access based on the instructions for use for each device. Patients who underwent repair of a procedure-related iliac artery rupture were identified. Outcomes among patients who did not have an access vessel rupture (nonruptured group) and those who did (ruptured group) were compared. Patency of the endovascular iliac repair is reported.\nDuring the study period, 369 EVARs and 67 TEVARs were performed. Eleven iliac conduits were used, all during TEVAR (16%). There were 18 ruptured iliac arteries in 17 patients; 11 EVAR patients (2.98%) sustained iliac rupture vs six TEVAR patients (8.9%). One EVAR patient was converted to open repair. Seventeen ruptures in 16 patients were successfully treated with endovascular stent graft placement. Iliac rupture was more likely to occur during TEVAR (8.9%) than EVAR (2.98%; P = .0239, Fisher exact test). Significantly more women were in the ruptured group (76% vs 19%; P < .0001, Fisher exact test). Patients in the ruptured group had longer lengths of stay (7.6 vs 5.1 days; P = .0895, t test), no 30-day mortality, but a procedure-related mortality of 11.8%. In the nonrupture group, 30-day mortality was 6.6% (4 of 61) and 2.8% (10 of 358) for TEVAR and EVAR, respectively, and procedure-related mortality was 9.8% (6 of 61) and 3.1% (11 of 358). For endovascular repair of iliac rupture, primary and primary-assisted patency was 88.2% and 94.1%, respectively, with median follow-up of 40 months (range 10-115 months).\nIliac rupture during EVAR or TEVAR can be successfully managed with endovascular stent grafting. Higher mortality and length of stay associated with iliac artery rupture confirm that there is no substitute for prevention. Access vessels of all patients undergoing EVAR should be examined closely for suitability. The threshold for using an iliac conduit, especially in women undergoing TEVAR, should be low.",

    "abstract": "Prior neck irradiation may induce atherosclerosis in the carotid artery and is considered an indication for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study sought to evaluate the effect of neck radiation therapy (XRT) on the rate of restenosis and embolic potential in patients undergoing CAS.\nTwo hundred ten CAS procedures were performed on 193 patients (XRT [N = 28], non-XRT [N = 182]). Mean follow-up was 347 +/- 339 days (median, 305 days; range, 16-1354 days). Duplex velocity criteria for restenosis after CAS were: >50% restenosis (peak systolic velocity [PSV] > 125 cm/sec, end diastolic velocity [EDV] 40-99 cm/sec, and internal carotid artery to common carotid artery systolic ratio [ICA/CCA] > 2.0); >70% restenosis (PSV>230 cm/sec, EDV>100 cm/sec, and ICA/CCA ratio >4.0). Restenosis >70% was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. Additional endpoints included groin hematoma, groin pseudoaneurysm, myocardial infarction, stroke, mortality, and the combined myocardial infarction/stroke/mortality rate. Captured particulate data was obtained from microporous filters used during CAS. Nineteen XRT and 128 non-XRT consecutive filters were analyzed. Photomicroscopy was performed along three axes for each filter, and the quantity and size of the captured particles were analyzed using video image analysis software.\nThere were more men (XRT: 85.7% vs. non-XRT: 52.8%, P < .001) and prior surgical neck dissections in the XRT patients (XRT: 82.1% vs. non-XRT: 4.7%, P < .001). Pre-procedural stenosis did not differ significantly betweeen the two groups (XRT: 86.5% +/- 8.9% [range, 70%-99%] vs. non-XRT: 85.5% +/- 8.7% [range 70%-99%], P = NS). Perioperative outcomes, including the composite 30 day stroke/myocardial infarction/mortality rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (XRT: 0% vs. non-XRT: 3.2%, P = NS). Twelve-month freedom from restenosis rates did not differ significantly at the 50% threshold (XRT: 95.5% vs. non-XRT: 90.3%, P = NS) or at the 70% threshold (XRT: 95.5% vs. non-XRT: 96.5%, P = NS). Target lesion revascularization did not differ significantly (XRT: 0% vs. non-XRT: 0.5%, P = NS). Photomicroscopy demonstrated a trend towards increased particle number and size in the XRT filters, however the results did not achieve statistical significance: particle number (XRT: 9.8 +/- 8.4 vs. non-XRT: 9.6 +/- 11.7, P = NS), %patients with particle size >1000 microm (XRT: 47.4% vs. non-XRT: 30.5%, P = NS).\nThis study suggests that the durability of CAS and the characteristics of captured embolic particles are not altered by a history of neck XRT. This supports the safety and efficacy of CAS for the treatment of patients with a history of neck XRT. Prior neck XRT may predispose the patient to the de novo development of stenoses at locations that were not previously treated.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been advocated as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in high-risk surgical patients, including stenosis after CEA. This study compared early and midterm clinical outcomes for primary CAS vs CAS for post-CEA stenosis.\nThis study analyzed 180 high-risk surgical patients: 68 had primary CAS (group A), and 112 had CAS for post-CEA stenosis (group B). Patients were followed-up prospectively and had duplex ultrasound imaging at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. All patients had cerebral protection devices. Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis was used to estimate rates of freedom from stroke, stroke-free survival, > or =50% in-stent stenosis, > or =80% in-stent stenosis, and target vessel reintervention (TVR).\nPatients had comparable demographic and clinical characteristics. Carotid stent locations were similar. Indications for CAS were transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or stroke in 50% for group A and 45% for group B. The mean follow-up was comparable, at 21 (range, 1-73) vs 25 (range, 1-78) months, respectively. The technical success rate was 100%. The perioperative stroke rates and combined stroke/death/myocardial infarction (MI) rates were 7.4% for group A vs 0.9% for group B (P = .0294). No perioperative MIs occurred in either group. One death was secondary to stroke. The combined early and late stroke rates were 10.8% for group A and 1.8% for group B (P = .0275). The stroke-free rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for groups A and B were 89%, 89%, 89%, and 89%; and 98%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively (P = .0105).

We report a case of aortic angiosarcoma masquerading as a descending thoracic aneurysm arising from a penetrating ulcer. The patient was initially treated with an endovascular stent graft for rapid growth, but the lesion continued to enlarge despite angiographic exclusion. FDG-PET CT scan and biopsy ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of aortic angiosarcoma. This case highlights some of the difficulties of making the early diagnosis of aortic angiosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "The theory of primary venous dilatation leading to secondary valvular incompetence and varicose vein formation has received more attention nowadays. Although many studies have investigated the role of the main components of the venous wall in the development of varicose veins, the leading cause remains unknown. The present study was designed to establish the role of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the tunica media on the pathogenesis of varicose veins by analyzing the phenotypic and functional differences between SMCs derived from varicose veins and normal veins.\nSMCs were isolated and cultured from saphenous veins of patients with varicose veins and normal veins. Cell proliferation and migration rates were compared. Expression of phenotype-dependent markers and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP) production were analyzed by immunoblotting. Total collagen synthesis was evaluated by measuring the radioactivity of L-[3, 4-(3)H]proline in the media and the cell layer.\nSMCs derived from varicose veins demonstrated increased proliferation (2-fold, P < .01), migration (3-fold, P < .001), MMP-2 production (3-fold, P < .01), and collagen synthesis (>2-fold, P < .001), with decreased expression of phenotype-dependent markers compared with SMCs derived from normal veins (P < .05).\nSMCs derived from varicose veins are more dedifferentiated and demonstrate increased proliferative and synthetic capacity than SMCs derived from normal veins. These properties may contribute to the remodeling of the venous wall and the weakening of its antipressure capacity.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the latex agglutination D-dimer assay is widely used for excluding deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but is considered less sensitive than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based D-dimer test. The purpose of the present study was to determine if a combination of different cutoff points, rather than a single cutoff point of 1.0 microg/mL, on the latex agglutination D-dimer assay and the pretest clinical probability (PTP) score would be able to reduce the use of venous duplex ultrasound (DU) scanning in patients with suspected DVT.\nThe PTP score and D-dimer testing were used to evaluate 989 consecutive patients with suspected DVT before venous DU scanning. After calculating the clinical probability scores, patients were divided into low-risk (< or =0 points), moderate-risk (1-2 points), and high-risk (> or =3 points) pretest clinical probability groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the appropriate D-dimer cutoff point for each PTP with a negative predictive value of >98% for a positive DU scan.\nThere were 886 patients enrolled. The study group included 609 inpatients (68.7%) and 277 outpatients (31.3%). The prevalence of DVT in this series was 28.9%. There were 508 patients (57.3%) classified as low-risk, 237 (26.8%) as moderate-risk, and 141 (14.9%) as high-risk PTP. DVT was identified in 29 patients (5.7%) with low-risk, 118 (49.8%) with moderate-risk, and 109 (77.3%) with high-risk PTP scores. ROC curve analysis was used to select D-dimer cutoff points of 2.6, 1.1, and 1.1 microg/mL for the low-, moderate- and high-risk PTP groups, respectively. In the low-risk PTP group, specificity increased from 48.9% to 78.2% (P < .0001) with use of the different D-dimer cutoff value. In the moderate- and high-risk PTP groups, however, the different D-dimer levels did not achieve substantial improvement. Despite this, the overall use of venous DU scanning could have been reduced by 43.0% (381 of 886) if the different D-dimer cutoff points had been used.\nCombination of a specific D-dimer level with the clinical probability score is most effective in low-risk PTP patients for excluding DVT. In moderate- and high-risk PTP patients, however, the recommended cutoff points of 1.0 microg/mL may be preferable. These results show that different D-dimer levels for patients differing in risk is feasible for excluding DVT using the latex agglutination D-dimer assay.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of percutaneous transhepatic balloon angioplasty (PTBA) of the hepatic vein in the management of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) secondary to hepatic venous outflow obstruction.\nFrom September 1996 to October 2008, 101 patients (52 males, 49 females) with BCS secondary to occlusion of the hepatic veins were prospectively treated using PTBA of the hepatic vein. Average age was 31.3 years (range, 15-57 years). Nineteen had concurrent inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction. All the patients presented with symptomatic portal hypertension. PTBA, with or without stenting, was performed after hepatovenography.\nPTBA was successfully performed in 92 of the 101 patients. Sixty-eight patients underwent PTBA of right hepatic vein, followed by stent placement in two. PTBA was performed in 11 patients with left hepatic vein occlusion and in 13 patients with dominant accessory hepatic vein occlusion. The technical success rate was 92 of 101 (91%). Hepatic venous pressure was significantly decreased after balloon angioplasty/stenting (P < .01, paired t test). Symptoms were significantly improved in the 92 patients who had successful PTBA. Three patients had acute hepatic vein thrombosis during or after PTBA. Two patients sustained intraperitoneal bleeding from the transhepatic puncture track, and one had intrahepatic hematoma. Pulmonary embolism developed in one patient during the operation. All complications were managed nonoperatively. There were no perioperative deaths. Within 1 year, 74 of the 101 patients returned for follow-up, and 51 patients had follow-up at 2 years. The primary patency rates were 84% (62 of 74), 78% (58 of 74), and 76% (39 or 51) at 6, 12, and 24 months after PTBA, respectively. The secondary patency rates were 95% (70 of 74), 92% (68 of 74), and 84% (43 of 51) at 6, 12, and 24 months.\nPTBA of the hepatic vein is a safe and effective treatment of BCS. It is currently the most physiologic procedure, and the risk of postoperative encephalopathy is minimized because portal flow is not diverted. Midterm outcomes are satisfactory. Further investigation of the long-term outcomes is needed.",

PTBA was performed in 11 patients with left hepatic vein occlusion and in 13 patients with dominant accessory hepatic vein occlusion. The technical success rate was 92 of 101 (91%). Hepatic venous pressure was significantly decreased after balloon angioplasty/stenting (P < .01, paired t test). Symptoms were significantly improved in the 92 patients who had successful PTBA. Three patients had acute hepatic vein thrombosis during or after PTBA. Two patients sustained intraperitoneal bleeding from the transhepatic puncture track, and one had intrahepatic hematoma. Pulmonary embolism developed in one patient during the operation. All complications were managed nonoperatively. There were no perioperative deaths. Within 1 year, 74 of the 101 patients returned for follow-up, and 51 patients had follow-up at 2 years. The primary patency rates were 84% (62 of 74), 78% (58 of 74), and 76% (39 or 51) at 6, 12, and 24 months after PTBA, respectively.

    "abstract": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a proatherogenic molecule that accumulates in the vascular wall and contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction early in the development of atherosclerosis. The whole plant of Solanum lyratum is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for centuries to treat cancer, tumors, and herpes. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of its antioxidant effects are still largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that Solanum lyratum Thunberg extract (SLE) could block oxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Possible mechanisms were explored.\nAntioxidative activities of SLE were assayed by measuring the scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and the inhibition of copper-mediated or cell-mediated LDL oxidation. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of adhesion molecules were evaluated in HUVECs after exposure to oxLDL and treatment with SLE. Several apoptotic signaling pathways were investigated.\nSLE scavenged DPPH and also delayed the kinetics of LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. SLE attenuated the level of oxLDL-induced ROS generation, diminished the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), and enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules (vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and the adherence of monocytic THP-1 cells to HUVECs. OxLDL increased the concentration of intracellular calcium, disturbed the balance of the Bcl-2 protein family, destabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased the amount of cytochrome c released into the cytosol, and increased the activation of caspase 3. These detrimental effects were ameliorated dose-dependently by SLE (P < .05).\nCrude extracts of Solanum lyratum protect against oxLDL-induced injury in endothelial cells by direct antioxidant action.\nAtherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by lipid-laden lesions within arterialblood vessel walls. Inhibiting the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein may be an effective way to prevent or delay theprogression of atherosclerosis. This study underscores the potential clinical benefits and application of Solanum lyratumextract in controlling oxidized low-density lipoprotein-associated vascular injury and cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "While single growth factor has limitation to induce optimal neovascularization, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous reserver of various growth factors. However, little is known about the mechanism of PRP-related neovascularization.The objective of this investigation was to characterize the angiogenic and growth factor content of PRP and to determine, in vitro, its effect on endothelial cell proliferation. Additionally, this experiment sought to determine the effectiveness of different compositions of PRP (solution versus sustained release) on perfusion and neovascularization in a murine model of hind limb ischemia.\nDifferent growth factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vivo study, we used gelatin hydrogel as a sustained release carrier for growth factors in PRP. We induced hind limb ischemia by excising right femoral artery in wild type C57BL6 mice. After surgery, mice were randomly assigned to four experimental groups; control (C), 100 muL of sustained release form of platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 100 muL of solution form of PRP (PRP-sol), 100 muL of sustained release form of PRP (PRP-sr); each formulation was administered via an intramuscular injection to the ischemic hind limb. Endpoint evaluations were blood perfusion by laser Doppler perfusion image, vascular density by anti Von Willebrand factor (vWF), and mature vessel density by anti smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibody. Green fluorescent protein (GFP+) transgenic mice were generated by transplantation of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells to wild type C57BL6 mice, and finally CD34+ cell in the ischemic site of transgenic mice was detected by staining with anti-CD34 antibody.\nIn vitro study showed that PRP containing different growth factors induces endothelial cell proliferation and capillary tube formation. In vivo study demonstrated that sustained release of PRP increased perfusion of ischemic tissue as measured by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) (57 +/- 12, 56 +/- 9, 72 +/- 7, 98 +/- 4 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively; P < .05); capillary density (151 +/- 16, 158 +/- 12, 189 +/- 39, 276 +/- 39 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively, P < .05) and mature vessel density (28 +/- 2, 31 +/- 3, 52 +/- 10, 85 +/- 13 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively, P < .05) . Sustained release PRP also increases CD34+ cells in the ischemic site of transgenic mice (6 +/- 3 vs 18 +/- 5/mm(2) for groups control and PRP-sr respectively, P < .05).\nSustained release of PRP containing potent angiogenic growth factors restores blood perfusion presumably by stimulating angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, as well as vasculogenesis in the mouse hind limb ischemia.\nPRP is a natural reserver of various growth factors that can be collected autologously and is costeffective. Thus for clinical use, no special considerations concerning antibody formation and infection risk are needed.Some clinical devices to automatically prepare PRP are available at present. PRP are consistently being used clinically inthe department of orthopedics and plastic surgery (oral, maxillary facial) for a long time. On the basis of researchevidence, some publications have reported positive results in either bone or soft tissue healing. However, some researchconcludes that there is no or little benefit from PRP. This is likely due to faster degradation of growth factors in PRP sincesome authors suggest using sustained release form of PRP to deliver optimal effect of PRP. Gelatin hydrogel is also beingused clinically as a slow, sustained release of carrier for growth factors in our center recently.",

After 2 months, the left renal artery was patent and renal function normal. At 6 months, both renal arteries were fully open on duplex imaging.

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with the Endologix Powerlink System (Endologix, Inc, Irvine, Calif) has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to open surgery in patients having an aortic neck diameter of up to 26 mm. We assessed the safety and effectiveness of AAA repair in patients with wide aortic necks (up to 32 mm in diameter) using the Powerlink XL System.\nBetween September 2005 and June 2008, a prospective, multicenter, pivotal US Food and Drug Administration trial of the Powerlink XL System for endovascular aneurysm repair was conducted at 13 centers. Using a sizing algorithm based on computed tomography scan (CT)-based measurements, a total of 78 patients (N = 60 [pivotal trial]; N = 18 [continued access]) presenting with AAA and an infrarenal aortic neck up to 32 mm in diameter received a bifurcated stent graft via anatomical fixation at the aortoiliac bifurcation and proximal sealing with a Powerlink XL infrarenal proximal extension stent graft. Postoperatively, results were assessed with contrast-enhanced CT scans and abdominal x-rays at one, six, and 12 months, with continued annual follow-up to five years.\nPredominantly male (91%), patients presented at a mean age of 73 +/- 8.6 years with mean maximum aortic neck and AAA diameters of 31 +/- 1.9 mm (range, 25 to 32 mm) and 5.7 +/- 1.0 cm (range, 4.3 to 10 cm), respectively. Challenging infrarenal aortic neck anatomy, defined as the presence of severe thrombus and/or reverse taper, was present in 85% of patients. Technical success was achieved in 98.7% of patients, with one patient requiring femoral-femoral bypass intraoperatively. Aneurysm exclusion was achieved in 100% of patients over a mean procedure time of 129 +/- 66 minutes. Patients were discharged at a mean of 2.2 days postoperatively. At the one-month CT scan, the independent core lab identified a Type II endoleak in 13 patients, distal Type I and Type II endoleak in one patient, and unknown endoleak in three patients. At 30 days, there were no deaths, conversions, ruptures, or migrations. Through one year follow-up, Type II endoleak predominated (9/10 patients with endoleak), with one proximal Type I and no Type III, IV, or unknown endoleak; no conversions, ruptures, or migrations have been observed. The one-year all-cause mortality rate was 6.4%, with 100% freedom from aneurysm-related mortality. Secondary procedures were performed within one year in five patients (6.4%) for treatment of proximal Type I endoleak (n = 2), proximal Type I/Type II endoleak (n = 1), and distal Type I endoleak (n = 2). Reduced or stable aneurysm sac diameter at one year is observed in 96% of patients.\nThe combination of an anatomically-fixed Powerlink bifurcated stent graft and a Powerlink XL infrarenal proximal extension appears safe and effectively excludes aneurysms in patients with wide aortic necks. These results suggest that fixation at the aortic bifurcation can provide secure fixation for patients with large diameter diseased proximal aortic necks.",

    "abstract": "As in arteries, venous endothelium modulates vessel homeostasis and tone. The effect of an arterialized environment on venous endothelial function remains poorly understood. In particular, regulation of saphenous vein graft (SVG) blood flow and lumen caliber remains undefined. We hypothesized that mature SVGs would exhibit endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). We further hypothesized that endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) was an important mediator.\nPatients with femoral to popliteal artery SVGs that had maintained primary patency and were at least 1 year from surgery were enrolled. High-resolution, B-mode ultrasound scans were used to measure vein graft diameter before and 1 minute after reactive hyperemia (RH) to determine FMD. RH was created through application of 220 mm Hg to the calf for 5 minutes with a sphygmomanometric cuff. After a 10-minute recovery period, nitroglycerin-mediated, endothelium-independent vasodilation was measured 3 minutes after administration of nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually. Brachial artery FMD was determined by validated techniques. L-N(G)monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA; 1 mg/kg infusion over 10 minutes) was used in a subset of patients (n = 6) to competitively inhibit endothelial NO synthase.\nNineteen subjects were enrolled. The median age of the SVGs was 34.6 (21.0-49.7) months.

    "abstract": "Atherothrombosis, characterized by atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent occlusive or subocclusive thrombus formation is the primary cause of acute ischemic syndromes involving all vascular beds and accounts for more than one-third of all deaths in the developed world. Platelet activation and aggregation constitute the most critical component in the pathophysiology of atherothrombotic disease. Aspirin is currently the most commonly used antiplatelet agent and one of the most frequently prescribed drugs, with as many as 30 million Americans on chronic aspirin regimens. Multiple well-designed prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated aspirin's efficacy in both primary and secondary prevention of a wide variety of entities that the atherothrombotic disease spectrum encompasses, such as cerebrovascular, coronary artery, and peripheral vascular disease. Despite its proven benefit, however, a growing body of evidence suggests that up to 70% of aspirin-takers may still be at risk for atherothrombotic complications due to resistance. Patients with laboratory-confirmed aspirin resistance seem to have an almost fourfold increase in their risk for acute thrombotic episodes, which underlines the magnitude of the problem for the vascular specialist. In this article, we review the physiology of platelet activation and the role of aspirin as an antiplatelet agent; the various laboratory assays used in assessing aspirin effectiveness; and current data on aspirin resistance and its clinical implications in patients with cardiovascular disease. We also review the studies that explore this phenomenon in patients with peripheral arterial disease and discuss the optimal management options in aspirin-resistant individuals. Suggestions are advanced for the direction of future trials evaluating aspirin resistance in patients with vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "There are still some vascular surgeons who do not use carotid patching routinely in all patients undergoing CEA, however, based on the data presented in this review, there is Level 1 evidence to support the routine use of carotid patching. Meanwhile, there is no Level 1 evidence to support selective patching for CEA, however a Grade D recommendation may be used to recommend that primary closure can be safely practiced in a large ICA (>6mm). A meta-analysis/systemic review of well-conducted prospective randomized trials (Level 1 evidence) concluded that there was no difference in stroke/death rates between conventional CEA with patch closure and eversion CEA. The incidence of significant restenosis with eversion CEA is also similar to CEA with patch closure, however eversion CEA had a lower restenosis rate than patients undergoing CEA with primary closure. Prior to the GALA trial, there was insufficient evidence from randomized clinical trials comparing CEA under local anesthesia versus general anesthesia to support the superiority of either technique in reducing major perioperative events, i.e. stroke, MI, or death. However, the GALA trial concluded that the perioperative stroke/MI and death rates were equivalent in both techniques.",

    "abstract": "The geometry and dynamics of the vena cava are poorly understood and current knowledge is largely based on qualitative data. The purpose of this study is to quantitate the dimensional changes that occur in the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC), in response to changes in intravascular volume.\nIVC dimensions were measured at 1 cm and 5 cm below the renal veins, on serial contrasted computed tomographic (CT) scans, in 30 severely injured trauma patients during hypovolemic (admission) and fluid resuscitated (follow-up) states. Changes in volume of the infrarenal segment were calculated and correlated with changes in IVC diameter and orientation. The orientation of the infrarenal caval segment was quantified as the angulation of the major axis from the horizontal. A representation of the IVC diameter, as would be seen on standard anterior-posterior venographic imaging, was determined by projecting the CT image of the major axis onto a coronal plane. CT representations of venographic diameters were compared with measurements of the true major axis to assess accuracy of venograms for caval sizing and filter selection.\nAll patients had evidence of a collapsed IVC (<15 mm minor axis dimension) on admission. Mean time between admission and follow-up CT was 49.5 (range: 1-202) days. The volume of the infrarenal segment increased more than twofold with resuscitation, increasing from 6.9 +/- 2.2 (range: 3.1-12.4) mL on admission, to 15.7 +/- 5.0 (range: 9.2-28.5) mL on follow-up (P < .01). At both 1 and 5 cm below the renal veins, the IVC expanded anisotropically such that the minor axis expanded up to five times its initial size accommodating 84% of the increased volume of the segment, while only small diameter changes were observed in the major axis accounting for less than 5% of the volume increase (P < .001). Further, the IVC was left-anterior-oblique in all patients, with the major axis 26 degrees off the horizontal on average. This orientation did not change significantly with volume resuscitation (P > 0.5). The obliquity of the IVC resulted in significant underestimation of caval size of up to 6.8 mm, when using the venographic representation for sizing instead of the true major axis (P < 0.001).\nIn response to changes in intravascular volume, the IVC undergoes profound anisotropic dimensional changes, with greater displacement seen in the minor axis. In addition, the IVC is oriented left-anterior oblique and caval orientation is not altered by changes in volume status. IVC obliquity may result in underestimation of caval size by anterior-posterior venogram.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and outcome of endovascular therapy combined with immunosuppressive therapy for aortic pseudoaneurysms in patients with Beh\u00e7et disease.\nBetween April 2002 and April 2008, 12 pseudoaneurysms (9 involving the intrarenal abdominal aorta, 1 at the suprarenal level, and 2 in the supraceliac aorta) in nine men and one woman with Beh\u00e7et disease were evaluated at Peking Union Medical Center (PUMC). Three bifurcated stent grafts and seven tubular stent grafts, including two fenestrated stent grafts, were deployed. All 10 patients received immunosuppressive therapy after the implant procedure.\nAll patients underwent successful endovascular therapy without major complications during the 30 days immediately after the procedure. One patient with two aneurysms had treatment of only the larger infrarenal symptomatic aneurysm, but the smaller suprarenal pseudoaneurysm was not addressed because of its proximity to mesenteric branches. During a mean follow-up of 25.8 months (range, 6-50 months), nine aneurysms resolved completely in eight patients. The only untreated aneurysm, which coexisted with a treated lesion, remained stable under imaging observation. Three aneurysms recurred in two patients. At 6 months, one patient presented with a new aneurysm at the femoral artery access site for stent graft introduction and another formed at the proximal margin of the stent graft. Despite medical advice, he had stopped immunotherapy. He died from aneurysm rupture 8 months after stent deployment. Another patient with recurrent aneurysmal disease at the distal margin of the primary stent was successfully treated with an additional stent graft. These two were the only patients who did not adhere to taking immunosuppressant medicine after discharge.\nEndovascular stent graft placement combined with immunosuppressive treatment for aortic pseudoaneurysms in Beh\u00e7et disease is a feasible and effective management option. Long-term immunosuppressive therapy after endovascular repair is important to limit pseudoaneurysm recurrence.",

    "results": "All patients underwent successful endovascular therapy without major complications during the 30 days immediately after the procedure. One patient with two aneurysms had treatment of only the larger infrarenal symptomatic aneurysm, but the smaller suprarenal pseudoaneurysm was not addressed because of its proximity to mesenteric branches. During a mean follow-up of 25.8 months (range, 6-50 months), nine aneurysms resolved completely in eight patients. The only untreated aneurysm, which coexisted with a treated lesion, remained stable under imaging observation. Three aneurysms recurred in two patients. At 6 months, one patient presented with a new aneurysm at the femoral artery access site for stent graft introduction and another formed at the proximal margin of the stent graft. Despite medical advice, he had stopped immunotherapy. He died from aneurysm rupture 8 months after stent deployment. Another patient with recurrent aneurysmal disease at the distal margin of the primary stent was successfully treated with an additional stent graft. These two were the only patients who did not adhere to taking immunosuppressant medicine after discharge.",

    "abstract": "Silver-coated vascular polyester prostheses were developed not only for the treatment of prosthetic graft infections, but also for use as prophylaxes. Although some studies describe the use of these prostheses in cases of infection, there are few data on their prophylactic use. This study compares the performance of the InterGard Silver polyester graft (Intervascular, Datascope, Inc, La Ciotat, France) with that of standard prostheses in routine use.\nThis retrospective study included all patients who received alloplastic bypass for treatment of arterial occlusive disease at the University Hospital in W\u00fcrzburg from January 1996 to December 2006. The courses of disease were analyzed by examining the medical records. Follow-up research documented long-term results.\nThe cases of 913 patients were analyzed (430 silver grafts, 483 standard grafts). Indications for the operations were claudication (silver: 136, nonsilver: 212), rest pain (49/65), tissue loss (135/148), and acute occlusion (110/58). Prosthetic implantation was performed in the aorto-iliaco-femoral position (silver: 93, nonsilver: 146), in the femorodistal position (309/304), and as multilevel reconstruction (28/33). With regard to perioperative complications, the two groups did not differ significantly. There were no silver release-related complications, such as colored exudation or wound staining. Mean follow-up time was 56.7 +/- 1.6 (SEM) months. When corrected for redo procedures, stage of disease, and type of reconstruction, both materials performed equally well: 5-year patency for claudication: silver 91%, nonsilver 95%, femorodistal 47%/41%; 5-year patency for critical ischemia: aortofemoral 88%/93%, femorodistal 31%/35%; 5-year limb salvage (critical ischemia): aortofemoral: 78%/79%; femorodistal: 59%/67%. Graft infections (Szilagyi grade III) were detected in 59 patients (6.4%; silver: n = 32, 7.4% vs control: n = 27, 5.5%; P = .28) after an average of 321 +/- 96 days. One infection occurred out of 93 aortofemoral operations with the silver prosthesis (1.1%) compared to 4.1% (6/146) in the control group (P = .17). For patients with femorodistal grafts, silver exhibited an infection rate of 9.4% compared to 5.9% (P = .11). In the multiple regression analysis, two factors influenced the rate of a graft infection significantly: wound healing impairment and revision after bypass implantation. Silver did not prevent a subsequent bypass infection in these cases (silver: 18.1% vs 12.5%, P = .27).\nThe silver-coated prosthesis did not differ from standard materials. Silver had no significant effect on the risk of graft infection. Our study showed good results with the silver prosthesis in the aorto-iliaco-femoral position, but in cases of femorodistal grafting, a reduction of prosthetic infections was not achieved. The silver grafts did not prevent subsequent infections in cases of tissue loss or postoperative local complications.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective matched case-control study evaluated the consequences of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR Pa) in critical leg ischemia (CLI) patients treated with infrainguinal bypass surgery (IBS).\nAn outbreak of MDR Pa occurred on our vascular surgical ward during a 13-month period. Bacteria cultures positive for MDR Pa were obtained from 129 patients, and 64 CLI patients treated with IBS formed the study group. A control group of 64 was retrospectively matched from MDR Pa-negative patients treated with IBS in the same unit according to sex, age, presence of diabetes, Fontaine class, graft material, and site of the distal anastomosis. The most frequent sites of initial positive MDR Pa culture were the incisional wound in 30 (47%) and ischemic ulcer in 23 (36%). Median time between the positive MDR Pa-culture and IBS was 14 days (range, 56 days pre-IBS to 246 days post-IBS). Graft patency, survival, leg salvage, and amputation-free survival were assessed.\nOne-year amputation-free survival (+/- standard error) was 52% +/- 6% in the MDR Pa group vs 75% +/- 5% in the control group (P = .02). Five-year amputation-free survival was 29% +/- 6% in the MDR Pa group and 32% +/- 6% in the control group (P = .144). For MDR Pa and control groups, the 1-year survival was 69% +/- 6% and 82% +/- 5% (P = .063), respectively, and 5-year survival was 36% +/- 6% and 36% +/- 6% (P = .302), respectively. For the MDR Pa and control groups, leg salvage was 79% +/- 5% and 92% +/- 4% at 1 year (P = .078) and 73% +/- 7% and 87% +/- 5% at 5 years (P = .126), respectively. The overall secondary patency rate at 1 year was 72% +/- 7% in the MDR Pa group vs 81% +/- 6% in the control group (P = .149). Local wound surgery was more frequent in MDR Pa patients than in controls (P = .002).\nThe MDR Pa outbreak was associated with a decreased short-term amputation-free survival after IBS for CLI in patients with positive MDR Pa culture. The potential risks of MDR Pa should be seriously considered whenever a positive culture is obtained in a vascular patient with CLI.",

    "abstract": "Early in our experience with endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) we performed both serial computed tomography scans and duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging in our post-EVAR surveillance regimen. Later we conducted a prospective study with DU imaging as the sole surveillance study and determined cost savings and outcome using this strategy.\nFrom September 21, 1998, to May 30, 2008, 250 patients underwent EVAR at our hospital. Before July 1, 2004, EVAR patients underwent CT and DU imaging performed every 6 months during the first year and then annually if no problems were identified (group 1). We compared aneurysm sac size, presence of endoleak, and graft patency between the two scanning modalities. After July 1, 2004, patients underwent surveillance using DU imaging as the sole surveillance study unless a problem was detected (group 2). CT and DU imaging charges for each regimen were compared using our 2008 health system pricing and Medicare reimbursements. All DU examinations were performed in our accredited noninvasive vascular laboratory by experienced technologists. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation coefficient.\nDU and CT scans were equivalent in determining aneurysm sac diameter after EVAR (P < .001). DU and CT were each as likely to falsely suggest an endoleak when none existed and were as likely to miss an endoleak. Using DU imaging alone would have reduced cost of EVAR surveillance by 29% ($534,356) in group 1. Cost savings of $1595 per patient per year were realized in group 2 by eliminating CT scan surveillance. None of the group 2 patients sustained an adverse event such as rupture, graft migration, or limb occlusion as a result of having DU imaging performed as the sole follow-up modality.\nSurveillance of EVAR patients can be performed accurately, safely, and cost-effectively with DU as the sole imaging study.",

    "abstract": "Medicare is a massive and essential safety healthcare net for the elderly in the United States. It covers 45 million people in 2009 (almost one-sixth of the population) and projected to cover an increasing number of aged beneficiaries with a decreasing number of workers paying into the system. Medicare spending is about 13% of the federal budget and 3.2% of gross domestic product. A 7.4% annual growth rate in spending is expected to lead to potential insolvency by 2019. Spending on physician services and other suppliers is about 20% of Medicare outlays. Payment updates for physician services are insufficient in relation to the cost of providing services. The most serious issue remains a permanent fix for the sustained growth rate formula used for calculating payment updates for physicians. Further procrastination of difficult but essential decisions on funding has dire implications for Vascular Surgery and the patients we serve.",

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) are associated with high rupture rates and poor outcome in patients who do not have surgical repair. Endovascular and hybrid techniques have gained increasing acceptance for the treatment of TAAA in patients with multiple comorbidities and an increased anesthetic risk. One of the complications of endovascular repair in TAAA is procedurally related embolism to visceral vessels. Visceral embolism causes bowel ischemia and is a potentially lethal complication. This report illustrates the intermittent use of catheters with balloon-inflatable tips as visceral embolus protection systems. These catheters are easy to apply and demonstrated perfect prevention of visceral embolization. To date, 10 patients have undergone operations at our clinic using this protection system, and no embolic complications were observed at the visceral vessels. Therefore, catheters with balloon-inflatable tips for visceral embolous protection should be considered in patients undergoing a two-stage hybrid TAAA repair to avoid embolus-associated morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries around the world. In the United States, there are an estimated 700,000 cases of stroke annually (of which over 85% are ischemic), costing an estimated $56.8 billion in associated treatment. Large vessel internal carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of ischemic stroke. Population-based studies have shown that the prevalence of carotid stenosis is approximately 0.5% in the sixth decade of life and increases to approximately 10% in the ninth decade. The majority of patients are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic carotid stenosis with <or=75% lumen loss carries a stroke risk of 1.3% annually, whereas the combined risk of myocardial ischemia and vascular death is as high as 10%. With diameter stenosis >75%, the combined stroke and transient ischemic attack risk increases to approximately 11% annually, with 75% of events ipsilateral to the affected artery. Other studies have also shown that the risk of stroke increases proportionately to the severity of stenosis. The risk is higher for those patients who are symptomatic. In this review, we will discuss antiplatelet agents to prevent cerebrovascular events in the context of extracranial carotid artery disease. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss antiplatelet treatment for other etiologies of stroke.",

    "abstract": "We report the clinical feasibility of fluoroscopic Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (FRSA), a validated method to quantify real time three-dimensional (3D) dynamic motion of stent grafts and the first clinical results after abdominal and thoracic endovascular repair (EVAR). Stent graft motion was measured at 30 (stereo) frames per second, during the cardiac cycle and in the patient after abdominal EVAR, due to respiratory action. Translational motions of the center of mass, diameter change, and rotational and axial motion could be measured. Quantification of 3D motion was not available until now. FRSA can provide crucial information on the forces exerted on stent grafts and will, therefore, provide essential information for improvements in stent graft design.",

    "abstract": "Cold storage of arteries for reconstructive and bypass surgery may result in injury of endothelial cells which may promote low perfusion and graft vasculopathy.\nA recently developed N-acetyl histidine-buffered, potassium-chloride enriched, and amino acid-fortified vascular storage solution augmented with iron chelators deferoxamine (100 micromol/L) and LK 614 (20 micromol/L) was studied in the rat superior mesenteric artery and aorta with respect to: (1) potassium-induced vessel tone, (2) endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation, and (3) endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression over 4-days cold storage (4 degrees C).This solution was compared with traditional storage solutions, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) and physiological saline solution (PSS).\nVessels stored for 4 days in the new solution were significantly better protected than those stored in traditional HTK or PSS. The protective effects comprised: (1) vessel tone development after stimulation with potassium-chloride solution, (2) endothelium-dependent and -independent vessel relaxation, and (3) eNOS expression. With iron chelators (deferoxamine 100 microM, LK 614 20 microM) present in the storage solution, endothelium-dependent relaxations (eNOS-dependent and K(Ca)-channel-dependent) were fully maintained after 96 hours of cold storage. Endothelial cell structure was significantly better maintained after 96 hours in the new solution than in HTK or PSS solutions. Already, 2 hours of cold storage in HTK resulted in a significant loss of structurally intact endothelium. The structural changes correlated significantly with the diminished vessel relaxation capacity.

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury is considered to be related to a vulnerability of spinal motor neurons to ischemia. However, the mechanisms underlying this vulnerability are not fully understood. We investigated the role of autophagy, which is an intracellular bulk degradation process, at motor neuron as a potential mechanism of neuronal death by immunohistochemical analysis for microtubule-associated protein light chain3 (LC3) and gamma-aminobutyric-acid type-A-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) which are considered as markers of autophagy.\nWe used a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model with the use of a balloon catheter. The spinal cord was removed at 8 hours, 1, 2, or 7 days after 15 minutes of transient ischemia, and histologic changes were examined with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Western blot analysis for LC3 and GABARAP, temporal profiles of LC3 and GABARAP immunoreactivity, and double-label fluorescence immunocytochemical studies were performed.\nIn the ischemia group, about 85% of motor neurons were preserved until 2 days after reperfusion, but were selectively lost at 7 days (P < .001 compared with sham group). Western blot analysis demonstrated slight immunoreactivity for LC3 and GABARAP in the sham-operated spinal cords. In contrast, the ischemia group LC3 and GABARAP immunoreactivity became apparent at 8 hours after reperfusion. With quantitative analysis we found that ischemia affected expression profiles of LC3-II and GABARAP. At 8 hours after reperfusion, co-labeling of LC3 and GABARAP were observed in the same motor neurons that eventually died.\nThese data suggest that autophagy was induced in motor neurons by transient spinal cord ischemia in rabbits.",

    "abstract": "Although technological improvements continue to advance the designs of aortic stent grafts, miniaturization of the required delivery systems would allow their application to be available to a wider range of patients and potentially decrease the access difficulties that are encountered. We performed this feasibility study to determine if thin-film NiTi (Nitinol) could be used as a covering for stent grafts ranging from 16 mm to 40 mm in diameter. Specifically, we wished to determine the profile reduction attainable and improve the flexibility of our design.\nUsing a novel hot-sputter deposition technique, we created sheets of thin-film NiTi (TFN) with a tensile strength of >500 Megapascal (MPa) and thickness of 5-10 microns. TFN was used to cover stents, which were then deployed in vitro. Patterned thin film was fabricated via a lift-off technique; grafts were constructed with stents ranging from 16-40 mm and deployed in a pulsatile flow system from the smallest diameter polymer tubing into which the stent and TFN would fit. The bending/stiffness ratio vs similar sized expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stents was also determined.\nTFN was created in both non-patterned and patterned forms, with a tensile strength of >100 MPa for the latter. We created devices that were successfully deployed via delivery systems half the size of fabric-covered stent grafts (ie, the 16 mm stent graft that originally was delivered via a 16French (F) system was reduced to 8F, and the 40 mm stent graft delivered via a 24F system was reduced to 12F). No migration of the devices was observed with deployment in both straight and curved tubing, which was sized so that the stent grafts were oversized by 20%. Both forms of the thin-film were noted to be more flexible than the same sized ePTFE stent graft, and the patterned graft had an additional 15-30% flexibility vs the non-patterned film.\nThese in vitro results demonstrate the feasibility of TFN for covering stent grafts designed for placement in the aorta. The delivery profile can be significantly reduced across a wide range of sizes, while the material remained more flexible than ePTFE.",

    "abstract": "The depth of veins can discourage surgeons from creating radial-cephalic arteriovenous accesses for hemodialysis in obese patients. Elevation and tunneled transposition are the two techniques that have been described to superficialize these veins and make them accessible for cannulation. Unfortunately, such manipulation of veins has potential drawbacks. We report lipectomy, a new technique that removes subcutaneous fat and does not mobilize the vein.\nThis single-center prospective study included 49 consecutive patients (17 men, 32 women) who underwent second-stage lipectomy after creation of a radial-cephalic fistula. Mean patient age was 54 years, 36% had diabetes, and the mean body mass index was 31 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2). Subcutaneous fatty tissues were removed after two transverse skin incisions under regional anesthesia and preventive hemostasis. Cannulation was first allowed 1 month later, after clinical and color duplex ultrasound evaluation. Technical success was defined as the ability to remove the fat and to palpate the patent vein immediately under the skin at the end of the operation. Clinical success was defined as the ability to perform at least three consecutive dialysis sessions with two needles. All patients were checked systematically every 6 months by the surgeon.\nTechnical and clinical success rates were 96% (47 of 49) and 94% (46 of 49), respectively. Mean vein depth decreased from 8 +/- 2 to 3 +/- 1 mm according to duplex ultrasound imaging. The mean vein diameter increased from 6 +/- 1 to 8 +/- 2 mm. In one patient, vein tortuosity that was overlooked required conventional repeat tunneling. One extensive hematoma resulted in loss of the fistula. One patient died before the fistula could be used. Primary patency rates were 71% +/- 7% and 63% +/- 8% at 1 and 3 years, respectively, and secondary patency rates were 98% +/- 2% and 88% +/- 7%. Delayed complications were treated by surgery (n = 7) or by endovascular procedures (n = 10).\nLipectomy is a safe, effective, and durable approach to make deep arterialized forearm veins accessible for routine cannulation for hemodialysis in obese patients. It might even be hypothesized that incident obese dialysis patients will eventually have the highest proportion of radial-cephalic fistulas because they often have distal veins that have been preserved by their fat from previous attempts at cannulation for blood sampling or infusion.",

We herein report our experience of pregnancy in women who have a history of ilio-caval stenting.\nFrom November 1995 to April 2008, 119 patients had ilio-caval stenting for obstructive venous disease in our department. Of these, 62 women were able to become pregnant. When pregnancy occurred, they received preventive treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) from the 3rd month of pregnancy to 1 month after delivery and had to wear elastic stockings. Patients also had to sleep on their right side if possible. They were followed during the pregnancy by duplex scanning at 3, 6, and 8 months, and then 1 month after delivery.\nEight pregnancies occurred in 6 patients (mean age 26.5 years) who had a patent self-expanding stent (1 patient had 3 pregnancies). They had stenting for May-Thurner disease in 3 patients, for post-deep venous thrombosis (DVT) left common iliac vein occlusion in 1 patient, and during venous thrombectomy in 2 patients. All stents were self-expanding metallic stents located on the left common iliac vein. One patient had unrelated spontaneous abortion after 2 months of pregnancy. No DVT or symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred during pregnancy, delivery, or during the postpartum period. Four patients needed cesarean delivery and none had hemorrhagic complications. None of the patients had adverse effects from the treatment. Duplex scan showed compression of the stent(s) at 8 months in 4 patients with inflow obstruction in 3 patients. Postpartum duplex-scan showed no remaining stenosis in all patients. No stents had structural damage.\nIlio-caval stent compression can occur during pregnancy but does not lead to structural damage to the self-expanding stents. Despite this, no cases of DVT occurred with preventive LMWH treatment.",

    "abstract": "Gender and ethnicity are factors affecting the incidence and severity of vascular disease as well as subsequent treatment outcomes. Although well studied in other fields, balanced enrollment of patients with relevant demographic characteristics in vascular surgery randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is not well known. This study describes the reporting of gender and ethnicity data in vascular surgery RCTs and analyzes whether these studies adequately represent our diverse patient population.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of United States-based RCTs from 1983 through 2007 for three broadly defined vascular procedures: aortic aneurysm repair (AAR), carotid revascularization (CR), and lower extremity revascularization (LER). Included studies were examined for gender and ethnicity data, study parameters, funding source, and geographic region. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was analyzed to obtain group-specific procedure frequency as an estimate of procedure frequency in the general population.\nWe reviewed 77 studies, and 52 met our inclusion criteria. Only 85% reported gender, and 21% reported ethnicity. Reporting of ethnicity was strongly associated with larger (>280 participants), multicenter, government-funded trials (P < .001 for all). Women are disproportionately under-represented in RCTs for all procedure categories (AAR, 9.0% vs 21.5%; CR, 30.0% vs 42.9%; LER, 22.4% vs 41.3%). Minorities are under-represented in AAR studies (6.0% vs 10.7%) and CR studies (6.9% vs 9.5%) but are over-represented in LER studies (26.0% vs 21.8%, P < .001 for all).\nMinority ethnicity and female gender are under-reported and under-represented in vascular surgery RCTs, particularly in small, non-government-funded and single-center trials. The generalizability of some trial results may not be applicable to these populations. Greater effort to enroll a balanced study population in RCTs may yield more broadly applicable results.",

    "abstract": "A meta-regression analysis was conducted to identify the most reliable treadmill protocol for the assessment of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nTreadmill testing is the main assessment method to evaluate walking ability in patients with PAD in clinical studies. Reported treadmill protocols are continuous (C) and graded (G) protocols and outcome measurements are initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD). Variety in protocols might hamper the ability to compare results of different studies. Ideally, future studies should use a protocol with highest reliability.\nWe searched PubMed and EMBASE (until February 2008) and we hand searched the reference lists. Trials assessing reliability of treadmill testing were identified. Inclusion criteria were the use of a C- or G-protocol, repetition of this protocol, and a retrievable intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We identified eight studies in which 658 patients were included.\nFor ICD, the estimated reliabilities of the C- and G-protocol (as assessed by the ICC) were 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-0.88) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80-0.85), respectively, without dependency of the reliability on velocity or grade. For ACD, the reliability was significantly better for the G-protocol (0.95, 95% CI: 0.94-0.96) than for the C-protocol. Moreover, the reliability of the C-protocol was dependent on grade of the treadmill (0%, 10%, and 12%) with a mean ICC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.54-0.88), 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.92), respectively.\nTreadmill assessment has the highest reliability when using a G-protocol together with the ACD as the primary outcome measure.",

This study assessed the association of preprocedural hemoglobin with adverse outcome in patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease (PVD) undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).\nConsecutive first-time procedures for patients with Rutherford category 4 or 5 PVD who underwent successful nonemergency PTA were analyzed in a retrospective cohort study. Cardiovascular risk factors, preprocedural hemoglobin, and angiographic data were recorded. Preprocedural (<or=24 hours) hemoglobin was divided into tertiles (first tertile: 10.5 +/- 0.7 g/dL; second tertile: 12.0 +/- 0.4 g/dL; third tertile: 13.9 +/- 0.9 g/dL). Study end points were a composite of adverse peripheral vascular events consisting of target lesion revascularization (repeat PTA or vascular bypass operation), limb amputation, or death. Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of adverse peripheral vascular outcome.\nA total of 101 patients (mean age, 76 +/- 10 years) were studied, of which 54 (53%) were men, and 62 (65%) were anemic. We observed 42 events during a median of 14 months (interquartile range, 4-26 months follow-up). Cox regression analysis found preprocedural hemoglobin in the first tertile vs third tertile (odds ratio, 4.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-11.16, P = .004), diabetes, renal failure, Rutherford category 5, and tibial vessels runoff score were independent predictors of adverse peripheral vascular outcome.\nAnemia is a common comorbid condition in patients with advanced PVD. Preprocedural hemoglobin could be used in clinical practice to risk stratify patients with advanced PVD who are being considered for PTA. Correction of anemia before PTA in patients with Rutherford category 4 and 5 PVD may improve long-term outcome. Further investigation is needed regarding the optimization of preprocedural hemoglobin.",

Patients >or=80 (89 patients, 101 limbs) and <80 years old (255 patients, 298 limbs) were compared for demographics, characteristics, patency, limb salvage, sustained clinical success (preservation of limb, freedom from target extremity revascularization (TER), and resolution of symptoms), secondary clinical success (preservation of limb and resolution of symptoms), overall improvement (preservation of limb, improvement of symptoms), and survival.\nPatients >or=80 were more likely to be nonambulatory and have coronary artery disease, whereas those <80 were more likely to have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dialysis-dependence, active tobacco abuse, and taking beta-blockers. Primary amputation rates were similar between two groups (<80 vs >or=80, 6.7% vs 8.1%, P = .530).

The patency rates were similar between groups, however, LS was significantly better in >or=80 EV-treated patients than <80 group, whereas it was similar between groups in open-treated patients. Sustained clinical success, secondary clinical success, and overall improvement rates were similar between age groups. Endovascular-treated patients in >or=80 had significantly better overall improvement than those who were treated by open revascularization (24-month overall improvement 83% +/- 5% vs 61% +/- 9%, P = .043).

The decision, in part, is dependant on periprocedural morbidity. The goal of this study was to document the contemporary morbidity and mortality of infrainguinal BPG, utilizing the previously validated National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database.\nData from the private sector NSQIP, a prospectively validated systematic-sample database, using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for all infrainguinal BPG performed between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2006, were analyzed. Study endpoints included 30-day death and NSQIP-defined major complications, including graft failure, differentiated between systemic vs operative-site related complications. Potentially associated clinical variables were assessed by univariate methods to create the multivariate models of factors associated with study endpoints.\nThere were 2404 infrainguinal BPG (infrapopliteal distal anastomosis 42%, prosthetic 29%) performed in the study interval with patient variables: age 67 +/- 12, male 66%, diabetes 44%, limb salvage indications 48%. The 30-day composite mortality/major morbidity was 19.5%. The overall mortality was 2.7% and correlated with (P value, odds ratio [OR]): patient age (<.001, 1.056), low body weight (.007, 0.988), significant preoperative dyspnea (.03, 1.97), dialysis (.003, 5.26), history transient ischemic attack (.03, 2.43), and bleeding disorder (.02, 2.01). Major complications occurred in 18.7% patients, including 7.4% graft thromboses, and 9.4% wound infections.

    "abstract": "To study the risk factors and rate of progression of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\nBetween July 1999 and September 2003, we studied consecutive patients referred to a vascular laboratory for peripheral arterial occlusive disease who had not experienced neurologic symptoms within the previous 3 years. Carotid duplex ultrasound scan (DUS) was performed at baseline and at 6 to 12-month intervals. The internal carotid artery peak systolic velocity (PSV) was used to determine severity of carotid stenosis. Multilevel linear regression modeling (MLM) was used to identify the rate of progression and risk factors for progression.\nFor 614 consecutive patients, median follow-up by DUS was 30 (2-42) months. Patients were 73 +/- 10-years-old, and 62% were men. Mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.79 +/- 0.24. The baseline prevalence of carotid stenosis >or=50% (PSV >or=125 cm/second) was 22%. During follow-up, ipsilateral amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attacks, and strokes occurred in 3 (0.4%), 7 (1.1%), and 5 (0.8%) patients, respectively. Overall, there was little progression in carotid stenosis. Female gender, low ABI, and smoking were risk factors for progression of disease regardless of severity of carotid stenosis. Patients with >or=50% carotid stenosis were at greatest risk of progression if they continued smoking and were diabetic. Prediction models for progression of carotid stenosis given a baseline PSV and patient risk factors were constructed.\nThere are few neurologic events in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The average rate of progression of stenosis over 2 years is not significant but greater in diabetic patients with baseline stenosis >50% who continue smoking. Rescreening by serial DUS should be limited to high-grade stenosis and follow-up performed at an interval of 1-2 years.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound velocity criteria have been used to evaluate the severity of carotid stenosis, however, these standard velocities may not be applicable to carotid restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with patch angioplasty. The purpose of this study is to determine if patch angioplasty closure alters velocities just distal to CEA and to define the optimal velocities for detecting >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=70% restenosis.\nThis study includes 200 CEAs randomized into 100 with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) ACUSEAL patch and 100 with Hemashield Finesse patch. All patients underwent immediate postoperative duplex ultrasounds, which were repeated at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. Patients with a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the internal carotid artery ([ICA], just distal to the patch) of >or=130 c/s underwent computed tomography angiogram (CTA). PSVs, end diastolic velocities (EDV), and internal carotid artery/common carotid artery (ICA/CCA) ratios were correlated to completion arteriograms/CTAs. Receiver operator characteristic curves analyses were used to determine optimal velocity criteria in detecting >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=70% restenosis.\nOne hundred ninety-five pairs of imagings (duplex ultrasound vs CTA/angiogram) were available for analysis. When standard velocity criteria for nonoperated arteries were applied, 37% and 10% of patients were believed to have >or=50% to <70% and >or=70% to 99% restenosis vs 11.3% and 11.3% on CTA/angiography, respectively (P < .001). The mean PSV for >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=70% restenosis were 172, 249, and 389 c/s, respectively (P < .001). An ICA PSV of >or=155c/s was optimal for >or=30% restenosis with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy (OA) of 98%, 98%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. A PSV of >or=213 c/s was optimal for >or=50% restenosis with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA of 99%, 100%, 100%, 98%, and 99%, respectively. An ICA PSV of 274 c/s was optimal for >or=70% restenosis with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA of 99%, 91%, 99%, 91%, and 98%, respectively. ROC analysis showed that the PSVs were significantly better than EDVs and ICA/CCA ratios in detecting >or=30% and >or=50% restenosis.\nThe mean PSVs of a normal ICA distal to CEA patching were higher than normal nonoperated ICAs, therefore, standard duplex velocities criteria should be revised after CEA with patch closure.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report a series of 16 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic treatment of splenic artery aneurysms.\nOver a period of 8 years, patients were selected for the laparoscopic option by a team of specialists that included the vascular surgeon, the interventional radiologist, and the laparoscopic surgeon. The mean size of the aneurysm was 32 mm and most was located at the splenic hilum. They were twice as common in females as in males. Ultrasonography with color Doppler function was used to define intraoperative strategy.\nThe laparoscopic treatment entailed excision of the aneurysm or its exclusion, usually reserved for distally located lesions. In one patient, laparoscopic resection and robotic anastomosis of the splenic artery was performed to re-establish flow to the spleen. In two patients, the intraoperative decision was added to combine a laparoscopic splenectomy due to insufficient residual arterial flow to the spleen. There was no conversion, or need for re-operation or related mortality. Analysis of intraoperative arterial flow data avoided unnecessary splenectomy following noncritical reduction of flow to the spleen.\nThe use of intraoperative color Doppler ultrasonography is essential in deciding the appropriate procedure and whether the spleen should be removed or saved. Early control of the splenic artery proximal to the aneurysm can limit the risk of conversion due to intraoperative bleeding. Distally located aneurysms are more difficult to manage and entail a higher risk of associated splenectomy. The laparoscopic option offers some advantages over the endovascular treatment in selected patients. A multidisciplinary approach is the key to a successful treatment of this uncommon disease.",

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysm size is a critical determinant of the need for intervention, yet the maximal diameter will often vary depending on the modality and method of measurement. We aimed to define the relationship between commonly used computed tomography (CT) measurement techniques and those based on current reporting standards and to compare the values obtained with diameter measured using ultrasound (US).\nCT scans from patients with US-detected aneurysms were analyzed using three-dimensional reconstruction software. Maximal aortic diameter was recorded in the anteroposterior (CT-AP) plane, along the maximal ellipse (CT-ME), perpendicular to the maximal ellipse (CT-PME), or perpendicular to the centerline of flow (CT-PCLF). Diameter measurements were compared with each other and with maximal AP diameter according to US (US-AP). Analysis was performed according to the principles of Bland and Altman. Results are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation.\nCT and US scans from 109 patients (92 men, 17 women), with a mean age of 72 +/- 8 years, were included. The mean of each series of readings on CT was significantly larger than the mean US-AP measurement (P < .001), and they also differed significantly from each other (P < .001). The CT-PCLF diameter was larger than CT-AP and CT-PME by mean values of 3.0 +/- 6.6 and 5.9 +/- 6.0 mm, respectively. The CT-ME diameter was larger than CT-PCLF by a mean of 2.4 +/- 5 mm. The US-AP diameter was smaller than CT-AP diameter by 4.2 +/- 4.9 mm, CT-ME by 9.6 +/- 8.0 mm, CT-PME by 1.3 +/- 5 mm, and smaller than CT-PCLF by 7.3 +/- 7.0 mm. Aneurysm size did not significantly affect these differences. Seventy-eight percent of 120 pairs of intraobserver CT measurements and 65% of interobserver CT measurements differed by <2 mm.\nCT-based measurements of aneurysm size tend to be larger than the US-AP measurement. CT-PCLF diameters are consistently larger than CT-PME as well as CT-AP measurements. These differences should be considered when applying evidence from previous trials to clinical decisions.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to assess the impact of surgery on quality of life (QOL) in patients who underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair.\nThis is a prospective single center cohort study using two quality of life questionnaires administered before surgery, at 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. The Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale (IIRS) is a tool that on a 7-point Likert scale assesses the impact of disease on each of 13 domains of quality of life. The Karnofsky Activity Scale (KAS) uses a single rating to assess the impact on overall quality of life. At each visit, participants completed the IIRS and KAS. Healthy, nonaneurysmal individuals also completed the IIRS to form a control group.\nFrom 1998 to 2006, 297 patients underwent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair at a tertiary care hospital. Quality of life was measured on 80 patients in total. Preoperative data was available in 45 patients (7 completed the IIRS and 3 the KAS only, and 35 both); 6-month postoperative data in 25 (1 completed the KAS only, and 24 both); and 1-year data postoperative in 35 (4 completed the IIRS and 2 the KAS only, and 29 both). Internal consistency was established for IIRS (Cronbach's alpha 0.85) and KAS (0.81). The mean preoperative IIRS score was 32.10 (SD 17.91). After surgery, there was no change at the 6-month and 1-year postoperative intervals: at 6 months, the mean IIRS score was 33.17 (SD 17.66) and at 1 year the mean was 28.09 (SD 13.61). Total IIRS in nonaneurysmal controls was 13.5 (SD 0.7). The mean preoperative Karnofsky Activity Scale score was 80.0 (SD 15.07), which corresponds to an ability to perform normal activity with effort and some signs or symptoms of disease. After surgery, there was no change as patients reported a 6-month mean score of 79.60 (SD 21.89), and a 1-year postoperative mean score of 86.94 (SD 13.94).\nQuality of life for patients undergoing TAAA repair who survive to attend follow-up in an ambulatory setting can be measured using reliable and valid instruments. Preoperatively, QOL is poor compared with healthy controls. After surgery, at 6- and 12-month follow-up, QOL seems to return to the preoperative levels. Further research is necessary to address responsiveness and sensitivity of QOL measuring tools.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) are inflammatory cells present in atherosclerotic lesions and neovascularized tissues. Recently, MCs were shown to modulate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation in a mouse model. Progression of aneurysmatic disease process may also depend on intraluminal thrombus and neovascularization of the aneurysm wall. Here we investigated the relationship between MCs and inflammation, neovascularization, and the presence of intraluminal thrombus in human AAA.\nSpecimens from AAAs and normal control aortas were analyzed with basic histology, immunohistochemical staining, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Double immunostainings with endothelial cell markers CD31/CD34 and MC tryptase showed that, in contrast to histologically normal aorta, MCs in AAA were abundant in the media, but absent from the intima. Medial MCs and (CD31/CD34)(+) neovessels increased significantly in AAA compared with normal aorta (P < .0001 for both), and the highest densities of neovessels and MCs were observed in the media of thrombus-covered AAA samples. Also, the proportional thickness of aortic wall penetrated by the neovessels was significantly higher in the AAA samples (P < .0001), and the neovascularized area correlated with the density of medial MCs (P < .0001). In histologic analysis, the medial MCs were mainly located adjacent to the stem cell factor (SCF)(+) medial neovessels. Real-time PCR analysis also showed that mRNA levels of genes associated with neovascularization (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], FLT1, VE-cadherin, CD31), and MCs (tryptase, chymase, cathepsin G) were higher in AAA samples than in controls. Demonstration of adhered platelets by CD42b staining and lack of endothelial cell (CD31/CD34) staining in the luminal surface of AAA specimens suggest endothelial erosion of the aneurysm walls.\nThe results support participation of MCs in the pathogenesis of AAA, particularly regarding neovascularization of aortic wall.",

Routine applicability of this technique in a wide spectrum of lesions and patients, stent patency, and clinical outcome forms the basis of this presentation.\nDuring a 9-year period, 167 limbs in 159 unselected patients in a consecutive series with post-thrombotic chronic total occlusions of the iliac and adjacent vein segments underwent percutaneous attempts at recanalization. Patients were not selected based on venographic appearance or extent of the lesion, or excluded because of a preemptive choice of open venovenous bypass surgery.\nPercutaneous recanalization was successful in 139 of 167 limbs (83%), including patients with bilateral occlusions and 14 patients with inferior vena cava filters incorporated in the treated occlusion. Median age was 53 years (range, 18-84 years). Thrombophilia was identified in 44 patients. Venous dermatitis/ulcer was found in 46% of the treated limbs. Recanalization involved three or more totally occluded vein segments in 42% of the limbs. The cumulative secondary stent patency rate at 4 years was 66%. The cumulative marked relief of pain and swelling at 3 years was 79% and 66%, respectively. Cumulative healing of venous ulcer at 33 months was 56%. Quality of life metrics improved significantly.\nMost femoroiliocaval chronic total occlusions lesions can be successfully recanalized percutaneously with very little morbidity, minimal downtime, sustained long-term stent patency, and substantial clinical improvement. The procedure has wide applicability in a broad spectrum of symptomatic patients, including those with extensive lesions, and can be considered for routine use.",

Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and bilateral ABI measurements were performed in each participant. The prevalence of stenosis >or=50% was evaluated in nine different arterial segments in both legs: common iliac artery (CIA), external iliac artery (EIA), common femoral artery (CFA), superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery (PA), tibioperoneal trunk (TPTr), anterior tibial artery (ATA), posterior tibial artery (PTA), and peroneal artery. The relations between the prevalences of stenosis in different arterial segments in the right and left leg were assessed. An evaluation was made of the relation between a >or=50% stenosis and an ABI <0.9 in the different segments.\nThe prevalence of stenosis was 0% to 21%. In all segments, a stenosis was more commonly found in one of the legs only than in both legs. The prevalence of >or=50% stenosis in the right leg only, left leg only, and both legs was 0.3%, 0.7%, and 0% in the CIA; 0.3%, 1.0%, and 0.7% in the EIA; 0%, 0%, and 0% in the CFA; 2.0%, 1.3%, and 0.7% in the SFA; 0.7%, 0.7%, and 0.3% in the PA; 1.0%, 0.7%, and 0% in the TPTr; 5.6%, 6.3%, and 8.6% in the ATA; 0.7%, 1.7%, and 0% in the peroneal artery; and in 2.0%, 2.7%, and 3.4% in the PTA. When the legs were compared, a significant correlation was found for the presence of a >or=50% stenosis in the EIA, SFA, PA, ATA, and PTA. Seventeen participants showed ABI <0.9. In logistic regression analysis with ABI <0.9 as dependent variable, stenosis in SFA, ATA, and PTA were the major independent variables to explain a low ABI in both of the legs.\nThe distribution of stenosis differs substantially when legs are compared.

    "abstract": "Controversy exists over the optimal hospital type to which high-risk surgical patients should be referred for operative management. While high volume centers have been traditionally advocated, recent evidence suggests teaching hospitals may have better outcomes for high-risk patients. We investigated whether mortality outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) were different between teaching hospitals and non-teaching hospitals, independent of hospital operative volume.\nA retrospective review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample dataset (1998-2004) was performed to identify open and endovascular (EVAR) repair for rAAA. Hospitals were stratified by teaching status, including teaching hospitals (TH) with any type of residency training program, those with general surgery training programs (GSTH) and those with vascular surgery training programs (VSTH). The association of hospital teaching status with in-hospital mortality for open AAA repair and EVAR was assessed via multi-level multivariable logistic regression, controlling for patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospital operative volume.\nOf 6636 open AAA repairs for rAAA, the overall perioperative mortality was 42%. Mortality was significantly lower at TH than non-TH (39.3% vs 44.5%; P < .05). Mortality was also lower at GSTH (38.7%) and VSTH (34.3%). After adjusting for hospital operative volume, patient demographics, and comorbidities, we found a 25% decrease in likelihood of in-hospital death at VSTH vs non-VSTH (odds ratio 0.75; 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.94; P < .05).\nIn-hospital mortality is significantly reduced for patients undergoing open AAA repair for rAAA at teaching hospitals and hospitals with vascular surgery training programs, independent of volume. These results suggest that in addition to factors associated with teaching hospitals in general, the type of specialty training within teaching institutions is a critical factor which may influence outcomes, specifically for patients with rAAA.",

    "abstract": "We report our single-center experience of early and midterm outcome after endovascular repair of mycotic aortic aneurysms (MAA).\nCase records were retrospectively reviewed of 11 patients who underwent endovascular repair of 13 MAAs between 2000 and 2007. The aneurysms were localized in the aortic arch in 1 patient, descending thoracic aorta in 4, suprarenal abdominal aorta in 3, and infrarenal abdominal aorta in 5.\nMean follow-up was 27 months. A bleeding aortoesophageal fistula resulted in one in-hospital death <or=30 days. Three patients died later: one each of sepsis, stent migration that caused intestinal ischemia, and an unknown cause. Two patients had recurrent sepsis postoperatively but no vascular complications, two had elevated inflammatory markers during follow-up but were asymptomatic, and three patients had an uneventful follow-up.\nEndovascular treatment for MAA was feasible, with acceptable perioperative mortality and midterm outcome in this single-center case series. Recurrent sepsis and late relapse with a second MAA occurred, indicating the need of long-term antibiotic therapy and follow-up, as well as the possible need for secondary open repair in selected cases. Further research is warranted to evaluate long-term outcome.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports have suggested that angioplasty, with and without stenting (PTA/S), may have a lower perioperative mortality rate than open surgery for revascularization of acute (AMI) and chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). It is unclear if there has been nationwide adoption of this methodology or whether there is actually a mortality benefit.\nWe identified all patients undergoing surgical (bypass, endarterectomy, or embolectomy) or PTA/S mesenteric revascularization from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988 to 2006. A diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revisioncoding of AMI or CMI was required for inclusion. We evaluated trends in management during this period and compared in-hospital death and complications between surgical bypass and PTA/S for the years 2000 to 2006.\nFrom 1988 to 2006, there were 6342 PTA/S and 16,071 open surgical repairs overall. PTA/S increased steadily, surpassing all surgery for CMI in 2002. PTA/S for AMI has also increased and surpassed bypass in 2002 but has not surpassed all surgical procedures for AMI even in 2006. The mortality rate was lower after PTA/S than after bypass for CMI (3.7% vs 13%, P < .01) and AMI (16% vs 28%, P < .01). Bowel resection was more common after bypass than PTA/S for CMI (7% vs 3%, P < .01). This subgroup showed an increased in-hospital mortality rate for both repair types (54% and 25%, respectively).\nPTA/S is being used with increasing frequency for revascularization of CMI and AMI. The lower in-hospital mortality rate for patients, as they are currently being selected, shows that PTA/S is appropriate therapy for selected patients with CMI. Longitudinal data are needed to determine the durability of this benefit. The greater proportion of patients undergoing bowel resection with bypass for AMI suggests a more advanced level of ischemia in this group, making comparison with PTA/S difficult. However, PTA/S may be useful in selected patients with AMI and appropriate anatomy. Further data with greater detail regarding symptomatology and anatomy will clarify appropriate patient selection.",

    "abstract": "The impact of risk factors upon perioperative mortality might differ for patients undergoing open vs endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). In order to investigate this, we developed a differential predictive model of perioperative mortality after AAA repair.\nA total of 45,660 propensity score matched Medicare beneficiaries undergoing elective open or endovascular AAA repair from 2001 to 2004 were studied. Using half the dataset we developed a multiple logistic regression model for a matched cohort of open and EVAR patients and used this to derive an easily evaluable risk prediction score. The remainder of the dataset formed a validation cohort used to confirm results.\nThe derivation cohort included 11,415 open and 11,415 endovascular repairs. Perioperative mortality was 5.3% and 1.8%, respectively. Independent predictors of mortality (relative risk [RR], 95% confidence interval [CI]) were open repair (3.2, 2.7-3.8); age (71-75 years 1.2, 0.9-1.6; 76-80 years 1.9, 1.4-2.5; >80 years 3.1, 2.4-4.2); female gender (1.5, 1.3-1.8); dialysis (2.6, 1.5-4.6); chronic renal insufficiency (2.0, 1.6-2.6); congestive heart failure (1.7, 1.5-2.1); and vascular disease (1.3, 1.2-1.6). There were no differential predictors of mortality across the two procedures. A simple scoring system was developed from a logistic regression model fit to both endovascular and open patients (area under the receiver operator curve [ROC] curve of 72.6) from which low, medium, and high risk groups were developed. The absolute predicted mortality ranged from 0.7% for an EVAR patient </=70 years of age with no comorbidities to 38% for an open patient >80 with all the comorbidities considered. Although relative risk was similar among age groups, the absolute difference was greater for older patients (with higher baseline risk).\nMortality after AAA repair is predicted by comorbidities, gender, and age, and these predictors have similar effects for both methods of AAA repair. This simple scoring system can predict repair mortality for both treatment options and thus may help guide clinical decisions.",

    "abstract": "Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) duplex scanning is utilized to screen for high-grade (>or=70%) SMA stenosis (peak systolic velocity [PSV] >or=275 cm/second) and for follow-up of SMA bypass grafts and stents. Expected duplex scan findings in SMA bypass grafts have been recently reported. There is, however, little information correlating duplex scans from stented SMAs to procedural angiograms in patients treated for high-grade (>or=70%) SMA stenosis. We report validation of duplex scan criteria for high-grade native artery SMA stenosis, and also duplex scan examined results after SMA stent placement correlated with angiograms and angiographic measured pressure gradients pre- and post-SMA stent placement.\nThirty-five patients with symptoms consistent with mesenteric ischemia were treated with SMA stents. Pre-intervention angiography demonstrated >70% SMA stenosis or SMA occlusion in all but 3 patients. Pre-intervention pressure gradients were obtained in 20 stenotic but patent SMAs and averaged 57 +/- 38 mm Hg; range, 15 to 187 mm Hg. Eighteen of the patients had SMA duplex scan prior to angiography, and 17 demonstrated an SMA PSV >or=275 cm/second or no flow, (mean 450 +/- 152 cm/second in patent arteries; range, 256 to 770 cm/second). Post-stent placement angiography demonstrated <30% SMA stenosis in all 35 patients. Post-stent pressure gradients were obtained in 22 patients and averaged 11 +/- 13 mm Hg; range, 0 to 45 mm Hg, (P < .001 compared to pre-stent pressure gradients in a paired test) and were elevated in patients with >or=60% celiac artery stenosis compared with those with <60% celiac artery stenosis (P < .006). Mean early post-stent duplex PSV scans obtained in 13 patients, were 336 +/- 45 cm/second; range, 279 to 416 cm/second (P = .011 compared to pre-stent PSVs).\nSMA stenting provides good anatomic results and significantly reduces measured pressure gradients. Duplex scans measured SMA PSVs are reduced post-stent placement but despite good angiographic results remain above criteria predicting high-grade native artery SMA stenosis. Duplex scan criteria developed to identify high-grade native artery SMA stenosis accurately predict high-grade native artery SMA stenosis but overestimate stenosis in stented SMAs. New duplex scan criteria are required to predict high-grade stenosis in stented SMAs.",

This study reports the use of pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis.\nA retrospective review of all patients with symptomatic DVT treated between 2007 and 2008 with PMT was performed. All patients were treated by a combination of local tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with the Angiojet (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, Minn) or Trellis device (Bacchus Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif). Catheter-directed lysis was used sparingly.\nForty-three patients (mean age, 48.4 +/- 16.6 years) presented with symptoms averaging 13.6 +/- 9.6 days in duration. Nineteen (44%) had symptoms for >14 days, and 15 (35%) had a high risk for bleeding. Symptomatic subclavian thrombosis occurred in eight (19%), and 35 (81%) presented with disabling lower extremity DVT (4 phlegmasia) despite anticoagulation. Fifteen patients had a thrombosed indwelling permanent filter. Sixty-three percent were treated in one session, but 16 patients required a lytic infusion after suboptimal PMT. Iliac stenting was required in 35% of limbs treated. Successful lysis (>50%) was achieved in 95% of patients and symptom resolution in 93%. All patients became ambulatory with no or minimal limitation. There were no major systemic bleeding complications, but access site hematoma occurred in two patients and worsening of pre-existing rectus sheath hematoma requiring transfusion occurred in another two. Limb salvage was maintained in 100% of patients who presented with phlegmasia. Mean follow-up was 5.0 +/- 4.8 months. Freedom from DVT recurrence and reintervention was 95% at 9 months by life-table analysis.\nPMT can be safely and effectively used for subacute iliocaval and iliofemoral DVT and in patients with contraindications for lytic therapy, resulting in improved functional outcomes relative to their debilitated state before the procedure.",

Nitinol stent implantation is reported to reduce restenosis in SFA after PTA in the general population; however, little is known about whether the nitinol stent improves primary patency after PTA in hemodialysis patients who are at higher risk of revascularization failure. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of nitinol stent implantation for primary patency in SFA after PTA in hemodialysis patients with PAD.\nEighty consecutive hemodialysis patients (167 SFA lesions) who underwent PTA with nitinol stents from January 2006 to January 2008 were compared with 64 hemodialysis patients (128 SFA lesions) who received stainless steel stents in the preceding 2 years. In the follow-up study to 2 years, incidence of restenosis, amputation, and all-cause mortality were analyzed. End points between the groups were examined with the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. Prognostic values for end points were calculated by a Cox univariate analysis and Cox multivariable regression models. To statistically minimize the differences in each stent group, a propensity-matched analysis was also performed using the model including male gender, age, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, incidence of ulcer/gangrene, and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) type C+D.\nThe 2-year primary patency rate was 58% in the nitinol group vs 42% in the stainless steel group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.84; P = .0045), despite a higher prevalence of TASC C+D lesion in the nitinol group (68% vs 49%, P = .0014). In 108 lesions matched after propensity score analysis, the primary patency for 2 years was 64% in the nitinol group vs 42% in the stainless steel group (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.24-0.65; P = .0003). Cox multivariate models showed nitinol stent (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25-0.73; P = .002), age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; P = .031), and incidence of ulcer/gangrene (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.17-4.75; P = .017) were independent predictors of restenosis.\nThese data suggest that nitinol stent implantation improves primary patency in SFA after PTA compared with the stainless steel stent, even in hemodialysis patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is commonly used as a minimally invasive technique for repairing infrarenal aortic aneurysms. There have been recent concerns that a subset of high-risk patients experience unfavorable outcomes with this intervention. To determine whether such a high-risk cohort exists and to identify the characteristics of these patients, we analyzed the outcomes of Medicare patients treated with EVAR from 2000-2006.\nWe identified 66,943 patients who underwent EVAR from Inpatient Medicare database. The overall 30-day mortality was 1.6%. A risk model for perioperative mortality was developed by randomly selecting 44,630 patients; the other one third of the dataset was used to validate the model. The model was deemed reliable (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics were P = .25 for the development, P = .24 for the validation model) and accurate (c = 0.735 and c = 0.731 for the development and the validation model, respectively).\nIn our scoring system, where scores ranged between 1 and 7, the following were identified as significant baseline factors that predict mortality: renal failure with dialysis (score = 7); renal failure without dialysis (score = 3); clinically significant lower extremity ischemia (score = 5); patient age >or=85 years (score = 3), 75-84 years (score = 2), 70-74 years (score = 1); heart failure (score = 3); chronic liver disease (score = 3); female gender (score = 2); neurological disorders (score = 2); chronic pulmonary disease (score = 2); surgeon experience in EVAR <3 procedures (score = 1); and hospital annual volume in EVAR <7 procedures (score = 1). The majority of Medicare patients who were treated (96.6%, n = 64,651) had a score of 9 or less, which correlated with a mortality <5%. Only 3.4% of patients had a mortality >or=5% and 0.8% of patients (n = 509) had a score of 13 or higher, which correlated with a mortality >10%.\nWe conclude that there is a high-risk cohort of patients that should not be treated with EVAR because of prohibitively high mortality; however, this cohort is small. Our scoring system, which is based on patient and institutional factors, provides criteria that can be easily used by clinicians to quantify perioperative risk for EVAR candidates.",

    "abstract": "Stent grafts are increasingly recognized as useful devices for endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms and other vascular diseases. Stent graft-mediated gene delivery into the vascular wall is expected to improve their therapeutic effects. This study evaluated the efficacy of genetically engineered cationized gelatin (CG) hydrogel-coated partially-covered polyester stent grafts that facilitate delivery of an expression plasmid DNA in rabbit aortic wall.\nPartially covered polyester stent grafts coated with CG hydrogel impregnated with 10.0 mg/mL of beta-galactosidase (LacZ)-expression plasmid vector (pCAGGS-LacZ) or empty vector (pCAGGS) solutions were implanted via the femoral artery in rabbit balloon-injured aortas. The aortic segments were removed at 1, 3, or 7 days (4 rabbits/each group) after implantation and evaluated for the transgene (LacZ) delivery and expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside) staining. Partially-covered polyester stent grafts coated with CG hydrogel impregnated with various amounts (0.1 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL, and 10.0 mg/mL) of pCAGGS-LacZ or pCAGGS were also implanted in rabbits' balloon-injured aortas (4 rabbits/each group) to evaluate transgene delivery and expression in the aortic wall 3 days after implantation. The difference of transgene efficiency among each group was compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-Keuls' test according to the result of quantitative RT-PCR.\nIn all animals, LacZ gene transduction into the aortic wall was detected at the implantation site of pCAGGS-LacZ-loaded, but not pCAGGS-loaded, stent grafts. LacZ expression was not detected in aortic segments immediately proximal or distal to the implanted pCAGGS-LacZ-loaded stent graft or remote organs including the brain, heart, liver, and kidney by either RT-PCR or X-gal staining. The X-gal staining-positive cells were observed at or near the luminal surface in the aortic segments only in contact with the stent graft and the ingrowth tissues within stent grafts. Immunohistochemical studies suggested that the LacZ-positive cells were mainly the neointimal alpha-smooth-muscle actin-positive cells and macrophages. The extent of the transgene expression was dependent on the quantity of the plasmid DNA loaded onto the stent graft (10.0 mg/mL plasmid vs 1.0 mg/mL plasmid, P < .01 and 10.0 mg/mL plasmid vs 0.1 mg/mL plasmid, P < .05). LacZ mRNA expression was maximal at day 1 and declined at day 7 (P < .05) but was still detectable.\nPlasmid-loaded CG hydrogel-coated stent graft is a promising vehicle for local transgene delivery to the aortic wall and offers the possibility of transduction of therapeutic genes into the vascular wall.",

    "abstract": "Image-guided surgery provides a mechanism to accurately and quickly assess the location of surgical tools relative to a preoperative image. Traditional image-guided surgery relies on infrared or radiofrequency triangulation to determine an instrument location relative to a preoperative image and has been primarily used in head and neck procedures. Advances in ultrasonic tracking devices, designed for tracking catheters within vessels, may provide an opportunity for image-guided endovascular procedures. This study evaluates the positional accuracy of an ultrasonic navigation system for tracking an endovascular catheter when different stents and graft materials have been deployed in an in vitro system.\nStent and graft materials commonly used in endovascular procedures were used for this study in combination with a custom three-head ultrasonic transducer navigation system. The stents evaluated were composed of Dacron/nitinol, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/nitinol, and bare nitinol. They were deployed into excised porcine tissue cannulized with a rotary drill, and a catheter with a custom microtransducer probe was inserted. The distance from each ultrasonic tracking module to a probe mounted on an endovascular catheter was measured using time of flight techniques, and the catheter position in three-dimensions was calculated using triangulation.\nThe measured position was compared to the actual catheter position determined by a precision translation stage. The PTFE/nitinol, bare nitinol, and Dacron/nitinol stent materials were evaluated and resulted in a maximum error of 1.7, 3.0, and 3.6 mm and an SD of 0.7, 1.2, and 1.4 mm, respectively. A reduction in signal intensity of up to 6x was observed during passage of the endovascular probe through the stent materials, but no reduction in the accuracy of the ultrasonic navigation system was evident.\nThe use of an ultrasonic-based navigation system is feasible in endovascular procedures, even in the presence of common stent materials. It may have promise as a navigational tool for endovascular procedures.",

It is important to review the data on all the components of the revenue cycle: payer contracting, appointment scheduling, preregistration, registration process, coding and capturing charges, proper billing of patients and insurers, follow-up of accounts receivable, and finally using appropriate benchmarking. The industry benchmarks used should be those of peers in identical groups. Warning signs of poor performance are discussed enabling the practice to formulate a performance improvement plan.",

    "abstract": "Four patients with high internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease were indicated for surgical endarterectomy and needed additional exposure besides regular head rotation and extension. When indicated, in our clinic this is usually achieved by mandibular subluxation with interdental wiring. Due to dental wear and periodontal disease, all 4 patients were edentulous. As a consequence, the technique of interdental wiring could not be used. In this technical note we will explain a method for interarch fixation with the use of two ipsilateral monocortical miniscrews and wiring, and the use of patients' pre-existing mandibular implants and provisional overdenture. This method gives rise to an additional exposure of 15 to 20 mm of the ICA.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Apart from traditional cardiovascular risk factors, several novel biologic mediators and genetic predisposing factors appear relevant in determining the atherogenetic process leading to PAD. Genes encoding for renin angiotensin system (RAS) components have been proposed as candidate in atherosclerosis. This study investigated four polymorphisms in angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), genes of RAS, in both predicting PAD and modulating the severity of the disease.\nThe ACE I/D and -240A>T, AGT M235T, and AGTR1 1166A>C polymorphisms were analyzed in 281 PAD patients and in 485 controls comparable for age and sex.\nThe ACE D and -240T alleles both significantly influenced the predisposition to PAD. The ACE D, but not -240 T, allele remained associated with PAD after Bonferroni correction (P = .004) and adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (P = .03). The ACE D allele influenced PAD predisposition with a dose-dependent effect (odds ratio for ACE ID vs II genotype, 1.77; P = .006; ACE DD vs II genotype, 2.15; P = .001). The haplotype reconstruction analysis for the ACE gene showed that the D/-240T haplotype significantly and independently influenced the predisposition to PAD (P = .02). In 190 PAD patients with no additional atherosclerotic localizations (isolated PAD), a significant association between ACE D and -240T alleles and PAD was observed. Only the ACE D allele remained associated with isolated PAD after Bonferroni correction (P = .02) and after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (P = .02). The haplotype reconstruction analysis for the ACE gene showed that the D/-240T, but not the D/-240A haplotype significantly influenced the predisposition to PAD (P = .0003). No influence of the polymorphisms analyzed on the severity of the disease, according to Rutherford categories, was found.\nThe present study contributes data to highlight the role of the ACED/-240T haplotype in predisposing to PAD, also in the absence of other atherosclerotic comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Direct comparison of transposed arteriovenous fistulas (tAVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) has been hampered by inherent differences in patient characteristics between tAVF and AVG groups. In this study, using matching to control patient variables, we evaluated our outcomes with upper arm tAVF and upper arm prosthetic AVG.\nA retrospective review of all newly created upper arm tAVF and AVG was performed. One hundred ninety upper arm tAVF were group matched for age, gender, race, diabetes, and history of previous failed access with 168 AVG chosen from a pool of 476 concurrently performed AVG procedures. Complication, patency, and intervention rates were compared using multivariate analysis.\nMean follow up for our cohort was 29.1 months. Transposed fistulae consisted of 119 basilic vein and 71 cephalic vein transpositions, which were found to have similar demographic parameters, complication rates, and patency rates. There were no differences in 30 day mortality, 24 hour thrombosis, bleeding requiring exploration, or ischemic steal requiring intervention between the tAVF and AVG groups. More AVG developed infection requiring operative exploration than tAVF (7.9% vs 1.6%, respectively. P = .004). Primary patency for tAVF was higher than for AVG: 48% vs 14% at five years (P < .0001). Secondary patency rate for tAVF was also higher than for AVG: 57% vs 19% at five years (P < .0001). Nine percent of tAVF compared with 53% of AVG required one or more surgical and/or percutaneous revisions to maintain secondary patency (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that utilization of a tAVF was associated with a reduced risk of primary (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.35-0.64, P < .0001) and secondary failure (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.81, P = .0001).\nTransposed arteriovenous fistulas have significantly higher primary and secondary patency rates, require fewer revisions, and are less likely to develop a significant infection than AVG. This study supports the contention that as long as a patient is a candidate for a tAVF based on anatomic criteria, a tAVF should be considered before an AVG.",

    "abstract": "Successful repair of the ruptured (non-traumatic) descending thoracic aorta (rTA) remains a formidable clinical challenge. Although effective for rTA, traditional open repair (DTAR) has significant associated morbidity. With expanding indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), we describe our experience with TEVAR and DTAR in this high-risk setting to elucidate their evolving roles.\nSince the inception of our thoracic aortic endovascular program in 1993, 69 patients underwent DTAR (34) or TEVAR (35) for rTA. Patients underwent TEVAR if they were considered nonoperative candidates because of extensive comorbidities (n = 31; 88.6%) or had extremely favorable anatomy for endovascular repair (eg, mid-descending saccular aneurysm, n = 4). Aortic pathology causing rupture was fusiform aneurysm (18), saccular aneurysm/ulcer (22), and dissection (29). Associated aortobronchial fistulae (12) and aortoesophageal (1) fistulae were also present in 18.8%. Arch repair was needed in 46; total descending repair was needed in 33. Follow-up was 100% complete (mean 37.4 months).\nMean age was 65.9 years (DTAR 60.3 year vs TEVAR 71.3 years, P = .005). In-hospital or 30-day mortality was seen in 13 patients (TEVAR n = 4; 11.4% vs DTAR n = 9; 26.5%, P = .13). Median length of stay was shorter after TEVAR (8 days vs DTAR 15 days, P = .02). Mean Kaplan-Meier survival was similar between groups (TEVAR 67.4 months vs DTAR 65.0 months, P = .7). By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of a composite outcome of early mortality, stroke, permanent spinal cord ischemia, or need for dialysis or tracheostomy included the presentation with hemodynamic instability (P < .001) and treatment with conventional open repair (P = .02).\nAn endovascular approach for the ruptured (non-traumatic) descending thoracic aorta reduces early morbidity, mortality, and duration of hospitalization, while providing equivalent late outcomes even in an older group largely considered high risk for open repair. These data support a paradigm shift, with TEVAR emerging as the preferred therapy for all patients presenting with descending aortic rupture.",

Neither cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermic circulatory arrest, nor aortic cross-clamping were used. During the same hospitalization, the patient underwent successful endograft explantation through a left thoracotomy.

    "abstract": "We report the case of a 70-year-old male with a complication of misplacement of a vena cava filter into the spinal canal. This likely happened as a result of penetration of the wire and filter sheath through the iliac vein or vena cava into the retroperitoneum, vertebral foramina, and spinal canal at the level of L2 and L3. Due to the patient's condition, the filter was not removed and no neurologic symptoms have occurred. This represents the first reported case of a filter deployment into the spinal canal. Although placement of vena cava filters is a relatively safe procedure, complications are seen commonly due to the large number of procedures performed. Spinal complications, however, are rarely reported. This is the first reported case of the inadvertent placement of a vena cava filter into the spinal canal.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate early and late results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in female patients in a large single center experience.\nOver a 12-year period ending in December 2007, 4009 consecutive primary and secondary CEAs in 3324 patients were performed at our institution. All patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database containing pre-, intra-, and postoperative parameters. Patients were female in 1200 cases (1020 patients; Group 1) and male in the remaining 2809 (2304 patients, Group 2). Early results in terms of intraoperative neurological events and 30-day stroke and death rates were analyzed and compared. Follow-up results were analyzed with Kaplan Meier curves and compared with log-rank test.\nPatients of Group 1 were more likely to have hyperlipemia, diabetes, and hypertension; patients of Group 2 were more likely to be smokers and to have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). There were no differences in terms of clinical status or degree of stenosis. Patients of Group 2 had a significantly higher percentage of contralateral carotid artery occlusion than patients in Group 1 (6.9% and 3.9%, respectively; P < .001). Thirty-day stroke and death rates were similar in the two groups (1.2% for both groups). Univariate analysis demonstrated the presence of CAD, PAD, diabetes, and contralateral carotid artery occlusion to significantly affect 30-day stroke and death rate in female patients. At multivariate analysis, only diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.9; P = .05) and contralateral occlusion (OR 7.4, 95% CI 0.03-0.6; P = .006) were independently associated with an increased perioperative risk of stroke and death. Median duration of follow-up was 27 months (range, 1-144 months). There were no overall differences between the two groups in terms of survival, freedom from ipsilateral stroke, freedom from any neurological symptom, and incidence of severe (>70%) restenosis. In contrast to male patients, univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that female patients with diabetes or contralateral occlusion had an increased risk of developing ipsilateral neurological events during follow-up.\nFemale sex per se does not represent an adjunctive risk factor during CEA, with early and long term results comparable to those obtained in male patients. However, in our study we found subgroups of female patients at higher surgical risk, requiring careful intra- and postoperative management.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an established therapy to prevent rupture in large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). As experience with this therapy has grown, treatment of more challenging anatomy has led to the identification of several new procedurally related complications. We report the case of a 67-year-old man with an asymptomatic, large infrarenal AAA with an associated left common iliac artery aneurysm. Endovascular therapy for an aortoiliac aneurysm involved prior coil embolization of his left internal iliac artery to allow conventional EVAR with extension to the external iliac artery of the left graft limb, thus excluding the left iliac aneurysm. He presented 6 weeks postoperatively with onset of left-sided scrotal pain and underwent emergency orchidectomy for ischemic infarction of his left testis. The histology report confirmed that the left testis was necrotic secondary to a thrombus in the testicular artery. To our knowledge, this is the first report of testicular infarction after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is exceedingly rare. Treatment options range from observation to anticoagulation to open surgery or endovascular repair. We present our experience to date in the management of isolated SMA dissections.\nA retrospective review of the vascular surgery and radiology databases from 1998 to 2008 was performed. In general, incidental radiologic findings of a dissection were managed expectantly. The decision to intervene was based on anatomic suitability, patient comorbidities and symptoms, and physician preference. Endovascular stents were placed using a brachial approach, with the choice of stent determined by physician preference. Patients who underwent endovascular stent placement (ESP) were maintained on antiplatelet therapy for 6 months postoperatively. Follow-up consisted of yearly office visits and adjunctive computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when clinically indicated.\nCT or MRI imaging identified nine patients (7 men, 2 women) with an isolated SMA dissection. One patient also had a concomitant celiac artery dissection. Median age was 70 years (range, 46-73 years). Median follow-up time was 32 months (range, 13.8-62.5 months). Presentations included an incidental radiologic finding in three patients and acute onset abdominal pain in six. Treatment included expectant management in four patients, anticoagulation in two, and ESP in three. ESP was performed primarily in two patients and in a third patient after initial management with anticoagulation failed. The reduction in the diameter of the true lumen was significantly greater in patients treated with ESP vs patients who were successfully managed expectantly or with anticoagulation (F = 15.59, P < .005). No procedural complications were associated with ESP.\nAn isolated SMA dissection is a rare entity that may be managed successfully in a variety of ways based on clinical presentation. Endovascular stenting can be performed with good results and may be the preferred treatment in patients with symptomatic isolated SMA dissections.",

The patient was initially diagnosed with a retroperitoneal sarcoma that may have involved the right renal vessels and the IVC. The Vascular Surgery Service was consulted intra-operatively when it became evident that the IVC was primarily involved. The patient was treated with total en-bloc excision of the infrarenal IVC tumor with concomitant interposition polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft caval replacement. The second patient was a 58-year-old female who presented with general malaise and anemia. This tumor began in the distal infrarenal IVC and extended cephalad to the suprahepatic IVC, ending approximately 2 cm below the right atrium. Intrapericardial IVC clamping was required for cephalad control in this patient, who was then treated with excision of the tumor and concomitant interposition PTFE graft caval replacement with reimplantation of the right renal vein. A review of this rare tumor is presented.",

    "abstract": "An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis, offering lower morbidity, mortality, and cost compared with grafts or catheters. Patients with a difficult access extremity have often lost all superficial veins, and even basilic veins may be obliterated. We have used brachial vein transposition AVFs (BVT-AVFs) in these challenging patients and review our experience in this report.\nThe study reviewed consecutive patients in whom BVT-AVFs were created from September 2006 to March 2009. Most BVT-AVFs were created in staged procedures, with the second-stage transposition operations completed 4 to 6 weeks after the first-stage AVF operation. A single-stage BVT-AVF was created when the brachial vein diameter was > or =6 mm.\nWe identified 58 BVT-AVF procedures, comprising 41 women (71.0%), 28 diabetic patients (48.3%), and 29 (50.0%) had previous access surgery. The operation was completed in two stages in 45 operations (77.6%) and was a primary transposition in 13 patients. However, five of these were secondary AVFs with previous distal AV grafts or AVFs placed elsewhere; effectively, late staged procedures. Follow-up was a mean of 11 months (range, 2.0-31.7 months). Primary patency, primary-assisted patency, and cumulative (secondary) patency were 52.0%, 84.9%, and 92.4% at 12 months and 46.2%, 75.5%, and 92.4% at 24 months, respectively. Harvesting the brachial vein was tedious and more difficult than harvesting other superficial veins. No prosthetic grafts were used.\nBVT-AVFs provide a suitable option for autogenous access when the basilic vein is absent in patients with difficult access extremities. Most patients required intervention for access maturation or maintenance. Most BVT-AVFs were created with staged procedures. Cumulative (secondary) patency was 92.4% at 24 months.",

    "abstract": "A common misconception is that marketing is synonymous with advertising. Marketing by physicians has undergone a transformation from the earlier unacceptable slick sales pitches to a more common sense, tasteful, comprehensive, and well thought out plan to reach potential patients.\nMarketing is a much broader concept comprising four aspects: product, price, promotion, and place. Marketing activities for a medical practice include not only external but internal tactics. Publicly available resources are available to assist physicians in developing and targeting the plan towards a narrow patient demographic. The marketing process includes: determining objectives, identifying resources, defining target population, honing a message, outlining a media plan, implementing the plan, and finally, evaluating the success or failure of the marketing campaign.\nA basic knowledge of marketing combined with a common sense approach can yield dividends for those practices that need the service. For surgical practices that exist in heavily populated urban areas with significant competition, a well thought out marketing plan can assist the practice in reaching out to new groups of patients and maintaining the existing patient base.",

PTA with provisional \"bailout\" stent implantation is currently an accepted treatment for arterial obstructions in CLI, including those in below-the-knee arteries. A drawback compared to open bypass surgery is the relatively high restenosis rate. One proposed method to reduce restenosis is the use of drug-eluting stents (DES), as these have shown good results in the coronary bed. Primary DES implantation for focal obstructions in infrapopliteal arteries in CLI potentially reduces restenosis compared to PTA alone and may subsequently prolong effect of treatment, allowing for better wound healing, and preventing recurrence of symptoms. In this article, we report on rationale, design, and progress of the PADI trial, which investigates the safety and efficacy of a paclitaxel-eluting stent system compared to PTA with provisional bare metal stent implantation.",

    "abstract": "The use of mineral (clay) or biologic (chitosan) materials has improved the efficacy of dressings used in the bleeding control of noncompressible areas. A series of novel manufactured products already evaluated in a vascular transection model was further compared in a severe vascular puncture injury model.\nTen hemostatic dressings were tested in anesthetized Yorkshire swine hemorrhaged for 45 seconds in a femoral arterial puncture model. Application of these dressings was followed by 5 minutes of compression (about 175 mm Hg), and at 15 minutes, 500 mL resuscitation fluid (Hextand) was infused during a 30-minute period. The animals were monitored for a 3-hour experimental observation period. Primary outcomes were incidence of bleeding after dressing application and animal survival.\nBlood loss was 18.8% +/- 5.2% estimated blood volume (EBV) after 45 seconds of free bleeding. Relative performance of dressings is characterized as groups of dressings that performed similarly. Recurrence of bleeding after application was observed with most dressings and was lower with Woundstat, Celox, X-Sponge, and ACS+ (35% +/- 49%) compared with FP-21, Hemcon, Chitoflex, and Bloodstop (79% +/- 43%; P < .01). Blood loss after treatment was 25.3% +/- 18.4% EBV for the top four dressings and 53.0% +/- 18.4% EBV for the bottom four (P < .05). Survival was higher for top four vs bottom four dressings (78% +/- 12% vs 25% +/- 0%, respectively; P < .01). Overall performance of these dressings according to survival, incidence of bleeding, and post-treatment blood loss, yielded similar ranking as with a previously tested transection injury model.\nThe findings indicated that the efficacy of Woundstat, Celox, X-Sponge, and ACS+ were similar and superior in improving survival, hemostasis, and maintenance of mean arterial pressure in an actively bleeding wound caused in this severe vascular injury model.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) plays a role in the pathogenesis of vein graft spasms. It is suggested that smooth muscle 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors contribute to 5-HT-induced contraction, while endothelial 5-HT(1B) receptors contribute to the 5-HT-induced endothelium-mediated relaxation. We recently found that chronic administration of the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist sarpogrelate hydrochloride (SH) enhances the function of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) in rabbit vein grafts. However, it is unknown if such treatment modulates 5-HT-induced vasospasm in vein grafts, and if so, what the underlying mechanisms are.\nMale rabbits were divided into two groups: a control group and an SH-treated group. The jugular vein was interposed in the carotid artery in reversed fashion. Isometric tension was examined using vein grafts after 4 weeks. 5-HT (10(-8) -10(-6) M)-induced contraction was obtained in each group in the absence or presence of the NO synthase inhibitor l-N(G)-nitroarginine (L-NNA). The expression of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors was examined immunohistochemically.\nThe 5-HT induced a concentration-dependent contractions in both groups. L-NNA did not significantly modify the 5-HT-induced contraction in the control group but enhanced it in the SH group. The 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist GR55562 inhibited the 5-HT-induced contraction in the control group, while it increased the sensitivity of contraction to 5-HT in the SH-treated group in the absence (but not in the presence) of L-NNA. Positive immunoreactivities against 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(2A) receptors were identified in endothelial and medial regions of vein grafts in both groups, and the expression of 5-HT(2A) receptors (but not 5-HT(1B) receptors) was significantly less in the SH-treated group than in the control group.\nChronically administered SH to rabbits upregulates the autoinhibitory mechanism by 5-HT through a release of NO from endothelium via an activation of endothelial 5-HT(1B) receptors, thus attenuating its own contraction in vein grafts. Furthermore, such SH treatment downregulates the expression of smooth muscle 5-HT(2A) receptors, thus further attenuating the 5-HT-induced contraction. These novel findings further support the clinical usefulness of SH in vein graft spasm after bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "This report describes the change in atherosclerotic renovascular disease (AS-RVD) among hypertensive adults referred for renal duplex sonography (RDS) scan.\nFrom Oct 1993 through July 2008, 20,994 patients had RDS at our center. A total of 434 hypertensive patients with two or more RDS exams without intervention comprised the study cohort. Patient demographics (blood pressures, medications, serum creatinine levels, and data from RDS) were collected. Analyses of longitudinal changes in Doppler scan parameters, blood pressures, and renal function were performed by fitting linear growth-curve models. After confirming the linearity of change in Doppler scan parameters among patients with variable number of studies, estimates of mean slopes were calculated using maximum likelihood techniques. For changes in renal function, quadratic growth curves were required to describe longitudinal change.\nA total of 434 subjects (212 men [49%] and 222 women [51%]; mean age, 64.6 +/- 12.2 years) provided 1351 studies (mean, 3.2 +/- 2.4; range, 2 to 18) for 863 kidneys over a mean follow-up of 34.4 +/- 25.1 months. At baseline, 20.6% of kidneys demonstrated hemodynamically significant stenosis. On follow-up, 72 kidneys (9.1%) demonstrated anatomic progression of disease. A total of 54 kidneys (6.9%) progressed to significant stenosis and 18 (2.3%) progressed to occlusion. Controlling for progression of disease, baseline renal artery status demonstrated a strong association with baseline kidney length (P = .0006). Significant annualized change in renal length was observed (cm change/year +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]: 0.042 +/- 0.011; P = .0002) among both kidneys with and without critical disease at baseline, however, decline in length was significantly greater among kidneys exhibiting progression of renovascular disease (-0.152 +/- 0.028 cm/year; comparison of slopes between groups P = .0005). In the absence of progression, the presence or absence of critical renal artery stenosis at baseline did not affect the rate of decline in renal length. Fitted models for the natural log transform of serum creatinine demonstrated a significant increase during follow-up (P < .0001). No association was observed between change in serum creatinine and baseline renovascular disease status, or its progression.\nA total of 32% of hypertensive adults referred for RDS demonstrated hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. Regardless of the presence or absence of baseline disease, a small percentage of patients demonstrated anatomic progression of AS-RVD. A total of 9.1% demonstrated anatomic progression and 2.3% progressed to occlusion. Although anatomic progression of AS-RVD was associated with an increased rate of decline in renal length, progression did not predict a decline in excretory renal function.

    "abstract": "Significant hypotension after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS) has been correlated with adverse outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine risk factors that predict hypotension after patients undergo CEA and CAS.\nThe review included 1474 CEA patients and 157 CAS patients who underwent procedures from 2002 to 2008. Specific patient characteristics, such as comorbid diseases, degree of carotid stenosis, presence of neurologic symptoms, and preprocedure medications, were assessed. Also reviewed were specific postprocedural clinical outcomes, including hypotension requiring pressors, myocardial infarction, stroke, death, and hospital length of stay.\nThe incidence of clinically significant hypotension was 12.6% in CEA patients and 35% in CAS patients (P < .001). Clinically significant hypotension was correlated with increased postprocedural myocardial infarction (2.1% vs 0.5%, P = .022), increased mortality (2.1% vs 0.1%, P < .001), and length of stay >2 days (46.3% vs 27.4%, P = .01). Hypotension was not associated with increased postprocedural strokes (0.8% vs 0.6%, P = .75) or recurrent neurologic symptoms (0.4% vs 0.3%, P = .55). Preoperative nitrate use predicted a greater incidence of postprocedural hypotension (P = .043). A history of tobacco use was correlated with postprocedure hypotension (P = .033). Preprocedural strokes, the use of calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, prior myocardial infarction, degree of preprocedural carotid stenosis, type of stent, previous ipsilateral and contralateral interventions, and female gender did not correlate with postprocedural hypotension (P >.05).\nPostprocedural hypotension occurs more commonly with CAS than CEA and is associated with increased postprocedural myocardial infarction and length of stay, and death. Nitrates and tobacco use predict a higher incidence of postprocedural hypotension. High-risk patients should be aggressively managed to prevent the increased morbidity and mortality due to postprocedural hypotension.",

    "abstract": "Surgical intervention in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) can affect sexual functions, resulting in a negative impact on the quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate the preoperative information given about sexual functions and to compare the functional changes after open (OR) and endovascular repair (EVAR) for patients with AAA during one year after treatment.\nSeventy-six patients participated in the study (40 OR and 36 EVAR). A questionnaire was used to measure the sexual function preoperatively, and then after one month and one year following surgical interventions. Four aspects related to sexual function were studied: interest in sex, quality of erection, ability to achieve orgasm, and ejaculation. Two questions about the preoperative information covering the sexual function and another two questions about the patients concern for their sexual activities were also added. Fisher's exact test was used to test for significant relative changes within each group of treatment for the variables studied.\nNinety-one percent reported that they did not receive any preoperative information about the risk for any possible negative impact on the sexual function. None of the EVAR patients were given such information. Forty-two percent of all patients felt some anxiety about having sex before the operation, which decreased to 7% after one year. About 22% reported having strong/moderate ability of their erection and 54% reported this as being weak/very weak preoperatively. Patients who preoperatively had reported some form of sexual interest had experienced a significant impairment in sex (P < .039) one year after the interventions. Patients treated with EVAR reported a significant impairment in the quality of erection (P < .033) and their ability to achieve ejaculation (P < .047) one year after the operation. A similar tendency was seen in the OR group, but did not achieve statistical significance.\nFew patients were given or understood any preoperative information concerning the risk and possibility of a negative impact on their sexual function following surgical interventions. This was especially reported by patients in the EVAR group. Following the operation, the reported sexual interest and ability was decreased among patients in both groups. When only those patients who had reported some form of interest in sexual activity before the intervention were analyzed, a small significant impairment in quality of erection and achieving ejaculation could be found during the one year follow-up in the EVAR group.",

When only those patients who had reported some form of interest in sexual activity before the intervention were analyzed, a small significant impairment in quality of erection and achieving ejaculation could be found during the one year follow-up in the EVAR group.",

None of the EVAR patients were given such information. Forty-two percent of all patients felt some anxiety about having sex before the operation, which decreased to 7% after one year. About 22% reported having strong/moderate ability of their erection and 54% reported this as being weak/very weak preoperatively. Patients who preoperatively had reported some form of sexual interest had experienced a significant impairment in sex (P < .039) one year after the interventions. Patients treated with EVAR reported a significant impairment in the quality of erection (P < .033) and their ability to achieve ejaculation (P < .047) one year after the operation. A similar tendency was seen in the OR group, but did not achieve statistical significance.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies have demonstrated higher in-hospital mortality in women undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The current study evaluates the relationship between gender and 30-day outcomes for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in a multicenter, contemporary patient population.\nPatients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) participant use file that underwent EVAR of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from 2005 to 2007 were identified by CPT codes. Outcomes analyzed were 30-day mortality, morbidity (one or more of 21 complications defined by the ACS NSQIP protocol), length of hospital stay, and six complication subgroups. Preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and outcomes were compared across genders using chi(2) (binary and categorical variables) and t tests (continuous variables). The relationship of gender to outcomes was further evaluated using multivariate logistic regressions to adjust for pre- and intraoperative risk variables.\nIn 3662 EVAR patients, 647 (17.7%) were women and 3015 (82.3%) men with mean ages of 75.1 +/- 9.0 and 73.7 +/- 8.5 years (P < .001). Tube graft (360, 9.8%); bifurcated, one docking limb (1624, 44.3%); bifurcated, two docking limbs (1294, 35.3%); unibody (218, 5.9%); and aorto-uni-iliac/femoral (166, 4.4%) repairs were performed. Tube and aorto-uni-iliac/femoral grafts were more common in women (21.4% vs 12.8%, P < .001) than men, as were femoral/femoral crossovers (3.9% vs 1.8%, P = .011) and iliac or brachial exposures (2.8% vs 1.0%, P = .009). Overall morbidity and mortality were 11.9% and 2.1%, respectively. Mortality in women was significantly higher (3.4% vs 2.1%, P = .014), as was morbidity (17.8% vs 10.6%, P < .001). Of thirteen independent preoperative risk factors for mortality or morbidity, women had a higher incidence in five: emergent operation, functional dependence, recent weight loss, underweight status or morbid obesity, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After adjustment for these variables, the odds ratio (OR) for mortality in women vs men was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-2.69, P = .157); OR for morbidity was 1.65 (95% CI 1.28-2.14, P < .001). Female gender was also found to be an independent risk factor for length of stay (Beta 0.7 days, 95% CI 0.2-1.2, P = .006), infectious complications (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.03, P = .011), wound complications (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.12-2.90, P = .015) and postoperative transfusion (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.39-6.13, P = .002).\nMortality and morbidity were higher in women than men undergoing EVAR. Multivariate analysis showed that the increased risk of mortality was related to women presenting more emergently, more debilitated (recent weight loss and functional dependence), and requiring iliac or brachial exposure. After adjustment for multiple preoperative and operative factors, women remained at significantly higher risk for the development of a broad range of complications and increased length of stay.",

    "abstract": "The effects of a new long-term subcutaneous vascular access device were studied in access-challenged patients who were poor candidates for fistulas or grafts due to venous obstruction. Bacteremia rates, patency, and function of the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) Vascular Access Device (Hemosphere Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) were evaluated.\nThe HeRO device consists of a 6-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft attached to a 5-mm nitinol-reinforced silicone outflow component designed to bypass venous stenoses and enter the internal jugular vein directly, providing continuous arterial blood flow into the right atrium. The HeRO device was studied in a multicenter clinical trial to test the hypothesis that access-challenged patients would experience a statistically significant reduction in bacteremia rates compared with a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) literature control of 2.3/1000 days. HeRO-related bacteremia rates, adequacy of dialysis, patency, and adverse events were analyzed.\nThe HeRO device was implanted in 36 access-challenged patients who were followed for a mean 8.6 months (9931 HeRO days). The HeRO-related bacteremia rate was 0.70/1000 days. All HeRO-related bacteremias occurred during the bridging period when a TDC was still implanted before HeRO graft incorporation. HeRO adequacy of dialysis (mean Kt/V) was 1.7. HeRO primary patency was 38.9%, and secondary patency was 72.2%.\nIn access-challenged patients, a statistically significant reduction in HeRO-related bacteremia was noted compared with TDC literature. The device had similar function and patency compared with conventional arteriovenous graft literature.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) share common risk factors with atherosclerosis, except for diabetes which appears protective. The reason for this is unknown. Although increased circulating concentrations of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) such as carboxymethyllysine (CML) are associated with occlusive vascular disease, it is possible that their effects on the aortic wall explain the paradoxically low incidence of AAAs in diabetes.\nWe studied 234 community-dwelling men aged 65 to 79 years. The cases comprised all identifiable diabetic men with AAA (aortic diameter > or =30 mm on ultrasound; n = 27) and randomly-selected non-diabetic men with AAA (n = 67). Controls were age-matched randomly-selected diabetic men (n = 69) and age-matched randomly-selected non-diabetic men (n = 71) without AAA (aortic diameter 18 to 22 mm). Serum CML concentrations were measured by validated indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nSerum CML concentrations were significantly lower in men with AAAs than those without (6627 +/- 1544 vs 7309 +/- 1490 nmol/mol lysine; P = .001). Variables positively associated with AAA were height, diastolic blood pressure, smoking, a history of coronary heart disease, and serum creatinine (P < or = .040), while serum CML (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] per 1000 nmol/mol lysine; 0.80 [0.64-0.98]) and a history of diabetes were inversely associated (P < or = .040). After adjusting, the interaction between diabetes status and serum CML was negatively associated with AAA (P = .016).\nThese cross-sectional data show that circulating concentrations of CML are reduced in diabetic men with AAAs. This is in contrast to studies of the relationship between AGEs and occlusive manifestations of cardiovascular disease and could explain the inverse association between diabetes and AAA.",

The primary endpoint, completion of healing within a defined time frame, and the secondary endpoints, time to healing, and pain were entered into a meta-analysis using the tools of the Cochrane Collaboration. Additional subjective endpoints were summarized.\nEight RCT (published 1985-2008) fulfilled the predefined criteria. Data presentation was adequate and showed moderate heterogeneity. The studies included 692 patients (21-178/study, mean age 61 years, 56% women). Analyzed were 688 ulcerated legs, present for 1 week to 9 years, sizing 1 to 210 cm(2). The observation period ranged from 12 to 78 weeks. Patient and ulcer characteristics were evenly distributed in three studies, favored the stocking groups in four, and the bandage group in one. Data on the pressure exerted by stockings and bandages were reported in seven and two studies, amounting to 31-56 and 27-49 mm Hg, respectively. The proportion of ulcers healed was greater with stockings than with bandages (62.7% vs 46.6%; P < .00001). The average time to healing (seven studies, 535 patients) was 3 weeks shorter with stockings (P = .0002). In no study performed bandages better than MCS. Pain was assessed in three studies (219 patients) revealing an important advantage of stockings (P < .0001). Other subjective parameters and issues of nursing revealed an advantage of MCS as well.\nLeg compression with stockings is clearly better than compression with bandages, has a positive impact on pain, and is easier to use.",

Data on the pressure exerted by stockings and bandages were reported in seven and two studies, amounting to 31-56 and 27-49 mm Hg, respectively. The proportion of ulcers healed was greater with stockings than with bandages (62.7% vs 46.6%; P < .00001). The average time to healing (seven studies, 535 patients) was 3 weeks shorter with stockings (P = .0002). In no study performed bandages better than MCS. Pain was assessed in three studies (219 patients) revealing an important advantage of stockings (P < .0001). Other subjective parameters and issues of nursing revealed an advantage of MCS as well.",

    "abstract": "Unquestionably, the federal government has created financial incentives for vascular interventionists to perform procedures in their offices rather than in a hospital setting. While office venous ablations have been widely embraced by the vascular community, those involving the arterial system have not. One important reason may be related to the cost of the fluoroscopic equipment. Herein, we report on 32 office-based duplex scan-guided balloon angioplasty cases for failing or nonmaturing arteriovenous (AV) access.\nTwenty-five patients (14 males; 11 females; mean age 65.1 +/- 9.11) with chronic renal insufficiency underwent 32 office-based ultrasound scan-guided balloon angioplasties of their autologous AV fistulas. Twenty-seven procedures were performed in fistulas that did not mature while the remaining five were performed in failing AV accesses. The indications for these procedures were severe stenoses (>70%) as measured by color duplex scan and confirmed by peak systolic velocity (PSV) step-up >3. Preoperative duplex scan-derived mean volume flows (VFs) and highest stenotic PSV were recorded and compared with postoperative findings. Access site puncture and cannulation with short sheath, wire, and balloon advancement and inflation were guided by duplex scan only. A comparison of revenue for hospital-based vs office-based procedures was performed.\nAll procedures were successfully completed without fluoroscopy and contrast material. There were no systemic complications. One patient (3%) developed an arm hematoma due to focal vein rupture which was controlled by a hand compression for 20 minutes. An additional patient (3%) had a focal intraluminal dissection not obstructing the flow. Comparison of preoperative mean VF (350 +/- 180 mL/minute) and postoperative mean VF (933 +/- 332 mL/minute) demonstrated a statistically significant increase with P < .0001. Preoperative mean PSV 582 +/- 923 cm/second decreased to postoperative 1 mean PSV 244 +/- 97 cm/second (P < .0001). After deduction of procedure-related expenses ($730/case) from the global fee, the net income from these 32 cases totaled $51,746, making the return 4.32 times higher than that of the hospital setting (potential professional fee for the same cases - $11,983).\nThis early experience suggests that office-based endovascular repair of AV access under duplex scan-guidance is feasible and safe. The superficial location of AV access facilitates duplex scan visualization. This proposed approach averts contrast material use and radiation exposure. Finally, it appears to be financially more lucrative than the same hospital-based procedures.",

    "abstract": "Early limb occlusions following endovascular treatment of aorto-iliac aneurysmal disease is not uncommon (4%-13%). To assess whether the femoral artery entry site could potentially cause this complication, we prospectively evaluated the ipsilateral common femoral artery (CFA) and distal external iliac artery (EIA) with intraoperative duplex scans (IDS).\nThere were 134 patients with infrarenal nonruptured abdominal aorto-iliac aneurysms treated with endografts since 2002 at our institution. Age ranged from 65 to 89 years (mean: 77 +/- 7 years). Aneuryx (n = 41), Zenith (n = 50), and Excluder (n = 43) endografts were used for repair. All procedures were performed via open exposure of the CFA. Introducer diameter varied from 12 mm to 22 mm. All patients underwent IDS of the CFA and distal EIA after repair of the arteriotomies.\nIn 34 patients (25%), we documented intimal dissections causing severe (>70%) stenoses. Of the 271 arteries that were examined, 38 (14%) had abnormal findings that demanded intervention. These were repaired with flap excision, tacking sutures revision, or patch angioplasty (n = 36). Repeat IDS confirmed the adequacy of the repair. No statistical difference was noted if the site of larger introducer sheath and the incidence of flap formation. In addition, 10 small flaps or plaques were visualized but did not create significant stenosis. No differences were noted in the incidence of positive duplex exams between each type graft (P = .4). No early or late iliac limb occlusions were noted. Follow-up of 94% was obtained.\nCompletion arterial duplex scans are helpful in detecting a substantial number of clinically unsuspected technical defects caused by introducer sheaths. Timely diagnosis and repair of these defects may decrease the incidence of early limb occlusion following endograft placement.",

    "abstract": "Extremity vascular injury during the current war has been defined by anecdotal description and case series. These reports focused on estimation of short-term limb viability and technical description of commonly used adjuncts. Temporary vascular shunting (TVS) has been advocated in current care structures, yet mostly due to war environments, broader statistical scrutiny is lacking. This study's purpose is to provide perspective on TVS's impact on limb salvage, and estimate longer-term freedom from amputation.\nData from the Joint Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR), Balad Vascular Registry (BVR), Walter Reed Vascular Registry (WRVR), electronic medical records, and patient interviews were collected on American Troops sustaining extremity vascular injury from June 2003 through December 2007. Those in whom arterial TVS utilization was identified comprise the TVS group. These were compared with controls with similar injury date and anatomic location managed without TVS. Descriptive statistics were employed establishing overall univariate predictors of amputation and comparison between groups. Proportional-hazards modeling, with propensity score adjustment for systemic injury severity and Level 2 care, characterized risk factors of limb loss and effect of TVS. Freedom from amputation was estimated using Kaplan Meier log-rank methods.\nCases and controls consisted of 64 and 61 extremity arterial injuries, respectively. Mean follow-up was 22 months (range: 1-54 months). The TVS group was more severely injured (mean injury severity score [ISS]: 18 [SD = 10] TVS vs. 15 [SD = 10] control, P = .05) and more likely to receive Level 2 care (TVS: 26%; control: 10%, P = .02). Overall, a total of 26 amputations occurred (21%). Penetrating blasts, compared with gunshot wounds, were associated with amputation (30% vs. 6%, P = .002). After propensity score adjustment, use of TVS suggested a reduced risk of amputation (relative risk [RR] = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.18-1.19]; P = .11). Venous repair was associated with limb salvage (RR = 0.2; 95% CI [0.04-0.99], P = .05). Associated fracture (RR = 5.0; 95% CI [1.45-17.28], P = .01), and elevated mangled extremity severity score (MESS) ([MESS 5-7] RR = 3.5, 95% CI [0.97-12.36], P = .06; [MESS 8-12] RR = 16.4; 95% CI (3.79-70.79), P < .001) predicted amputation. Amputation-free survival was 78% in the TVS group and 77% in the control group at three years (P = .5).\nTemporary vascular shunting used as a damage control adjunct in management of wartime extremity vascular injury does not lead to worse outcomes. Benefit from TVS is suggested, but not statistically significant. Injury specific variables of venous ligation, associated fracture, and penetrating blast mechanism are associated with amputation. Amputation-free survival after vascular injury in Operation Iraqi Freedom is 79% at three years. Further studies to statistically define any possible benefits of TVS are needed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate current evidence in the literature on the efficacy of Semmes Weinstein monofilament examination (SWME) in diagnosing diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).\nThe PubMed database was searched through August 2008 for articles pertaining to DPN and SWME with no language or publication date restrictions. Studies with original data comparing the diagnostic value of SWME with that of one or more other modalities for DPN in patients with diabetes mellitus were analyzed. Data were extracted by two independent investigators. Diagnostic values were calculated after classifying data by reference test, SWME methodology, and diagnostic threshold.\nOf the 764 studies identified, 30 articles were selected, involving 8365 patients. There was great variation in both the reference test and the methodology of SWME. However, current literature suggests that nerve conduction study (NCS) is the gold standard for diagnosing DPN. Four studies were identified which directly compared SWME with NCS and encompassed 1065 patients with, and 52 patients without diabetes mellitus. SWME had a sensitivity ranging from 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44% to 68%) to 93% (95% CI, 77% to 99%), specificity ranging from 75% (95% CI, 64% to 84%) to 100% (95% CI, 63% to 100%), positive predictive value (PPV) ranging from 84% (95% CI, 74% to 90%) to 100% (95% CI, 87% to 100%), and negative predictive value (NPV) ranging from 36% (95% CI, 29% to 43%) to 94% (95% CI, 91% to 96%).\nThere is great variation in the current literature regarding the diagnostic value of SWME as a result of different methodologies. To maximize the diagnostic value of SWME, a three site test involving the plantar aspects of the great toe, the third metatarsal, and the fifth metatarsals should be used. Screening is vital in identifying DPN early, enabling earlier intervention and management to reduce the risk of ulceration and lower extremity amputation.",

    "abstract": "Left renal vein division and ligation (LRVDAL) is performed to facilitate complex abdominal aortic surgery. Surgeons restore continuity of the vein due to concern that ligation could cause renal compromise or hematuria. However, we report the short and long-term safety of left renal vein division and ligation.\nBetween 1992 and 2007, we divided the left renal vein in 56 patients (40 males, 16 females) ages 57 to 84 (average 74-years-old) who were treated for aortic occlusive disease (9) or abdominal aortic aneurysm (47). Patients requiring concomitant renal artery reconstruction were excluded from this review. Suprarenal cross-clamp was used in 51 patients with temporary vessel-loop control of the renal arteries. Creatinine (Cr) and glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) were measured pre-, post-, and long-term after surgery. Outpatient records of all patients that had survived more than 12 months were also reviewed in order to evaluate the late effects on renal function or symptoms possibly related to LRVDAL.\nMedian procedure duration was 157 (61-375) minutes. Median cross-clamp time was 16 (10-45) minutes. Median intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stays were 2 (1-11) days and 7 (4-58) days, respectively. There were no deaths. There were no complications directly related to renal vein ligation. Hematuria, seen in 2 patients, was a result of traumatic insertion of a Foley catheter. Median pre-op and discharge Cr levels were 1.1 mg/dL (0.7-2.4 mg/dL) and 1.1 mg/dL (0.6-2.1 mg/dL), respectively (P < .5). Median change in Cr was 0.0 mg/dL and only increased in 14 patients (maximum increase 0.9 mg/dL). Median pre-op and discharge eGFR was 61 mL/minute (28-137 mL/minute/1.73 m2) and 67 mL/minute (32-138 mL/minute/1.73 m2), respectively (P < .5). Cr and eGFR in the 2 patients with a Cr of >2.0 mg/dL remained unchanged post-op. Only 2 patients with a Cr of <2.0 mg/dL had a post-op Cr >2.0 mg/dL and both returned to normal by day 3 post-op. Thirty-six patients have been followed for more than a year (median 34.5 months, maximum 144 months) and Cr has remained stable in all but 2 patients. These 2 patients, both with a pre-op Cr of 1.5 mg/dL, subsequently developed Cr levels of 2.1 mg/dL and 2.4 mg/dL but maintained baseline Cr levels for 25 and 34 months, respectively, before demonstrating these elevated levels which have proven to be unrelated to renal vein ligation. Hematuria and flank pain have never been recorded after discharge.\nRestoration of left renal vein continuity after LRVDAL may be unnecessary since renal compromise and hematuria was not encountered in this long-term analysis.",

Patients requiring concomitant renal artery reconstruction were excluded from this review. Suprarenal cross-clamp was used in 51 patients with temporary vessel-loop control of the renal arteries. Creatinine (Cr) and glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) were measured pre-, post-, and long-term after surgery.

There were no complications directly related to renal vein ligation. Hematuria, seen in 2 patients, was a result of traumatic insertion of a Foley catheter. Median pre-op and discharge Cr levels were 1.1 mg/dL (0.7-2.4 mg/dL) and 1.1 mg/dL (0.6-2.1 mg/dL), respectively (P < .5). Median change in Cr was 0.0 mg/dL and only increased in 14 patients (maximum increase 0.9 mg/dL). Median pre-op and discharge eGFR was 61 mL/minute (28-137 mL/minute/1.73 m2) and 67 mL/minute (32-138 mL/minute/1.73 m2), respectively (P < .5). Cr and eGFR in the 2 patients with a Cr of >2.0 mg/dL remained unchanged post-op. Only 2 patients with a Cr of <2.0 mg/dL had a post-op Cr >2.0 mg/dL and both returned to normal by day 3 post-op. Thirty-six patients have been followed for more than a year (median 34.5 months, maximum 144 months) and Cr has remained stable in all but 2 patients. These 2 patients, both with a pre-op Cr of 1.5 mg/dL, subsequently developed Cr levels of 2.1 mg/dL and 2.4 mg/dL but maintained baseline Cr levels for 25 and 34 months, respectively, before demonstrating these elevated levels which have proven to be unrelated to renal vein ligation.

    "abstract": "Recruitment and entrapment of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is important in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. EPC mobilization and differentiation are modulated by stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha/CXCL12), another important chemokine. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that SDF-1alpha and VEGF might act synergistically on EPC-mediated vasculogenesis.\nEPCs were isolated and cultured from human peripheral blood, then transduced with retroviral vectors pBabe containing human VEGF(165) complimentary DNA (Td/V-EPCs) and pBabe wild-type (Td/p-EPCs). EPC migration activity was investigated with a modified Boyden chamber assay. EPC apoptosis induced by serum starvation was studied by annexin V assays. The combined effect of local administration of SDF-1alpha and Td/V-EPC transplantation on neovascularization was investigated in a murine model of hind limb ischemia.\nOver-expression of hVEGF(165) increased SDF-1alpha-mediated EPC migration. SDF-1alpha-mediated migration was significantly increased when EPCs were modified with VEGF (Td/V-EPCs) vs when VEGF was not present (Td/p-EPCs) or when VEGF alone was present (Td/V-EPCs; 196.8 +/- 15.2, 81.2 +/- 9.8, and 67.4 +/- 7.4/mm(2), respectively P < .001). SDF-1alpha combined with VEGF reduced serum starvation-induced apoptosis of EPCs more than SDF-1alpha or VEGF alone (P < .001). To determine the effect of this combination in vivo, SDF-1alpha was locally injected alone into the ischemic hind limb muscle of nude mice or combined with systemically injected Td/V-EPCs. The SDF-1alpha plus VEGF group showed significantly increased local accumulation of EPCs, blood-flow recovery, and capillary density compared with the other groups. The ratio of ischemic/normal blood flow in Td/V-EPCs plus SDF-1alpha group was significantly higher (P < .01), as was capillary density (capillaries/mm(2)), an index of neovascularization (Td/V-EPCs plus SDF-1alpha group, 863 +/- 31; no treatment, 395 +/-13; SDF-1alpha, 520 +/- 29; Td/p-EPCs, 448 +/- 28; Td/p-EPCs plus SDF-1alpha, 620 +/- 29; Td/V-EPCs, 570 +/- 30; P < .01). To investigate a possible mechanistic basis, we showed that VEGF up-regulated the receptor for SDF-1alpha, CXCR4, on EPCs in vitro.\nThe combination of SDF-1alpha and VEGF greatly increases EPC-mediated angiogenesis. The use VEGF and SDF-1alpha together, rather than alone, will be a novel and efficient angiogenesis strategy to provide therapeutic neovascularization.",

    "abstract": "Successful outcome after lower extremity revascularization is usually measured by physician-oriented terms such as graft patency and amputation-free survival. It has been increasingly appreciated that these criteria do not necessarily translate into success from the prospective of the patient. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to retrospectively examine success after lower extremity revascularization for tissue loss using patient-oriented measures and to include patients who underwent both open surgical bypass and endovascular therapy.\nBetween 1998 and 2005, 677 patients (316 endovascular and 361 open surgery) underwent revascularization for ischemic tissue loss. The method of revascularization (endovascular or open surgery) was left to the discretion of the surgeon. Revascularization was considered to be clinically successful if each of the following occurred: reconstruction patency until wound healing, limb salvage for 1 year, maintenance of ambulation for 1 year, and survival for 6 months. The influence of 20 intrinsic patient factors, including type of revascularization (open vs endo) was examined using the chi(2) test. Significant factors in bivariate analysis were included in a logistic regression model to determine independent predictors and probability of failure.\nOverall clinical success was achieved in 277 (40.9%) patients. Success for open surgical and endovascular cohorts was 44.3% and 37.0%, respectively (P = .06). Type of intervention was not a significant factor in either bivariate or logistic regression analysis. Independent predictors of failure (odds ratio [OR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) regardless of treatment type included impaired ambulatory status at the time of presentation (OR 3.24; CI 2.14, 4.90), diabetes (OR 1.62; CI 1.14, 2.32), endstage renal disease (ESRD) (OR 1.55; CI 1.07, 2.23), presence of gangrene (OR 2.0; CI 1.42, 2.82), and prior vascular intervention (OR 1.46; CI 1.02, 2.10). Paradoxically, hyperlipidemia (OR 0.70; CI 0.50, 0.98) was a predictor for success. Probability of failure was 35.4% (OR 1.0) if no independent predictors were present and increased with the addition of each adverse predictor. For instance, diabetic patients with impaired ambulatory status and gangrene had an 85.2% (OR 10.5) probability of failure. In the worst case scenario, a diabetic patient with ESRD, impaired ambulatory status, gangrene, and a prior vascular intervention was considered, probability of failure was a dismal 92.8% (OR 23.7).\nClinical success after lower extremity revascularization for ischemic tissue loss is determined by intrinsic patient factors and not by method of revascularization. These data reiterate that future investigation efforts should be focused less on the method of revascularization and more on identification of patient cohorts at risk for failure regardless of treatment.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the perioperative (30-day) and long-term outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in elderly patients with severe symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease. Although the efficacy of CEA in preventing stroke in selected patients has been clearly demonstrated, concern has been expressed about the role of CEA in people over 80 years old.\nAn analysis was conducted on a prospectively compiled computerized database of all primary CEAs performed at our institution from 1990 to 2007. Descriptive demographic data, risk factors, surgical details, perioperative strokes and deaths, and other complications were recorded. All patients underwent postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning and clinical follow-up at one, six, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier life-tables. Long-term relative survival after CEA was assessed against age- and gender-matched controls.\nIn all, 1769 CEAs were performed in 1562 patients, 193 of them (207 CEAs; group I) were > or = 80 years old and 1371 were younger (1562 CEAs; group II). All CEA procedures were performed with patients under deep general anesthesia with continuous perioperative EEG monitoring for selective shunting. No strokes or deaths occurred in group I, whereas there were 11 perioperative strokes and three deaths in group II (1%). A complete follow-up (median, 5.2 years) was obtained in 185 elderly patients: no late occlusions or restenoses were detected, while the seven-year freedom from stroke and death were 96.6% and 52.4%, respectively. The relative seven-year survival rate was 99.8%.\nCEA in elderly patients proved safe and effective, with an excellent long-term durability. The long-term relative survival after CEA in elderly patients was better than in an age-and gender-matched population, so the likelihood of living long enough to benefit from CEA is not jeopardized by being very elderly.",

In most cases, aneurysms are caused by infection, arteritides, collagen vascular disease, vascular malformations, or trauma. We report the case of an 11-year-old girl with an idiopathic and symptomatic left common iliac artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was resected and replaced by a reversed femoral vein. Because the external iliac artery was atrophied, an additional bypass with a reversed great saphenous vein was made. In the postoperative work-up, no etiologic cause could be found for the development of the aneurysm. The symptoms immediately subsided after the operation.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous splanchnic dissection (SSD) occurs infrequently and has a poorly defined natural history. Few studies address the application, timing, and consequences of therapeutic options. Our goal was to apply conservative (non-operative) management in the care of each patient, reserving interventions for specific indications that may be predictive of adverse outcomes.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, 10 consecutive patients (mean age 54.7-years-old, 70.0% male) presented with 11 SSDs involving either the celiac artery (n = 6), superior mesenteric artery (n = 3), or both (n = 1). Each patient had acute, spontaneous onset of persistent abdominal pain and was diagnosed with SSD following multidetector row computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Non-operative management (anticoagulation, anti-impulse therapy, analgesics, and serial CTA examinations) was initially used in 9 patients. Endovascular (n = 2) or operative (n = 2) intervention was performed either immediately (n = 1) or following failed medical management (n = 3) in 4 patients for specific indications that included persistent symptoms (n = 3), expansion of false lumen (n = 3), and/or radiologic malperfusion (n = 3).\nAll patients were asymptomatic after successful non-operative management or following intervention. No morbidity occurred. Upon complete follow-up (mean 13.4 months, range, 2 to 36 months), all patients remained asymptomatic. Preservation of distal perfusion with either thrombosis or ongoing regression of false lumen was achieved in 5 patients who received only non-operative management and in 4 patients following intervention. A stable chronic dissection was present in 1 patient who had only non-operative management.\nSuccessful outcomes following SSD may be achieved with either non-operative therapy alone or intervention if persistent symptoms, expansion of false lumen, and/or malperfusion occur. The unpredictable response of the false lumen to conservative management mandates close, long-term follow-up. Endovascular and operative interventions produced similar outcomes in a small number of patients with limited follow-up. Although SSD is currently perceived as rare, the increasing use of CTA may prove that the true incidence has been underestimated.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the number of endovascular procedures performed on the superficial femoral (SFA) and popliteal arteries (PA) has significantly increased. There is no consensus on the optimal form of intervention used in this arterial segment. While some have advocated balloon angioplasty alone, others have championed either selective or primary stenting of these lesions. It is the purpose of this study to determine the efficacy and durability of primary stenting of the superficial femoral and popliteal artery.\nAll patients undergoing peripheral angioplasty by a single vascular surgeon were prospectively enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved, primary-stenting protocol. During a 44-month period, all patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SFA or PA also received primary arterial stenting with bare, self-expanding nitinol stents. Patient demographics and risk factors were identified. TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) classifications were determined for all lesions. Loss of primary patency was said to have occurred when an occlusion or a 50% or greater stenosis in any treated arterial segment was diagnosed by arterial duplex or angiography. Only time to loss of primary patency was recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and differences between groups tested by log rank method.\nBetween January 16, 2004 and August 13, 2007, 201 angioplasties with primary stenting were performed on 161 patients. One hundred twenty-three stents were placed for claudication, and 78 for critical limb ischemia. Forty-six segments treated were TASC A, 82 were TASC B, 38 were TASC C, and 35 were TASC D. Patient follow-up ranged from three to 1329 days (mean: 426 days). Primary patency rates for TASC A and B lesions were 79%, 67%, and 57% at 12, 24, and 36 months. For TASC C and D lesions, primary patency rates were 52.7%, 36%, and 19% at the same time intervals. Primary patency rates for TASC A and B lesions were significantly higher than for C and D lesions (P < .001). The limb salvage rate was 88.5% in patients with critical limb ischemia. Distal runoff did not influence patency (P = .827).\nPrimary stenting of the SFA and PA provides durable results in patients with TASC A and B lesions and may be an effective treatment strategy. This approach is significantly less effective when used in treating those with TASC C and D disease.

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is not uncommon, but in most patients the object passes without sequelae. In very few patients, the ingested foreign objects may perforate the gastrointestinal tract, causing potentially life-threatening complications. Pointed ingested objects such as toothpicks are the most common. Vascular perforation due to toothpick ingestion has rarely been reported. We present a patient with lower gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to simultaneous perforation of the sigmoid colon and the right iliac limb of an aortobiiliac endograft by an ingested toothpick. This arterioenteric fistula was treated in two stages. First as a bridging operation, a stent graft was inserted into the ipsilateral limb of the previous aortoiliac endograft to control the bleeding. Second, the aortoiliac endograft was removed, the aorta was oversewn, and an extra-anatomic axillobifemoral bypass restored the flow to the lower limbs. The colon perforation was treated with a proximal temporary loop colostomy. To our knowledge, this the first case of aortoiliac endograft-enteric fistula after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair caused by this extraordinary mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous ethanol sclerotherapy (PES) is the primary tool in the treatment of venous malformations (VM). However, PES has known serious complications. This study is aimed at identifying predictors of good response to PES in patients with VM to improve patient selection.\nWe performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study of 158 VM patients (mean age, 14.3 years, male 42%) who underwent ethanol sclerotherapy at a specialized vascular malformation center. For clinical result assessment, patients or parents in pediatric patients answered questions on symptomatic, functional, and cosmetic improvement after PES. In each category, the possible choices were markedly improved, moderately improved, no change, moderately worse, or markedly worse compared with pretreatment status. A \"good response\" was defined as one or more areas of marked improvement on the self-assessment in conjunction with marked improvement on post-treatment images (> or =30% decrease in maximal diameter of VM on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or > or =50% decrease in abnormal blood pool ratio on whole body blood pool scintigraphy [WBBPS] compared with pretreatment images). To determine predictors of a good response to PES, uni- and multivariate analysis were conducted on demographics (age, gender), clinical features of VM (location, size, depth of involved tissue, presence of associated lymphatic malformation, MRI findings; well-defined vs ill-defined margin, characteristics of venous drainage during PES) and treatment variables (number of PES sessions, maximal concentration and dosage of ethanol used in PES, adjuvant therapy).\nSymptomatic, functional, and cosmetic improvement was 28%, 27%, and 34%, respectively, based on patient questionnaires. Based on imaging studies, 42 patients (27%) had markedly improvement. Composite outcome combining questionnaire results and imaging study showed that 16% of patients had a \"good response\". On multivariate analysis, female gender (odds ratio [OR]: 4.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-16.28), no or delayed visualization of drainage vein (OR: 9.22, 95% CI: 1.79-47.51), and a well-defined margin on MRI (OR: 13.38, 95% CI: 2.84-63.12) were independent predictors of \"good response\" to PES.\nPES should be performed in selected patients in order to obtain the best outcomes and minimize complications. No or delayed visualization of drainage vein on initial direct puncture venogram, a well-defined margin on MRI, and female gender were statistically significant predictors of a \"good response\" to PES and may be useful in selecting patients.",

    "abstract": "The role of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in the management of acute type B aortic dissection remains undefined. Entry tear coverage during the acute phase is an appealing method to treat acute complications, and by inducing false lumen thrombosis, might also prevent late aneurysm formation. This study evaluated structural changes by serial computed tomography (CT) in the thoracic aorta after TEVAR performed for acute complicated aortic dissection.\nBetween August 2005 and October 2007, 33 patients with complicated acute type B aortic dissection were treated with TEVAR (19 from a prospective industry sponsored trial, 14 from our institution). CT images obtained preprocedurally (PP), at 1 month (1M), and 1 year (1Y) were evaluated for each patient. Four patients with no postprocedural imaging were excluded. The largest diameters of the thoracic aorta, dissection true lumen, and false lumen were recorded at each time point. Changes in total aortic and true and false lumen diameters were evaluated using a mixed effect analysis of variance model of repeated measures.\nThe average age was 58 years (range, 38-87 years); 26 (81%) were male. Indications for TEVAR included malperfusion syndrome in 17 (53%), refractory hypertension in 14 (44%), impending rupture in 12 (28%), and refractory pain in 14 (44%); 19 (59%) had more than one indication. The average length of aorta covered was 19.5 cm (range, 10-29.3 cm). The maximum aortic diameter decreased over time (P = .04) and averaged 39.9 (PP), 41.3 (1M), and 34.8 mm (1Y). The true lumen diameter increased over time (P = .02) and averaged 23.7 (PP), 29.0 (1M), and 31.1 mm (1Y). The false lumen diameter decreased (P = .046) and averaged 19.5 (PP), 12.1 (1M), and 9.6 mm (1Y). Partial or complete thrombosis of the false lumen along the stented segment of aorta was recorded in 87% (PP), 93% (1M), and 88% (1Y).\nTEVAR of acute complicated aortic dissection appears to promote early aortic remodeling. Nearly 90% of patients maintained at least partial false lumen thrombosis at 1 year. Because continued false lumen patency correlates strongly with late aneurysm formation, such favorable remodeling is considered a surrogate for prevention of late aneurysm, but longer follow-up is required.",

    "abstract": "To compare the proportion and rate of healing, pain, and quality of life of low-strength medical compression stockings (MCS) with traditional bandages applied for the treatment of recalcitrant venous leg ulcers.\nA single-center, randomized, open-label study was performed with consecutive patients. Sigvaris prototype MCS providing 15 mm Hg-25 mm Hg at the ankle were compared with multi-layer short-stretch bandages. In both groups, pads were placed above incompetent perforating veins in the ulcer area. The initial static pressure between the dressing-covered ulcer and the pad was 29 mm Hg and 49 mm Hg with MCS and bandages, respectively. Dynamic pressure measurements showed no difference. Compression was maintained day and night and changed every week. The primary endpoint was healing within 90 days. Secondary endpoints were healing within 180 days, time to healing, pain (weekly Likert scales), and monthly quality of life (ChronIc Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life [CIVIQ] questionnaire).\nOf 74 patients screened, 60 fulfilled the selection criteria and 55 completed the study; 28 in the MCS and 27 in the bandage group. Ulcers were recurrent (48%), long lasting (mean, 27 months), and large (mean, 13 cm2). All but one patient had deep venous reflux and/or incompetent perforating veins in addition to trunk varices. Characteristics of patients and ulcers were evenly distributed (exception: more edema in the MCS group; P = .019). Healing within 90 days was observed in 36% with MCS and in 48% with bandages (P = .350). Healing within 180 days was documented in 50% with MCS and in 67% with bandages (P = .210). Time to healing was identical. Pain scored 44 and 46 initially (on a scale in which 100 referred to maximum and 0 to no pain) and decreased within the first week to 20 and 28 in the MCS and bandage groups, respectively (P < .001 vs .010). Quality of life showed no difference between the treatment groups. In both groups, pain at 90 days had decreased by half, independent of completion of healing. Physical, social, and psychic impairment improved significantly in patients with healed ulcers only.\nOur study illustrates the difficulty of bringing large and long-standing venous ulcers to heal. The effect of compression with MCS was not different from that of compression with bandages. Both treatments alleviated pain promptly. Quality of life was improved only in patients whose ulcers had healed.",

    "abstract": "Open repair of acute traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta has been the standard of care for the past half century. Traditional criteria of operative success have been patient survival and prevention of spinal cord ischemia. Historical series have reported a variability of surgical results with relation to the variety of operative approaches. This study aims to update the results obtained with a uniform surgical technique based on a systematic utilization of distal perfusion during aortic cross-clamping.\nDuring a 35-year period (1974-2009), 138 consecutive patients with an acute traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta were repaired with a Dacron graft interposition through a standard left thoracotomy. All patients received a method of circulatory support. A passive 9-mm Gott shunt inserted between the ascending and the descending aorta and delivering a median flow of 3 L/min was used in the first 40 cases. A partial left heart bypass realized from the left atrium to the descending aorta and driven with a centrifugal pump was used in the last 98 consecutive cases. A median flow of 4 L/min was recorded. Mean age of the patients was 27 years and 90.6% of them had associated injuries for a calculated mean ISS of 44.\nTwo outcome variables were analyzed: hospital mortality and postoperative spinal cord ischemic injury. Overall hospital mortality is 5% (7/138 patients). This was improved from 7.5% (3/40) in patients perfused with the Gott shunt to 4% (4/98) in patients protected with the left heart bypass and lowered to 1.5% (1/68) in the last 68 patients. Among 134 cases with an intact preoperative spinal cord, one patient (0.7%) developed a new paraplegia due to a nonfunctional Gott shunt. Among 98 patients perfused with a centrifugal pump-driven left heart bypass, none of the 97 patients (0%) with a preoperative intact spinal cord developed a spinal cord ischemic deficit.\nConventional open surgical repair of acute traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta performed with an orderly monitored circulatory support can be accomplished with a very low rate of mortality and spinal cord injury. Compared with the Gott shunt, a left heart bypass propelled with a centrifugal pump is technically a more versatile method of perfusion, and it provides higher hemodynamic performance.",

    "abstract": "In situ fenestration of aortic stent grafts has the potential to allow for continued perfusion of supra-aortic trunks, without the need for extra-anatomic bypass, and without the need for custom-made devices. Angulation of the target vessel relative to the arch is an obstacle to success with this technique. In this report, we describe a case of successful in situ fenestration of the left subclavian artery (LSA) in a patient with an aortic arch aneurysm, treated with an endovascular stent graft. We outline a novel technique using through and through wire access and a pre-curved semi-rigid sheath, which allows successful access to the lumen of the aortic stent graft, despite an acute angle at the take-off of the LSA.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between the orientation of the iliac arteries in infrarenal aortic aneurysms and its effect on the cannulation of the contralateral limb of a bifurcated stent graft system (SGS) used for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThis is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data in 100 consecutive patients treated with EVAR using the Zenith device (Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, Indiana, USA). We collected data on reciprocal orientation between the origins of the common iliac arteries (OOCIA) on an axial plane, the common femoral artery (right or left) used to deliver the main body of the SGS (access side), and the cannulation time of the contralateral limb. The latter was defined as the time elapsed between the introduction of the selective catheter in the contralateral iliac artery to the time of successful cannulation of the contralateral limb of the SGS. Using an Aquarius workstation (v. 3.5; TeraRecon Inc, San Mateo, Calif), the OOCIA was measured establishing the center of the origin of the right and left common iliac arteries and joining them using a straight line. A horizontal line was then drawn through the origin of the right common iliac artery. The angle created by these two lines was defined as \"zero,\" \"positive,\" or \"negative.\" We examined the relations between cannulation time, access side, and OOCIA using t tests and a multivariate regression analysis.\nIn 84 patients, the origin of the right common iliac artery was in an anterior position compared with the left; in 16, the origin of the right and left were on the same horizontal line; and the right common iliac artery was posterior in none of the patients. The main body of the prosthesis was delivered using the left femoral artery in 52 patients and the right in 48. When all patients were considered, cannulation time was shorter when the main body of the bifurcated prosthesis was delivered through the left femoral artery (9.3 +/- 5.8 minutes vs 15.4 +/- 7.2 minutes, P < .0001). This effect was more pronounced when only patients with the left common iliac artery located posteriorly were examined (9.3 +/- 5.80 minutes vs 16.4 +/- 7.6 minutes, P < .0001). There was no correlation between increasing negativity of the OOCIA angle and cannulation time, regardless of access side.\nWe have shown that in patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms, the origin of the right iliac artery is often anterior compared with the left and that cannulation time of the contralateral limb is shorter when the main body of the prosthesis is delivered from the left.",

    "abstract": "The goals of this study were to determine if endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) affects both early and late collateral arterial adaptation and blood flow recovery after severe limb ischemia in a mouse model and to determine if eNOS-derived NO is necessary for recruitment of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)(+) vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1)(+) hemangiocytes to the site of ischemia.\nTwo studies were completed. In the first, hind limb ischemia was induced by unilateral femoral artery excision in three groups: C57Bl6 (wild-type), eNOS(-/-), and C57Bl/6 mice treated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) from 1 day before excision through day 3 after excision (early L-NAME group). These groups were studied on day 3 after induction of ischemia. In the second study, hind limb ischemia was induced in C57Bl/6 mice (wild-type) and C57Bl/6 mice treated with L-NAME from days 3 through 28 after induction of ischemia. These groups were studied day 28 after ischemia induction. Dependent variables included hind limb perfusion, collateral artery diameter, and the number and location of hemangiocytes within the ischemic hind limb.\nIn the first study, toe gangrene developed in the eNOS(-/-) and early L-NAME treatment groups by day 2. These groups demonstrated less blood flow recovery and smaller collateral artery diameter than the wild-type group. Hemangiocytes were present within the adventitia of collateral arteries in the wild-type group but were only sparsely present, in a random pattern, in the eNOS(-/-) and early L-NAME treatment groups. In the second study, the late L-NAME group showed less blood flow recovery and smaller collateral artery diameter on day 28 of ischemia than the wild-type group. Hemangiocytes were present in a pericapillary distribution in the wild-type group, but were present only sparsely in the late L-NAME treatment group.\nEarly (day 3) and late (day 28) adaptive responses to hind limb ischemia both require eNOS-derived NO. NO is necessary for normal hemangiocyte recruitment to the ischemic tissue.",

    "abstract": "Severe stenosis of the common carotid artery (CCA), while uncommon, is associated with increased risk of transient ischemic attack and stroke. To date, no validated duplex ultrasound criteria have been established for grading the severity of CCA stenosis. The goal of this study was to use receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis with computed tomographic angiography as the reference standard to establish duplex ultrasound criteria for diagnosing >or=50% CCA stenosis.\nThe study cohort included 64 patients (42 men, 22 women) with a mean age of 65 +/- 12 years (range, 16-89 years) who had CCA peak systolic velocity (PSV) >or=150 cm/sec and underwent computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the cervical and intracerebral vessels within 1 month of the duplex examination. One study was excluded because the CTA was technically inadequate, whereas another was excluded because the patient underwent bilateral CCA stenting. The CCA ipsilateral to any of the following was excluded from the analysis: innominate artery occlusion (n = 1), previous stenting of the ICA or CCA (n = 7), carotid endarterectomy (n = 1), or carotid-to-carotid bypass (n = 1). Thus, the data set included 62 patients and 115 vessels. Bland-Altman analysis was used to examine the agreement between two measures of luminal reduction measured by CTA: percent diameter stenosis and percent area stenosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal PSV and EDV thresholds for diagnosing >or=50% CCA stenosis.\nSeverity of CCA stenosis was <50% in 76 vessels, 50%-59% in eight, 60%-69% in eight, 70%-79% in nine, 80%-89% in three, 90%-99% in five, and occluded in six. Duplex ultrasonography identified six of six (100%) patients with 100% CCA occlusion by CTA. Bland-Altman analysis showed poor agreement between percent stenosis determined by vessel diameter compared with percent stenosis determined by reduction in lumen area. Therefore, subsequent analysis was performed using percent stenosis by area. ROC analysis of different PSV thresholds for detecting stenosis >or=50% showed that >182 cm/sec was the most accurate with a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 88% (P < .0001). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of carotid duplex were higher when the stenosis was located in the mid or distal aspects of the CCA (sensitivity 76%, specificity 89%, area under curve 0.84, P < .001) than in the intrathoracic and proximal segment of the artery (P = NS). ROC analysis of different EDV thresholds for detecting CCA stenosis >or=50% showed that >30 cm/sec was the most accurate with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 74% (P < .0239).\nDuplex ultrasonography is highly sensitive, specific, and accurate for detecting CCA lesions in the mid and distal CCA. Use of peak systolic velocity may lead to improved detection of CCA disease and initiation of appropriate therapy to reduce the risk of stroke.",

    "results": "Severity of CCA stenosis was <50% in 76 vessels, 50%-59% in eight, 60%-69% in eight, 70%-79% in nine, 80%-89% in three, 90%-99% in five, and occluded in six. Duplex ultrasonography identified six of six (100%) patients with 100% CCA occlusion by CTA. Bland-Altman analysis showed poor agreement between percent stenosis determined by vessel diameter compared with percent stenosis determined by reduction in lumen area. Therefore, subsequent analysis was performed using percent stenosis by area. ROC analysis of different PSV thresholds for detecting stenosis >or=50% showed that >182 cm/sec was the most accurate with a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 88% (P < .0001). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of carotid duplex were higher when the stenosis was located in the mid or distal aspects of the CCA (sensitivity 76%, specificity 89%, area under curve 0.84, P < .001) than in the intrathoracic and proximal segment of the artery (P = NS). ROC analysis of different EDV thresholds for detecting CCA stenosis >or=50% showed that >30 cm/sec was the most accurate with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 74% (P < .0239).",

    "abstract": "Although carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy in cerebral revascularization, restenosis remains an unsolved issue. Cilostazol is a unique antiplatelet drug that has vasodilatory effects and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. We investigated whether cilostazol reduces restenosis after CAS.\nA database of 113 consecutive CAS procedures between April 2002 and December 2007 was assessed retrospectively. All patients received aspirin (100 mg/d) and another antiplatelet drug such as cilostazol (200 mg/d), ticlopidine (200 mg/d), or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) at least 3 days before CAS. Two antiplatelet drugs were continued for 2 to 3 months after CAS and reduced to one thereafter. Patients were evaluated at 3 and 6 months and at 6-month intervals thereafter with duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging. Angiography was used for confirmation when stenosis was suspected as >50% with DUS imaging.\nWe were able to monitor 97 patients for a 12-month period. The overall combined rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death was 3.1% at 30 days and 4.1% at 1 year. In-stent recurrent stenosis was documented in 11 patients (11%); in 10 patients (9.7%), this occurred <or=12 months of CAS. In-stent restenosis was significantly reduced in the cilostazol (+) group (0% vs 15.7% [11 of 70], P = .03). Patient characteristics were similar between the cilostazol (+) and cilostazol (-) groups.\nAlthough this study was retrospective and nonrandomized, the results suggest that cilostazol administration improves long-term patency after CAS due to its inhibitory effect on smooth muscle cell growth.",

    "abstract": "There has been debate regarding the safety of performing elective procedures in patients with vascular manifestations associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The purpose of this study was to review the surgical management and clinical outcomes of EDS patients undergoing vascular procedures at a tertiary medical center with multimodality expertise in connective tissue disorders.\nAll patients with EDS undergoing endovascular and open vascular procedures at a single-institution academic medical center from 1994 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data were evaluated including patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), and mortality outcomes during hospital course and long-term follow-up.\nA total of 40 patients with EDS were identified, including individuals diagnosed with classic (n = 15), hypermobility (n = 16), and vascular (n = 9) types of EDS. These patients collectively underwent 45 endovascular and 18 open procedures for vascular disease during the time period, including embolization (n = 37), angioplasty (n = 8), arterial bypass (n = 5), and aortic aneurysm repair (n = 13). All cases were performed electively, except for one (2%) urgent endovascular and one (5%) emergent open procedure. Endovascular procedures were associated with a median LOS (interquartile range [IQR]) of 2 (1 to 3) days with no procedure-related mortality or in-hospital deaths among all EDS types, whereas open vascular procedures had median LOS (IQR) of 6 (5 to 8) days with one (6%) in-hospital death occurring in a vascular EDS patient. Survival free of any complication at 5 years was 85% and 54% following endovascular and open procedures, respectively.\nThe elective surgical management of vascular disorders in EDS patients using open and endovascular procedures has been associated with good outcomes. Our results suggest that vascular interventions in these EDS patients can be safely performed and should not be withheld until rupture or acute symptoms arise.",

    "abstract": "Catheter-associated upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (CAUEDVT) is well known; however, resolution rates and factors affecting resolution of CAUEDVT are not well characterized. This study determined resolution rates and factors associated with resolution of CAUEDVT.\nFrom January 1, 2002, to June 30, 2006, 1761 upper extremity venous duplex ultrasound (DU) studies were performed, and a new UEDVT was found in 253 (14.4%). Of these, 150 patients had routine follow-up and 101 had CAUEDVT. Demographics, follow-up DU results, and risk factors for venous thrombosis were recorded in the patients with follow-up studies and CAUEDVT. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for complete thrombus resolution.\nThere were 49 men (49%) and 52 women (51%) with CAUEDVT and follow-up studies. Mean age was 49 years (range, 5 months-80 years). Patients with CAUEDVT had risk factors for venous thrombosis that included malignancy in 34%, recent surgery/trauma in 34%, known hypercoagulable state in 11%, concomitant lower extremity DVT in 21%, and pulmonary embolism in 5%. Complete resolution of DVT on follow-up was documented in 46%. Thrombosis resolved in only 25% (6 of 24) when the catheter was not removed (P <or= .05). Anticoagulation did not improve the rate of thrombus resolution (P <or= 1.0) compared with catheter removal alone. Of the patients who had thrombus resolution, 75% resolved by 100 days (range, 1-914 days) after catheter removal <or=48 hours of diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, only catheter removal predicted the likelihood of thrombus resolution (odds ratio, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-9.09; P = .025). New-site UEDVT developed in 86% of patients with CAUEDVT who underwent catheter removal and immediate catheter placement in a new site. Pulmonary embolism developed in five patients with CAUEDVT. Of these, three had documented lower extremity DVT as well. No pulmonary emboli were fatal.\nMore than half of CAUEDVT resolve <or=113 days when the catheter is removed <or=48 hours of diagnosis. New-site catheter placement has a high rate of new associated UEDVT. Anticoagulation does not appear to augment resolution of UEDVT.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing repair of thoracoabdominal (TAA) or visceral aortic segment aneurysms typically require reconstruction of the renal arteries. The use of balloon expandable stents (BES) has been proposed as an alternative to endarterectomy or bypass for renal artery reconstruction (RAR) during open aortic aneurysm repair. We report technical aspects and long-term patency data for this method of right RAR during complex open aortic aneurysm repair.\nDuring the interval July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007, a total of 67 patients underwent right RAR using a BES during concomitant TAA (type I: n = 2 [2.9%], type II: n = 8 [11.9%], type III: n = 13 [19.4%], and type IV: n = 22 [32.8%]), juxtarenal (n = 9 [13.4%]) or suprarenal (n = 13 [19.4%]) AAA repair. Indications for RAR were orificial stenosis (n = 21 [31%]) and/or technical considerations referable to the proximal aortic suture line. Patency of the renal stent was evaluated in patients with computed tomography angiography using three-dimensional reconstruction or with abdominal duplex evaluation at follow-up.\nThe mean patient age was 75.1 years, 54.4% were male, and 18% of operations were in nonelective circumstances. Twenty-seven (39%) out of 67 patients had a preoperative creatinine level > or = 1.4 mg/dL. Two patients (2.9%) developed permanent renal failure postoperatively (neither related to renal artery occlusion). Mean radiologic follow-up was 405 days (11-1281) with 98% stent patency noted. One patient had an early stent occlusion noted at 1 month. An additional patient was noted to have a nonflow-limiting dissection distal to the renal stent, and another was noted to have distal migration of the stent beyond the renal ostium; however, these findings were clinically silent.\nThe use of BES during complex open aortic aneurysm repair affords a rapid and durable mode of RAR, obviating the need for endarterectomy and its associated technical complications.",

    "abstract": "Renal failure after thoracoabdominal aortic repair is a significant clinical problem. Distal aortic perfusion for organ and spinal cord protection requires cannulation of the left femoral artery. In 2006, we reported the finding that direct cannulation led to leg ischemia in some patients and was associated with increased renal failure. After this finding, we modified our perfusion technique to eliminate leg ischemia from cannulation. In this article, we present the effects of this change on postoperative renal function.\nBetween February 1991 and July 2008, we repaired 1464 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Distal aortic perfusion was used in 1088, and these were studied. Median patient age was 68 years, and 378 (35%) were women. In September 2006, we began to adopt a sidearm femoral cannulation technique that provides distal aortic perfusion while maintaining downstream flow to the leg. This was used in 167 patients (15%). We measured the joint effects of preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and cannulation technique on the highest postoperative creatinine level, postoperative renal failure, and death. Analysis was by multiple linear or logistic regression with interaction.\nThe preoperative GFR was the strongest predictor of postoperative renal dysfunction and death. No significant main effects of sidearm cannulation were noted. For peak creatinine level and postoperative renal failure, however, strong interactions between preoperative GFR and sidearm cannulation were present, resulting in reductions of postoperative renal complications of 15% to 20% when GFR was <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). For normal GFR, the effect was negated or even reversed at very high levels of GFR. Mortality, although not significantly affected by sidearm cannulation, showed a similar trend to the renal outcomes.\nUse of sidearm cannulation is associated with a clinically important and highly statistically significant reduction in postoperative renal complications in patients with a low GFR. Reduced renal effect of skeletal muscle ischemia is the proposed mechanism. Effects among patients with good preoperative renal function are less clear. A randomized trial is needed.",

For peak creatinine level and postoperative renal failure, however, strong interactions between preoperative GFR and sidearm cannulation were present, resulting in reductions of postoperative renal complications of 15% to 20% when GFR was <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). For normal GFR, the effect was negated or even reversed at very high levels of GFR. Mortality, although not significantly affected by sidearm cannulation, showed a similar trend to the renal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at high risk of secondary cardiovascular death and events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. To minimize this elevated risk, cardiovascular risk factors should be treated in all PAD patients. Secondary risk management may benefit from a prediction tool to identify PAD patients at the highest risk who could be referred for an additional extensive workup. Stratifying PAD patients according to their risk of secondary events could aid in achieving optimal therapy compliance. To this end we developed a prediction model for secondary cardiovascular events in PAD patients.\nThe model was developed using data from 800 PAD patients who participated in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort study. From the baseline characteristics, 13 candidate predictors were selected for the model development. Missing values were imputed by means of single regression imputation. Continuous predictors were truncated and transformed where necessary, followed by model reduction by means of backward stepwise selection. To correct for over-fitting, a bootstrapping technique was applied. Finally, a score chart was created that divides patients in four risk categories that have been linked to the risk of a cardiovascular event during 1- and 5-year follow-up.\nDuring a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, 120 events occurred (27% nonfatal myocardial infarction, 21% nonfatal stroke, and 52% mortality from vascular causes), corresponding to a 1- and 5-year cumulative incidence of 3.1% and 13.2%, respectively. Important predictors for the secondary risk of a cardiovascular event are age, history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking behavior, ankle-brachial pressure index, and creatinine level. The risk of a cardiovascular event in a patient as predicted by the model was 0% to 10% and 1% to 28% for the four risk categories at 1- and 5-year follow-up, respectively. The discriminating capacity of the prediction model, indicated by the c statistic, was 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.80).\nA prediction model can be used to predict secondary cardiovascular risk in PAD patients. We propose such a prediction model to allow for the identification of PAD patients at the highest risk of a cardiovascular event or cardiovascular death, which may be a viable tool in vascular secondary health care practice.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaque stabilization is a promising strategy to prevent cerebrovascular events in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Vascular calcification inhibitors, known osteopontin (OPN) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), have emerged as novel cardiovascular biomarkers. This open-label, prospective study aimed to examine whether aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin is more effective than moderate lipid-lowering in increasing carotid plaque echogenicity, assessed by Gray-Scale Median (GSM) score and suppressing serum OPN and OPG levels in patients with moderate carotid stenosis.\nOne hundred forty patients (64 males, 76 females), aged 50 to 75 years, with carotid stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET]: 30%-60% for symptomatic and 30%-70% for asymptomatic), but without indications for surgical intervention, were enrolled. Patients with coronary heart disease, renal failure, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and ongoing use of statins were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to: Group A (N = 70): Moderate lipid-lowering therapy with low-dose of atorvastatin (10 mg-20 mg) to target LDL-C <100 mg/dL. Group B (N = 70): Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with high-dose of atorvastatin (80 mg) to target LDL-C <70 mg/dL. Blood pressure, lipid and glycemic indexes, hsCRP, serum OPN, and OPG were measured at baseline and after 12 months as well as the GSM score. Independent samples t test, paired samples t test, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used (P < .05).\nThere were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Three patients in group A experienced either cerebrovascular or cardiac ischemic attacks, while two patients in group B underwent coronary angioplasty during follow-up. Group B showed a more pronounced improvement in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared with group A (P < .05). Moreover, atorvastatin treatment suppressed serum hsCRP, OPN, and OPG levels from baseline in both groups (P < .001). Notably, aggressive treatment decreased OPN (P = .012) and OPG (P = .025) levels to a greater degree compared with moderate treatment. Similarly, GSM score was remarkably increased in both groups, but that augmentation was greater in group B (from 66.39 +/- 23.66 to 100.4 +/- 25.31) than in group A (from 64.4 +/- 23.62 to 85.39 +/- 20.21) (P = .024). No change in the degree of carotid stenosis was noted in both treatment arms. Importantly, the aforementioned reduction in OPN (r = -0.517, P = .024) and OPG (r = -0.312, P = .008) levels was inversely associated with GSM score changes in univariate and standard multiple regression analysis (R(2) = 0.411, P = .021).\nAmong patients with moderate carotid stenosis, an aggressive atorvastatin regimen enhanced carotid plaque echogenicity and reduced serum OPN and OPG levels to a greater extent than respective moderate atorvastatin therapy. Most importantly, those atorvastatin-induced effects were associated with OPN and OPG suppression in a dose-dependent manner.",

We tested the hypothesis that type 2 diabetic mice have a greater reduction in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, a greater increase in oxidative stress, and reduced arteriogenesis and angiogenesis, resulting in less complete blood flow recovery than type 1 diabetic mice after induction of hind limb ischemia.\nHind limb ischemia was generated by femoral artery excision in streptozotocin-treated mice (model of type 1 diabetes), in Lepr(db/db) mice (model of type 2 diabetes), and in control (C57BL/6) mice. Dependent variables included eNOS expression and markers of arteriogenesis, angiogenesis, and oxidative stress.\nPostischemia recovery of hind limb perfusion was significantly less in type 2 than in type 1 diabetic mice; however, neither group demonstrated a significant increase in collateral artery diameter or collateral artery angioscore in the ischemic hind limb. The capillary/myofiber ratio in the gastrocnemius muscle decreased in response to ischemia in control or type 1 diabetic mice but remained the same in type 2 diabetic mice. Gastrocnemius muscle eNOS expression was lower in type 1 and 2 diabetic mice than in control mice. This expression decreased after induction of ischemia in type 2 but not in type 1 diabetic mice. The percentage of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in the peripheral blood failed to increase in either diabetic group after induction of ischemia, whereas this variable significantly increased in the control group in response to ischemia. EPC eNOS expression decreased after induction of ischemia in type 1 but not in type 2 diabetic mice.

    "abstract": "Varicose veins are common and increasingly are being treated by less invasive endoscopic methods such as foam sclerotherapy. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is also common, present in approximately one-quarter of adults. PFO allows bubbles introduced by foam sclerotherapy to cross into the general circulation, potentially causing cerebral artery gas embolization with unevaluated consequences.\nMen and women aged 18 to 60 years with symptomatic varicose veins (CEAP C(3-5)) responded to an advertisement to recruit volunteers for a study on endovenous microfoam ablation (EMA). Participants' veins were screened by duplex ultrasound imaging, and those with isolated great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence were tested for right-to-left (R-L) vascular shunt using transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery to detect the presence of bubble emboli after an injection of an agitated saline, blood, and air mixture as a contrast at rest and with the Valsalva maneuver.\nOf 221 participants tested for R-L shunt, 85 (38.5%) were positive at rest (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.5-45.2) and 114 (51.8%) were positive after the Valsalva maneuver (95% CI, 45.4-58.5). A total 130 patients (58.8%) were positive for R-L shunt at rest or after Valsalva (95% CI, 52.5%-65.1%). This is significantly higher than the reported 26% prevalence of PFO in the general population (95% CI, 24.4-30.1).\nThe prevalence of R-L shunt in patients with GSV incompetence CEAP C(3-5) in this study was higher than expected in the general population. TCD does not differentiate between intracardiac shunts and intrapulmonary shunts, so this observation needs further investigation. This link between R-L shunt and varicose veins is novel and, whether etiologic or functional, may improve the understanding of both conditions. The findings have importance in the treatment of varicose veins with foam sclerotherapy and EMA.",

Definitive management consisted of popliteal vein aneurysm resection and reconstruction with an interposition spiral vein graft. Our case suggests that aneurysm vein resection and interposition vein graft should be the preferred surgical option. Also, patients treated may benefit from longer follow-up in light of the potential morbidity from recurrence if undetected.",

    "abstract": "Few options other than amputation exist for some patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) and severe anatomical limitations.\nThis prospective study presents short-term results of dual intramuscular and intra-arterial autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) implantation for the treatment of patients with severe PAD in whom amputation was considered the only viable treatment option. Baseline, two-week, and three-month evaluations were conducted. Ankle brachial indices (ABI) were calculated for both the dorsal pedis and the posterior tibial arteries. Rest pain and ulcer healing also were assessed. Success was defined as meeting the following four criteria: improvement in ABI measurements; relief of rest pain; ulcer healing, if applicable; and absence of major limb amputations. Patients not undergoing major limb amputations continued to be monitored for subsequent procedures.\nNine patients for whom limb amputation was recommended underwent this procedure. The study population was comprised of five females and four males, with a mean age of 61.7 years. Eight (88.9%) patients had rest pain. Seven (77.8%) patients also had diabetes. Non-healing ulcers were present in eight (88.9%) cases. After the procedure, non-significant improvements of 0.12 and 0.08 in ABI were observed for the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial ankle arteries, respectively. Three (33.3%) major amputations subsequently were performed, including a below-knee amputation 4.1 weeks after the BM-MNC implantation and two above-knee amputations at 5.4 and 11.0 weeks after the procedure. The six (66.7%) patients who did not have major amputations demonstrated improvement in symptom severity three months after the procedure, as evidenced by alleviation of rest pain and improvements by at least one level in Rutherford and Fontaine classifications, and have not required amputations at a mean follow-up of 7.8 months. Complete wound healing was achieved within three months in all patients who had ulcers prior to BM-MNC implantation and for whom amputation was not required. This specific BM-MNC implantation technique was fully successful in three (33.3%) patients, as major amputation was avoided and the other applicable criteria were met. Five (55.6%) additional patients demonstrated success in at least one of the four criteria.\nWith eight (88.9%) of nine patients showing some level of improvement and amputation avoided in six (66.7%) patients, these short-term results indicate the use of BM-MNC implantation as a means of limb salvage therapy for patients with severe PAD shows promise in postponing or avoiding amputation in a patient population currently presented with few alternatives to amputation.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (LE PTA) is currently performed by a variety of endovascular specialists. We hypothesized that cardiologists (CRD) and vascular surgeons (VAS) may have different practice patterns, indications for intervention, and hospital resource utilization.\nUsing the State Inpatient Databases for New Jersey (2003-2007), patients with elective admission undergoing PTA procedures with indications of claudication, rest pain, and gangrene/ulceration were examined. Physician specialty was determined based on all procedures performed. We contrasted by specialty, the indication for LE PTA for the procedure, volume, and hospital resource utilization.\nOf the 1887 cases of LE PTA, VAS performed 866 (45.9%) and CRD 1021 (54.1%) procedures. The mean patient age was 68.0 years (CRD) vs 70.7 years (VAS), P = .0163. Indications for intervention were compared for CRD vs VAS: claudication 80.7% vs 60.7%, (P < .002); rest pain 6.2% vs 16.0%, (P < .002); gangrene/ulceration 13.1% vs 23.3%, (P < .002). Stents (64.8% of cases) were utilized similarly among physicians (P = .18), and mean hospital length of stay were similar (2.38 days vs 2.41 days, P = .85). Hospital charges by indication varied between CRD vs VAS (all procedures: $49,748 vs $42,158 [P < .0001]). Revenue center charges were different between CRD vs VAS: medical surgical supply $19,128 vs $12,737, (P < .0001); pharmacy $1,959 vs $1,115, (P < .0001). Only 10.7% of CRD were high volume practitioners, compared with 36.8% among VAS (P < .05). High volume practitioners had significantly lower hospital charges ($41,730 vs $51,014, P < .001).\nCardiologists performing lower extremity angioplasty were more likely to treat patients with claudication than those with rest pain or gangrene/ulceration. Despite treating younger patients with less severe peripheral vascular disease, cardiologists used significantly greater hospital resources. High practitioner volume, regardless of specialty, was associated with lower hospital resource utilization. Reducing variations in indication and practitioner volume may offer substantial cost savings for lower extremity endovascular interventions.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endovascular repair (EVAR) for small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nWe developed a Markov model of a hypothetical 68-year-old cohort to determine the cost-effectiveness of early EVAR for \"small\" AAAs (4.0 cm-5.4 cm) compared with elective repair (open or endovascular) at the traditional cut-off of 5.5 cm. Repair options for 5.5-cm AAAs include both endovascular and open procedures. Probabilities were obtained from the literature. Costs reflected direct costs in 2007 dollars. Outcomes were reported as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).\nThe model demonstrated that early EVAR for 4.0 cm-5.4 cm AAAs led to fewer QALYs at greater costs when compared with observational management with elective repair at 5.5 cm. Sensitivity analyses suggested that early EVAR of 4.6 cm-4.9 cm AAAs can be cost-effective if the long-term mortality rate after EVAR is <or=1.91% per year or if the quality of life after EVAR is improved. Likewise, if the quality of life before repair is low, EVAR for AAAs >or=4.6 cm may be cost-effective. With a >70% probability, observational management until AAA diameter is 5.5 cm will be the cost-effective option.\nThis analysis demonstrated that early EVAR for AAAs <5.5 cm is not likely to be cost-effective compared with elective repair at 5.5 cm.

    "abstract": "Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) results in significant gait impairment. In an attempt to fully delineate and quantify these gait alterations, we analyzed joint kinematics, torques (rotational forces), and powers (rotational forces times angular velocity) in patients with PAD with unilateral claudication for both the affected and nonaffected legs.\nTwelve patients with unilateral PAD (age, 61.69 +/- 10.53 years, ankle-brachial index [ABI]: affected limb 0.59 +/- 0.25; nonaffected limb 0.93 +/- 0.12) and 10 healthy controls (age, 67.23 +/- 12.67 years, ABI >1.0 all subjects) walked over a force platform to acquire gait kinetics, while joint kinematics were recorded simultaneously. Data were collected for the affected and nonaffected limbs during pain free (PAD-PF) and pain induced (PAD-P) trials. Kinetics and kinematics were combined to quantify torque and powers during the stance period from the hip, knee, and ankle joints.\nThe affected limb demonstrated significantly (P <.05) reduced ankle plantar flexion torque compared to controls during late stance in both PAD-PF and PAD-P trials. There were significant reductions in ankle plantar flexion power generation during late stance for both the affected (P <.05) and nonaffected limbs (P <.05) compared to control during PAD-PF and PAD-P trials. No significant differences were noted in torque comparing the nonaffected limbs in PAD-PF and PAD-P conditions to control for knee and hip joints throughout the stance phase. Significant reductions were found in knee power absorption in early stance and knee power generation during mid stance for both limbs of the patients with PAD as compared to control (P <.05).\nPatients with PAD with unilateral claudication demonstrate significant gait impairments in both limbs that are present even before they experience any claudication symptoms. Overall, our data demonstrate significantly reduced ankle plantar flexion torque and power during late stance with reduced knee power during early and mid stance for the affected limb. Further studies are needed to determine if these findings are dependent on the location and the severity of lower extremity ischemia and whether the changes in the nonaffected limb are the result of underlying PAD or compensatory changes from the affected limb dysfunction.",

Significant reductions were found in knee power absorption in early stance and knee power generation during mid stance for both limbs of the patients with PAD as compared to control (P <.05).",

    "abstract": "Occlusion of the ulnar artery is found in a substantial proportion of elderly patients. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ulnar artery occlusion in a sample of the general population of France, look for its risk factors, and evaluate its clinical correlates.\nThis study was an offshoot of a cross-sectional epidemiologic study in the general population of four locations in France (Tarentaise, Grenoble, Nyons, and Toulon). In phase I, random samples of 2000 individuals per location aged >or=18 years old were interviewed by phone for screening of Raynaud phenomenon. In phase II, subsamples of individuals were invited to a medical interview and physical examination where the presence of Raynaud phenomenon and occupational risk factors were recorded and a bilateral clinical Allen test was performed for the detection of ulnar artery occlusion. Phase II comprised 688 women and 335 men.\nIn 36 men and seven women, at least one occluded ulnar artery was found. The estimated prevalence was 9.6% in men and 1.0% in women (P < .001). The occluded artery was more often in the dominant hand of both men (8.1% vs 2.4%; P < .001) and women (0.9% vs 0.4%; P = .34). Ulnar artery occlusion was found more often in men aged >50 years (16.4%) than in younger men (1.4%; P < .001). Besides age, male sex, and dominant side, the only independent risk factor was an occupational exposure in men to repeated palmar trauma, with a significant quantitative relationship in the frequency of the impacts (P < .001) and the duration of the exposure (P < .001). Exposures to hand-held vibrating tools and cigarette smoking did not show a significant relationship in the multivariate analysis. Most individuals with ulnar artery occlusion did not have associated complaints; however, the diagnostic criteria for Raynaud phenomenon was validated in 13 of the 36 affected men. The association remained significant after adjusting for occupational exposure to vibrating tools. One individual reported a previous episode consistent with an attack of permanent digital ischemia.\nThis study confirms a substantial prevalence of ulnar artery occlusions in the general population, mostly in middle-aged and elderly men, which appears to be principally related to an occupational exposure to repeated occupational palmar trauma. Although there is a significant association with Raynaud phenomenon, most often the consequences of this occlusion remain subclinical.",

    "abstract": "Subclinical microemboli on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) have been identified immediately following carotid revascularization procedures, but the clinical significance and long-term effects are largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term radiographic outcomes of these DWI lesions.\nPatients who underwent perioperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations for carotid interventions at a single institution from July 2004 to December 2008 were evaluated, particularly those who had additional follow-up MRI. DWI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted MRI images were compared to determine long-term effect of microemboli.\nOne-hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients (68 carotid artery stenting [CAS] and 100 carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) who received perioperative MRI were included. All CAS were performed with an embolic protection device. The incidence of microemboli was significantly higher in the CAS group than the CEA group (46.3% and 12%, respectively, P < .05) despite a relative low incidence of procedure-associated neurologic symptoms in both groups (2.9% vs 2%). Thirty patients (16 CAS and 14 CEA) who had follow-up MRI were further analyzed and a total of 50 postoperative DWI lesions (mean size 46.57 mm(2); range 16 to 128 mm(2)) were identified among them. During a mean MRI follow-up of 10 months (range, 2 to 23 months), residual MRI abnormalities were only identified in DWI lesions larger than 60 mm(2) on postoperative MRI and on postoperative FLAIR images (n = 5, P < .001). The CEA group had fewer but larger ipsilateral distributed emboli (total 12 lesions, mean 79 mm(2)) compared with the CAS group (total 38 lesions, mean 27.5 mm(2), P < .05).\nThe majority of microemboli do not have long-term radiographic sequelae. Size and hyperintensity on postoperative FLAIR are predictive of residual brain structure abnormality, and further neurocognitive evaluations are warranted.",

    "abstract": "For patients with the most severe manifestations of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease, bypass surgery using autogenous vein has been the most durable reconstruction. However, the incidence of bypass graft stenosis and graft failure remains substantial and wholesale improvements in patency are lacking. One potential explanation is that stenosis arises not only from over exuberant intimal hyperplasia, but also due to insufficient adaptation or remodeling of the vein to the arterial environment. Although in vivo human studies are difficult to conduct, recent advances in imaging technology have made possible a more comprehensive structural examination of vein bypass maturation. This review summarizes recent translational efforts to understand the structural and functional properties of human vein grafts and places it within the context of the rich existing literature of vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) has been increasingly utilized. Early outcomes compare favorably with open mesenteric bypass--the current gold standard. The goal of this study is documentation of intermediate-term anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular mesenteric revascularization for symptomatic CMI.\nThis is a retrospective review of all patients undergoing endovascular treatment of symptomatic CMI from July 2002 to March 2008. Study endpoints included periprocedural mortality, major morbidity, patency, symptomatic recurrence, and survival. Endpoints were analyzed using actuarial methods.\nSixty-six mesenteric arteries (78.8% stenotic/21.2% occluded) were treated in 49 patients. One or more vessels were treated in each case; however, four mesenteric artery total occlusions (3 SMAs/1 IMA) could not be crossed. Initial symptom relief was noted in 89.8% (n = 44) with no change in 5 patients. Single-vessel treatments were performed in 32 patients (65.3%) and two-vessel interventions in 17 (34.7%). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.0% (n = 1). Major complications occurred in 8 patients (16.3%). The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 +/- 2.98 months (range, 0-66). Restenosis on follow-up imaging occurred in 64.9% (n = 24) of the 37 patients who had radiographic surveillance at a mean follow-up interval of 8.5 +/- 1.9 months and was diagnosed most often by Duplex scan or computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Fourteen patients (28.6%) developed recurrent symptoms with 13 requiring a reintervention. Actuarial 36-month freedom from symptomatic recurrence was 60.9% +/- 9.4%. Two-vessel treatment was protective against symptom recurrence (P = .0014) and reintervention (P = .0060) by univariate analysis. A total of 19 reinterventions were required in 14 patients (28.6%) at a mean of 17 months from the original treatment. Primary patency at 36 months was 63.9 +/- 8.5%. Actuarial survival at 48 months was 81.1% +/- 6.1% with no CMI-related deaths in the study cohort.\nIntermediate (3-year) follow-up indicates that significant restenosis and symptom recurrence are common following the endovascular treatment of symptomatic CMI. Thirty percent of the cohort required a reintervention, one-third of which were conversions to surgical reconstruction. Similar to the surgical paradigm of two-vessel revascularization, endovascular treatment of multiple mesenteric arteries produced better outcomes. A first-line endovascular approach to patients with CMI is a reasonable clinical strategy, but close follow-up is mandatory.",

One or more vessels were treated in each case; however, four mesenteric artery total occlusions (3 SMAs/1 IMA) could not be crossed. Initial symptom relief was noted in 89.8% (n = 44) with no change in 5 patients. Single-vessel treatments were performed in 32 patients (65.3%) and two-vessel interventions in 17 (34.7%). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.0% (n = 1). Major complications occurred in 8 patients (16.3%). The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 +/- 2.98 months (range, 0-66). Restenosis on follow-up imaging occurred in 64.9% (n = 24) of the 37 patients who had radiographic surveillance at a mean follow-up interval of 8.5 +/- 1.9 months and was diagnosed most often by Duplex scan or computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Fourteen patients (28.6%) developed recurrent symptoms with 13 requiring a reintervention. Actuarial 36-month freedom from symptomatic recurrence was 60.9% +/- 9.4%. Two-vessel treatment was protective against symptom recurrence (P = .0014) and reintervention (P = .0060) by univariate analysis. A total of 19 reinterventions were required in 14 patients (28.6%) at a mean of 17 months from the original treatment. Primary patency at 36 months was 63.9 +/- 8.5%. Actuarial survival at 48 months was 81.1% +/- 6.1% with no CMI-related deaths in the study cohort.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the sequelae of the intentional left subclavian artery (LSA) coverage during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).\nRetrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a single center. Between March 1997 and October 2008, 88 of 220 patients (40%) had thoracic aortic lesions that required LSA coverage during TEVAR. Thirty-four of our patients (39%) were treated under urgent or emergent conditions for acute pathologies. The proximal landing zone was zone 0 in 10 patients (11%), zone 1 in 24 patients (27%), and zone 2 in 54 patients (61%). Debranching procedures of the supra-aortic vessels were performed in patients who were to undergo zone 0 or zone 1 deployment. Primary LSA revascularization was performed in 22 of the 88 patients (25%) at a median of 6 days before TEVAR. Median follow-up was 26.4 months (1-98 months).\nTechnical success was achieved in 97%. Five primary (9%) and two secondary (4%) type Ia endoleaks in patients who underwent zone 2 deployment were observed and required further interventions. Fourteen (16%) primary type II endoleaks were observed; 10 of them fed by the LSA. Paraplegia rate was lower in patients with LSA coverage without revascularization than in other patients (1.5% vs 1.9%; odds ratio [OR], 0.774; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.038-6.173; P = 1.000). Prior or concomitant infrarenal aortic replacement (P = .0019), renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) (P = .0024) and long segment aortic coverage (>200 mm) (P = .0157) were associated with significant higher risk of postoperative paraplegia. Stroke rate was lower in patients with LSA coverage without revascularization than in other patients (3% vs 3.9%; OR, 0.570; 95% CI, 0.118-2.761; P = .7269). Two patients (3%) developed left upper extremity symptoms and another two patients (3%) subclavian steal syndrome and required secondary LSA revascularization. The technical success rate for LSA revascularization was 94%.\nBy using a selective approach to the LSA revascularization, coverage of the LSA can be used to extend the proximal seal zone for TEVAR without increasing the risk of spinal cord ischemia or stroke. Indications for revascularization include long segment aortic coverage, prior or concomitant infrarenal aortic replacement, and renal insufficiency. In addition, a hypoplastic right vertebral artery, a patent left internal mammary artery graft, and a functioning dialysis fistula in the left arm would also be indications to perform revascularization.",

    "abstract": "In 1994, our hospital reported a significant gender disparity in the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The objective of this study was to determine if this gender-based treatment disparity still persists after 15 years.\nA retrospective review of patients with PAD and carotid artery disease based on vascular laboratory studies was performed from January 2006 to February 2008. PAD was identified by ankle-brachial index <or= 0.9 or abnormal waveform. Treatable carotid artery disease was identified by symptomatic stenosis 60%-99% or asymptomatic stenosis 80%-99%. Patients with interventions before January 2006 were excluded. Demographics, risk factors, and interventions were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors and independent predictors of intervention.\nOf 2,313 peripheral artery studies, 592 patients with PAD and no prior intervention were identified. Sixty-five (21.7%) of 299 men and 47 (16.0%) of 293 women underwent angioplasty, stenting, endarterectomy, or bypass grafting. This difference was not significant (P = .077). However, by multivariate analysis of patients with critical limb ischemia, Caucasian race was an independent predictor of intervention (P = .010; odds ratio [OR] 3.363). Of 3,505 carotid duplex studies, 253 patients with treatable carotid artery disease and no prior intervention were identified. Seventy-eight (52.7%) of 148 men and 43 (41.0%) of 105 women underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting. This difference was not significant (P = .065). However, by multivariate analysis, Caucasian race was identified as an independent predictor of intervention (P = .015, OR 3.033). Insurance status was not a predictor of intervention in either the PAD (P = .70) or carotid artery disease cohort (P = .99).\nOur data reveal that gender was not an independent predictor of intervention for PAD or carotid artery disease; however, Caucasian race independently predicted a greater likelihood of intervention in PAD patients with critical limb ischemia and in the carotid artery disease cohort. This study demonstrates the importance of performance assessments in uncovering unsuspected treatment disparities.",

The analysis included meta-analysis, randomized, and population-based studies of thrombosed arteriovenous fistulae and grafts.\nOne meta-analysis and eight randomized studies on the treatment of arteriovenous graft thrombosis were identified. Studies conducted before 2002 demonstrated a significantly better primary success rate and primary and secondary patencies of surgical thrombectomy vs endovascular intervention. After 2002, similar results of both techniques have been reported. Only population-based studies on the treatment of thrombosed autogenous arteriovenous fistulae have been published, showing similar outcome of surgical and endovascular intervention in terms of primary success. The long-term primary and secondary patencies are slightly better for surgical treatment, but this concerns only forearm fistulae.\nThe outcome of endovascular and surgical intervention for thrombosed vascular access is comparable, in particular for thrombosed prosthetic grafts. Surgical treatment of autogenous arteriovenous fistulae is likely to have benefit compared with endovascular means. Definitive randomized trials are needed to provide the level 1 evidence to resolve this latter issue.",

Although the indication for surgical therapy is controversially discussed in the literature for celiac artery compression syndrome, it is unequivocally for renal artery entrapment. We present the case of a young woman who was assigned to our hospital with arterial hypertension and stenosis of the left renal artery. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed, immediate recoil occurred. Therefore, the suspicion of entrapment by diaphragmatic crura was expressed. Additionally performed diagnostic procedures including computed tomography (CT)-angiography verified our suspicion. Surgical decompression of both vessels was successfully performed.",

    "abstract": "In peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients, a limiting factor in the success of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the development of restenosis secondary to vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Following endothelial damage and platelet activation, there is release of factors and adhesion molecules which affect SMC proliferation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of combination antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin and placebo) on the ability of plasma from PAD patients undergoing PTA to stimulate SMCs in vitro. We further aimed to investigate the effect of combination treatment on the levels of circulating adhesion molecules and factors, which are known to mediate SMC proliferation in experimental models.\nFifty patients were randomized to receive blinded clopidogrel or placebo, for thirty days, in addition to their daily 75 mg aspirin. To measure proliferative capacity, diluted plasma was incubated for 15 minutes with 24 hour-growth-arrested rat vascular smooth muscle cells, and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activation was analyzed by Western blotting at baseline, one hour pre-PTA, one hour, 24 hours and 30 days post-PTA. Plasma platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), sE-selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured by ELISA, at the same five timepoints. Platelet activation was measured by flow cytometry of ADP-stimulated platelet fibrinogen binding at baseline and one hour post-PTA.\nADP-stimulated platelet fibrinogen binding was significantly inhibited by clopidogrel before and after PTA. ERK 1/2 activation was significantly increased post-PTA in both the aspirin/clopidogrel and aspirin/placebo groups (P < .001). There was a statistically significant decrease in PDGF (P = .004), and increase in vWF (P = .026), following loading with clopidogrel. sICAM-1 levels significantly decreased (P = .016) in the aspirin/placebo group following PTA. There were no other significant changes and also there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups for each of ERK 1/2, sICAM-1, sE-selectin, or vWF.\nThis is the first study to show in-vitro ERK 1/2 activation (a surrogate marker of SMC proliferation) increases post-PTA. Combination antiplatelet therapy had no significant effect on this, although it did reduce PDGF. Further work is required to evaluate potential therapeutic treatments, which may reduce peripheral PTA-induced smooth muscle cell activation.\nHigh rates of restenosis remain the major limitation of peripheral arterial angioplasty and stenting.The restenotic lesion occurs secondary to platelet activation, released circulating factors, and subsequent smooth musclecell proliferation and migration into the intima. Methods to limit the restenotic lesion are poorly understood. This paperinvestigates the effect of PTA on smooth muscle cell activation and the release of factors in plasma which mediate SMCproliferation. It also examines the effect of combination antiplatelet therapy as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "There is little documentation of the effectiveness of percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA) of infrapopliteal vessels for the treatment of chronic lower extremity ischemia. This study reviewed our recent experience with infrapopliteal PTA in a large series of patients to determine its effectiveness as a treatment modality.\nAll patients undergoing primary infrapopliteal PTA from March 2002 to June 2006 were included. Primary study end points were primary patency, assisted patency, limb salvage, and patient survival assessed by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Factors predictive of PTA failure and patient longevity were evaluated by multivariate methods.\nThere were 155 PTAs undertaken in 144 patients (70% men; mean age, 74 years), with critical limb ischemia (86%), diabetes (66%), and renal insufficiency (45%). Infrapopliteal lesions were classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus A (7%), B (18%), C (39%), and D (35%). PTA was confined to the infrapopliteal segment in 40 (26%), and 115 (74%) underwent multilevel treatment. Five patients (3%) received stents. Technical success was 95%. The 30-day mortality was 2%, and major morbidity was 3%. The mean follow-up was 22 months (range, 0-54 months). The 40-month actuarial primary patency was 62% (standard error, 5%), with assisted patency (infrapopliteal re-PTA, 25 [16%]) of 90%. Interval conversion to bypass surgery occurred in seven (5%). Nonhealing ulcers occurred in 118 patients (76%), of which 76 (64%) healed during follow-up. Of the 42 unhealed ulcers, 15 (13%) required major amputations for a 40-month limb salvage of 86.2%. Multivariate predictors that were negative for primary patency included 0/1 vessel runoff (P = .01), critical limb ischemia (P = .002), and dialysis (P = .03). Negative predictors of limb salvage included dialysis (P = .007) and failure to improve runoff to the foot (P = .006). At 40-months, patient survival was 54%, with negative predictors including severe pulmonary disease (P = .01), coronary artery disease (P = .04), and renal insufficiency (P < .001).\nInfrapopliteal angioplasty can be performed safely with favorable results in patients with limited longevity. Primary patency is related to disease extent. Secondary interventions may be necessary to maintain clinical success. These data indicate that PTA should be considered as initial therapy for infrapopliteal occlusive disease in patients with lower extremity ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is used in patients considered high-risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Patients qualify as high-risk because of medical comorbid conditions or for anatomic considerations (previous CEA, radical neck dissection, radiation). We compared the technical feasibility and durability of CAS in medically high-risk patients (MED) vs anatomically high-risk patients (ANAT).\nA retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing CAS by a single vascular surgery group. All patients were high risk and evaluated with duplex ultrasound imaging and angiography. Primary end points were technical success, 30-day stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), death, and in-stent restenosis. Standard statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier life tables.\nFrom January 2003 to December 2007, 230 CAS (98 ANAT, 132 MED) procedures were attempted. The ANAT cohort comprised 84 patients with a single anatomic risk factor: 71 with a previous ipsilateral CEA, 6 high lesions, 6 history of neck radiation, and 1 with a tracheostomy. Ten patients had two or three anatomic risk factors: nine with radical neck dissection and radiation and one with neck radiation and ipsilateral CEA. The mean age was 71.1 years for ANAT vs 73.9 years for MED (P = .021). Technical success rates were 98% in ANAT and 98.5% in MED (P = .76). Thirty-day stroke rate was 1.0% in ANAT and 5.3% in MED (P = .14); the mortality rate was 2.0% in ANAT and 0.8% in MED (P = .79). The 2-year survival free from stroke was MED, 93.6% and ANAT, 98.9% (P = .118); and from restenosis was MED, 91.9%; and ANAT, 91.0% (P = .98). Two-year overall survival was significantly better in ANAT (84.6%) vs MED (70.1%; P = .026). Four of the seven restenoses in the ANAT group occurred in patients with previous neck radiation. The restenosis rate for radiation-induced (RAD) stenosis treated with CAS was significantly higher at 22.2% (4 of 18) compared with 3.8% (3 of 78) in ANAT group patients without a history of radiation (non-RAD; P = .028). The 2-year restenosis-free survival was 72.7% in the RAD group vs 95.9% in the non-RAD group (P = .017).\nCAS is as technically feasible, safe, and durable in anatomically high-risk patients as in medically high-risk patients, with similar rates of periprocedural stroke and death and late restenosis. However, patients with radiation-induced stenosis appear to be at an increased risk for restenosis.",

The ANAT cohort comprised 84 patients with a single anatomic risk factor: 71 with a previous ipsilateral CEA, 6 high lesions, 6 history of neck radiation, and 1 with a tracheostomy. Ten patients had two or three anatomic risk factors: nine with radical neck dissection and radiation and one with neck radiation and ipsilateral CEA. The mean age was 71.1 years for ANAT vs 73.9 years for MED (P = .021). Technical success rates were 98% in ANAT and 98.5% in MED (P = .76). Thirty-day stroke rate was 1.0% in ANAT and 5.3% in MED (P = .14); the mortality rate was 2.0% in ANAT and 0.8% in MED (P = .79). The 2-year survival free from stroke was MED, 93.6% and ANAT, 98.9% (P = .118); and from restenosis was MED, 91.9%; and ANAT, 91.0% (P = .98). Two-year overall survival was significantly better in ANAT (84.6%) vs MED (70.1%; P = .026). Four of the seven restenoses in the ANAT group occurred in patients with previous neck radiation. The restenosis rate for radiation-induced (RAD) stenosis treated with CAS was significantly higher at 22.2% (4 of 18) compared with 3.8% (3 of 78) in ANAT group patients without a history of radiation (non-RAD; P = .028). The 2-year restenosis-free survival was 72.7% in the RAD group vs 95.9% in the non-RAD group (P = .017).",

    "abstract": "This article reports the intermediate-term (24-month) outcomes of a prospective multicenter trial designed to evaluate the Zenith Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) for treating juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms with short proximal necks. The study goals were to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the device and refine patient selection criteria.\nFive centers in the United States enrolled 30 patients with juxtarenal aortic aneurysms with >or=50-mm diameter and short proximal necks. Devices were custom-designed for each patient based on measurements from reconstructed computed tomography (CT) data. Follow-up studies included physical examinations, laboratory studies, CT imaging, mesenteric-renal duplex ultrasound imaging, and abdominal flat plate radiographs at hospital discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter up to 5 years.\nDuring a 1-year period, 30 patients (80% men; mean age, 75 years) with a mean aneurysm size of 61.4 mm were enrolled. In these 30 patients, 77 visceral vessels were accommodated by fenestrations located within the sealing segment of the grafts. The most common design accommodated two renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery (66.7%). All prostheses were implanted successfully. No visceral arteries were lost. Of the 30 patients treated, 27 were available for 12-month follow-up and 23 were available for 24-month follow-up. No aneurysm-related deaths, aneurysm ruptures, or conversions were observed through 24 months of follow-up. No type I or type III endoleaks were observed. Type II endoleaks were noted in six (26.1%) at 12 months and four (20.0%) at 24 months. No patients had aneurysm growth >5 mm. Aneurysm size decreased in 16 of 23 (69.6%) and was stable in the remaining patients at 24 months. Eight patients experienced a renal event (4 renal artery stenoses, 2 renal artery occlusions, and 2 renal infarcts). Five underwent secondary interventions. No renal failure developed requiring dialysis.\nThe intermediate-term (24-month) results of the 30 patients in this multicenter study are concordant with previous single-center studies and support the concept that placement of fenestrated endovascular grafts is safe and effective at centers with experience in endovascular repair and renal/mesenteric stent placement.",

    "abstract": "Open surgical repair after failed endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) usually involves complete endograft removal and replacement with a prosthetic surgical graft. This is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We have used an alternative strategy focused on limiting the magnitude of surgical repair by preserving the functioning portion of the endograft and avoiding aortic cross-clamping, when possible.\nBetween January 2000 and 2008, patients requiring delayed conversion after EVAR at our institution were managed with (1) complete endograft preservation and external wrap of the aortic neck to secure a proximal seal, or (2) partial endograft removal with interposition grafting from the infrarenal aortic neck to the remaining endograft. Records of all patients were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, operative details, and outcomes.\nDuring this time, 12 patients were treated with delayed open surgical conversion. The indication for conversion in all patients was a type I endoleak with aneurysm enlargement not amendable to percutaneous intervention. Mean age was 81 +/- 6.2 years (range, 61-90 years). Average time to conversion was 44.7 months (range, 7-80 months). Complete endograft preservation was attempted in eight patients and was successful in six (75%). The two patients that failed this approach, as well as four additional patients who were not candidates for this approach, underwent partial endograft excision and replacement with an interposition graft sutured to the remaining portion of the stent graft. Complete endograft removal was not required in any patients. There was one post-operative mortality (8.3%) and one significant post-operative morbidity (8.3%). Mean intensive care unit and hospital stays were 2.8 +/- 3.9 days (range, 1-15 days) and 8.4 +/- 5.8 days (range, 3-26 days), respectively.\nOpen surgical repair of failed EVAR can be accomplished with preservation of all or a significant portion of the endograft in most patients. This may limit the magnitude of the repair procedure and may reduce morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Black patients have a higher mortality rate than nonblacks after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. We sought to understand the factors responsible for this racial disparity in the mortality rate after aneurysm repair.\nThe Medicare database (2001-2006) was used to identify 160,785 patients undergoing open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs. We used risk-adjusted mortality as our primary measure of quality and logistic regression to determine the relationship between race and mortality, sequentially adding contributing factors including patient characteristics, the type of repair (endovascular vs open repair), socioeconomic status, and hospital quality. From these sequential regression models, we estimated the proportion of the disparity that can be explained by each factor.\nBlack patients had a 36% higher risk-adjusted mortality after aneurysm repair than nonblack patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.53). Even after accounting for the type of repair, a significant difference in mortality remained (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.50). Mortality rates were higher in hospitals treating a higher proportion of black patients. Adjusting for these differences in hospital quality, this disparity was no longer significant (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25). We estimate that 29% of the observed disparity in mortality is caused by patient comorbidities, 6% from the use of endovascular repairs, 26% due to socioeconomic factors, and 25% because black patients receive care in lower-quality hospitals.\nAlthough many factors contribute, a large proportion of observed disparities in outcomes are attributable to black patients receiving care in lower-quality hospitals. Efforts aimed at improving disparities must focus on improved access to high-quality hospitals and improved resources at the hospitals that treat higher proportions of black patients.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the size of the future workforce in vascular surgery (VS) and the added cost associated with addressing the projected shortage in the United States.\nThe net supply (number of Vascular Surgeons [VSN] currently practicing, new graduates entering the workforce, and those retiring) for each decade was calculated. The projected population for each decade was determined by U.S. Census Bureau figures. Some assumptions of this model included: (1) In 2008, the population was 300,000,000; (2) There were 2783 board certified VSN in 2008; (3) VSN will practice 30 years from board certification to retirement; (4) There will be 105 board certifications and 93 retirements per year; (5) Vascular operations will remain at 284 per 100,000 population; (6) Salaries of trainees will be $50,000 with benefits of 30% and $15,000 of additional direct medical education costs.\nPopulation and workload analysis suggests that there will be a shortage of 330 surgeons (9.8%) and 399 surgeons (11.6%) by 2030, respectively. The cost of training enough VSN (in a six-year program) by 2030 will be between $1,166,400,000 and $1,199,520,000.\nA conservative estimate by both population and workload analysis, disregarding aging of the population, lifestyle choices of future VSN, and increasing demand for services, indicates a shortage of VSN in the future. Unless the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is revised by Congress, the cost to train the additional VS workforce remains a significant barrier.",

    "abstract": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a proatherogenic molecule that accumulates in the vascular wall and contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction early in the development of atherosclerosis. The whole plant of Solanum lyratum is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for centuries to treat cancer, tumors, and herpes. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of its antioxidant effects are still largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that Solanum lyratum Thunberg extract (SLE) could block oxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Possible mechanisms were explored.\nAntioxidative activities of SLE were assayed by measuring the scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and the inhibition of copper-mediated or cell-mediated LDL oxidation. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of adhesion molecules were evaluated in HUVECs after exposure to oxLDL and treatment with SLE. Several apoptotic signaling pathways were investigated.\nSLE scavenged DPPH and also delayed the kinetics of LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. SLE attenuated the level of oxLDL-induced ROS generation, diminished the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), and enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules (vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and the adherence of monocytic THP-1 cells to HUVECs. OxLDL increased the concentration of intracellular calcium, disturbed the balance of the Bcl-2 protein family, destabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased the amount of cytochrome c released into the cytosol, and increased the activation of caspase 3. These detrimental effects were ameliorated dose-dependently by SLE (P < .05).\nCrude extracts of Solanum lyratum protect against oxLDL-induced injury in endothelial cells by direct antioxidant action.\nAtherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by lipid-laden lesions within arterialblood vessel walls. Inhibiting the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein may be an effective way to prevent or delay theprogression of atherosclerosis. This study underscores the potential clinical benefits and application of Solanum lyratumextract in controlling oxidized low-density lipoprotein-associated vascular injury and cardiovascular disease.",

OxLDL increased the concentration of intracellular calcium, disturbed the balance of the Bcl-2 protein family, destabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased the amount of cytochrome c released into the cytosol, and increased the activation of caspase 3. These detrimental effects were ameliorated dose-dependently by SLE (P < .05).",

    "abstract": "While single growth factor has limitation to induce optimal neovascularization, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous reserver of various growth factors. However, little is known about the mechanism of PRP-related neovascularization.The objective of this investigation was to characterize the angiogenic and growth factor content of PRP and to determine, in vitro, its effect on endothelial cell proliferation. Additionally, this experiment sought to determine the effectiveness of different compositions of PRP (solution versus sustained release) on perfusion and neovascularization in a murine model of hind limb ischemia.\nDifferent growth factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vivo study, we used gelatin hydrogel as a sustained release carrier for growth factors in PRP. We induced hind limb ischemia by excising right femoral artery in wild type C57BL6 mice. After surgery, mice were randomly assigned to four experimental groups; control (C), 100 muL of sustained release form of platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 100 muL of solution form of PRP (PRP-sol), 100 muL of sustained release form of PRP (PRP-sr); each formulation was administered via an intramuscular injection to the ischemic hind limb. Endpoint evaluations were blood perfusion by laser Doppler perfusion image, vascular density by anti Von Willebrand factor (vWF), and mature vessel density by anti smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibody. Green fluorescent protein (GFP+) transgenic mice were generated by transplantation of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells to wild type C57BL6 mice, and finally CD34+ cell in the ischemic site of transgenic mice was detected by staining with anti-CD34 antibody.\nIn vitro study showed that PRP containing different growth factors induces endothelial cell proliferation and capillary tube formation. In vivo study demonstrated that sustained release of PRP increased perfusion of ischemic tissue as measured by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) (57 +/- 12, 56 +/- 9, 72 +/- 7, 98 +/- 4 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively; P < .05); capillary density (151 +/- 16, 158 +/- 12, 189 +/- 39, 276 +/- 39 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively, P < .05) and mature vessel density (28 +/- 2, 31 +/- 3, 52 +/- 10, 85 +/- 13 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively, P < .05) . Sustained release PRP also increases CD34+ cells in the ischemic site of transgenic mice (6 +/- 3 vs 18 +/- 5/mm(2) for groups control and PRP-sr respectively, P < .05).\nSustained release of PRP containing potent angiogenic growth factors restores blood perfusion presumably by stimulating angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, as well as vasculogenesis in the mouse hind limb ischemia.\nPRP is a natural reserver of various growth factors that can be collected autologously and is costeffective. Thus for clinical use, no special considerations concerning antibody formation and infection risk are needed.Some clinical devices to automatically prepare PRP are available at present. PRP are consistently being used clinically inthe department of orthopedics and plastic surgery (oral, maxillary facial) for a long time. On the basis of researchevidence, some publications have reported positive results in either bone or soft tissue healing. However, some researchconcludes that there is no or little benefit from PRP. This is likely due to faster degradation of growth factors in PRP sincesome authors suggest using sustained release form of PRP to deliver optimal effect of PRP. Gelatin hydrogel is also beingused clinically as a slow, sustained release of carrier for growth factors in our center recently.",

    "abstract": "There are still some vascular surgeons who do not use carotid patching routinely in all patients undergoing CEA, however, based on the data presented in this review, there is Level 1 evidence to support the routine use of carotid patching. Meanwhile, there is no Level 1 evidence to support selective patching for CEA, however a Grade D recommendation may be used to recommend that primary closure can be safely practiced in a large ICA (>6mm). A meta-analysis/systemic review of well-conducted prospective randomized trials (Level 1 evidence) concluded that there was no difference in stroke/death rates between conventional CEA with patch closure and eversion CEA. The incidence of significant restenosis with eversion CEA is also similar to CEA with patch closure, however eversion CEA had a lower restenosis rate than patients undergoing CEA with primary closure. Prior to the GALA trial, there was insufficient evidence from randomized clinical trials comparing CEA under local anesthesia versus general anesthesia to support the superiority of either technique in reducing major perioperative events, i.e. stroke, MI, or death. However, the GALA trial concluded that the perioperative stroke/MI and death rates were equivalent in both techniques.",

    "abstract": "The geometry and dynamics of the vena cava are poorly understood and current knowledge is largely based on qualitative data. The purpose of this study is to quantitate the dimensional changes that occur in the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC), in response to changes in intravascular volume.\nIVC dimensions were measured at 1 cm and 5 cm below the renal veins, on serial contrasted computed tomographic (CT) scans, in 30 severely injured trauma patients during hypovolemic (admission) and fluid resuscitated (follow-up) states. Changes in volume of the infrarenal segment were calculated and correlated with changes in IVC diameter and orientation. The orientation of the infrarenal caval segment was quantified as the angulation of the major axis from the horizontal. A representation of the IVC diameter, as would be seen on standard anterior-posterior venographic imaging, was determined by projecting the CT image of the major axis onto a coronal plane. CT representations of venographic diameters were compared with measurements of the true major axis to assess accuracy of venograms for caval sizing and filter selection.\nAll patients had evidence of a collapsed IVC (<15 mm minor axis dimension) on admission. Mean time between admission and follow-up CT was 49.5 (range: 1-202) days. The volume of the infrarenal segment increased more than twofold with resuscitation, increasing from 6.9 +/- 2.2 (range: 3.1-12.4) mL on admission, to 15.7 +/- 5.0 (range: 9.2-28.5) mL on follow-up (P < .01). At both 1 and 5 cm below the renal veins, the IVC expanded anisotropically such that the minor axis expanded up to five times its initial size accommodating 84% of the increased volume of the segment, while only small diameter changes were observed in the major axis accounting for less than 5% of the volume increase (P < .001). Further, the IVC was left-anterior-oblique in all patients, with the major axis 26 degrees off the horizontal on average. This orientation did not change significantly with volume resuscitation (P > 0.5). The obliquity of the IVC resulted in significant underestimation of caval size of up to 6.8 mm, when using the venographic representation for sizing instead of the true major axis (P < 0.001).\nIn response to changes in intravascular volume, the IVC undergoes profound anisotropic dimensional changes, with greater displacement seen in the minor axis. In addition, the IVC is oriented left-anterior oblique and caval orientation is not altered by changes in volume status. IVC obliquity may result in underestimation of caval size by anterior-posterior venogram.",

    "abstract": "Silver-coated vascular polyester prostheses were developed not only for the treatment of prosthetic graft infections, but also for use as prophylaxes. Although some studies describe the use of these prostheses in cases of infection, there are few data on their prophylactic use. This study compares the performance of the InterGard Silver polyester graft (Intervascular, Datascope, Inc, La Ciotat, France) with that of standard prostheses in routine use.\nThis retrospective study included all patients who received alloplastic bypass for treatment of arterial occlusive disease at the University Hospital in W\u00fcrzburg from January 1996 to December 2006. The courses of disease were analyzed by examining the medical records. Follow-up research documented long-term results.\nThe cases of 913 patients were analyzed (430 silver grafts, 483 standard grafts). Indications for the operations were claudication (silver: 136, nonsilver: 212), rest pain (49/65), tissue loss (135/148), and acute occlusion (110/58). Prosthetic implantation was performed in the aorto-iliaco-femoral position (silver: 93, nonsilver: 146), in the femorodistal position (309/304), and as multilevel reconstruction (28/33). With regard to perioperative complications, the two groups did not differ significantly. There were no silver release-related complications, such as colored exudation or wound staining. Mean follow-up time was 56.7 +/- 1.6 (SEM) months. When corrected for redo procedures, stage of disease, and type of reconstruction, both materials performed equally well: 5-year patency for claudication: silver 91%, nonsilver 95%, femorodistal 47%/41%; 5-year patency for critical ischemia: aortofemoral 88%/93%, femorodistal 31%/35%; 5-year limb salvage (critical ischemia): aortofemoral: 78%/79%; femorodistal: 59%/67%. Graft infections (Szilagyi grade III) were detected in 59 patients (6.4%; silver: n = 32, 7.4% vs control: n = 27, 5.5%; P = .28) after an average of 321 +/- 96 days. One infection occurred out of 93 aortofemoral operations with the silver prosthesis (1.1%) compared to 4.1% (6/146) in the control group (P = .17). For patients with femorodistal grafts, silver exhibited an infection rate of 9.4% compared to 5.9% (P = .11). In the multiple regression analysis, two factors influenced the rate of a graft infection significantly: wound healing impairment and revision after bypass implantation. Silver did not prevent a subsequent bypass infection in these cases (silver: 18.1% vs 12.5%, P = .27).\nThe silver-coated prosthesis did not differ from standard materials. Silver had no significant effect on the risk of graft infection. Our study showed good results with the silver prosthesis in the aorto-iliaco-femoral position, but in cases of femorodistal grafting, a reduction of prosthetic infections was not achieved.

Bacteria cultures positive for MDR Pa were obtained from 129 patients, and 64 CLI patients treated with IBS formed the study group. A control group of 64 was retrospectively matched from MDR Pa-negative patients treated with IBS in the same unit according to sex, age, presence of diabetes, Fontaine class, graft material, and site of the distal anastomosis. The most frequent sites of initial positive MDR Pa culture were the incisional wound in 30 (47%) and ischemic ulcer in 23 (36%). Median time between the positive MDR Pa-culture and IBS was 14 days (range, 56 days pre-IBS to 246 days post-IBS). Graft patency, survival, leg salvage, and amputation-free survival were assessed.\nOne-year amputation-free survival (+/- standard error) was 52% +/- 6% in the MDR Pa group vs 75% +/- 5% in the control group (P = .02). Five-year amputation-free survival was 29% +/- 6% in the MDR Pa group and 32% +/- 6% in the control group (P = .144). For MDR Pa and control groups, the 1-year survival was 69% +/- 6% and 82% +/- 5% (P = .063), respectively, and 5-year survival was 36% +/- 6% and 36% +/- 6% (P = .302), respectively. For the MDR Pa and control groups, leg salvage was 79% +/- 5% and 92% +/- 4% at 1 year (P = .078) and 73% +/- 7% and 87% +/- 5% at 5 years (P = .126), respectively. The overall secondary patency rate at 1 year was 72% +/- 7% in the MDR Pa group vs 81% +/- 6% in the control group (P = .149). Local wound surgery was more frequent in MDR Pa patients than in controls (P = .002).\nThe MDR Pa outbreak was associated with a decreased short-term amputation-free survival after IBS for CLI in patients with positive MDR Pa culture. The potential risks of MDR Pa should be seriously considered whenever a positive culture is obtained in a vascular patient with CLI.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to validate high-frequency ultrasound (HFU) measurement of dermal thickness for quantification of edema in patients with different severities of chronic venous disease.\nHFU measurements of dermal thickness were made with a 17-MHz probe (Philips iU22 Ultrasound scanner, Bothell, Wash) or a 20-MHz medium-focus probe (DermaScan-C, Cortex Technology, Denmark), 7.5 cm above the medial malleolus. For validation, 20 patients with venous leg ulcers who were not receiving compression therapy, 20 patients with previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) without ulceration, and 31 age-matched healthy controls were measured on a single occasion. To investigate the effect of compression on dermal thickness, the leg ulcer patients from the validation study were treated with compression therapy for 7 weeks and measured after 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks. The association between dermal thickness and the clinical (C) component of the CEAP classification was examined in a cross-sectional analysis of 157 patients with a confirmed history of DVT >or=3 years ago.\nDermal thickness in patients with venous leg ulcers before compression therapy (median, 2.56 mm; interquartile range [IQR], 2.31-2.82 mm) was significantly greater (P = .002) than that in patients with symptoms of PTS without ulceration (median, 2.16 mm; IQR, 1.90-2.36 mm). Dermal thickness in both groups was significantly greater (P < .0001) than the control group (median, 1.34 mm; IQR, 1.29-1.44 mm). Compression therapy caused a steady and significant decrease in dermal thickness during the first 5 weeks until normal control levels were achieved. Dermal thickness increased with increasing CEAP category. In 121 patients with a positive diagnosis of DVT >or=3 years ago from Radiology Department records, a hypothetical test cutoff of 1.985 mm for the prediction of severe PTS noted as C(4b), C(5), and C(6) (lipodermatosclerosis or leg ulceration) had a positive predictive value of 46.9% and a negative predictive value of 90.3%.\nHFU measurement of dermal thickness enables the monitoring of edema reduction by compression therapy. A prospective study is required to determine the temporal dynamics of dermal thickness changes after DVT and the relationship to the development of PTS. This test has the potential to be beneficial in the follow-up of patients after a DVT and provide clinical evidence for using graduated elastic compression stockings to control edema and prevent the development of more advanced skin changes.",

    "abstract": "The PREVENT III (PIII) critical limb ischemia (CLI) risk score is a simple, published tool derived from the PIII randomized clinical trial that can be used for estimating amputation-free survival (AFS) in CLI patients considered for infrainguinal bypass (IB). The current study sought to validate this risk stratification model using data from the prospectively collected Vascular Study Group of Northern New England (VSGNNE).\nWe calculated the PIII CLI risk score for 1166 patients undergoing IB with autogenous vein by 59 surgeons at 11 hospitals between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007. Points (pts) were assigned to each patient for the presence of dialysis (4 pts), tissue loss (3 pts), age >or=75 (2 pts), and coronary artery disease (CAD) (1 pt). Baseline hematocrit was not included due to a large proportion of missing values. Total scores were used to stratify each patient into low-risk (<or=3 pts), med-risk (4-7 pts), and high-risk (>or=8 pts) categories. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate AFS for the three risk groups. Log-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons. To assess validation, comparison to the PIII derivation and validation sets was performed.\nStratification of the VSGNNE patients by risk category yielded three significantly different estimates for 1-year AFS (86.4%, 74.0%, and 56.1%, for low-, med-, and high-risk groups). Intergroup comparison demonstrated precise discrimination (P < .0001). For a given risk category (low, med, or high), the 1-year AFS estimates in the VSGNNE dataset were consistent with those observed in the previously published PIII derivation set (85.9%, 73.0%, and 44.6%, respectively), PIII validation set (87.7%, 63.7%, and 45.0%, respectively), and retrospective multicenter validation set (86.3%, 70.1%, and 47.8%, respectively).\nThe PIII CLI risk score has now been both internally and externally validated by testing it against the outcomes of 3286 CLI patients who underwent autogenous vein bypass at 94 institutions by a diverse array of physicians (three independent cohorts of patients). This tool provides a simple and reliable method to risk stratify CLI patients being considered for IB. At initial consultation, calculation of the PIII CLI risk score can reliably stratify patients according to their risk of death or major amputation at 1 year.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the femoral artery is associated with symptoms ranging from claudication to tissue loss. This study examined the clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of isolated femoral endarterectomy (FEA) as well as the predictors of symptom recurrence and need for further intervention.\nPatients who underwent an isolated FEA between January 2001 and June 2008 were reviewed. Concurrent superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease was classified into Trans Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) II categories based upon angiographic findings. Hemodynamic success (HS) was defined as a postoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) increase of >or=0.15. Clinical improvement was classified by Rutherford criteria. Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of clinical failure and need for additional intervention (AI). Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to determine the likelihood of both over time.\nNinety-five patients (105 limbs) with a mean age of 68.3 +/- 10.2 years were reviewed. Indications were severe claudication in 68 (64.8%) limbs and critical limb ischemia (CLI) in 37 (35.2%). Mean preprocedural ABI was 0.57 +/- 0.25. The SFA-popliteal segment was classified as: normal in 34% of limbs, TASC A 23%, B 19%, C 9%, and D in 15%. One fatal myocardial infarction accounted for a procedural mortality of 0.95%. Morbidity was 6.7% (four hematomas and three wound infections) and mean hospital stay was 2.5 +/- 3.1 days. Patency was 100% with a mean follow-up of 11 months (1-72). Complete resolution of symptoms was noted in 73.4% with some clinical improvement noted in 91% of limbs. HS was achieved in 85.1% with a mean ABI increase of 0.27 +/- 0.20, and this correlated with >or=2 runoff vessels (odds ratio [OR] 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.96; P = .045). Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed that 83.8% of patients with marked initial clinical improvement remained symptom free at 2 years, whereas only 28.6% in the group with mild and moderate initial response maintained their clinical status. Freedom from AI at 2 years was 61.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that TASC C and D lesions (OR 9.3 [2.43-35.63] P = .001) and diabetes (OR 3.64 [1.01-13.15] P = .048) were predictive of recurrent symptoms while extensive endarterectomy and >or=2 vessel tibial runoff decreased the need for AI.\nFEA can achieve excellent immediate clinical and hemodynamic outcome in patients with claudication and CLI; however, patients with diabetes and femoropopliteal TASC C and D lesions are likely to experience recurrent symptoms. Long-term symptomatic improvement is associated with the degree of immediate clinical success as well as the status of the run-off vessels. Limited FEA and poor tibial runoff are associated with the need for AI.",

Multivariate analysis revealed that TASC C and D lesions (OR 9.3 [2.43-35.63] P = .001) and diabetes (OR 3.64 [1.01-13.15] P = .048) were predictive of recurrent symptoms while extensive endarterectomy and >or=2 vessel tibial runoff decreased the need for AI.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have evaluated the natural history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but few have correlated the clinical progression using duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging during the first year. This study was designed to determine the relationship of changes in the venous system and correlate them with long-term progression of disease.\nConsecutive patients with a first episode of proximal DVT documented by DU imaging were included prospectively. Clinic examinations were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. The CEAP system was used to grade disease severity. DU imaging was performed at least once, 1 year after the diagnosis, and repeated at 5 years. The proximal veins were divided the common femoral vein, femoral vein, and popliteal vein segments for analysis. Thrombosed veins were subsequently graded as completely, partially, and fully recanalized. Recurrent DVT cases were also recorded.\nThe study included 64 patients with 73 involved limbs; of which, skin damage was documented in three (4%) at 1 year and in 18 (25%) at 5 years (P = 0.0006; relative risk [RR], 3.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-11.3). Overall from 1 to 5 years, 50 limbs remained the same. A change in clinical class occurred in 23 limbs (31.5%), including five limbs that progressed from class 0 to 3, 15 limbs from class 3 to 4 and 6, and three from class 4 to 5 and 6. DU imaging of these 23 limbs progression showed that the most important predictor for class progression was ipsilateral recurrent DVT (RR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.4-13.3). Recurrent DVT at 1 year occurred in 21.9%, including ipsilateral in 15.6% and contralateral in 6.3%. Total recurrence at 5 years was 31.3%, including ipsilateral in 23.4% and contralateral in 7.8%. Limbs with ipsilateral recurrence were more likely to have partial recanalization, reflux, and more vein segments involved compared with those with contralateral recurrence or no recurrence (11 of 15 vs 16 of 58; RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.7-13.3).\nClinical class progression from year 1 to 5 occurs in 30% of post-thrombotic limbs. The most important predictor for progression in clinical class was ipsilateral recurrent DVT.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study investigated persistent reflux of the below knee great saphenous knee (GSV) 2 years after stripping the above knee GSV and the effect on reflux of postoperative incompetent perforating veins (IPVs).\nIncluded were 59 consecutive ambulatory patients in a community hospital with untreated primary varicose veins and reflux of the saphenofemoral junction and at least the GSV in the upper leg. Patients underwent a preoperative clinical examination and color flow duplex ultrasound imaging. Postoperative evaluations were at 6 months and 2 years, and 67 limbs were re-evaluable. This analysis was adjusted for age, CEAP, follow-up period, and preoperative reflux using a multivariate logistic regression model. The difference in diameter of the GSV below the knee before and after surgery was measured and tested with the paired t test.\nClearly visible varicose veins in the GSV below the knee were seen in 49 limbs (73%) before surgery and after surgery in 11 limbs (16%) at 6 months and in 15 limbs (22%) at 2 years. Reflux in the below knee main stem increased from 81% before surgery to 84% at 6 months and 91% at 2 years after surgery. Reflux in the posterior calf tributary of the GSV decreased from 67% before surgery to 64% at 6 months and 59% at 2 years after surgery. The mean diameter of the below knee GSV main stem decreased from 4.7 mm before surgery to 3.3 mm 6 months after surgery (P < .001), but increased to 3.6 mm 2 years after surgery (P < .05). The mean diameter of the posterior calf tributary of the GSV decreased from 3.5 mm before surgery to 2.7 mm at 6 months (P < .001), but increased to 2.9 mm at 2 years (P < .05). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression shows no association between reflux in one of the GSV below knee branches and postoperative IPVs.\nMany patients (91%) that undergo a short stripping procedure will have a persistent reflux of the remnant below knee GSV tributaries postoperatively. This incompetence of the distal GSV is independent from the proximal GSV as well from insufficient perforating veins. There seems to be a tendency to worsening of the clinical signs and symptoms between 6 months and 2 years after surgery, and this goes along with an increase of reflux and diameters of the GSV below knee remnants.",

    "abstract": "Initially, patients with a short angulated aortic neck were considered unfit for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Recently, however, more liberal use of EVAR has been advocated. This study analyzes the correlation of aortic neck length to early and late outcomes.\nWe analyzed 238 patients who underwent EVAR during a recent 7-year period. All patients were followed up clinically and underwent postoperative duplex ultrasound imaging or computed tomography angiography, which were repeated every 6 months. Aortic neck length was classified into >or=15 mm (L1, n = 195), 10 to <15 mm (L2, n = 24), and <10 mm (L3, n = 17). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate freedom from late endoleak, early and late reintervention, and survival.\nAnalyzed were 49 Ancure, 47 AneuRx, 104 Excluder, and 38 Zenith grafts. The mean follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1-87 months). The initial technical success was 99%. The perioperative complication rates for groups L1, L2, and L3 were 13%, 21%, and 24%, respectively (P = .289). Proximal type I early endoleaks occurred in 12%, 42%, and 53% in groups L1, L2, and L3, respectively (P < .001). Intraoperative proximal aortic cuffs were needed to seal proximal type I endoleaks in 10%, 38%, and 47% in L1, L2, and L3 groups, respectively (P < .0001). However, the rate of late reintervention was comparable in all groups. Postoperatively, the size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm decreased or remained unchanged in 95%, 94%, and 88% in L1, L2, and L3, respectively (P = .660). Rates of freedom from late type I endoleak at 1, 2, and 3 years were 84%, 82%, and 80% for L1; 68%, 54%, and 54% for L2; and 71%, 71%, and 53% for L3 (P = .0263).

    "abstract": "There are very few population-based studies of long-term outcomes after lower extremity (LE) bypass graft surgery. This study analyzes perioperative and long-term limb salvage and amputation-free survival outcomes for patients undergoing initial aortoiliac or femoropopliteal bypass graft surgery in California hospitals from 1996 to 1999.\nAdministrative data with encrypted identifiers were used to identify a chronologically first, index admission of all patients undergoing LE bypass procedures for occlusive disease from 1996 to 1999. A 1993 to 1995 look-back period was used to exclude patients who had undergone prior bypass surgery or amputation procedures. Patients with incident procedures were then followed forward to determine subsequent hospitalizations and vital status through 2004. The study comprised 28,128 patients discharged from 345 California hospitals with a median 61.5-month follow-up. Risk factors included demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, admission type, gangrene or ulceration, operation level, hospital LE bypass surgery volume, and year of discharge. Logistic regression was used to analyze 30-day outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze amputation-free survival.\nOverall 30-day mortality was 4.3, and the 30-day major amputation rate was 2.6%. Limb salvage was 81.9% at 5 years and 76.4% at 9 years. Amputation-free survival was 51.5% at 5 years and 34.1% at 9 years. Risk factors were generally similar for both perioperative and late outcomes. Advanced age, higher comorbidity level, gangrene, and emergency or nursing home admission conferred significantly greater risk. Hospital volume was associated with both perioperative and late outcomes. African American and Hispanic patients had much higher amputation rates but did not have higher mortality risk after controlling for baseline severity of illness.\nLong-term outcomes of LE bypass surgery were superior for high-volume hospital patients. Graft surveillance and risk factor follow-up care provide a major opportunity for quality improvement efforts. The contrast between traditional limb salvage and amputation-free survival outcomes raises questions about the value of surgical treatment, particularly for patients with limited life expectancy and without coding of tissue loss or critical limb ischemia.",

We examined the incidence of restenosis after RA-PTAS and associations with clinical factors.\nConsecutive patients undergoing RA-PTAS for hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS associated with hypertension or ischemic nephropathy, or both, between October 2003 and September 2007 were identified from a registry. Restenosis was defined using duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging as a renal artery postintervention peak systolic velocity (PSV) >or=180 cm/s. The incidence and temporal distribution of restenosis was analyzed using survival analysis based on treated kidneys. Associations between clinical factors and recurrent stenosis were examined using proportional hazards regression.\nRA-PTAS was performed on 112 kidneys for atherosclerotic RAS during the study period. Initial postintervention renal artery DUS imaging confirming PSV <180 cm/s in 101 kidneys, which formed the basis of this analysis. Estimated restenosis-free survival was 50% at 12 months and 40% at 18 months. Decreased risk of restenosis was associated with preoperative statin use (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.74; P = .006) and increased preoperative diastolic blood pressure (DBP; HR, 0.70 per 10-mm Hg increase in preoperative DBP; 95% CI, 0.49-0.99; P = .049). No other factors assessed were associated with restenosis.\nRestenosis occurs in a substantial number of patients treated with RA-PTAS. Preoperative statin medication use and increased preoperative DBP are associated with reduced risk of restenosis. In the absence of contraindications, statins should be considered standard therapy for patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.",

There were 21 females and 17 males with a mean age of 67 +/- 17 years (38-93 years) who had a total of 93 IPVs (40 calf; 53 ankle). Eighteen patients (47%) had ipsilateral great saphenous vein (GSV) radio-frequency closures performed prior to current procedure. The venous flow pattern was classified by spectral waveform analysis as \"normal\" (spontaneous with respiratory phasicity) in 33 patients and \"pulsatile\" (with bidirectional cardiac phasicity) in five patients. Follow-up duplex scans were performed from 3 to 7 days postprocedure. Statistical analyses were performed for determining correlation between the various factors such as, age, pulsatile flow, CEAP class, prior GSV ablation, vein diameter, reflux, and patency.\nThe mean number of ablated IPVs was 1.94 +/- 0.38 ranging from 1-3. Immediate success rate was 88% (82 cases, 32 patients). IPVs had a duplex measured mean diameter of 3.8 +/- 1.1 mm (2-6.6 mm). Eleven IPVs remained patent in six patients. There was no significant difference between the patent and the obliterated IPV groups concerning age (P = 0.75), prior GSV ablation (P = .19), IPV diameter (P = .08) and CEAP classification. Conversely, four of the five procedures (80%) performed in patients with \"pulsatile\" venous flow failed, while only two of the remaining 43 procedures (4.7%) in patients with \"normal\" venous flow failed (P < .001).\nThese data show that a pulsatile venous flow pattern is a significant predictor of failure following RFS for IPVs.",

    "abstract": "This study used a large national administrative in-hospital database to compare utilization and age-specific outcomes between open repair (OAR) and endovascular (EVAR) repair for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nDischarges with the principal International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes for EVAR and OAR and principal diagnosis code of intact AAAs were selected from the 2001 to 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Weighted least-square regression was used to test the trend of utilization by age. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the risk-adjusted outcomes.\nNationally, the estimated number of elective AAAs treated with EVAR increased from 11,171 in 2001 to 21,725 in 2006 (P = .003). The number of elective AAAs treated with OAR declined from 17,784 to 8451 during the same period (P < .001). By 2006, EVAR was more frequently used than OAR for patients of all ages. Compared with the younger age groups, patients aged >or=85 years had a significant increase in the total number of asymptomatic AAA repairs, driven almost entirely by an increase in the use of EVAR. Compared with open patients, EVAR patients had a significantly shorter length of hospitalization (adjusted mean, 2.99 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.97-3.01] vs 8.78 days [95% CI, 8.53-8.57]), less in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.19-0.28), fewer in-hospital complications (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.25-0.28), and a higher likelihood of being discharged to home (OR, 3.95; 95% CI, 3.62-4.31). The reduction of complications from the use of EVAR versus OAR was most dramatic for the oldest patients.\nAs short-term surgical outcomes are consistently improving for patients undergoing AAA repair, elective EVAR has replaced OAR as the more common method of repair in the United States. The introduction of this technology has been rapidly adopted, particularly for the oldest-old surgical patients, aged >or=85 years, who previously may not have been offered surgical intervention for asymptomatic AAA. Further investigation is necessary to examine whether this trend improves the long-term survival and quality of life for this elderly population.",

The number of elective AAAs treated with OAR declined from 17,784 to 8451 during the same period (P < .001). By 2006, EVAR was more frequently used than OAR for patients of all ages. Compared with the younger age groups, patients aged >or=85 years had a significant increase in the total number of asymptomatic AAA repairs, driven almost entirely by an increase in the use of EVAR. Compared with open patients, EVAR patients had a significantly shorter length of hospitalization (adjusted mean, 2.99 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.97-3.01] vs 8.78 days [95% CI, 8.53-8.57]), less in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.19-0.28), fewer in-hospital complications (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.25-0.28), and a higher likelihood of being discharged to home (OR, 3.95; 95% CI, 3.62-4.31). The reduction of complications from the use of EVAR versus OAR was most dramatic for the oldest patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) is associated with a decreased incidence of perioperative cardiac complications compared with open repair. However, EVAR is not associated with long-term survival benefit. This study assessed the effect of perioperative asymptomatic cardiac damage after EVAR on long-term prognosis.\nIn 220 patients undergoing elective EVAR, routine sampling for levels of cardiac troponin T and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed on days 1, 3, and 7 during the patient's hospital stay. Elevated cardiac troponin T was defined as serum concentrations >or=0.01 ng/mL. Asymptomatic cardiac damage was defined as cardiac troponin T release without symptoms or ECG changes. The median follow-up was 2.9 years. Survival status was obtained by contacting the Office of Civil Registry.\nRelease of cardiac troponin T (median, 0.08 ng/mL) occurred in 24 of 220 patients, of whom 20 (83%) were asymptomatic and without ECG changes. Patients with asymptomatic cardiac damage had a mortality rate of 49% [corrected] after 2.9 years vs 15% [corrected] for patients without perioperative cardiac damage (P < .001). Also after adjustment for clinical risk factors and medication use applying multivariate Cox regression analysis, asymptomatic cardiac damage was associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk for death (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.1). Statin use was associated with a reduced long-term risk for death (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9).\nAsymptomatic cardiac damage in patients undergoing EVAR is associated with poor long-term outcome. Routine perioperative cardiac screening after EVAR might be warranted.",

    "abstract": "In the decision for surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the maximum diameter is the main factor. Several studies have concluded that the diameter may not be reliable as rupture risk criterion for the individual patient and wall stress was found to have a higher sensitivity and specificity. The AAA wall stress may also be an influential factor in growth of the AAA. This study investigates the effect of intraluminal thrombus on the wall stress and growth rate of aneurysms, using both idealized and patient-specific AAA models in wall stress computations.\nIdealized AAA models were created for wall stress analysis. Thrombus was modeled as an incompressible linear elastic material and was fixed to the wall. The reduction in wall stress for a range of thrombus volumes and shear moduli was computed. For 30 patient-specific AAA models with varying thrombus volumes, the wall stress was computed with and without thrombus. The diameter growth rate was compared for AAAs with a small and large thrombus volume. The results were compared between the idealized and patient-specific models.\nThe thrombus caused a reduction in wall stress, which was stronger for larger thrombi and higher elastic moduli. Any AAAs with a large thrombus were found to have significant stronger growth in diameter than aneurysms with a small thrombus (P < .01). The stress reduction due to the thrombus showed the same trend for the idealized and patient-specific models, although the effect was overestimated by the idealized models and a considerable variation between patients was observed.\nA larger thrombus in AAA was associated with a higher AAA growth rate, but also with a lower wall stress. Therefore, weakening of the AAA wall, under the influence of thrombus, may play a more imminent role in the process of AAA growth than the stress acting on the wall.",

    "abstract": "Using 30-day operative mortality reported with lower extremity bypass (LEB) in preoperative decision making may underestimate the actual death rate encountered before patients have truly recovered from surgery, especially in elderly, debilitated patients with significant tissue loss. Therefore, we examined preoperative, patient-level risk factors that predict survival within the first year following LEB.\nUsing our regional quality improvement initiative in 11 hospitals in Northern New England, we studied 2306 LEB procedures performed in 2031 patients between January 2003 and December 2007. Sixty surgeons contributed to our database, and over 100 demographic and clinical variables were abstracted by trained researchers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HR) and surrounding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for our combined outcome measure of death occurring within the first year postoperatively.\nWe found that within our cohort of 2306 bypass procedures, 11% of patients died within 1 year of surgery (2% prior to discharge, 9% prior to 1-year follow-up). We identified six preoperative patient characteristics associated with higher risk of death in multivariate analysis: congestive heart failure (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), critical limb ischemia (CLI) (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.4), lack of single-segment saphenous vein (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2/5), age over 80 (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), dialysis dependence (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-3.6), and emergent nature of the procedure (HR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.8). While patients with no risk factors had 1-year death rates that were less than 5%: patients with three or more risk factors had a 28% chance of dying before 1 year postoperatively. When we compared risk-adjusted survival across centers, we found that one center in our region performed significantly better than expected (observed-to-expected outcome ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9, P = .04).\nPreoperative risk factors allow surgeons to predict survival in the first year following LEB, and to more precisely inform patients about their operative risk with LEB. Additionally, our model facilitates benchmarking comparison of risk-adjusted outcomes across our region. We believe quality improvement measures such as these will allow surgeons to identify best practices and thereby improve outcomes with LEB across centers.",

We identified six preoperative patient characteristics associated with higher risk of death in multivariate analysis: congestive heart failure (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), critical limb ischemia (CLI) (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.4), lack of single-segment saphenous vein (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2/5), age over 80 (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), dialysis dependence (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-3.6), and emergent nature of the procedure (HR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.8). While patients with no risk factors had 1-year death rates that were less than 5%: patients with three or more risk factors had a 28% chance of dying before 1 year postoperatively. When we compared risk-adjusted survival across centers, we found that one center in our region performed significantly better than expected (observed-to-expected outcome ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9, P = .04).",

    "abstract": "Limited endothelial cell (EC) coverage and anastomotic intimal hyperplasia contribute to thrombosis and failure of prosthetic grafts. Lipid accumulation and lipid oxidation are associated with decreased EC migration and intimal hyperplasia. The goal of this study was to assess the ability of antioxidants to improve graft healing in hypercholesterolemic animals.\nRabbits were placed in one of four groups: chow plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC), chow plus probucol, chow with 1% cholesterol plus NAC, or chow with 1% cholesterol plus probucol. After 2 weeks, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (12 cm long x 4-mm internal diameter) were implanted in the abdominal aorta. Grafts were removed after 6 weeks and analyzed for cholesterol content, EC coverage, anastomotic intimal thickness, and the cellular composition of the neointima. Plasma samples were obtained to assess systemic oxidative stress. The data were compared with previously reported data from animals fed diets of chow and chow with 1% cholesterol.\nProsthetic grafts from rabbits fed chow with 1% cholesterol had significantly greater anastomotic intimal thickening and lower EC coverage than grafts from rabbits fed a regular chow diet. In hypercholesterolemic rabbits, antioxidant therapy decreased global oxidative stress as evidenced by a 40% decrease in plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In rabbits fed the chow with 1% cholesterol diet, NAC decreased intimal hyperplasia at the proximal anastomosis by 29% and significantly increased graft EC coverage from 46% to 71% (P = .03). Following a similar pattern, probucol decreased intimal hyperplasia by 43% and increased graft EC coverage to 53% in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.\nGlobal oxidative stress and anastomotic intimal hyperplasia are increased, and endothelialization of prosthetic grafts is significantly reduced in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet. Antioxidant treatment improves EC coverage and decreases intimal hyperplasia. Reducing oxidative stress may promote healing of prosthetic grafts.",

    "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) advised little benefit from surgery in women because of high operative risk. Whether these findings are also applicable to carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is subject of investigation. Our aim was to determine the risk of perioperative and late complications related to CAS and CEA in women.\nData from a single-center carotid surgery database including 1065 individuals with CAS (306 women and 759 men) and 1131 with CEA (325 women and 806 men) were analyzed in a consecutive series of patients. Perioperative risks of death, stroke, and local complications in women undergoing CAS and CEA were compared. Rates of restenosis >50% and stroke at 5 years in symptomatic and asymptomatic women were also assessed.\nThe perioperative risks of stroke or death were no different in women who underwent CAS and CEA women (1.9% vs 3.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-1.7; P = .45) whether they were symptomatic or not. Other perioperative complications were also similarly distributed between the two groups of women. Life-table estimates of any periprocedural stroke/death and ipsilateral stroke at 5 years after the procedure did not differ between women with CAS and CEA (4.1% vs 8.1%; P = .18). Five-year rates of restenosis >50% were nonsignificantly higher in women after CEA than after CAS (1.8% vs 8.1%; P = .058).\nWomen with carotid stenosis might have favorable early and late outcomes from CAS with complication rates similar and even lower than those attained with CEA. CAS, performed by trained operators, may be a valid primary choice for treatment of carotid stenosis, particularly in asymptomatic women for whom the risk of surgery seems to be higher. However, before claiming CAS for women, these results need to be confirmed by large RCTs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate endoleak classification is essential following fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (f-EVAR). Both endoleak type and exact source of endoleak have implications upon the urgency and complexity of future management strategies. Herein we report on a patient with a documented endoleak post-f-EVAR, in which the source of blood flow into the aneurysm sac could not be determined using conventional computed tomographic angiography. Consequently, dynamic volumetric computed tomographic angiography (DV-CTA) was employed, which clearly illustrated the site of origin of the endoleak. DV-CTA enables accurate endoleak characterization following f-EVAR, with excellent conspicuity of the source of blood flow into the aneurysm sac.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent public health problem associated with major detrimental effects on quality of life and functional status, and it is also the main cause of limb amputation. More importantly, PAD has been classified as a coronary artery disease equivalent, meaning that patients with a diagnosis of PAD carry a risk for major coronary events equal to that of established coronary artery disease. PAD is also a potent predictor of stroke and death. Despite its frequent occurrence (8 to 10 million Americans are affected), little is known about the natural history of PAD in racial/ethnic minorities, particularly in Hispanics, who represent 12.5% of the United States population. Furthermore, the disease is commonly underdiagnosed and undertreated in this minority group, and outcomes are poorer in Hispanics as compared with whites. Limited access to health care, difficulties for recruitment in population-based studies, and limitations of the noninvasive screening tests are well-established barriers to determine the prevalence and natural history of PAD in Hispanics. Although the most widely used test for assessment of patients at risk for PAD is the ankle-brachial index (ABI), the test has substantial limitations in individuals with diabetes and arterial calcification, which are highly prevalent in Hispanics. The ABI should, therefore, be supplemented by the use of other noninvasive tests, such as the pulse volume recordings (PVR) and toe-brachial index. Besides the use of a combination of diagnostic techniques, the implementation of a research methodology that improves recruitment of Hispanics in population-based studies is necessary to obtain better knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease in this group. Community-based participatory research may be the most appropriate approach to study this ethnic minority because it overcomes barriers for limited access to health care and increases the possibility of overcoming distrust of research on the part of communities. Understanding the epidemiology of PAD to improve its detection and treatment among Hispanics is relevant to reduce disparities in the health status of this group, the most rapidly growing ethnic minority in the United States.",

    "abstract": "The mortality of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) has decreased 3.5% per decade in the last 50 years to a current rate of 40%-50%. Reports have indicated that endovascular repair (EVAR) is feasible for rAAA and may offer potential benefits over open repair. We examined the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to compare 30-day multicenter outcomes for EVAR vs open rAAA repair.\nPatients that underwent rAAA repair in the NSQIP database from 2005 to 2007 were identified through a combination of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses. Preoperative comorbidities, operative duration and transfusion, and 30 day outcomes were evaluated using t tests or Chi-squared tests depending on the variable. A separate multivariable regression was performed for each outcome adjusting for all independently predictive preoperative and intraoperative risk factors.\nA total of 427 patients were identified and 76.8% of patients underwent open repair. The open repair groups exhibited lower albumin levels and higher percentage of patients with preoperative hematocrit (Hct) <38% and need for preoperative ventilation. The requirement for preoperative blood transfusion was similar. Patients undergoing open repair had much higher intraoperative transfusion requirements (11.8 +/- 8.9 vs 4.2 +/- 6.0 red blood cell units, P < .001). After adjustment for preoperative mortality risk factors, the mortality risk was higher for open repair versus EVAR (odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-3.05, P = .096) but did not reach significance. After similar adjustment the composite morbidity odds ratio for open repair versus EVAR was 1.82 (95% CI 1.11-2.99, P = .018) and the pulmonary adverse events odds ratio was 1.99 (95% CI 1.22-3.25, P = .006). Risks for the other outcomes were not significant.\nComposite 30-day morbidity risk is lower after EVAR vs open repair of rAAA. Open repair is associated with increased transfusion requirements. Performance of EVAR in rAAA patients with favorable anatomy could potentially result in improved outcome as compared with open repair.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade, there has been a sharp increase in the number of vascular procedures performed in the United States. Due to the increase in the size of the aging population, this trend is predicted to continue. Despite this, general public knowledge about vascular surgery appears low. This gap may significantly affect the success of vascular surgery as a specialty. To objectively define knowledge about vascular surgery, we administered a questionnaire to both a sample of the general population and medical students. The Vascular Surgery Knowledge Questionnaire (VSQ), a 58-item multiple choice survey, was designed to assess knowledge about the field of vascular surgery, including types of procedures commonly performed, presenting illnesses, training, and financial compensation. VSQ was tested for reliability and validity. It was administered to a sample of the general population (GP) and first year medical students (MS) via a random digit dial telephone survey and a paper-based survey, respectively. VSQ Score was derived by calculating the percent of questions from the 38-item, non-demographic part of the questionnaire answered correctly and expressed in numerical form. The maximum score possible was 100. Statistical analysis was used to assess differences in VSQ scores. Two hundred GP and 160 MS subjects completed the questionnaire. The mean VSQ score for GP and MS groups was 54 and 67 (P < .01), respectively. Forty-one percent of the GP group received a score of less than 50. Only 50% of the GP and 51% of MS cohorts agreed with the statement that vascular surgeons perform procedures on all blood vessels with the exception of the heart and brain. Just 24% of the GP group agreed with the statement that vascular surgeons treat patients with wounds that do not heal. Finally, only half of the GP group agreed that vascular surgeons treat patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The GP cohort significantly underestimated the average length of postgraduate training (five years) to become a vascular surgeon. Level of education, income, and residence in the Western states significantly correlated with higher scores. General population subjects who admitted to knowing a vascular surgeon received similar scores to those who did not (58 vs. 53, P >.05). These findings support our hypothesis that there is a significant knowledge deficit among both the general population and medical students about the field of vascular surgery. This has protean implications for the future of our specialty and public health in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Although technical success of renal artery stenting (RAS) is high and adverse events are infrequent, clinical success (improved blood pressure and renal function) and durability have been less predictable. Identifying those patients who will respond to RAS could improve overall outcomes of the procedure.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent RAS for treatment of renovascular hypertension (RVH) between 2001 and 2007 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The primary outcome measure was blood pressure improvement or cure as judged by American Heart Association criteria. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), number of antihypertensive medications, and survival were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with blood pressure improvement at the last follow-up.\nDuring the 6-year period, 129 patients (179 renal arteries) underwent stent placement for RVH. Procedural complications occurred nine patients (7.0%). Average length follow-up was 1.5 years. Follow-up data were obtained in 122 patients (95%). At last follow-up, there were significant improvements in systolic blood pressure (161 vs 144 mm Hg, P < .001), diastolic blood pressure (80 vs 73 mm Hg, P < .001), and number of antihypertensive medications (3.1 vs 2.8, P = .034). The eGFR was improved in 16% of patients, stable in 60%, and worse in 24%. By multivariate analysis, a baseline eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.9; P = .02) and female gender (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P = .04) were independent predictors of failure to achieve blood pressure improvement. By 2 and 4 years of follow-up, sustained blood pressure improvement was present in 67% of patients with a baseline eGFR of > or = 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 and in 31% of patients with a baseline eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2. During 2 years of follow-up, survival was similar between patients with sustained blood pressure response and those without.\nPatients treated for RVH who have a baseline eGFR of > or = 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 demonstrate a better response to RAS at each follow-up interval, with a significant difference at 2 to 4 years, compared with patients with an eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate exposure to and knowledge of vascular surgery obtained during medical school that could affect career decisions.\nA survey was conducted of recent medical school graduates entering military residency programs. Questions were designed to ascertain the medical school attended and degree obtained, exposure to and perception of vascular surgery, and basic vascular surgery knowledge.\nOf 316 individuals who were identified and sent surveys, 218 (69%) responded. There were 131 allopathic graduates (60%), 87 (40%) osteopathic graduates, and 53 (25%) were entering a surgical residency. Clinical clerkships (32%) were the primary reason for specialty selection, followed by lifestyle (29%). Most respondents (66%) did not have a vascular clinical clerkship. Regarding perception, 56% of respondents would consult interventional radiology for a peripheral arteriogram vs vascular surgery (39%). The mean score of the knowledge-based questions was 69%. Incoming postgraduate year (PGY) 1 surgical residents had a statistically higher mean score on the knowledge portion (P < .001). In addition, a positive correlation was noted with the number of weeks spent on a surgical (P < .03) and a vascular surgical (P < .001) rotation and the mean score.

    "abstract": "The contribution of hereditary and environmental factors to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is still partly unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of these factors in a large population-based sample of twins.\nThe Swedish Twin Registry, containing data on twins born in the country since 1886, was cross-linked with the Inpatient Registry, providing national coverage of discharge diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). All twins with an infrarenal AAA were identified. Concordance rates and tetrachoric correlations were calculated for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Tetrachoric correlations were calculated assuming an underlying normal distribution of liability, with multiple factors contributing additively and a threshold value that discriminates between AAA and no AAA. Higher concordance rates and correlations of liability in MZ twins than in DZ twins suggest that genetic factors influence disease development. Structural equation modeling techniques, Mx-analyses, were used to estimate the contributions of genetic effects as well as shared and nonshared environmental factors for development of AAA.\nThere were 172,890 twins registered at the time of the study including 265 twins (81% men; mean age 72 years; range, 48-94) with AAA. There were 7 MZ and 5 DZ concordant pairs as well as 44 MZ and 197 DZ discordant pairs with AAA. The probandwise concordance rates for MZ and DZ pairs were 24% and 4.8%, respectively. The tetrachoric correlations were 0.71 in MZ pairs and 0.31 in DZ pairs. The odds ratio (OR) was 71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 27-183) for MZ twins and 7.6 (95% CI 3.0-19) for DZ twins. In the structural equation models, genetic effects accounted for 70% (95% CI 0.33-0.83), shared environmental effects for 0% (95% CI 0-0.27), and nonshared environmental effects for 30% (95% CI 0.17-0.46) of the phenotypic variance among twins.\nThese data provide robust epidemiologic evidence that heritability contributes to aneurysm formation. Concordances and correlations were higher in MZ compared with DZ twins, indicating genetic effects. There was a 24% probability that an MZ twin of a person with AAA will have the disease. The twin of an MZ twin with AAA had a risk of AAA that was 71 times that of the MZ twin of a person without AAA. A heritability of 70% of the total trait variance was estimated. The remaining variance was explained by nonshared environmental factors with no support for a role of shared environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the outcomes of reinforcing anastomotic sites using (1) nonbiodegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt, (2) biodegradable polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt, and (3) PGA felt with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in a canine descending thoracic aortic replacement model.\nThirty-seven beagles underwent descending thoracic aorta replacement using a prosthetic graft with one of the above-mentioned reinforcements or no reinforcement for controls. Histologic evaluations were carried out 1 month and 3 months after surgery. The biomechanical strength of the anastomosis was assessed along the longitudinal axis of the aortic segments using a tensile tester. Local compliance at the anastomotic site was also evaluated in the circumferential direction.\nThe media was significantly thinner in the PTFE group than in the control group (65.8% +/- 5.1% vs 95.0% +/- 9.3% of normal thickness; P < .05). Relative to the control group, the adventitial layer was significantly thinner in the PTFE group (42.3% +/- 8.2% of control; P < .05) but significantly thicker in the PGA and the PGA + bFGF groups (117.2% +/- 11.3% and 134.1% +/- 14.2% of control, respectively; P < .05). There were more vessels in the adventitial layer in the PGA + bFGF group than in the control, PTFE, and PGA groups (29.2 +/- 2.1/mm(2) vs 13.8 +/- 0.8, 5.4 +/- 0.7, 17.0 +/- 1.3/mm(2), respectively; P < .01). There were no significant differences between the four groups in the failure force at anastomotic sites. Local compliance at the anastomotic site was higher in the PGA group than that in the PTFE group (11.6 +/- 1.6 10(-6) m(2)/N vs 5.6 +/- 1.9 10(-6) m(2)/N; P < .05).\nReinforcement of the experimental aortic wall with PTFE felt resulted in thinning of the media and adventitia and fewer vessels at the anastomotic site. These histologic changes were not observed when biodegradable felt was used. The bFGF failed to augment the modification of the aortic wall with the exception of increased adventitial vessel number. Biomechanical strength of the anastomosis along the longitudinal axis was comparable in all four groups; however, local vascular compliance was better in the biodegradable PGA felt group.",

These histologic changes were not observed when biodegradable felt was used. The bFGF failed to augment the modification of the aortic wall with the exception of increased adventitial vessel number. Biomechanical strength of the anastomosis along the longitudinal axis was comparable in all four groups; however, local vascular compliance was better in the biodegradable PGA felt group.",

    "abstract": "To develop a set of suggested objective performance goals (OPG) for evaluating new catheter-based treatments in critical limb ischemia (CLI), based on evidence from historical controls.\nRandomized, controlled trials of surgical, endovascular, and pharmacologic/biologic treatments for CLI were reviewed according to specified criteria regarding study population and data quality. Line-item data were obtained for selected studies from the sponsor/funding agency. A set of specific outcome measures was defined in accordance with the treatment goals for the CLI population. Risk factors were examined for their influence on key endpoints, and models of stratification based on specific clinical and anatomic variables developed. Sample size estimates were made for single-arm trial designs based on comparison to the suggested OPG.\nBypass with autogenous vein was considered the established standard, and data compiled from three individual randomized, controlled trials (N = 838) was analyzed. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as perioperative (30-day) death or any major adverse limb event (amputation or major reintervention) occurring within one year. Results of open surgery controls demonstrated freedom from the primary endpoint in 76.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74.0%-79.9%) of patients at one year, with amputation-free survival (AFS) of 76.5% (95% CI 73.7%-79.5). An additional 3% non-inferiority margin was suggested in generating OPG for catheter-based therapies. Defined clinical (age > 80 years and tissue loss) and anatomic (infra-popliteal anatomy or lack of good quality saphenous vein) risk subgroups provided significantly different point estimates and OPG threshold values.\nFor new catheter-based therapies in CLI, OPGs offer a feasible approach for pre-market evaluation using non-randomized trial designs. Such studies should incorporate risk stratification in design and reporting as the CLI population is heterogeneous with respect to baseline variables and expected outcomes. Guidelines for CLI trial design to address consistency in study cohorts, methods of assessment, and endpoint definitions are provided.",

This article identifies a number of key challenges with conducting and comparing CLI trials, including the wide spectrum of clinical presentations that CLI encompasses, the use of disparate eligibility criteria and endpoint measurements, and logistical and economic considerations that can limit study initiation and completion. The authors propose definitions for a number of performance goals derived from historical surgical literature as a means of reducing the negative impact of these factors.

These single-armed comparisons may facilitate rapid entry of novel devices to the market.

    "abstract": "Health economic arguments have become increasingly important in clinical decision making, especially when new treatment modalities are introduced. This study reviews the methods used in health economic reports of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and uses original cost data to study how different methods affect interpretation of results in terms of cost differences and economic efficiency.\nPublications referenced in PubMed from 2003 to 2008 studying cost of AAA repair were reviewed. Original population-based cost data of AAA repair were analyzed, comparing open (OR) and endovascular repair (EVAR). Means, medians, and cost distributions were calculated, and differences were analyzed with four different statistical methods.\nThe review showed a mixture of statistical methods used in AAA treatment cost-comparison studies. Presentation of cost data and inclusion criteria varied between studies. The analysis of original data showed skewed distribution of cost data, with large differences between mean and median cost. Although mean values indicated a lower total, perioperative, and postoperative cost for EVAR, the median values indicated OR was the least costly method. Exclusion of extreme values lowered mean perioperative cost of OR by 10%, while cost of EVAR was unaffected. Inferential testing of cost differences by means of four statistical methods showed that P values were highly dependent on test methodology.\nConclusions of health economic reports can be highly dependent on how the data are presented and the statistical methods that are used. We recommend that cost data be presented as mean values with distributions. Exclusion of outliers and focus on P values should be avoided.",

    "abstract": "Open revascularization in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is considered the gold standard. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) is often reserved for patients not suitable for open revascularization. In our institute, endovascular revascularization is the first-choice treatment. The purpose of this study was to report the technical and clinical success rates after endovascular revascularization as the first-choice treatment in a series of 51 consecutive patients with CMI at a single tertiary vascular referral center.\nA retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients with CMI who underwent PTAS from July 2001 to July 2008. Only symptomatic patients treated for atherosclerotic CMI were included. Patency was evaluated using computed tomography angiography (CTA). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate patency rates of the treated mesenteric arteries.\nSixty mesenteric arteries (30 celiac trunks, 24 superior mesenteric, and 6 inferior mesenteric arteries) were treated in 51 patients (26 men). Major morbidity was 4%. After dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (n = 1) and brachial artery (n = 1), respectively, both patients underwent endarterectomy and patch plasty. In three arteries, the lesion could not be crossed endovascularly and they were deemed immediate intention-to-treat failures. The initial technical success rate was 93%. No 30-day mortality was observed. Median follow-up was 25 months. During follow-up, 2 patients died from intestinal ischemia. Complete symptom relief was achieved in 78% of patients. Primary 1- and 2-year patency rates were 86% +/- 5% and 60% +/- 9%, respectively; primary-assisted patency rates were 88% +/- 5% and 79% +/- 7%, respectively. During follow-up, 6 patients underwent open revascularization due to failure of PTAS.\nThe initial technical success rate of PTAS as first-choice treatment of CMI is >90%. The 2-year primary patency rate dropped to 60%, but symptomatic in-stent stenoses could often be treated successfully with renewed endovascular techniques.

In July 2007, we implemented an algorithm to promote endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) when feasible. This report describes the outcome with this approach.\nData on patients presenting with rAAA between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2007, were reviewed and used for comparison to prospectively collected data. Data on patients presenting between July 1, 2007, and April 30, 2009, were collected on all patients after implementation of a structured protocol. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a log-rank test were performed to compare survival times for three groups (pre-protocol, post-protocol with open surgery, and post-protocol with EVAR).\nDuring the study period, 187 patients with rAAA presented to our institution. Before implementation of the algorithm, 131 patients with rAAA presented and 128 were treated. The 30-day mortality rate was 57.8%. After implementation of the protocol, 56 patients with rAAA were managed. Twenty-seven patients (48%) underwent successful EVAR, and 24 patients (43%) underwent open repair. Five patients (9%) underwent comfort care only. In the post-protocol period, 5 patients in the EVAR group (18.5%) and 13 patients in the open group (54.2%) died during the follow-up period for an overall 30-day mortality rate of 35.3% (P = .008 vs 57.8% pre-protocol). After implementation of a structured protocol for managing rAAA, there was a relative risk reduction in 30-day mortality of 35% compared to the time before implementation of the protocol (95% confidence interval [CI], 14%-51%) corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 22.5% (95% CI, 6.8%-38.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20-0.78; P = .007). After adjusting for key factors predicting mortality, the odds ratio is 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P = .001).\nUse of an algorithm favoring endovascular repair resulted in a highly significant reduction in rAAA mortality in our urban hospital. Thirty-day mortality for open repair was no different between pre- and post-protocol eras. With modern techniques of resuscitation and surgical management, a majority of patients presenting with rAAA can survive.",

The 30-day mortality rate was 57.8%. After implementation of the protocol, 56 patients with rAAA were managed. Twenty-seven patients (48%) underwent successful EVAR, and 24 patients (43%) underwent open repair. Five patients (9%) underwent comfort care only. In the post-protocol period, 5 patients in the EVAR group (18.5%) and 13 patients in the open group (54.2%) died during the follow-up period for an overall 30-day mortality rate of 35.3% (P = .008 vs 57.8% pre-protocol). After implementation of a structured protocol for managing rAAA, there was a relative risk reduction in 30-day mortality of 35% compared to the time before implementation of the protocol (95% confidence interval [CI], 14%-51%) corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 22.5% (95% CI, 6.8%-38.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20-0.78; P = .007). After adjusting for key factors predicting mortality, the odds ratio is 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P = .001).",

    "abstract": "The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs. Stenting Trial (CREST) completed randomization on July 18, 2008. Sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the trial has enrolled 2,522 participants across North America and is the largest randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). It is also the largest RCT to assess carotid revascularization in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis. Conventional-risk patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (> or =50% by angiography, > or =70% by ultrasound) or asymptomatic carotid stenosis (> or =60% by angiography, > or =70% by ultrasound) were randomized to both treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. Eligibility criteria for CREST were similar to those of the previous NINDS-sponsored CEA RCTs. The investigational devices used in the CAS arm of the study are the RX Acculink stent and the RX Accunet embolic protection system, (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif). The primary aim is to contrast the efficacy of CAS versus CEA in preventing stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality during a 30-day peri-procedural period, and ipsilateral stroke over the follow-up period (extending up to four years). The secondary aims are to contrast the efficacy of CAS and CEA in men and women, the restenosis rates of the two procedures, health-related quality of life, and cost effectiveness of CAS and CEA. The conclusion of enrollment in CREST marks the end of a long recruitment period from 117 community and academic hospital centers across the United States and Canada. Each surgeon and interventionalist underwent a rigorous credentialing process that included performance-assessment of prior CEA and CAS procedures. Credentialing of interventionalists also included a review of additional CAS procedures enrolled into a CREST lead-in phase prior to entering patients into the randomized trial; 1564 patients were enrolled in the lead-in, the final pathway for the largest credentialing effort to date for any clinical trial. CREST will provide long-term follow-up after carotid revascularization based on systematic ultrasonographic and neurologic surveillance, and on quality of life and cost-effectiveness comparisons between CAS and CEA in the setting of a RCT. We present a brief description of the CREST protocol, impediments that were overcome during the trial, salient results from the lead-in phase of the trial, a summary of enrollment activities and characteristics of the final cohort, and a timeline for anticipated results from the randomized phase.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endografts (stent grafts) have emerged as a less invasive modality to treat various thoracic aortic lesions. The intentional coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) during the placement of these endografts is associated with several complications including stroke, spinal cord ischemia, and arm ischemia. In this review, we synthesize the available evidence regarding the complications associated with LSA coverage.\nWe searched electronic databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) from January 1990 through February 2008 for studies that included patients who received thoracic endografts and had intentional LSA coverage. Eligible studies had a control group that either received the endograft without LSA coverage or had primary revascularization prior to coverage. Two independent reviewers determined trial eligibility and extracted descriptive, methodological and outcome data from each eligible study. Meta-analyses estimated Peto odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe the strength of association between coverage and complications; the I(2) statistic described the proportion of inconsistency of treatment effect among studies not due to chance.\nWe found 51 eligible observational studies. LSA coverage was associated with significant increase in the risk of arm ischemia (OR 47.7; CI, 9.9-229.3; I(2) = 72%, 19 studies) and vertebrobasilar ischemia (OR 10.8; CI, 3.17-36.7; I(2) = 0%; eight studies); and nonsignificant increase in the risk of spinal cord ischemia (OR 2.69; CI, 0.75-9.68; I(2) = 40%; eight studies) and anterior circulation stroke (OR 2.58; CI, 0.82-8.09; I(2) = 64%, 13 studies). There were no significant associations between LSA coverage and death, myocardial infarction, or transient ischemic attacks. The incidence of phrenic nerve injury as a complication of primary revascularization was 4.40% (CI, 1.60%-12.20%). Data on perioperative infection were sparse and rarely reported.\nVery low quality evidence suggests that LSA coverage increases the risk of arm ischemia, vertebrobasilar ischemia, and possibly spinal cord ischemia and anterior circulation stroke.",

In formulating clinical practice guidelines, the society selected a panel of experts and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. They used the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) method to develop and present their recommendations. The overall quality of evidence was very low. The committee issued three recommendations. Recommendation 1: In patients who need elective TEVAR where achievement of a proximal seal necessitates coverage of the left subclavian artery, we suggest routine preoperative revascularization, despite the very low-quality evidence (GRADE 2, level C). Recommendation 2: In selected patients who have an anatomy that compromises perfusion to critical organs, routine preoperative LSA revascularization is strongly recommended, despite the very low-quality evidence (GRADE 1, level C). Recommendation 3: In patients who need urgent TEVAR for life-threatening acute aortic syndromes where achievement of a proximal seal necessitates coverage of the left subclavian artery, we suggest that revascularization should be individualized and addressed expectantly on the basis of anatomy, urgency, and availability of surgical expertise (GRADE 2, level C).",

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation plays an important role in the development of postangioplasty or in-stent restenosis, venous graft failure, and atherosclerosis. Our previous work has demonstrated S-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2), an F-box subunit of SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase, as an important mediator and common final pathway for growth factors, extracellular matrices, and cyclic-nucleotides to regulate VSMC proliferation in vitro. However, whether alteration of Skp2 function also regulates VSMC proliferation in vivo and neointimal thickening postvascular injury remains unclear. We investigated the effect of Skp2 on VSMC proliferation and neointimal formation in vivo.\nFirstly, we demonstrated that Skp2-null mice developed significantly smaller neointimal areas than wild-type mice after carotid ligation. Secondly, to further identify a local rather than a systemic effect of Skp2 alteration, we demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant-negative Skp2 in the balloon-injured rat carotid artery significantly increased medial p27(Kip1) levels, inhibited VSMC proliferation, and the subsequent neointimal thickening. Lastly, to determine if Skp2 alone is sufficient to drive VSMC proliferation and lesion development in vivo, we demonstrated that adenovirus-delivery of wild-type Skp2 to the minimally-injured rat carotids is sufficient to downregulate p27(Kip1) protein levels, enhanced medial VSMC proliferation, and the neointimal thickening.\nThis data provides, we believe for the first time, a more comprehensive understanding of Skp2 in the regulation of VSMC proliferation and neointimal formation and suggests that Skp2 is a promising target in the treatment of vasculoproliferative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in the obese, often with severe clinical manifestations, is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. The association has drawn special interest as the pathophysiology may be different from that seen in the non-obese. The disease poses special management problems in the obese as traditional conservative measures are seldom effective. Iliac-caval venous stenting has been effective in CVI management but applicability in the obese raises concerns regarding stent compression, morbidity and efficacy.\nResults of iliac-caval stenting in 101 limbs of 87 patients are presented. Clinical features, venous test results, and outcome after stenting are reported with comparison to select relevant features in the non-obese limbs (n = 1513) that were stented over the same 11 year period.\nBilateral clinical manifestations CVI were twice as common in the obese subset compared with the non-obese (28% vs 14% respectively, P = .0007), the incidence increasing with BMI. Resting and exercise femoral vein pressures were similar to the non-obese.

    "abstract": "Varicose vein recurrence of the great saphenous vein (GSV) is a common, costly, and complex problem. The aim of the study was to assess feasibility of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in recurrent varicose veins of the GSV and to compare this technique with conventional surgical reintervention.\nCase files of all patients treated for GSV varicosities were evaluated and recurrences selected. Demographics, duplex scan findings, CEAP classification, perioperative data, and follow-up examinations were all registered. A questionnaire focusing on patient satisfaction was administered.\nSixty-seven limbs were treated with EVLA and 149 were surgically treated. General and regional anesthesia were used more in the surgery group (P < .001). Most complications were minor and self-limiting. Wound infections (8% vs 0%; P < .05) and parasthesia (27% vs 13%; P < .05) were more abundant in the surgery group, whereas the EVLA-treated patients reported more delayed tightness (17% vs 31%; P < .05). Surgically-treated patients suffered less postoperative pain (P < .05) but reported a higher use of analgesics (P < .05). Hospital stay in the surgery group was longer (P < .05) and they reported a longer delay before resuming work (7 vs 2 days; P < .0001). Patient satisfaction was equally high in both groups. At 25 weeks of follow-up, re-recurrences occurred in 29% of the surgically-treated patients and in 19% of the EVLA-treated patients (P = .511).\nEVLA is feasible in patients with recurrent varicose veins of the GSV. Complication rates are lower and socioeconomic outcome is better compared to surgical reintervention.",

    "abstract": "Color duplex ultrasound (CDU) imaging is a noninvasive alternative to computed tomography (CT) for the detection of endoleak. This study compared CT and CDU imaging in the detection of endoleaks requiring intervention after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nAll EVARs performed at our institution from 1996 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. CDU and CT scans < or =3 months were paired and the presence of an endoleak and its type were recorded. Clinical follow-up was reviewed and interventions for endoleak were recorded. Interventions were performed for type I, for type II with sac enlargement, and for type III endoleaks. The first analysis of clinical test outcomes used the findings of CT scan as a gold standard and the second used the findings at time of intervention as a gold standard.\nDuring the time period reviewed, 496 patients underwent EVAR, and 236 of these had CDU and CT follow-up studies paired < or =3 months of each other. Mean follow-up was 17 months (range, <1-111 months). We reviewed 944 studies or 472 pairs. Eighteen patients (7.6%) required intervention for 19 endoleaks: six type I, 11 type II, and two type III. Early endoleak (< or =1 month) requiring reintervention was detected in 1 vs late endoleak (mean, 28 months; range, 0.6-88 months) in 18. All type I and III endoleaks were treated with endovascular cuff or limb extension placement. Three type II endoleaks were treated with open ligation, and coil or glue embolization was used in eight. CDU imaging detected endoleaks requiring intervention in 89% of cases, whereas CT detected endoleak in 58% (P < .05). The ability to correctly identify the type of endoleak as confirmed at time of intervention was 74% with CDU imaging vs 42% by CT (P < .05). CDU, for the detection of endoleak requiring intervention, had a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 81%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 16%, while CT had a sensitivity of 58%, specificity of 87%, NPV of 98%, and PPV of 15%.\nCDU imaging has a high sensitivity in detecting endoleaks requiring intervention, is better at identifying the type of endoleak, and is an excellent test for graft surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair. Compared with CT scan, CDU imaging in our experience is the preferred test on which to base an intervention for endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) was previously employed to treat patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA). The use of HALS for juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (JAAA) has never been validated. In this study, we report our experience with this technique to demonstrate its feasibility and prove its safety in dealing with JAAA.\nFrom October 2000 to October 2008, we have selectively treated 271 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm with the HALS technique. Of these, 83 were JAAAs which required a suprarenal aortic clamping (group A), and 188 were IAAA (group B). General data of the two groups were analyzed for comparability purposes and operative and postoperative data were prospectively collected. Additionally, patients in group A were stratified in three classes according to their pre-existing degree of renal function impairment. Statistical significance was defined at the P < .05 level.\nMean operative time was 220 minutes +/- 66 in group A and 231 minutes +/- 64 in group B (P > .05). The mean duration of suprarenal clamping was 28 minutes +/- 6; whereas infrarenal clamping lasted an average of 25 minutes +/- 5 (P > .05). Mean intraoperative blood loss was 1023 +/- 584 mL for group A and 961 +/- 633 mL for group B (P > .05). No conversion or 30-day postoperative mortality was recorded in either group. Sixteen percent of the patients in group A developed a postoperative complication, vs 11% in group B (P > .05). Mean postoperative stay for group A and B was 4.2 +/- 1.5 and 4.2 +/- 1.9 days, respectively (P > .05). Postoperative kidney function significantly worsened in 5 patients in group A (6%). A prolonged warm ischemia time (>40), pre-existing renal dysfunction, and diabetes, correlated to the development of postoperative renal insufficiency. Follow-up of patients averaged 37.9 +/- 20 months. The incidence of incisional hernias in group A and B was 15.5% vs 11.1%, respectively (P > .05).\nThe HALS technique proved to be feasible and safe not only for patients with IAAA, but also for the management of patients with JAAA. No significant difference could be shown in the comparison between the two groups, apart from the expected higher rate of postoperative renal dysfunction after suprarenal clamping. In view of the demonstrated benefit of this minimally invasive approach, we believe that it should be included among the alternative options of treatment for these patients.",

    "abstract": "Venous lysis is usually reserved for symptomatic patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and low risk for bleeding. This study reports the use of pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis.\nA retrospective review of all patients with symptomatic DVT treated between 2007 and 2008 with PMT was performed. All patients were treated by a combination of local tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with the Angiojet (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, Minn) or Trellis device (Bacchus Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif). Catheter-directed lysis was used sparingly.\nForty-three patients (mean age, 48.4 +/- 16.6 years) presented with symptoms averaging 13.6 +/- 9.6 days in duration. Nineteen (44%) had symptoms for >14 days, and 15 (35%) had a high risk for bleeding. Symptomatic subclavian thrombosis occurred in eight (19%), and 35 (81%) presented with disabling lower extremity DVT (4 phlegmasia) despite anticoagulation.

    "abstract": "Although percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has become a common therapeutic standard for peripheral artery disease (PAD), high restenosis rates in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) remain a major problem. Nitinol stent implantation is reported to reduce restenosis in SFA after PTA in the general population; however, little is known about whether the nitinol stent improves primary patency after PTA in hemodialysis patients who are at higher risk of revascularization failure. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of nitinol stent implantation for primary patency in SFA after PTA in hemodialysis patients with PAD.\nEighty consecutive hemodialysis patients (167 SFA lesions) who underwent PTA with nitinol stents from January 2006 to January 2008 were compared with 64 hemodialysis patients (128 SFA lesions) who received stainless steel stents in the preceding 2 years. In the follow-up study to 2 years, incidence of restenosis, amputation, and all-cause mortality were analyzed. End points between the groups were examined with the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. Prognostic values for end points were calculated by a Cox univariate analysis and Cox multivariable regression models. To statistically minimize the differences in each stent group, a propensity-matched analysis was also performed using the model including male gender, age, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, incidence of ulcer/gangrene, and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) type C+D.\nThe 2-year primary patency rate was 58% in the nitinol group vs 42% in the stainless steel group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.84; P = .0045), despite a higher prevalence of TASC C+D lesion in the nitinol group (68% vs 49%, P = .0014). In 108 lesions matched after propensity score analysis, the primary patency for 2 years was 64% in the nitinol group vs 42% in the stainless steel group (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.24-0.65; P = .0003). Cox multivariate models showed nitinol stent (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25-0.73; P = .002), age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; P = .031), and incidence of ulcer/gangrene (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.17-4.75; P = .017) were independent predictors of restenosis.\nThese data suggest that nitinol stent implantation improves primary patency in SFA after PTA compared with the stainless steel stent, even in hemodialysis patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "Image-guided surgery provides a mechanism to accurately and quickly assess the location of surgical tools relative to a preoperative image. Traditional image-guided surgery relies on infrared or radiofrequency triangulation to determine an instrument location relative to a preoperative image and has been primarily used in head and neck procedures. Advances in ultrasonic tracking devices, designed for tracking catheters within vessels, may provide an opportunity for image-guided endovascular procedures. This study evaluates the positional accuracy of an ultrasonic navigation system for tracking an endovascular catheter when different stents and graft materials have been deployed in an in vitro system.\nStent and graft materials commonly used in endovascular procedures were used for this study in combination with a custom three-head ultrasonic transducer navigation system. The stents evaluated were composed of Dacron/nitinol, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/nitinol, and bare nitinol. They were deployed into excised porcine tissue cannulized with a rotary drill, and a catheter with a custom microtransducer probe was inserted. The distance from each ultrasonic tracking module to a probe mounted on an endovascular catheter was measured using time of flight techniques, and the catheter position in three-dimensions was calculated using triangulation.\nThe measured position was compared to the actual catheter position determined by a precision translation stage. The PTFE/nitinol, bare nitinol, and Dacron/nitinol stent materials were evaluated and resulted in a maximum error of 1.7, 3.0, and 3.6 mm and an SD of 0.7, 1.2, and 1.4 mm, respectively. A reduction in signal intensity of up to 6x was observed during passage of the endovascular probe through the stent materials, but no reduction in the accuracy of the ultrasonic navigation system was evident.\nThe use of an ultrasonic-based navigation system is feasible in endovascular procedures, even in the presence of common stent materials. It may have promise as a navigational tool for endovascular procedures.",

This likely happened as a result of penetration of the wire and filter sheath through the iliac vein or vena cava into the retroperitoneum, vertebral foramina, and spinal canal at the level of L2 and L3. Due to the patient's condition, the filter was not removed and no neurologic symptoms have occurred. This represents the first reported case of a filter deployment into the spinal canal. Although placement of vena cava filters is a relatively safe procedure, complications are seen commonly due to the large number of procedures performed. Spinal complications, however, are rarely reported. This is the first reported case of the inadvertent placement of a vena cava filter into the spinal canal.",

    "abstract": "An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis, offering lower morbidity, mortality, and cost compared with grafts or catheters. Patients with a difficult access extremity have often lost all superficial veins, and even basilic veins may be obliterated. We have used brachial vein transposition AVFs (BVT-AVFs) in these challenging patients and review our experience in this report.\nThe study reviewed consecutive patients in whom BVT-AVFs were created from September 2006 to March 2009. Most BVT-AVFs were created in staged procedures, with the second-stage transposition operations completed 4 to 6 weeks after the first-stage AVF operation. A single-stage BVT-AVF was created when the brachial vein diameter was > or =6 mm.\nWe identified 58 BVT-AVF procedures, comprising 41 women (71.0%), 28 diabetic patients (48.3%), and 29 (50.0%) had previous access surgery. The operation was completed in two stages in 45 operations (77.6%) and was a primary transposition in 13 patients. However, five of these were secondary AVFs with previous distal AV grafts or AVFs placed elsewhere; effectively, late staged procedures. Follow-up was a mean of 11 months (range, 2.0-31.7 months). Primary patency, primary-assisted patency, and cumulative (secondary) patency were 52.0%, 84.9%, and 92.4% at 12 months and 46.2%, 75.5%, and 92.4% at 24 months, respectively. Harvesting the brachial vein was tedious and more difficult than harvesting other superficial veins. No prosthetic grafts were used.\nBVT-AVFs provide a suitable option for autogenous access when the basilic vein is absent in patients with difficult access extremities. Most patients required intervention for access maturation or maintenance. Most BVT-AVFs were created with staged procedures. Cumulative (secondary) patency was 92.4% at 24 months.",

The provider's specialty was identified by a specialty-specific algorithm and analyzed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Market share trends and distribution of cases at teaching versus non-teaching hospitals were evaluated. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and iatrogenic arterial injuries (IAI). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of post-procedure morbidity and mortality.\nThe number of cases identified was 23,825. From 1998 to 2005, IR's market share decreased six-fold (1998: 33% to 2005: 5.6%) whereas VS market share increased from 27% to 43% and IC from 10% to 29% (P < .05). A similar but more pronounced trend was observed at teaching hospitals. In-hospital mortality rate was highest for IR (2.1 IR% vs 1.2% VS and 0.6% IC; P < .001). Post-procedure IAI was highest in the IC group (1.3% vs IR 0.9% and 0.5% VS; P < .05). Compared with VS, the mortality rate was 1.62 times higher for IR patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-2.24) and IAI was 2.44 times higher for IC (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.63-3.66) and 1.75 times higher for IR (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.08-2.81) patients.\nIR market share of PAI has precipitously declined while those of VS and IC have increased significantly. Vascular surgeons had the lowest overall morbidity and mortality of all groups. Increase in the number of endovascularly-trained VS with better access to fluoroscopy units may further increase VS's market share.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies showed that the direct injection of an adenovirus construct expressing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) into experimental venous thrombi significantly reduces thrombus weight. The systemic use of adenovirus vectors is limited by inherent hepatic tropism and inflammatory response. As macrophages are recruited into venous thrombi, it is reasonable to speculate that these cells could be used to target the adenovirus uPA (ad-uPA) gene construct to the thrombus. The aims of this study were to determine whether macrophages transduced with ad-uPA have increased fibrinolytic activity and whether systemic injection of transduced cells could be used to target uPA expression to the thrombus and reduce its size.\nThe effect of up-regulating uPA was examined in an immortalized macrophage cell line (MM6) and macrophages differentiated from human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HBMMs). Cells were infected with ad-uPA or blank control virus (ad-blank). Fibrinolytic mediator expression, cell viability, and cytokine expression were measured by activity assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Monocyte migration was measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay. A model of venous thrombosis was developed and characterized in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This model was used to study whether systemically administered macrophages over-expressing uPA reduced thrombus size. Uptake of HBMMs into the thrombus induced in these mice was confirmed by a combination of PKH2-labeled cell tracking and colocalization with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) by immunohistology.\nCompared with ad-blank, treated HBMMs transduction with ad-uPA increased uPA production by >1000-fold (P = .003), uPA activity by 150-fold (P = .0001), and soluble uPA receptor (uPAR) by almost twofold (P = .043). Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and PAI-2 was decreased by about twofold (P = .011) and threefold (P = .005), respectively. Up-regulation of uPA had no effect on cell viability or inflammatory cytokine production compared with ad-blank or untreated cells. Ad-uPA transduction increased the migration rate of HBMMs (about 20%, P = .03) and MM6 cells (>twofold, P = .005) compared with ad-blank treated controls. Human macrophage recruitment into the mouse thrombus was confirmed by the colocalization of HLA with the PKH2-marked cells. Systemic injection of uPA-up-regulated HBMMs reduced thrombus weight by approximately 20% compared with ad-blank (P = .038) or sham-treated controls (P = .0028).\nTransduction of HBBM with ad-uPA increases their fibrinolytic activity. Systemic administration of uPA up-regulated HBBMs reduced thrombus size in an experimental model of venous thrombosis. Alternative methods of delivering fibrinolytic agents are worth exploring.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been advocated as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in high-risk surgical patients, including stenosis after CEA. This study compared early and midterm clinical outcomes for primary CAS vs CAS for post-CEA stenosis.\nThis study analyzed 180 high-risk surgical patients: 68 had primary CAS (group A), and 112 had CAS for post-CEA stenosis (group B). Patients were followed-up prospectively and had duplex ultrasound imaging at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. All patients had cerebral protection devices. Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis was used to estimate rates of freedom from stroke, stroke-free survival, > or =50% in-stent stenosis, > or =80% in-stent stenosis, and target vessel reintervention (TVR).\nPatients had comparable demographic and clinical characteristics. Carotid stent locations were similar. Indications for CAS were transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or stroke in 50% for group A and 45% for group B. The mean follow-up was comparable, at 21 (range, 1-73) vs 25 (range, 1-78) months, respectively. The technical success rate was 100%. The perioperative stroke rates and combined stroke/death/myocardial infarction (MI) rates were 7.4% for group A vs 0.9% for group B (P = .0294). No perioperative MIs occurred in either group. One death was secondary to stroke. The combined early and late stroke rates were 10.8% for group A and 1.8% for group B (P = .0275). The stroke-free rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for groups A and B were 89%, 89%, 89%, and 89%; and 98%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively (P = .0105).

    "abstract": "The theory of primary venous dilatation leading to secondary valvular incompetence and varicose vein formation has received more attention nowadays. Although many studies have investigated the role of the main components of the venous wall in the development of varicose veins, the leading cause remains unknown. The present study was designed to establish the role of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the tunica media on the pathogenesis of varicose veins by analyzing the phenotypic and functional differences between SMCs derived from varicose veins and normal veins.\nSMCs were isolated and cultured from saphenous veins of patients with varicose veins and normal veins. Cell proliferation and migration rates were compared. Expression of phenotype-dependent markers and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP) production were analyzed by immunoblotting. Total collagen synthesis was evaluated by measuring the radioactivity of L-[3, 4-(3)H]proline in the media and the cell layer.\nSMCs derived from varicose veins demonstrated increased proliferation (2-fold, P < .01), migration (3-fold, P < .001), MMP-2 production (3-fold, P < .01), and collagen synthesis (>2-fold, P < .001), with decreased expression of phenotype-dependent markers compared with SMCs derived from normal veins (P < .05).\nSMCs derived from varicose veins are more dedifferentiated and demonstrate increased proliferative and synthetic capacity than SMCs derived from normal veins. These properties may contribute to the remodeling of the venous wall and the weakening of its antipressure capacity.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the latex agglutination D-dimer assay is widely used for excluding deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but is considered less sensitive than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based D-dimer test. The purpose of the present study was to determine if a combination of different cutoff points, rather than a single cutoff point of 1.0 microg/mL, on the latex agglutination D-dimer assay and the pretest clinical probability (PTP) score would be able to reduce the use of venous duplex ultrasound (DU) scanning in patients with suspected DVT.\nThe PTP score and D-dimer testing were used to evaluate 989 consecutive patients with suspected DVT before venous DU scanning. After calculating the clinical probability scores, patients were divided into low-risk (< or =0 points), moderate-risk (1-2 points), and high-risk (> or =3 points) pretest clinical probability groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the appropriate D-dimer cutoff point for each PTP with a negative predictive value of >98% for a positive DU scan.\nThere were 886 patients enrolled. The study group included 609 inpatients (68.7%) and 277 outpatients (31.3%). The prevalence of DVT in this series was 28.9%. There were 508 patients (57.3%) classified as low-risk, 237 (26.8%) as moderate-risk, and 141 (14.9%) as high-risk PTP. DVT was identified in 29 patients (5.7%) with low-risk, 118 (49.8%) with moderate-risk, and 109 (77.3%) with high-risk PTP scores. ROC curve analysis was used to select D-dimer cutoff points of 2.6, 1.1, and 1.1 microg/mL for the low-, moderate- and high-risk PTP groups, respectively. In the low-risk PTP group, specificity increased from 48.9% to 78.2% (P < .0001) with use of the different D-dimer cutoff value. In the moderate- and high-risk PTP groups, however, the different D-dimer levels did not achieve substantial improvement. Despite this, the overall use of venous DU scanning could have been reduced by 43.0% (381 of 886) if the different D-dimer cutoff points had been used.\nCombination of a specific D-dimer level with the clinical probability score is most effective in low-risk PTP patients for excluding DVT. In moderate- and high-risk PTP patients, however, the recommended cutoff points of 1.0 microg/mL may be preferable. These results show that different D-dimer levels for patients differing in risk is feasible for excluding DVT using the latex agglutination D-dimer assay.",

DVT was identified in 29 patients (5.7%) with low-risk, 118 (49.8%) with moderate-risk, and 109 (77.3%) with high-risk PTP scores. ROC curve analysis was used to select D-dimer cutoff points of 2.6, 1.1, and 1.1 microg/mL for the low-, moderate- and high-risk PTP groups, respectively. In the low-risk PTP group, specificity increased from 48.9% to 78.2% (P < .0001) with use of the different D-dimer cutoff value. In the moderate- and high-risk PTP groups, however, the different D-dimer levels did not achieve substantial improvement. Despite this, the overall use of venous DU scanning could have been reduced by 43.0% (381 of 886) if the different D-dimer cutoff points had been used.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of percutaneous transhepatic balloon angioplasty (PTBA) of the hepatic vein in the management of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) secondary to hepatic venous outflow obstruction.\nFrom September 1996 to October 2008, 101 patients (52 males, 49 females) with BCS secondary to occlusion of the hepatic veins were prospectively treated using PTBA of the hepatic vein. Average age was 31.3 years (range, 15-57 years). Nineteen had concurrent inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction. All the patients presented with symptomatic portal hypertension. PTBA, with or without stenting, was performed after hepatovenography.\nPTBA was successfully performed in 92 of the 101 patients. Sixty-eight patients underwent PTBA of right hepatic vein, followed by stent placement in two. PTBA was performed in 11 patients with left hepatic vein occlusion and in 13 patients with dominant accessory hepatic vein occlusion. The technical success rate was 92 of 101 (91%). Hepatic venous pressure was significantly decreased after balloon angioplasty/stenting (P < .01, paired t test). Symptoms were significantly improved in the 92 patients who had successful PTBA. Three patients had acute hepatic vein thrombosis during or after PTBA. Two patients sustained intraperitoneal bleeding from the transhepatic puncture track, and one had intrahepatic hematoma. Pulmonary embolism developed in one patient during the operation. All complications were managed nonoperatively. There were no perioperative deaths. Within 1 year, 74 of the 101 patients returned for follow-up, and 51 patients had follow-up at 2 years. The primary patency rates were 84% (62 of 74), 78% (58 of 74), and 76% (39 or 51) at 6, 12, and 24 months after PTBA, respectively. The secondary patency rates were 95% (70 of 74), 92% (68 of 74), and 84% (43 of 51) at 6, 12, and 24 months.\nPTBA of the hepatic vein is a safe and effective treatment of BCS. It is currently the most physiologic procedure, and the risk of postoperative encephalopathy is minimized because portal flow is not diverted. Midterm outcomes are satisfactory. Further investigation of the long-term outcomes is needed.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with the Endologix Powerlink System (Endologix, Inc, Irvine, Calif) has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to open surgery in patients having an aortic neck diameter of up to 26 mm. We assessed the safety and effectiveness of AAA repair in patients with wide aortic necks (up to 32 mm in diameter) using the Powerlink XL System.\nBetween September 2005 and June 2008, a prospective, multicenter, pivotal US Food and Drug Administration trial of the Powerlink XL System for endovascular aneurysm repair was conducted at 13 centers. Using a sizing algorithm based on computed tomography scan (CT)-based measurements, a total of 78 patients (N = 60 [pivotal trial]; N = 18 [continued access]) presenting with AAA and an infrarenal aortic neck up to 32 mm in diameter received a bifurcated stent graft via anatomical fixation at the aortoiliac bifurcation and proximal sealing with a Powerlink XL infrarenal proximal extension stent graft. Postoperatively, results were assessed with contrast-enhanced CT scans and abdominal x-rays at one, six, and 12 months, with continued annual follow-up to five years.\nPredominantly male (91%), patients presented at a mean age of 73 +/- 8.6 years with mean maximum aortic neck and AAA diameters of 31 +/- 1.9 mm (range, 25 to 32 mm) and 5.7 +/- 1.0 cm (range, 4.3 to 10 cm), respectively. Challenging infrarenal aortic neck anatomy, defined as the presence of severe thrombus and/or reverse taper, was present in 85% of patients. Technical success was achieved in 98.7% of patients, with one patient requiring femoral-femoral bypass intraoperatively. Aneurysm exclusion was achieved in 100% of patients over a mean procedure time of 129 +/- 66 minutes. Patients were discharged at a mean of 2.2 days postoperatively. At the one-month CT scan, the independent core lab identified a Type II endoleak in 13 patients, distal Type I and Type II endoleak in one patient, and unknown endoleak in three patients. At 30 days, there were no deaths, conversions, ruptures, or migrations. Through one year follow-up, Type II endoleak predominated (9/10 patients with endoleak), with one proximal Type I and no Type III, IV, or unknown endoleak; no conversions, ruptures, or migrations have been observed. The one-year all-cause mortality rate was 6.4%, with 100% freedom from aneurysm-related mortality. Secondary procedures were performed within one year in five patients (6.4%) for treatment of proximal Type I endoleak (n = 2), proximal Type I/Type II endoleak (n = 1), and distal Type I endoleak (n = 2). Reduced or stable aneurysm sac diameter at one year is observed in 96% of patients.\nThe combination of an anatomically-fixed Powerlink bifurcated stent graft and a Powerlink XL infrarenal proximal extension appears safe and effectively excludes aneurysms in patients with wide aortic necks. These results suggest that fixation at the aortic bifurcation can provide secure fixation for patients with large diameter diseased proximal aortic necks.",

    "abstract": "As in arteries, venous endothelium modulates vessel homeostasis and tone. The effect of an arterialized environment on venous endothelial function remains poorly understood. In particular, regulation of saphenous vein graft (SVG) blood flow and lumen caliber remains undefined. We hypothesized that mature SVGs would exhibit endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). We further hypothesized that endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) was an important mediator.\nPatients with femoral to popliteal artery SVGs that had maintained primary patency and were at least 1 year from surgery were enrolled. High-resolution, B-mode ultrasound scans were used to measure vein graft diameter before and 1 minute after reactive hyperemia (RH) to determine FMD. RH was created through application of 220 mm Hg to the calf for 5 minutes with a sphygmomanometric cuff. After a 10-minute recovery period, nitroglycerin-mediated, endothelium-independent vasodilation was measured 3 minutes after administration of nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually. Brachial artery FMD was determined by validated techniques. L-N(G)monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA; 1 mg/kg infusion over 10 minutes) was used in a subset of patients (n = 6) to competitively inhibit endothelial NO synthase.\nNineteen subjects were enrolled. The median age of the SVGs was 34.6 (21.0-49.7) months. SVG flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was measured at 5.28% +/- 3.1% mean change in lumen diameter (range, 1.99%-9.36%; P < .0001 for diameter change). Nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilation was 3.7% +/- 1.0%, (range, 16%-10.04%; P < .005). Intravenous administration of L-NMMA abolished SVG FMD (5.7 +/- 1.4% before L-NMMA vs 0.01 +/- 0.01% during L-NMMA infusion; P = .0088) and attenuated brachial artery FMD (7.54% +/- 1.0% vs 5.7 +/- 1.4; P = .05).\nSVGs manifest flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent, and nitroglycerin-mediated endothelium-independent vasodilation. Vein graft endothelium-dependent FMD is likely mediated by NO. Further investigation will be required to determine the role of endothelial function in vein graft patency.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and outcome of endovascular therapy combined with immunosuppressive therapy for aortic pseudoaneurysms in patients with Beh\u00e7et disease.\nBetween April 2002 and April 2008, 12 pseudoaneurysms (9 involving the intrarenal abdominal aorta, 1 at the suprarenal level, and 2 in the supraceliac aorta) in nine men and one woman with Beh\u00e7et disease were evaluated at Peking Union Medical Center (PUMC). Three bifurcated stent grafts and seven tubular stent grafts, including two fenestrated stent grafts, were deployed. All 10 patients received immunosuppressive therapy after the implant procedure.\nAll patients underwent successful endovascular therapy without major complications during the 30 days immediately after the procedure. One patient with two aneurysms had treatment of only the larger infrarenal symptomatic aneurysm, but the smaller suprarenal pseudoaneurysm was not addressed because of its proximity to mesenteric branches. During a mean follow-up of 25.8 months (range, 6-50 months), nine aneurysms resolved completely in eight patients. The only untreated aneurysm, which coexisted with a treated lesion, remained stable under imaging observation. Three aneurysms recurred in two patients. At 6 months, one patient presented with a new aneurysm at the femoral artery access site for stent graft introduction and another formed at the proximal margin of the stent graft. Despite medical advice, he had stopped immunotherapy. He died from aneurysm rupture 8 months after stent deployment. Another patient with recurrent aneurysmal disease at the distal margin of the primary stent was successfully treated with an additional stent graft.

One patient with two aneurysms had treatment of only the larger infrarenal symptomatic aneurysm, but the smaller suprarenal pseudoaneurysm was not addressed because of its proximity to mesenteric branches. During a mean follow-up of 25.8 months (range, 6-50 months), nine aneurysms resolved completely in eight patients. The only untreated aneurysm, which coexisted with a treated lesion, remained stable under imaging observation. Three aneurysms recurred in two patients. At 6 months, one patient presented with a new aneurysm at the femoral artery access site for stent graft introduction and another formed at the proximal margin of the stent graft. Despite medical advice, he had stopped immunotherapy. He died from aneurysm rupture 8 months after stent deployment. Another patient with recurrent aneurysmal disease at the distal margin of the primary stent was successfully treated with an additional stent graft.

    "abstract": "Early in our experience with endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) we performed both serial computed tomography scans and duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging in our post-EVAR surveillance regimen. Later we conducted a prospective study with DU imaging as the sole surveillance study and determined cost savings and outcome using this strategy.\nFrom September 21, 1998, to May 30, 2008, 250 patients underwent EVAR at our hospital. Before July 1, 2004, EVAR patients underwent CT and DU imaging performed every 6 months during the first year and then annually if no problems were identified (group 1). We compared aneurysm sac size, presence of endoleak, and graft patency between the two scanning modalities. After July 1, 2004, patients underwent surveillance using DU imaging as the sole surveillance study unless a problem was detected (group 2). CT and DU imaging charges for each regimen were compared using our 2008 health system pricing and Medicare reimbursements. All DU examinations were performed in our accredited noninvasive vascular laboratory by experienced technologists. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation coefficient.\nDU and CT scans were equivalent in determining aneurysm sac diameter after EVAR (P < .001). DU and CT were each as likely to falsely suggest an endoleak when none existed and were as likely to miss an endoleak. Using DU imaging alone would have reduced cost of EVAR surveillance by 29% ($534,356) in group 1. Cost savings of $1595 per patient per year were realized in group 2 by eliminating CT scan surveillance. None of the group 2 patients sustained an adverse event such as rupture, graft migration, or limb occlusion as a result of having DU imaging performed as the sole follow-up modality.\nSurveillance of EVAR patients can be performed accurately, safely, and cost-effectively with DU as the sole imaging study.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair of aortobronchial fistulas is an emerging treatment modality for this highly lethal condition. The feasibility and long-term durability of this form of intervention are largely unknown.\nThe records of five patients who received endografts to treat aortobronchial fistulas at our institution were reviewed. A literature review was also conducted using MEDLINE to identify reports detailing outcomes of patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair for this condition. Primary outcome end points included intraoperative mortality, 30-day mortality, and aortobronchial fistula recurrence.\nFor the five patients treated at our institution, technical success was 100%. In follow-up, aortobronchial fistulas recurred in two patients, resulting in one patient death and one endograft explantation. We identified 32 reports that met inclusion for our final review. Inclusive of the five patients treated at out institution, 67 patients with reported outcomes comprised the overall analysis. Most patients (55%) had previously undergone thoracic aortic surgery. Commercially manufactured thoracic endografts were used in 75% of patients. No intraoperative mortality was reported, and the 30-day mortality was 1.5%. Aortobronchial fistula recurred after endovascular repair in six patients (9%) through a mean follow-up of 21.5 months. Three cases of recurrent aortobronchial fistula resulted in patient death.\nThoracic endovascular aortic repair of aortobronchial fistulas appears to a viable alternative to conventional open repair with excellent short-term results. Recurrence of the aortobronchial fistula after endovascular repair is a potential complication necessitating long-term surveillance. Individual risk assessment is needed to determine if endovascular repair should be used as bridge therapy or as a definitive repair.",

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome patients are prone to aortic dilatation, dissection, and rupture. Success of aortic root replacement has generated a cohort of patients surviving longer and presenting with distal aortic dissection and enlargement. Thoracic endovascular stent-graft repair (TEVR) is being increasingly utilized to exclude aneurysms resulting from chronic aortic dissection. This report explores the role of TEVR in Marfan patients with this pathology.\nReview of a prospectively maintained database identified seven patients with Marfan syndrome offered endovascular repair of aneurysmal chronic aortic dissection. All patients had previous aortic root repair. Talent or Valiant (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) aortic stent-grafts were used to occlude the dissection entry tear and cover the thoracic aorta. Electronic data, case notes, and radiological surveillance were analyzed.\nSeven consecutive patients (six male; mean age, 45.9 +/- 10 years, range, 29 to 63) underwent successful thoracic stent-graft deployment. Mean aortic aneurysmal diameter was 63.4mm (+/-11.2) with six of seven dissections extending to the aortic bifurcation. No perioperative neurological events occurred. Thirty-day mortality was 1/7 (14%) due to congestive cardiac failure. At median 16 month follow-up, two of six cases (33%) required intervention for endoleak. Aortic false lumen thrombosis (FLT) occurred in 5/6 (83%) cases and partial FLT occurred in 1/6 (17%). All thoracic aortas continued to dilate during follow-up. Crude median aortic growth rate was 7.2 mm/year (range, 3.5 to 19 mm).\nTEVR in Marfan syndrome patients with chronic aortic dissection is technically feasible. However, post intervention surveillance confirms that the aorta continues to dilate despite graft deployment and false lumen thrombosis. Endovascular repair may offer a viable option in patients who have contraindications to open surgery, but longer follow up of more patients is required to define the place of this therapy.",

    "abstract": "Venodynamics and lymphodynamics may interact as an inseparable and mutually dependent dual outflow system. This study investigated the effect of surgical treatment on lower limb lymph flow in patients with varicose veins.\nThirty-nine patients with varicose veins in the lower limb (28 patients with unilateral limb, 11 patients with bilateral limb), who demonstrated great saphenous vein reflux, were investigated with air-plethysmography and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence lymphography before surgical treatment and 6 months later. Fifteen healthy volunteers participated in this study as a control. With air-plethysmography, venous volume (VV) and venous filling time were measured. Venous filling index (VFI) was calculated. For ICG lymphography, 0.3 mL of ICG (0.5%) was subcutaneously injected at the dorsum of the foot. After the injection, fluorescent image of ICG dye was traced on real-time video images using a near-infrared camera system. The interval until the dye reached the knee was measured (transit time [TT]) in a standing position, which was previously demonstrated to correlate with the interval measured using dynamic isotope lymphoscintigraphy.\nIn CEAP clinical stage venous disease, TT in patients with C4 approximately 6 and C2 approximately 3 was significantly longer than that in the control group (587 +/- 97 seconds, 484 +/- 82 seconds, 252 +/- 29 seconds, respectively, mean +/- SD, P < .01). Among all limbs with varicose veins, there were correlations between TT and VV (Pearson r = 0.31, P < .01), between TT and VFI (Pearson r = 0.48, P < .01). All patients underwent great saphenous vein stripping. Six months later, the venous clinical severity score significantly improved with significant reductions in both VV and VFI values. TT 6 months postoperatively was also significantly shorter than that before surgical treatment (501 +/- 67 seconds, 340 +/- 38 seconds, respectively, mean +/- SD, P < .01).\nVaricose veins could affect lymphatic function and delay lymphatic flow in the lower limbs. Derangement of lymph flow may correlate with the severity of clinical venous disease and/or the magnitude of venous reflux, which could be reversible with surgical treatment of venous incompetence.",

This study's objective was to compare the clinical outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing carotid revascularization before and after CAS became widely available.\nThis observational, retrospective cohort study compared 46,784 patients undergoing carotid revascularization from August 2005-March 2006 (the coverage era) to propensity-score-matched patients undergoing carotid revascularization between October 2002-September 2004 (the pre-coverage era), before widespread Medicare coverage of CAS.\nMortality was compared at 90 and 270 days after revascularization, as were the combined outcomes of periprocedural acute myocardial infarction and any stroke or death within 90 and 270 days after revascularization, between the two eras. Comparisons were also made between localities with high (23% of carotid procedures being CAS) and lower (9% of carotid procedures being CAS) adoption rates of carotid stents during the coverage era.\nThere were no significant differences in 90-day mortality (2.2% vs 2.2%; P = .79), 90-day combined outcomes (4.5% vs 4.3%; P = .13), or 270-day mortality (4.8% vs 4.6%; P = .17) between the coverage and pre-coverage eras, but there were more 270-day combined outcomes in the coverage era (7.7% vs 7.3%; P = .03). In localities with higher adoption of carotid stents, there was higher 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.15; P = .16), 90-day combined outcomes (OR = 1.17; P = .03), 270-day mortality (OR = 1.13; P = .07), and 270-day combined outcomes (OR = 1.10; P = .09) in the coverage era. There were no differences in event rates between eras in areas with lower carotid stent adoption.\nThe adoption of carotid stents for treatment of carotid stenosis was associated with increased rates of adverse clinical outcomes after carotid revascularization.",

Of the 5514 participants with a baseline ABI between 0.90 and 1.40, 89 (1.6%) had an ABI < or = 0.90 (\"low ABI group\") and 71 (1.3%) had an ABI > or = 1.40 (\"high ABI group\") 3 years later. On multivariable analysis, the odds for having progressed into the low ABI group were significantly increased for higher baseline age, hypertension, diabetes, greater pack-years of cigarette smoking, and homocysteine levels. The odds for progression into the high ABI group were increased for male gender and higher body mass index. Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans had a significantly higher odds for progression to the low ABI group (odds ratio [OR]: 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-3.88) while having a reduced odds for progression to the high ABI group (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-1.00). Neither Chinese nor Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with progression to either ABI group.\nThe risk factors for progression to a low or high ABI were distinct and African Americans were at increased risk for progression to a low ABI but at decreased risk for progression into the high ABI group.",

According to multislice computed tomography scan findings, the aneurysm was classified as Crawford type III. Coronary angiography revealed a giant aneurysm of the left coronary artery and aneurysm of the circumflex artery. Functional tests for myocardial perfusion and function revealed no significant ischemic territories. Because of symptoms of imminent rupture, aneurysm resection and aortic reconstruction with a 26-mm zero porosity Dacron graft was performed and was successful. Cardiovascular consequences of Kawasaki disease are discussed with attention to the late sequelae. Indications for surgical treatment and importance of follow-up into adulthood are emphasized.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (aRVD) is an increasingly recognized cause of severe hypertension and declining kidney function. Patients with aRVD have been demonstrated to have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events compared with patients without aRVD. For these reasons, >45,000 renal artery revascularization procedures are performed annually, with significant growth observed in the number of procedures performed each year. The efficacy of contemporary revascularization therapies in the treatment of aRVD is unproven and controversial, with no level I data to support current practices. Lower-level data suggest that kidney function improvement is a key indicator of subsequent improved survival free of adverse cardiovascular events and dialysis, and that observed improvements of hypertension confer, at best, limited benefit. This review focuses on existing data on the management of aRVD, including data from completed and ongoing randomized clinical trials. This review also examines other existing data regarding aRVD that may guide current treatment and future research efforts into this significant clinical and public health problem until widely accepted level I evidence emerges.",

    "abstract": "Aortobronchial fistula (ABF) and aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) are rare but lethal if untreated; open thoracic surgery is associated with high operative mortality and morbidity. In this case series, we sought to investigate outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for emergency cases of ABF and AEF.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients with AEF and ABF undergoing TEVAR in three European teaching hospitals between 2000 and January 2009. Eleven patients were identified including 6 patients with ABF, 4 patients with AEF, and 1 patient with a combined ABF and AEF. In-hospital outcomes and follow-up after TEVAR were evaluated.\nMedian age was 63 years (interquartile range, 31); 8 were male. Ten patients presented with hemoptysis or hematemesis; 4 developed hemorrhagic shock. All patients underwent immediate TEVAR, and 3 AEF patients required additional esophageal surgery. Five patients died (45%), including 3 patients with AEF, 1 patient with ABF, and 1 patient with a combined ABF and AEF, after a median duration of 22 days (interquartile range, 51 days). The patient with AEF that survived had received early esophageal reconstruction. Causes of death were: sepsis (n = 2), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 1), thoracic infections (n = 1), and aortic rupture (n = 1). Median follow-up of surviving patients was 45 months (interquartile range, 45 months). Six additional vascular interventions were performed in 3 survivors.\nTEVAR does prevent immediate exsanguination in patients admitted with AEF and ABF, but after initial deployment of the endograft and control of the hemodynamic status, most patients, in particular those with AEF, are at risk for infectious complications. Early esophageal repair after TEVAR appears to improve the survival in case of AEF. Therefore, TEVAR may serve as a bridge to surgery in emergency cases of AEF with subsequent definitive open operative repair of the esophageal defect as soon as possible. In patients with ABF, additional open surgery may not be necessary after the endovascular procedure.",

Tibial artery interventional therapy has been proven to lead to limb salvage with low morbidity and mortality in patients with critical limb ischemia and should be used as a first line treatment mode in the majority of patients, especially in those with significant medical comorbidities. The exceptions are the patients with extensive tissue loss and infection, where endovascular therapy may not restore enough flow to achieve rapid healing and limb salvage, and those patients with tissue loss in the setting extensive, multi-level, occlusive disease, where patency to the completion of wound healing will be unlikely. However, differences in outcome between available devices are unknown and ways to increase long term patency remain poorly defined.",

    "abstract": "Limitations of endovascular thoracic aneurysm treatment include small, tortuous, or severely calcified iliac arteries. We present our experience with a total laparoscopic access to deploy thoracic endografts.\nA total laparoscopic left retrocolic approach was used in all cases. A Dacron conduit was laparoscopically sutured to either the iliac artery or to the aorta directly. The endograft was inserted through this conduit. After graft deployment, the Dacron prosthesis was tunneled to the groin and anastomosed with the femoral artery.\nThe laparoscopic procedure could successfully be performed in 11 patients. In six cases, the aorta was used as an access and in five patients, the iliac arteries were preferred. In one of these cases, the right iliac artery was used for deployment of the endograft. After successful aorto- or ileo-femoral bypass grafting, all patients had an improvement of their ankle brachial index postoperatively. The mean operative time was almost four hours, including laparoscopy, laparoscopic anastomosis, endograft deployment, and femoral artery anastomosis or profundaplasty.\nTotally laparoscopic assisted graft implantation in aorta or iliac arteries provides a safe and effective access for the endovascular delivery system. However, further evaluation and long follow-up are necessary to ensure the potential advantages of this technique. It is a less invasive option to overcome access-related problems with thoracic endograft deployment, giving the patient the advantage of a totally minimal invasive procedure.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are important in the development of intimal hyperplasia, the major cause of vein graft failure. Proteases of the plasminogen activator (PA) system and of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system are pivotal in extracellular matrix degradation and, by that, SMC migration. Previously, we demonstrated that inhibition of both protease systems simultaneously with viral gene delivery of the hybrid protein TIMP-1.ATF, consisting of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and the receptor-binding amino terminal fragment (ATF) of urokinase, reduces SMC migration and neointima formation in an in vitro restenosis model using human saphenous vein cultures more efficiently than both protease systems separately. Because use of viral gene delivery is difficult in clinical application, this study used nonviral delivery of TIMP-1.ATF plasmid to reduce vein graft disease in a murine bypass model. Nonviral gene transfer by electroporation was used to avert major disadvantages of viral gene delivery, such as immune responses and short-term expression.\nPlasmids encoding ATF, TIMP-1, TIMP-1.ATF, or luciferase, as a control, were injected and electroporated in both calf muscles of hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E3-Leiden (APOE*3Leiden) mice (n = 8). One day after electroporation, a venous interposition of a donor mouse was placed into the carotid artery of a recipient mouse. In this model, vein graft thickening develops with features of accelerated atherosclerosis. Vein grafts were harvested 4 weeks after electroporation and surgery, and histologic analysis of the vessel wall was performed.\nElectroporation-mediated overexpression of the plasmid vectors resulted in a prolonged expression of the transgenes and resulted in a significant reduction of vein graft thickening (ATF: 36% +/- 9%, TIMP-1: 49% +/- 5%, TIMP-1.ATF: 58% +/- 5%; P < .025). Although all constructs reduced vein graft thickening compared with the controls, the luminal area was best preserved in the TIMP-1.ATF-treated mice.\nIntramuscular electroporation of TIMP-1.ATF inhibits vein graft thickening in vein grafts in carotid arteries of hypercholesterolemic mice. Binding of TIMP-1.ATF hybrid protein to the u-PA receptor at the cell surface enhances the inhibitory effect of TIMP-1 on vein graft remodeling in vitro as well as in vivo and may be an effective strategy to prevent vein graft disease.",

    "abstract": "Smoking not only increases the risk that coronary heart disease will develop but also morbidity and mortality in patients with known coronary atherosclerosis and after coronary artery bypass grafting. Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated as the final common pathway for the development of endothelial dysfunction in various cardiovascular risk factors. This study assessed the influence of smoking on two different human arteries routinely used as coronary artery bypass graft conduits.\nIsometric tension was recorded on discarded segments of human left internal thoracic artery (ITA) and the radial artery (RA) from smokers and nonsmokers.\nThe contractile response to endothelin-1 was significantly stronger in arteries from smokers than in those from nonsmokers. By contrast, endothelium-dependent relaxant responses to acetylcholine were attenuated in RA rings but enhanced in ITA rings from smokers. In additional experiments, 5-(&6)-chloromethyl-2'-7'-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCDHF) was used to photochemically detect ROS by confocal imaging of intact ITA and RA. Enhanced production of ROS was induced by exposure of tissues to 28 degrees C. While during exposure to 28 degrees C, basal fluorescence emission was unchanged in ITA rings, it increased significantly in RA rings, indicating enhanced formation of ROS in this peripheral artery.\nData suggest that smoking induces endothelial dysfunction by increasing vascular ROS production. Different levels of endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities and the degree of atherosclerotic changes might modulate physiologic and pharmacologic vasoreactivity and be responsible for decreased graft patency of RA compared with ITA conduits, especially in active smokers.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) has largely focused on reflux. Minimally-invasive techniques to address superficial and perforator reflux have evolved, but correction of deep reflux continues to be challenging. The advent of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) scan and minimally invasive venous stent technology have renewed interest in the obstructive component in CVI pathophysiology. The aim of this study is to assess stent-related and clinical outcomes following treatment by iliac venous stenting alone in limbs with a combination of iliac vein obstruction and deep venous reflux.\nA total of 528 limbs in 504 patients, ranging in age from 15 to 87, underwent IVUS-guided iliac vein stent placement to correct obstruction over an 11-year period. The etiology of obstruction was nonthrombotic in 196 (37%), post-thrombotic in 285 (54%) limbs, and combined in 47 (9%). Clinical severity class of CEAP was C3 in 44%, C(4,5) in 27%, and C6 in 25% of stented limbs. Deep venous reflux was present in all limbs, associated with superficial and/or perforator reflux in 69%. Reflux was severe in 309/528 (59%) limbs (reflux multisegment score > or = 3) and 224/528 (42%) limbs had axial reflux. Venography and other functional tests had poor diagnostic sensitivity to detect obstruction, which was ultimately diagnosed by IVUS. The IVUS-guided iliac vein stenting was the only procedure performed and the associated reflux was left uncorrected.\nThere was no mortality; morbidity was minor. Cumulative secondary stent patency was 88% at 5 years; no stent occlusions occurred in nonthrombotic limbs. Cumulative rates of limbs with healed active ulcers, freedom of ulcer recurrence in legs with healed ulcers (C5), and freedom from leg dermatitis at 5 years were 54%, 88%, and 81%, respectively. Cumulative rate of substantial improvement of pain and swelling at 5 years was 78% and 55%, respectively. Quality of life improved significantly. Reflux parameters did not deteriorate after stenting.\nIliac venous stenting alone is sufficient to control symptoms in the majority of patients with combined outflow obstruction and deep reflux. Partial correction of the pathophysiology in limbs with multisystem or multilevel disease can provide substantial symptom relief. Percutaneous stent technology in concert with other minimally-invasive techniques to address superficial and/or perforator reflux offers such partial correction in limbs with advanced CVI and complex venous pathology. Open correction of obstruction or reflux is now required only infrequently as a \"last resort\".",

    "abstract": "Extracranial carotid stenoses exhibit significant variance in embolic potential, with restenotic lesions having a particularly low propensity for embolization. This study sought to identify characteristics associated with increased generation of embolic debris during carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS).\nCaptured particulate was available for analysis in 56 consecutive patients. Demographics were mean age, 74 years (range, 60-94 years); mean stenosis, 88% (range, 70%-99%); symptomatic, 27%; prior carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 27%; prior radiotherapy, 7%. Plaque echogenicity, heterogenicity, ulceration, and irregularity were assessed with B-mode duplex ultrasound analysis. Gray scale median (GSM) was calculated from normalized B-mode VHS video recordings. Calcification and degree of stenosis were determined angiographically. Captured particulate debris was evaluated for total number; number >200 microm, >500 microm, >1000 microm; mean and median size. Hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and von Kossa stains were used for histologic analysis of captured material.\nRestenotic carotid stenoses after prior CEA generated minimal embolic debris compared with primary stenoses. Four of 15 patients (27%) with restenotic lesions demonstrated embolic particles; all debris was <500 microm. All 41 patients with primary stenoses had some embolic debris; particulate size was >200 microm in 91%, >500 microm in 72%, and >1000 microm in 43%. In primary lesions, the number and size of captured particulate correlated with GSM and with the combined ultrasound findings of echogenicity, heterogenicity, and luminal irregularity/ulceration (P < .02, 95% confidence interval, 4.5-27.6). None of these ultrasound factors correlated independently with embolic particulate (P = NS). Patients aged >70 years exhibited more total particles (8.1 vs 2.3, P = .008) and increased mean particle size (370 vs 157 mum, P = .02). No significant correlation was observed between the number and size of captured embolic particulate and any other variable (stenosis percentage, prior radiotherapy, preprocedural symptoms, periprocedural symptoms, and calcification). Histologically, the embolic debris consisted of extensive amorphous, acellular proteinaceous material. Calcium debris in the embolic particulate was associated with heavily and moderately calcified lesions.\nConsiderable variation exists in the number and size of embolic particles generated during CAS. Embolic potential is positively correlated with lesion GSM and the combination of lesion echogenicity, heterogenicity, and irregularity. Restenosis after prior CEA is associated with minimal embolic particulate generation, suggesting that embolic protection may not be necessary for CAS of restenotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "The integrated vascular surgery residency training paradigm (\"0 + 5\") was first approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in 2006, with the first residents beginning in 2007. We sought to evaluate the demand for these new positions and to better understand applicant pool demographics.\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) was petitioned for data on applicants to traditional vascular surgery fellowship and integrated vascular residency training programs (years 2006-2009). In addition, 111 applications received at a single academic institution for the year 2009 were reviewed in depth.\nThe number of traditional vascular fellowship applicants and the corresponding number of positions remained stable. In contrast, the number of integrated vascular resident applicants increased dramatically, with 152 applicants seeking to match into 19 available positions in 2009. For the year 2009, 88% of integrated vascular residency applicants did not match, while 16% of traditional fellowship positions went unfilled. The most notable difference between integrated residency and traditional fellowship applicants is the number of foreign medical graduates (68.7% vs. 26.7% in 2008, P < .001). Of the 111 integrated applicants applying for our single position (73% of entire 2009 applicant pool), the majority of applicants were residing in the United States (88.3%) and a sizable proportion (25.2%) had completed at least one full year of either surgical training or surgical research at an institution in the Unites States. Objective measures of academic success included mean United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores of 89.1 and 89.5, respectively. The mean number of peer-reviewed journal publications at the time of application was 2.8.\nThe number of integrated vascular surgery residency applicants far outweighs the number of available positions. Growing interest in more efficient and comprehensive vascular surgery training will continue to augment demand. As educators, vascular surgeons should seize this opportunity and aggressively expand the number of available integrated residency training positions.",

    "abstract": "The newly appointed chief of surgery at an open-staff hospital received an application for vascular privileges from a senior general surgeon who took a period of additional fellowship in vascular surgery at a nonacademic regional medical center. The fellowship does not make him board eligible in vascular surgery, but he has maintained his general surgery board certification and the pertinent bylaws do not specifically state which certification is required, only that the surgeon must be board certified and have additional training in vascular surgery. He is a member of a large politically powerful group practice that apparently wants to refer their substantial number of vascular cases internally. The chief of surgery finished vascular surgery training locally 3 years ago. The applicant has a checkered past, with multiple lawsuits and in-house investigations of cases with poor outcomes. The credentialing procedure is that the chief of service makes a recommendation to the chief of staff who makes a recommendation to the board of directors for approval. The chief of staff, who will make the final recommendation to the hospital board of directors, is a member of the applicant's group practice. What recommendation should the chief of vascular surgery make to the chief of staff?",

    "abstract": "Restenosis is one of several complications following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The pathogenesis of restenosis may be related to postsurgery inflammation and leukocyte recruitment mediated by cellular adhesion molecules. In this study, we examine the role of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in carotid neointimal hyperplasia following carotid surgical mechanical de-endothelialization (CSMDE) in a rat model of CEA.\nThe inhibition of siRNA on VCAM-1 protein expression was determined by using the methods of immunostaining and Western blot. Ultrasound imaging and morphometric analysis were applied to measure the degree of CSMDE-induced carotid artery neointimal hyperplasia of rats.\nWe found that a lentivirus-based construct expressing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against VCAM-1 could effectively (P < .05, n = 10 per group) reduce VCAM-1 protein expression in the carotid arteries of rats undergoing CSMDE (CSMDE+RNAi: 135.0 +/- 27.6%) when compared that of CSMDE with scrambled siRNA (CSMDE+CON: 182.7 +/- 36.4%). Doppler ultrasonography revealed that CSMDE+RNAi was accompanied by a significant reduction in the extent of stenosis demonstrated by increased blood velocity (665.85 +/- 48.37 mm/s) and linear diameter (0.59 +/- 0.77 mm) compared to CSMDE+CON (46.72 +/- 28.67 mm/s with undetectable linear diameter, P < .05, n = 10 per group). In addition, morphometric analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections indicated that the intima (innermost layer of media at lesion site)/media area ratio (I/M) was significantly increased (P < .05, n = 10 per group) both in the CSMDE (3.99 +/- 0.65) and CSMDE+CON (4.33 +/- 0.59) groups compared with the SHAM group (0.35 +/- 0.13). However, CSMDE+RNAi resulted in a significant (P < .05, n = 10 per group) decrease in the I/M ratio (1.79 +/- 0.43) compared to CSMDE+CON, whereas there were no significant differences in the total arterial area and medial areas among the groups.\nThese results suggest that perivascular events mediated by VCAM-1 are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of carotid artery neointimal hyperplasia in rats after CSMDE.",

    "abstract": "Wound healing in venous leg ulcer (VLU) is a multi-step process involving complex pathways. Scanty knowledge at molecular level hinders clinical assessment and treatment. Anomalous handling of local iron overload, as well as unbalancing in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and transglutaminase, has a recognized role in VLU establishment. We selected a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes (HFE, FPN1, MMP12, and FXIII) involved in VLU to identify potentially prognostic markers by means of DNA-array technology.\nThe DNA-array-genotyping was assessed in 638 subjects for the following SNPs: HFE (C282Y, H63D), FPN1 (-8CG), MMP12 (-82AG) and FXIII (V34L). Of the subjects, 221 were affected by VLU (171 primary and 50 post-thrombosis), 112 by severe chronic venous disease (CVD) (CEAP, C3-C4), while 305 were matched healthy controls. The HFE and FXIII SNPs had been previously genotyped by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-methods on the same group of subjects (J Vasc Surg 2005;42:309; J Vasc Surg 2006;44:554; J Vasc Surg 2006;44:815). For the purpose of DNA-array, they were re-genotyped by means of array-techniques resulting in a 100% matching. Intergroup statistical comparisons were performed. In the risk computation, the FPN1 -8GG genotype had an overall CVD risk of 4.3 (95% CI, 1.6-12) and a VLU risk of 5.2 (95% CI, 1.9-15) virtually the same among primary VLU (4.98; 95% CI, 1.82-14.9). The MMP12-82AA genotype had a VLU risk of 1.96 (95% CI, 1.18-3.2) only in primary VLU (P = .01). In the genotype-ulcer size association studies, from a subgroup of 167 cases, we observed a smaller mean ulcer size in the MMP12 GG-genotype compared with the other genotypes (P = .001). Combining the present results with our previous published data on the same population, we suggest them to apply as tentative prognostic indicators in primary CVD.\nBy analyzing simultaneously selected SNPs, it might be possible to glean precious information in predicting VLU onset or in stratifying patients according to their potential to heal. Although significant, our findings must be considered preliminary and the proposed prognostic indicators considered with caution, before ulterior more extensive studies in different populations can eventually confirm the present findings.",

    "abstract": "An ideal animal model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is of great importance for clarifying unknown complex mechanisms of the pathogenesis. We introduce a new, simple technique to create reliable AAAs that simulate human aneurysms.\nExperimental models of AAAs were created in 71 rats by means of a 20-minute application of intraluminal elastase (30 U) and extraluminal calcium chloride (0.5M) in the 1-cm segment of infrarenal abdominal aorta (group EC, n = 26). A single application of elastase (group E, n = 24) or calcium chloride (group C, n = 21) was used as control. The treated aorta in each group was measured under physiologic conditions and harvested at 1 and 4 weeks. Successful AAA formation was defined as a dilation ratio >50%. Inflammatory response, elastolytic activity, and histology in the treated aorta were evaluated among the three groups.\nThe surgical procedure in each group was similarly completed for approximate 30 minutes and performed without any technical failure or operative death. At 4 weeks, the dilation ratio and wall thickness were 94.8% +/- 9.9% and 125.4 +/- 5.6 microm in group EC, 43.3% +/- 6.3% and 149.6 +/- 6.5 microm in group E, and 10.9% +/- 4.2% and 152.9 +/- 7.2 microm in group C. The success rate of AAA formation in group EC (92.7%) was significantly higher than that in group E (25.0%) and group C (0.0%). Less elastin content in the aortic wall was observed in group EC. At 1 week, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions were significantly upregulated, and CD3+ and CD11b+ cells were significantly infiltrated into the treated aorta of group EC, compared with groups E or C. Gelatinolytic activities and mRNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were also significantly activated in group EC.\nThe rat AAA model using a combination of intraluminal elastase infusion and extraluminal calcium chloride exposure is simple and easy to perform and is highly reliable and reproducible to create a saccular aneurysm similar to human AAAs. This model could be more useful to clarify AAA pathogenesis, mechanisms, and treatment interventions in experimental researches.",

    "abstract": "To further document the experienced burden in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we compared the health status of patients with PAD and chronic heart failure (CHF). As a secondary aim, we studied clinical and socio-demographic correlates of health status in both conditions.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional observational study in four outpatient clinics in the Southern part of The Netherlands, with subjects consisting of ambulatory (346 PAD and 188 CHF) patients. All patients completed the Short-Form 12 to assess their physical and mental health status. Information about socio-demographic, clinical risk factors, and disease severity indices was obtained from patients' medical records. Propensity methodology was applied to enhance comparability between both medical conditions.\nType of medical condition explained differences in health status (F = 33.1, P < .0001, Effect Size = 0.27). Impaired physical health status was more often reported in PAD patients (48.4%) compared with CHF patients (17.4%, Odds Ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.3-8.8, P < .0001); impaired mental health status was more noted in CHF patients (43.5% vs. 22.0%, OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.6, P = .002). In PAD, younger age (P = .002), low education (P = .02), cardiac history (P = .02), diabetes mellitus (P = .03), and a lower ankle brachial index (P = .003) were associated with worse physical health status; younger age (P = .01) and living without partner (P = .01) were associated with lower mental health status scores. In CHF, patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus (P < .001) and females (P = .001) reported worse physical health, whereas no clinical or socio-demographics were associated with mental health status.\nBy contrasting PAD patients' health status with another chronic disabling condition, the impact of PAD on patients' physical health status became evident; whereas mental health status was more affected in CHF, patients with PAD reported a greater physical burden as compared with CHF patients. PAD patients who were younger, lower-educated, without a partner or had a cardiac history especially reported a higher disease burden. Clinicians need to be aware of these differences in order to develop tailor-made disease management programs for different groups of cardiovascular patients.",

    "abstract": "Vascular access dysfunction is the major cause of morbidity in patients on hemodialysis to treat end stage renal disease. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the perivascular placement of implants containing allogeneic aortic endothelial cells (Vascugel) reduces thrombosis, inflammation, stenosis and increases lumen diameter in porcine models of arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG). We conducted a phase I/II clinical study to investigate the safety of Vascugel placement around the surgical anastomotic sites of newly constructed dialysis accesses.\nFrom July 2006 to August 2006, eight patients (4 AVG, 4 AVF) were treated with two Vascugel sponges at the venous anastomosis in the open-label phase I trial. From January 2007 to August 2007 57 patients (30 AVG and 27 AVF) were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive either Vascugel or control matrices (placebo) at surgery. The phase II AVG patients had sponges placed at both the venous and arterial anastomoses. All patients were followed for 24 weeks. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the safety (incidence of infection, intervention, and thrombosis) of Vascugel compared with placebo within 30 days post-surgery. Secondary endpoints included assessments of patency, lumen diameter, and immunologic sensitization to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) determined by measurement of panel reactive antibodies (PRA).\nThere was no difference in early complication rates between the Vascugel and placebo groups at 4 weeks (10.9% vs 21.1%, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in primary or assisted primary patency between the intent to treat groups at 24 weeks. Vascugel treated AVG had a primary patency rate of 38% and an assisted primary patency rate of 72% (vs 23% and 58%, respectively, for placebo). Vascugel treated AVF had a primary patency rate of 60% at 24 weeks and an assisted primary patency rate of 96% (vs 62% and 88%, respectively, for placebo). A greater than 30% increase in PRA was detected in 9 of the 46 (19.5%) Vascugel treated patients and one of the 19 (5.2%) placebo patients (P = .26) and was not associated with any evidence of local or systemic complications.\nTargeted local therapy with perivascular, allogeneic endothelial cells is a safe and novel therapeutic approach that may be ideally suited to control the response to injury at surgical anastomoses. Larger randomized trials are needed to determine if Vascugel can prolong AVG or AVF patency.",

    "abstract": "Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is characterized by combined stenoses of the principal pathways of extracranial venous drainage, including the internal jugular veins (IJVs) and the azygous (AZY) vein, with development of collateral circles and insufficient drainage shown by increased mean transit time in cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion studies. CCSVI is strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the safety of CCSVI endovascular treatment and its influence on the clinical outcome of the associated MS.\nSixty-five consecutive patients with CCSVI, subdivided by MS clinical course into 35 with relapsing remitting (RR), 20 with secondary progressive (SP), and 10 with primary progressive (PP) MS, underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Mean follow-up was 18 months. Vascular outcome measures were postoperative complications, venous pressure, and patency rate. Neurologic outcome measures were cognitive and motor function assessment, rate of MS relapse, rate of MR active positive-enhanced gadolinium MS lesions (Gad+), and quality of life (QOL) MS questionnaire.\nOutpatient endovascular treatment of CCSVI was feasible, with a minor and negligible complication rate. Postoperative venous pressure was significantly lower in the IJVs and AZY (P < .001). The risk of restenosis was higher in the IJVs compared with the AZY (patency rate: IJV, 53%; AZY, 96%; odds ratio, 16; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-72.5; P < .0001). CCSVI endovascular treatment significantly improved MS clinical outcome measures, especially in the RR group: the rate of relapse-free patients changed from 27% to 50% postoperatively (P < .001) and of MR Gad+ lesions from 50% to 12% (P < .0001). The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite at 1 year improved significantly in RR patients (P < .008) but not in PP or SP. Physical QOL improved significantly in RR (P < .01) and in PP patients (P < .03), with a positive trend in SP (P < .08). Mental QOL showed significant improvement in RR (P < .003) and in PP (P < .01), but not in SP.\nPTA of venous strictures in patients with CCSVI is safe, and especially in patients with RR, the clinical course positively influenced clinical and QOL parameters of the associated MS compared with the preoperative assessment. Restenosis rates are elevated in the IJVs but very promising in the AZY, suggesting the need to improve endovascular techniques in the former. The results of this pilot study warrant a subsequent randomized control study.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the Viabahn Open Revascularization Technique (VORTEC) in the treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) and pararenal aortic aneurysms (PAAAs) by hybrid procedures.\nBetween December 2004 and March 2009, 58 patients (45 male, mean age, 74 years) were diagnosed with TAAA (n = 30) and PAAA (n = 28) and treated electively by combined hybrid techniques. Hybrid procedure includes bypass surgery of the visceral and renal arteries (debranching or rerouting), followed by endovascular exclusion of the aortic aneurysm. One hundred thirteen renovisceral vessels were revascularized in a retrograde fashion (ie, 98 renal and 15 visceral arteries), using VORTEC. The novel technique consists of the placement of self-expanding stent-grafts (Viabahn graft, Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) in Seldinger technique into the renal and visceral arteries after surgical identification of the origin of the arteries. The end of the stent outside of the renal artery was sutured end to side directly with the main feeding graft, bypassing the aneurysm, or was fixed into an interposition branch graft on the main bypass. All cases were treated by two-staged approach (endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR] performed after recovery from the debranching procedure). Computed tomography angiography and clinical follow-up were obtained before discharge, at six weeks, and three, six, and 12 months after the procedure and then annually.\nPrimary technical success of VORTEC was achieved in all patients. Overall primary patency rate of the novel technique was 97% during a mean follow-up of 22.1 +/- 12.9 months (range, 1-52 months); the primary patency of the subgroups PAAAs and TAAAs was 97.7% and 96.4%, respectively; the assisted primary patency rate was 98%, as two occluded Viabahn grafts were reopened by thrombolysis and thrombus aspiration. No patient required long-term hemodialysis. Thirty-day mortality rate was 8.6% (5/58) and 25.8% (15/58) for the entire follow up. Permanent neurologic deficit occurred in two cases (3.4%; paraplegia, n = 1; paraparesis, n = 1). The overall endoleak rate was 17.1% as three patients presented early (30-day) type I endoleak, treated by cuff-implantation, and six patients presented type II endoleak, three of them treated by coil embolization of the patent vessel and the others treated conservatively with radiological surveillance.\nVORTEC allows performance of easy, safe, and minimally invasive revascularization of renal and visceral arteries and may represent a significant technical advance in the hybrid repair of TAAAs and PAAAs. However, the questions of reproducibility by other centers and long-term results are mandatory to establish this alternative revascularization option.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is applicable to a spectrum of thoracic aortic pathology with half of the procedures performed world-wide for indications other than degenerative aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). This multicenter, prospective study queried perioperative and one-year results of TEVAR using the commercially available GORE TAG device, in the treatment of acute complicated Type B dissection (cTBD), traumatic aortic tear (TT), and ruptured degenerative aneurysm (RDA) of the DTA.\nThis prospective, non-randomized, literature controlled study included 59 patients; cTBD, n = 19; RDA, n = 20; TT, n = 20. The primary end-point was the composite of death and total paraplegia in subjects at <or= 30 days post-treatment compared with a cohort from current literature. Secondary end-points included adverse events related to device, procedural and systemic complications, and one-year survival.\nAll 59 patients had successful endoprosthesis deployment. Fifteen of 19 (79%) patients in the cTBD group had either rupture or malperfusion syndromes at presentation.

    "abstract": "Preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of cardiac disease in patients undergoing vascular surgery (VS) is important for patients and vascular surgeons. Recent evidence has emerged that has allowed us to develop contemporary paradigms for evaluating and managing coronary artery disease in VS patients perioperatively.\nThe utility of stress testing, the role of preoperative coronary revascularization, the optimal use of beta-blockers and statins, and the role of antiplatelet therapy in VS patients were reviewed in the literature.\nThe revised Lee cardiac risk index, based on the number of risk factors (high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hypertension, and age >75) quantitates cardiac risk. Stress testing is not predictive of myocardial ischemia/infarction (MI) or death and is only recommended in patients with unstable angina or an active arrhythmia. Stress testing for patients with 0 to 2 risk factors delays VS up to 3 weeks. In high-risk patients (>or=3 risk factors), it helps to identify patients who may develop myocardial ischemia and would benefit from a 30-day period to optimize medical therapy before VS. Stress testing and coronary catheterization do not predict which coronary artery to revascularize to prevent MI or death. Revascularization does not decrease MI or death rates at 1 month or 6 years. Although beta-blocker treatment decreases cardiac risk with VS, timing and dosage (titration) influence outcomes, improper usage may increase stroke and death rate, and not all VS patients should be taking these drugs. Patients with >or=1 risk factor should be considered to begin a low dose beta-blocker 1 month before VS. Preoperative statin use sharply decreases MI, stroke, and death perioperatively and long-term postoperatively.\nRoutine stress testing should not be performed before VS. The Lee index should be used to stratify risk in patients undergoing VS. Patients with >or=3 risk factors or active cardiac conditions should undergo stress testing, if VS can be delayed. All VS patients, except those with 0 risk factors, should be considered for a beta-blocker (bisoprolol, 2.5-5 mg/d started 1 month before VS, titrated to a pulse <70 beats/min and a systolic blood pressure >or=120 mm Hg). Intermediate risk factors may not require aggressive heart rate control but simply maintenance on a low-dose beta-blocker. Statins should be started (ideally 30 days) before all VS using long-acting formulations such as fluvastatin (80 mg/d) for patients unable to take oral medication.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need for vascular grafts in the field of surgical revascularization. However, smaller vascular grafts made from synthetic biomaterials, particularly those <5 mm in diameter, are associated with a high incidence of thrombosis. Fibroin is a biodegradable protein derived from silk. Silk fibroin from Bombyx mori provides an antithrombotic surface and serves as a scaffold for various cell types in tissue engineering. We evaluated the potential of fibroin to generate a vascular prosthesis for small arteries.\nA small vessel with three layers was woven from silk fibroin thread. These fibroin-based grafts (1.5 mm diameter, 10 mm length) were implanted into the abdominal aorta of 10- to 14-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats by end-to-end anastomosis. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based grafts were used as the control. To investigate the origin of the cells in the neointima and media, bone marrow transplantation was performed from green fluorescent protein (GFP) rats to wild-type rats.\nThe patency of fibroin grafts at 1 year after implantation was significantly higher than that of PTFE grafts (85.1% vs 30%, P < .01). Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) migrated into the fibroin graft early after implantation and became organized into endothelial and medial layers, as determined by anti-CD31 and anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin immunostaining. The total number of SMCs increased 1.6-fold from 1 month to 3 months. Vasa vasorum also formed in the adventitia. Sirius red staining of the fibroin grafts revealed that the content of collagen significantly increased at 1 year after implantation, with a decrease in fibroin content. GFP-positive cells contributed to organization of a smooth muscle layer.\nSmall-diameter fibroin-based vascular grafts have excellent long-term patency. Bone marrow-derived cells contribute to vascular remodeling after graft implantation. Fibroin might be a promising material to engineer vascular prostheses for small arteries.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the rates of postoperative infectious complications and death after elective vascular surgery, define vascular procedures with the greatest risk of developing nosocomial infections, and assess the effect of infection on health care resource utilization.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2006) was used to identify major vascular procedures by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Infectious complications identified included pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI), postoperative sepsis, and surgical site infections (SSI). Case-mix-adjusted rates were calculated using a multivariate logistic regression model for infectious complication or death as an outcome and indirect standardization.\nA total of 870,778 elective vascular surgical procedures were estimated and evaluated with an overall postoperative infection rate of 3.70%. Open abdominal aortic surgery had the greatest rate of postoperative infections, followed by open thoracic procedures and aorta-iliac-femoral bypass. Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) infectious complication rates were two times greater than after EVAR (P < .0001). Pneumonia was the most common infectious complication after open aortic surgery (6.63%). UTI was the most common after TEVAR (2.86%) and EVAR (1.31%). Infectious complications were greater in octogenarians (P < .0002), women (P < .0001), and blacks (P < .0001 vs whites and Hispanics). Nosocomial infections after elective vascular surgery significantly increased hospital length of stay (13.8 +/- 15.4 vs 3.5 +/- 4.2 days; P < .001) and reported total hospital cost ($37,834 +/- $42,905 vs $11,851 +/- $11,816; P < .001).\nElective vascular surgical procedures vary widely in the estimated risk of postoperative infection. Open aortic surgery and endarterectomy of the head and neck vessels have, respectively, the greatest and the lowest reported incidence for postoperative infectious complications. Women, octogenarians, and blacks have the highest risk of infectious complications after elective vascular surgery. Disparities in the development of infectious complications on a systems level were also found in larger hospitals and teaching hospitals. Hospital infectious complications were found to significantly increase health care resource utilization. Strategies that reduce nosocomial complications and target high-risk procedures may offer significant future cost savings.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) can be limited by inadequate proximal and distal landing zones. Debranching or hybrid TEVAR has emerged as an important modality to expand landing zones and facilitate TEVAR. We report a single-center experience with hybrid TEVAR.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients with thoracic aortic disease who received a TEVAR between February 2005 and October 2008.\nForty-two patients underwent a hybrid procedure (mean age 68 +/- 13 years; 55% men). All patients were denied open surgery due to preoperative comorbidities or low physiologic reserve; 62% had a history of coronary artery disease, 67% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 61% had undergone prior aortic surgery, and 90% had an American Society of Anesthesiology score of 4 and above. The average Society for Vascular Surgery comorbidity score was 12 +/- 2 with a range of 9 to 14. Fifty-five percent of cases were symptomatic on presentation and 83% were done emergently. Seventy-six percent underwent debranching of the aortic arch, 17% of the visceral vessels, and 7% required both. Primary technical success was achieved in all cases and of these, 43% were staged. The 30-day mortality was 5%. Myocardial infarction developed in 5%, respiratory failure in 31%, cerebrovascular accident (stroke or transient ischemic attack) in 19%, and spinal cord ischemia with ensuant paraplegia occurred in 5% of patients. Fifty-eight percent of patients were discharged home, 11% required rehabilitation, and 29% were transferred to a skilled nursing facility. There was a significant association between visceral vessel debranching and both spinal cord ischemia (P = .004) and gastrointestinal complications (P = .005). On the other hand, there was no difference between staged and non-staged hybrid procedures.\nHybrid procedures can successfully extend the range of patients suitable for a subsequent TEVAR. These procedures are associated with higher complication rates than isolated infrarenal or thoracic endovascular repair, but given the medical and anatomical complexity of these patients, the current results are quite encouraging.",

The average Society for Vascular Surgery comorbidity score was 12 +/- 2 with a range of 9 to 14. Fifty-five percent of cases were symptomatic on presentation and 83% were done emergently. Seventy-six percent underwent debranching of the aortic arch, 17% of the visceral vessels, and 7% required both. Primary technical success was achieved in all cases and of these, 43% were staged. The 30-day mortality was 5%. Myocardial infarction developed in 5%, respiratory failure in 31%, cerebrovascular accident (stroke or transient ischemic attack) in 19%, and spinal cord ischemia with ensuant paraplegia occurred in 5% of patients. Fifty-eight percent of patients were discharged home, 11% required rehabilitation, and 29% were transferred to a skilled nursing facility. There was a significant association between visceral vessel debranching and both spinal cord ischemia (P = .004) and gastrointestinal complications (P = .005). On the other hand, there was no difference between staged and non-staged hybrid procedures.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVI) has improved with widespread adaptation of screening protocols and more accurate multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT-A) angiography. The population at risk and for whom screening is indicated is still controversial. To help determine which blunt trauma patients would best benefit from screening we performed a comprehensive analysis of risk factors associated with BCVI.\nAll patients with BCVI from June 12, 2000 (the date at which our institution began screening for these injuries) to June 30, 2009 were identified by the primary author (JDB) and recorded in a prospective database. Associated injuries were identified retrospectively by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code and compared with similar patients without BCVI. Demographic information was also compared from data obtained from the trauma registry. Univariate analyses exploring associations between individual risk factors and BCVI were performed using Fisher's exact test for dichotomous variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Additionally, relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous variables to describe the strength of the relationship between the categorical risk factors and BCVI. Multivariate logistic regression models for BCVI, BCAI (blunt internal carotid artery injury), and BVAI (blunt vertebral artery injury) were developed to explore the relative contributions of the various risk factors.\nOne hundred two patients with BCVI were identified out of 9935 blunt trauma patients admitted during this time period (1.03% incidence). Fifty-nine patients (0.59% incidence) had a BVAI and 43 patients (0.43% incidence) had a BCAI. Univariate analysis found cervical spine fracture (CSI) (RR = 10.4), basilar skull fracture (RR = 3.60), and mandible fracture (RR = 2.51) to be most predictive of the presence of BCVI (P < .005). Independent predictors of BCVI on multivariate logistic regression were CSI (OR = 7.46), mandible fracture (OR = 2.59), basilar skull fracture (OR = 1.76), injury severity score (ISS) (OR = 1.05), and emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale (ED-GCS) (OR = 0.93): all P < .05.\nBlunt trauma patients with a high risk mechanism and a low GCS, high injury severity score, mandible fracture, basilar skull fracture, or cervical spine injury are at high risk for BCVI should be screened with MDCT-A.",

    "abstract": "To develop a set of suggested objective performance goals (OPG) for evaluating new catheter-based treatments in critical limb ischemia (CLI), based on evidence from historical controls.\nRandomized, controlled trials of surgical, endovascular, and pharmacologic/biologic treatments for CLI were reviewed according to specified criteria regarding study population and data quality. Line-item data were obtained for selected studies from the sponsor/funding agency. A set of specific outcome measures was defined in accordance with the treatment goals for the CLI population. Risk factors were examined for their influence on key endpoints, and models of stratification based on specific clinical and anatomic variables developed. Sample size estimates were made for single-arm trial designs based on comparison to the suggested OPG.\nBypass with autogenous vein was considered the established standard, and data compiled from three individual randomized, controlled trials (N = 838) was analyzed. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as perioperative (30-day) death or any major adverse limb event (amputation or major reintervention) occurring within one year. Results of open surgery controls demonstrated freedom from the primary endpoint in 76.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74.0%-79.9%) of patients at one year, with amputation-free survival (AFS) of 76.5% (95% CI 73.7%-79.5). An additional 3% non-inferiority margin was suggested in generating OPG for catheter-based therapies. Defined clinical (age > 80 years and tissue loss) and anatomic (infra-popliteal anatomy or lack of good quality saphenous vein) risk subgroups provided significantly different point estimates and OPG threshold values.\nFor new catheter-based therapies in CLI, OPGs offer a feasible approach for pre-market evaluation using non-randomized trial designs. Such studies should incorporate risk stratification in design and reporting as the CLI population is heterogeneous with respect to baseline variables and expected outcomes. Guidelines for CLI trial design to address consistency in study cohorts, methods of assessment, and endpoint definitions are provided.",

This article identifies a number of key challenges with conducting and comparing CLI trials, including the wide spectrum of clinical presentations that CLI encompasses, the use of disparate eligibility criteria and endpoint measurements, and logistical and economic considerations that can limit study initiation and completion. The authors propose definitions for a number of performance goals derived from historical surgical literature as a means of reducing the negative impact of these factors.

    "abstract": "Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at high risk of secondary cardiovascular death and events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. To minimize this elevated risk, cardiovascular risk factors should be treated in all PAD patients. Secondary risk management may benefit from a prediction tool to identify PAD patients at the highest risk who could be referred for an additional extensive workup. Stratifying PAD patients according to their risk of secondary events could aid in achieving optimal therapy compliance. To this end we developed a prediction model for secondary cardiovascular events in PAD patients.\nThe model was developed using data from 800 PAD patients who participated in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort study. From the baseline characteristics, 13 candidate predictors were selected for the model development. Missing values were imputed by means of single regression imputation. Continuous predictors were truncated and transformed where necessary, followed by model reduction by means of backward stepwise selection. To correct for over-fitting, a bootstrapping technique was applied. Finally, a score chart was created that divides patients in four risk categories that have been linked to the risk of a cardiovascular event during 1- and 5-year follow-up.\nDuring a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, 120 events occurred (27% nonfatal myocardial infarction, 21% nonfatal stroke, and 52% mortality from vascular causes), corresponding to a 1- and 5-year cumulative incidence of 3.1% and 13.2%, respectively. Important predictors for the secondary risk of a cardiovascular event are age, history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking behavior, ankle-brachial pressure index, and creatinine level. The risk of a cardiovascular event in a patient as predicted by the model was 0% to 10% and 1% to 28% for the four risk categories at 1- and 5-year follow-up, respectively. The discriminating capacity of the prediction model, indicated by the c statistic, was 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.80).\nA prediction model can be used to predict secondary cardiovascular risk in PAD patients. We propose such a prediction model to allow for the identification of PAD patients at the highest risk of a cardiovascular event or cardiovascular death, which may be a viable tool in vascular secondary health care practice.",

    "abstract": "We sought to directly compare the effects of type 1 and type 2 diabetes on postischemic neovascularization and evaluate the mechanisms underlying differences between these groups. We tested the hypothesis that type 2 diabetic mice have a greater reduction in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, a greater increase in oxidative stress, and reduced arteriogenesis and angiogenesis, resulting in less complete blood flow recovery than type 1 diabetic mice after induction of hind limb ischemia.\nHind limb ischemia was generated by femoral artery excision in streptozotocin-treated mice (model of type 1 diabetes), in Lepr(db/db) mice (model of type 2 diabetes), and in control (C57BL/6) mice. Dependent variables included eNOS expression and markers of arteriogenesis, angiogenesis, and oxidative stress.\nPostischemia recovery of hind limb perfusion was significantly less in type 2 than in type 1 diabetic mice; however, neither group demonstrated a significant increase in collateral artery diameter or collateral artery angioscore in the ischemic hind limb. The capillary/myofiber ratio in the gastrocnemius muscle decreased in response to ischemia in control or type 1 diabetic mice but remained the same in type 2 diabetic mice. Gastrocnemius muscle eNOS expression was lower in type 1 and 2 diabetic mice than in control mice. This expression decreased after induction of ischemia in type 2 but not in type 1 diabetic mice. The percentage of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in the peripheral blood failed to increase in either diabetic group after induction of ischemia, whereas this variable significantly increased in the control group in response to ischemia. EPC eNOS expression decreased after induction of ischemia in type 1 but not in type 2 diabetic mice. EPC nitrotyrosine accumulation increased after induction of ischemia in type 2 but not in type 1 diabetic mice.

    "abstract": "Few options other than amputation exist for some patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) and severe anatomical limitations.\nThis prospective study presents short-term results of dual intramuscular and intra-arterial autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) implantation for the treatment of patients with severe PAD in whom amputation was considered the only viable treatment option. Baseline, two-week, and three-month evaluations were conducted. Ankle brachial indices (ABI) were calculated for both the dorsal pedis and the posterior tibial arteries. Rest pain and ulcer healing also were assessed. Success was defined as meeting the following four criteria: improvement in ABI measurements; relief of rest pain; ulcer healing, if applicable; and absence of major limb amputations. Patients not undergoing major limb amputations continued to be monitored for subsequent procedures.\nNine patients for whom limb amputation was recommended underwent this procedure. The study population was comprised of five females and four males, with a mean age of 61.7 years. Eight (88.9%) patients had rest pain. Seven (77.8%) patients also had diabetes. Non-healing ulcers were present in eight (88.9%) cases. After the procedure, non-significant improvements of 0.12 and 0.08 in ABI were observed for the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial ankle arteries, respectively. Three (33.3%) major amputations subsequently were performed, including a below-knee amputation 4.1 weeks after the BM-MNC implantation and two above-knee amputations at 5.4 and 11.0 weeks after the procedure. The six (66.7%) patients who did not have major amputations demonstrated improvement in symptom severity three months after the procedure, as evidenced by alleviation of rest pain and improvements by at least one level in Rutherford and Fontaine classifications, and have not required amputations at a mean follow-up of 7.8 months. Complete wound healing was achieved within three months in all patients who had ulcers prior to BM-MNC implantation and for whom amputation was not required. This specific BM-MNC implantation technique was fully successful in three (33.3%) patients, as major amputation was avoided and the other applicable criteria were met. Five (55.6%) additional patients demonstrated success in at least one of the four criteria.\nWith eight (88.9%) of nine patients showing some level of improvement and amputation avoided in six (66.7%) patients, these short-term results indicate the use of BM-MNC implantation as a means of limb salvage therapy for patients with severe PAD shows promise in postponing or avoiding amputation in a patient population currently presented with few alternatives to amputation.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (LE PTA) is currently performed by a variety of endovascular specialists. We hypothesized that cardiologists (CRD) and vascular surgeons (VAS) may have different practice patterns, indications for intervention, and hospital resource utilization.\nUsing the State Inpatient Databases for New Jersey (2003-2007), patients with elective admission undergoing PTA procedures with indications of claudication, rest pain, and gangrene/ulceration were examined. Physician specialty was determined based on all procedures performed. We contrasted by specialty, the indication for LE PTA for the procedure, volume, and hospital resource utilization.\nOf the 1887 cases of LE PTA, VAS performed 866 (45.9%) and CRD 1021 (54.1%) procedures. The mean patient age was 68.0 years (CRD) vs 70.7 years (VAS), P = .0163. Indications for intervention were compared for CRD vs VAS: claudication 80.7% vs 60.7%, (P < .002); rest pain 6.2% vs 16.0%, (P < .002); gangrene/ulceration 13.1% vs 23.3%, (P < .002). Stents (64.8% of cases) were utilized similarly among physicians (P = .18), and mean hospital length of stay were similar (2.38 days vs 2.41 days, P = .85). Hospital charges by indication varied between CRD vs VAS (all procedures: $49,748 vs $42,158 [P < .0001]). Revenue center charges were different between CRD vs VAS: medical surgical supply $19,128 vs $12,737, (P < .0001); pharmacy $1,959 vs $1,115, (P < .0001). Only 10.7% of CRD were high volume practitioners, compared with 36.8% among VAS (P < .05). High volume practitioners had significantly lower hospital charges ($41,730 vs $51,014, P < .001).\nCardiologists performing lower extremity angioplasty were more likely to treat patients with claudication than those with rest pain or gangrene/ulceration. Despite treating younger patients with less severe peripheral vascular disease, cardiologists used significantly greater hospital resources. High practitioner volume, regardless of specialty, was associated with lower hospital resource utilization. Reducing variations in indication and practitioner volume may offer substantial cost savings for lower extremity endovascular interventions.",

    "abstract": "Occlusion of the ulnar artery is found in a substantial proportion of elderly patients. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ulnar artery occlusion in a sample of the general population of France, look for its risk factors, and evaluate its clinical correlates.\nThis study was an offshoot of a cross-sectional epidemiologic study in the general population of four locations in France (Tarentaise, Grenoble, Nyons, and Toulon). In phase I, random samples of 2000 individuals per location aged >or=18 years old were interviewed by phone for screening of Raynaud phenomenon. In phase II, subsamples of individuals were invited to a medical interview and physical examination where the presence of Raynaud phenomenon and occupational risk factors were recorded and a bilateral clinical Allen test was performed for the detection of ulnar artery occlusion. Phase II comprised 688 women and 335 men.\nIn 36 men and seven women, at least one occluded ulnar artery was found. The estimated prevalence was 9.6% in men and 1.0% in women (P < .001). The occluded artery was more often in the dominant hand of both men (8.1% vs 2.4%; P < .001) and women (0.9% vs 0.4%; P = .34). Ulnar artery occlusion was found more often in men aged >50 years (16.4%) than in younger men (1.4%; P < .001). Besides age, male sex, and dominant side, the only independent risk factor was an occupational exposure in men to repeated palmar trauma, with a significant quantitative relationship in the frequency of the impacts (P < .001) and the duration of the exposure (P < .001). Exposures to hand-held vibrating tools and cigarette smoking did not show a significant relationship in the multivariate analysis. Most individuals with ulnar artery occlusion did not have associated complaints; however, the diagnostic criteria for Raynaud phenomenon was validated in 13 of the 36 affected men. The association remained significant after adjusting for occupational exposure to vibrating tools. One individual reported a previous episode consistent with an attack of permanent digital ischemia.\nThis study confirms a substantial prevalence of ulnar artery occlusions in the general population, mostly in middle-aged and elderly men, which appears to be principally related to an occupational exposure to repeated occupational palmar trauma. Although there is a significant association with Raynaud phenomenon, most often the consequences of this occlusion remain subclinical.",

    "abstract": "Subclinical microemboli on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) have been identified immediately following carotid revascularization procedures, but the clinical significance and long-term effects are largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term radiographic outcomes of these DWI lesions.\nPatients who underwent perioperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations for carotid interventions at a single institution from July 2004 to December 2008 were evaluated, particularly those who had additional follow-up MRI. DWI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted MRI images were compared to determine long-term effect of microemboli.\nOne-hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients (68 carotid artery stenting [CAS] and 100 carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) who received perioperative MRI were included. All CAS were performed with an embolic protection device. The incidence of microemboli was significantly higher in the CAS group than the CEA group (46.3% and 12%, respectively, P < .05) despite a relative low incidence of procedure-associated neurologic symptoms in both groups (2.9% vs 2%). Thirty patients (16 CAS and 14 CEA) who had follow-up MRI were further analyzed and a total of 50 postoperative DWI lesions (mean size 46.57 mm(2); range 16 to 128 mm(2)) were identified among them. During a mean MRI follow-up of 10 months (range, 2 to 23 months), residual MRI abnormalities were only identified in DWI lesions larger than 60 mm(2) on postoperative MRI and on postoperative FLAIR images (n = 5, P < .001). The CEA group had fewer but larger ipsilateral distributed emboli (total 12 lesions, mean 79 mm(2)) compared with the CAS group (total 38 lesions, mean 27.5 mm(2), P < .05).\nThe majority of microemboli do not have long-term radiographic sequelae. Size and hyperintensity on postoperative FLAIR are predictive of residual brain structure abnormality, and further neurocognitive evaluations are warranted.",

The proximal landing zone was zone 0 in 10 patients (11%), zone 1 in 24 patients (27%), and zone 2 in 54 patients (61%). Debranching procedures of the supra-aortic vessels were performed in patients who were to undergo zone 0 or zone 1 deployment. Primary LSA revascularization was performed in 22 of the 88 patients (25%) at a median of 6 days before TEVAR. Median follow-up was 26.4 months (1-98 months).\nTechnical success was achieved in 97%. Five primary (9%) and two secondary (4%) type Ia endoleaks in patients who underwent zone 2 deployment were observed and required further interventions. Fourteen (16%) primary type II endoleaks were observed; 10 of them fed by the LSA. Paraplegia rate was lower in patients with LSA coverage without revascularization than in other patients (1.5% vs 1.9%; odds ratio [OR], 0.774; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.038-6.173; P = 1.000). Prior or concomitant infrarenal aortic replacement (P = .0019), renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) (P = .0024) and long segment aortic coverage (>200 mm) (P = .0157) were associated with significant higher risk of postoperative paraplegia. Stroke rate was lower in patients with LSA coverage without revascularization than in other patients (3% vs 3.9%; OR, 0.570; 95% CI, 0.118-2.761; P = .7269). Two patients (3%) developed left upper extremity symptoms and another two patients (3%) subclavian steal syndrome and required secondary LSA revascularization. The technical success rate for LSA revascularization was 94%.\nBy using a selective approach to the LSA revascularization, coverage of the LSA can be used to extend the proximal seal zone for TEVAR without increasing the risk of spinal cord ischemia or stroke. Indications for revascularization include long segment aortic coverage, prior or concomitant infrarenal aortic replacement, and renal insufficiency.

    "abstract": "In 1994, our hospital reported a significant gender disparity in the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The objective of this study was to determine if this gender-based treatment disparity still persists after 15 years.\nA retrospective review of patients with PAD and carotid artery disease based on vascular laboratory studies was performed from January 2006 to February 2008. PAD was identified by ankle-brachial index <or= 0.9 or abnormal waveform. Treatable carotid artery disease was identified by symptomatic stenosis 60%-99% or asymptomatic stenosis 80%-99%. Patients with interventions before January 2006 were excluded. Demographics, risk factors, and interventions were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors and independent predictors of intervention.\nOf 2,313 peripheral artery studies, 592 patients with PAD and no prior intervention were identified. Sixty-five (21.7%) of 299 men and 47 (16.0%) of 293 women underwent angioplasty, stenting, endarterectomy, or bypass grafting. This difference was not significant (P = .077). However, by multivariate analysis of patients with critical limb ischemia, Caucasian race was an independent predictor of intervention (P = .010; odds ratio [OR] 3.363). Of 3,505 carotid duplex studies, 253 patients with treatable carotid artery disease and no prior intervention were identified. Seventy-eight (52.7%) of 148 men and 43 (41.0%) of 105 women underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting. This difference was not significant (P = .065). However, by multivariate analysis, Caucasian race was identified as an independent predictor of intervention (P = .015, OR 3.033). Insurance status was not a predictor of intervention in either the PAD (P = .70) or carotid artery disease cohort (P = .99).\nOur data reveal that gender was not an independent predictor of intervention for PAD or carotid artery disease; however, Caucasian race independently predicted a greater likelihood of intervention in PAD patients with critical limb ischemia and in the carotid artery disease cohort.

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is commonly used as a minimally invasive technique for repairing infrarenal aortic aneurysms. There have been recent concerns that a subset of high-risk patients experience unfavorable outcomes with this intervention. To determine whether such a high-risk cohort exists and to identify the characteristics of these patients, we analyzed the outcomes of Medicare patients treated with EVAR from 2000-2006.\nWe identified 66,943 patients who underwent EVAR from Inpatient Medicare database. The overall 30-day mortality was 1.6%. A risk model for perioperative mortality was developed by randomly selecting 44,630 patients; the other one third of the dataset was used to validate the model. The model was deemed reliable (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics were P = .25 for the development, P = .24 for the validation model) and accurate (c = 0.735 and c = 0.731 for the development and the validation model, respectively).\nIn our scoring system, where scores ranged between 1 and 7, the following were identified as significant baseline factors that predict mortality: renal failure with dialysis (score = 7); renal failure without dialysis (score = 3); clinically significant lower extremity ischemia (score = 5); patient age >or=85 years (score = 3), 75-84 years (score = 2), 70-74 years (score = 1); heart failure (score = 3); chronic liver disease (score = 3); female gender (score = 2); neurological disorders (score = 2); chronic pulmonary disease (score = 2); surgeon experience in EVAR <3 procedures (score = 1); and hospital annual volume in EVAR <7 procedures (score = 1). The majority of Medicare patients who were treated (96.6%, n = 64,651) had a score of 9 or less, which correlated with a mortality <5%. Only 3.4% of patients had a mortality >or=5% and 0.8% of patients (n = 509) had a score of 13 or higher, which correlated with a mortality >10%.\nWe conclude that there is a high-risk cohort of patients that should not be treated with EVAR because of prohibitively high mortality; however, this cohort is small. Our scoring system, which is based on patient and institutional factors, provides criteria that can be easily used by clinicians to quantify perioperative risk for EVAR candidates.",

    "abstract": "Stent grafts are increasingly recognized as useful devices for endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms and other vascular diseases. Stent graft-mediated gene delivery into the vascular wall is expected to improve their therapeutic effects. This study evaluated the efficacy of genetically engineered cationized gelatin (CG) hydrogel-coated partially-covered polyester stent grafts that facilitate delivery of an expression plasmid DNA in rabbit aortic wall.\nPartially covered polyester stent grafts coated with CG hydrogel impregnated with 10.0 mg/mL of beta-galactosidase (LacZ)-expression plasmid vector (pCAGGS-LacZ) or empty vector (pCAGGS) solutions were implanted via the femoral artery in rabbit balloon-injured aortas. The aortic segments were removed at 1, 3, or 7 days (4 rabbits/each group) after implantation and evaluated for the transgene (LacZ) delivery and expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside) staining. Partially-covered polyester stent grafts coated with CG hydrogel impregnated with various amounts (0.1 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL, and 10.0 mg/mL) of pCAGGS-LacZ or pCAGGS were also implanted in rabbits' balloon-injured aortas (4 rabbits/each group) to evaluate transgene delivery and expression in the aortic wall 3 days after implantation. The difference of transgene efficiency among each group was compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-Keuls' test according to the result of quantitative RT-PCR.\nIn all animals, LacZ gene transduction into the aortic wall was detected at the implantation site of pCAGGS-LacZ-loaded, but not pCAGGS-loaded, stent grafts. LacZ expression was not detected in aortic segments immediately proximal or distal to the implanted pCAGGS-LacZ-loaded stent graft or remote organs including the brain, heart, liver, and kidney by either RT-PCR or X-gal staining. The X-gal staining-positive cells were observed at or near the luminal surface in the aortic segments only in contact with the stent graft and the ingrowth tissues within stent grafts. Immunohistochemical studies suggested that the LacZ-positive cells were mainly the neointimal alpha-smooth-muscle actin-positive cells and macrophages. The extent of the transgene expression was dependent on the quantity of the plasmid DNA loaded onto the stent graft (10.0 mg/mL plasmid vs 1.0 mg/mL plasmid, P < .01 and 10.0 mg/mL plasmid vs 0.1 mg/mL plasmid, P < .05). LacZ mRNA expression was maximal at day 1 and declined at day 7 (P < .05) but was still detectable.\nPlasmid-loaded CG hydrogel-coated stent graft is a promising vehicle for local transgene delivery to the aortic wall and offers the possibility of transduction of therapeutic genes into the vascular wall.",

LacZ mRNA expression was maximal at day 1 and declined at day 7 (P < .05) but was still detectable.",

    "abstract": "Four patients with high internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease were indicated for surgical endarterectomy and needed additional exposure besides regular head rotation and extension. When indicated, in our clinic this is usually achieved by mandibular subluxation with interdental wiring. Due to dental wear and periodontal disease, all 4 patients were edentulous. As a consequence, the technique of interdental wiring could not be used. In this technical note we will explain a method for interarch fixation with the use of two ipsilateral monocortical miniscrews and wiring, and the use of patients' pre-existing mandibular implants and provisional overdenture. This method gives rise to an additional exposure of 15 to 20 mm of the ICA.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Apart from traditional cardiovascular risk factors, several novel biologic mediators and genetic predisposing factors appear relevant in determining the atherogenetic process leading to PAD. Genes encoding for renin angiotensin system (RAS) components have been proposed as candidate in atherosclerosis. This study investigated four polymorphisms in angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), genes of RAS, in both predicting PAD and modulating the severity of the disease.\nThe ACE I/D and -240A>T, AGT M235T, and AGTR1 1166A>C polymorphisms were analyzed in 281 PAD patients and in 485 controls comparable for age and sex.\nThe ACE D and -240T alleles both significantly influenced the predisposition to PAD. The ACE D, but not -240 T, allele remained associated with PAD after Bonferroni correction (P = .004) and adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (P = .03). The ACE D allele influenced PAD predisposition with a dose-dependent effect (odds ratio for ACE ID vs II genotype, 1.77; P = .006; ACE DD vs II genotype, 2.15; P = .001). The haplotype reconstruction analysis for the ACE gene showed that the D/-240T haplotype significantly and independently influenced the predisposition to PAD (P = .02). In 190 PAD patients with no additional atherosclerotic localizations (isolated PAD), a significant association between ACE D and -240T alleles and PAD was observed. Only the ACE D allele remained associated with isolated PAD after Bonferroni correction (P = .02) and after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (P = .02). The haplotype reconstruction analysis for the ACE gene showed that the D/-240T, but not the D/-240A haplotype significantly influenced the predisposition to PAD (P = .0003). No influence of the polymorphisms analyzed on the severity of the disease, according to Rutherford categories, was found.\nThe present study contributes data to highlight the role of the ACED/-240T haplotype in predisposing to PAD, also in the absence of other atherosclerotic comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Direct comparison of transposed arteriovenous fistulas (tAVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) has been hampered by inherent differences in patient characteristics between tAVF and AVG groups. In this study, using matching to control patient variables, we evaluated our outcomes with upper arm tAVF and upper arm prosthetic AVG.\nA retrospective review of all newly created upper arm tAVF and AVG was performed. One hundred ninety upper arm tAVF were group matched for age, gender, race, diabetes, and history of previous failed access with 168 AVG chosen from a pool of 476 concurrently performed AVG procedures. Complication, patency, and intervention rates were compared using multivariate analysis.\nMean follow up for our cohort was 29.1 months. Transposed fistulae consisted of 119 basilic vein and 71 cephalic vein transpositions, which were found to have similar demographic parameters, complication rates, and patency rates. There were no differences in 30 day mortality, 24 hour thrombosis, bleeding requiring exploration, or ischemic steal requiring intervention between the tAVF and AVG groups. More AVG developed infection requiring operative exploration than tAVF (7.9% vs 1.6%, respectively. P = .004). Primary patency for tAVF was higher than for AVG: 48% vs 14% at five years (P < .0001). Secondary patency rate for tAVF was also higher than for AVG: 57% vs 19% at five years (P < .0001). Nine percent of tAVF compared with 53% of AVG required one or more surgical and/or percutaneous revisions to maintain secondary patency (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that utilization of a tAVF was associated with a reduced risk of primary (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.35-0.64, P < .0001) and secondary failure (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.81, P = .0001).\nTransposed arteriovenous fistulas have significantly higher primary and secondary patency rates, require fewer revisions, and are less likely to develop a significant infection than AVG. This study supports the contention that as long as a patient is a candidate for a tAVF based on anatomic criteria, a tAVF should be considered before an AVG.",

    "abstract": "Successful repair of the ruptured (non-traumatic) descending thoracic aorta (rTA) remains a formidable clinical challenge. Although effective for rTA, traditional open repair (DTAR) has significant associated morbidity. With expanding indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), we describe our experience with TEVAR and DTAR in this high-risk setting to elucidate their evolving roles.\nSince the inception of our thoracic aortic endovascular program in 1993, 69 patients underwent DTAR (34) or TEVAR (35) for rTA. Patients underwent TEVAR if they were considered nonoperative candidates because of extensive comorbidities (n = 31; 88.6%) or had extremely favorable anatomy for endovascular repair (eg, mid-descending saccular aneurysm, n = 4). Aortic pathology causing rupture was fusiform aneurysm (18), saccular aneurysm/ulcer (22), and dissection (29). Associated aortobronchial fistulae (12) and aortoesophageal (1) fistulae were also present in 18.8%. Arch repair was needed in 46; total descending repair was needed in 33. Follow-up was 100% complete (mean 37.4 months).\nMean age was 65.9 years (DTAR 60.3 year vs TEVAR 71.3 years, P = .005). In-hospital or 30-day mortality was seen in 13 patients (TEVAR n = 4; 11.4% vs DTAR n = 9; 26.5%, P = .13). Median length of stay was shorter after TEVAR (8 days vs DTAR 15 days, P = .02). Mean Kaplan-Meier survival was similar between groups (TEVAR 67.4 months vs DTAR 65.0 months, P = .7). By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of a composite outcome of early mortality, stroke, permanent spinal cord ischemia, or need for dialysis or tracheostomy included the presentation with hemodynamic instability (P < .001) and treatment with conventional open repair (P = .02).\nAn endovascular approach for the ruptured (non-traumatic) descending thoracic aorta reduces early morbidity, mortality, and duration of hospitalization, while providing equivalent late outcomes even in an older group largely considered high risk for open repair. These data support a paradigm shift, with TEVAR emerging as the preferred therapy for all patients presenting with descending aortic rupture.",

All patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database containing pre-, intra-, and postoperative parameters. Patients were female in 1200 cases (1020 patients; Group 1) and male in the remaining 2809 (2304 patients, Group 2). Early results in terms of intraoperative neurological events and 30-day stroke and death rates were analyzed and compared. Follow-up results were analyzed with Kaplan Meier curves and compared with log-rank test.\nPatients of Group 1 were more likely to have hyperlipemia, diabetes, and hypertension; patients of Group 2 were more likely to be smokers and to have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). There were no differences in terms of clinical status or degree of stenosis. Patients of Group 2 had a significantly higher percentage of contralateral carotid artery occlusion than patients in Group 1 (6.9% and 3.9%, respectively; P < .001). Thirty-day stroke and death rates were similar in the two groups (1.2% for both groups). Univariate analysis demonstrated the presence of CAD, PAD, diabetes, and contralateral carotid artery occlusion to significantly affect 30-day stroke and death rate in female patients. At multivariate analysis, only diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.9; P = .05) and contralateral occlusion (OR 7.4, 95% CI 0.03-0.6; P = .006) were independently associated with an increased perioperative risk of stroke and death. Median duration of follow-up was 27 months (range, 1-144 months). There were no overall differences between the two groups in terms of survival, freedom from ipsilateral stroke, freedom from any neurological symptom, and incidence of severe (>70%) restenosis. In contrast to male patients, univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that female patients with diabetes or contralateral occlusion had an increased risk of developing ipsilateral neurological events during follow-up.\nFemale sex per se does not represent an adjunctive risk factor during CEA, with early and long term results comparable to those obtained in male patients. However, in our study we found subgroups of female patients at higher surgical risk, requiring careful intra- and postoperative management.",

We report the case of a 67-year-old man with an asymptomatic, large infrarenal AAA with an associated left common iliac artery aneurysm. Endovascular therapy for an aortoiliac aneurysm involved prior coil embolization of his left internal iliac artery to allow conventional EVAR with extension to the external iliac artery of the left graft limb, thus excluding the left iliac aneurysm. He presented 6 weeks postoperatively with onset of left-sided scrotal pain and underwent emergency orchidectomy for ischemic infarction of his left testis.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is exceedingly rare. Treatment options range from observation to anticoagulation to open surgery or endovascular repair. We present our experience to date in the management of isolated SMA dissections.\nA retrospective review of the vascular surgery and radiology databases from 1998 to 2008 was performed. In general, incidental radiologic findings of a dissection were managed expectantly. The decision to intervene was based on anatomic suitability, patient comorbidities and symptoms, and physician preference. Endovascular stents were placed using a brachial approach, with the choice of stent determined by physician preference. Patients who underwent endovascular stent placement (ESP) were maintained on antiplatelet therapy for 6 months postoperatively. Follow-up consisted of yearly office visits and adjunctive computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when clinically indicated.\nCT or MRI imaging identified nine patients (7 men, 2 women) with an isolated SMA dissection. One patient also had a concomitant celiac artery dissection. Median age was 70 years (range, 46-73 years). Median follow-up time was 32 months (range, 13.8-62.5 months). Presentations included an incidental radiologic finding in three patients and acute onset abdominal pain in six. Treatment included expectant management in four patients, anticoagulation in two, and ESP in three. ESP was performed primarily in two patients and in a third patient after initial management with anticoagulation failed. The reduction in the diameter of the true lumen was significantly greater in patients treated with ESP vs patients who were successfully managed expectantly or with anticoagulation (F = 15.59, P < .005). No procedural complications were associated with ESP.\nAn isolated SMA dissection is a rare entity that may be managed successfully in a variety of ways based on clinical presentation. Endovascular stenting can be performed with good results and may be the preferred treatment in patients with symptomatic isolated SMA dissections.",

    "abstract": "Inadequate iliac artery diameter, calcification, and tortuosity are associated with increased incidence of iliac injury during abdominal (EVAR) and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR). Despite careful preoperative assessment and use of iliac conduits, inadvertent iliac rupture is a source of morbidity and mortality. This report details our single-center, 10-year experience with intraoperative iliac artery rupture and describes a successful endovascular salvage technique.\nAll patients undergoing EVAR and TEVAR between August 1997 and June 2008 were reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) measurements of access vessels were obtained for all patients. The smallest diameter of the external or common iliac artery was used to determine suitability for access based on the instructions for use for each device. Patients who underwent repair of a procedure-related iliac artery rupture were identified. Outcomes among patients who did not have an access vessel rupture (nonruptured group) and those who did (ruptured group) were compared. Patency of the endovascular iliac repair is reported.\nDuring the study period, 369 EVARs and 67 TEVARs were performed. Eleven iliac conduits were used, all during TEVAR (16%). There were 18 ruptured iliac arteries in 17 patients; 11 EVAR patients (2.98%) sustained iliac rupture vs six TEVAR patients (8.9%). One EVAR patient was converted to open repair. Seventeen ruptures in 16 patients were successfully treated with endovascular stent graft placement. Iliac rupture was more likely to occur during TEVAR (8.9%) than EVAR (2.98%; P = .0239, Fisher exact test). Significantly more women were in the ruptured group (76% vs 19%; P < .0001, Fisher exact test). Patients in the ruptured group had longer lengths of stay (7.6 vs 5.1 days; P = .0895, t test), no 30-day mortality, but a procedure-related mortality of 11.8%. In the nonrupture group, 30-day mortality was 6.6% (4 of 61) and 2.8% (10 of 358) for TEVAR and EVAR, respectively, and procedure-related mortality was 9.8% (6 of 61) and 3.1% (11 of 358). For endovascular repair of iliac rupture, primary and primary-assisted patency was 88.2% and 94.1%, respectively, with median follow-up of 40 months (range 10-115 months).\nIliac rupture during EVAR or TEVAR can be successfully managed with endovascular stent grafting. Higher mortality and length of stay associated with iliac artery rupture confirm that there is no substitute for prevention. Access vessels of all patients undergoing EVAR should be examined closely for suitability. The threshold for using an iliac conduit, especially in women undergoing TEVAR, should be low.",

    "abstract": "Prior neck irradiation may induce atherosclerosis in the carotid artery and is considered an indication for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study sought to evaluate the effect of neck radiation therapy (XRT) on the rate of restenosis and embolic potential in patients undergoing CAS.\nTwo hundred ten CAS procedures were performed on 193 patients (XRT [N = 28], non-XRT [N = 182]). Mean follow-up was 347 +/- 339 days (median, 305 days; range, 16-1354 days). Duplex velocity criteria for restenosis after CAS were: >50% restenosis (peak systolic velocity [PSV] > 125 cm/sec, end diastolic velocity [EDV] 40-99 cm/sec, and internal carotid artery to common carotid artery systolic ratio [ICA/CCA] > 2.0); >70% restenosis (PSV>230 cm/sec, EDV>100 cm/sec, and ICA/CCA ratio >4.0). Restenosis >70% was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. Additional endpoints included groin hematoma, groin pseudoaneurysm, myocardial infarction, stroke, mortality, and the combined myocardial infarction/stroke/mortality rate. Captured particulate data was obtained from microporous filters used during CAS. Nineteen XRT and 128 non-XRT consecutive filters were analyzed. Photomicroscopy was performed along three axes for each filter, and the quantity and size of the captured particles were analyzed using video image analysis software.\nThere were more men (XRT: 85.7% vs. non-XRT: 52.8%, P < .001) and prior surgical neck dissections in the XRT patients (XRT: 82.1% vs. non-XRT: 4.7%, P < .001). Pre-procedural stenosis did not differ significantly betweeen the two groups (XRT: 86.5% +/- 8.9% [range, 70%-99%] vs. non-XRT: 85.5% +/- 8.7% [range 70%-99%], P = NS). Perioperative outcomes, including the composite 30 day stroke/myocardial infarction/mortality rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (XRT: 0% vs. non-XRT: 3.2%, P = NS). Twelve-month freedom from restenosis rates did not differ significantly at the 50% threshold (XRT: 95.5% vs. non-XRT: 90.3%, P = NS) or at the 70% threshold (XRT: 95.5% vs. non-XRT: 96.5%, P = NS). Target lesion revascularization did not differ significantly (XRT: 0% vs. non-XRT: 0.5%, P = NS). Photomicroscopy demonstrated a trend towards increased particle number and size in the XRT filters, however the results did not achieve statistical significance: particle number (XRT: 9.8 +/- 8.4 vs. non-XRT: 9.6 +/- 11.7, P = NS), %patients with particle size >1000 microm (XRT: 47.4% vs. non-XRT: 30.5%, P = NS).\nThis study suggests that the durability of CAS and the characteristics of captured embolic particles are not altered by a history of neck XRT. This supports the safety and efficacy of CAS for the treatment of patients with a history of neck XRT. Prior neck XRT may predispose the patient to the de novo development of stenoses at locations that were not previously treated.",

    "abstract": "A 79-year-old man with a 6-cm juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was treated by endovascular means with a fenestrated stent graft. The completion angiogram revealed a left renal artery occlusion. A retroperitoneal surgical approach allowed for retrograde catheterization of the occluded covered stent through the left renal artery. The covered stent was reopened by balloon angioplasty. After 2 months, the left renal artery was patent and renal function normal. At 6 months, both renal arteries were fully open on duplex imaging. The open retroperitoneal approach with retrograde catheterization is a bailout technique to avoid loss of a kidney in fenestrated stent grafting.",

    "abstract": "Atherothrombosis, characterized by atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent occlusive or subocclusive thrombus formation is the primary cause of acute ischemic syndromes involving all vascular beds and accounts for more than one-third of all deaths in the developed world. Platelet activation and aggregation constitute the most critical component in the pathophysiology of atherothrombotic disease. Aspirin is currently the most commonly used antiplatelet agent and one of the most frequently prescribed drugs, with as many as 30 million Americans on chronic aspirin regimens. Multiple well-designed prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated aspirin's efficacy in both primary and secondary prevention of a wide variety of entities that the atherothrombotic disease spectrum encompasses, such as cerebrovascular, coronary artery, and peripheral vascular disease. Despite its proven benefit, however, a growing body of evidence suggests that up to 70% of aspirin-takers may still be at risk for atherothrombotic complications due to resistance. Patients with laboratory-confirmed aspirin resistance seem to have an almost fourfold increase in their risk for acute thrombotic episodes, which underlines the magnitude of the problem for the vascular specialist. In this article, we review the physiology of platelet activation and the role of aspirin as an antiplatelet agent; the various laboratory assays used in assessing aspirin effectiveness; and current data on aspirin resistance and its clinical implications in patients with cardiovascular disease. We also review the studies that explore this phenomenon in patients with peripheral arterial disease and discuss the optimal management options in aspirin-resistant individuals. Suggestions are advanced for the direction of future trials evaluating aspirin resistance in patients with vascular disease.",
