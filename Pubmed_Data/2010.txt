In systematic reviews, the pooled mortality rate from rAIA after EVAR is around 20% and morbidity around 40%. The proportion of patients with rAIA treated by EVAR is steadily increasing, as most centers are adopting an EVAR as a first line therapy. However, two trials, one randomized (n = 32) and one nonrandomized, failed to demonstrate any benefit of EVAR to OR. The multicentric randomized study named ECAR (for Endosvasculaire vs Chirurgie dans les An\u00e9vrysmes Rompus) was setup on 160 patients to compare the EVAR vs OR in rAIA. The primary outcome is mortality at 1 month. The study started in January 2008 and is still in progress.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) continues to be a significantly morbid disease process for the aging population. Rigid guidelines for the management of patients with CLI are inappropriate due to the complexities that are involved in optimally treating these patients. A thin line exists in the decision process between medical management vs surgical management by revascularization or amputation, and the perception of \"success\" in this patient population is evolving. This review explores these issues and examines the challenges the treating physician will face when managing the care of patients with CLI. The epidemiology and natural history of CLI is discussed, along with the pathophysiology of the disease process. A review of the literature in regards to the different treatment modalities is presented to help the physician optimize therapy for patients with CLI. New scoring systems to help predict outcomes in patients with CLI undergoing revascularization or amputation are discussed, and an overview of the current status of patient-oriented outcomes is provided. Finally, we briefly examine emerging therapies for the treatment of CLI and provide an algorithm to help guide the practicing physician on how to approach the critically ischemic limb with regard to the complicated issues surrounding these patients.",

    "abstract": "A strategy in minimizing thrombotic events of vascular constructs is to seed the luminal surface with autologous endothelial cells (ECs). The task of seeding ECs can be achieved via bioreactors, which induce mechanical forces (shear stress, strain, pressure) onto the ECs. Although bioreactors can achieve a confluent layer of ECs in vitro, their acute response to blood remains unclear. Moreover, the necessary mechanical conditions that will increase EC adhesion and function remain unclear. We hypothesize that preconditioning seeded endothelium under physiological flow will enhance their retention and function.\nTo determine the role of varying preconditioning protocols on seeded ECs in vitro and in vivo.\nScaffolds derived from decelluarized arteries seeded with autologous ECs were preconditioned for 9 days. Three specific protocols, low steady shear stress (SS), high SS, and cyclic SS were investigated. After preconditioning, the seeded grafts were exposed to 15 minutes of blood via an ex vivo arteriovenous shunt model or alternately an in vivo arteriovenous bypass graft model.\nThe shunt model demonstrated ECs remained intact for all conditions. In the arteriovenous bypass model, only the cyclic preconditioned grafts remained intact, maintained morphology, and resisted the attachment of circulating blood elements such as platelets, red blood cells, and leukocytes. Western blotting analysis demonstrated an increase in the protein expression of eNOS and prostaglandin I synthase for the cyclic high shear stress-conditioned cells relative to cells conditioned with high shear stress alone.\nCyclic preconditioning has been shown here to increase the ECs ability to resist blood flow-induced shear stress and the attachment of circulating blood elements, key attributes in minimizing thrombotic events. These studies may ultimately establish protocols for the formation of a more durable endothelial monolayer that may be useful in the context of small vessel arterial reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, distribution, and extent of varicosities and focal dilatations in the saphenous trunks, their association with the sites of reflux, and their correlation with CEAP classes.\nThis prospective study included patients belonging to different CEAP classes (2-6) and a control group of age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (group C). Color-flow duplex scan imaging was used to evaluate the entire venous system from groin to ankle for reflux and obstruction. Varicose segments and focal dilatations of the great and small saphenous veins (GSV and SSV) were recorded, and the diameters throughout the length of the saphenous trunks were measured. The presence of varicosities in the tributaries and accessory veins were documented.\nFrom the 739 consecutive patients, 239 were excluded due to superficial venous thrombosis (SVT), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), both SVT and DVT, previous interventions, or C3-C6 presentation with no chronic venous disease (CVD). The included 500 patients (681 limbs) were divided into two groups based on CEAP class: group A (C2 + C3) and group B (C4-6). Group A had significantly more women than group B and a younger mean age (48 vs 56 years). Overall, GSV reflux (86%) was more prevalent than SSV reflux (17%), P < .0001. Saphenous trunk diameters, saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) and saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) involvement were greater in group B, (P < .01). Group C had smaller saphenous diameters compared to group A in all locations (P < .05) but the malleoli. The prevalence of the saphenous varicose segments in both groups was small with the GSV in group B being the highest (4.3%) and the SSV in group A being the smallest (1.2%). Focal dilatations were significantly more prevalent than varicosities in the saphenous trunks (P < .0001). Varicosities of tributaries and accessory veins were more prevalent than those of saphenous trunks (P < .0001). The mean length of varicose segments in the saphenous trunks was short (3.8 cm, range, 2.1-6.4 for group A vs 4.1 cm, range, 2.3-8.3 for group B, P = .09).\nA novel definition for varicosities in the saphenous trunks was established. Using this definition, it was determined that focal dilatations are far more common than varicosities. Because both of these entities are more prevalent in the accessory saphenous veins and tributaries, and CEAP class correlates positively with the extent of reflux and saphenous trunk diameter, studies on earlier interventions are warranted to prevent CVD progression.",

    "conclusions": "A novel definition for varicosities in the saphenous trunks was established. Using this definition, it was determined that focal dilatations are far more common than varicosities. Because both of these entities are more prevalent in the accessory saphenous veins and tributaries, and CEAP class correlates positively with the extent of reflux and saphenous trunk diameter, studies on earlier interventions are warranted to prevent CVD progression.",

The included 500 patients (681 limbs) were divided into two groups based on CEAP class: group A (C2 + C3) and group B (C4-6). Group A had significantly more women than group B and a younger mean age (48 vs 56 years). Overall, GSV reflux (86%) was more prevalent than SSV reflux (17%), P < .0001. Saphenous trunk diameters, saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) and saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) involvement were greater in group B, (P < .01). Group C had smaller saphenous diameters compared to group A in all locations (P < .05) but the malleoli. The prevalence of the saphenous varicose segments in both groups was small with the GSV in group B being the highest (4.3%) and the SSV in group A being the smallest (1.2%). Focal dilatations were significantly more prevalent than varicosities in the saphenous trunks (P < .0001). Varicosities of tributaries and accessory veins were more prevalent than those of saphenous trunks (P < .0001). The mean length of varicose segments in the saphenous trunks was short (3.8 cm, range, 2.1-6.4 for group A vs 4.1 cm, range, 2.3-8.3 for group B, P = .09).",

    "abstract": "Renal insufficiency (RI) seems to be a source of complications after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, published studies do not use a common definition of RI. Our objective was to analyze the effects of RI on carotid surgery using three classifications of renal function.\nUsing a prospective database, we studied renal function and postoperative complications in patients operated on between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2008. Renal function was studied using the level of plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance calculated according to the Cockcroft formula, and to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. For each method, the patients were divided into three groups: normal renal function, moderate RI, and severe RI. The principal judgment criterion was the 30-day non-fatal stroke and death rate.\nThe analysis concerned 961 CEAs carried out in 901 patients. The 30-day non-fatal stroke and death rate was 2%. In the analysis of renal function using the level of creatinine, there was no statistical difference between the groups in the 30-day stroke and death rate (normal renal function: 1.8%, moderate: 2.7%, severe: 8.3%, P = .21). The analysis of renal function according to creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft formula showed that in the severe RI group, the stroke and death rate was higher than in the other two groups (normal renal function: 1.7%, moderate RI: 1.4%, severe RI: 7.5%, P = .004). Analysis using the MDRD formula showed similar differences between the severe RI group and the other two with a higher rate of 30-day stroke and death (normal renal function: 1.4%, moderate RI: 1.7%, severe RI: 12.5%, P < .001). Subgroup analysis showed that among patients with severe RI according to the creatinine clearance, those with symptomatic carotid stenosis had the highest incidences of non-fatal stroke and death (Cockcroft, n = 19: 21.1%, MDRD, n = 10: 40%).\nSevere RI is a risk factor for complications after carotid surgery. Creatinine clearance calculated according to the MDRD formula correlates most closely with these complications. Symptomatic patients with severe RI, according to the creatinine clearance, are at high risk with a very high level of postoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the significance of blood transfusion in patients with peripheral arterial disease. We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database to examine the effect of intraoperative blood transfusion on the morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization.\nWe analyzed data from the participant use data file containing vascular surgical cases submitted to the ACS NSQIP in 2005, 2006, and 2007 by 173 hospitals. Current procedural terminology codes were used to select lower extremity procedures that were grouped into venous graft, prosthetic graft, or thromboendarterectomy. Thirty-day outcomes analyzed were (1) mortality, (2) composite morbidity, (3) graft/prosthesis failure, (4) return to the operating room within 30 days, (5) wound occurrences, (6) sepsis or septic shock, (7) pulmonary occurrences, and (8) renal insufficiency or failure. Intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells was categorized as none, 1 to 2 units, and 3 or more units. Outcome rates were compared between the transfused and nontransfused groups using the chi(2) test and multivariable regression adjusting for transfusion propensity, comorbid and procedural risk.\nA total of 8799 patients underwent lower extremity revascularization between 2005 and 2007. Mean age was 66.8 +/- 12.0 years and 5569 (63.3%) were male. Transfusion rates ranged from 14.5% in thromboendarterectomy patients to 27.1% in prosthetic bypass patients (P < .05). After adjustment for transfusion propensity and patient and procedural risks, transfusion of 1 or 2 units remained significantly predictive of mortality, composite morbidity, sepsis/shock, pulmonary occurrences, and return to the operating room. The adjusted odds ratios for 30-day mortality ranged from 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.70) for 1 to 2 units to 2.48 (95% CI 1.55-3.98) for 3 or more units.\nIn a large number of patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, we have found that there is a higher risk of postoperative mortality, pulmonary, and infectious complications after receiving intraoperative blood transfusion. Additional studies are necessary to better define transfusion triggers that balance the risk/benefit ratio for blood transfusion.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the safety and effectiveness of a novel thrombolytic, alfimeprase, in catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) of acute peripheral arterial occlusions (PAO).\nBetween April 2005 and March 2007, patients with acute PAO (Rutherford class I or IIa) of a lower extremity and onset of symptoms within 14 days prior to randomization were included. Studies HA004 and HA007 enrolled respectively 300 and 102 patients. Both studies HA004 and HA007 were placebo-controlled. HA004 had two placebo arms, intrathrombus and perithrombus, while HA007 had intrathrombus placebo arm. HA004 was partially double-blind (perithrombus group was not blinded) and HA007 was double-blind. Patients were randomized to intrathrombus alfimeprase (0.3 mg/kg), intrathrombus (IT) placebo, or perithrombus (PT) placebo (HA004 only) in two divided weight-based infusions 2 hours apart. Depending on arteriographic results after treatment, patients received no further intervention or underwent endovascular therapy or open vascular surgery. The primary endpoint of both studies was efficacy of alfimeprase compared with placebo as measured by avoidance of an open vascular surgery procedure at 30 days.\nThe avoidance of open vascular surgery at 30 days was seen in 52 (34.9%), 42 (37.2%), and 7 patients (18.4%) with alfimeprase, IT placebo, and PT placebo in HA004 and 15 (29.4%) and 9 patients (17.6%) with alfimeprase and IT placebo in HA007; differences between alfimeprase and IT placebo were not statistically significant. Results were similar for secondary endpoints, including arterial flow restoration in 4 hours, 30-day ankle-brachial index, index limb pain severity, and hospital stay duration. The overall rate of adverse events was higher with alfimeprase than placebo. Hemorrhagic and peripheral embolic event rates with alfimeprase were 23% (34 patients) and 10.1% (15 patients) in HA004 and 9.4% (5 patients) and 9.8% (5 patients) in HA007; rates with IT placebo were 11% (12 patients, P = .107) and 5% (5 patients, P = .148) in HA004 and 10% (5 patients, P = .982) and 0% in HA007 (P = .07). No deaths were related to study drug administration.\nCDT for acute PAO with alfimeprase was as safe as placebo. However, alfimeprase was no more effective than placebo in increasing 30-day surgery-free survival. The surprising effectiveness of placebo alone demonstrates that the inclusion of a placebo arm is essential to the design of future lytic trials.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the outcome of ruptured juxtarenal aortic aneurysm (RJAA) repair. Surgical treatment of RJAAs requires suprarenal aortic cross-clamping, which causes additional renal ischemia-reperfusion injury on top of the pre-existing hypovolemic shock syndrome. As endovascular alternatives rarely exist in this situation, open repair continues to be the gold standard. We analyzed our results of open RJAA repair during an 11-year period.\nRetrospective observational study.\nBetween July 1997 and December 2008, all consecutive patients with RJAAs were included in the study. Part of these patients received cold perfusion of the kidneys during suprarenal aortic cross-clamping. Perioperative variables, morbidity, and 30-day or in-hospital mortality were assessed. Renal insufficiency was defined as an acute rise of >or=0.5 mg/dL in serum creatinine level. Multiple organ failure (MOF) was scored using the sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score).\nA total of 29 consecutive patients with an RJAA, confirmed by computed tomography-scanning, presented to our hospital. In eight patients, the operation was aborted before the start of aortic repair, because no blood pressure could be regained in spite of maximal resuscitation measures. They were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 21 patients, 10 died during hospital stay. Renal insufficiency occurred in 11 out of 21 of the patients. Eleven out of 21 patients developed MOF postoperatively. In a subgroup of patients who received renal cooling during suprarenal aortic clamping, the 30-day or in-hospital mortality was two of 10 vs eight of 11 in patients who did not receive renal cooling (P = .03); renal insufficiency occurred in one out of 10 patients in the subgroup with renal cooling vs 10 out of 11 without renal cooling (P < .001) and MOF in two of 10 vs nine of 11, respectively (P = .009).\nOpen surgical repair of RJAAs is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cold perfusion of the kidneys during RJAA repair. Although numbers are small, a beneficial effect of renal cooling on the outcome of RJAA repair is suggested, warranting further research with this technique.",

    "abstract": "Takayasu arteritis (TA) is an immune-mediated disease with an unknown etiology. Assessment of disease activity in patients with TA is challenging owing to the absence of reliable serologic markers. Because circulation levels of acute-phase proteins fluctuate with the severity and extent of the inflammatory reaction, they may be potential biomarkers for the identification of TA activity. To test this hypothesis, certain acute-phase proteins were examined in TA patients and controls.\nThe study included 43 prospectively selected TA patients, with 18 in active phase and 25 in inactive phase. The Sharma modified criteria were used for disease diagnosis, and the National Institutes of Health criteria were used for TA activity assessment. Circulation levels of acute-phase proteins, including serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen, complement C4-binding protein (C4BP), C-reactive protein, serum amyloid P, haptoglobin, alpha-acid glycoprotein, transthyretin, alpha1-microglobin, and complement fraction C3c and C4a were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in each participant.\nCirculating levels of SAA and C4BP were significantly increased in active TA patients compared with inactive TA patients and in controls, with (SAA: 95.9 [interquartile range, 51.9] vs 49.2 [82.0], P = .009; and 23.9 [50.1] mg/L, P = .001, respectively; C4BP: 88.5 [72.6] vs 61.7 [57.7], P = .023; and 32.6 [32.1] mg/L, P < .001, respectively). The levels of both proteins in inactive TA patients were still higher than those in controls (SAA: 49.2 [82.0] vs 23.9 [50.1] mg/L, P = .021; C4BP: 61.7 [57.7] vs 32.6 [32.1] mg/L, P = .025). No difference was found in the levels of the other acute-phase proteins studied.\nSAA and C4BP may be useful biomarkers in determining the disease activity of TA. More work should be done to test these results in a large cohort of patients in a longitudinal manner.",

    "abstract": "Patients with pancreatic tumors may have portal vein (PV) and/or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) invasion. In such cases, lower extremity veins can provide an autogenous conduit for PV/SMV reconstruction. Little data exist, however, describing the technique of PV/SMV reconstruction, patency of such reconstructions, and the morbidity of using lower extremity veins for PV/SMV reconstruction during pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nThirty-four patients underwent PV/SMV reconstruction during pancreaticoduodenectomy using lower extremity vein. The saphenous vein was preferred for patching and femoral vein for replacement. We analyzed preoperative imaging, reconstruction patency, vein harvest morbidity, and late mortality.\nThe mean age was 62.6 years. All 34 patients had preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging and/or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) scan. Fourteen of the 34 patients had evidence of PV/SMV invasion on CT or EUS scans, 14 did not, and six studies were indeterminate. Twenty-five patients had follow-up imaging, and 22 (88%) had patent reconstructions. Fifteen patients had PV/SMV replacement using femoral vein. Seven of these 15 had minor postoperative lower extremity edema that resolved over time, five had wound complications from the femoral vein harvest site, three of which required minor operative procedures for treatment. Fifteen patients had PV/SMV patching with the great saphenous vein, none had postoperative wound problems, and one had minimal postoperative lower extremity edema. Four patients had PV/SMV patching using femoral vein, none had postoperative wound problems, and one had minimal postoperative lower extremity edema. Compared with patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy without PV/SMV reconstruction, by Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no difference in late mortality.\nPreoperative imaging may fail to detect PV/SMV involvement in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The PV/SMV reconstruction with leg vein provides good patency with minimal postoperative lower extremity complications and no increase in late mortality. The lower extremities should be routinely included in the operative field of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.",

    "abstract": "Since the publication of Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines, the use of native veins for the construction of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) for hemodialysis has been highly recommended rather than prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVG). Upper arm basilic vein transposition (BVT) has been accepted widely, with superior patency compared with AVG, but only a few studies have reported outcomes of forearm BVT (FBVT). This study evaluated the efficacy of FBVT compared with direct AVF (DAVF) and AVG in a tertiary referral center.\nFrom January 2005 to December 2007, 461 patients underwent AV access for hemodialysis in Seoul National University Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and dialysis sheets and evaluated the current AVF function in the outpatient clinic or by telephone interviews. Patients were grouped by the operation type: DAVF, FBVT, and AVG. The outcomes compared were primary, assisted-primary and secondary patency rates, maturation failure, and complications.\nThe mean age was 59 years (range, 14-92 years), and 280 patients (60.7%) were male. By operation type, the 461 accesses were 389 DAVF (84.4%), 34 FBVT (7.4%), and 38 AVG (8.2%). Mean follow-up duration was 21 months (range, 1-51 months). The primary patency rates for DAVF, FBVT, and AVG were 67.6%, 41.5%, 35% at 12 months and 53.9%, 30.2%, 10.3% at 24 months, respectively. The secondary patency rates were 89.2%, 79.1%, 78.3% at 12 months and 83.8%, 74.4%, 64.9% at 24 months, respectively. Maturation failure occurred in five DAVF patients and in one FBVT patient. The infection rate was 0.3% in DAVF and 12.5% in AVG, but no infection occurred in patients with FBVT. Multivariate analysis revealed that age and history of previous access were associated with lower primary patency.\nForearm BVT showed an acceptable, high 2-year patency rate and fewer thromboses and infectious complications than AVG. Forearm BVT could be considered before forming an upper arm AVF or forearm AVG, if the basilic vein is available.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies have documented racial and ethnic disparities in rates of amputations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the United States. We analyze whether there are underlying differences in the types of treatment provided to patients who are acutely hospitalized for PAD.\nThe 1998-2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to examine patterns of treatment. We considered a hospitalization an acute admission for PAD if (1) the primary diagnosis was PAD, and (2) the patient was admitted urgently or emergently or through an emergency department. Vascular interventions were designated as open bypass, endovascular intervention, or major amputation, defined as disarticulation at the ankle or higher amputation.\nFrom 1998 through 2006, the likelihood of an endovascular procedure being performed during an acute hospitalization for PAD increased from 11.5% to 35.3%, and open vascular procedures decreased from 34.9% to 25.4%. The likelihood of a major amputation during an acute hospitalization for PAD decreased from 29.7% to 20.3%. Black and Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to undergo amputation and were less likely to have an endovascular or open revascularization.\nUse of endovascular procedures has increased and use of open vascular bypass has decreased in the inpatient treatment of acute PAD. Although the overall likelihood of amputation has decreased, racial and ethnic differences persist, with black and Hispanic patients experiencing a higher likelihood of amputation.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated gender-specific trends in the diagnosis and treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) in the United States Medicare population.\nThe Medicare beneficiary database (1995 through 2006) was examined for patients with rAAAs using International Classification of Diseaes, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Codes for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) were only available for the year 2000 forward, and thus, analysis of EVAR was limited to 2000 through 2006. Proportions were analyzed by chi(2) and continuous variables by t-test. Factors associated with 30-day mortality and discharge home after surgery were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. The effect of gender and repair type (open or EVAR) on death and the probability of discharge to home after repair were also evaluated.\nThe rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for men decreased by 52% (from 40 to 19) and by 36% for women (from 11 to 7). The observed 30-day mortality rate was overall 7.7% higher for women vs men. The mortality rate for women was higher by 8.9% for open repair and higher by 7.1% for EVAR vs men. Female gender was associated with increased risk of death in multivariate analysis after controlling for age, year, and type of procedure. Women were 9.8% less likely to be discharged to home after rAAA repair, regardless of the type of repair.\nIn addition to the fact that we have failed to realize a change in the number of women diagnosed with or treated for rAAA, a significant gender difference remains in the outcomes after treatment for rAAA. This differential is present in both the 30-day mortality rate and in the potential to be discharged to home after repair.",

    "abstract": "Angiography remains a critical component for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic intervention in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The goal of this study was to compare angiography with corresponding intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging of the same vessels in patients with PAD.\nFrom 2004 to 2008, 93 patients undergoing angiography for PAD were recruited in a prospective observational analysis. At the time of angiography, diseased lower extremities were interrogated using a 10-cm IVUS pullback with registration points. IVUS data were analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for vessel and lumen diameter, plaque volume, plaque composition, and cross-sectional area. Similarly, three vascular surgeons blinded to the IVUS data graded corresponding angiographic images according to vessel diameter, degree of stenosis, degree of calcification, and extent of eccentricity. Statistical analyses of matched IVUS images and angiograms were performed.\nThe distribution of demographic and risk variables were typical for PAD: 54% male, 96% hypertension, 78% hyperlipidemia, 44% diabetic, 87% tobacco history, 65% coronary artery disease, and 10% end-stage renal disease. Symptoms precipitating the angiographic evaluation included claudication (53%), rest pain (18%), and tissue loss (29%). Angiographic and IVUS interpretation were similar for luminal diameters, but external vessel diameter was greater by IVUS imaging (7.0 +/- 0.7 vs 5.2 +/- 0.8 mm, P < .05). The two-dimensional diameter method resulted in a significant correlation for stenosis determination (r = 0.84); however, IVUS determination of vessel area stenosis was greater by 10% (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-21%, P < .05). IVUS imaging indicated that a higher proportion of plaques were concentric. Grading of calcification was moderate to severe in 40% by angiography but in only 7% by IVUS (P < .05).\nIn the evaluation of PAD, angiography and IVUS imaging provide similar luminal diameters and diameter-reducing stenosis measurements. Determination of overall vessel diameter and interpretation of plaque morphology by angiography are discordant from IVUS-derived data.",

    "abstract": "High serum levels of estradiol are associated with clinical evidence of varicose veins in women; however, the relationship between serum sex steroid hormones and varicose veins in men is unclear. To address this issue, serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, and androstenedione were determined in the great saphenous (GSV) and cubital veins of men with varicose veins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of sex steroid hormones, metabolizing enzymes, and their receptors was investigated in tissue samples of leg veins.\nThis prospective study included 40 men, comprising 20 with varicose veins and reflux of the GSV (VM) and 20 with healthy veins (HM). All limbs were assessed by duplex ultrasound scanning of selected superficial and deep leg veins. Blood samples were taken from the cubital vein and from the GSV. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for sex steroid hormones, their metabolizing enzymes, and receptors in saphenous veins was performed in tissue samples of varicose (n = 6) and healthy veins (n = 6).\nThe VM group had significantly higher (P < .001) mean levels for serum testosterone (44.9 nmol/L; range, 8.8-225.1) and estradiol (242.2 pmol/L; range, 79-941) in varicose saphenous veins compared with cubital veins (testosterone, 15.5 nmol/L; range, 8.4-23.3; estradiol, 93.2 pmol/L; range, 31-147). Moreover, significantly (P < .001) higher mean serum estradiol levels (133.2 pmol/L; range, 63-239) were detected in the saphenous veins of the HM group compared with cubital veins (88.15 pmol/L; range, 37-153). Both groups had similar blood counts and serum androstenedione levels in the upper and lower extremity. Interestingly, qRT-PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of 5alpha-reductase type 1, 5alpha-reductase type 2, 17, 20 lyase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD), aromatase and 3beta-HSD type 2, androgen and estrogen receptor 1 was down-regulated (P < .05) in all samples of varicose veins vs veins obtained from healthy men.\nElevated serum estradiol and testosterone levels were detected in men with varicose veins and reflux in the GSV compared with the patient's own arm veins. Enzymes and hormonal receptors involved in steroid metabolism were down-regulated in patients with GSV reflux and varicose veins, suggestive of a negative feedback regulation. These data support the notion of a possible causal relationship between sex steroids and varicose veins in men.",

    "abstract": "Two large randomized trials showed that elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) had similar all-cause long-term mortality rates but increased costs compared with open repair for nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Despite these data, the use of EVAR continues to increase in North America. Currently, there are very limited adjusted population-based data examining long-term outcomes and resource utilization.\nAll patients who underwent elective AAA repair between April 2002 and March 2007 in Ontario were identified using data from hospital discharge abstracts. Patients were identified with a validated algorithm. A propensity score analysis was used to adjust for treatment allocation. Clinical outcomes included time to all-cause death and discharge to a nursing home or long-term care facility. Resource utilization outcomes included imaging utilization, hospital utilization, and reintervention rates.\nOverall, 6461 patients underwent treatment of nonruptured AAAs, comprising 888 EVARs and 5573 open repairs. EVAR patients were older and had more comorbidities. The adjusted mortality was significantly lower in the EVAR group at 30 days (adjusted odds ratio [adj-OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.20-0.59), but long-term mortality was similar (adj-OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.05). EVAR patients were significantly less likely to be discharged to a nursing home or other chronic care facility (adj-OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.41-0.74). Imaging utilization as well as urgent and vascular readmissions were significantly higher in the EVAR group. However, the EVAR group had a significantly shorter length of stay and less intensive care unit use for the index hospitalization and decreased hospital length of stay during follow-up. There was a trend toward a slightly increased risk of reintervention with EVAR (adj-OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.98-1.75).\nCompared with open repair, EVAR significantly reduced short-term but not long-term mortality. The EVAR patients spent less time in health institutions, including long-term care facilities, but underwent more imaging studies. Future improvements in EVAR could result in further decreases in reinterventions and subsequent radiologic monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to report our experience in the repair of renal artery aneurysms using robot-assisted surgery.\nBetween December 2002 and March 2009, five women with a mean age of 63.8 years (range, 57-78 years) underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic repair of renal artery aneurysms by the same surgeon at two different institutions, the Department of General Surgery, Misericordia Hospital, Grosseto, Italy (three patients) and the Division of Minimally Invasive and Robotic Surgery at the University of Illinois, Chicago (two patients). The mean size of the lesions was 19.4 mm (range, 9-28 mm). Four of the lesions were complex aneurysms involving the renal artery bifurcation. Two patients were symptomatic and three had hypertension. In situ repair by aneurysmectomy was performed in all cases, followed by revascularization. In complex aneurysms, an autologous saphenous vein graft was used for the reconstruction.\nThe mean operative time was 288 minutes (range, 170-360 min) and the estimated surgical blood loss was 100 ml (range, 50-300 ml). Warm ischemia time was 10 minutes in the patient treated by aneurysmectomy, followed by direct reconstruction. The average warm ischemia time was 38.5 minutes (range, 20-60 min) for patients treated with saphenous vein graft interposition. The mean time to resume a regular diet was 1.6 days (range, 1-2 days). The mean postoperative length of hospital stay was 5.6 days (range, 3-7 days). No postoperative morbidity was noted. The mean follow-up time for the entire series was 28 months (range, 6-48 months). Color Doppler ultrasonography examination showed patency in all reconstructed vessels. One patient had stenosis of one of the reconstructed branches, which was treated with percutaneous angioplasty.\nRobot-assisted laparoscopic repair of renal artery aneurysms is feasible, safe and effective. The technical advantages of the robotic system allows for microvascular reconstruction to be performed using a minimally invasive approach, even in complex cases. This approach may also allow for improved postoperative recovery and reduce the morbidity correlated with open repair of renal artery aneurysms. Although more experience and technical refinements are necessary, robot-assisted laparoscopic repair of renal artery aneurysms represents a valid alternative to open surgery.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery training has evolved from a single clinical year after general surgery training to a multi-year training program to encompass such entities as noninvasive vascular laboratory, office-based procedures, and endovascular techniques. Simultaneously, members of the vascular surgery community have had to undergo significant training to become facile with endovascular techniques. We surveyed vascular surgery trainees on the online Vascular Surgery In-Training Examination (VSITE) in 2008 and 2009 to assess who trained them in percutaneous techniques.\nVascular surgery trainees in the Independent (2-year) and Integrated (5-year) training programs were asked to participate in a survey upon completion of the VSITE in 2008 and 2009. Examinees were asked to select whether vascular surgeons, cardiologists, or interventional radiologists trained them in carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS), thoracic endografts (TEVAR), endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), renal artery intervention, iliac stenting, superficial femoral artery (SFA), and tibial artery percutaneous interventions.\nSurvey response rate was 79.6% (191 of 240). Results of the survey are shown in Table I. In 2009, vascular surgeons provided more than 84% of the training to vascular surgery residents.

Data supporting thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to reduce mortality and morbidity for TTAI is limited to small series and meta-analyses. In this study, we evaluated the trends and outcomes of open surgery and TEVAR for TTAI in New York State.\nAll cases of TTAI in New York State between 2000 and 2007 were extracted from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database. A diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision coding of TTAI was required for inclusion.\nWe identified 328 patients with TTAI who underwent surgical repair in New York State between 2000 and 2007; mean age of the cohort was 39.3 years +/- 18 years; 80% were male. Open repair of TTAI was performed in 79.6% and 20.4% underwent TEVAR. Open repair was performed for all cases of TTAI until the introduction of TEVAR in 2005; TEVAR exceeded the use of open repair for TTAI in 2006 and 2007. Additional major injuries were present in 71.7% in the open repair group vs 91.0% of the TEVAR group (P = .001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate for the 8-year period was significantly increased after open repair of TTAI compared with TEVAR: 17% vs 6%, (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-9.23; P = .024). After controlling for the significant covariates, TEVAR independently reduced the risk of death following surgical intervention for TTAI compared with the open procedure (OR 3.8, 95% CI, 1.28-10.99; P = .010). Respiratory complications were the most common postoperative morbidity, and were significantly increased after open repair: 38% vs 24% (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.05-3.60; P = .032). There were no significant differences in cardiac complications, acute renal failure (ARF), paraplegia, or stroke. Endoleak and distal embolization each occurred in 9% of patients after TEVAR.\nThere has been a shift toward endovascular management of patients with TTAI. This change in surgical strategy has been associated with less postoperative mortality and fewer pulmonary complications in patients suffering from TTAI. TEVAR is associated with significant device-related complications.",

    "abstract": "Demographic and practice modality changes during the past decade have led to a substantial shift in the management of peripheral vascular disease. This study examined the effect of these changes using large national and regional data sets on procedure type, indications, morbidity, and on the primary target outcome: limb salvage.\nNational Inpatient Sample (NIS) data sets and New York (NY) State inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient surgeries discharge databases from 1998 through 2007 were used to identify hospitalizations for lower extremity revascularization (LER) and major amputations. Patients were selected by cross-referencing diagnostic and procedural codes. Proportions were analyzed by chi(2) analysis, continuous variables by t test, and trends by the Poisson regression.\nThe national per capita (100,000 population, age >40 years) volume of major amputations decreased by 38%. The volume for national and regional use of endovascular LER doubled. The volume of open LER decreased by 67% from 1998 through 2007. Ambulatory endovascular LER grew in NY State from 7 per capita in 1998 to 22 in 2007. Interventions declined by 20% (93 to 75) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) but increased by nearly 50% for claudication. Outpatient data analysis revealed a fivefold increase in vascular interventions for CLI and claudication. Nationally, endovascular LER interventions quadrupled (8% to 32%) for CLI and doubled (26% to 61%) for claudication. A parallel reduction occurred in major amputations for patients with CLI (42% to 30%), for other PAD diagnoses (18% to 14%), and for claudication (0.9% to 0.3%). Although surgical interventions for CLI declined significantly for octogenarians from 317 to 240, outpatient interventions increased for CLI, claudication, and other diagnoses in all age groups. Comorbidities for patients treated in 2006 were substantially greater than those of a decade ago. For most procedures, cardiac and bleeding complications have significantly decreased during the last decade. Length of stay (LOS) declined from 9.5 to 7.6 days and the percentage of short (1-2 day) hospitalizations increased from 16% to 35%.\nAlthough patients today, whether treated for claudication or CLI, have more comorbidities, the rates of amputation, the procedural morbidity and mortality, and LOS have all significantly decreased. Other variables, including changes in medical management and wound care, undoubtedly are important, but this change appears to be largely due to the widespread and successful use of endovascular LER or to earlier intervention, or both, driven by the safety of these techniques.",

    "abstract": "The association between carotid plaque calcification and clinical ischemic events is unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically review published studies comparing degree of calcification between clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques.\nA systematic search for relevant studies was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. For studies reporting a rating scale or a continuous measure of calcification, study-specific and pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques were calculated. For studies reporting a dichotomous measure, study-specific and pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. If no significant heterogeneity was present (I(2) <or=50%), a fixed-effects pooling model was used. If significant heterogeneity was present (I(2) >50%), a random-effects pooling model was used, and sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analyses.\nThe 24 studies included in this systematic review used a wide range of methodologies to quantify degree of calcification and a wide range of definitions to define clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques. Pooled fixed-effects SMD of calcification volume or weight between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques was -0.425 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.608 to -0.241); I(2) = 39.3%. Pooled random-effects SMD of calcification percentage was -0.997 (95% CI, -1.793 to -0.200); I(2) = 93.8. Subgroup analyses did not reveal homogeneous subgroups. Pooled fixed-effects OR for the association between high degree of plaque calcification and symptoms was 0.696 (95% CI, 0.528 to 0.918); I(2) = 21.1%.\nThe results of this systematic review suggest that clinically symptomatic plaques have a lower degree of calcification than asymptomatic plaques.

    "abstract": "Subclinical alterations of cerebral function can occur during or after carotid revascularization and can be detected by a variety of standard tests. This comparative study assessed the relationship among serum levels for two biochemical markers of cerebral injury, postoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), and neuropsychometric testing in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) for high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis.\nForty-three consecutive asymptomatic patients underwent carotid revascularization by endarterectomy (CEA, 20) or stenting (CAS, 23). They were evaluated with DW-MRI and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test preoperatively and <or=24 hours after carotid revascularization. Venous blood samples to assess serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100beta protein were collected for each patient preoperatively and five times in a 24-hour period postoperatively and assayed using automated commercial equipment. The MMSE test was repeated at 6 months. The relationship between serum marker levels and neuropsychometric and imaging tests and differences between the two groups of patients were analyzed by chi(2) test, with significance at P < .05.\nNo transient ischemic attacks or strokes were clinically observed. CAS caused more new subcortical lesions at postoperative DW-MRI and a significant decline in the MMSE postoperative score compared with CEA (P = .03). In CAS patients, new lesions at DW-MRI were significantly associated with a postoperative MMSE score decline >5 points (P = .001). Analysis of S100beta and NSE levels showed a significant increase at 24 hours in CAS patients compared with CEA patients (P = .02). The MMSE score at 6 months showed a nonsignificant increase vs the postoperative score in both groups.\nBiochemical markers measurements of brain damage combined with neuropsychometric tests and DW-MRI can be used to evaluate silent injuries after CAS. The mechanisms of rise in S100beta and NSE levels at 24 hours after CAS may be due to increased perioperative microembolization rather than to hypoperfusion. Further studies are required to assess the clinical significance of those tests in carotid revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair is an established modality of treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms. It is therefore reasonable to expect its application to other less common aneurysmal conditions, including isolated iliac and popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA). There are, however, essential differences between aortic aneurysms and peripheral aneurysms: smaller arterial caliber, mobility of the arterial segment, associated occlusive disease, and devices that have not been specifically designed for peripheral applications. Due to these differences, results obtained in abdominal aortic aneurysms cannot be extrapolated to peripheral aneurysms. The attraction of the endovascular repair for PAA is its minimally invasive nature. The literature, however, provides only case reports, case series and small cohorts, and one small randomized, controlled trial. A cumulative summary of these studies provides the clinician with information upon which to base the choice of treatment on a specific patient. Endovascular repair for PAA with suitable anatomy and good run-off can be considered safe, and medium term results appear comparable with those of open repair.",

    "abstract": "Venous leg ulcers (VLU) have a huge social and economic impact. An estimated 1.5% of European adults will suffer a venous ulcer at some point in their lives. Despite the widespread use of bandaging with high pressure in the treatment of this condition, recurrence rates range between 25% to 70%. Numerous studies have suggested that the compression system should provide sub-bandage pressure values in the range from 35 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg in order to achieve the best possible healing results.\nAn open, randomized, prospective, single-center study was performed in order to determine the healing rates of VLU when treated with different compression systems and different sub-bandage pressure values. One hundred thirty-one patients (72 women, 59 men; mean age, 59-years-old) with VLU (ulcer surface >3 cm(2); duration >3 months) were randomized into three groups: group A - 42 patients who were treated using an open-toed, elastic, class III compression device knitted in tubular form (Tubulcus, Laboratoires Innothera, Arcueil, France); group B - 46 patients treated with the multi-component bandaging system comprised of Tubulcus and one elastic bandage (15 cm wide and 5 cm long with 200% stretch, Niva, Novi Sad, Serbia); and group C - forty-three patients treated with the multi-component bandaging system comprised of Tubulcus and two elastic bandages. Pressure measurements were taken with the Kikuhime device (TT MediTrade, Soro, Denmark) at the B1 measuring point in the supine, sitting, and standing positions under the three different compression systems.\nThe median resting values in the supine and standing positions in examined study groups were as follows: group A - 36.2 mm Hg and 43.9 mm Hg; group B - 53.9 mm Hg and 68.2 mm Hg; group C - 74.0 mm Hg and 87.4 mm Hg. The healing rate during the 26-week treatment period was 25% (13/42) in group A, 67.4% (31/46) in group B, and 74.4% (32/43) in group C. The success of compression treatment in group A was strongly associated with the small ulcer surface (<5 cm(2)) and smaller calf circumference (CC; <38 cm). On the other hand, compliance in group A was good. In groups B and C, compliance was poor in patients with small CC, but the healing rate was high, especially in patients with large ulcers and a large CC (>43 cm).\nThe results obtained in this study indicate that better healing results are achieved with two or multi-component compression systems than with single-component compression systems and that a compression system should be individually determined for each patient according to individual characteristics of the leg and CC. Target sub-bandage pressure value (B1 measuring point in the sitting position) of the compression system needed for the ulcer healing could be determined according to a simple formula, CC + CC/2.",

    "abstract": "Varicose veins and other vascular abnormalities are common clinical entities. Treatment options include vein stripping, sclerotherapy, and endovenous laser treatment, but all involve some degree of invasive intervention. The purpose of this study was to determine ex vivo the effectiveness of a novel hand-held, battery-operated, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device for transcutaneous venous ablation.\nThe ultrasound device is 14 x 9 x 4 cm, weighs 650 g, and is powered by 4 lithium ion battery packs. An ex vivo testing platform consisting of two different models comprised of sequentially layered skin-muscle-vein or skin-fat-vein was developed, and specimens were treated with HIFU. The tissues were then disassembled, imaged, and processed for histology. The luminal cross-sectional area of vein that had been treated with HIFU and nontreated controls were measured, and the values presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The values were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and statistical significance was set at P < .05.\nOn gross and histologic examination, veins that had been treated with HIFU showed evidence of coagulation necrosis. The surface of the muscle in direct contact with the vein had a pinpoint area of coagulation, whereas the adjacent fat appeared undisturbed; the skin, fat, and the surface of the muscle in contact with the transducer remained completely unaffected. The cross-sectional area was 3.79 mm(2) (IQR, 3.38-4.22) of the control vein lumen and 0.16 mm(2) (IQR, 0.04-0.39) in those that had been treated with HIFU (P = .0304).\nThis inexpensive, portable HIFU device has the potential to allow clinicians to easily perform venous ablation in a manner that is entirely noninvasive and without the expense or inconvenience of large, complicated devices. This device represents a significant step forward in the development of new applications for HIFU technology.",

    "abstract": "Controversy persists regarding the use of protamine during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) based on prior conflicting reports documenting both reduced bleeding as well as increased stroke risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation on the outcome of CEA in a contemporary multistate registry.\nWe reviewed a prospective regional registry of 4587 CEAs in 4311 patients performed by 66 surgeons from 11 centers in Northern New England from 2003-2008. Protamine use varied by surgeon (38% routine use, 44% rare use, 18% selective use). Endpoints were postoperative bleeding requiring reoperation as well as potential thrombotic complications, including stroke, death, and myocardial infarction (MI). Predictors of endpoints were determined by multivariate logistic regression after associated variables were identified by univariate analysis.\nOf the 4587 CEAs performed, 46% utilized protamine, while 54% did not. Fourteen patients (0.64%) in the protamine-treated group required reoperation for bleeding compared with 42 patients (1.66%) in the untreated cohort (P = .001). Protamine use did not affect the rate of MI (1.1% vs 0.91%, P = .51), stroke (0.78% vs 1.15%, P = .2), or death (0.23% vs 0.32%, P = .57) between treated and untreated patients, respectively. By multivariate analysis, protamine (odds ratio [OR] 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.63; P = .001) and patch angioplasty (OR 0.46, 95% CI, 0.26-0.81; P = .007) were independently associated with diminished reoperation for bleeding. A single center was associated with a significantly higher rate of reoperation for bleeding (OR 6.47, 95% CI, 3.02-13.9; P < .001). Independent of protamine use, consequences of reoperation for bleeding were significant, with a four-fold increase in MI, a seven-fold increase in stroke, and a 30-fold increase in death.\nProtamine reduced serious bleeding requiring reoperation during CEA without increasing the risk of MI, stroke, or death, in this large, contemporary registry. In light of significant complications referable to bleeding, liberal use of protamine during CEA appears warranted.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of cardiac disease in patients undergoing vascular surgery (VS) is important for patients and vascular surgeons. Recent evidence has emerged that has allowed us to develop contemporary paradigms for evaluating and managing coronary artery disease in VS patients perioperatively.\nThe utility of stress testing, the role of preoperative coronary revascularization, the optimal use of beta-blockers and statins, and the role of antiplatelet therapy in VS patients were reviewed in the literature.\nThe revised Lee cardiac risk index, based on the number of risk factors (high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hypertension, and age >75) quantitates cardiac risk. Stress testing is not predictive of myocardial ischemia/infarction (MI) or death and is only recommended in patients with unstable angina or an active arrhythmia. Stress testing for patients with 0 to 2 risk factors delays VS up to 3 weeks. In high-risk patients (>or=3 risk factors), it helps to identify patients who may develop myocardial ischemia and would benefit from a 30-day period to optimize medical therapy before VS. Stress testing and coronary catheterization do not predict which coronary artery to revascularize to prevent MI or death. Revascularization does not decrease MI or death rates at 1 month or 6 years. Although beta-blocker treatment decreases cardiac risk with VS, timing and dosage (titration) influence outcomes, improper usage may increase stroke and death rate, and not all VS patients should be taking these drugs. Patients with >or=1 risk factor should be considered to begin a low dose beta-blocker 1 month before VS. Preoperative statin use sharply decreases MI, stroke, and death perioperatively and long-term postoperatively.\nRoutine stress testing should not be performed before VS. The Lee index should be used to stratify risk in patients undergoing VS. Patients with >or=3 risk factors or active cardiac conditions should undergo stress testing, if VS can be delayed. All VS patients, except those with 0 risk factors, should be considered for a beta-blocker (bisoprolol, 2.5-5 mg/d started 1 month before VS, titrated to a pulse <70 beats/min and a systolic blood pressure >or=120 mm Hg). Intermediate risk factors may not require aggressive heart rate control but simply maintenance on a low-dose beta-blocker. Statins should be started (ideally 30 days) before all VS using long-acting formulations such as fluvastatin (80 mg/d) for patients unable to take oral medication.",

In high-risk patients (>or=3 risk factors), it helps to identify patients who may develop myocardial ischemia and would benefit from a 30-day period to optimize medical therapy before VS. Stress testing and coronary catheterization do not predict which coronary artery to revascularize to prevent MI or death. Revascularization does not decrease MI or death rates at 1 month or 6 years. Although beta-blocker treatment decreases cardiac risk with VS, timing and dosage (titration) influence outcomes, improper usage may increase stroke and death rate, and not all VS patients should be taking these drugs. Patients with >or=1 risk factor should be considered to begin a low dose beta-blocker 1 month before VS. Preoperative statin use sharply decreases MI, stroke, and death perioperatively and long-term postoperatively.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need for vascular grafts in the field of surgical revascularization. However, smaller vascular grafts made from synthetic biomaterials, particularly those <5 mm in diameter, are associated with a high incidence of thrombosis. Fibroin is a biodegradable protein derived from silk. Silk fibroin from Bombyx mori provides an antithrombotic surface and serves as a scaffold for various cell types in tissue engineering. We evaluated the potential of fibroin to generate a vascular prosthesis for small arteries.\nA small vessel with three layers was woven from silk fibroin thread. These fibroin-based grafts (1.5 mm diameter, 10 mm length) were implanted into the abdominal aorta of 10- to 14-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats by end-to-end anastomosis. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based grafts were used as the control. To investigate the origin of the cells in the neointima and media, bone marrow transplantation was performed from green fluorescent protein (GFP) rats to wild-type rats.\nThe patency of fibroin grafts at 1 year after implantation was significantly higher than that of PTFE grafts (85.1% vs 30%, P < .01). Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) migrated into the fibroin graft early after implantation and became organized into endothelial and medial layers, as determined by anti-CD31 and anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin immunostaining. The total number of SMCs increased 1.6-fold from 1 month to 3 months. Vasa vasorum also formed in the adventitia. Sirius red staining of the fibroin grafts revealed that the content of collagen significantly increased at 1 year after implantation, with a decrease in fibroin content. GFP-positive cells contributed to organization of a smooth muscle layer.\nSmall-diameter fibroin-based vascular grafts have excellent long-term patency. Bone marrow-derived cells contribute to vascular remodeling after graft implantation. Fibroin might be a promising material to engineer vascular prostheses for small arteries.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the rates of postoperative infectious complications and death after elective vascular surgery, define vascular procedures with the greatest risk of developing nosocomial infections, and assess the effect of infection on health care resource utilization.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2006) was used to identify major vascular procedures by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Infectious complications identified included pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI), postoperative sepsis, and surgical site infections (SSI). Case-mix-adjusted rates were calculated using a multivariate logistic regression model for infectious complication or death as an outcome and indirect standardization.\nA total of 870,778 elective vascular surgical procedures were estimated and evaluated with an overall postoperative infection rate of 3.70%. Open abdominal aortic surgery had the greatest rate of postoperative infections, followed by open thoracic procedures and aorta-iliac-femoral bypass. Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) infectious complication rates were two times greater than after EVAR (P < .0001). Pneumonia was the most common infectious complication after open aortic surgery (6.63%). UTI was the most common after TEVAR (2.86%) and EVAR (1.31%). Infectious complications were greater in octogenarians (P < .0002), women (P < .0001), and blacks (P < .0001 vs whites and Hispanics). Nosocomial infections after elective vascular surgery significantly increased hospital length of stay (13.8 +/- 15.4 vs 3.5 +/- 4.2 days; P < .001) and reported total hospital cost ($37,834 +/- $42,905 vs $11,851 +/- $11,816; P < .001).\nElective vascular surgical procedures vary widely in the estimated risk of postoperative infection. Open aortic surgery and endarterectomy of the head and neck vessels have, respectively, the greatest and the lowest reported incidence for postoperative infectious complications. Women, octogenarians, and blacks have the highest risk of infectious complications after elective vascular surgery. Disparities in the development of infectious complications on a systems level were also found in larger hospitals and teaching hospitals. Hospital infectious complications were found to significantly increase health care resource utilization. Strategies that reduce nosocomial complications and target high-risk procedures may offer significant future cost savings.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) can be limited by inadequate proximal and distal landing zones. Debranching or hybrid TEVAR has emerged as an important modality to expand landing zones and facilitate TEVAR. We report a single-center experience with hybrid TEVAR.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients with thoracic aortic disease who received a TEVAR between February 2005 and October 2008.\nForty-two patients underwent a hybrid procedure (mean age 68 +/- 13 years; 55% men). All patients were denied open surgery due to preoperative comorbidities or low physiologic reserve; 62% had a history of coronary artery disease, 67% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 61% had undergone prior aortic surgery, and 90% had an American Society of Anesthesiology score of 4 and above. The average Society for Vascular Surgery comorbidity score was 12 +/- 2 with a range of 9 to 14. Fifty-five percent of cases were symptomatic on presentation and 83% were done emergently. Seventy-six percent underwent debranching of the aortic arch, 17% of the visceral vessels, and 7% required both. Primary technical success was achieved in all cases and of these, 43% were staged. The 30-day mortality was 5%. Myocardial infarction developed in 5%, respiratory failure in 31%, cerebrovascular accident (stroke or transient ischemic attack) in 19%, and spinal cord ischemia with ensuant paraplegia occurred in 5% of patients. Fifty-eight percent of patients were discharged home, 11% required rehabilitation, and 29% were transferred to a skilled nursing facility. There was a significant association between visceral vessel debranching and both spinal cord ischemia (P = .004) and gastrointestinal complications (P = .005). On the other hand, there was no difference between staged and non-staged hybrid procedures.\nHybrid procedures can successfully extend the range of patients suitable for a subsequent TEVAR. These procedures are associated with higher complication rates than isolated infrarenal or thoracic endovascular repair, but given the medical and anatomical complexity of these patients, the current results are quite encouraging.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVI) has improved with widespread adaptation of screening protocols and more accurate multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT-A) angiography. The population at risk and for whom screening is indicated is still controversial. To help determine which blunt trauma patients would best benefit from screening we performed a comprehensive analysis of risk factors associated with BCVI.\nAll patients with BCVI from June 12, 2000 (the date at which our institution began screening for these injuries) to June 30, 2009 were identified by the primary author (JDB) and recorded in a prospective database. Associated injuries were identified retrospectively by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code and compared with similar patients without BCVI. Demographic information was also compared from data obtained from the trauma registry. Univariate analyses exploring associations between individual risk factors and BCVI were performed using Fisher's exact test for dichotomous variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Additionally, relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous variables to describe the strength of the relationship between the categorical risk factors and BCVI. Multivariate logistic regression models for BCVI, BCAI (blunt internal carotid artery injury), and BVAI (blunt vertebral artery injury) were developed to explore the relative contributions of the various risk factors.\nOne hundred two patients with BCVI were identified out of 9935 blunt trauma patients admitted during this time period (1.03% incidence). Fifty-nine patients (0.59% incidence) had a BVAI and 43 patients (0.43% incidence) had a BCAI. Univariate analysis found cervical spine fracture (CSI) (RR = 10.4), basilar skull fracture (RR = 3.60), and mandible fracture (RR = 2.51) to be most predictive of the presence of BCVI (P < .005). Independent predictors of BCVI on multivariate logistic regression were CSI (OR = 7.46), mandible fracture (OR = 2.59), basilar skull fracture (OR = 1.76), injury severity score (ISS) (OR = 1.05), and emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale (ED-GCS) (OR = 0.93): all P < .05.\nBlunt trauma patients with a high risk mechanism and a low GCS, high injury severity score, mandible fracture, basilar skull fracture, or cervical spine injury are at high risk for BCVI should be screened with MDCT-A.",

    "abstract": "In the decision for surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the maximum diameter is the main factor. Several studies have concluded that the diameter may not be reliable as rupture risk criterion for the individual patient and wall stress was found to have a higher sensitivity and specificity. The AAA wall stress may also be an influential factor in growth of the AAA. This study investigates the effect of intraluminal thrombus on the wall stress and growth rate of aneurysms, using both idealized and patient-specific AAA models in wall stress computations.\nIdealized AAA models were created for wall stress analysis. Thrombus was modeled as an incompressible linear elastic material and was fixed to the wall. The reduction in wall stress for a range of thrombus volumes and shear moduli was computed. For 30 patient-specific AAA models with varying thrombus volumes, the wall stress was computed with and without thrombus. The diameter growth rate was compared for AAAs with a small and large thrombus volume. The results were compared between the idealized and patient-specific models.\nThe thrombus caused a reduction in wall stress, which was stronger for larger thrombi and higher elastic moduli. Any AAAs with a large thrombus were found to have significant stronger growth in diameter than aneurysms with a small thrombus (P < .01). The stress reduction due to the thrombus showed the same trend for the idealized and patient-specific models, although the effect was overestimated by the idealized models and a considerable variation between patients was observed.\nA larger thrombus in AAA was associated with a higher AAA growth rate, but also with a lower wall stress. Therefore, weakening of the AAA wall, under the influence of thrombus, may play a more imminent role in the process of AAA growth than the stress acting on the wall.",

Any AAAs with a large thrombus were found to have significant stronger growth in diameter than aneurysms with a small thrombus (P < .01). The stress reduction due to the thrombus showed the same trend for the idealized and patient-specific models, although the effect was overestimated by the idealized models and a considerable variation between patients was observed.",

    "abstract": "Using 30-day operative mortality reported with lower extremity bypass (LEB) in preoperative decision making may underestimate the actual death rate encountered before patients have truly recovered from surgery, especially in elderly, debilitated patients with significant tissue loss. Therefore, we examined preoperative, patient-level risk factors that predict survival within the first year following LEB.\nUsing our regional quality improvement initiative in 11 hospitals in Northern New England, we studied 2306 LEB procedures performed in 2031 patients between January 2003 and December 2007. Sixty surgeons contributed to our database, and over 100 demographic and clinical variables were abstracted by trained researchers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HR) and surrounding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for our combined outcome measure of death occurring within the first year postoperatively.\nWe found that within our cohort of 2306 bypass procedures, 11% of patients died within 1 year of surgery (2% prior to discharge, 9% prior to 1-year follow-up). We identified six preoperative patient characteristics associated with higher risk of death in multivariate analysis: congestive heart failure (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), critical limb ischemia (CLI) (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.4), lack of single-segment saphenous vein (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2/5), age over 80 (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), dialysis dependence (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-3.6), and emergent nature of the procedure (HR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.8). While patients with no risk factors had 1-year death rates that were less than 5%: patients with three or more risk factors had a 28% chance of dying before 1 year postoperatively. When we compared risk-adjusted survival across centers, we found that one center in our region performed significantly better than expected (observed-to-expected outcome ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9, P = .04).\nPreoperative risk factors allow surgeons to predict survival in the first year following LEB, and to more precisely inform patients about their operative risk with LEB. Additionally, our model facilitates benchmarking comparison of risk-adjusted outcomes across our region. We believe quality improvement measures such as these will allow surgeons to identify best practices and thereby improve outcomes with LEB across centers.",

    "abstract": "Limited endothelial cell (EC) coverage and anastomotic intimal hyperplasia contribute to thrombosis and failure of prosthetic grafts. Lipid accumulation and lipid oxidation are associated with decreased EC migration and intimal hyperplasia. The goal of this study was to assess the ability of antioxidants to improve graft healing in hypercholesterolemic animals.\nRabbits were placed in one of four groups: chow plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC), chow plus probucol, chow with 1% cholesterol plus NAC, or chow with 1% cholesterol plus probucol. After 2 weeks, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (12 cm long x 4-mm internal diameter) were implanted in the abdominal aorta. Grafts were removed after 6 weeks and analyzed for cholesterol content, EC coverage, anastomotic intimal thickness, and the cellular composition of the neointima. Plasma samples were obtained to assess systemic oxidative stress. The data were compared with previously reported data from animals fed diets of chow and chow with 1% cholesterol.\nProsthetic grafts from rabbits fed chow with 1% cholesterol had significantly greater anastomotic intimal thickening and lower EC coverage than grafts from rabbits fed a regular chow diet. In hypercholesterolemic rabbits, antioxidant therapy decreased global oxidative stress as evidenced by a 40% decrease in plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In rabbits fed the chow with 1% cholesterol diet, NAC decreased intimal hyperplasia at the proximal anastomosis by 29% and significantly increased graft EC coverage from 46% to 71% (P = .03). Following a similar pattern, probucol decreased intimal hyperplasia by 43% and increased graft EC coverage to 53% in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.\nGlobal oxidative stress and anastomotic intimal hyperplasia are increased, and endothelialization of prosthetic grafts is significantly reduced in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet. Antioxidant treatment improves EC coverage and decreases intimal hyperplasia. Reducing oxidative stress may promote healing of prosthetic grafts.",

Both endoleak type and exact source of endoleak have implications upon the urgency and complexity of future management strategies. Herein we report on a patient with a documented endoleak post-f-EVAR, in which the source of blood flow into the aneurysm sac could not be determined using conventional computed tomographic angiography. Consequently, dynamic volumetric computed tomographic angiography (DV-CTA) was employed, which clearly illustrated the site of origin of the endoleak.

    "abstract": "The contribution of hereditary and environmental factors to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is still partly unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of these factors in a large population-based sample of twins.\nThe Swedish Twin Registry, containing data on twins born in the country since 1886, was cross-linked with the Inpatient Registry, providing national coverage of discharge diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). All twins with an infrarenal AAA were identified. Concordance rates and tetrachoric correlations were calculated for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Tetrachoric correlations were calculated assuming an underlying normal distribution of liability, with multiple factors contributing additively and a threshold value that discriminates between AAA and no AAA. Higher concordance rates and correlations of liability in MZ twins than in DZ twins suggest that genetic factors influence disease development. Structural equation modeling techniques, Mx-analyses, were used to estimate the contributions of genetic effects as well as shared and nonshared environmental factors for development of AAA.\nThere were 172,890 twins registered at the time of the study including 265 twins (81% men; mean age 72 years; range, 48-94) with AAA. There were 7 MZ and 5 DZ concordant pairs as well as 44 MZ and 197 DZ discordant pairs with AAA. The probandwise concordance rates for MZ and DZ pairs were 24% and 4.8%, respectively. The tetrachoric correlations were 0.71 in MZ pairs and 0.31 in DZ pairs. The odds ratio (OR) was 71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 27-183) for MZ twins and 7.6 (95% CI 3.0-19) for DZ twins. In the structural equation models, genetic effects accounted for 70% (95% CI 0.33-0.83), shared environmental effects for 0% (95% CI 0-0.27), and nonshared environmental effects for 30% (95% CI 0.17-0.46) of the phenotypic variance among twins.\nThese data provide robust epidemiologic evidence that heritability contributes to aneurysm formation. Concordances and correlations were higher in MZ compared with DZ twins, indicating genetic effects. There was a 24% probability that an MZ twin of a person with AAA will have the disease. The twin of an MZ twin with AAA had a risk of AAA that was 71 times that of the MZ twin of a person without AAA. A heritability of 70% of the total trait variance was estimated. The remaining variance was explained by nonshared environmental factors with no support for a role of shared environmental influences.",

Histologic evaluations were carried out 1 month and 3 months after surgery. The biomechanical strength of the anastomosis was assessed along the longitudinal axis of the aortic segments using a tensile tester. Local compliance at the anastomotic site was also evaluated in the circumferential direction.\nThe media was significantly thinner in the PTFE group than in the control group (65.8% +/- 5.1% vs 95.0% +/- 9.3% of normal thickness; P < .05). Relative to the control group, the adventitial layer was significantly thinner in the PTFE group (42.3% +/- 8.2% of control; P < .05) but significantly thicker in the PGA and the PGA + bFGF groups (117.2% +/- 11.3% and 134.1% +/- 14.2% of control, respectively; P < .05). There were more vessels in the adventitial layer in the PGA + bFGF group than in the control, PTFE, and PGA groups (29.2 +/- 2.1/mm(2) vs 13.8 +/- 0.8, 5.4 +/- 0.7, 17.0 +/- 1.3/mm(2), respectively; P < .01). There were no significant differences between the four groups in the failure force at anastomotic sites. Local compliance at the anastomotic site was higher in the PGA group than that in the PTFE group (11.6 +/- 1.6 10(-6) m(2)/N vs 5.6 +/- 1.9 10(-6) m(2)/N; P < .05).\nReinforcement of the experimental aortic wall with PTFE felt resulted in thinning of the media and adventitia and fewer vessels at the anastomotic site. These histologic changes were not observed when biodegradable felt was used. The bFGF failed to augment the modification of the aortic wall with the exception of increased adventitial vessel number.

    "abstract": "Health economic arguments have become increasingly important in clinical decision making, especially when new treatment modalities are introduced. This study reviews the methods used in health economic reports of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and uses original cost data to study how different methods affect interpretation of results in terms of cost differences and economic efficiency.\nPublications referenced in PubMed from 2003 to 2008 studying cost of AAA repair were reviewed. Original population-based cost data of AAA repair were analyzed, comparing open (OR) and endovascular repair (EVAR). Means, medians, and cost distributions were calculated, and differences were analyzed with four different statistical methods.\nThe review showed a mixture of statistical methods used in AAA treatment cost-comparison studies. Presentation of cost data and inclusion criteria varied between studies. The analysis of original data showed skewed distribution of cost data, with large differences between mean and median cost. Although mean values indicated a lower total, perioperative, and postoperative cost for EVAR, the median values indicated OR was the least costly method. Exclusion of extreme values lowered mean perioperative cost of OR by 10%, while cost of EVAR was unaffected. Inferential testing of cost differences by means of four statistical methods showed that P values were highly dependent on test methodology.\nConclusions of health economic reports can be highly dependent on how the data are presented and the statistical methods that are used. We recommend that cost data be presented as mean values with distributions. Exclusion of outliers and focus on P values should be avoided.",

    "abstract": "Our institution treats about 30 patients per year with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). Between 2002 and 2007, our 30-day mortality averaged 58%. In July 2007, we implemented an algorithm to promote endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) when feasible. This report describes the outcome with this approach.\nData on patients presenting with rAAA between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2007, were reviewed and used for comparison to prospectively collected data. Data on patients presenting between July 1, 2007, and April 30, 2009, were collected on all patients after implementation of a structured protocol. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a log-rank test were performed to compare survival times for three groups (pre-protocol, post-protocol with open surgery, and post-protocol with EVAR).\nDuring the study period, 187 patients with rAAA presented to our institution. Before implementation of the algorithm, 131 patients with rAAA presented and 128 were treated. The 30-day mortality rate was 57.8%. After implementation of the protocol, 56 patients with rAAA were managed. Twenty-seven patients (48%) underwent successful EVAR, and 24 patients (43%) underwent open repair. Five patients (9%) underwent comfort care only. In the post-protocol period, 5 patients in the EVAR group (18.5%) and 13 patients in the open group (54.2%) died during the follow-up period for an overall 30-day mortality rate of 35.3% (P = .008 vs 57.8% pre-protocol). After implementation of a structured protocol for managing rAAA, there was a relative risk reduction in 30-day mortality of 35% compared to the time before implementation of the protocol (95% confidence interval [CI], 14%-51%) corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 22.5% (95% CI, 6.8%-38.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20-0.78; P = .007). After adjusting for key factors predicting mortality, the odds ratio is 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P = .001).\nUse of an algorithm favoring endovascular repair resulted in a highly significant reduction in rAAA mortality in our urban hospital. Thirty-day mortality for open repair was no different between pre- and post-protocol eras. With modern techniques of resuscitation and surgical management, a majority of patients presenting with rAAA can survive.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between the orientation of the iliac arteries in infrarenal aortic aneurysms and its effect on the cannulation of the contralateral limb of a bifurcated stent graft system (SGS) used for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThis is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data in 100 consecutive patients treated with EVAR using the Zenith device (Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, Indiana, USA). We collected data on reciprocal orientation between the origins of the common iliac arteries (OOCIA) on an axial plane, the common femoral artery (right or left) used to deliver the main body of the SGS (access side), and the cannulation time of the contralateral limb. The latter was defined as the time elapsed between the introduction of the selective catheter in the contralateral iliac artery to the time of successful cannulation of the contralateral limb of the SGS. Using an Aquarius workstation (v. 3.5; TeraRecon Inc, San Mateo, Calif), the OOCIA was measured establishing the center of the origin of the right and left common iliac arteries and joining them using a straight line. A horizontal line was then drawn through the origin of the right common iliac artery. The angle created by these two lines was defined as \"zero,\" \"positive,\" or \"negative.\" We examined the relations between cannulation time, access side, and OOCIA using t tests and a multivariate regression analysis.\nIn 84 patients, the origin of the right common iliac artery was in an anterior position compared with the left; in 16, the origin of the right and left were on the same horizontal line; and the right common iliac artery was posterior in none of the patients. The main body of the prosthesis was delivered using the left femoral artery in 52 patients and the right in 48. When all patients were considered, cannulation time was shorter when the main body of the bifurcated prosthesis was delivered through the left femoral artery (9.3 +/- 5.8 minutes vs 15.4 +/- 7.2 minutes, P < .0001). This effect was more pronounced when only patients with the left common iliac artery located posteriorly were examined (9.3 +/- 5.80 minutes vs 16.4 +/- 7.6 minutes, P < .0001). There was no correlation between increasing negativity of the OOCIA angle and cannulation time, regardless of access side.\nWe have shown that in patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms, the origin of the right iliac artery is often anterior compared with the left and that cannulation time of the contralateral limb is shorter when the main body of the prosthesis is delivered from the left.",

    "abstract": "The goals of this study were to determine if endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) affects both early and late collateral arterial adaptation and blood flow recovery after severe limb ischemia in a mouse model and to determine if eNOS-derived NO is necessary for recruitment of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)(+) vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1)(+) hemangiocytes to the site of ischemia.\nTwo studies were completed. In the first, hind limb ischemia was induced by unilateral femoral artery excision in three groups: C57Bl6 (wild-type), eNOS(-/-), and C57Bl/6 mice treated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) from 1 day before excision through day 3 after excision (early L-NAME group). These groups were studied on day 3 after induction of ischemia. In the second study, hind limb ischemia was induced in C57Bl/6 mice (wild-type) and C57Bl/6 mice treated with L-NAME from days 3 through 28 after induction of ischemia. These groups were studied day 28 after ischemia induction. Dependent variables included hind limb perfusion, collateral artery diameter, and the number and location of hemangiocytes within the ischemic hind limb.\nIn the first study, toe gangrene developed in the eNOS(-/-) and early L-NAME treatment groups by day 2. These groups demonstrated less blood flow recovery and smaller collateral artery diameter than the wild-type group. Hemangiocytes were present within the adventitia of collateral arteries in the wild-type group but were only sparsely present, in a random pattern, in the eNOS(-/-) and early L-NAME treatment groups. In the second study, the late L-NAME group showed less blood flow recovery and smaller collateral artery diameter on day 28 of ischemia than the wild-type group. Hemangiocytes were present in a pericapillary distribution in the wild-type group, but were present only sparsely in the late L-NAME treatment group.\nEarly (day 3) and late (day 28) adaptive responses to hind limb ischemia both require eNOS-derived NO. NO is necessary for normal hemangiocyte recruitment to the ischemic tissue.",

    "abstract": "Severe stenosis of the common carotid artery (CCA), while uncommon, is associated with increased risk of transient ischemic attack and stroke. To date, no validated duplex ultrasound criteria have been established for grading the severity of CCA stenosis. The goal of this study was to use receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis with computed tomographic angiography as the reference standard to establish duplex ultrasound criteria for diagnosing >or=50% CCA stenosis.\nThe study cohort included 64 patients (42 men, 22 women) with a mean age of 65 +/- 12 years (range, 16-89 years) who had CCA peak systolic velocity (PSV) >or=150 cm/sec and underwent computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the cervical and intracerebral vessels within 1 month of the duplex examination. One study was excluded because the CTA was technically inadequate, whereas another was excluded because the patient underwent bilateral CCA stenting. The CCA ipsilateral to any of the following was excluded from the analysis: innominate artery occlusion (n = 1), previous stenting of the ICA or CCA (n = 7), carotid endarterectomy (n = 1), or carotid-to-carotid bypass (n = 1). Thus, the data set included 62 patients and 115 vessels. Bland-Altman analysis was used to examine the agreement between two measures of luminal reduction measured by CTA: percent diameter stenosis and percent area stenosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal PSV and EDV thresholds for diagnosing >or=50% CCA stenosis.\nSeverity of CCA stenosis was <50% in 76 vessels, 50%-59% in eight, 60%-69% in eight, 70%-79% in nine, 80%-89% in three, 90%-99% in five, and occluded in six. Duplex ultrasonography identified six of six (100%) patients with 100% CCA occlusion by CTA. Bland-Altman analysis showed poor agreement between percent stenosis determined by vessel diameter compared with percent stenosis determined by reduction in lumen area. Therefore, subsequent analysis was performed using percent stenosis by area. ROC analysis of different PSV thresholds for detecting stenosis >or=50% showed that >182 cm/sec was the most accurate with a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 88% (P < .0001). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of carotid duplex were higher when the stenosis was located in the mid or distal aspects of the CCA (sensitivity 76%, specificity 89%, area under curve 0.84, P < .001) than in the intrathoracic and proximal segment of the artery (P = NS). ROC analysis of different EDV thresholds for detecting CCA stenosis >or=50% showed that >30 cm/sec was the most accurate with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 74% (P < .0239).\nDuplex ultrasonography is highly sensitive, specific, and accurate for detecting CCA lesions in the mid and distal CCA. Use of peak systolic velocity may lead to improved detection of CCA disease and initiation of appropriate therapy to reduce the risk of stroke.",

    "abstract": "Although carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy in cerebral revascularization, restenosis remains an unsolved issue. Cilostazol is a unique antiplatelet drug that has vasodilatory effects and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. We investigated whether cilostazol reduces restenosis after CAS.\nA database of 113 consecutive CAS procedures between April 2002 and December 2007 was assessed retrospectively. All patients received aspirin (100 mg/d) and another antiplatelet drug such as cilostazol (200 mg/d), ticlopidine (200 mg/d), or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) at least 3 days before CAS. Two antiplatelet drugs were continued for 2 to 3 months after CAS and reduced to one thereafter. Patients were evaluated at 3 and 6 months and at 6-month intervals thereafter with duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging. Angiography was used for confirmation when stenosis was suspected as >50% with DUS imaging.\nWe were able to monitor 97 patients for a 12-month period. The overall combined rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death was 3.1% at 30 days and 4.1% at 1 year. In-stent recurrent stenosis was documented in 11 patients (11%); in 10 patients (9.7%), this occurred <or=12 months of CAS. In-stent restenosis was significantly reduced in the cilostazol (+) group (0% vs 15.7% [11 of 70], P = .03). Patient characteristics were similar between the cilostazol (+) and cilostazol (-) groups.\nAlthough this study was retrospective and nonrandomized, the results suggest that cilostazol administration improves long-term patency after CAS due to its inhibitory effect on smooth muscle cell growth.",

    "abstract": "There has been debate regarding the safety of performing elective procedures in patients with vascular manifestations associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The purpose of this study was to review the surgical management and clinical outcomes of EDS patients undergoing vascular procedures at a tertiary medical center with multimodality expertise in connective tissue disorders.\nAll patients with EDS undergoing endovascular and open vascular procedures at a single-institution academic medical center from 1994 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data were evaluated including patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), and mortality outcomes during hospital course and long-term follow-up.\nA total of 40 patients with EDS were identified, including individuals diagnosed with classic (n = 15), hypermobility (n = 16), and vascular (n = 9) types of EDS. These patients collectively underwent 45 endovascular and 18 open procedures for vascular disease during the time period, including embolization (n = 37), angioplasty (n = 8), arterial bypass (n = 5), and aortic aneurysm repair (n = 13). All cases were performed electively, except for one (2%) urgent endovascular and one (5%) emergent open procedure. Endovascular procedures were associated with a median LOS (interquartile range [IQR]) of 2 (1 to 3) days with no procedure-related mortality or in-hospital deaths among all EDS types, whereas open vascular procedures had median LOS (IQR) of 6 (5 to 8) days with one (6%) in-hospital death occurring in a vascular EDS patient. Survival free of any complication at 5 years was 85% and 54% following endovascular and open procedures, respectively.\nThe elective surgical management of vascular disorders in EDS patients using open and endovascular procedures has been associated with good outcomes. Our results suggest that vascular interventions in these EDS patients can be safely performed and should not be withheld until rupture or acute symptoms arise.",

This study determined resolution rates and factors associated with resolution of CAUEDVT.\nFrom January 1, 2002, to June 30, 2006, 1761 upper extremity venous duplex ultrasound (DU) studies were performed, and a new UEDVT was found in 253 (14.4%). Of these, 150 patients had routine follow-up and 101 had CAUEDVT. Demographics, follow-up DU results, and risk factors for venous thrombosis were recorded in the patients with follow-up studies and CAUEDVT. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for complete thrombus resolution.\nThere were 49 men (49%) and 52 women (51%) with CAUEDVT and follow-up studies. Mean age was 49 years (range, 5 months-80 years). Patients with CAUEDVT had risk factors for venous thrombosis that included malignancy in 34%, recent surgery/trauma in 34%, known hypercoagulable state in 11%, concomitant lower extremity DVT in 21%, and pulmonary embolism in 5%. Complete resolution of DVT on follow-up was documented in 46%. Thrombosis resolved in only 25% (6 of 24) when the catheter was not removed (P <or= .05). Anticoagulation did not improve the rate of thrombus resolution (P <or= 1.0) compared with catheter removal alone. Of the patients who had thrombus resolution, 75% resolved by 100 days (range, 1-914 days) after catheter removal <or=48 hours of diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Renal failure after thoracoabdominal aortic repair is a significant clinical problem. Distal aortic perfusion for organ and spinal cord protection requires cannulation of the left femoral artery. In 2006, we reported the finding that direct cannulation led to leg ischemia in some patients and was associated with increased renal failure. After this finding, we modified our perfusion technique to eliminate leg ischemia from cannulation. In this article, we present the effects of this change on postoperative renal function.\nBetween February 1991 and July 2008, we repaired 1464 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Distal aortic perfusion was used in 1088, and these were studied. Median patient age was 68 years, and 378 (35%) were women. In September 2006, we began to adopt a sidearm femoral cannulation technique that provides distal aortic perfusion while maintaining downstream flow to the leg. This was used in 167 patients (15%). We measured the joint effects of preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and cannulation technique on the highest postoperative creatinine level, postoperative renal failure, and death. Analysis was by multiple linear or logistic regression with interaction.\nThe preoperative GFR was the strongest predictor of postoperative renal dysfunction and death. No significant main effects of sidearm cannulation were noted. For peak creatinine level and postoperative renal failure, however, strong interactions between preoperative GFR and sidearm cannulation were present, resulting in reductions of postoperative renal complications of 15% to 20% when GFR was <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). For normal GFR, the effect was negated or even reversed at very high levels of GFR. Mortality, although not significantly affected by sidearm cannulation, showed a similar trend to the renal outcomes.\nUse of sidearm cannulation is associated with a clinically important and highly statistically significant reduction in postoperative renal complications in patients with a low GFR. Reduced renal effect of skeletal muscle ischemia is the proposed mechanism. Effects among patients with good preoperative renal function are less clear. A randomized trial is needed.",

For peak creatinine level and postoperative renal failure, however, strong interactions between preoperative GFR and sidearm cannulation were present, resulting in reductions of postoperative renal complications of 15% to 20% when GFR was <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). For normal GFR, the effect was negated or even reversed at very high levels of GFR. Mortality, although not significantly affected by sidearm cannulation, showed a similar trend to the renal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaque stabilization is a promising strategy to prevent cerebrovascular events in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Vascular calcification inhibitors, known osteopontin (OPN) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), have emerged as novel cardiovascular biomarkers. This open-label, prospective study aimed to examine whether aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin is more effective than moderate lipid-lowering in increasing carotid plaque echogenicity, assessed by Gray-Scale Median (GSM) score and suppressing serum OPN and OPG levels in patients with moderate carotid stenosis.\nOne hundred forty patients (64 males, 76 females), aged 50 to 75 years, with carotid stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET]: 30%-60% for symptomatic and 30%-70% for asymptomatic), but without indications for surgical intervention, were enrolled. Patients with coronary heart disease, renal failure, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and ongoing use of statins were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to: Group A (N = 70): Moderate lipid-lowering therapy with low-dose of atorvastatin (10 mg-20 mg) to target LDL-C <100 mg/dL. Group B (N = 70): Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with high-dose of atorvastatin (80 mg) to target LDL-C <70 mg/dL. Blood pressure, lipid and glycemic indexes, hsCRP, serum OPN, and OPG were measured at baseline and after 12 months as well as the GSM score. Independent samples t test, paired samples t test, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used (P < .05).\nThere were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Three patients in group A experienced either cerebrovascular or cardiac ischemic attacks, while two patients in group B underwent coronary angioplasty during follow-up. Group B showed a more pronounced improvement in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared with group A (P < .05). Moreover, atorvastatin treatment suppressed serum hsCRP, OPN, and OPG levels from baseline in both groups (P < .001). Notably, aggressive treatment decreased OPN (P = .012) and OPG (P = .025) levels to a greater degree compared with moderate treatment. Similarly, GSM score was remarkably increased in both groups, but that augmentation was greater in group B (from 66.39 +/- 23.66 to 100.4 +/- 25.31) than in group A (from 64.4 +/- 23.62 to 85.39 +/- 20.21) (P = .024). No change in the degree of carotid stenosis was noted in both treatment arms. Importantly, the aforementioned reduction in OPN (r = -0.517, P = .024) and OPG (r = -0.312, P = .008) levels was inversely associated with GSM score changes in univariate and standard multiple regression analysis (R(2) = 0.411, P = .021).\nAmong patients with moderate carotid stenosis, an aggressive atorvastatin regimen enhanced carotid plaque echogenicity and reduced serum OPN and OPG levels to a greater extent than respective moderate atorvastatin therapy. Most importantly, those atorvastatin-induced effects were associated with OPN and OPG suppression in a dose-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Varicose veins are common and increasingly are being treated by less invasive endoscopic methods such as foam sclerotherapy. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is also common, present in approximately one-quarter of adults. PFO allows bubbles introduced by foam sclerotherapy to cross into the general circulation, potentially causing cerebral artery gas embolization with unevaluated consequences.\nMen and women aged 18 to 60 years with symptomatic varicose veins (CEAP C(3-5)) responded to an advertisement to recruit volunteers for a study on endovenous microfoam ablation (EMA). Participants' veins were screened by duplex ultrasound imaging, and those with isolated great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence were tested for right-to-left (R-L) vascular shunt using transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery to detect the presence of bubble emboli after an injection of an agitated saline, blood, and air mixture as a contrast at rest and with the Valsalva maneuver.\nOf 221 participants tested for R-L shunt, 85 (38.5%) were positive at rest (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.5-45.2) and 114 (51.8%) were positive after the Valsalva maneuver (95% CI, 45.4-58.5). A total 130 patients (58.8%) were positive for R-L shunt at rest or after Valsalva (95% CI, 52.5%-65.1%). This is significantly higher than the reported 26% prevalence of PFO in the general population (95% CI, 24.4-30.1).\nThe prevalence of R-L shunt in patients with GSV incompetence CEAP C(3-5) in this study was higher than expected in the general population. TCD does not differentiate between intracardiac shunts and intrapulmonary shunts, so this observation needs further investigation. This link between R-L shunt and varicose veins is novel and, whether etiologic or functional, may improve the understanding of both conditions. The findings have importance in the treatment of varicose veins with foam sclerotherapy and EMA.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endovascular repair (EVAR) for small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nWe developed a Markov model of a hypothetical 68-year-old cohort to determine the cost-effectiveness of early EVAR for \"small\" AAAs (4.0 cm-5.4 cm) compared with elective repair (open or endovascular) at the traditional cut-off of 5.5 cm. Repair options for 5.5-cm AAAs include both endovascular and open procedures. Probabilities were obtained from the literature. Costs reflected direct costs in 2007 dollars. Outcomes were reported as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).\nThe model demonstrated that early EVAR for 4.0 cm-5.4 cm AAAs led to fewer QALYs at greater costs when compared with observational management with elective repair at 5.5 cm. Sensitivity analyses suggested that early EVAR of 4.6 cm-4.9 cm AAAs can be cost-effective if the long-term mortality rate after EVAR is <or=1.91% per year or if the quality of life after EVAR is improved. Likewise, if the quality of life before repair is low, EVAR for AAAs >or=4.6 cm may be cost-effective. With a >70% probability, observational management until AAA diameter is 5.5 cm will be the cost-effective option.\nThis analysis demonstrated that early EVAR for AAAs <5.5 cm is not likely to be cost-effective compared with elective repair at 5.5 cm.

    "abstract": "Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) results in significant gait impairment. In an attempt to fully delineate and quantify these gait alterations, we analyzed joint kinematics, torques (rotational forces), and powers (rotational forces times angular velocity) in patients with PAD with unilateral claudication for both the affected and nonaffected legs.\nTwelve patients with unilateral PAD (age, 61.69 +/- 10.53 years, ankle-brachial index [ABI]: affected limb 0.59 +/- 0.25; nonaffected limb 0.93 +/- 0.12) and 10 healthy controls (age, 67.23 +/- 12.67 years, ABI >1.0 all subjects) walked over a force platform to acquire gait kinetics, while joint kinematics were recorded simultaneously. Data were collected for the affected and nonaffected limbs during pain free (PAD-PF) and pain induced (PAD-P) trials. Kinetics and kinematics were combined to quantify torque and powers during the stance period from the hip, knee, and ankle joints.\nThe affected limb demonstrated significantly (P <.05) reduced ankle plantar flexion torque compared to controls during late stance in both PAD-PF and PAD-P trials. There were significant reductions in ankle plantar flexion power generation during late stance for both the affected (P <.05) and nonaffected limbs (P <.05) compared to control during PAD-PF and PAD-P trials. No significant differences were noted in torque comparing the nonaffected limbs in PAD-PF and PAD-P conditions to control for knee and hip joints throughout the stance phase. Significant reductions were found in knee power absorption in early stance and knee power generation during mid stance for both limbs of the patients with PAD as compared to control (P <.05).\nPatients with PAD with unilateral claudication demonstrate significant gait impairments in both limbs that are present even before they experience any claudication symptoms. Overall, our data demonstrate significantly reduced ankle plantar flexion torque and power during late stance with reduced knee power during early and mid stance for the affected limb. Further studies are needed to determine if these findings are dependent on the location and the severity of lower extremity ischemia and whether the changes in the nonaffected limb are the result of underlying PAD or compensatory changes from the affected limb dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the effects of strength training (ST) in walking capacity in patients with intermittent claudication (IC) compared with walking training (WT) effects.\nThirty patients with IC were randomized into ST and WT. Both groups trained twice a week for 12 weeks at the same rate of perceived exertion. ST consisted of three sets of 10 repetitions of whole body exercises. WT consisted of 15 bouts of 2-minute walking. Before and after the training program walking capacity, peak VO(2), VO(2) at the first stage of treadmill test, ankle brachial index, ischemic window, and knee extension strength were measured.\nST improved initial claudication distance (358 +/- 224 vs 504 +/- 276 meters; P < .01), total walking distance (618 +/- 282 to 775 +/- 334 meters; P < .01), VO(2) at the first stage of treadmill test (9.7 +/- 2.6 vs 8.1 +/- 1.7 mL.kg(-1).minute; P < .01), ischemic window (0.81 +/- 1.16 vs 0.43 +/- 0.47 mm Hg minute meters(-1); P = .04), and knee extension strength (19 +/- 9 vs 21 +/- 8 kg and 21 +/- 9 vs 23 +/- 9; P < .01). Strength increases correlated with the increase in initial claudication distance (r = 0.64; P = .01) and with the decrease in VO(2) measured at the first stage of the treadmill test (r = -0.52; P = .04 and r = -0.55; P = .03). Adaptations following ST were similar to the ones observed after WT; however, patients reported lower pain during ST than WT (P < .01).\nST improves functional limitation similarly to WT but it produces lower pain, suggesting that this type of exercise could be useful and should be considered in patients with IC.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) has been increasingly utilized. Early outcomes compare favorably with open mesenteric bypass--the current gold standard. The goal of this study is documentation of intermediate-term anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular mesenteric revascularization for symptomatic CMI.\nThis is a retrospective review of all patients undergoing endovascular treatment of symptomatic CMI from July 2002 to March 2008. Study endpoints included periprocedural mortality, major morbidity, patency, symptomatic recurrence, and survival. Endpoints were analyzed using actuarial methods.\nSixty-six mesenteric arteries (78.8% stenotic/21.2% occluded) were treated in 49 patients. One or more vessels were treated in each case; however, four mesenteric artery total occlusions (3 SMAs/1 IMA) could not be crossed. Initial symptom relief was noted in 89.8% (n = 44) with no change in 5 patients. Single-vessel treatments were performed in 32 patients (65.3%) and two-vessel interventions in 17 (34.7%). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.0% (n = 1). Major complications occurred in 8 patients (16.3%). The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 +/- 2.98 months (range, 0-66). Restenosis on follow-up imaging occurred in 64.9% (n = 24) of the 37 patients who had radiographic surveillance at a mean follow-up interval of 8.5 +/- 1.9 months and was diagnosed most often by Duplex scan or computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Fourteen patients (28.6%) developed recurrent symptoms with 13 requiring a reintervention. Actuarial 36-month freedom from symptomatic recurrence was 60.9% +/- 9.4%. Two-vessel treatment was protective against symptom recurrence (P = .0014) and reintervention (P = .0060) by univariate analysis. A total of 19 reinterventions were required in 14 patients (28.6%) at a mean of 17 months from the original treatment. Primary patency at 36 months was 63.9 +/- 8.5%. Actuarial survival at 48 months was 81.1% +/- 6.1% with no CMI-related deaths in the study cohort.\nIntermediate (3-year) follow-up indicates that significant restenosis and symptom recurrence are common following the endovascular treatment of symptomatic CMI. Thirty percent of the cohort required a reintervention, one-third of which were conversions to surgical reconstruction. Similar to the surgical paradigm of two-vessel revascularization, endovascular treatment of multiple mesenteric arteries produced better outcomes. A first-line endovascular approach to patients with CMI is a reasonable clinical strategy, but close follow-up is mandatory.",

The endograft infection was managed in a two-stage fashion. During the initial stage, the patient underwent an ascending-to-descending thoracic aortic bypass. Neither cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermic circulatory arrest, nor aortic cross-clamping were used. During the same hospitalization, the patient underwent successful endograft explantation through a left thoracotomy. Imaging at 6 months demonstrated no anastomotic concerns and resolution of residual pulmonary inflammation.

The patient was initially diagnosed with a retroperitoneal sarcoma that may have involved the right renal vessels and the IVC. The Vascular Surgery Service was consulted intra-operatively when it became evident that the IVC was primarily involved. The patient was treated with total en-bloc excision of the infrarenal IVC tumor with concomitant interposition polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft caval replacement. The second patient was a 58-year-old female who presented with general malaise and anemia. This tumor began in the distal infrarenal IVC and extended cephalad to the suprahepatic IVC, ending approximately 2 cm below the right atrium. Intrapericardial IVC clamping was required for cephalad control in this patient, who was then treated with excision of the tumor and concomitant interposition PTFE graft caval replacement with reimplantation of the right renal vein. A review of this rare tumor is presented.",

    "abstract": "The practice of vascular surgery is under pressure from various specialties and payers. Our group started office-based procedures in May 2007. This article reports our study of the effect of this change on our case volume, office revenue, and the financial impact on the health care system.\nBetween May 1, 2006, and April 30, 2007 (period 1), and between June 1, 2007, and May 31 2008 (period 2), 3041 and 3351 cases, respectively, were performed. In period 1, only venous cases could be done in the office. Before arteriogram, serum levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine were obtained. The number of percutaneous cases done in the hospital and office setting was analyzed, and revenue was calculated based on the 2008 Medicare fee schedule for our region. Amputation and mortality rates at 30 days were documented. Hospital DRG payment schedule was obtained.\nIn period 1, 670 (22% of total) percutaneous procedures were performed compared with 1502 (44.8%) in period 2, a twofold increase. In period 1, 1.5% of total cases were done in the office compared with 31% in period 2. There was a fivefold increase in revenue from these procedures. No deaths or amputations occurred as a result of procedures performed in the office. No anesthesiologist's expense and minimal preprocedural expenses were incurred. Total payment by Medicare, DRG payment to the hospital, and the physician component were higher in all the cases.\nA vascular surgery practice can benefit from office-based procedures. Procedures can be done safely. It results in an increase in the number of percutaneous procedures and revenue with a significant savings to the health care system. Surgeons can control their schedule. Every vascular surgeon should consider doing these procedures in office.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia remains a serious complication after surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective efficacy of fasudil, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, by reducing the number of infiltrating cells in the ventral horn and increasing the induction of eNOS against ischemic spinal cord injury in rabbits.\nEighteen Japanese white rabbits were divided into three groups: saline (group 1, n = 7, 4 degrees C) and fasudil (group 2, n = 6, 4 degrees C) were immediately infused into the isolated segmental lumbar arteries over 30 seconds after aortic clamping. Group 3 (n = 5) was the sham-operated group. Hind limb function was evaluated 4 and 8 hours, and 1 and 2 days after 15 minutes of transient ischemia. Cell damage was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and temporal profiles of endothelial nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity were performed. The number of intact motor neuron cells and infiltrating cells in the ventral horn were compared.\nTwo days after reperfusion, group 2 and group 3 showed better neurologic function, a greater number of intact motor neuron cells, and a smaller number of infiltrating cells in the ventral horn than group 1. The induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was prolonged up to 2 days after reperfusion in group 2.\nThese results indicate that fasudil has neuroprotective effects against ischemic spinal cord injury in rabbits by reducing the number of infiltrating cells in the ventral horn and prolonging the expression of eNOS.",

    "abstract": "This study reviewed the outcomes of open and endovascular revascularization for mesenteric vasculitis (MV).\nWe reviewed the clinical data of all patients who underwent revascularization for occlusive MV from 1984 to 2008. Patients treated for aneurysms or mucosal bleeding without ischemic symptoms were excluded. End points were early mortality and morbidity, survival, freedom from mesenteric symptoms, and patency. Outcomes of open reconstructions were compared with the results of 163 patients who underwent open operations for atherosclerotic disease.\nThere were 15 patients (13 females, 2 males) with a mean age of 38 years (range, 15-66 years). Etiologies were Takayasu's arteritis in 7, polyarteritis nodosa in 4, indeterminate in 3, and giant cell arteritis in 1. The celiac axis was affected in 13, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in 13, renal arteries in 8, and the aorta in 4. Seven patients had active disease, and eight were in remission. Nine (60%) presented with symptomatic chronic (n = 8) and acute (n = 1) mesenteric ischemia. Six patients with asymptomatic disease underwent mesenteric revascularization during other aortic-based operations. Fourteen patients (93%) had 10 mesenteric bypasses (8 aortic based; 2 iliac), three had aortoplasties, of which two had mesenteric patch angioplasties, and one underwent arcuate ligament release with patch angioplasty. One patient (7%) underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of SMA stenosis. There were no early deaths. Early complications occurred in three patients (20%) after open reconstruction, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, ileus with re-exploration, and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Median follow-up was 22 months. One graft thrombosis in a patient with active disease was treated with redo bypass 74 months after aorta-celiac-SMA bypass. All patients were alive at 10 years, with similar expected survival compared with the general population (P = .69). Compared with patients with atherosclerotic disease, open reconstructions for MV had similar freedom from mesenteric symptoms (83% vs 75%, P = .80) and similar primary graft patency (83% vs 84%, P = .9).\nMesenteric vasculitis is a rare manifestation of Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, indeterminate, or giant cell arteritis.

    "abstract": "Lower extremity arterial revascularization (LEAR) is the gold-standard for critical lower limb ischemia (CLI). The goal of this study was twofold. First, we evaluated the long-term functional status of patients undergoing primary LEAR for CLI. Second, prognostic factors of long-term functional status and survival after primary LEAR for CLI were assessed.\nAll primary LEAR procedures were analyzed. Patients were stratified by preoperative functional status: ambulatory (group I) vs nonambulatory (group II). Patients were followed-up after 3 and 6 years. Adverse events (AEs) were categorized according to predefined standards: minor, surgical, failed revascularization, and systemic. Associated patient demographic/clinical data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods.\nThere were 106 LEAR patients (group I: n = 42, 40% vs group II: n = 64, 60%). Group II patients were significantly older (75 vs 62 years; P = .00), were classified ASA 3-4 more frequently (78% vs 52%; P < .02), had more cardiac disease (n = 42, 66% vs n = 10, 24%; P = .00), renal disease (n = 26, 41% vs n = 7, 17%; P = .00), diabetes (n = 36, 56% vs n = 8, 19%; P = .00), hypertension (n = 47, 73% vs n = 13, 31%; P = .00) and severe CLI (n = 42, 66% vs n = 18, 38%; P < .01). Group II patients had a higher incidence of death (65.6% vs 14.3%; P = .00), minor AEs (n = 38, 26% vs n = 10, 22%; P = .00), surgical AEs (n = 48, 33% vs n = 12, 26%; P < .02) and systemic AEs (n = 24, 86% vs n = 4, 9%; P < .02). Also more unplanned reinterventions occurred in group II (n = 148, 76% vs n = 47, 24%; P = .00). Nonambulatory status was a multivariate independent predictor of nonambulatory status after LEAR during 6 years follow-up (odds ration [OR[: 21.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.76-166.77; P = .00). Pulmonary disease (OR: 7.49; 95% CI: 2.17-25.80; P = .00), not prescribing beta-blockers (OR: 4.67; 95% CI: 1.28-17.03; P < .02), nonambulatory status (OR: 22.99; 95% CI: 6.27-84.24; P = .00), and systemic AEs (OR: 9.66; 95% CI: 1.84-50.57; P < .01) were independent predictors of death. Functional status was not improved in group II after long-term follow-up.\nNonambulatory patients suffer from extensive comorbid conditions. They are accompanied with an increased occurrence of AEs, unplanned reinterventions, and poor long-term survival rates. Successful LEAR did not improve their functional status after 6 years. This emphasizes that attempts for limb salvage must be carefully considered in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Infrainguinal surgical bypass (BPG) is a durable method for lower extremity revascularization, but is accompanied by significant 30-day morbidity and mortality (MM). The goal of this study is to relate preoperative functional status, a defined metric in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, to perioperative MM.\nBetween January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007, all patients who underwent BPG from the NSQIP private sector database were reviewed. The primary end-point was 30-day MM. Patients were stratified by preoperative functional status: independent (IND) vs dependent (DEP). Associated patient demographic/clinical data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Composite odds ratios were constructed with clusters of high-risk comorbidities.\nThere were 5639 BPG patients (4600 [81.6%] IND and 1039 [18.4%]) DEP. DEP patients were significantly older (71.6 +/- 11.8 vs 66.8 +/- 11.8 years; P < .0001), had more chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (16.7% vs 11.4%; P < .0001), diabetes (54.2% vs 40.7%; P < .0001), dialysis dependence (16.4% vs 5.6%; P < .0001), and critical limb ischemia (64.6% vs 44.0%; P < .0001). DEP patients had a higher incidence of death (6.1% vs 1.5%; P < .0001) and major complications (30.3% vs 14.2%; P < .0001). DEP was an independent predictor of major complications (odds ratio [OR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.7-2.4]; P < .0001) major systemic complications (2.5 [1.9-3.2]; P < .0001), major operative site complications (1.6 [1.4-1.9]; P < .0001) and death (2.3[1.6-3.4]; P < .0001). The combination of DEP with emergency surgery, Cr > 1.8, or rest pain increased the odds of major complications by five, seven, or 11-fold, respectively. The combination of DEP with hemodialysis, emergency surgery, or age > or = 80 years increased the odds of death by 13, 38, or 87-fold, respectively.\nPreoperative DEP is significantly correlated with all adverse 30-day outcomes in BPG patients. Furthermore, when combined in high-risk composites with specific preoperative clinical variables, DEP is associated with prohibitive MM, thereby identifying patient cohorts that may be unsuitable for BPG.",

    "abstract": "Although the association between vulnerable lesions and cardiovascular events is well established, little is known about their relationship to postsurgery restenosis. To address this issue, we initiated a prospective, nonrandomized study to examine the femoral plaques on both sides in patients who were undergoing eversion carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and were longitudinally followed-up for early restenosis development.\nThe final analysis enrolled 321 patients (189 women) with a median age of 67.0 years (interquartile range, 59.0-73.0 years), who underwent eversion CEA (2005 to 2007). Using duplex ultrasound scanning, we evaluated 321 common femoral atherosclerotic lesions on the day before CEA. A quantitative scale was used to grade the size of plaques as grade 1, one or more small plaques (<20 mm2); grade 2, moderate to large plaques; and grade 3, plaques giving flow disturbances. The plaque morphology in terms of echogenicity was graded as echolucent, 1; predominantly echolucent, 2; predominantly echogenic, 3; echogenic 4; or calcified, 5. The plaque surface was categorized as smooth, irregular, or ulcerated. The patients underwent carotid duplex ultrasound imaging at 6 weeks and at 6, 12, and 24 months after CEA. Mann-Whitney U test, chi2 test, and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical evaluation.\nInternal carotid artery restenosis of > or = 50% was detected in 33 patients (10.28%) in the operated region. Neither the size (grade 1, P = .793; grade 2, P = .540; grade 3, P = .395) nor the surface characteristics of the femoral plaques (smooth, P = .278; irregular, P = .281; ulcerated, P = .934) were significantly different between the patients with and without carotid restenosis. Echolucent-predominantly echolucent femoral lesions were an independent predictor of recurrent carotid stenosis (adjusted odds ratio, 5.63; 95% confidence interval, 2.14-10.89; P < .001).\nUltrasound evaluation of femoral plaque morphology before CEA can be useful for identifying patients at higher risk for carotid restenosis.",

The aim of this retrospective study is to report a standardized surgical technique of ICA reconstruction with long-term results.\nBetween 1988 and 2005, 13 patients (11 men; age 18 to 76 years, mean 42.6 years) underwent lateral skull base approach with cervical-to-petrous carotid artery bypass for repair of ICA aneurysms. Principal elements of the technique were: partial resection of the parotid gland without rerouting of the facial nerve; luxation of mandibula; drilling of the bone.\nThe 13 patients had unilateral aneurysm of the ICA at the base of the skull. Four aneurysms were of atherosclerotic origin; six fibromuscular dysplasia; two post-traumatic; one cause was undetermined. The mean diameter of the aneurysms was 12 mm (range, 7-21 mm). Twelve patients were symptomatic: six presented neurological events (four strokes, two transient ischemic attack [TIA]); two retinal events; three compressive symptoms (two Horner's syndrome and one paralysis of the glossopharyngeal nerve); one patient presented a visible pulsatile mass in the neck. One patient was asymptomatic. There were no post-operative deaths, one TIA, 13 transient palsies of the lower facial nerve, and one transient palsy of accessory nerve. Palsy of cranial nerves was partial and disappeared within a mean of 5.6 months (range, 1-10 months). The postoperative angiogram showed patency in all but one case (one asymptomatic thrombosis). During follow-up (mean, 152 months), there was one unrelated death, one focal epileptic seizure, and one controlateral TIA. In November 2008, duplex showed patency of all 11 grafts (one death, one thrombosis). At 10 years, the survival, cumulative stroke-free survival, ipsilateral stroke-free, and patency rates was were 90.9%, 100%, 100%, and 92.3%.\nVenous graft bypass from the cervical-to-petrous ICA can be performed safely with such an approach and produces durable satisfactory results.",

    "abstract": "To analyze early and midterm results after endovascular treatment of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms (rTAA).\nBetween January 1997 and January 2009, a total of 236 patients received thoracic aortic repair in our institution; 23 patients (14 men; median age, 75 years; range, 60-88 years) due to a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm (rTAA). Rupture was defined according to computed tomography angiography (CTA) criteria with definite sign for hemorrhage outside the aortic wall. Patients with symptomatic TAA but with normal CT scans were excluded. A retrospective analysis of these patients was performed. Median follow up was 28 months (range, 0.1-82.5 months) and included serial aortic imaging at discharge, six, and 12 months and annually thereafter.\nTechnical success rate was 87%. The overall in hospital mortality was 48% with predominantly (50%) cardiac complications. Neurological complications occurred in three patients, two patients suffered from a transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke, and one patient experienced paraplegia after early conversion to open surgery. Primary endoleaks were seen in four of 25 patients (16%); no secondary endoleak was observed. Early conversion was necessary in two patients caused by an aortoesophageal fistula. The one- and three-year survival rates were 37.3% and 29.9% with no aortic or procedure-related death during follow up. Reintervention was necessary in four of 25 patients (16%). Cox regression analysis revealed preoperative renal insufficiency (hazard ratio [HR] 5.85, P = .0073) as an independent predictor of perioperative death.\nThe endovascular treatment of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms is associated with a high perioperative mortality and morbidity as well as poor midterm survival. Renal insufficiency proved to be an independent risk factor for perioperative death.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of endovascular exclusion of popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) using stent grafts.\nThe clinical data of all patients who underwent endovascular exclusion of PAA at three French vascular departments between December 1999 and December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Outcome measures included graft patency and endoleak. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the primary and secondary patency curves.\nA total of 57 PAA in 50 patients (48 men; mean age, 72 +/- 11 years; range, 57-96 years) were treated. The type of stent graft used was Hemobahn/Viabahn in 42 (73.7%) cases, Wallgraft in 14 (24.5%) and Passager in one. The mean duration of hospitalization was 5 +/- 1.8 days (range, 3-11 days). No patients were lost from follow up (mean, 36 +/- 19.4 months; range, 6-96 months). Nine (16%) occlusions and six (10.5%) endoleaks occurred. The global limb salvage rate was 96.5% (55 of 57 PAA). Kaplan-Meier estimates for primary and secondary patency were 85.8% and 87.5% at one year and 82.3% and 87.5% at three years.\nEndovascular treatment of PAA is feasible in selected patients. The main determinants of success are suitable aneurysm anatomy and dual antiplatelet postoperative therapy. Further studies are warranted to determine long-term outcomes of endovascular repair for PAA.",

    "abstract": "The intent of endovascular therapy for symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is to preserve parenchyma and avoid renal-related morbidity. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of renal artery intervention on parenchymal preservation.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent endovascular intervention for ARAS and were followed by duplex ultrasound between 1990 and 2008. Renal volume (in cm(3)) was estimated in all patients as renal length (cm) x renal width (cm) x renal depth (cm) x 0.5. The normal renal volume was calculated as 2 x body weight (kg) in cm(3). Failure of preservation was considered to be a persistent 10% decrease in volume. Clinical benefit defined as freedom from renal-related morbidity (increase in persistent creatinine >20% of baseline, progression to hemodialysis, death from renal-related causes) was calculated.\nFive hundred ninety-two renal artery interventions were performed. One hundred eighty-six kidneys suffered parenchymal loss (>5%) with an actuarial parenchymal loss rate of 29% +/- 1% at five years respectively. There were no significant differences in age, gender, starting renal volume, or kidney size. However, patients with parenchymal loss had lower eGFR (45 +/- 24 vs 53 +/- 24 mL/min/1.73 m(2); Loss vs noLoss, P = .0002, Mean +/- SD) higher resistive index (0.75 +/- 0.9 vs 0.73 +/- 0.10; P = .0001) and worse nephrosclerosis grade (1.43 +/- 0.55 vs 1.30 +/- 0.49; P = .006) then those not suffering parenchymal loss. Parenchymal loss was associated with significantly worse five-year survival (26% +/- 4% vs 48% +/- 2%; Loss vs noLoss; P < .001) and freedom from renal-related morbidity (70% +/- 5% vs 82% +/- 2%; P < .05) with increased numbers progressing to dialysis (17% vs 7%; P < .006).\nWhile parenchymal preservation occurs in most patients, parenchymal loss occurs in 31% of patients and is associated with markers of impaired parenchymal perfusion (resistive index and nephrosclerosis grade) at the time of intervention. Pre-existing renal size or volumes were not predictive of parenchymal loss. Parenchymal loss is associated with a significant decrease in survival and a marked increased renal related morbidity and progression to hemodialysis.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are important in the development of intimal hyperplasia, the major cause of vein graft failure. Proteases of the plasminogen activator (PA) system and of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system are pivotal in extracellular matrix degradation and, by that, SMC migration. Previously, we demonstrated that inhibition of both protease systems simultaneously with viral gene delivery of the hybrid protein TIMP-1.ATF, consisting of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and the receptor-binding amino terminal fragment (ATF) of urokinase, reduces SMC migration and neointima formation in an in vitro restenosis model using human saphenous vein cultures more efficiently than both protease systems separately. Because use of viral gene delivery is difficult in clinical application, this study used nonviral delivery of TIMP-1.ATF plasmid to reduce vein graft disease in a murine bypass model. Nonviral gene transfer by electroporation was used to avert major disadvantages of viral gene delivery, such as immune responses and short-term expression.\nPlasmids encoding ATF, TIMP-1, TIMP-1.ATF, or luciferase, as a control, were injected and electroporated in both calf muscles of hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E3-Leiden (APOE*3Leiden) mice (n = 8). One day after electroporation, a venous interposition of a donor mouse was placed into the carotid artery of a recipient mouse. In this model, vein graft thickening develops with features of accelerated atherosclerosis. Vein grafts were harvested 4 weeks after electroporation and surgery, and histologic analysis of the vessel wall was performed.\nElectroporation-mediated overexpression of the plasmid vectors resulted in a prolonged expression of the transgenes and resulted in a significant reduction of vein graft thickening (ATF: 36% +/- 9%, TIMP-1: 49% +/- 5%, TIMP-1.ATF: 58% +/- 5%; P < .025). Although all constructs reduced vein graft thickening compared with the controls, the luminal area was best preserved in the TIMP-1.ATF-treated mice.\nIntramuscular electroporation of TIMP-1.ATF inhibits vein graft thickening in vein grafts in carotid arteries of hypercholesterolemic mice. Binding of TIMP-1.ATF hybrid protein to the u-PA receptor at the cell surface enhances the inhibitory effect of TIMP-1 on vein graft remodeling in vitro as well as in vivo and may be an effective strategy to prevent vein graft disease.",

    "abstract": "Smoking not only increases the risk that coronary heart disease will develop but also morbidity and mortality in patients with known coronary atherosclerosis and after coronary artery bypass grafting. Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated as the final common pathway for the development of endothelial dysfunction in various cardiovascular risk factors. This study assessed the influence of smoking on two different human arteries routinely used as coronary artery bypass graft conduits.\nIsometric tension was recorded on discarded segments of human left internal thoracic artery (ITA) and the radial artery (RA) from smokers and nonsmokers.\nThe contractile response to endothelin-1 was significantly stronger in arteries from smokers than in those from nonsmokers. By contrast, endothelium-dependent relaxant responses to acetylcholine were attenuated in RA rings but enhanced in ITA rings from smokers. In additional experiments, 5-(&6)-chloromethyl-2'-7'-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCDHF) was used to photochemically detect ROS by confocal imaging of intact ITA and RA. Enhanced production of ROS was induced by exposure of tissues to 28 degrees C. While during exposure to 28 degrees C, basal fluorescence emission was unchanged in ITA rings, it increased significantly in RA rings, indicating enhanced formation of ROS in this peripheral artery.\nData suggest that smoking induces endothelial dysfunction by increasing vascular ROS production. Different levels of endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities and the degree of atherosclerotic changes might modulate physiologic and pharmacologic vasoreactivity and be responsible for decreased graft patency of RA compared with ITA conduits, especially in active smokers.",

The next day her clot had resolved, and a culprit left iliac vein stenosis was identified. After stent placement, a heparin infusion was initiated and the patient was taken back to the ward. At 11 the evening after the procedure, the resident on call was contacted to verify the written order. The resident stated that the heparin dose was to be 250 U/h; however, the nurse documented 2500 U/h and changed the infusion pump at the patient's bedside. At 5:30 the next morning, the resident was notified that the patient's partial thromboplastin time was >300 seconds and promptly shut off the heparin infusion. No noticeable adverse events occurred because of the high heparin dosing. The charge nurse was notified, as was risk management. What should the patient be told?",

    "abstract": "The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) has largely added benefit to the percutaneous coronary intervention. Questions about the long-term safety of DES have been raised, however, particularly with respect to late stent thrombosis. Research efforts are now being directed toward therapeutics that can impede smooth muscle proliferation and promote vascular healing. Emerging data suggest that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible oxidoreductase enzyme system, can exert cytoprotective effects on endothelial cells and limit smooth muscle cell proliferation. We assessed the ability of hemin, a potent HO-1 inducer, to reduce in-stent stenosis without compromising re-endothelialization.\nRat aorta and rabbit iliac arteries were stented. Animals received ongoing treated with intraperitoneal hemin (50 mg/kg) or vehicle. At 7 to 28 days after surgery, stented arterial segments were collected and processed for histologic, electron microscopy, or protein analysis.\nIn both models, treatment with hemin reduced neointima growth without compromising re-endothelialization of the stented arteries. In the rat aorta, analysis of protein expression at 7 and 28 days after stenting revealed that hemin increased HO-1 expression and limited the early inflammatory, apoptotic, and proliferative cellular events that are common to in-stent stenosis. Hemin treatment decreased the expression of the Ki-67 protein and the activity of key regulators of smooth muscle cell proliferation, including p42/44, RhoA, and up-regulated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The beneficial effects of hemin were abolished in the presence of tin-protoporphyrin IX, an HO inhibitor. Finally, treatment with tricarbonylchloro(glycinato)ruthenium(II), a carbon monoxide donor, reduced in-stent stenosis in the rat aorta, suggesting that carbon monoxide, a by-product of heme degradation, might contribute to the protective effect of hemin.\nThese results suggest that HO-1 is important in limiting in-stent stenosis and can be regarded as a new therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative beta-blocker therapy has been a heavily investigated and controversial topic during the past decade. Prior national consensus statements that recommended the routine use of these medications in patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures have been called into question because of the results of recent clinical trials that involved heterogeneous groups of surgical patients. This article reviews the evidence for perioperative beta-blocker usage as it pertains to patients undergoing vascular surgery procedures. The weight of evidence suggests that beta-blockers lower the perioperative risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction and cardiovascular death among patients with clinical risk factors undergoing major vascular surgery. However, there appears to be a concurrent risk of adverse events associated with these medications if patients are not monitored properly during the perioperative period. Perioperative beta-blockers should continue to occupy a prominent role in the therapeutic armamentarium for improving outcomes among high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "The 0 + 5 integrated vascular surgery (VS) residency has altered the training paradigm for future vascular specialists. Rising interest in these novel programs highlights our need to better understand the applicant pool. We compared demographics and surveyed recent applicants to our integrated program to gain more insight into their background and motivation for accelerated vascular training.\nDemographics and objective parameters were determined from all 65 applicants to the integrated VS program at Stanford University Medical Center and compared to 58 applicants interviewed by the general surgery (GS) program at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center by querying the Electronic Residency Application System for the programs in 2009. There was no overlap of applicants between programs. An anonymous, voluntary Web-based survey was sent to these cohorts with a response rate of 82% for VS applicants and 60% for GS applicants. Subjects were queried regarding their background, personal experience, prior exposure to VS, and motivations for residency specialty selection.\nApplicants to integrated VS programs tended to be older, were less likely to be from a US medical school, had a higher number of publications, and a higher percentage of cardiovascular-related publications than the GS applicants. When stratified by the 27 VS applicants (41%) that were offered an interview, this highly selected and desirable group for training was nearly 40% female, more likely to have an additional degree (PhD, master's), just as likely to be in the top quartile of their medical school class (60%), and score equally well on standardized board examinations (90th percentile) than the top GS applicants offered interviews. Survey data revealed that the majority of career choices (65%) were made during the third and fourth years of medical school. Factors most strongly influencing the decision to choose VS as a career were endovascular technologies/devices, challenging open vascular operations, clinical rotations on vascular surgery, the aging patient population, and perceived need for vascular surgeons and vascular surgeon mentorship. The most common reasons cited for particularly pursuing an integrated 0 + 5 VS training program were (1) more focused training/integration of cardiovascular medicine, (2) interest in catheter-based endovascular therapies, and (3) shorter time in training. Of the GS applicants, 58% indicated they would be interested in applying to an integrated residency in their subspecialty of interest, and 45% listed vascular surgery as a potential fellowship option after general surgery.\nApplicants to 0 + 5 integrated vascular residencies were more likely to have rotated on a vascular surgery service, observed vascular cases, identified a vascular surgery mentor, and been actively involved in cardiovascular research. The quality of the top VS applicant based on class rank and test scores is comparable to the top GS applicants, yet the VS applicant has a higher percentage of advanced degrees, more publications, and more involvement in cardiovascular research. Institutional strategies to increase medical student exposure to vascular surgery clinically and via research programs will optimize our ability to attract and train the best candidates in these new training programs.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) has largely focused on reflux. Minimally-invasive techniques to address superficial and perforator reflux have evolved, but correction of deep reflux continues to be challenging. The advent of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) scan and minimally invasive venous stent technology have renewed interest in the obstructive component in CVI pathophysiology. The aim of this study is to assess stent-related and clinical outcomes following treatment by iliac venous stenting alone in limbs with a combination of iliac vein obstruction and deep venous reflux.\nA total of 528 limbs in 504 patients, ranging in age from 15 to 87, underwent IVUS-guided iliac vein stent placement to correct obstruction over an 11-year period. The etiology of obstruction was nonthrombotic in 196 (37%), post-thrombotic in 285 (54%) limbs, and combined in 47 (9%). Clinical severity class of CEAP was C3 in 44%, C(4,5) in 27%, and C6 in 25% of stented limbs. Deep venous reflux was present in all limbs, associated with superficial and/or perforator reflux in 69%. Reflux was severe in 309/528 (59%) limbs (reflux multisegment score > or = 3) and 224/528 (42%) limbs had axial reflux. Venography and other functional tests had poor diagnostic sensitivity to detect obstruction, which was ultimately diagnosed by IVUS. The IVUS-guided iliac vein stenting was the only procedure performed and the associated reflux was left uncorrected.\nThere was no mortality; morbidity was minor. Cumulative secondary stent patency was 88% at 5 years; no stent occlusions occurred in nonthrombotic limbs. Cumulative rates of limbs with healed active ulcers, freedom of ulcer recurrence in legs with healed ulcers (C5), and freedom from leg dermatitis at 5 years were 54%, 88%, and 81%, respectively. Cumulative rate of substantial improvement of pain and swelling at 5 years was 78% and 55%, respectively. Quality of life improved significantly. Reflux parameters did not deteriorate after stenting.\nIliac venous stenting alone is sufficient to control symptoms in the majority of patients with combined outflow obstruction and deep reflux. Partial correction of the pathophysiology in limbs with multisystem or multilevel disease can provide substantial symptom relief. Percutaneous stent technology in concert with other minimally-invasive techniques to address superficial and/or perforator reflux offers such partial correction in limbs with advanced CVI and complex venous pathology. Open correction of obstruction or reflux is now required only infrequently as a \"last resort\".",

    "abstract": "Extracranial carotid stenoses exhibit significant variance in embolic potential, with restenotic lesions having a particularly low propensity for embolization. This study sought to identify characteristics associated with increased generation of embolic debris during carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS).\nCaptured particulate was available for analysis in 56 consecutive patients. Demographics were mean age, 74 years (range, 60-94 years); mean stenosis, 88% (range, 70%-99%); symptomatic, 27%; prior carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 27%; prior radiotherapy, 7%. Plaque echogenicity, heterogenicity, ulceration, and irregularity were assessed with B-mode duplex ultrasound analysis. Gray scale median (GSM) was calculated from normalized B-mode VHS video recordings. Calcification and degree of stenosis were determined angiographically. Captured particulate debris was evaluated for total number; number >200 microm, >500 microm, >1000 microm; mean and median size. Hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and von Kossa stains were used for histologic analysis of captured material.\nRestenotic carotid stenoses after prior CEA generated minimal embolic debris compared with primary stenoses. Four of 15 patients (27%) with restenotic lesions demonstrated embolic particles; all debris was <500 microm. All 41 patients with primary stenoses had some embolic debris; particulate size was >200 microm in 91%, >500 microm in 72%, and >1000 microm in 43%. In primary lesions, the number and size of captured particulate correlated with GSM and with the combined ultrasound findings of echogenicity, heterogenicity, and luminal irregularity/ulceration (P < .02, 95% confidence interval, 4.5-27.6). None of these ultrasound factors correlated independently with embolic particulate (P = NS). Patients aged >70 years exhibited more total particles (8.1 vs 2.3, P = .008) and increased mean particle size (370 vs 157 mum, P = .02). No significant correlation was observed between the number and size of captured embolic particulate and any other variable (stenosis percentage, prior radiotherapy, preprocedural symptoms, periprocedural symptoms, and calcification). Histologically, the embolic debris consisted of extensive amorphous, acellular proteinaceous material. Calcium debris in the embolic particulate was associated with heavily and moderately calcified lesions.\nConsiderable variation exists in the number and size of embolic particles generated during CAS. Embolic potential is positively correlated with lesion GSM and the combination of lesion echogenicity, heterogenicity, and irregularity. Restenosis after prior CEA is associated with minimal embolic particulate generation, suggesting that embolic protection may not be necessary for CAS of restenotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) advised little benefit from surgery in women because of high operative risk. Whether these findings are also applicable to carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is subject of investigation. Our aim was to determine the risk of perioperative and late complications related to CAS and CEA in women.\nData from a single-center carotid surgery database including 1065 individuals with CAS (306 women and 759 men) and 1131 with CEA (325 women and 806 men) were analyzed in a consecutive series of patients. Perioperative risks of death, stroke, and local complications in women undergoing CAS and CEA were compared. Rates of restenosis >50% and stroke at 5 years in symptomatic and asymptomatic women were also assessed.\nThe perioperative risks of stroke or death were no different in women who underwent CAS and CEA women (1.9% vs 3.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-1.7; P = .45) whether they were symptomatic or not. Other perioperative complications were also similarly distributed between the two groups of women. Life-table estimates of any periprocedural stroke/death and ipsilateral stroke at 5 years after the procedure did not differ between women with CAS and CEA (4.1% vs 8.1%; P = .18). Five-year rates of restenosis >50% were nonsignificantly higher in women after CEA than after CAS (1.8% vs 8.1%; P = .058).\nWomen with carotid stenosis might have favorable early and late outcomes from CAS with complication rates similar and even lower than those attained with CEA. CAS, performed by trained operators, may be a valid primary choice for treatment of carotid stenosis, particularly in asymptomatic women for whom the risk of surgery seems to be higher. However, before claiming CAS for women, these results need to be confirmed by large RCTs.",

    "abstract": "The mortality of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) has decreased 3.5% per decade in the last 50 years to a current rate of 40%-50%. Reports have indicated that endovascular repair (EVAR) is feasible for rAAA and may offer potential benefits over open repair. We examined the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to compare 30-day multicenter outcomes for EVAR vs open rAAA repair.\nPatients that underwent rAAA repair in the NSQIP database from 2005 to 2007 were identified through a combination of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses. Preoperative comorbidities, operative duration and transfusion, and 30 day outcomes were evaluated using t tests or Chi-squared tests depending on the variable. A separate multivariable regression was performed for each outcome adjusting for all independently predictive preoperative and intraoperative risk factors.\nA total of 427 patients were identified and 76.8% of patients underwent open repair. The open repair groups exhibited lower albumin levels and higher percentage of patients with preoperative hematocrit (Hct) <38% and need for preoperative ventilation. The requirement for preoperative blood transfusion was similar. Patients undergoing open repair had much higher intraoperative transfusion requirements (11.8 +/- 8.9 vs 4.2 +/- 6.0 red blood cell units, P < .001). After adjustment for preoperative mortality risk factors, the mortality risk was higher for open repair versus EVAR (odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-3.05, P = .096) but did not reach significance. After similar adjustment the composite morbidity odds ratio for open repair versus EVAR was 1.82 (95% CI 1.11-2.99, P = .018) and the pulmonary adverse events odds ratio was 1.99 (95% CI 1.22-3.25, P = .006). Risks for the other outcomes were not significant.\nComposite 30-day morbidity risk is lower after EVAR vs open repair of rAAA. Open repair is associated with increased transfusion requirements. Performance of EVAR in rAAA patients with favorable anatomy could potentially result in improved outcome as compared with open repair.",

    "abstract": "Although technical success of renal artery stenting (RAS) is high and adverse events are infrequent, clinical success (improved blood pressure and renal function) and durability have been less predictable. Identifying those patients who will respond to RAS could improve overall outcomes of the procedure.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent RAS for treatment of renovascular hypertension (RVH) between 2001 and 2007 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The primary outcome measure was blood pressure improvement or cure as judged by American Heart Association criteria. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), number of antihypertensive medications, and survival were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with blood pressure improvement at the last follow-up.\nDuring the 6-year period, 129 patients (179 renal arteries) underwent stent placement for RVH. Procedural complications occurred nine patients (7.0%). Average length follow-up was 1.5 years. Follow-up data were obtained in 122 patients (95%). At last follow-up, there were significant improvements in systolic blood pressure (161 vs 144 mm Hg, P < .001), diastolic blood pressure (80 vs 73 mm Hg, P < .001), and number of antihypertensive medications (3.1 vs 2.8, P = .034). The eGFR was improved in 16% of patients, stable in 60%, and worse in 24%. By multivariate analysis, a baseline eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.9; P = .02) and female gender (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P = .04) were independent predictors of failure to achieve blood pressure improvement. By 2 and 4 years of follow-up, sustained blood pressure improvement was present in 67% of patients with a baseline eGFR of > or = 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 and in 31% of patients with a baseline eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2. During 2 years of follow-up, survival was similar between patients with sustained blood pressure response and those without.\nPatients treated for RVH who have a baseline eGFR of > or = 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 demonstrate a better response to RAS at each follow-up interval, with a significant difference at 2 to 4 years, compared with patients with an eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2.",

Average length follow-up was 1.5 years. Follow-up data were obtained in 122 patients (95%). At last follow-up, there were significant improvements in systolic blood pressure (161 vs 144 mm Hg, P < .001), diastolic blood pressure (80 vs 73 mm Hg, P < .001), and number of antihypertensive medications (3.1 vs 2.8, P = .034). The eGFR was improved in 16% of patients, stable in 60%, and worse in 24%. By multivariate analysis, a baseline eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.9; P = .02) and female gender (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P = .04) were independent predictors of failure to achieve blood pressure improvement. By 2 and 4 years of follow-up, sustained blood pressure improvement was present in 67% of patients with a baseline eGFR of > or = 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 and in 31% of patients with a baseline eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2. During 2 years of follow-up, survival was similar between patients with sustained blood pressure response and those without.",

    "abstract": "Open revascularization in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is considered the gold standard. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) is often reserved for patients not suitable for open revascularization. In our institute, endovascular revascularization is the first-choice treatment. The purpose of this study was to report the technical and clinical success rates after endovascular revascularization as the first-choice treatment in a series of 51 consecutive patients with CMI at a single tertiary vascular referral center.\nA retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients with CMI who underwent PTAS from July 2001 to July 2008. Only symptomatic patients treated for atherosclerotic CMI were included. Patency was evaluated using computed tomography angiography (CTA). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate patency rates of the treated mesenteric arteries.\nSixty mesenteric arteries (30 celiac trunks, 24 superior mesenteric, and 6 inferior mesenteric arteries) were treated in 51 patients (26 men). Major morbidity was 4%. After dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (n = 1) and brachial artery (n = 1), respectively, both patients underwent endarterectomy and patch plasty. In three arteries, the lesion could not be crossed endovascularly and they were deemed immediate intention-to-treat failures. The initial technical success rate was 93%. No 30-day mortality was observed. Median follow-up was 25 months. During follow-up, 2 patients died from intestinal ischemia. Complete symptom relief was achieved in 78% of patients. Primary 1- and 2-year patency rates were 86% +/- 5% and 60% +/- 9%, respectively; primary-assisted patency rates were 88% +/- 5% and 79% +/- 7%, respectively. During follow-up, 6 patients underwent open revascularization due to failure of PTAS.\nThe initial technical success rate of PTAS as first-choice treatment of CMI is >90%. The 2-year primary patency rate dropped to 60%, but symptomatic in-stent stenoses could often be treated successfully with renewed endovascular techniques.

The main outcomes examined were in-hospital death and stroke, adjusted for age, gender, symptomatic status, and for comorbid disease.\nCarotid endarterectomy was performed for 20,022 patients. Strokes occurred in 189 patients (0.94%), and death occurred in 59 (0.29%).

    "abstract": "To compare the proportion and rate of healing, pain, and quality of life of low-strength medical compression stockings (MCS) with traditional bandages applied for the treatment of recalcitrant venous leg ulcers.\nA single-center, randomized, open-label study was performed with consecutive patients. Sigvaris prototype MCS providing 15 mm Hg-25 mm Hg at the ankle were compared with multi-layer short-stretch bandages. In both groups, pads were placed above incompetent perforating veins in the ulcer area. The initial static pressure between the dressing-covered ulcer and the pad was 29 mm Hg and 49 mm Hg with MCS and bandages, respectively. Dynamic pressure measurements showed no difference. Compression was maintained day and night and changed every week. The primary endpoint was healing within 90 days. Secondary endpoints were healing within 180 days, time to healing, pain (weekly Likert scales), and monthly quality of life (ChronIc Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life [CIVIQ] questionnaire).\nOf 74 patients screened, 60 fulfilled the selection criteria and 55 completed the study; 28 in the MCS and 27 in the bandage group. Ulcers were recurrent (48%), long lasting (mean, 27 months), and large (mean, 13 cm2). All but one patient had deep venous reflux and/or incompetent perforating veins in addition to trunk varices. Characteristics of patients and ulcers were evenly distributed (exception: more edema in the MCS group; P = .019). Healing within 90 days was observed in 36% with MCS and in 48% with bandages (P = .350). Healing within 180 days was documented in 50% with MCS and in 67% with bandages (P = .210). Time to healing was identical. Pain scored 44 and 46 initially (on a scale in which 100 referred to maximum and 0 to no pain) and decreased within the first week to 20 and 28 in the MCS and bandage groups, respectively (P < .001 vs .010). Quality of life showed no difference between the treatment groups. In both groups, pain at 90 days had decreased by half, independent of completion of healing.

    "abstract": "Open repair of acute traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta has been the standard of care for the past half century. Traditional criteria of operative success have been patient survival and prevention of spinal cord ischemia. Historical series have reported a variability of surgical results with relation to the variety of operative approaches. This study aims to update the results obtained with a uniform surgical technique based on a systematic utilization of distal perfusion during aortic cross-clamping.\nDuring a 35-year period (1974-2009), 138 consecutive patients with an acute traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta were repaired with a Dacron graft interposition through a standard left thoracotomy. All patients received a method of circulatory support. A passive 9-mm Gott shunt inserted between the ascending and the descending aorta and delivering a median flow of 3 L/min was used in the first 40 cases. A partial left heart bypass realized from the left atrium to the descending aorta and driven with a centrifugal pump was used in the last 98 consecutive cases. A median flow of 4 L/min was recorded. Mean age of the patients was 27 years and 90.6% of them had associated injuries for a calculated mean ISS of 44.\nTwo outcome variables were analyzed: hospital mortality and postoperative spinal cord ischemic injury. Overall hospital mortality is 5% (7/138 patients). This was improved from 7.5% (3/40) in patients perfused with the Gott shunt to 4% (4/98) in patients protected with the left heart bypass and lowered to 1.5% (1/68) in the last 68 patients. Among 134 cases with an intact preoperative spinal cord, one patient (0.7%) developed a new paraplegia due to a nonfunctional Gott shunt. Among 98 patients perfused with a centrifugal pump-driven left heart bypass, none of the 97 patients (0%) with a preoperative intact spinal cord developed a spinal cord ischemic deficit.\nConventional open surgical repair of acute traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta performed with an orderly monitored circulatory support can be accomplished with a very low rate of mortality and spinal cord injury. Compared with the Gott shunt, a left heart bypass propelled with a centrifugal pump is technically a more versatile method of perfusion, and it provides higher hemodynamic performance.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing repair of thoracoabdominal (TAA) or visceral aortic segment aneurysms typically require reconstruction of the renal arteries. The use of balloon expandable stents (BES) has been proposed as an alternative to endarterectomy or bypass for renal artery reconstruction (RAR) during open aortic aneurysm repair. We report technical aspects and long-term patency data for this method of right RAR during complex open aortic aneurysm repair.\nDuring the interval July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007, a total of 67 patients underwent right RAR using a BES during concomitant TAA (type I: n = 2 [2.9%], type II: n = 8 [11.9%], type III: n = 13 [19.4%], and type IV: n = 22 [32.8%]), juxtarenal (n = 9 [13.4%]) or suprarenal (n = 13 [19.4%]) AAA repair. Indications for RAR were orificial stenosis (n = 21 [31%]) and/or technical considerations referable to the proximal aortic suture line. Patency of the renal stent was evaluated in patients with computed tomography angiography using three-dimensional reconstruction or with abdominal duplex evaluation at follow-up.\nThe mean patient age was 75.1 years, 54.4% were male, and 18% of operations were in nonelective circumstances. Twenty-seven (39%) out of 67 patients had a preoperative creatinine level > or = 1.4 mg/dL. Two patients (2.9%) developed permanent renal failure postoperatively (neither related to renal artery occlusion). Mean radiologic follow-up was 405 days (11-1281) with 98% stent patency noted. One patient had an early stent occlusion noted at 1 month. An additional patient was noted to have a nonflow-limiting dissection distal to the renal stent, and another was noted to have distal migration of the stent beyond the renal ostium; however, these findings were clinically silent.\nThe use of BES during complex open aortic aneurysm repair affords a rapid and durable mode of RAR, obviating the need for endarterectomy and its associated technical complications.",

Definitive management consisted of popliteal vein aneurysm resection and reconstruction with an interposition spiral vein graft. Our case suggests that aneurysm vein resection and interposition vein graft should be the preferred surgical option. Also, patients treated may benefit from longer follow-up in light of the potential morbidity from recurrence if undetected.",

    "abstract": "Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy without muscle flap coverage is our primary approach for graft preservation in early, deep groin infections with and without exposed grafts; however, concerns exist regarding its safety. We report our experience in a consecutive series of patients with early groin infections managed without muscle flap closure.\nAll patients with early (<30 day), deep vascular groin infections without (Szilagyi II) or with (Szilagyi III) exposed vascular graft or suture line between January 2004 and December 2008 were reviewed. Graft preservation followed by local wound care with VAC was attempted in all with intact anastomoses, patent grafts, and absence of systemic sepsis. Szilagyi classification, microorganism cultured, duration of VAC use, time to healing, additional interventions, and follow-up data (limb salvage, survival) were analyzed.\nTwenty-two patients (26 groins, mean age 69.1 +/- 9.5 years [range, 44-86 years]) presented with deep groin infections 16 +/- 5 days (range, 7-28 days) after the index procedure (bypass-polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 11], autologous vein [n = 3], endarterectomy/patch [n = 6], extra-anatomic bypass [n = 5], percutaneous closure device [n = 1]). Grafts were exposed in 12 groins (Szilagyi III, nine with suture lines). VAC was started one to six days (median, three) after operative debridement. All had positive wound cultures and received culture-directed antibiotic therapy for 47 +/- 45 days (range, 14-180 days). Length of stay was significantly more in Szilagyi III, whereas mean VAC use and time-to-healing were similar. Mean follow-up was 33.4 +/- 19.5 months (range, 2-72 months). All wounds healed (mean, 49 +/- 21 days). Two treatment failures occurred in the Szilagyi III group (17%). One patient had bleeding from the anastomotic heel eight days after debridement, had graft removal/in situ replacement and one presented with reinfection on day 117 and had partial graft removal/extra-anatomic bypass. There was no perioperative mortality or limb loss, but six late unrelated mortalities and one amputation at 46 months unrelated to the groin infection.\nManagement of early, deep groin wound infections with debridement, antibiotics, and VAC treatment is safe and enables graft preservation in the majority of patients with minimal morbidity, no perioperative limb loss, or mortality.",

    "abstract": "The Vascular Registry (VR) on carotid procedures collects long-term outcomes on carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) patients. The purpose of this report is to describe in-hospital and 30-day CAS outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic carotid artery disease (CAD; atherosclerosis [ATH]) compared to recurrent carotid stenosis (RES) and radiation-induced stenosis (RAD).\nThe VR collects provider-reported data on CAS using a Web-based data management system. For this report, data were analyzed at the preprocedure, procedure, predischarge, and 30-day intervals.\nAs of November 20, 2008, there were 4017 patients with CAS with discharge data, of which 72% were due to ATH. A total of 2321 patients were available for 30-day outcomes analysis (1623 ATH, 529 restenosis, 119 radiation, 17 dissection, 3 trauma, and 30 other). Baseline demographics showed that ATH occurred in older patients (72-years-old), had the greatest history of coronary artery disease (CAD; 62%), myocardial infarction (MI; 24%), valvular heart disease (8%), arrhythmia (16%), congestive heart failure (CHF; 16%), diabetes mellitus (DM; 35%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 20%). RES had a higher degree of baseline stenosis (87.0 vs 85.8 ATH; P = .010), were less likely to be symptomatic (35.5% vs 46.3% ATH; P < .001), but had a greater history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and smoking. RAD was seen in younger patients (66.6 vs 71.7 ATH; P < .001), were more likely to be male (78.2% vs 60.9% ATH; P < .001), and had less comorbidities overall, with the exception of amaurosis fugax, smoking, and cancer. The only statistically significant difference in perioperative rates was in transient ischemic attack (TIA; 2.7% ATH vs 0.9% RES; P = .02). There were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital death/stroke/MI (ATH 5.4%, RES 3.8%, RAD 4.2%) or at 30 days (ATH 7.1%, RES 5.1%, RAD 5.0%). Even after adjusting for age, gender, symptomatology, CHF, and renal failure, the only statistically significant difference at 30 days was amaurosis fugax between ATH and RAD (odds ratio [OR] 0.13; P = .01).\nAlthough patients with ATH have statistically significant comorbidities, they did not have statistically significant increased rates of death/stroke/MI during hospitalization or within 30 days after discharge when compared to RES or RAD. The CAS event rates for ATH vs RES and RAD are similar, despite prior published reports. Symptomatic ATH have statistically significant higher rates of death/stroke/MI compared to asymptomatic cohort. Finally, consistent and accurate entry of long-term data beyond initial hospitalization is essential to fully assess CAS outcomes since a significant number of adverse events occur in the interval from hospital discharge to 30 days.",

Symptomatic ATH have statistically significant higher rates of death/stroke/MI compared to asymptomatic cohort. Finally, consistent and accurate entry of long-term data beyond initial hospitalization is essential to fully assess CAS outcomes since a significant number of adverse events occur in the interval from hospital discharge to 30 days.",

A total of 2321 patients were available for 30-day outcomes analysis (1623 ATH, 529 restenosis, 119 radiation, 17 dissection, 3 trauma, and 30 other). Baseline demographics showed that ATH occurred in older patients (72-years-old), had the greatest history of coronary artery disease (CAD; 62%), myocardial infarction (MI; 24%), valvular heart disease (8%), arrhythmia (16%), congestive heart failure (CHF; 16%), diabetes mellitus (DM; 35%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 20%). RES had a higher degree of baseline stenosis (87.0 vs 85.8 ATH; P = .010), were less likely to be symptomatic (35.5% vs 46.3% ATH; P < .001), but had a greater history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and smoking. RAD was seen in younger patients (66.6 vs 71.7 ATH; P < .001), were more likely to be male (78.2% vs 60.9% ATH; P < .001), and had less comorbidities overall, with the exception of amaurosis fugax, smoking, and cancer. The only statistically significant difference in perioperative rates was in transient ischemic attack (TIA; 2.7% ATH vs 0.9% RES; P = .02). There were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital death/stroke/MI (ATH 5.4%, RES 3.8%, RAD 4.2%) or at 30 days (ATH 7.1%, RES 5.1%, RAD 5.0%). Even after adjusting for age, gender, symptomatology, CHF, and renal failure, the only statistically significant difference at 30 days was amaurosis fugax between ATH and RAD (odds ratio [OR] 0.13; P = .01).",

    "abstract": "To report midterm results of infrainguinal bypasses performed with a heparin-bonded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft in patients presenting with critical limb ischemia.\nOver a 7-year period ending in 2008, 425 patients presenting with critical limb ischemia underwent infrainguinal revascularization using a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft in seven Italian vascular centers. Preoperative, intraoperative, and follow-up data were collected in a multicenter registry. Patients were predominantly male (79%) with a mean age of 73.5 years. Mean preoperative ankle brachial index (ABI) was 0.35 and 192 of the patients (45%) were diabetic. Intervention consisted of a femoral to below-knee bypass in 324 patients (76%), whereas the remaining 101 patients had a femoral to above-knee bypass. In patients with below-knee bypass, distal target vessels were the popliteal artery in 238 cases, the tibioperoneal trunk in 38 cases, and a tibial vessel in the remaining 48 cases (anterior tibial artery in 20 cases, posterior tibial artery in 23 cases, and peroneal artery in 5). Follow-up consisted of clinical and duplex scanning examinations within 3 months from the intervention and yearly thereafter. Early (<30 day) results were analyzed in terms of deaths, graft thromboses, and amputations with univariate and multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analysis. Follow-up results were evaluated in terms of primary and secondary graft patency, limb salvage, and survival rate with univariate and multivariate (Cox regression) analysis.\nThirteen perioperative deaths occurred (3.1%). Thirty-day primary graft patency was 92.5% and limb salvage was 95.8%. Follow-up was available in 98% of patients with a median duration of 25.5 months (SD, 17.6; range, 1-72). Cumulative estimated 36-month primary and secondary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates were 61%, 70%, 83%, and 83%, respectively. At univariate analysis, the factors associated with poorer limb salvage rates during follow-up were the presence of ischemic ulcers or gangrene (log-rank, 8.4; P = .004; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.5; odds ratio [OR], 2.1), the presence of only one patent tibial vessel (log-rank, 41.3; P < .001; 95% CI, 3.1-10.8, OR, 5.8), redo surgery (log-rank, 12.4; P < .001; 95% CI, 1.4-4; OR, 2.4) and the postoperative treatment with antiplatelet therapy in comparison to oral anticoagulants (log-rank, 5.1; P = .02; 95% CI, 1.0-3.4; OR, 1.8). At multivariate analysis redo surgery (P = .02; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1; OR, 1.8), poor runoff score (P < .001; 95% CI, 2.5-9.1; OR, 4.7) and preoperative clinical status (P = .02; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1; OR, 1.8) were independently associated with decreased limb salvage rates.\nThe use of a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft provides good early and midterm results, with low rates of late amputations. Primary and secondary patency made this graft an excellent alternative to autologous saphenous vein when it is absent, unsuitable, or of poor quality.",

    "abstract": "One of the major concerns in the long-term success of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is stent graft migration, which can cause type I endoleak and even aneurysm rupture. Fixation depends on the mechanical forces between the graft and both the aortic neck and the blood flow. Therefore, there are anatomical restrictions for EVAR, such as short and angulated necks. To improve the fixation of EVAR grafts, elastomer (PDMS) can be injected in the aneurysm sac. The support given by the elastomer might prevent dislocation and migration of the graft. The aim of this study was to measure the influence of an injectable biocompatible elastomer on the fixation strength of different EVAR grafts in an in vitro model.\nThe proximal part of three different stent grafts was inserted in a bovine artery with an attached latex aneurysm. The graft was connected to a tensile testing machine, applying force to the proximal fixation, while the artery with the aneurysm was fixated to the setup. The force to obtain graft dislodgement (DF) from the aorta was recorded in Newtons (N). Three different proximal seal lengths (5, 10, and 15 mm) were evaluated. The experiments were repeated after the space between the graft and the latex aneurysm was filled with the elastomer. Independent sample ttests were used for the comparison between the DF before and after elastomer treatment for each seal length.\nThe mean DF (mean +/- SD) of all grafts without elastomer sac filling for a proximal seal length of 5, 10, and 15 mm were respectively, 4.4 +/- 3.1 N, 12.2 +/- 10.6 N, and 15.1 +/- 6.9 N. After elastomer sac filling, the dislodgement forces increased significantly (P < .001) to 20.9 +/- 3.8 N, 31.8 +/- 9.8 N, and 36.0 +/- 14.1 N, respectively.\nThe present study shows that aneurysm sac filling may have a role as an adjuvant procedure to the present EVAR technique. The strength of the proximal fixation of three different stent grafts increases significantly in this in vitro setting. Further in vivo research must be done to see if this could facilitate the treatment of aneurysms with short infrarenal necks.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysmal involvement of the iliac bifurcation increases the level of difficulty during surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, potentially increasing the risk of early postoperative complications. Three previous randomized trials comparing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open repair (OR) for AAAs showed that EVAR is associated with a lower early mortality rate. However, whether these results are valid for AAA involving the iliac bifurcation (AAAIB) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate early and late results after OR and EVAR for patients with AAA involving the iliac bifurcation.\nOf 1116 patients treated for elective AAA repair between January 1998 and January 2008, 131 presented with AAAIB as detected by computed tomography (CT) scan. Sixty-eight patients were treated by EVAR and 63 by OR. Clinical and anatomic data, operative intervention, and outcomes were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. The median duration of follow-up was 38 months for both groups.\nPatients in the EVAR group (72 +/- 10 years) were older than those in the OR group (64 +/- 8 years; P < .0001), but there were no differences in cardiac, renal, or pulmonary comorbidities between the two groups. Inhospital mortality rates were 2.9% vs 6.3% for EVAR and OR groups, respectively (P = .43). Systemic postoperative complications occurred in 7.4% vs 9.5% (P = .76) and postoperative colonic ischemia in 0% vs 6.3% (P = .051) of patients with EVAR and OR, respectively. Survival rates by Kaplan-Meier analysis were 91 +/- 7% for patients with EVAR and 90 +/- 8% for patients with OR at 2 years, and 61% +/- 15 for EVAR and 79% +/- 13 for OR at 5 years. All-cause reoperation rates were 25% with EVAR and 22% with OR (P = .83). Patients with EVAR were more likely to develop buttock claudication (33.3% vs 3.6%; P < .0001), whereas patients with OR were more prone to develop abdominal wall complications (19.6% vs 0%; P < .001).\nIn this series, the postoperative mortality and systemic complication rates after either EVAR or OR for AAAIB were not statistically different. In the OR group, there were more abdominal wall complications and a trend toward a higher rate of colonic ischemia. In the EVAR group, buttock claudication was more frequent.",

    "abstract": "To review all published reports and investigate the clinical relevance and need for treatment of carotid stent fractures.\nElectronic and hand-searching of the published literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database.\nThirteen articles were published. There are 10 case reports and 3 clinical studies. There are 26 reports of fractured stents in the MAUDE database. Fifty-five cases of carotid stent fractures are reported in total. A total of 201 carotid stents were examined in the 3 studies, and the incidence of fractures was 8.9% (18/201). Fractured stents were 22 Xact, 20 Acculink, 6 Precise, 2 Exponent, 1 Nexstent, 1 Genesis, 1 Symbiot, and 2 nonspecified nitinol self-expandable stents. Twenty-seven of the treated carotid lesions were atherosclerotic, 3 restenoses after carotid endarterectomy, 2 postradiational, 1 pseudoaneurysm, and 22 lesions of unknown pathology. Calcification was reported in 15 of the 27 atherosclerotic lesions (55.5%). Time from implantation to fracture ranged from 0 days (fracture during implantation) to 37 months. In 55% of the cases, stent fracture was associated with restenosis. Six patients presented with symptoms. Treatment was reported for 32 patients: 14 patients underwent de novo stent placement, 2 balloon angioplasty, 2 carotid endarterectomy, 2 bypass graft (1 vein, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene), 1 anticoagulation, and 11 patients were followed up.\nCarotid stent fractures are mainly reported in self-expandable nitinol stents. Plaque calcification may be a risk factor for stent fractures. No difference was observed between open and closed-cell design. Stent fractures were often associated with restenosis and usually were asymptomatic. The actual incidence, clinical relevance, and optimal treatment remain to be clarified from larger prospective studies designed to investigate the issue.",

No difference was observed between open and closed-cell design. Stent fractures were often associated with restenosis and usually were asymptomatic. The actual incidence, clinical relevance, and optimal treatment remain to be clarified from larger prospective studies designed to investigate the issue.",

    "abstract": "Compared to open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is associated with decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality. This study sought to examine the outcomes of EVAR in patients >or=80 years of age.\nThis was a retrospective review from a prospectively maintained computerized database. A total of 322 patients aged >or=80 underwent elective EVAR from January 1997 to November 2007. Mean age was 84 years +/- 3.4 years (range, 80-95 years), and 78.5% were male. Mean aneurysm size was 62 mm +/- 12 mm (range, 39-110 mm).\nMean procedural blood loss was 350 mL (range, 50-2700 mL), and 13.9% required intraoperative transfusion. Mean length of postoperative stay was 2.46 days (median, 1 day; range, 1-42 days), with 54.3% of patients discharged on the first postoperative day. There were 25 (7.8%) perioperative major adverse events. The most common were categorized as device-related (6), cardiac (4), gastrointestinal (4), and bleeding/hematoma (3). The perioperative 30-day mortality rate was 3.1% (10 of 322). Mean follow-up was 25.7 months (range, 1-110 months). Overall, 47 patients (14.6%) required secondary intervention, 7 patients (2.2%) underwent conversion to open repair, and 4 patients (1.2%) died from AAA rupture. Endoleaks occurred in 95 patients (29.4%), with 20 type I, 48 type II, and 27 of indeterminate type; of these, 10 patients with type I endoleaks underwent secondary intervention. Freedom from all-cause mortality at 1 year was 84.3% and at 5 years was 27.4%. Freedom from aneurysm-related mortality at 5 years was 92.9%.\nEVAR in octogenarians is associated with high procedural success and low perioperative morbidity and mortality. The midterm results of this study support the use of EVAR in this patient population. Further studies are needed to predict short-term and long-term mortality risk, and treatment for other causes of death.",

    "abstract": "The use of shunting in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is controversial. This randomized trial compared the results of routine (RS) vs selective shunting (SS) based on stump pressure (SP).\nTwo-hundred CEA patients under general anesthesia were randomized into RS (98 patients) or SS (102 patients), where shunting was used only if systolic SP (SSP) was <40 mm Hg. Clinical and demographic characteristics were comparable in both groups. Patients underwent immediate and 30-day postoperative duplex ultrasound follow-up. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.\nOf 102 SS patients, 29 (28%) received shunting. Indications for CEA were similar (42% symptomatic for RS; 47% for SS, P = .458). The mean internal carotid artery diameter was comparable (5.5 vs 5.5 mm, P = .685). Mean preoperative ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis was 76% and 38% for RS (P = .268) vs 78% and 40% for SS (P = .528). Mean preoperative ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis was 79% and 56% in the shunted (P = .634) vs 78% and 34% in the nonshunted subgroup of SS patients (P = .002). The mean SSP was 55.9 mm Hg in RS vs 56.2 for SS (P = .915). The mean SSP was 33 mm Hg in the shunted vs 65 in the nonshunted subgroup (P < .0001). Mean clamp time in the nonshunted subgroup of SS was 32 minutes. Mean shunt time was 35 minutes in RS and 33 in SS (P = .354). Mean operative time was 113 minutes for RS and 109 for SS (P = .252), and 111 minutes in shunted and 108 in the nonshunted subgroup (P = .586). Mean arteriotomy length was 4.4 cm for RS and 4.2 for SS (P = .213). Perioperative stroke rate was 0% for RS vs 2% for SS (one major and one minor stroke, both related to carotid thrombosis; P = .498). No patients died perioperatively. Combined perioperative transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke rates were 2% in RS vs 2.9% in SS (P > .99). The overall perioperative complication rates were 8.3% in RS (2 TIA, 3 hemorrhage, 1 myocardial infarction [MI], and 1 asymptomatic carotid thrombosis) vs 7.8% in SS (2 strokes, 1 TIA, 3 hemorrhage, 1 MI, and 1 congestive heart failure; P = .917).\nRS and SS were associated with a low stroke rate. Both methods are acceptable, and surgeons should select the method with which they are more comfortable.",

    "abstract": "International treatment guidelines now recognize the importance of thrombus removal to reduce postthrombotic morbidity when treating patients with extensive acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity.\nForty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).\nMean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance.\nPatients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is one of the most accepted treatment options for varicose veins. In previous studies conducted with a laser at 810 to 1320 nm, paresthesia, pain, and ecchymosis were common adverse effects. We hypothesized that a lower linear endovenous energy density (LEED), as used with 1470-nm diode laser fibers, would lead to a reduction in adverse events.\nWe conducted a prospective, nonrandomized observational cohort study of 312 consecutively treated lower limbs legs in 286 patients. Of these, a bare laser fiber (ELVeS-plus kit) was used to treat 168 legs in 150 patients (group 1), and a radial fiber (ELVeS-radial kit) was used in 144 legs in 136 patients (group 2). Laser treatment was performed in the great saphenous vein. Follow-up for all patients was 3 months. The primary end point was the occurrence of ecchymosis and bruising. This was correlated to the reduced LEED needed with the 1470-nm diode laser.\nLaser fiber (odds ratio [OR], 22.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.2-24.5) and body mass index (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.55) were identified as independent parameters for LEED. In group 2 compared with group 1, LEED in the great saphenous vein could be reduced from 79.4 +/- 9.1 to 57.4 +/- 10 J/cm (P < .0001). LEED was an independent parameter for skin bleeding (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.017-1.058). Ecchymosis and bruising were significantly less frequent in group 2 than in group 1 (P < .0001). The need for analgesia was low, with 103.08 +/- 15.34 mg diclofenac-sodium in group 1 vs 82.08 +/- 18.86 mg in group 2 (P < .04). Occlusion with elimination of reflux was achieved in 100% of group 1 and group 2 (P < 1). No recanalization occurred at follow-up.\nEndovenous laser treatment of varicose veins in the great saphenous vein with the 1470-nm diode laser is safe and highly effective. The lower energy level needed using the radial laser fiber significantly minimized adverse effects compared with the bare laser fiber.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons have increasingly become proficient in carotid artery stenting (CAS) as an alternative treatment modality for cervical carotid artery occlusive disease. We analyzed our early and late outcomes of CAS over the last 8 years.\nWe report a single-center retrospective review of 388 carotid bifurcation lesions treated with CAS using cerebral embolic protection from May 2001 to July 2009. Data analysis includes demographics, procedural records, duplex exams, arteriograms, and two-view plain radiographs over a mean follow-up time of 23.0 months (interquartile range, 10.9-35.4).\nAt the time of treatment, the mean age of the entire cohort (76% men and 24% women) is 71 years; 13% were >/=80 years of age, and 31% had a prior history of either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and/or external beam neck irradiation (XRT). The mean carotid stenosis is 80%, and asymptomatic lesions represent 69% of the group. Overall 30-day rates of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction are 0.5%, 1.8%, and 0.8%, respectively. The combined death/stroke rate at 30 days is 2.3%. The 30-day major/minor stroke rates for analyzed subgroups are statistically significant only for XRT/recurrent stenosis vs de novo lesions, 0% and 2.6% (P = .03), but not for asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients, 1.9% and 1.7% (P = .91) and age <80 vs >/=80, 2.0% and 1.8% (P = .52), respectively. At long-term, the freedom from all strokes at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months was 99.2%, 97.6%, 96.7%, and 96.7%, respectively. At late follow-up, the restenosis rate is 3.5%. Restenosis rates for recurrent stenosis/XRT vs de novo lesions are 2.7% and 3.4% (P = .39). Among the restenotic lesions were two associated type III stent fractures in de novo lesions, both of which were closed-cell stents. An additional two other type I fractures have been identified, yielding a stent fracture rate of 5.5%. The late death rate for the entire group is 16.8%, with one stent-related death secondary to ipsilateral stroke at 20 months (0.3% death rate).\nVascular surgeons performing CAS with embolic protection can achieve good early and late outcomes that are comparable to CEA benchmarks. Late stent failures (stroke, restenosis, and/or stent fatigue), while uncommon, are a recognized delayed problem.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis access by autogenous arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) is generally recommended due to lower mortality, morbidity, and cost vs graft and catheter use. Many dialysis patients lack the common superficial veins used for standard AVF options and require transposition of a deep vein for autogenous dialysis access through a long open incision (open/AVF-T). These operations may require prolonged time for healing, thus extending catheter-based dialysis. We report our experience with minimally invasive techniques for creating AVF-Ts using an endoscopic procedure (endo/AVF-T).\nWe reviewed our vascular access database of consecutive access operations to identify consecutive patients with endo/AVF-Ts. For comparison, we also reviewed the immediate preceding traditional open/AVF-T operations that we previously reported. We evaluated demographics, time to access use, and primary, assisted, and cumulative patency.\nWe identified 100 consecutive endo/AVF-T operations attempted, and 98 were technically successful. The analysis excluded two conversions to successful open/AVF-T. The mean age of the 98 patients in the endo/AVF-T study group was 60 years (range, 22-94 years), 59 (60.2%) were women, 48 (49.0%) were diabetic, 20 (20.4%) were obese, and 52 (53.1%) had had previous access surgery. Mean time to initial use of the access for endo/AVF-Ts was 6 weeks for primary and 12 weeks for staged transpositions. Mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 1-30 months). The 12- and 24-month cumulative patencies were 95.5% and 88.6%. The 78 traditional open/AVF-T operations from our previous report were reviewed for comparison. The mean age was 62 years (range, 18-83 years), 57 (73.1%) were women, 44 (56.4%) were diabetic, 15 (19.2%) were obese, and 46 (59.0%) had previous access surgery. Mean time to initial use of the access for open/AVF-Ts was 8 weeks for primary and 16 weeks for staged operations. Mean follow-up was 18 months (range, 3-48 months). The 12- and 24-month cumulative patencies were 96.0 and 88.9%. No grafts were used in any patient during the study period.\nTime to access use was less with endoscopic AVF-T (P < .01) for both primary and staged operations. Primary, assisted, and cumulative patency rates were the same for open and technically successful endoscopic transpositions. Endoscopic AVF-Ts offer a viable alternative to open AVF-Ts.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment for varicose recurrence (STVR) involves removing all sources of reflux from the deep venous network to the superficial venous network. STVR is usually more complex and aggressive than first-line treatment by stripping, particularly for redo surgery at the groin (RSG). This retrospective study compared traditional STVR and a less aggressive surgical approach focusing on treatment of the varicose reservoir and avoiding RSG if possible.\nTwo successive periods of STVR after great saphenous vein stripping were compared: traditional STVR (T1) and STVR focusing on the varicose reservoir (T2). We reviewed postoperative complications and studied the hemodynamic and clinical results.\nDuring T1 and T2, we operated 473 legs in 288 patients (236 women, 52 men) to treat varicose recurrence after great saphenous vein stripping. Mean age was 60.83 years (range, 28-88 years). We operated on 137 patients during T1 and 151 during T2. Patients had similar demographic data, CEAP classification, and Venous Disability Score. Inguinal reflux occurred in 73.9% of T1 patients and in 74.4% of T2 patients. We performed RSG in 66.0% of T1 patients and in 2.2% of T2 patients (P < .05). We did not use echo-guided sclerotherapy in addition to primary STVR. Tumescent local anesthesia was used in 96.2% of STVR in T2 vs 4.0% in T1 (P < .05), and 95.3% of T2 procedures were outpatient vs 13.7% of T1 (P < .05). Outcomes of limbs presenting an inguinal reflux treated with RSG during T1 (group 1) and without RSG during T2 (group 2) were compared. Postoperative complications occurred in 6.7% in group 1 vs 0.5% in group 2 (P < .05), with inguinal complications predominating. The mean cost of the procedure per limb was euro1,195.88 in group 1 vs euro863.08 in group 2 (P < .0001). After 3 years of follow-up, Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis showed group 1 and 2 patients had similar rates of freedom from inguinal reflux (90.8% vs 92.9% survival rate) and from varicose repeat-recurrence (90.8% vs 91.9% survival rate). Group 1 had better results for the Venous Disability Score (0.38 vs 0.58, P = .02) and cosmetic improvement (94.2% vs 84.2%; P = .00032).\nSTVR focusing on the varicose reservoir and avoiding RSG led to a minimally invasive procedure and a reduction in postoperative complications, with good medium-term clinical and hemodynamic results, particularly for symptoms improvement and cosmetic appearance, with a lower cost vs traditional STVR with RSG.",

    "abstract": "Aortic Customize is a new concept for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair in which a non polymerized elastomer is injected to fill the aneurysm sac around a balloon catheter. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the extent of aneurysm wall stress reduction by the presence of a noncompliant elastomer cuff.\nA thin-walled latex aneurysm (inner radius sac 18 mm, inner radius neck 8 mm), equipped with 12 tantalum markers, was attached to an in vitro circulation model. Fluoroscopic roentgenographic stereo photogrammetric analysis (FRSA) was used to measure marker movement during six cardiac cycles. The radius of three circles drawn through the markers was measured before and after sac filling. Wall movement was measured at different systemic pressures. Wall stress was calculated from the measured radius (sigma = pr/2t).\nThe calculated wall stress was 7.5-15.6 N/cm(2) before sac filling and was diminished to 0.43-1.1 N/cm(2) after sac filling. Before sac filling, there was a clear increase (P < .001) in radius of the proximal (range, 7.9%-33.5%), middle (range, 3.3%-25.2%), and distal (range, 10.5%-184.3%) rings with increasing systemic pressure. After sac filling with the elastomer, there remained a small, significant (P < .001) increase in the radius of the circles (ranges: 6.8%-8.8%; 0.7%-1.1%; 5.3%-6.7%). The sac filling reduced the extent of radius increase. The treated aneurysm withstood systemic pressures up to 220/140 mm Hg without noticeable wall movement. After the sac filling, there was no pulsation visible in the aneurysm wall.\nFilling the aneurysm sac of a simplified in vitro latex model with a biocompatible elastomer leads to successful exclusion of the aneurysm sac from the circulation. Wall movement and calculated wall stress are diminished noticeably by the injection of biocompatible elastomer.",

Endovascular repair has been shown to be safer than open surgical repair in patients with large aneurysms, prompting a randomized trial of early endovascular repair vs surveillance in patients with small aneurysms.\nWe randomly assigned 728 patients (13.3% women; mean age, 71 +/- 8 years) with 4 to 5 cm AAAs to early endovascular repair (366 patients) or ultrasound surveillance (362 patients). Rupture or aneurysm-related death and overall mortality in the two groups were compared during a mean follow-up of 20 +/- 12 months.\nAmong patients randomized to treatment, 89% underwent aneurysm repair. Among patients randomized to surveillance, 31% underwent aneurysm repair during the course of the study. After a mean follow-up of 20 +/- 12 months (range, 0-41 months), 15 deaths had occurred in each group (4.1%). The unadjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for mortality after early endovascular repair was 1.01 (0.49-2.07, P = .98). Aneurysm rupture or aneurysm-related death occurred in two patients in each group (0.6%). The unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.99 (0.14-7.06, P = .99) for early endovascular repair.\nEarly treatment with endovascular repair and rigorous surveillance with selective aneurysm treatment as indicated both appear to be safe alternatives for patients with small AAAs, protecting the patient from rupture or aneurysm-related death for at least 3 years.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been repeatedly described as a safe and efficacious procedure to provide a stroke-risk reduction benefit in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Contemporary outcomes are acceptable using the large-scale randomized trials as a metric of success. Class I and II data can be applied to improve the care process of patients undergoing CEA. Myocardial infarction remains the most significant nonstroke complication; however, there is no significant benefit to noninvasive stress testing in patients with clinically stable disease. Perioperative beta-blockade may offer up to a 10-fold reduction in the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction, but deleterious effects are attributable to high-dose regimens. Angiotensin blockade has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with atherosclerosis by up to 25%, although few studies have examined these agents directly in carotid surgery patients. Statins are beneficial to patients undergoing CEA with trials demonstrating up to a 3% absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke following CEA. Aspirin therapy is associated with an up to 7% absolute reduction in early stroke following CEA; however, the efficacy of combination or high-dose antiplatelet therapy remains ill-defined. A treatment strategy that involves perioperative medical optimization is likely to improve surgical outcomes and long-term cardiovascular risk for patients undergoing CEA.",

    "abstract": "This study delineated correlations between ferritin, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in a cohort of 100 cancer-free patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) participating in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study #410, the Iron (Fe) and Atherosclerosis Study (FeAST). FeAST, a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial, tested the hypothesis that reduction of iron stores using phlebotomy would influence clinical outcomes in 1227 PAD patients randomized to iron reduction or control groups. The effects of statin administration were also examined in the Sierra Nevada Health Care (SNHC) cohort by measuring serum ferritin levels at entry and during the 6-year study period. No difference was documented between treatment groups in all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of death plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. Iron reduction in the main study caused a significant age-related improvement in cardiovascular disease outcomes, new cancer diagnoses, and cancer-specific death.\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-alpha receptors 1 and 2, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at entry and at 6-month intervals for 6 years. Average levels of ferritin and lipids at entry and at the end of the study were compared. The clinical course and ferritin levels of 23 participants who died during the study were reviewed.\nAt entry, mean age of entry was 67 +/- 9 years for the SNHCS cohort, comparable to FeAST and clinical and laboratory parameters were equivalent in substudy participants randomized to iron reduction (n = 51) or control (n = 49). At baseline, 53 participants on statins had slightly lower mean entry-level ferritin values (114.06 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 93.43-134.69) vs the 47 off statins (127.62 ng/mL; 95% CI, 103.21-152.02). Longitudinal analysis of follow-up data, after adjusting for the phlebotomy treatment effect, showed that statin use was associated with significantly lower ferritin levels (-29.78 ng/mL; Cohen effect size, -0.47 [t(df, 134) = 2.33, P = .02]). Mean follow-up average ferritin levels were higher in 23 participants who died (132.5 ng/mL; 95% CI, 79.36-185.66) vs 77 survivors (83.6 ng/mL; 95% CI, 70.34-96.90; Wilcoxon P = .05).

Ferritin levels correlated (Pearson) with average IL-6 levels (r = 0.1845; P = .002) and hsCRP levels (r = .1175; P = .04) during the study.\nThese data demonstrate statistical correlations between levels of ferritin, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in this subset of patients with PAD.",

VCF placement in the absence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus (PE) was categorized as prophylactic.\nDuring the study period, the estimated rate of hospitalizations per year with a diagnosis of DVT (odds ratio [OR], 1.025; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.019-1.032; P < .01) or PE (OR, 1.076; 95% CI, 1.069-1.083; P < .01) rose significantly. The estimated weighted frequency of VCF placement increased from 52,860 procedures in 1998 to 104,114 procedures in 2005 (0.15% and 0.27% of all discharges, respectively), representing an 80% increase. VCF placement significantly increased during hospitalizations with any diagnosis of DVT or PE, or both, and no DVT or PE (P < .01 for each). Logistic regression models revealed that the rate of prophylactic VCF placement increased at a significantly higher rate than VCF placement associated with DVT or PE (157% vs 42%; P < .01), after adjusting for age, gender, and hospital characteristics. Prophylactic VCF placement in the setting of morbid obesity (P < .01) and head injury (P = .03) rose significantly over time.\nFrom 1998 to 2005, the estimated rates of prophylactic VCF placement increased at a significantly higher rate than VCF placement in the setting of DVT or PE. Significant increases in the use of prophylactic VCFs were seen in the setting of morbid obesity and head injury.",

The estimated weighted frequency of VCF placement increased from 52,860 procedures in 1998 to 104,114 procedures in 2005 (0.15% and 0.27% of all discharges, respectively), representing an 80% increase. VCF placement significantly increased during hospitalizations with any diagnosis of DVT or PE, or both, and no DVT or PE (P < .01 for each). Logistic regression models revealed that the rate of prophylactic VCF placement increased at a significantly higher rate than VCF placement associated with DVT or PE (157% vs 42%; P < .01), after adjusting for age, gender, and hospital characteristics. Prophylactic VCF placement in the setting of morbid obesity (P < .01) and head injury (P = .03) rose significantly over time.",

    "abstract": "A woman presented for evaluation of new-onset left arm edema after failed laser-assisted pacemaker lead extraction. Initial workup demonstrated a left subclavian artery to vein arteriovenous fistula (AVF). She underwent repair of the AVF with placement of a covered stent in the subclavian artery, however, her symptoms did not completely resolve. Investigation revealed a left common carotid artery to left innominate vein AVF, which was repaired by deploying a covered stent retrograde into the left common carotid artery. Her symptoms subsequently resolved. Multiple iatrogenic AVF can be repaired endovascularly, however, a high degree of suspicion for multiple injuries should be maintained.",

    "abstract": "The goal was to compare the outcomes in patients with disabling claudication (DC) or critical limb ischemia (CLI) to determine if diabetics (DM) have poorer patency, limb salvage (LS), and survival rates than nondiabetic patients and if the diabetic regimen affects these outcomes.\nAll patients who presented with DC or CLI between June 2001 and September 2008 were included. Non-DM patients were compared with those with DM who are currently managed by diet only or oral medications (D-OM), oral medications plus insulin (OM+INS), or insulin alone (INS).\nOf the 746 patients (886 limbs), there were 406 patients (464 limbs) in non-DM, 96 patients (135 limbs) in D-OM, 98 patients (118 limbs) in OM+INS, and 146 patients (185 limbs) in INS groups. There were more patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, and renal insufficiency in the DM group than non-DM, with the INS group having the highest incidence of renal insufficiency/dialysis (46%/20%). Gangrene and foot sepsis were significantly more frequent in patients in OM+INS (45%/3%) and INS (50%/6%) than non-DM (15%/0.2%) and D-OM groups (25%/1%; P < .001). More patients in the INS group (14%) and OM+INS (9%) had primary amputation than non-DM (4%) and D-OM (4%; P < .01). Mean follow-up was 26.3 +/- 20.7 months. Overall survival following revascularization was similar in D-OM and non-DM and OM+INS and INS, the latter being significantly worse (P < .001). The LS rate in D-OM and non-DM was also identical, whereas OM-INS and INS had significantly worse LS, with OM-INS marginally better than INS (P = .094). Primary patency (PP) was worse in endovascular-treated patients on insulin than non-DM and D-OM patients (P < .001), whereas PP was similar between groups in open-treated patients. Multivariate analysis showed that coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indication for intervention, insulin use, nonambulatory status, and statin drug non-use were independently associated with decreased survival, whereas insulin use, presence of gangrene, need for infrapopliteal interventions, and nonambulatory status were independently associated with limb loss. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification of the treated lesions being C or D, infrapopliteal interventions, and indication of intervention (DC vs CLI) were independently associated with primary patency, whereas insulin use was not.\nDiabetic patients who present with limb ischemia can be subdivided into three distinct subgroups based on their diabetic regimen. The survival and LS rates of those controlled with diet or OM are nearly identical to nondiabetics, both of which are significantly better than OM+INS or INS. The PP rate in endovascular-treated patients is worse in patients who are on insulin. Being on insulin is independently associated with decreased survival and limb loss but not PP.",

    "abstract": "The national burden of venous disease and use of ultrasound (US) in the outpatient and emergency department (ED) settings has not been well described. The objective of this study is to describe venous disease in the outpatient and ED settings nationally as well as to characterize the use of US for diagnosis of venous disease, including phlebitis.\nData from the 1997 to 2006 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) were compiled, and complex sampling methods were used to describe the number of outpatient and ED visits for adults given a diagnosis of venous disease or phlebitis by ICD-9 coding. Logistic regression analysis with calculated odds ratios are used to examined patient visit characteristics and use of US.\nDuring the 10 years studied, an office or ED visit for venous disease occurred over 46 million times, for an average of 4.6 million visits per year, with this rate increasing from 4.03 million to 5.71 million per year (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.01). The majority of these patients were seen by specialists, such as surgeons or cardiologists, but a significant number were also seen by primary care providers (PCP). There were 2 million office visits (PCP and specialists) on average per year with no significant increase. There were approximately 236,000 ED visits for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on average per year, which showed a small increase (OR 1.01, CI 1.00-1.01). Visits for DVT and phlebitis were as likely to be seen by PCPs as ED physicians. Non-DVT venous disease is much more likely to be seen by a surgeon (OR 4.88, CI 3.53-6.74) than a PCP. DVT is much less likely to be diagnosed by a specialist (OR 0.27, CI 0.18-0.29) than a PCP. Insurance status and geographic region were not associated with DVT or non-DVT venous disease diagnosis.\nNationally, a significant and growing number of patients with venous disease are being seen in the outpatient setting by PCPs and specialists. A significant number of patients with DVT are being seen in the outpatient setting, but without a trend away from care in the ED over the 10-year study period. Additionally, the majority of patients with DVT diagnosis do not seem to be getting ultrasounds at the same visit. Many of these patients are being seen by PCPs who may require additional training and infrastructure for appropriate patient care.",

    "abstract": "Even when promptly recognized and treated, aortoesophageal (AEF) and aortobronchial (ABF) fistulae are highly lethal conditions. Open surgical repair also carries a high risk of mortality and morbidity. Several alternative strategies have been recently reported in the literature including thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, relatively little is known about results of TEVAR for AEF and ABF due to their rarity and the lack of large surveys.\nA voluntary national survey was conducted among Italian universities and hospital centers with an endovascular program. Questionnaires were distributed by e-mail to participating centers and aimed to evaluate the results of endovascular repair of established AEF or ABF.\nSeventeen centers agreed to participate and provided data on their patients. Between 1998 and 2008, a total of 1138 patients were treated with TEVAR. In 25 patients (2.2%), the indication to treatment was an AEF and/or an ABF. In 10 of these cases (40%), an associated open surgical procedure was also performed. Thirty-day mortality rate of AEF/ABF endovascular repair was 28% (7 cases). No cases of paraplegia or stroke were observed. Mean follow-up was 22.6 months (range, 1-62). Actuarial survival at 2 years was 55%. Among the 18 initial survivors, five patients (28%) underwent reintervention due to late TEVAR failure.\nStent grafting for AEF and ABF represents a viable option in emergent and urgent settings. However, further esophageal or bronchial repair is necessary in most cases. Despite less invasive attempts, mortality associated with these conditions remains very high.",

    "abstract": "Venous thoracic outlet syndrome progressing to the point of axilosubclavian vein thrombosis, variously referred to as Paget-Schroetter syndrome or effort thrombosis, is a classic example of an entity which if treated correctly has minimal long-term sequelae but if ignored is associated with significant long-term morbidity. The subclavian vein is highly vulnerable to injury as it passes by the junction of the first rib and clavicle in the anterior-most part of the thoracic outlet. In addition to extrinsic compression, repetitive forces in this area frequently lead to fixed intrinsic damage and extrinsic scar tissue formation. Once primary thrombosis is recognized, catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is usually successful if initiated within ten to 14 days of clot formation, but often unmasks an underlying lesion. The vast majority of investigators believe that decompression of the venous thoracic outlet, usually by means of first rib excision, partial anterior scalenectomy, resection of the costoclavicular ligament, and thorough external venolysis, is necessary, although opinion is less uniform as to the need for and method of treatment of the venous lesion itself. Using this algorithm, long-term success rates of 95 to 100% have been reported by many investigators. This review, in addition to discussing the overall treatment algorithm in more detail, attempts to point out controversies that still exist and research directions, both clinical and basic, that need to be pursued. Prospective randomized trials addressing this entity are surprisingly lacking, and although there is consensus based on experience, it may be necessary to step back and rigorously explore several aspects of this entity.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to define the outcomes of treating aortic aneurysms involving the arch vessels with a hybrid approach using extra-anatomic reconstruction and endovascular repair with nonfenestrated stents.\nA single-center review was done of arch aneurysm endovascular repairs during an 8-year period. Data were collected for patient demographics and aneurysm pathology. Any revascularization procedures performed were analyzed to detect differences between groups and through fitting a logistic regression model. The outcome measures were postoperative death, stroke, and paraplegia.\nBetween 2001 and 2009, 78 patients (65% men; mean age, 65 years) underwent endovascular repair of aortic arch aneurysms. Coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) was necessary in all patients to access an adequate proximal landing zone. An Ishimaru zone 0 proximal landing zone was present in 9 patients, 17 had zone 1, and 52 had zone 2. Fifty patients (64%) underwent elective endografting with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%, and 28 patients (36%) underwent emergency procedures with a mortality rate of 14.3%. The LSA was revascularized in 31 elective (62%) and 4 emergency patients (14%). LSA revascularization was associated with significantly better outcomes for the combined measure of death, stroke, and paraplegia (odds ratio [OR], 15.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-142; P = .012). Patients with an atherosclerotic aneurysm had worse outcomes than those with aortic dissection (OR, 5.52; 95% CI 1.26-24.4; P = .024), with dissections having preponderance toward emergency procedures (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.12-7.58; P = .035).\nAneurysms involving the aortic arch vessels can be effectively treated by staged endovascular-surgical hybrid procedures with good outcomes that can be further improved through prior revascularization of the LSA.",

An Ishimaru zone 0 proximal landing zone was present in 9 patients, 17 had zone 1, and 52 had zone 2. Fifty patients (64%) underwent elective endografting with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%, and 28 patients (36%) underwent emergency procedures with a mortality rate of 14.3%. The LSA was revascularized in 31 elective (62%) and 4 emergency patients (14%). LSA revascularization was associated with significantly better outcomes for the combined measure of death, stroke, and paraplegia (odds ratio [OR], 15.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-142; P = .012). Patients with an atherosclerotic aneurysm had worse outcomes than those with aortic dissection (OR, 5.52; 95% CI 1.26-24.4; P = .024), with dissections having preponderance toward emergency procedures (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.12-7.58; P = .035).",

    "abstract": "The choice between open surgery (OS) and transluminal carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS) for the treatment of primary carotid stenosis remains controversial. However, CAS is considered a valid option for selected cases, such as recurrent carotid stenosis (RCS). Tertiary RCS seems to be a concerning issue after CAS but few large reports focused on the durability of CAS and OS. We report our early and long-term results with OS for RCS.\nFrom 1989 to 2006, perioperative data regarding 4245 consecutive surgical carotid reconstructions was prospectively collected. Patients whose indication was RCS were subjected to further analysis. Indications for surgery were symptomatic RCS >50% or asymptomatic RCS >80%. Freedom from neurologic event was defined as the absence of any ipsilateral symptom at any time after the procedure. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate freedom from reintervention, freedom from restenosis >50% and occlusion, freedom from neurologic event and survival.\nA total of 119 patients (2.8%) with RCS underwent OS. The average time from the primary OS was 59.4 +/- 54.5 months (range, 2-204). Forty-nine patients (41%) were symptomatic. In 103 patients (87%), the technique did not differ from a primary approach. Postoperative (<30 days) combined stroke and death rate was 3.3%. Cranial nerve injury occurred in 5 cases (4.2%). With a mean follow-up of 53 +/- 48 months (range, 1-204), 3 patients had an ipsilateral stroke (including one hemorrhagic stroke) and 7 were diagnosed with a tertiary RCS >50%. At 5 years, Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from reintervention, freedom from restenosis and occlusion, freedom from neurologic event, and survival were 99%, 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively.\nOS for RCS is not a high-risk procedure and provides excellent long-term results, with low rates of tertiary RCS and reinterventions. The comparison between OS and CAS in this indication suffers from the absence of standardized follow-up paradigms after primary OS and the lack of prospective randomized trial comparing the two techniques. Despite these limitations in the available data, we conclude that OS should remain the first line therapy when treatment of RCS is indicated.",

    "abstract": "Coarctation of the aorta with cardiac lesions or complex coarctation is a formidable challenge for cardiac surgeons. Extra-anatomic bypass allows simultaneous intracardiac repair or an alternative approach for patients with complex coarctation.\nBetween July 1997 and March 2008, 43 patients with coarctation of the aorta underwent extra-anatomic bypass grafting, including 10 ascending-to-descending aorta bypasses and 33 ascending aorta-to-infrarenal abdominal aorta bypasses. Forty patients had additional cardiovascular disorders and concomitant procedures performed including aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus, ascending aorta repair, and the Bentall procedure. The other three patients had complex coarctation of the aorta, including a long-segment coarctation in two cases, and descending aortic aneurysm in one.\nTwo patients died perioperatively: one due to air embolism during the cardiopulmonary bypass; one due to septic shock. There were no late deaths. Complications included laparotomy for mechanical ileus in one and re-exploration for bleeding in one case. There were no strokes or paraplegia and no grafted-related complication during follow-up period. Systolic blood pressure dropped from 160 +/- 27 mm Hg before surgery to 114 +/- 16 mm Hg postoperatively. Only two patients with mild hypertension postoperatively needed oral medicine.\nExtra-anatomic aortic bypass via median sternotomy or median sternotomy-laparotomy can be performed with low morbidity and mortality. It is a preferable single-stage approach for patients with concomitant complex coarctation and cardiovascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is associated with a more aggressive form of atherosclerosis. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix protein, is an acute-phase reactant that induces vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) migration and proliferation in areas of vascular injury and is also up-regulated in VSMCs exposed to hyperglycemia. This study tested the hypothesis that hyperglycemia amplifies the expression of genes induced by TSP-1 in VSMCs.\nHuman aortic VSMCs were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics. Cells were used between passages three and five. VSMCs were preincubated in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS with 5 mM glucose (normoglycemia), 25 mM glucose (hyperglycemia), 25 mM mannose (osmotic control), TSP-1 (20 microg/mL), 25 mM glucose + TSP-1 (20 microg/mL), or 25 mM mannose + TSP-1 (20 microg/mL). Total RNA was extracted. Microarray analysis was performed and analyzed by analysis of variance. P < .05 was considered significant. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) was used to confirm selected up-regulated genes.\nMicroarray analysis revealed: (1) hyperglycemia altered 30 genes; (2) TSP-1 altered 212 genes, of which 8 were altered similarly to VSMCs exposed to 25 mM glucose; (3) TSP-1 up-regulated 10 genes associated with atherosclerosis and 4 others with diabetic vascular disease; (4) hyperglycemia combined with TSP-1 altered expression of 2822 genes. The three genes most up-regulated by TSP-1 in a normoglycemic environment were uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) dehydrogenase (UGDH, 127%), transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFbeta2, 116%), and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2, 113%). Further, TSP-1 altered the expression of genes in 13 canonical pathways; however, when combined with hyperglycemia, 53 canonical pathways were affected.\nQuantitative rtPCR confirmed that genes in several of these pathways for TSP-1 and hyperglycemia combined with TSP-1 were up-regulated. These findings suggest that TSP-1 may be germane to the progression of atherosclerosis and may have a large effect with concurrent hyperglycemia.",

    "abstract": "The development of an ideal small-diameter conduit for use in vascular bypass surgery has yet to be achieved. The ongoing innovation in biomaterial design generates novel conduits that require preclinical assessment in vivo, and a number of animal models have been used for this purpose. This article examines the rationale behind animal models used in the assessment of small-diameter vascular conduits encompassing the commonly used species: baboons, sheep, pigs, dogs, rabbits, and rodents. Studies on the comparative hematology for these species relative to humans are summarized, and the hydrodynamic values for common implant locations are also compared. The large- and small-animal models are then explored, highlighting the characteristics of each that determine their relative utility in the assessment of vascular conduits. Where possible, the performance of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene is given in each animal and in each location to allow direct comparisons between species. New challenges in animal modeling are outlined for the assessment of tissue-engineered graft designs. Finally, recommendations are given for the selection of animal models for the assessment of future vascular conduits.",

    "abstract": "Various types of device-specific adverse events can occur during deployment of thoracic stent grafts due to the high flow rate and severe aortic angulation that is often encountered in the thoracic aorta. This study assessed the incidence, etiology, and overall effect of misaligned deployment of the Talent Thoracic Stent Graft (TSG) System. Techniques to predict and avoid this complication are discussed.\nData collection included pivotal-trial follow-up, direct surveys of centers inside and outside the United States and principal investigators, a targeted literature search, and review of complaint files. Misaligned deployment was considered to occur when the proximal covered or uncovered stent apices of a thoracic stent graft folded back on itself and remained nonparallel to the wall of the aorta after deployment had been completed.\nOf about 20,305 deployments to date of the Talent TSG, 24 misaligned deployments were identified for an incidence of 0.1%. Nineteen (79%) events occurred during treatment of degenerative aneurysms or penetrating ulcers, four (17%) during treatment of dissections, and the underlying pathology could not be determined for one patient. The misalignment was noted at the proximal end of the stent graft in 15 patients (63%), and the other 9 events (37%) occurred at the graft overlap junction. Two events were treated intraoperatively, with a second overlapping device placed in one patient and a snare used to reposition the proximal stent in another. Adverse clinical events occurred in three patients and included a persistent type I endoleak, continued false lumen perfusion in a patient with dissection, and delayed retrograde type A dissection in a patient undergoing total arch repair. No intraoperative contrast extravasation or computed tomography evidence of perforation was noted. There were no perioperative deaths or cerebrovascular events, with one report of paraplegia among the 24 patients in this series.\nMisaligned deployment is an unusual phenomenon that tends to occur in the context of certain well-defined anatomic conditions in the thoracic aorta. To date, most of these events have not led to significant adverse sequelae. However, careful patient selection, periprocedural imaging, and case planning can help to identify anatomies in which misaligned opening is likely to occur, allowing physicians to avoid this complication.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the postoperative quality of life (QOL) experienced among a group of 1167 patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy (VATS) to treat primary hyperhidrosis, as compared with the presurgical QOL.\nBetween February 2002 and June 2007, 1167 patients who had undergone VATS were surveyed. The majority had presented with palmar hyperhidrosis (794 patients; 68%), while 340 (29%) had presented with axillary hyperhidrosis. Based on data obtained from the QOL protocol applied to all of the patients preoperatively, the patients were divided into two groups according to the level of their QOL: group 1 consisted of 312 patients (27%) with poor QOL and group 2 of 855 patients (73%) with very poor QOL. The same protocol was applied postoperatively, and five different levels of satisfaction were obtained. The same parameters were evaluated for both the palmar and the axillary hyperhidrosis subgroups.\nThe patients with very poor QOL had much better results in terms of improvement in QOL than did those with poor QOL (P < .05). The same result was observed for both the palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis subgroups (P < .05).\nThe worse the preoperative QOL among patients undergoing sympathectomy to treat primary hyperhidrosis is, the better the postoperative improvement in QOL will be.",

Cognitive brain function was objectively measured by means of P300 auditory evoked potentials (peak latencies in milliseconds [ms]) before CEA, at discharge, and at 1 and 5 years. Values were compared with 25 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals.\nCognitive P300 evoked potentials were prolonged (ie, impaired) in patients before CEA compared with controls (vertex [Cz], 384 +/- 52 vs 357 +/- 16 ms, P = .020]. At 1 year, P300 evoked potentials were significantly shortened (ie, improved) in patients after CEA compared with baseline values [Cz, 371 +/- 38 vs 384 +/- 52 ms, P = .010]. Furthermore, no difference between patients after CEA and controls was observed [Cz, 371 +/- 38 vs 360 +/- 14 ms, P = .21]. This effect was sustained at 5 years, and P300 evoked potentials continued to be significantly shortened (ie, improved) in patients after CEA compared with baseline values [Cz, 367 +/- 39 vs 384 +/- 52 ms, P = .040]. Continuing, no difference between patients after CEA and controls could be observed [Cz, 367 +/- 39 vs 362 +/- 17 ms, P = .58]. These results could be confirmed in repeated measures analysis of variance for Cz (P = .025) and frontal (Fz) results (P = .018).\nCEA improves previously impaired cognitive brain function as shown by P300 measurements similar to normal cognitive brain function of age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. This beneficial effect is sustained up to 5 years after treatment.",

    "abstract": "Although contrast venography is the standard imaging method for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging is a safe and effective option that allows for bedside filter placement and is especially advantageous for immobilized critically ill patients by limiting resource use, risk of transportation, and cost. This study reviewed the effectiveness of a prospectively implemented algorithm for IVUS-guided IVC filter placement in this high-risk population.\nCurrent evidence-based guidelines were used to create a clinical decision algorithm for IVUS-guided IVC filter placement in critically ill patients. After a defined lead-in phase to allow dissemination of techniques, the algorithm was prospectively implemented on January 1, 2008. Data were collected for 1 year using accepted reporting standards and a quality assurance review performed based on intent-to-treat at 6, 12, and 18 months.\nAs defined in the prospectively implemented algorithm, 109 patients met criteria for IVUS-directed bedside IVC filter placement. Technical feasibility was 98.1%. Only 2 patients had inadequate IVUS visualization for bedside filter placement and required subsequent placement in the endovascular suite. Technical success, defined as proper deployment in an infrarenal position, was achieved in 104 of the remaining 107 patients (97.2%). The filter was permanent in 21 (19.6%) and retrievable in 86 (80.3%). The single-puncture technique was used in 101 (94.4%), with additional dual access required in 6 (5.6%). Periprocedural complications were rare but included malpositioning requiring retrieval and repositioning in three patients, filter tilt >/=15 degrees in two, and arteriovenous fistula in one. The 30-day mortality rate for the bedside group was 5.5%, with no filter-related deaths.\nSuccessful placement of IVC filters using IVUS-guided imaging at the bedside in critically ill patients can be established through an evidence-based prospectively implemented algorithm, thereby limiting the need for transport in this high-risk population.",

Only 2 patients had inadequate IVUS visualization for bedside filter placement and required subsequent placement in the endovascular suite. Technical success, defined as proper deployment in an infrarenal position, was achieved in 104 of the remaining 107 patients (97.2%). The filter was permanent in 21 (19.6%) and retrievable in 86 (80.3%). The single-puncture technique was used in 101 (94.4%), with additional dual access required in 6 (5.6%). Periprocedural complications were rare but included malpositioning requiring retrieval and repositioning in three patients, filter tilt >/=15 degrees in two, and arteriovenous fistula in one. The 30-day mortality rate for the bedside group was 5.5%, with no filter-related deaths.",

    "abstract": "Isopropylamine NONOate (IPA/NO) is a nitroxyl (HNO) donor at physiologic pH. HNO is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, but little is known about its effect on neointimal hyperplasia. The aims of this study are to determine the effect of IPA/NO on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and to determine if IPA/NO inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in vivo.\nVSMC were harvested from the abdominal aortas of male Sprague Dawley rats, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased from ATCC. In vitro, cellular proliferation was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, cell migration was assessed using the scrape assay, and cell death was assessed using Guava personal cell analysis (PCA). Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. Protein expression was assessed using Western blot analysis. Phosphorylated proteins were assessed using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. In vivo, the carotid artery injury model was performed on male Sprague Dawley rats treated with (n = 12) or without (n = 6) periadventitial IPA/NO (10 mg). Arteries harvested at 2 weeks were assessed for morphometrics using ImageJ. Inflammation was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Endothelialization was assessed by Evans blue staining of carotid arteries harvested 7 days after balloon injury from rats treated with (n = 6) or without (n = 3) periadventitial IPA/NO (10 mg).\nIn vitro, 1000 micromol/L IPA/NO inhibited both VSMC (38.7 +/- 4.5% inhibition vs control, P = .003) and endothelial cell proliferation (54.0 +/- 2.9% inhibition vs control, P < or = 0.001) without inducing cell death or inhibiting migration. In VSMC, this inhibition was associated with an S-phase cell cycle arrest and increased expression of cyclin A, cyclin D1, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. No change was noted in the phosphorylation status of cdk2, cdk4, or cdk6 by IPA/NO. In rodents subjected to the carotid artery balloon injury model, IPA/NO caused significant reductions in neointimal area (298 +/- 20 vs 422 +/- 30, P < or = .001) and medial area (311 +/- 14 vs 449 +/- 16, P < or = .001) compared with injury alone, and reduced macrophage infiltration to 1.7 +/- 0.8 from 16.1 +/- 3.5 cells per high power field (P < or = .001). IPA/NO also prevented re-endothelialization compared with injury alone (55.9 +/- 0.5% nonendothelialized vs 21 +/- 4.4%, respectively, P = .001). Lastly, a 50% mortality rate was observed in the IPA/NO-treated groups.\nIn summary, while IPA/NO modestly inhibited neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting VSMC proliferation and macrophage infiltration, it also inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and induced significant mortality in our animal model. Since HNO is being investigated as a treatment for congestive heart failure, our results raise some concerns about the use of IPA/NO in the vasculature and suggest that further studies be conducted on the safety of HNO donors in the cardiovascular system.",

    "abstract": "A 53-year-old woman presented with an iatrogenic right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Approximately 1 year after the cholecystectomy, liver transaminases were elevated, and she complained of recurrent \"crampy\" right upper quadrant pain that radiated posteriorly to her back. Imaging studies demonstrated an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery at the porta hepatis, with possible infiltration into the parenchyma between the right and left lobes of the liver. Selective celiac arteriography showed a 90% stenosis of the right hepatic artery with a large pseudoaneurysm arising from the stenotic segment. This was treated with a 3- x 16-mm stent graft (Jostent; Abbott Vascular, Temecula, Calif) with good result. The completion arteriogram showed wide patency of the stent graft with total exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm. Follow-up serial duplex scans up to 40 months after the procedure showed no evidence of residual pseudoaneurysm and wide patency of the stent graft, with no evidence of focal velocity changes in the right hepatic artery. The patient continues to do well clinically.",

Vascular surgeons and interventionalists, as well as vascular medicine specialists, are uniquely positioned to engage and educate the patient to promote cessation, monitor for continued abstinence, and assist in efforts to avoid relapses.

    "abstract": "Electronic medical records are gathering significant attention with the recent State and Federal initiatives, Medicare Physician Quality Reporting Initiatives (PQRI), and stimulus funds. The conversion to an electronic environment from the comfortable but inefficient paper record can be confusing, difficult, and costly if the practice does not complete the proper analysis and planning for the transformation. Significant monetary assistance is available for practices during this process, with resultant increased practice efficiency and patient safety. To be successful, the practice must fully understand the expected benefits and must evaluate each of the options to be sure the entire practice workflow is considered.",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of patients undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery (LEB) for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) will have cardiovascular or graft-related events. It has been previously demonstrated that systemic inflammation is associated with PAD and its clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that serum biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation would identify a subgroup at elevated risk for graft failure, limb loss, and mortality.\nThis was a prospective longitudinal study of patients (n = 225) undergoing LEB using autogenous vein. Baseline blood samples were obtained prior to surgery in the fasting state. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and the adipokines resistin and high-molecular weight adiponectin (HMWA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Median follow-up was 893 days. The major endpoints of primary patency (PP) and amputation-free survival (AFS) were examined using multivariable methods. Endpoints were screened against biomarkers and patient characteristics for univariate associations. Promising explanatory variables (P < .1) were included in multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.\nThe mean age of subjects was 67.6 years; 71.6% were male and 87.1% were Caucasian. One hundred thirty-three (59.1%) subjects underwent bypass for critical limb ischemia (CLI) and 73 (32.4%) had tissue loss. Patients with CLI and diabetes demonstrated elevated resistin and hsCRP levels. HMWA levels correlated with CLI and with a measure of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) but not with clinical diabetes. Baseline biomarkers were higher in those presenting with tissue loss and in patients with postoperative events (mortality, limb loss). After multivariable analysis (including CLI, diabetes, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], adiponectin, resistin, and CRP), resistin (hazard ratio [HR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.85; P = .025) and CRP (HR 2.39, 95% CI, 1.30-4.39; P = .005) were independently predictive of reduced AFS. However, only resistin maintained its significance when restricted to the diabetic cohort (HR 2.10, 95% CI, 1.10-3.99; P = .025). Higher levels of HMWA were found to be associated with primary graft patency (HR 0.73 for graft failure; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.97; P = .031) in a multivariable model adjusting for diabetes, CRP, African-American race, CLI, high-risk conduits, and redo bypass procedures.\nThese findings suggest that serum biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation may be predictive of clinical outcomes following LEB. Improving the systemic milieu of insulin resistance and inflammation in these high-risk patients may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment of aortic coarctation has increased life expectancy and reduced mortality. Unfortunately, the average lifespan after repair remains only 35 to 50 years, and significant morbidity persists as a result of aneurysm formation, hypertension, accelerated coronary disease, and stroke. Follow-up studies have revealed restenosis rates of 30% and persistent hypertension at rest and during exercise, sometimes with compromised cardiac function. The less invasive nature of nonsurgical repair using transcatheter therapies has led to balloon angioplasty and, recently, stent implantation as an emerging concept for the treatment of aortic coarctation. This review focuses on advances in the management, current indication, and techniques of interventional repair in aortic coarctation.",

After undergoing successful endovascular repair with an aorto-uni-iliac device, unilateral hypogastric artery embolization, and femoral-femoral bypass, he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility neurologically intact with a stage 2 decubitus ulcer. He returned on postoperative day 21 with a large stage 4 septic decubitus ulcer, fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and paraplegia. We hypothesize that the compromised blood flow from the initial reconstruction, combined with the delayed hypotension imposed by sepsis, resulted in spinal cord infarction.

    "abstract": "Critical leg ischemia (CLI) is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic angiogenesis is still being investigated as a possible alternative treatment option for CLI. CXCL12, a chemokine, is known to have two spliced variants, CXCL12alpha and CXCL12beta, but the significance remains unknown. The study investigated the angiogenic effects of CXCL12, protein expressions of CXCL12, and the receptor CXCR4 in human CLI.\nIn vitro, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were used. Cell proliferation was assessed using methylene blue assay and cell count method. Apoptosis was determined by counting the pyknotic nuclei after 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and confirmed by caspase-3 assay. We employed matrigel as capillary tube formation assay. The activity of signaling pathways was measured using Western blotting. In vivo, gastrocnemius biopsies were obtained from the lower limbs of patients with CLI and controls (n = 12 each). Immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence labeling, and Western blotting were then performed.\nCXCL12 attenuated HMEC-1 apoptosis (P < .01), stimulated cell proliferation (P < .05) and capillary tube formation (P < .01). Compared with CXCL12alpha, CXCL12beta has a greater effect on apoptosis and cell proliferation (P < .01). Treatment with both variants resulted in time-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt and p44/42 but not p38 MAP kinase. In CLI, CXCL12alpha was expressed by skeletal muscle fibers with minimal expression of CXCL12beta. CXCR4 was extensively expressed and colocalized to microvessels. A significant 2.6-fold increase in CXCL12alpha and CXCR4 expressions (P < .01) were noted in CLI but not for CXCL12beta (P > .05).\nThe study showed that CXCL12beta had more potent angiogenic properties but was not elevated in human CLI biopsies. This provided an interesting finding on the role of CXCL12 variants in pathophysiologic angiogenic response in CLI.",

Treatment with both variants resulted in time-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt and p44/42 but not p38 MAP kinase. In CLI, CXCL12alpha was expressed by skeletal muscle fibers with minimal expression of CXCL12beta. CXCR4 was extensively expressed and colocalized to microvessels.

    "abstract": "In principle, superiority of computational wall stress analyses compared with the maximum diameter criterion for rupture risk evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been demonstrated. The results of finite element analyses should be evaluated carefully, however, because computational strains and stresses are highly dependent on the quality and complexity of each step of AAA simulation. Most clinically active vascular specialists are not familiar with the processes of computational mechanics to evaluate the quality of AAA simulations. For better understanding and to provide insights in computational biomechanics of AAA, the effect of different computational model assumptions on the results of simulation are explained and demonstrated.\nFour patients with asymptomatic (n = 3) and symptomatic (n = 1) infrarenal AAAs with distinctly different aneurysm morphologies were exemplarily studied. For segmentation and 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of AAA and thrombus, 3-mm computed tomography (CT) slices were used, and a high-density hexahedral element-dominated finite element mesh was generated. Subsequent AAAs were simulated on seven different levels, culminating in the most realistic ortho-pressure-finite element analyses simulations, including thrombus, wall calcifications, and prestress state of AAA geometry with nonlinear hyperelastic material and geometric model assumptions.\nAlterations in displacements due to model assumptions are up to 740% for a specific aneurysm. The average maximum discrepancy among the four morphologies between simple and advanced models is 607%. Differences in peak wall stress between simple and realistic models are up to 210% individually and 170% on average.\nDifferences of model assumptions are more important for simulation results than differences between patient-specific morphologies. Because the biomechanical behavior of AAA is nonlinear in many senses, comparisons between individual morphologies and statistics are only valid when detailed information about preconditions and model assumptions is provided.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is a major risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and PAD is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the combined effects of smoking and PAD on all-cause and CVD mortality.\nA total of 1979 males 35 years of age or older were enrolled from eight university-affiliated hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai in 2004, with both smoking status and PAD diagnosis obtained, 1712 of them had complete follow-up data. Mortality data were obtained from all participants between December 2007 and February 2008. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate relative risks (RRs) of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality among different groups.\nAt baseline, the average age of participants was 66.98-years-old (SD = 11.57), prevalence of PAD was 24.0% and 65.4% smoked cigarettes. During the 3-year follow-up, all-cause cumulative mortality rates were 27.9% (PAD/smoker), 26.3% (PAD/nonsmoker), 14.1% (no PAD/smoker), and 14.4% (no PAD/nonsmoker) (P < .001), and CVD cumulative mortality rates were 17.8%, 14.9%, 8.1%, and 7.3%, respectively (P < .001). Compared with the no PAD/nonsmoker subjects, adjusted RR from all-cause mortality in the groups of both PAD/smoker, PAD/nonsmoker, and no PAD/smoker were 1.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-2.64), 1.37 (95% CI, 0.85-2.23), and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.79-1.49), respectively. The adjusted RR from CVD mortality was 2.12 (95% CI, 1.37-3.28), 1.55 (95% CI, 0.84-2.86), and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.74-1.71), respectively.\nPAD is a major determinant of mortality.

The aim of the present study was to assess independent risk factors for AE occurrence: patient, disease and operation characteristics besides general differences between health care facilities.\nAll AEs after infrainguinal bypass graft procedures (BGPs) in three health care facilities in the Netherlands were evaluated. AEs were defined identically in the facilities.\nOf 601 BGPs performed, 662 AEs were registered. Independent predictors of AEs were female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-3.26; P < .01), age >or=60 years (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.95; P = .03), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification 3-4 (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.01-3.17; P = .05), comorbidities of pulmonary disease (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.67-5.34; P < .01) and diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.58-3.94; P < .01), distal anastomosis level at below knee femoropopliteal BGP (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.26-3.22; P < .01), femorotibial BGP (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.37-4.19; P < .01), and popliteopedal BGP (OR, 92.39; 95% CI, 11.13-766.98; P < .01). One health care facility had significantly fewer AEs than the other two (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.13-0.35; P < .01).\nAge, gender, comorbidity, and type of surgery are all independent predictors of AE occurrence in vascular surgery. After adjustment for differences in these factors, one health care facility still had lower AE occurrence, which needs to be examined further.",

Patients were assessed on large artery elasticity index (LAEI), small artery elasticity index (SAEI), age, weight, body mass index, ankle-brachial index (ABI), smoking status, and metabolic syndrome components.\nGroup differences were found for LAEI (P = .042), SAEI (P = .019), body mass index (P = .020), prevalence of elevated fasting glucose (P = .001), and prevalence of abdominal obesity (P = .025). Significant covariates for LAEI included age (P = .0002) and elevated triglycerides (P = .0719).

    "abstract": "Blunt carotid injury (BCI) is uncommon but potentially devastating. The best treatment modality for this injury remains undetermined. We conducted this study to better understand the hospital course and treatment outcomes for patients with BCI who received different interventions.\nBCI and related vascular procedures were identified by ICD-9-CM codes from the National Trauma Data Bank(1) using data gathered from 2002 to 2006. Conservative and operative treatment groups were compared by variables of patient demographics, initial assessment in the emergency department (ED), hospital course, and treatment outcomes. Open surgical and endovascular interventions were further compared.\nA total of 842 BCI were identified from 1,633,126 discharged blunt trauma patients (0.05%). Of these, 762 (90.5%) were treated conservatively and 80 (9.5%) received operative intervention. No differences in demographics were observed between these treatment groups. On initial assessment, no differences between conservative and operative treatment groups were noted with regard to vital signs, Glasgow coma scale, presence of drugs or alcohol in blood, or Trauma Related Injury Severity Score survival probability. Significant differences were seen in terms of the presence of a base deficit (-3.1 +/- 6.8 vs -7.6 +/- 8.3; P = .01), likelihood of a positive head computed tomography (CT) scan (58.6% vs 26.1%; P = .003), and total Injury Severity Score (29.8 +/- 13.3 vs 26.1 +/- 14.1; P = .02). Hospital course and treatment outcomes were comparable, with no differences in hospital length of stay (13.4 +/- 15.3 days vs 13.7 +/- 13.6 days; P = .86), total Functional Independence Measure (8.8 +/- 3.3 vs 9.3 +/- 3.1; P = .38), progression of original neurologic insult (7.5% vs 4.6%; P = .61) or mortality (28.1% vs 19%; P = .08). When comparing open surgical to endovascular interventions (46 open, 34 endovascular, including 3 combined), the only significant differences were in the total Injury Severity Score (22.4 +/- 12.2 vs 31.4 +/- 15.4; P = .01) and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay (5.0 +/- 6.0 days vs 10.7 +/- 10.4 days; P = .01, and 10.3 +/- 9.2 days vs 19.3 +/- 17.7 days; P = .01). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that neither Functional Independence Measure (FIM) nor mortality was associated with conservative or operative treatment.\nBCI is rare and carries a poor prognosis. Operative intervention is not associated with functional improvement or a survival advantage. This study was unable to support that less invasive endovascular treatment improves treatment outcome when compared to open surgery.",

    "abstract": "The pivotal trial of the Talent enhanced Low Profile System (eLPS; Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) stent graft evaluated short and long-term safety and efficacy of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). These data and a confirmatory group assessing the performance of the CoilTrac delivery system supported the United States premarket approval application for the device.\nThe pivotal trial was a prospective, nonrandomized study conducted at 13 sites from February 2002 to April 2003. The study group (n = 166) underwent EVAR using the Talent eLPS stent graft. The control group (n = 243) underwent open surgical AAA repair. Data for this group were obtained from the Society for Vascular Surgery Endovascular AAA Surgical Controls project. Outcomes were compared at 30 days and 12 months. Additional 5-year follow-up was obtained for the eLPS group. A single-center cohort of 137 patients was the confirmatory group for the assessment of the clinical performance of the CoilTrac delivery system, with analysis of outcomes <or=30 days from the procedure.\nAAA anatomy with neck length as short as 3 mm and maximum neck diameter of 32 mm were included in the eLPS group. EVAR was superior to open repair for periprocedural outcomes, including mean procedure duration (167.3 vs 196.4 minutes, P < .001), blood transfusion (18.2% vs 56.8%, P < .001), median intensive care unit stay (19.3 vs 74.3 hours, P < .001), and mean hospital stay (3.6 vs 8.2 days, P < .001). Freedom from major adverse events was 89.2% for EVAR at 30 days vs 44.0% (P < .001) and 81.3% vs 42.4% at 1 year (P < .001). Freedom from all-cause mortality and aneurysm-related mortality (ARM) was 93.7% and 98.2% for EVAR vs 92.4% and 96.7% for the controls. Through 5 years for the EVAR group, rates of freedom from all-cause mortality, ARM, aneurysm rupture, and conversion to surgery were 69.8%, 96.5%, 98.2%, and 99.1%, respectively, with one conversion to surgery, 25 secondary reinterventions, and five site-reported instances of stent graft migration. The technical success rate for the CoilTrac confirmatory group was 100%, with no aneurysm rupture or conversion to open repair at 30 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1.5% (2 of 137).\nIn a population with challenging anatomic characteristics, EVAR with the Talent eLPS and use of the CoilTrac delivery system compared favorably with open repair through 1 year. Sustained protection from ARM, with minimal reinterventions, was attained through 5 years.",

Through 5 years for the EVAR group, rates of freedom from all-cause mortality, ARM, aneurysm rupture, and conversion to surgery were 69.8%, 96.5%, 98.2%, and 99.1%, respectively, with one conversion to surgery, 25 secondary reinterventions, and five site-reported instances of stent graft migration. The technical success rate for the CoilTrac confirmatory group was 100%, with no aneurysm rupture or conversion to open repair at 30 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1.5% (2 of 137).",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the significance of blood transfusion in patients with peripheral arterial disease. We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database to examine the effect of intraoperative blood transfusion on the morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization.\nWe analyzed data from the participant use data file containing vascular surgical cases submitted to the ACS NSQIP in 2005, 2006, and 2007 by 173 hospitals. Current procedural terminology codes were used to select lower extremity procedures that were grouped into venous graft, prosthetic graft, or thromboendarterectomy. Thirty-day outcomes analyzed were (1) mortality, (2) composite morbidity, (3) graft/prosthesis failure, (4) return to the operating room within 30 days, (5) wound occurrences, (6) sepsis or septic shock, (7) pulmonary occurrences, and (8) renal insufficiency or failure. Intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells was categorized as none, 1 to 2 units, and 3 or more units. Outcome rates were compared between the transfused and nontransfused groups using the chi(2) test and multivariable regression adjusting for transfusion propensity, comorbid and procedural risk.\nA total of 8799 patients underwent lower extremity revascularization between 2005 and 2007. Mean age was 66.8 +/- 12.0 years and 5569 (63.3%) were male. Transfusion rates ranged from 14.5% in thromboendarterectomy patients to 27.1% in prosthetic bypass patients (P < .05). After adjustment for transfusion propensity and patient and procedural risks, transfusion of 1 or 2 units remained significantly predictive of mortality, composite morbidity, sepsis/shock, pulmonary occurrences, and return to the operating room. The adjusted odds ratios for 30-day mortality ranged from 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.70) for 1 to 2 units to 2.48 (95% CI 1.55-3.98) for 3 or more units.\nIn a large number of patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, we have found that there is a higher risk of postoperative mortality, pulmonary, and infectious complications after receiving intraoperative blood transfusion. Additional studies are necessary to better define transfusion triggers that balance the risk/benefit ratio for blood transfusion.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the safety and effectiveness of a novel thrombolytic, alfimeprase, in catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) of acute peripheral arterial occlusions (PAO).\nBetween April 2005 and March 2007, patients with acute PAO (Rutherford class I or IIa) of a lower extremity and onset of symptoms within 14 days prior to randomization were included. Studies HA004 and HA007 enrolled respectively 300 and 102 patients. Both studies HA004 and HA007 were placebo-controlled. HA004 had two placebo arms, intrathrombus and perithrombus, while HA007 had intrathrombus placebo arm. HA004 was partially double-blind (perithrombus group was not blinded) and HA007 was double-blind. Patients were randomized to intrathrombus alfimeprase (0.3 mg/kg), intrathrombus (IT) placebo, or perithrombus (PT) placebo (HA004 only) in two divided weight-based infusions 2 hours apart. Depending on arteriographic results after treatment, patients received no further intervention or underwent endovascular therapy or open vascular surgery. The primary endpoint of both studies was efficacy of alfimeprase compared with placebo as measured by avoidance of an open vascular surgery procedure at 30 days.\nThe avoidance of open vascular surgery at 30 days was seen in 52 (34.9%), 42 (37.2%), and 7 patients (18.4%) with alfimeprase, IT placebo, and PT placebo in HA004 and 15 (29.4%) and 9 patients (17.6%) with alfimeprase and IT placebo in HA007; differences between alfimeprase and IT placebo were not statistically significant. Results were similar for secondary endpoints, including arterial flow restoration in 4 hours, 30-day ankle-brachial index, index limb pain severity, and hospital stay duration. The overall rate of adverse events was higher with alfimeprase than placebo. Hemorrhagic and peripheral embolic event rates with alfimeprase were 23% (34 patients) and 10.1% (15 patients) in HA004 and 9.4% (5 patients) and 9.8% (5 patients) in HA007; rates with IT placebo were 11% (12 patients, P = .107) and 5% (5 patients, P = .148) in HA004 and 10% (5 patients, P = .982) and 0% in HA007 (P = .07). No deaths were related to study drug administration.\nCDT for acute PAO with alfimeprase was as safe as placebo. However, alfimeprase was no more effective than placebo in increasing 30-day surgery-free survival. The surprising effectiveness of placebo alone demonstrates that the inclusion of a placebo arm is essential to the design of future lytic trials.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the outcome of ruptured juxtarenal aortic aneurysm (RJAA) repair. Surgical treatment of RJAAs requires suprarenal aortic cross-clamping, which causes additional renal ischemia-reperfusion injury on top of the pre-existing hypovolemic shock syndrome. As endovascular alternatives rarely exist in this situation, open repair continues to be the gold standard. We analyzed our results of open RJAA repair during an 11-year period.\nRetrospective observational study.\nBetween July 1997 and December 2008, all consecutive patients with RJAAs were included in the study. Part of these patients received cold perfusion of the kidneys during suprarenal aortic cross-clamping. Perioperative variables, morbidity, and 30-day or in-hospital mortality were assessed. Renal insufficiency was defined as an acute rise of >or=0.5 mg/dL in serum creatinine level. Multiple organ failure (MOF) was scored using the sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score).\nA total of 29 consecutive patients with an RJAA, confirmed by computed tomography-scanning, presented to our hospital. In eight patients, the operation was aborted before the start of aortic repair, because no blood pressure could be regained in spite of maximal resuscitation measures. They were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 21 patients, 10 died during hospital stay. Renal insufficiency occurred in 11 out of 21 of the patients. Eleven out of 21 patients developed MOF postoperatively. In a subgroup of patients who received renal cooling during suprarenal aortic clamping, the 30-day or in-hospital mortality was two of 10 vs eight of 11 in patients who did not receive renal cooling (P = .03); renal insufficiency occurred in one out of 10 patients in the subgroup with renal cooling vs 10 out of 11 without renal cooling (P < .001) and MOF in two of 10 vs nine of 11, respectively (P = .009).\nOpen surgical repair of RJAAs is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cold perfusion of the kidneys during RJAA repair. Although numbers are small, a beneficial effect of renal cooling on the outcome of RJAA repair is suggested, warranting further research with this technique.",

    "abstract": "Takayasu arteritis (TA) is an immune-mediated disease with an unknown etiology. Assessment of disease activity in patients with TA is challenging owing to the absence of reliable serologic markers. Because circulation levels of acute-phase proteins fluctuate with the severity and extent of the inflammatory reaction, they may be potential biomarkers for the identification of TA activity. To test this hypothesis, certain acute-phase proteins were examined in TA patients and controls.\nThe study included 43 prospectively selected TA patients, with 18 in active phase and 25 in inactive phase. The Sharma modified criteria were used for disease diagnosis, and the National Institutes of Health criteria were used for TA activity assessment. Circulation levels of acute-phase proteins, including serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen, complement C4-binding protein (C4BP), C-reactive protein, serum amyloid P, haptoglobin, alpha-acid glycoprotein, transthyretin, alpha1-microglobin, and complement fraction C3c and C4a were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in each participant.\nCirculating levels of SAA and C4BP were significantly increased in active TA patients compared with inactive TA patients and in controls, with (SAA: 95.9 [interquartile range, 51.9] vs 49.2 [82.0], P = .009; and 23.9 [50.1] mg/L, P = .001, respectively; C4BP: 88.5 [72.6] vs 61.7 [57.7], P = .023; and 32.6 [32.1] mg/L, P < .001, respectively).

No difference was found in the levels of the other acute-phase proteins studied.\nSAA and C4BP may be useful biomarkers in determining the disease activity of TA. More work should be done to test these results in a large cohort of patients in a longitudinal manner.",

Little data exist, however, describing the technique of PV/SMV reconstruction, patency of such reconstructions, and the morbidity of using lower extremity veins for PV/SMV reconstruction during pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nThirty-four patients underwent PV/SMV reconstruction during pancreaticoduodenectomy using lower extremity vein. The saphenous vein was preferred for patching and femoral vein for replacement. We analyzed preoperative imaging, reconstruction patency, vein harvest morbidity, and late mortality.\nThe mean age was 62.6 years. All 34 patients had preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging and/or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) scan. Fourteen of the 34 patients had evidence of PV/SMV invasion on CT or EUS scans, 14 did not, and six studies were indeterminate. Twenty-five patients had follow-up imaging, and 22 (88%) had patent reconstructions. Fifteen patients had PV/SMV replacement using femoral vein. Seven of these 15 had minor postoperative lower extremity edema that resolved over time, five had wound complications from the femoral vein harvest site, three of which required minor operative procedures for treatment. Fifteen patients had PV/SMV patching with the great saphenous vein, none had postoperative wound problems, and one had minimal postoperative lower extremity edema. Four patients had PV/SMV patching using femoral vein, none had postoperative wound problems, and one had minimal postoperative lower extremity edema. Compared with patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy without PV/SMV reconstruction, by Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no difference in late mortality.\nPreoperative imaging may fail to detect PV/SMV involvement in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The PV/SMV reconstruction with leg vein provides good patency with minimal postoperative lower extremity complications and no increase in late mortality. The lower extremities should be routinely included in the operative field of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.",

    "abstract": "Since the publication of Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines, the use of native veins for the construction of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) for hemodialysis has been highly recommended rather than prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVG). Upper arm basilic vein transposition (BVT) has been accepted widely, with superior patency compared with AVG, but only a few studies have reported outcomes of forearm BVT (FBVT). This study evaluated the efficacy of FBVT compared with direct AVF (DAVF) and AVG in a tertiary referral center.\nFrom January 2005 to December 2007, 461 patients underwent AV access for hemodialysis in Seoul National University Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and dialysis sheets and evaluated the current AVF function in the outpatient clinic or by telephone interviews. Patients were grouped by the operation type: DAVF, FBVT, and AVG. The outcomes compared were primary, assisted-primary and secondary patency rates, maturation failure, and complications.\nThe mean age was 59 years (range, 14-92 years), and 280 patients (60.7%) were male. By operation type, the 461 accesses were 389 DAVF (84.4%), 34 FBVT (7.4%), and 38 AVG (8.2%). Mean follow-up duration was 21 months (range, 1-51 months). The primary patency rates for DAVF, FBVT, and AVG were 67.6%, 41.5%, 35% at 12 months and 53.9%, 30.2%, 10.3% at 24 months, respectively. The secondary patency rates were 89.2%, 79.1%, 78.3% at 12 months and 83.8%, 74.4%, 64.9% at 24 months, respectively. Maturation failure occurred in five DAVF patients and in one FBVT patient. The infection rate was 0.3% in DAVF and 12.5% in AVG, but no infection occurred in patients with FBVT. Multivariate analysis revealed that age and history of previous access were associated with lower primary patency.\nForearm BVT showed an acceptable, high 2-year patency rate and fewer thromboses and infectious complications than AVG. Forearm BVT could be considered before forming an upper arm AVF or forearm AVG, if the basilic vein is available.",

    "abstract": "High serum levels of estradiol are associated with clinical evidence of varicose veins in women; however, the relationship between serum sex steroid hormones and varicose veins in men is unclear. To address this issue, serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, and androstenedione were determined in the great saphenous (GSV) and cubital veins of men with varicose veins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of sex steroid hormones, metabolizing enzymes, and their receptors was investigated in tissue samples of leg veins.\nThis prospective study included 40 men, comprising 20 with varicose veins and reflux of the GSV (VM) and 20 with healthy veins (HM). All limbs were assessed by duplex ultrasound scanning of selected superficial and deep leg veins. Blood samples were taken from the cubital vein and from the GSV. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for sex steroid hormones, their metabolizing enzymes, and receptors in saphenous veins was performed in tissue samples of varicose (n = 6) and healthy veins (n = 6).\nThe VM group had significantly higher (P < .001) mean levels for serum testosterone (44.9 nmol/L; range, 8.8-225.1) and estradiol (242.2 pmol/L; range, 79-941) in varicose saphenous veins compared with cubital veins (testosterone, 15.5 nmol/L; range, 8.4-23.3; estradiol, 93.2 pmol/L; range, 31-147). Moreover, significantly (P < .001) higher mean serum estradiol levels (133.2 pmol/L; range, 63-239) were detected in the saphenous veins of the HM group compared with cubital veins (88.15 pmol/L; range, 37-153). Both groups had similar blood counts and serum androstenedione levels in the upper and lower extremity. Interestingly, qRT-PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of 5alpha-reductase type 1, 5alpha-reductase type 2, 17, 20 lyase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD), aromatase and 3beta-HSD type 2, androgen and estrogen receptor 1 was down-regulated (P < .05) in all samples of varicose veins vs veins obtained from healthy men.\nElevated serum estradiol and testosterone levels were detected in men with varicose veins and reflux in the GSV compared with the patient's own arm veins. Enzymes and hormonal receptors involved in steroid metabolism were down-regulated in patients with GSV reflux and varicose veins, suggestive of a negative feedback regulation. These data support the notion of a possible causal relationship between sex steroids and varicose veins in men.",

    "abstract": "Two large randomized trials showed that elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) had similar all-cause long-term mortality rates but increased costs compared with open repair for nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Despite these data, the use of EVAR continues to increase in North America. Currently, there are very limited adjusted population-based data examining long-term outcomes and resource utilization.\nAll patients who underwent elective AAA repair between April 2002 and March 2007 in Ontario were identified using data from hospital discharge abstracts. Patients were identified with a validated algorithm. A propensity score analysis was used to adjust for treatment allocation. Clinical outcomes included time to all-cause death and discharge to a nursing home or long-term care facility. Resource utilization outcomes included imaging utilization, hospital utilization, and reintervention rates.\nOverall, 6461 patients underwent treatment of nonruptured AAAs, comprising 888 EVARs and 5573 open repairs. EVAR patients were older and had more comorbidities. The adjusted mortality was significantly lower in the EVAR group at 30 days (adjusted odds ratio [adj-OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.20-0.59), but long-term mortality was similar (adj-OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.05).

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery training has evolved from a single clinical year after general surgery training to a multi-year training program to encompass such entities as noninvasive vascular laboratory, office-based procedures, and endovascular techniques. Simultaneously, members of the vascular surgery community have had to undergo significant training to become facile with endovascular techniques. We surveyed vascular surgery trainees on the online Vascular Surgery In-Training Examination (VSITE) in 2008 and 2009 to assess who trained them in percutaneous techniques.\nVascular surgery trainees in the Independent (2-year) and Integrated (5-year) training programs were asked to participate in a survey upon completion of the VSITE in 2008 and 2009. Examinees were asked to select whether vascular surgeons, cardiologists, or interventional radiologists trained them in carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS), thoracic endografts (TEVAR), endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), renal artery intervention, iliac stenting, superficial femoral artery (SFA), and tibial artery percutaneous interventions.\nSurvey response rate was 79.6% (191 of 240). Results of the survey are shown in Table I. In 2009, vascular surgeons provided more than 84% of the training to vascular surgery residents. Only six respondents had >50% of their percutaneous training with interventional radiology and two with cardiologists.\nVascular surgeons involved in resident education have been able to retrain themselves in endovascular techniques such that they are now able to provide greater than 80% of the endovascular experience to vascular surgery residents.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic thoracic aortic injury (TTAI) is associated with high mortality rates. Data supporting thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to reduce mortality and morbidity for TTAI is limited to small series and meta-analyses. In this study, we evaluated the trends and outcomes of open surgery and TEVAR for TTAI in New York State.\nAll cases of TTAI in New York State between 2000 and 2007 were extracted from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database. A diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision coding of TTAI was required for inclusion.\nWe identified 328 patients with TTAI who underwent surgical repair in New York State between 2000 and 2007; mean age of the cohort was 39.3 years +/- 18 years; 80% were male. Open repair of TTAI was performed in 79.6% and 20.4% underwent TEVAR. Open repair was performed for all cases of TTAI until the introduction of TEVAR in 2005; TEVAR exceeded the use of open repair for TTAI in 2006 and 2007. Additional major injuries were present in 71.7% in the open repair group vs 91.0% of the TEVAR group (P = .001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate for the 8-year period was significantly increased after open repair of TTAI compared with TEVAR: 17% vs 6%, (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-9.23; P = .024). After controlling for the significant covariates, TEVAR independently reduced the risk of death following surgical intervention for TTAI compared with the open procedure (OR 3.8, 95% CI, 1.28-10.99; P = .010). Respiratory complications were the most common postoperative morbidity, and were significantly increased after open repair: 38% vs 24% (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.05-3.60; P = .032). There were no significant differences in cardiac complications, acute renal failure (ARF), paraplegia, or stroke. Endoleak and distal embolization each occurred in 9% of patients after TEVAR.\nThere has been a shift toward endovascular management of patients with TTAI. This change in surgical strategy has been associated with less postoperative mortality and fewer pulmonary complications in patients suffering from TTAI. TEVAR is associated with significant device-related complications.",

    "abstract": "Subclinical alterations of cerebral function can occur during or after carotid revascularization and can be detected by a variety of standard tests. This comparative study assessed the relationship among serum levels for two biochemical markers of cerebral injury, postoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), and neuropsychometric testing in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) for high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis.\nForty-three consecutive asymptomatic patients underwent carotid revascularization by endarterectomy (CEA, 20) or stenting (CAS, 23). They were evaluated with DW-MRI and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test preoperatively and <or=24 hours after carotid revascularization. Venous blood samples to assess serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100beta protein were collected for each patient preoperatively and five times in a 24-hour period postoperatively and assayed using automated commercial equipment. The MMSE test was repeated at 6 months. The relationship between serum marker levels and neuropsychometric and imaging tests and differences between the two groups of patients were analyzed by chi(2) test, with significance at P < .05.\nNo transient ischemic attacks or strokes were clinically observed. CAS caused more new subcortical lesions at postoperative DW-MRI and a significant decline in the MMSE postoperative score compared with CEA (P = .03). In CAS patients, new lesions at DW-MRI were significantly associated with a postoperative MMSE score decline >5 points (P = .001). Analysis of S100beta and NSE levels showed a significant increase at 24 hours in CAS patients compared with CEA patients (P = .02). The MMSE score at 6 months showed a nonsignificant increase vs the postoperative score in both groups.\nBiochemical markers measurements of brain damage combined with neuropsychometric tests and DW-MRI can be used to evaluate silent injuries after CAS. The mechanisms of rise in S100beta and NSE levels at 24 hours after CAS may be due to increased perioperative microembolization rather than to hypoperfusion. Further studies are required to assess the clinical significance of those tests in carotid revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Venous leg ulcers (VLU) have a huge social and economic impact. An estimated 1.5% of European adults will suffer a venous ulcer at some point in their lives. Despite the widespread use of bandaging with high pressure in the treatment of this condition, recurrence rates range between 25% to 70%. Numerous studies have suggested that the compression system should provide sub-bandage pressure values in the range from 35 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg in order to achieve the best possible healing results.\nAn open, randomized, prospective, single-center study was performed in order to determine the healing rates of VLU when treated with different compression systems and different sub-bandage pressure values. One hundred thirty-one patients (72 women, 59 men; mean age, 59-years-old) with VLU (ulcer surface >3 cm(2); duration >3 months) were randomized into three groups: group A - 42 patients who were treated using an open-toed, elastic, class III compression device knitted in tubular form (Tubulcus, Laboratoires Innothera, Arcueil, France); group B - 46 patients treated with the multi-component bandaging system comprised of Tubulcus and one elastic bandage (15 cm wide and 5 cm long with 200% stretch, Niva, Novi Sad, Serbia); and group C - forty-three patients treated with the multi-component bandaging system comprised of Tubulcus and two elastic bandages. Pressure measurements were taken with the Kikuhime device (TT MediTrade, Soro, Denmark) at the B1 measuring point in the supine, sitting, and standing positions under the three different compression systems.\nThe median resting values in the supine and standing positions in examined study groups were as follows: group A - 36.2 mm Hg and 43.9 mm Hg; group B - 53.9 mm Hg and 68.2 mm Hg; group C - 74.0 mm Hg and 87.4 mm Hg. The healing rate during the 26-week treatment period was 25% (13/42) in group A, 67.4% (31/46) in group B, and 74.4% (32/43) in group C. The success of compression treatment in group A was strongly associated with the small ulcer surface (<5 cm(2)) and smaller calf circumference (CC; <38 cm). On the other hand, compliance in group A was good. In groups B and C, compliance was poor in patients with small CC, but the healing rate was high, especially in patients with large ulcers and a large CC (>43 cm).\nThe results obtained in this study indicate that better healing results are achieved with two or multi-component compression systems than with single-component compression systems and that a compression system should be individually determined for each patient according to individual characteristics of the leg and CC. Target sub-bandage pressure value (B1 measuring point in the sitting position) of the compression system needed for the ulcer healing could be determined according to a simple formula, CC + CC/2.",

The success of compression treatment in group A was strongly associated with the small ulcer surface (<5 cm(2)) and smaller calf circumference (CC; <38 cm). On the other hand, compliance in group A was good. In groups B and C, compliance was poor in patients with small CC, but the healing rate was high, especially in patients with large ulcers and a large CC (>43 cm).",

    "abstract": "Varicose veins and other vascular abnormalities are common clinical entities. Treatment options include vein stripping, sclerotherapy, and endovenous laser treatment, but all involve some degree of invasive intervention. The purpose of this study was to determine ex vivo the effectiveness of a novel hand-held, battery-operated, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device for transcutaneous venous ablation.\nThe ultrasound device is 14 x 9 x 4 cm, weighs 650 g, and is powered by 4 lithium ion battery packs. An ex vivo testing platform consisting of two different models comprised of sequentially layered skin-muscle-vein or skin-fat-vein was developed, and specimens were treated with HIFU. The tissues were then disassembled, imaged, and processed for histology. The luminal cross-sectional area of vein that had been treated with HIFU and nontreated controls were measured, and the values presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The values were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and statistical significance was set at P < .05.\nOn gross and histologic examination, veins that had been treated with HIFU showed evidence of coagulation necrosis. The surface of the muscle in direct contact with the vein had a pinpoint area of coagulation, whereas the adjacent fat appeared undisturbed; the skin, fat, and the surface of the muscle in contact with the transducer remained completely unaffected. The cross-sectional area was 3.79 mm(2) (IQR, 3.38-4.22) of the control vein lumen and 0.16 mm(2) (IQR, 0.04-0.39) in those that had been treated with HIFU (P = .0304).\nThis inexpensive, portable HIFU device has the potential to allow clinicians to easily perform venous ablation in a manner that is entirely noninvasive and without the expense or inconvenience of large, complicated devices. This device represents a significant step forward in the development of new applications for HIFU technology.",

    "abstract": "Controversy persists regarding the use of protamine during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) based on prior conflicting reports documenting both reduced bleeding as well as increased stroke risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation on the outcome of CEA in a contemporary multistate registry.\nWe reviewed a prospective regional registry of 4587 CEAs in 4311 patients performed by 66 surgeons from 11 centers in Northern New England from 2003-2008. Protamine use varied by surgeon (38% routine use, 44% rare use, 18% selective use). Endpoints were postoperative bleeding requiring reoperation as well as potential thrombotic complications, including stroke, death, and myocardial infarction (MI). Predictors of endpoints were determined by multivariate logistic regression after associated variables were identified by univariate analysis.\nOf the 4587 CEAs performed, 46% utilized protamine, while 54% did not. Fourteen patients (0.64%) in the protamine-treated group required reoperation for bleeding compared with 42 patients (1.66%) in the untreated cohort (P = .001). Protamine use did not affect the rate of MI (1.1% vs 0.91%, P = .51), stroke (0.78% vs 1.15%, P = .2), or death (0.23% vs 0.32%, P = .57) between treated and untreated patients, respectively. By multivariate analysis, protamine (odds ratio [OR] 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.63; P = .001) and patch angioplasty (OR 0.46, 95% CI, 0.26-0.81; P = .007) were independently associated with diminished reoperation for bleeding. A single center was associated with a significantly higher rate of reoperation for bleeding (OR 6.47, 95% CI, 3.02-13.9; P < .001). Independent of protamine use, consequences of reoperation for bleeding were significant, with a four-fold increase in MI, a seven-fold increase in stroke, and a 30-fold increase in death.\nProtamine reduced serious bleeding requiring reoperation during CEA without increasing the risk of MI, stroke, or death, in this large, contemporary registry. In light of significant complications referable to bleeding, liberal use of protamine during CEA appears warranted.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major source of postoperative morbidity and mortality and is currently a major quality improvement initiative. Mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis is effective in preventing postoperative thromboembolic events, yet it remains underutilized in the clinical setting. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop and implement a computerized DVT risk assessment program in the electronic medical record and determine its effect on compliance with DVT prophylaxis guidelines.\nA standardized DVT risk assessment program was developed and incorporated into the Computerized Patient Record System for all surgical patients at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Four hundred consecutive surgical patients before and after implementation were evaluated for DVT risk, the prescription of pharmacological and mechanical DVT prophylaxis, and the development of thromboembolic events.\nWith implementation of the DVT risk assessment program, the number of patients receiving the recommended pharmacological prophylaxis preoperatively more than doubled (14% to 36%) (P < .001), and use of sequential compression devices (SCD) increased 40% (P < .001). Overall, the percentage of at-risk patients receiving the recommended combined DVT prophylaxis of SCD and pharmacological prophylaxis increased nearly seven-fold (5% to 32%) (P < .001). The assessment also improved use of prophylaxis postoperatively, increasing SCD use by 27% (P < .001). With respect to DVT occurrence, there was an 80% decrease in the incidence of postoperative DVT at 30 days and a 36% decrease at 90 days; however, this did not reach statistical significance due to the low event rate.\nThe creation and implementation of a standardized DVT risk assessment program in the electronic medical record significantly increased use of pharmacological and mechanical DVT prophylaxis before surgery in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center setting.",

Two patients underwent combined thoracoabdominal aneurysm treatment with branched stent grafts, and one underwent combined juxtarenal aneurysm repair with a fenestrated device. The helical iliac side branch device was used in 11 CIAA (23.4%), and the Zenith bifurcated iliac side branch device was used in the remaining 36 (76.6%).\nThe technical success rate was 97.3% within the 47 intended-to-treat CIAAs (failure to introduce the delivery system in one case, converted to femorofemoral bypass). During follow-up, five (10.6%) hypogastric branch occlusions occurred in five patients. Two patients with bilateral repair had unilateral internal iliac artery side branch occlusions without ischemic symptoms. In contrast, of the three patients with unilateral side branch occlusion and simultaneous contralateral internal iliac artery occlusion (2 chronic and 1 coil embolization), persistent buttock claudication and sexual dysfunction developed in one. The secondary patency, including one redo case, was 87.3% at 22 months (standard error <10%).\nThe use of branched stent grafts is a feasible procedure, including for patients with bilateral iliac aneurysmal disease or concomitant juxtarenal or thoracoabdominal aortic disease.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade, there has been a sharp increase in the number of vascular procedures performed in the United States. Due to the increase in the size of the aging population, this trend is predicted to continue. Despite this, general public knowledge about vascular surgery appears low. This gap may significantly affect the success of vascular surgery as a specialty. To objectively define knowledge about vascular surgery, we administered a questionnaire to both a sample of the general population and medical students. The Vascular Surgery Knowledge Questionnaire (VSQ), a 58-item multiple choice survey, was designed to assess knowledge about the field of vascular surgery, including types of procedures commonly performed, presenting illnesses, training, and financial compensation. VSQ was tested for reliability and validity. It was administered to a sample of the general population (GP) and first year medical students (MS) via a random digit dial telephone survey and a paper-based survey, respectively. VSQ Score was derived by calculating the percent of questions from the 38-item, non-demographic part of the questionnaire answered correctly and expressed in numerical form. The maximum score possible was 100. Statistical analysis was used to assess differences in VSQ scores. Two hundred GP and 160 MS subjects completed the questionnaire. The mean VSQ score for GP and MS groups was 54 and 67 (P < .01), respectively. Forty-one percent of the GP group received a score of less than 50. Only 50% of the GP and 51% of MS cohorts agreed with the statement that vascular surgeons perform procedures on all blood vessels with the exception of the heart and brain. Just 24% of the GP group agreed with the statement that vascular surgeons treat patients with wounds that do not heal. Finally, only half of the GP group agreed that vascular surgeons treat patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The GP cohort significantly underestimated the average length of postgraduate training (five years) to become a vascular surgeon. Level of education, income, and residence in the Western states significantly correlated with higher scores. General population subjects who admitted to knowing a vascular surgeon received similar scores to those who did not (58 vs. 53, P >.05). These findings support our hypothesis that there is a significant knowledge deficit among both the general population and medical students about the field of vascular surgery. This has protean implications for the future of our specialty and public health in the United States.",

    "abstract": "For patients with the most severe manifestations of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease, bypass surgery using autogenous vein has been the most durable reconstruction. However, the incidence of bypass graft stenosis and graft failure remains substantial and wholesale improvements in patency are lacking. One potential explanation is that stenosis arises not only from over exuberant intimal hyperplasia, but also due to insufficient adaptation or remodeling of the vein to the arterial environment. Although in vivo human studies are difficult to conduct, recent advances in imaging technology have made possible a more comprehensive structural examination of vein bypass maturation. This review summarizes recent translational efforts to understand the structural and functional properties of human vein grafts and places it within the context of the rich existing literature of vein graft failure.",

After unsuccessful use of the endovascular antegrade approach, retrograde revascularization with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the ulnar artery and the Palmar arch through the radial artery was successfully performed (the radial to ulnar artery loop technique). Relief of the patient's symptoms was immediate and ischemic lesions were healed at 6-month follow-up.

    "abstract": "Studies of infrainguinal lower extremity bypass for critical limb ischemia (CLI) have traditionally emphasized outcomes of patency, limb salvage, and death. Because functional outcomes are equally important, our objectives were to describe the proportion of CLI patients who did not achieve symptomatic improvement 1 year after bypass, despite having patent grafts, and identify preoperative factors associated with this outcome.\nThe prospectively collected Vascular Study Group of Northern New England database was used to identify all patients with elective infrainguinal lower extremity bypass for CLI (2003 to 2007) for whom long-term follow-up data were available. The primary composite study end point was clinical failure at 1 year after bypass, defined as amputation or persistent or worsened ischemic symptoms (rest pain or tissue loss), despite a patent graft. Variables identified on univariate screening (inclusion threshold, P < .20) were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independent predictors.\nLong-term follow-up data were available for 1012 patients who underwent infrainguinal bypasses for CLI, of which 788 (78%) remained patent at 1 year. Of these, 79 (10%) met criteria for the composite end point of clinical failure: 21 (2.7%) for major amputations and 58 (7.4%) for persistent rest pain or tissue loss. In multivariable analysis, significant predictors of clinical failure included dialysis dependence (odds ratio [OR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.84-7.62; P < .001) and preoperative inability to ambulate independently (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.26-3.73; P = .005). A history of coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention was protective (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93; P = .03).\nAfter infrainguinal lower extremity bypass for CLI, 10% of patients with a patent graft did not achieve clinical improvement at 1 year. Preoperative identification of this specific patient subgroup remains challenging. To improve surgical decision making and the overall care of CLI patients, further emphasis needs to be placed on functional outcomes in addition to traditional surgical end points.",

    "abstract": "It is difficult to reliably predict abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion and rupture in individuals. There is increasing interest in the role of patient-specific biomechanical profiling of AAA development and rupture. This review examines evidence to support the use of biomechanical profiling in AAA.\nThe literature was systematically reviewed to examine the evidence to support the role of patient-specific biomechanical profiles in the management of patients with AAA. A search of Medline, Medline in process and other nonindexed citations, and EMBASE was performed for articles published from January 1980 to December 2008. The search strategy retrieved 2410 titles. After exclusions, 83 articles were reviewed in full and form the basis of this review.\nThere is increasing evidence that patient-specific biomechanical factors may be more reliable in predicting AAA rupture than currently available clinical and biochemical parameters. Wall stress determination using finite element analysis is consistently higher in symptomatic and ruptured AAA. Recent improvements in computational methodology and advances in imaging and processing technology have increased the power of these biomechanical factors in predicting AAA expansion and rupture.\nMajor progress has been made in the development of biomechanical profiles for AAA. Large population-based studies for validation of patient-specific biomechanical profiles with rupture risk assessment and tailored decision making are now indicated, particularly with the introduction of AAA screening programs.",

    "abstract": "Several reports suggest unexpectedly high rates of late abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture occur after endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). However, a population-based study examining causes of late death after EVAR vs open surgical repair has not been performed.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing infrarenal AAA repair using information from the Medicare inpatient hospital discharge records (MedPAR files), physician claim files (Part B files, 20% sample), and Medicare Denominator Files for the years 2001 to 2004. Using the Social Security Death Index, we identified all \"late\" deaths, defined as deaths occurring >30 days and after hospital discharge. We used the National Death Index to identify cause of death information; in particular, those deaths that were likely caused by late rupture. We compared causes of late death and survival between EVAR and open repair using Wilcoxon log-rank and rank-sum tests.\nBetween 2001 and 2004, 13,971 patients underwent AAA repair (6119 EVAR, 7852 open repair). After a mean follow-up of 1.6 years in the EVAR cohort and 1.9 years in the open cohort, mortality rates were similar across repair type (15.4% EVAR, 15.9% open repair), with an adjusted odds ratio for death after open repair of 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.07). Of the 2194 documented deaths, 523 occurred before discharge or <or=30 days, and 1671 occurred >30 days and after hospital discharge. Cause of death information for the 1671 late deaths was available from the National Death Index for 1515 (91%). The 15 most common codes for causes of late death were dominated by cardiac disease (atherosclerotic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction) and pulmonary disease (lung cancer, respiratory failure). Causes of late death with specific mention of aneurysm were identified in 37 patients (2.4% of all deaths), but this event was not more common in EVAR or open repair (15 [0.3%] in the EVAR group, 22 [0.3%], in the open repair group; P = .71).\nLate deaths from aneurysm rupture after EVAR or open repair appear to be relatively infrequent and similarly distributed across procedure type. Our results emphasize that the effectiveness of EVAR is comparable to open AAA repair in preventing aneurysm-related death.",

Cardiovascular events were more frequent in the subgroups of patients with genotypes associated with high serum levels of IL-6: -174CC (57.14% vs 12.5% for -174GC genotype and 8% for -174GG, P = .007) and nt565AA (50% vs 17.6% for nt565GA genotype and 8% for nt565GG genotype, P = .021) and in subgroups with haplotypes associated with low serum levels of IL-10: ATA (57.14% vs 14.8% for haplotype ACC and 7.4% for GCC, GCA, GTA, GTC haplotypes, P = .004). Flow-mediated dilatation was significantly lower in patients with IL-6 -174CC genotype (7.05% +/- 1.49% vs 8.41% +/- 1.9% for IL-6 -174GC and 9.42% +/- 2.46% for IL-6 -174GG, P = .009) and IL-6 nt565AA genotype (7.14 +/- 1.61% vs 8.49% +/- 1.91% for IL-6 nt565GA and 9.42% +/- 2.46% for IL-6 nt565GG, P = .018) and in patients with IL-10ATA haplotype (6.45% +/- 0.57% vs 9.13% +/- 2.52% for IL-10ACC and 9.24% +/- 2.09% for IL-10 GCC/GCA/GTA/GTC, P = .004) respectively.\nIL-6 -174CC and nt565AA genotypes and IL-10ATA haplotypes are correlated with a high short-term risk of acute postoperative cardiovascular events in patients with peripheral artery disease receiving elective surgical revascularization and with endothelial dysfunction in these patients.",

    "abstract": "While much attention has been devoted toward treatment paradigms for idiopathic axillo-subclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT), little has focused on long-term durability of aggressive treatment and its associated functional outcomes. The purpose of this study was to review our own surgical therapeutic algorithm and its associated durability and functional outcomes.\nAll patients treated with combined endovascular and open surgery at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center for ASVT from 1988 to 2008 were identified. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and operative techniques were recorded. Patency, freedom from reintervention, and functional outcomes were documented. Follow-up via telephone and clinic visit allowed quantitative comparison of functional status, pre- and postoperatively.\nThirty-six patients were treated for ASVT throughout the study interval. Seven patients (19.4%) were lost to follow-up. Most patients were male (66%; N = 24); mean age was 32 years. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was utilized in the majority of patients (83.3%; N = 30) with an average time from symptom onset to lysis of 12 days. Surgical decompression was undertaken in all patients via transaxillary (52%; N = 19), supraclavicular (31%; N = 11), or infraclavicular approaches (17%; N = 6). Eleven stents were placed in 11 patients (30.5%) for residual stenotic disease. Mean follow-up was 65 months, with 1- and 5-year overall patency at 100% and 94%, respectively. Freedom from reintervention was 100% and 74.4% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Seven patients (19.4%) required postoperative reintervention with four receiving additional lytic therapy, two requiring a stent, and one venoplasty. At presentation, 65.5% (N = 19) of patients were unable to work or perform routine activities. After treatment, 86% (N = 25) returned to their employment and have experienced sustained symptomatic and functional improvement.\nPatients with symptomatic idiopathic axillo-subclavian vein thrombosis can expect durable patency with sustained freedom from reintervention following aggressive combined endovascular and surgical treatment. Good functional outcomes can be expected in patients with relief of symptoms and return to work.",

A right thoracotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass facilitated repair through an extra-anatomic bypass between the ascending and the supradiaphragmatic descending aorta. Results for the immediate and 2-year radiologic and clinical check-up were satisfactory. The most common complications in anatomic correction are stroke under selective cerebral perfusion, risk of paraplegia, and hemorrhage. We present a new technique for repair of interruption of the aortic arch in adults that avoids the need for extended dissection of the aorta and a partial occlusion clamp during anastomosis and allows for cerebral and medullar perfusion.",

    "abstract": "This study describes three techniques of stent placement at the iliocaval confluence for chronic nonmalignant obstruction and its stent-related outcome.\nFrom 1997 to 2008, 115 patients (230 limbs) underwent bilateral stenting for iliocaval obstruction. All limbs were CEAP classified using clinical examination and duplex ultrasound study. Three techniques were compared: placement of two stents side by side in a \"double-barrel\" (group DB, n = 39); inverted Y stenting through a fenestra (window) created through the side braiding of a stent placed previously across the iliocaval confluence (group iY, n = 38); apposition of a stent as close as possible to a stent previously placed across the iliocaval confluence, leaving a small area unsupported between the stents (group A, n = 38). Patency was assessed with venography and duplex ultrasound imaging. Cumulative patency curves were calculated.\nMedian age was 54 years (range, 14-76 years); female/male ratio was 2.8:1. Obstructions were primary in 141 limbs and postthrombotic in 89, and 29 required recanalization of occlusions. The C(4-6) rate and ratio of limbs with postthrombotic obstruction were significantly higher in group iY vs group DB (49% and 32% [P = .049]; 47% and 28% [P = .022], respectively). The median follow-up was 12 months (range, 1-108 months) in 107 patients (93%). The overall primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates at 4 years were 61%, 92%, and 98%, respectively. The distribution of occluded stent systems (n = 4) and frequency of reinterventions (n = 29) were reflected in the primary and secondary patency rates for groups A, DB, and iY at 4 years (77% and 100%, 73% and 100%, and 41% and 90%, respectively). The frequency of reinterventions was significantly lower in group DB vs groups A and iY (8%, 32%, and 37%, respectively; P < .01).\nChronic iliocaval confluence obstruction is best managed by double-barrel stenting when feasible. The apposition technique requires a high reintervention rate owing to restenosis of the unsupported segment. The secondary stent patency appears to be less in limbs with postthrombotic occlusion. Primary stent patency of nonocclusive obstruction was inferior in group iY regardless of etiology of obstruction. However, inverted Y fenestration is the only choice in delayed contralateral stenting or when the inferior vena cava is extensively involved. There is no optimal solution to the treatment of the iliocaval confluence presently, and the choice of technique is decided by the extent, site, and type of obstruction.",

    "abstract": "Advances in endovascular techniques have provided new options in the treatment of complex infrainguinal occlusive lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of endovascular interventions on TransAtlantic InterSociety (TASC) II D femoropopliteal occlusive disease.\nAll patients undergoing endovascular interventions for femoropopliteal occlusive disease between July 2004 and July 2009 were reviewed. Patient demographics, pre- and postprocedure ankle-brachial indices (ABI) and anatomic factors were analyzed. Outcomes evaluated included primary patency, assisted-patency, secondary patency, predictors of restenosis, and wound healing.\nFive hundred eighty-five limbs were treated during the period reviewed. The study group included 79 TASC D limbs in 74 patients (mean age 76.5 +/- 11.9 years, male sex: 53%). Fifty-six limbs (71%) underwent treatment for critical limb ischemia, including 42 (53%) with tissue loss. Eleven patients (15%) had previous failed bypasses. Preoperative ABIs were unobtainable for 23 patients, while the remaining 56 had a mean baseline ABI of 0.54 +/- 0.28. There was one periprocedural mortality. Five patients (6.3%) had periprocedural complications. Mean increase in ABI postprocedure was 0.49 +/- 0.35. Follow-up was available for 74 limbs at a mean of 10.7 months (range, 1-35). There were 18 mortalities (24.3%) during the follow-up period. No patient required a major amputation during this follow-up period. Twenty-one limbs (26.6%) experienced restenosis and nine limbs (11.4%) experienced occlusion. Twenty-nine limbs underwent reintervention during the follow-up time, including nine which underwent multiple reinterventions. Primary, assisted-primary, and secondary patency rates at 12 and 24 months were 52.2%, 88.4%, 92.6% and 27.5%, 74.2%, and 88.9%, respectively. Predictors of restenosis/occlusion included hypercholesterolemia, the presence of a popliteal artery stent, and patients who were current or former smokers.\nEndovascular interventions for TASC II D lesions can be safely performed with excellent hemodynamic improvement and limb salvage rates. Restenosis is not uncommon in this population, which mandates strict follow-up. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term efficacy of these interventions.",

    "abstract": "Dialysis-associated steal syndrome with rest pain and ischemic nonhealing ulcers dictates prompt surgical intervention. Distal revascularization with interval ligation is extensive surgery for frail patients in whom calcified distal arteries make anastomosis difficult. Simple banding is appropriate in high-flow fistulas. In low-flow accesses, further flow reduction by simple banding may result in inadequate dialysis and cause thrombosis. However, banding between puncture sites maintains a pressure gradient between the arterial and venous puncture sites that enables adequate flow with effective hemodialysis that would not be possible with banding at the anastomosis. This new technique is a good solution for maintaining access patency and increasing digital pressure while avoiding complicated surgical revisions in high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "We assessed whether individualized shortened duration of elastic compression stocking (ECS) therapy after acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is feasible without increasing the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS).\nAt the outpatient clinic of the Maastricht University Medical Centre, 125 consecutive patients with confirmed proximal DVT were followed for 2 years. Villalta scores were assessed on four consecutive visits; 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the acute event. Reflux was assessed once by duplex testing. After 6 months, patients with scores <or=4 on the Villalta clinical score and in the absence of reflux were allowed to discontinue ECS therapy. If reflux was present, two consecutive scores <or=4 were needed to discontinue ECS therapy.\nECS therapy was discontinued in 17% of patients at 6 months, in 48% at 12 months, and in 50% at 24 months. Reflux on duplex testing was present in 74/101 (73.3%) tested patients and was not associated with the onset of PTS. At the 6-month visit, the cumulative incidence of PTS was 13.3%, at 12 months 17.0%, and at 24 months 21.1%. Varicosities/venous insufficiency (present at baseline) was significantly associated with PTS; hazard ratio 3.2 (1.2-9.1).\nPatients with a low probability for developing PTS can be identified as early as 6 months after the thrombotic event, and individualized shortened duration of ECS therapy based on Villalta clinical scores may be a safe management option. These findings need to be confirmed in a randomized clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease when an approach to the abdominal aorta is undesirable. The major limitation of this technique has resulted from the morbidity rate associated with thoracotomy in a relatively high-risk vascular surgery population. As a minimally invasive procedure, videoendoscopy has been shown to improve the patient postoperative course and comfort in the field of general and thoracic surgery. The same benefits could be expected from a videoendoscopic surgery involving the thoracic aorta. In 2003 we reported the first case of a totally videoendoscopic descending thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery bypass procedure. In this article we report our additional experience with and the modifications we have made to this technique.",

    "abstract": "The use of an aortic patch containing the visceral and renal arteries is a well-established technique during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. However, the retained aortic tissue may later become aneurysmal. We reviewed our TAAA repair experience using a presewn aortic branched graft to eliminate this risk.\nBetween March 2003 and December 2008, 52 patients with Crawford extent II and III TAAAs had surgical repair using a presewn aortic branched graft. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans with intravenous contrast were available for 41 patients (mean angiographic follow-up 2.3 years). The mean age of these 41 patients was 59 +/- 16 years (range, 22-86), and 21 patients were female (51%). The indications for surgery were degenerative aneurysms in 30 patients (73%), type B dissections in 10 patients (24%), and visceral patch aneurysm in 1 patient (2.4%). Twenty-four patients (59%) underwent repair of a Crawford extent II TAAA and 17 patients (41%) had extent III TAAA repair.\nPatency of the branches to the visceral and renal arteries at 1 and 5 years was 100% and 98%, respectively. Of the 148 graft branches, 2 became occluded and 4 developed stenosis (2 patients). One patient required percutaneous stenting of 3 stenosed branches, and 1 patient died after acute occlusion of 2 branches and stenosis of a third. During the follow-up period that extended to 6.3 years, there were 10 late deaths. Six patients required reoperation on the aortic graft or contiguous aorta, but no reoperations have been required on the visceral abdominal aorta or its branches.\nThe use of a presewn aortic branched graft is a safe and suitable option for TAAA repair. With midterm follow-up, this technique seems to eliminate the risk of visceral patch aneurysms and results in favorable durability and patency.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, endovascular repair of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) has become a valid alternative to open repair. This study analyzes the incidence and origin of stent graft fractures after endovascular repair, its impact on patency, and strategies to prevent fractures.\nData of 78 atherosclerotic PAAs in 64 patients were gathered in a prospectively-held database from 1998 to 2009. All x-rays were reviewed to detect stent fractures. Only circumferential fractures were included for analysis; localized strut fractures were excluded. Clinical endpoints were circumferential stent fracture, occlusion, and clinical status of the patient.\nMean follow-up time was 50 months (range, 1-127 months). Fifteen circumferential stent fractures occurred in 13 (16.7%) patients. The majority of stent fractures (93.3%) were associated with the use of multiple stent grafts. At univariate analysis, younger age was identified as the only significant predictor for stent fracture (P = .007). The cumulative stent fracture-free survival was estimated at 78% and 73% at 5- and 10-year follow-up, respectively. The cumulative primary patency rate, defined as time to occlusion, was not different for the fracture group compared with the nonfracture group (P = .284).\nThe incidence of stent fractures after endovascular PAA repair is probably underreported in the literature. Stent graft fractures mainly occur at overlap zones and are associated with younger age of the patient. Fracture of the stent did not significantly influence patency of the stent graft.",

    "abstract": "This study hypothesized that preoperative statin therapy would have a protective effect on patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and that the risk-reduction effect of these agents would result in a reduction in subsequent total hospital costs.\nAll patients who underwent an elective endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) or open AAA repair (OAR) between 2004 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical end points included postoperative days, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, hemorrhage, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound infection), and 30-day mortality. The financial end point was total hospital cost associated with the procedure.\nWe identified 401 patients, consisting of 173 EVAR patients (43%) and 228 OAR (57%). Despite a higher Society for Vascular Surgery risk score, the EVAR statin cohort had significantly reduced postoperative days (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs 2.3 +/- 0.3, P < .05) and hospital length of stay (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 2.8 +/- 0.4, P < .05) compared with the nonstatin EVAR cohort. Postoperative complications (4.4% vs 14.7%, P < .05) and the mortality rate (0.0% vs 5.9%, P < .05) were significantly decreased in the OAR statin cohort compared with the nonstatin OAR cohort and trended to be decreased in the EVAR statin group. Statin therapy translated into a lower total cost per patient of $3,205 for EVAR and $3,792 for OAR (P < .05).\nWith respect to both clinical outcome measures and subsequent resource utilization, statin therapy is associated with a beneficial effect in patients undergoing elective AAA repair. These data suggest that preoperative statin therapy should be an integral part of the risk optimization for patients undergoing AAA repair.",

Patients were assessed on resting energy expenditure, body composition, ankle brachial index (ABI), and calf blood flow.\nPatients with critical limb ischemia had a lower resting energy expenditure than patients with intermittent claudication (1429 +/- 190 kcal/day vs 1563 +/- 229 kcal/day; P = .004), and higher body fat percentage (34.8 +/- 7.8% vs 31.5 +/- 7.8%; P = .037), higher fat mass (30.0 +/- 9.3 kg vs 26.2 +/- 8.9 kg;P = .016), and lower ABI (0.31 +/- 0.11 vs 0.79 +/- 0.23; P < .001). Resting energy expenditure was predicted by fat free mass (P < .0001), age (P < .0001), ABI (P < .0001), ethnicity (P < .0001), calf blood flow (P = .005), and diabetes (P = .008).

Furthermore, patients with critical limb ischemia who are most susceptible for decline in resting energy expenditure are older, African American patients with diabetes.

We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine perioperative mortality and postoperative renal dysfunction after open repair for non-ruptured JAA.\nThe Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all studies reporting non-ruptured JAA repair published between January 1966 and December 2008. Two independent observers selected studies for inclusion, assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies, and performed the data extraction. Study heterogeneity was assessed using forest plots and by calculating the between-study variance. Outcomes were perioperative mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction, and new onset of dialysis. Summary estimates with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated using a random effects model based on the binomial distribution.\nTwenty-one non-randomized cohort studies from 1986 to 2008, reporting on 1256 patients, were included. Heterogeneity between the studies was low. The mean perioperative mortality was 2.9% (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.6). The mean incidence of new onset of dialysis was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.5). Incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction could be derived from 13 studies and ranged from 0% to 39% (median, 18%). In seven studies, cold renal perfusion during suprarenal clamping was performed in order to preserve renal function; however, based upon the included data, definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy could not be drawn.\nOpen repair of non-ruptured JAA using suprarenal cross-clamping can be performed with acceptable perioperative mortality; however, postoperative deterioration of renal function is a common complication. Preservation of renal function after JAA repair requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "To determine diversity in the membership and analyze representation of private practitioners and ethnic and racial minorities/women in senior leadership roles in a regional vascular society.\nThe program book distributed at the 2008 annual meeting was used to compile information on membership categories, academic status, gender, and ethnic origin of members. Excluded from further analysis were all but active and senior members (n = 386). Officers for President and current President-Elect (P, n = 31), Secretary (S, n = 10), Treasurer (T, n = 11), and Councilor (C, n = 33) over a 30-year period were scrutinized for similar information. Members were considered to be \"academic\" if they worked full time at an academic medical center or as faculty at a teaching hospital with a vascular fellowship and national recognition. Private practice (PP) or academic practice (AP) was determined by personal knowledge, mailing address, e-mail address, and search engines. Ethnic and racial origin was determined by name, personal knowledge, or a web search.\nOf the 386 active and senior members in the society, 86% were white, 13.7% were of various ethnic/racial groups, and 5.7% were women. Sixty-eight percent of members were in PP. Female members were more likely to be in AP compared with male members (68.1% vs 29.6%, P <.0002). White males made up 89.4% of all officers and 94.2% of all senior positions over the 30 years of the society. Seventy officer positions were occupied by those in AP (82.3%) vs 15 positions (18%) for the PP group. For the senior positions, 92.3% were from the AP group compared with the 8% from the PP group. (P < .0036) White male academics (WMAs) (23.7% of membership) occupied 86% of all senior leadership and 57% of C positions compared with 13% and 42%, respectively, for the rest of the membership (P < .0041). Of the 33 C positions, 66.6% were filled by members in AP. Of these 22 AP Councilors, 11 (50%) then moved up to senior leadership positions compared with two of 11 (18%) PP councilors (P = .07).\nEthnic and racial minorities and women are under represented in the membership compared with the general population, medical school graduates, and faculty. PPs and non-white male academics are under represented in senior leadership positions. With changing demographics, a predicted shortage of vascular surgeons, the need for role models in leadership positions and a push to culturally competent care, regional and national societies must change course and promote a more diverse membership and representative senior leadership.",

    "abstract": "Prior research has established diversity as a topic of empirical analysis in the vascular surgery literature. Building on the work of previously published articles on diversity in the Journal of Vascular Surgery and elsewhere, this article engages in a broad discussion of diversity in two interrelated arenas: educational/workplace diversity and culturally competent care. Interdisciplinary review of the literature indicates that diversity is often thought of as an end-state to be accomplished. A more fruitful way to encompass the changing aspects of diversity work is to think of diversity as a set of processes that can be adjusted based on a set of interrelated goals that matter differently to different groups. In considering diversity as a process, an approach to diversity emerges that considers both independent effects of gender and race/ethnicity as well as interactive effects between the two variables to address future trends in medical education. Such trends are diagnosed and multiple courses of intervention are offered as reasonable options for future efforts. A comprehensive definition of diversity will be established in order to encompass two different arenas in which diversity concerns arise: educational diversity and culturally competent patient care. Second, a discussion of the rationales for attention to diversity among vascular surgeons will provide different avenues into a conversation about diversity in the profession. In so doing, three successful efforts will be briefly discussed: the Ohio State University's MED-Path program, the Keck School of Medicine's chair-centered approach to diversity in residency training, and the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons' (AAOS) approach to culturally competent care.",

    "abstract": "Vascular disease is the most prevalent condition in patients aged >60 years, leading to increasing complications associated with their comorbid conditions. Poor medical compliance could be one reason why the rate of complications may be higher in this patient population, particularly the uninsured. This study was conducted to better assess rates of medication compliance in vascular surgical patients.\nConsecutive patients seen in vascular clinics at a busy tertiary academic center were prospectively studied. Physicians and physician assistants used a standardized questionnaire to collect patient data and evaluated patients for coexisting medical conditions and medication use. Optimal medical therapy was defined according to the 2006 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) \"Guidelines for Secondary Prevention for Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease.\" Data were analyzed using multivariate regression.\nDuring the 4-month study period, 180 consecutive patients (47% men) were seen in vascular surgery clinics. Most patients (79%) were nonsmokers and only 21% admitted to smoking. Comorbid conditions surveyed included hypertension in 141, diabetes mellitus in 56, coronary artery disease in 24, hypercholesterolemia in 89, and chronic renal failure in 13; of these, 61% were insured and 39% had no insurance. Overall, only 31% of all patients were receiving adequate medical therapy for their comorbid conditions, and about 66% were receiving suboptimal medical treatment for their vascular disease. Uninsured patients were less likely (19%) than insured patients (39%) to receive optimal medical therapy (P = .012). Lack of insurance was a predictor of suboptimal medical therapy for hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-8.16; P = .016), hypercholesterolemia (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.87-13.88; P = .001), peripheral arterial disease (OR, 13.32; 95% CI, 2.84-62.54, P < .001), and any disease overall (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.21-4.88, P = .012). Overall, men and women were equally likely (68%) to receive suboptimal medical therapy; however, women were significantly more likely to be undertreated for coronary artery disease (OR, 0.022; 95% CI, 0.0017-0.293; P < .001).\nCompliance with optimal medical therapy for secondary risk factor management amongst our vascular surgery patients is low. Uninsured patients are less likely to receive optimal medical therapy than their insured counterparts. This survey provides sobering statistics regarding medical compliance in our population. This issue deserves further study and may indirectly affect outcomes in minority groups that are disproportionately represented in our uninsured patients.",

It may be easy to document disparities, but it is harder to understand their underlying causes. Are there biologic differences between members of racial and ethnic groups that influence disease presentation and outcomes?

    "abstract": "Thoracic endoluminal aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) is associated with improved outcomes compared with open thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. This study was designed to better characterize TEVAR outcomes in a large population, and to determine if outcomes are independently influenced by patient ethnicity and insurance status.\nUsing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we selected patients who underwent TEVAR between 2001 and 2005. Ethnicity and insurance type were independently evaluated against the outcome variables of mortality and postoperative complications. Age, gender, hospital region, hospital location, hospital size, and comorbidities were controlled as cofounders.\nBetween 2001 and 2005, 875 patients underwent TEVAR. There was a significantly greater proportion of Caucasians (n = 650) compared with African Americans (n = 104) or Hispanics (n = 49). Patients had a male preponderance, and most procedures were elective. The overall mortality was 13.3% (n = 117), and spinal cord ischemia was 0.8% (n = 7), with no differences between patients of varied ethnicity or payer status. Significant differences were noted among the races including gender (P = .003), income (P < .0001), hospital region (P < .001), hospital bed size (P = .013), and insurance type (P < .001).

Even though the independent, self-employed, private practice, medical staff remains the most common model, surgical specialists such as vascular surgeons are increasingly being employed and integrated into health care delivery systems. The degree of integration varies from minimal to full integration or full employment. This review defines the forces driving these changes and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of each employment model from the physicians' point of view. Strategies for the successful implementation of a 21st century integrative employment model are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated virtual reality (VR) simulation for endovascular training of medical students to determine whether innate perceptual, visuospatial, and psychomotor aptitude (VSA) can predict initial and plateau phase of technical endovascular skills acquisition.\nTwenty medical students received didactic and endovascular training on a commercially available VR simulator. Each student treated a series of 10 identical noncomplex renal artery stenoses endovascularly. The simulator recorded performance data instantly and objectively. An experienced interventionalist rated the performance at the initial and final sessions using generic (out of 40) and procedure-specific (out of 30) rating scales. VSA were tested with fine motor dexterity (FMD, Perdue Pegboard), psychomotor ability (minimally invasive virtual reality surgical trainer [MIST-VR]), image recall (Rey-Osterrieth), and organizational aptitude (map-planning). VSA performance scores were correlated with the assessment parameters of endovascular skills at commencement and completion of training.\nMedical students exhibited statistically significant learning curves from the initial to the plateau performance for contrast usage (medians, 28 vs 17 mL, P < .001), total procedure time (2120 vs 867 seconds, P < .001), and fluoroscopy time (993 vs. 507 seconds, P < .001). Scores on generic and procedure-specific rating scales improved significantly (10 vs 25, P < .001; 8 vs 17 P < .001). Significant correlations were noted for FMD with initial and plateau sessions for fluoroscopy time (r(s) = -0.564, P = .010; r(s) = -.449, P = .047). FMD correlated with procedure-specific scores at the initial session (r(s) = .607, P = .006). Image recall correlated with generic skills at the end of training (r(s) = .587, P = .006).\nSimulator-based training in endovascular skills improved performance in medical students. There were significant correlations between initial endovascular skill and fine motor dexterity as well as with image recall at end of the training period. In addition to current recruitment strategies, VSA may be a useful tool for predictive validity studies.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (rDTAA) is associated with high mortality rates. Data supporting endovascular thoracic aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) to reduce mortality compared with open repair are limited to small series. We investigated published reports for contemporary outcomes of open and endovascular repair of rDTAA.\nWe systematically reviewed all studies describing the outcomes of rDTAA treated with open repair or TEVAR since 1995 using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) databases. Case reports or studies published before 1995 were excluded. All articles were critically appraised for relevance, validity, and availability of data regarding treatment outcomes. All data were systematically pooled, and meta-analyses were performed to investigate 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and paraplegia rates after both types of repair.\nOriginal data of 224 patients (70% male) with rDTAA were identified: 143 (64%) were treated with TEVAR and 81 (36%) with open repair. Mean age was 70 +/- 5.6 years. The 30-day mortality was 19% for patients treated with TEVAR for rDTAA compared 33% for patients treated with open repair, which was significant (odds ratio [OR], 2.15, P = .016). The 30-day occurrence rates of myocardial infarction (11.1% vs 3.5%; OR, 3.70, P < .05), stroke (10.2% vs 4.1%; OR, 2.67; P = .117), and paraplegia (5.5% vs 3.1%; OR, 1.83; P = .405) were increased after open repair vs TEVAR, but this failed to reach statistical significance for stroke and paraplegia. Five additional patients in the TEVAR group died of aneurysm-related causes after 30 days, during a median follow-up of 17 +/- 10 months. Follow-up data after open repair were insufficient. The estimated aneurysm-related survival at 3 years after TEVAR was 70.6%.\nEndovascular repair of rDTAA is associated with a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate compared with open surgical repair. TEVAR was associated with a considerable number of aneurysm-related deaths during follow-up.",

    "abstract": "A greater incidence of varicose veins has been reported in premenopausal women than in men. We hypothesized that the sex differences in venous function reflect reduced constriction and enhanced venous dilation in women due to direct venous relaxation effects of estrogen on specific estrogen receptors (ER).\nCircular segments of inferior vena cava (IVC) from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were suspended between two wires, and isometric contraction (in mg/mg tissue) to phenylephrine, angiotensin II (AngII), and 96 mM KCl was measured. To investigate sex differences in venous smooth muscle, Ca(2+) release from the intracellular stores, and Ca(2+) entry from the extracellular space, the transient phenylephrine contraction in 0 Ca(2+) Krebs was measured. Extracellular CaCl(2) (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2.5 mM) was added, and the [Ca(2+)](e)-dependent contraction was measured. To investigate sex differences in venous endothelial function, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was measured. To test the role of specific ERs, the amount of venous tissue ERs was measured using Western blots, and the venous relaxation in response to 17beta-estradiol (E2, activator of most ERs), 4,4,'4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)-tris-phenol (PPT; ERalpha agonist), 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN; ERbeta agonist), and ICI 182,780 (ERalpha/ERbeta antagonist, and G protein-coupled receptor 30 [GPR30] agonist) was measured in IVC segments nontreated or treated with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME).\nPhenylephrine caused concentration-dependent contraction that was less in female (max 104.2 +/- 16.2) than male IVC (172.4 +/- 20.4). AngII (10(-6))-induced contraction was also less in female (81.0 +/- 11.1) than male IVC (122.5 +/- 15.0). Phenylephrine contraction in 0 Ca(2+) Krebs was insignificantly less in female (4.8 +/- 1.8) than male IVC (7.2 +/- 1.7), suggesting little difference in the intracellular Ca(2+) release mechanism. In contrast, the [Ca(2+)](e)-dependent contraction was significantly reduced in female than male IVC. Also, contraction to membrane depolarization by 96 mM KCl, which stimulates Ca(2+) influx, was less in female (129.7 +/- 16.7) than male IVC (319.7 +/- 30.4), supporting sex differences in Ca(2+) entry. Acetylcholine relaxation was greater in female (max 80.6% +/- 4.1%) than male IVC (max 48.0% +/- 6.1%), suggesting sex differences in the endothelium-dependent relaxation pathway. Western blots revealed greater amounts of ERalpha, ERbeta, and GPR30 in female than male IVC. ER agonists caused concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine contraction in female IVC. E2-induced relaxation (max 76.5% +/- 3.4%) was more than DPN (74.8% +/- 9.1%), PPT (71.4% +/- 12.5%), and ICI 182,780 (67.4% +/- 7.8%), and was similar in L-NAME-treated and nontreated IVC.\nThe reduced alpha-adrenergic, AngII, depolarization-induced, and [Ca(2+)](e)-dependent venous contraction in female rats is consistent with sex differences in the Ca(2+) entry mechanisms, possibly due to enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation and increased ER expression/activity in female rats. E2/ER-mediated venous relaxation in female rats is not prevented by NOS blockade, suggesting activation of an NO-independent relaxation pathway. The decreased venous contraction and enhanced E2/ER-mediated venous relaxation would lead to more distensible veins in female rats.",

    "abstract": "Varicose veins (VarVs) are a common disorder of venous dilation and tortuosity with unclear mechanism. The functional integrity and the ability of various regions of the VarVs to constrict is unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that the different degrees of venodilation in different VarV regions reflect segmental differences in the responsiveness to receptor-dependent vasoconstrictive stimuli and/or in the postreceptor signaling mechanisms of vasoconstriction.\nVarix segments and adjacent proximal and distal segments were obtained from patients undergoing VarV stripping. Control great saphenous vein specimens were obtained from patients undergoing lower extremity arterial bypass and coronary artery bypass grafting. Circular vein segments were equilibrated under 2 g of tension in a tissue bath, and changes in isometric constriction in response to angiotensin II (AngII, 10(-11)-10(-7) M), phenylephrine (PHE, 10(-9)-10(-4) M), and KCl (96 mM) were recorded. The amount of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) was measured in vein tissue homogenate.\nAngII caused concentration-dependent constriction in control vein (max 35.3 +/- 9.6 mg/mg tissue, pED(50) 8.48 +/- 0.34). AngII caused less contraction and was less potent in proximal (max 7.9 +/- 2.5, pED(50) 6.85 +/- 0.61), distal (max 5.7 +/- 1.2, pED(50) 6.74 +/- 0.68), and varix segments of VarV (max 7.2 +/- 2.0, pED(50) 7.11 +/- 0.50), suggesting reduced AT(1)R-mediated contractile mechanisms. VarVs and control veins had similar amounts of AT(1)R. alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation with PHE caused concentration-dependent constriction in control veins (max 73.0 +/- 13.9 mg/mg tissue, pED(50) 5.48 +/- 0.12) exceeding that of AngII. PHE produced similar constriction and was equally potent in varix and distal segments but produced less constriction and was less potent in proximal segments of VarVs (max 32.1 +/- 6.4 mg/mg tissue, pED(50) 4.89 +/- 0.13) vs control veins. Membrane depolarization by 96 mM KCl, a receptor-independent Ca(2+)-dependent response, produced significant constriction in control veins and similar contractile response in proximal, distal, and varix VarV segments, indicating tissue viability and intact Ca(2+)-dependent contraction mechanisms.\nCompared with control veins, different regions of VarV display reduced AngII-mediated venoconstriction, which may be involved in the progressive dilation in VarVs. Postreceptor Ca(2+)-dependent contraction mechanisms remain functional in VarVs. The maintained alpha-adrenergic responses in distal and varix segments, and the reduced constriction in the upstream proximal segments, may represent a compensatory adaptation of human venous smooth muscle to facilitate venous return from the dilated varix segments of VarV.",

Membrane depolarization by 96 mM KCl, a receptor-independent Ca(2+)-dependent response, produced significant constriction in control veins and similar contractile response in proximal, distal, and varix VarV segments, indicating tissue viability and intact Ca(2+)-dependent contraction mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 has been linked to a variety of pathologic states involved with matrix remodeling, but its role in aortic pathology has not been previously described. The current study hypothesized that STAT1 regulates aneurysmal degeneration and its role was evaluated in human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and in a mouse model of aortic dissection.\nApolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoE-/-) or ApoE/STAT1 double knockout mice (ApoE/STAT1-/-) were infused with 1000 ng/kg/min of angiotensin II. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in the rodent tail. At sacrifice, aortic diameters and extent of aneurysm formation were measured by digital microscopy. STAT1 and phosphorylated-STAT1 protein levels were assessed in ApoE-/- mice at 0, 7, 14, and 28 days (n = 8/time point) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histology was performed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Movat stains. Statistical analyses included chi(2) test, t test, and analysis of variance.\nSTAT1 messenger RNA and total protein were greater in human AAA vs non-AAA controls. In addition, aneurysms occurred in 8%, 50%, and 80% of ApoE-/- mice at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. Total STAT1 levels were not altered during the course of angiotensin II infusion. Phosphorylated STAT1 levels peaked at 7 days with a 1.4-fold increase over baseline (P < .05). Aneurysms occurred in 0%, 100%, and 100% of ApoE/STAT1-/- mice at 3, 5, and 28 days. In mice infused with angiotensin II for >3 days, aortic rupture occurred more frequently in ApoE/STAT-/- mice (53% vs 19%, P < .05) and at earlier time points (4.0 +/- 0.5 vs 9.2 +/- 0.77 days, P < .05) vs ApoE-/- mice. SBP did not differ between the groups during angiotensin II infusion. By 28 days, aneurysms were larger in ApoE/STAT1-/- mice compared with ApoE-/- mice (2.7 +/- 0.4 vs 1.9 +/- 0.1 mm, P < .05) and were more extensive. H&E and Movat stain did not reveal differences in aortic wall structural content at baseline between ApoE-/- and ApoE/STAT1-/- mice. Both groups demonstrated equal disorganization in the aneurysmal state.\nPhosphorylated STAT1 is elevated during aneurysmal degeneration. Its loss is associated with a higher rate of acute aortic rupture and more extensive aneurysms in a mouse model of aortic dissection. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether these observations are secondary to an underlying aortic wall abnormality or alterations in vessel wall matrix remodeling.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to document the incidence of vascular complications during anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) in 212 consecutive patients treated at the Scripps Clinic and determine what factors adversely affected outcome.\nWe reviewed the prospectively maintained database of all ALIF procedures performed at Scripps Clinic between August 2004 and June 2009. All procedures were performed by a spine surgeon in conjunction with a vascular surgeon who performed the exposure portion of the operation, and protected the vessels from injury during the instrumentation phase of the operation.\nTwo hundred twelve ALIF operations were identified. The mean age of the patients was 53.8 years, and 120 (56.6%) were female. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.6 (range, 18.1 to 47.8). Twenty-two (10.4%) operations were performed at the L4-5 disc space, 149 (70.3%) at L5-S1, and 41 (19.3%) involved L4-L5 with L5-S1. The mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 143 milliliters. There was a significant direct correlation between increasing BMI and EBL (P = .018). Thirteen (6.1%) vascular injuries occurred of which five were major (38.5%). One major arterial injury (0.5%) occurred and required arterial thrombectomy and stent placement. Four of the major vascular injuries were venous in nature and required a multi-suture repair. The remaining eight injuries (61.5%) were venous, the majority of which required a suture repair. There were no mortalities. There was an increase risk of vascular injury when both L4-L5 and L5-S1 were exposed (P = .003) and with the male gender (P = .013). Calcification of the aorto-iliac system did not exert an effect on EBL or vascular injury. In four cases, the surgeon was unable to expose the appropriate disc levels.\nAnterior exposure of the spine for ALIF can be performed safely with a team approach that includes a vascular surgeon. Preoperative evaluation by a vascular surgeon is advisable. Patients with increased BMI and bi-level exposures should be approached with caution.",

Of all the patients, 54 malformations were located in the facial region, eight in the submental region, 10 in the submandible region, and three in the cervical region; all were treated by ultrasound-guided intralesional injections of bleomycin A5. The size of the lesions ranged from 6 x 9 mm to 32 x 39 mm. Injection of bleomycin A5 on venous malformation was then carried out through the inspection of ultrasonography. Repeated course of bleomycin A5 injection was administrated for larger malformations. The amount was 8 mg each time. The therapeutic interval was two to four weeks. The therapeutic outcome on venous malformation was evaluated by physical examination and ultrasonography with Doppler according to the Shou standards, including four grades; cured, basically cured, improved, and invalid. The complications were also observed during and after injection.\nThe duration of follow-up ranged from 6 to 24 months. The average times of treatment were 1.64 times. Among them, 42 patients (56%) received only one time of treatment, 21 (28%) patients received two times, nine (12%) patients received three times, and three (4%) patients received four times. According to criteria of therapeutic outcome, the results showed cured in 63 patients (84%), basically cured in 10 patients (13.33%), improved in two patients (2.67%), and none ineffective. Seventy-one patients (94.67%) had local swelling in injection region for several days and two patients (2.67%) developed temporary dizziness after treatment. There were no other complications recorded.\nIntralesional injection of bleomycin A5 establishes a promisingly effect way for patients suffering from VM in the cervical-facial region under ultrasound guidance.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, K-DOQI guidelines have increasingly emphasized the importance of autogenous arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) for dialysis access. A complication of AVF is aneurysmal dilatation with a subset developing massive diffuse aneurysm. Treatment of massive aneurysmal AVF generally involves either ligation or resection with use of prosthetic interposition. To maintain an all-autogenous access, we developed a procedure to treat massive aneurysmal AVF in which the luminal diameter is reduced, excess length is resected, and the new reconstructed AVF is re-tunneled for continued use. The purpose of this study is to examine the midterm outcomes of this novel procedure.\nOver a 4-year period, the reduction/revision procedure was performed on 19 patients with an AVF diameter of 4-7 cm. Indications for operation were thrombosis, skin breakdown, infection, bleeding, and/or poor flow. Revision was performed by resecting redundant length, reducing diameter, and then reconstructing the fistula.\nThe median patient age was 47, interquartile range (IQR) 29. There were 13 men and 6 women. The median follow-up was 23 months, IQR 22. The median primary patency was 14 months, IQR 24. The median secondary patency was 16.5 months, IQR 26. Two patients died, one AVF thrombosed, and two were ligated secondary to infection. Three fistulae developed a stenosis that was treated with percutaneous angioplasty. There are no recurrent aneurysms to date.\nSurgical resection of excess length, reduction of luminal diameter, and reconstruction is a viable option for the treatment of complicated massive diffusely aneurysmal AVF. This technique offers the ability to maintain the benefits of an all autogenous dialysis access while conserving future dialysis sites.",

    "abstract": "To prospectively determine the distribution, extent, and age of venous thrombosis in patients presenting with acute signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism and identify candidates for thrombolysis.\nFive hundred seventy-six consecutive patients (281 male, 295 female; mean age 58) referred for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) assessment between November 2007 and April 2008 were included in the study. Documented cases of DVT were categorized by age (acute, chronic, and acute on chronic), anatomic location, and extent. Patients with iliofemoral and femoropopliteal DVT were evaluated for thrombolysis using standard criteria.\nDVT was found in 19% of patients (112/576). Of these, 31 patients (27.7%, 31/112) had isolated calf DVT, 61 patients (54.5%, 61/112) had proximal vein thrombosis extending into the femoropopliteal venous segments, and 20 patients (17.9%, 20/112) presented with iliofemoral DVT. Using standard criteria, 12 patients were selected as potential candidates for pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PhMT). This equated to an incidence of 2% (12/576) in the population studied, 11% of patients (12/112) with DVT, 26.1% of patients (12/46) presenting with acute proximal DVT, and 20% of patients (4/20) with iliofemoral DVT.\nThe incidence of potential candidates for thrombolysis is low.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated long-term characteristics of chronic venous disease (CVD) progression and its correlation with the modification of specific risk factors.\nThe contralateral limb of 73 patients (95% women; mean age, 48 +/- 12 years) undergoing varicose vein surgery was prospectively evaluated using physical and color duplex examination and classified by CEAP. After 5 years of follow-up, development of new sites of reflux among the contralateral, preoperatively asymptomatic limbs and modification of predisposing factors, including prolonged orthostatism, obesity, estrogen therapy (ET), multiparity, and elastic stockings use (ESU), were assessed. Data were analyzed with Pearson chi(2), t test, binary logistic regression, and Spearman rho.\nForty-eight new sites of reflux (superficial system, 37; perforators, 5; deep veins, 6) were revealed in 38 limbs (52%). CEAP scores significantly deteriorated: clinical, 2.2 +/- 0.5 from 0.1 +/- 0.03 (P < .01); anatomic, 3.8 +/- 1.2 from 2.6 +/- 2.5 (P < .05); disability, 1.9 +/- 0.7 from 0 (P < .01); and severity, 7.9 +/- 2.4 from 2.7 +/- 2.2 (P < .01). Patient compliance to predisposing factor modification was low; no change was observed during follow-up (orthostatism, P = .9; obesity, P = 0.7; ET, P = .9; multiparity, P = .4; ESU, P = .3). CVD progression was significantly lower in patients who controlled orthostatism vs those who maintained orthostatism or initiated it (P < .001) and in patients who controlled preoperative obesity vs those who became obese or maintained obesity (P < .001). Non-ESU patients had a significantly higher incidence of CVD progression vs those who started ESU or continued during the study (P < .001). By binary logistic regression analysis, orthostatism (P = .002; B coefficient value [BCV] = 1.745), obesity (P = .009; BCV = 1.602), and ESU (P = .037; BCV = 0.947) were independent predictive factors for CVD progression, whereas multiparity (P = .174) and ET (P = .429) were not.\nIn about half of patients with unilateral varicosities, CVD developed in the contralateral initially asymptomatic limb in 5 years. CVD progression consisted of reflux development and clinical deterioration of the affected limbs. Obesity, orthostatism, and noncompliance with ESU were independent risk factors for CVD progression, but ET and multiparity were not. Maintenance of a normal body weight, limitation of prolonged orthostatism, and systematic ESU may be recommended in patients with CVD to limit future disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography venography (CTV) with three-dimensional reconstruction can provide complementary road maps for varicose vein (VV) surgery. The purpose of this study is to verify the role of CTV in the treatment of VV in terms of advantages and complications.\nNinety-four consecutive patients with VV underwent conventional high ligation, stripping, and varicosectomy by a single vascular surgeon in 2007. All patients were evaluated with duplex ultrasound and CTV. Patients with renal dysfunction, allergy to radiocontrast, telangiectasia only, or treated by endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) were excluded from the study. Computed tomography (CT) examination was performed with a 16-Multidetector CT scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and 3D images were reconstructed by personal computer-based software (Rapidia, Infinitt, Seoul, Korea). Medical records and the CT images were reviewed retrospectively.\nVV surgeries were done in 127 limbs of 94 patients (both in 33, right in 29, and left in 32). There were 56 females and 38 males with the mean age of 57 years (range, 28-79 years). The CEAP classification was C(2-3) EpAsPr. Perforators larger than 1 mm near the varicose veins were detected and marked on the CT volume-rendering images. The average numbers of perforators marked by CTV were 12.07 +/- 4.27 in each limb. The perforators were evaluated by duplex for the presence of reflux (>or=0.5 sec). Mean number of perforators with reflux in each limb was 1.41 +/- 1.67, which were ligated during the surgery. Incidental detections of other disease were done in six patients, including uterine myomas, an ovarian cyst, a gallstone, a scrotoal varicocele, and a pes anserine bursitis. Operation was performed with the CTV images on screen. CTV was helpful in designing the operation in most patients. Three-D CTV images of saphenopopliteal junction especially provided thorough understanding of the complex variable anatomy of the lesion. There were no CT-related complications, such as renal dysfunction or allergic reaction.\nCT venography can provide excellent road map for VV surgery without significant complications. It cannot replace duplex ultrasound, but can provide powerful 3D images for designing operation as well as education and research.",

    "abstract": "Global positioning system (GPS) recordings can provide valid information on walking capacity in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication (IC) during community-based outdoor walking. This study used GPS to determine the variability of the free-living walking distance between two stops (WDBS), induced by lower-limb pain, which may exist within a single stroll in PAD patients with IC and the potential associated parameters obtained from GPS analysis.\nThis cross-sectional study of 57 PAD patients with IC was conducted in a university hospital. The intervention was a 1-hour free-living walking in a flat public park with GPS recording at 0.5 Hz. GPS-computed parameters for each patient were WDBS, previous stop duration (PSD), cumulated time from the beginning of the stroll, and average walking speed for each walking bout. The coefficient of variation of each parameter was calculated for patients with the number of walking bouts (N(WB)) >or=5 during their stroll. A multivariate analysis was performed to correlate WDBS with the other parameters.\nMean (SD) maximal individual WDBS was 1905 (1189) vs 550 (621) meters for patients with N(WB) <5 vs N(WB) >or= 5, respectively (P < .001). In the 36 patients with N(WB) >or= 5, the coefficient of variation for individual WDBS was 43%. Only PSD and cumulated time were statistically associated with WDBS in 16 and 5 patients, respectively.\nA wide short-term variability of WDBS exists and likely contributes to the difficulties experienced by patients with IC to estimate their maximal walking distance at leisurely pace. Incomplete recovery from a preceding walk, as estimated through PSD, seems to dominantly account for the WDBS in patients with IC.",

    "abstract": "The availability of autologous vein grafts remains the limiting factor in infragenual bypass surgery in many patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Alternatives such as prosthetic conduits are known to have a poor outcome and most are not resistant to infection. Based on previous experimental work, we started to use cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts for this indication 15 years ago. To evaluate their outcome, we performed a retrospective study of those bypasses with distal anastomosis on a crural or pedal vessel.\nBetween November 1991 and December 2005, 108 cryopreserved great saphenous vein allografts were implanted for in 92 patients (42 women, 50 men) with a mean age of 71 years (range, 39-88 years). All patients received low-dose immunosuppressive therapy for up to 1 year after intervention. Follow-up was conducted until amputation, death, or the end of the study in March 2007.\nNondiabetic atherosclerosis the cause of CLI in 57%, 41% had diabetes, and 2% had Buerger disease. Forty-one conduits were performed for primary reconstructions and 67 for redo reconstructions. During a mean follow-up of 26.4 months, 69 occlusions occurred. Primary and secondary patency rates were 56% and 73% at 1 year, 32% and 60% at 3 years, and 17% and 38.5% at 5 years. Survival rates were 87.4% at 1 year and 64.5% at 5 years. At multivariate analysis, the intake of statins was predictive for improved patency (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; P = .024) and for prolonged survival (HR, 0.335; P = .045). The presence of diabetes showed a trend for inferior patency (HR, 2.325; P = .116) and for decreased amputation risk (HR, 0.592; P = .078).\nCryopreserved saphenous vein allografts are a valuable alternative to prosthetic materials when autologous veins are not available. Our limb salvage and patency rates are higher then those described for prosthetic grafts at the infrapopliteal level in most studies. Moreover, these grafts are resistant to infection when performed for revascularization in patients with an infected ulcer. Better graft and patient selection, better graft surveillance and immunologic matching, and standard use of statins could possibly improve the results even further. Shortage in availability might be a limiting factor for their widespread use.",

    "conclusions": "Cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts are a valuable alternative to prosthetic materials when autologous veins are not available. Our limb salvage and patency rates are higher then those described for prosthetic grafts at the infrapopliteal level in most studies. Moreover, these grafts are resistant to infection when performed for revascularization in patients with an infected ulcer. Better graft and patient selection, better graft surveillance and immunologic matching, and standard use of statins could possibly improve the results even further. Shortage in availability might be a limiting factor for their widespread use.",

    "abstract": "The predefined duration to arbitrarily stop the tests during constant-load treadmill exercise is a subject of debate and widely variable in the literature. We hypothesized that the upper and lower limits for predefined durations of constant-load 3.2 km/hour 10% grade tests could be derived from the distribution of walking distances observed on a treadmill in a population of subjects referred for claudication or from the optimal cutoff point distance on a treadmill to confirm a limitation self-reported by history.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis using a referral center, institutional practice, and ambulatory patients. We studied 1290 patients (86% male), 62.1 +/- 11.2 years of age, 169 +/- 8 cm height, 75.7 +/- 14.2 kg weight. Patients performed a standard constant-load treadmill test: 3.2 km hour(-1), 10% slope, maximized to 1000 meters (approximately 20 minutes). We analyzed the maximal walking distance self-reported (MWD(SR)) by history and the maximal walking distance measured on the treadmill (MWD(TT)). Patients reporting MWD(SR) >or=1000 meters were considered unlimited by history.\nOnly 197 patients (15.3%) completed the 20-minute treadmill test. Among the 504 patients who did not stop before 250 meters, 47.8% stopped within the next 250 meters (were unable to walk 500 meters). This proportion falls to 7.5% among the 213 patients who did not stop before 750 meters. When the final goal was to estimate whether the treadmill test can discriminate patients with or without limitation by history, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.809 +/- 0.016 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.778-0.841; P < .0001), the best diagnostic performance was attained for an MWD(TT) of 299 meters (approximately 6.15 minutes).\nIn patients undergoing constant-load treadmill exercise with a protocol of 3.2 km hour(-1) and 10% slope: a predefined duration of 7 minutes could be proposed as a lower limit for the predefined duration of the tests specifically if one aims at confirming the limitation by history with treadmill testing. Owing to the low risk that patients that could walk 750 meters (approximately 15 minutes) will have to stop in the next 250 meters, 15 minutes seems a reasonable upper limit for the predefined test duration in clinical routine.",

    "abstract": "The study tested the feasibility of using a new portable mechanical compression device for the treatment of claudication. The device applies intermittent non-pneumatic mechanical compression (IMC) to the calf. It was hypothesized that it can offer a low-cost convenient option for patients and achieve good compliance and improved clinical outcomes.\nThirty patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled single blind study. Fourteen patients were assigned to active IMC. Sixteen control patients continued with medical treatment alone. Outcomes were recorded at baseline, after one month, three months, and six months. The study examined changes in exercise tolerance using Initial Claudiacation Distance (ICD) and Absolute Claudiaction Distance (ACD) as well as ankle-brachial index at rest (ABI-r) and post-exercise (ABI-pe). All patients had stable claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and were already under best medical treatment (BMT). To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to be between the ages of 50 and 75 years, had to have stable claudication with an absolute claudication distance >40 meters but <300 meters on a standardized treadmill stress test (3.8 km/h at a 10% grade), have a resting ABI in the affected limb <0.8 with a drop of at least 0.15 following exercise, in whom surgical intervention was not expected for at least three months. Fourteen patients were assigned to active IMC consisting of compressions 65 mm Hg in amplitude, applied for three 3-second compressions/minute, two hours/day for three months. Sixteen control patients continued with BMT alone.\nOne month after treatment, ICD increased by 66% (P = .001), ACD increased by 51.75% (P = .005), and ABI-pe increased by 42% (P = .01). Treatment effects were maintained or further improved after three months. ABI-r did not increase at any time. Compliance exceeded 80%. Three months following cessation of therapy, claudication distances and ABI-pe did not decrease significantly.\nWe concluded that the use of IMC of the calf for three months increased claudication distances and led to objective improvements in ABI-pe. Intermittent mechanical compression may be a useful approach to patients with continued claudication despite standard medical treatment.",

    "abstract": "We report our clinical experience with the use of a sutureless telescoping anastomosis, initially described as the VORTEC (Viabahn Open Rebranching TEChnique) revascularization technique, for debranching of supra-aortic vessels.\nBetween May 2005 and December 2008, 20 patients (15 men) with an aortic arch lesion underwent trans-sternal debranching with sutureless telescoping anastomosis performed with a Viabahn (diameter, 5-8 mm; length, 5-15 cm) or Hemobahn (diameter, 9-13 mm; length, 10-15 cm), followed by endovascular aneurysm repair. Initially, the Viabahn/Hemobahn was sutured to a feeding graft after deployment. Since 2008, the Viabahn/Hemobahn has been deployed within an interposition graft, rendering unnecessary the anastomosis. The underlying aortic pathology was (1) isolated aortic arch aneurysm in 10, (2) aortic arch aneurysm extending to the ascending or descending aorta in 6, (3) floating thrombus within the aortic arch in 1, (4) acute aortic arch dissection in 1, and (5) Crawford II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm extending into the aortic arch in 2. Postprocedural duplex ultrasound imaging showed normal flow profiles in all patients. Follow-up included computed tomography angiography at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, and then annually.\nOverall, 56 supra-aortic vessels in the 20 patients were debranched by sutureless telescoping anastomosis, including the carotid artery in 18, subclavian artery in 13, and left vertebral artery in 1. Technical success was 100%. The mean ischemia time was 3 minutes (range, 1-9 minutes) for the debranching procedure vs 6 minutes (range, 5-16 minutes) for a conventional suture anastomosis. The 30-day mortality rate was 15% (3 if 20); 28.5% (2 of 7) in urgent cases and 7.6% (1 of 12) in elective patients. Three patients (15%) had neurologic deficits after debranching in the conventionally-sutured anastomosis territories. No early (<30 days) occlusion occurred. During a mean follow-up of 14 +/- 9 months (range, 1-39 months), one patient with Takayasu disease showed asymptomatic occlusion of a Viabahn implanted into the left common carotid artery. Stenosis in the aortic anastomosis of the bypass graft in another patient was successfully treated by angioplasty and stent placement through the right brachial artery.\nSutureless telescoping anastomosis with a Viabahn or a Hemobahn in supra-aortic debranching seems to be a safe and reliable alternative to sutured anastomosis. It enables safe and fast-track revascularizations, especially in anatomically challenging situations, and requires a very short ischemia time. Questions about long-term results and the technique reproducibility must be addressed.",

    "abstract": "The presence of penetrating aortic ulcers (PAUs) of the descending thoracic aorta has been associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Although early results have suggested acceptable outcomes for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for PAU, few studies have described the late outcomes of this approach.\nFrom 1993 to 2009, 37 patients (43.2% male; mean age, 72 years) underwent TEVAR for PAU. Associated intramural hematoma was present in 19. Comorbidities included hypertension in 31, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 16, coronary artery disease in 22, and renal failure (mean preoperative creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL). Urgent or emergent indications were identified in 22 patients (59.5%), including presentation with rupture in 15 (40.5%).\nTEVAR was successfully performed in all patients. Arch repair was performed in 14 and total descending repair in 13. Concomitant procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and total arch debranching in one patient electively presenting with an asymptomatic PAU. Early morbidity included stroke (5.4%), temporary paraplegia (5.4%), and need for dialysis (2.7%). In-hospital or 30-day mortality was seen in two patients (5.4%). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, median survival was 89.8 months. Independent predictors of late mortality included urgent or emergent presentation (odds ratio, 14.7; P = .007). Actuarial freedom from TEVAR treatment failure (ie, need for open or endovascular aortic reintervention, aortic rupture, or aortic-related death) was 81.6% +/- 7.8% at 5 years. Analysis stratified by type of pathology (PAU vs PAU and intramural hematoma) showed no significant baseline differences in age, comorbidities, or extent of repair. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, however, presentation with PAU and intramural hematoma was associated with an increased risk for TEVAR treatment failure (P = .033).\nTEVAR can be safely accomplished for patients presenting with PAU. The presence of associated intramural hematoma may adversely affect the late outcomes of therapy, highlighting the need for careful planning, prudent balancing of the benefits of immediate vs delayed treatment of the fragile aortic wall, and the imperative nature of attentive follow-up in patients with PAU.",

    "abstract": "This study presented and validated a new standardized method for the measurement of the aortic angulation in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and quantified the observer variability.\nA standardized method to quantify aortic angulation was introduced. To measure aortic angulation, a center lumen line (CLL) of the aorta was made, and a three-dimensional (3D) aortic reconstruction was obtained. The 3D reconstruction was turned 360 degrees perpendicular to the CLL in the middle of the flexure. The sharpest angle of the CLL was considered the true angle of the aortic axis. The computed tomography angiography data sets of 20 patients scheduled for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) were obtained. The angles between the suprarenal aorta and the aneurysm neck (alpha) and between the aneurysm neck and sac (beta) were measured. Two observers independently measured the angles. Differences of each pair of measurements were plotted against their mean and intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were calculated according to Bland and Altman.\nThe intraobserver mean difference for angle alpha was -0.2 degrees (-0.5%), with a repeatability coefficient (RC) of 6.4 degrees (20.2%), and 0.6 degrees (1.4%) for angle beta, with a RC of 6.2 degrees (13.4%). The interobserver mean difference for angle alpha was -1.5 degrees (-4.5%), with a RC of 6.9 degrees (22.0%), and -0.2 degrees (-0.4%) for angle beta, with a RC of 7.4 degrees (16.0%). No significant differences were observed between the observers.\nThe presented technique to objectively quantify the angulation of the aneurysm neck is easy to perform and reliable. This method showed good intraobserver and interobserver variability and should therefore be the standard when measuring and reporting aortic angulation.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated stent grafting has allowed the treatment of complex thoraco-abdominal aneurysm disease via a totally endovascular approach, but the procedure can be technically challenging and time consuming. We investigated whether this procedure may be enhanced by remotely steerable robotic endovascular catheters.\nA four-vessel fenestrated stent graft partially deployed within a computed tomography (CT)-reconstructed pulsatile thoraco-abdominal aneurysm silicon model was used. Fifteen operators were recruited to participate in the study and divided into three groups, based on their endovascular experience: group A (n = 4, 100-200 endovascular procedures, group B (n = 5, 200-300), and group C (n = 6, >300). All operators were asked to cannulate the renal and visceral vessels under fluoroscopic guidance, using conventional and robotic techniques. Quantitative (catheterization times and wire/catheter tip movements) and qualitative metrics (procedure-specific-rating scale [IC3ST]), which grades operators on catheter use, instrumentation, successful cannulation/catheterization, and overall performance were compared.\nMedian procedure time for cannulation of all four vessels was reduced using the robotic system (2.87 min, interquartile range [IQR; 2.20-3.90] versus 17.24 min [11.90-19.80]; P < .001) for each individual operator, regardless of the level of endovascular experience. The total number of wire/catheter movements taken to complete the task was also significantly reduced (38, IQR [29-57] versus 454 [283-687]; P < .001). There were significant differences in time and movement for cannulation of each individual vessel in the phantom. Robotic catheter operator radiation exposure was negligible as the robotic workstation is remote and away from the radiation source. Overall performance scores significantly improved using the robotic system, despite minimal operator exposure to this technology (IC3ST score 29/35, IQR [22.8-30.7] versus 19/35 [13-24.3]; P = .002). Each group of operators demonstrated an improvement in performance with robotic cannulation. For group A, median IC3ST score was 28/35, IQR (22-33) versus 15/35 (11-20); P = .04; for group B, 30/35 (27-31) versus 19/35 (18-24); P = .07; and for group C, 28.8/35 (28.5-29) versus 22/35 (16-24); P = .06. For groups B and C, these differences did not reach statistical significance.\nRobotic catheterization of target vessels during this procedure is feasible and minimizes radiation exposure for the operator. Steerable robotic catheters with intuitive control may overcome some of the limitations of standard catheter technology, enhance target vessel cannulation, reduce instrumentation, and improve overall performance scores.",

    "abstract": "Highly variable utilization rates for a diverse group of surgical procedures are commonly ascribed to physician practice patterns rather than clinical considerations. A previous investigation by our group showed that variations in the rates of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) actually reflected regional risk factors for atherosclerosis, not physician density or other socio-economic drivers. In this study, we examine the use of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) over six years to test our hypothesis that the utilization of innovative vascular procedures by vascular surgeons more closely reflects disease prevalence and consistent clinical judgment than non-medical factors.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Samples and State Inpatient Databases (2001-2006) were accessed to document the number and type of aneurysm repairs (EVAR versus open). Multiple metrics pertaining to clinical risk factors, socioeconomic status, access to care, provider distribution, and local healthcare capacity were quantitated for each state. We performed bivariate analysis, Pearson (PC) or Spearman (SC) correlations, and multiple regression modeling.\nThe total number of aneurysms repaired has not changed significantly (from 45,828 in 2001 to 45,111 in 2006). Over the same interval, the number of open AAA repair nationwide decreased by 48% while the number of AAA repaired endovascularly increased by 105%. In 2005, the utilization rate of EVAR among 29 states ranged widely from 39.3% to 69.9%. Use of EVAR was highest in states with higher incidences of aneurysms (PC = 0.43, P < .05), greater number of deaths from heart disease (PC = 0.42, P < .05), greater number of diabetes discharges (PC = 0.48, P < .005), higher number of carotid stenosis discharges (PC = 0.40, P < .05), and higher number of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) discharges (SC = 0.43, P < .05). Regional malpractice pressure, specifically the number of paid claims and mean malpractice premium, both exhibited positive correlations with the EVAR rate. The number of physicians, vascular surgeons, hospital beds, teaching hospitals, or trauma centers did not predict high utilization of EVAR nor did the other socio-economic indices tested.\nWhile there was substantial regional variation in the use of EVAR, utilization of the less morbid procedure was well correlated with higher risk populations (number of diabetic patients and deaths secondary to heart disease). Contrary to other studies of regional discrepancies in the utilization of some surgical procedures, it appears that the utilization of EVAR was not associated with physician distribution, socioeconomics, or other non-medical factors.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of endovascular exclusion of popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) using stent grafts.\nThe clinical data of all patients who underwent endovascular exclusion of PAA at three French vascular departments between December 1999 and December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Outcome measures included graft patency and endoleak. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the primary and secondary patency curves.\nA total of 57 PAA in 50 patients (48 men; mean age, 72 +/- 11 years; range, 57-96 years) were treated. The type of stent graft used was Hemobahn/Viabahn in 42 (73.7%) cases, Wallgraft in 14 (24.5%) and Passager in one. The mean duration of hospitalization was 5 +/- 1.8 days (range, 3-11 days). No patients were lost from follow up (mean, 36 +/- 19.4 months; range, 6-96 months). Nine (16%) occlusions and six (10.5%) endoleaks occurred. The global limb salvage rate was 96.5% (55 of 57 PAA). Kaplan-Meier estimates for primary and secondary patency were 85.8% and 87.5% at one year and 82.3% and 87.5% at three years.\nEndovascular treatment of PAA is feasible in selected patients. The main determinants of success are suitable aneurysm anatomy and dual antiplatelet postoperative therapy. Further studies are warranted to determine long-term outcomes of endovascular repair for PAA.",

We considered a hospitalization an acute admission for PAD if (1) the primary diagnosis was PAD, and (2) the patient was admitted urgently or emergently or through an emergency department. Vascular interventions were designated as open bypass, endovascular intervention, or major amputation, defined as disarticulation at the ankle or higher amputation.\nFrom 1998 through 2006, the likelihood of an endovascular procedure being performed during an acute hospitalization for PAD increased from 11.5% to 35.3%, and open vascular procedures decreased from 34.9% to 25.4%. The likelihood of a major amputation during an acute hospitalization for PAD decreased from 29.7% to 20.3%. Black and Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to undergo amputation and were less likely to have an endovascular or open revascularization.\nUse of endovascular procedures has increased and use of open vascular bypass has decreased in the inpatient treatment of acute PAD.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated gender-specific trends in the diagnosis and treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) in the United States Medicare population.\nThe Medicare beneficiary database (1995 through 2006) was examined for patients with rAAAs using International Classification of Diseaes, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Codes for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) were only available for the year 2000 forward, and thus, analysis of EVAR was limited to 2000 through 2006. Proportions were analyzed by chi(2) and continuous variables by t-test. Factors associated with 30-day mortality and discharge home after surgery were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. The effect of gender and repair type (open or EVAR) on death and the probability of discharge to home after repair were also evaluated.\nThe rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for men decreased by 52% (from 40 to 19) and by 36% for women (from 11 to 7). The observed 30-day mortality rate was overall 7.7% higher for women vs men. The mortality rate for women was higher by 8.9% for open repair and higher by 7.1% for EVAR vs men. Female gender was associated with increased risk of death in multivariate analysis after controlling for age, year, and type of procedure. Women were 9.8% less likely to be discharged to home after rAAA repair, regardless of the type of repair.\nIn addition to the fact that we have failed to realize a change in the number of women diagnosed with or treated for rAAA, a significant gender difference remains in the outcomes after treatment for rAAA. This differential is present in both the 30-day mortality rate and in the potential to be discharged to home after repair.",

    "abstract": "Angiography remains a critical component for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic intervention in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The goal of this study was to compare angiography with corresponding intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging of the same vessels in patients with PAD.\nFrom 2004 to 2008, 93 patients undergoing angiography for PAD were recruited in a prospective observational analysis. At the time of angiography, diseased lower extremities were interrogated using a 10-cm IVUS pullback with registration points. IVUS data were analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for vessel and lumen diameter, plaque volume, plaque composition, and cross-sectional area. Similarly, three vascular surgeons blinded to the IVUS data graded corresponding angiographic images according to vessel diameter, degree of stenosis, degree of calcification, and extent of eccentricity. Statistical analyses of matched IVUS images and angiograms were performed.\nThe distribution of demographic and risk variables were typical for PAD: 54% male, 96% hypertension, 78% hyperlipidemia, 44% diabetic, 87% tobacco history, 65% coronary artery disease, and 10% end-stage renal disease. Symptoms precipitating the angiographic evaluation included claudication (53%), rest pain (18%), and tissue loss (29%). Angiographic and IVUS interpretation were similar for luminal diameters, but external vessel diameter was greater by IVUS imaging (7.0 +/- 0.7 vs 5.2 +/- 0.8 mm, P < .05). The two-dimensional diameter method resulted in a significant correlation for stenosis determination (r = 0.84); however, IVUS determination of vessel area stenosis was greater by 10% (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-21%, P < .05). IVUS imaging indicated that a higher proportion of plaques were concentric. Grading of calcification was moderate to severe in 40% by angiography but in only 7% by IVUS (P < .05).\nIn the evaluation of PAD, angiography and IVUS imaging provide similar luminal diameters and diameter-reducing stenosis measurements. Determination of overall vessel diameter and interpretation of plaque morphology by angiography are discordant from IVUS-derived data.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to report our experience in the repair of renal artery aneurysms using robot-assisted surgery.\nBetween December 2002 and March 2009, five women with a mean age of 63.8 years (range, 57-78 years) underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic repair of renal artery aneurysms by the same surgeon at two different institutions, the Department of General Surgery, Misericordia Hospital, Grosseto, Italy (three patients) and the Division of Minimally Invasive and Robotic Surgery at the University of Illinois, Chicago (two patients). The mean size of the lesions was 19.4 mm (range, 9-28 mm). Four of the lesions were complex aneurysms involving the renal artery bifurcation. Two patients were symptomatic and three had hypertension. In situ repair by aneurysmectomy was performed in all cases, followed by revascularization. In complex aneurysms, an autologous saphenous vein graft was used for the reconstruction.\nThe mean operative time was 288 minutes (range, 170-360 min) and the estimated surgical blood loss was 100 ml (range, 50-300 ml). Warm ischemia time was 10 minutes in the patient treated by aneurysmectomy, followed by direct reconstruction. The average warm ischemia time was 38.5 minutes (range, 20-60 min) for patients treated with saphenous vein graft interposition. The mean time to resume a regular diet was 1.6 days (range, 1-2 days). The mean postoperative length of hospital stay was 5.6 days (range, 3-7 days). No postoperative morbidity was noted. The mean follow-up time for the entire series was 28 months (range, 6-48 months). Color Doppler ultrasonography examination showed patency in all reconstructed vessels. One patient had stenosis of one of the reconstructed branches, which was treated with percutaneous angioplasty.\nRobot-assisted laparoscopic repair of renal artery aneurysms is feasible, safe and effective. The technical advantages of the robotic system allows for microvascular reconstruction to be performed using a minimally invasive approach, even in complex cases. This approach may also allow for improved postoperative recovery and reduce the morbidity correlated with open repair of renal artery aneurysms. Although more experience and technical refinements are necessary, robot-assisted laparoscopic repair of renal artery aneurysms represents a valid alternative to open surgery.",

    "abstract": "Demographic and practice modality changes during the past decade have led to a substantial shift in the management of peripheral vascular disease. This study examined the effect of these changes using large national and regional data sets on procedure type, indications, morbidity, and on the primary target outcome: limb salvage.\nNational Inpatient Sample (NIS) data sets and New York (NY) State inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient surgeries discharge databases from 1998 through 2007 were used to identify hospitalizations for lower extremity revascularization (LER) and major amputations. Patients were selected by cross-referencing diagnostic and procedural codes. Proportions were analyzed by chi(2) analysis, continuous variables by t test, and trends by the Poisson regression.\nThe national per capita (100,000 population, age >40 years) volume of major amputations decreased by 38%. The volume for national and regional use of endovascular LER doubled. The volume of open LER decreased by 67% from 1998 through 2007. Ambulatory endovascular LER grew in NY State from 7 per capita in 1998 to 22 in 2007. Interventions declined by 20% (93 to 75) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) but increased by nearly 50% for claudication. Outpatient data analysis revealed a fivefold increase in vascular interventions for CLI and claudication. Nationally, endovascular LER interventions quadrupled (8% to 32%) for CLI and doubled (26% to 61%) for claudication. A parallel reduction occurred in major amputations for patients with CLI (42% to 30%), for other PAD diagnoses (18% to 14%), and for claudication (0.9% to 0.3%). Although surgical interventions for CLI declined significantly for octogenarians from 317 to 240, outpatient interventions increased for CLI, claudication, and other diagnoses in all age groups. Comorbidities for patients treated in 2006 were substantially greater than those of a decade ago. For most procedures, cardiac and bleeding complications have significantly decreased during the last decade. Length of stay (LOS) declined from 9.5 to 7.6 days and the percentage of short (1-2 day) hospitalizations increased from 16% to 35%.\nAlthough patients today, whether treated for claudication or CLI, have more comorbidities, the rates of amputation, the procedural morbidity and mortality, and LOS have all significantly decreased. Other variables, including changes in medical management and wound care, undoubtedly are important, but this change appears to be largely due to the widespread and successful use of endovascular LER or to earlier intervention, or both, driven by the safety of these techniques.",

Although surgical interventions for CLI declined significantly for octogenarians from 317 to 240, outpatient interventions increased for CLI, claudication, and other diagnoses in all age groups. Comorbidities for patients treated in 2006 were substantially greater than those of a decade ago. For most procedures, cardiac and bleeding complications have significantly decreased during the last decade. Length of stay (LOS) declined from 9.5 to 7.6 days and the percentage of short (1-2 day) hospitalizations increased from 16% to 35%.",

    "abstract": "The association between carotid plaque calcification and clinical ischemic events is unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically review published studies comparing degree of calcification between clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques.\nA systematic search for relevant studies was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. For studies reporting a rating scale or a continuous measure of calcification, study-specific and pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques were calculated. For studies reporting a dichotomous measure, study-specific and pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. If no significant heterogeneity was present (I(2) <or=50%), a fixed-effects pooling model was used. If significant heterogeneity was present (I(2) >50%), a random-effects pooling model was used, and sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analyses.\nThe 24 studies included in this systematic review used a wide range of methodologies to quantify degree of calcification and a wide range of definitions to define clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques. Pooled fixed-effects SMD of calcification volume or weight between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques was -0.425 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.608 to -0.241); I(2) = 39.3%. Pooled random-effects SMD of calcification percentage was -0.997 (95% CI, -1.793 to -0.200); I(2) = 93.8. Subgroup analyses did not reveal homogeneous subgroups. Pooled fixed-effects OR for the association between high degree of plaque calcification and symptoms was 0.696 (95% CI, 0.528 to 0.918); I(2) = 21.1%.\nThe results of this systematic review suggest that clinically symptomatic plaques have a lower degree of calcification than asymptomatic plaques. Assessment of degree of carotid plaque calcification may be useful to predict which plaques will cause cerebrovascular ischemic events.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair is an established modality of treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms. It is therefore reasonable to expect its application to other less common aneurysmal conditions, including isolated iliac and popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA). There are, however, essential differences between aortic aneurysms and peripheral aneurysms: smaller arterial caliber, mobility of the arterial segment, associated occlusive disease, and devices that have not been specifically designed for peripheral applications. Due to these differences, results obtained in abdominal aortic aneurysms cannot be extrapolated to peripheral aneurysms. The attraction of the endovascular repair for PAA is its minimally invasive nature. The literature, however, provides only case reports, case series and small cohorts, and one small randomized, controlled trial. A cumulative summary of these studies provides the clinician with information upon which to base the choice of treatment on a specific patient. Endovascular repair for PAA with suitable anatomy and good run-off can be considered safe, and medium term results appear comparable with those of open repair.",

    "abstract": "Varicose veins are a frequent burden, also in the small saphenous system. Yet its basic anatomy is not described consistently. We therefore investigated the fascial and neural relationships of the small saphenous vein (SSV) as well as the frequency and position of valves and the different junctional patterns, also considering the thigh extension.\nWe dissected the legs of 51 cadavers during the regular dissection course held in winter 2007 at Innsbruck Medical University, with a total of 86 SSVs investigable proximally and 94 SSVs distally.\nA distinct saphenous fascia is present in 93 of 94 cases. It starts with a mean distance of 5.1 cm (SD 1.2 cm) proximal to the calcaneal tuber, where the tributaries to the SSV join to form a common trunk. The neural topography at the level of the gastrocnemius muscle's origins shows the medial sural cutaneous nerve in 88% medially and in 12% laterally to the SSV, the tibial nerve in 64% medially and in 36% laterally, and the common fibular nerve in 98% medially and in 2% laterally to the vein. The saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) resembled in about 37% type A (UIP-classification), 15% type B, and 24% type C. A total of 17% of specimens showed a venous web or star at the popliteal fossa and 6% had a doubled junction. A thigh extension could be demonstrated in about 84%. A most proximal valve was present in only 94% at a mean distance of 1.2 cm (SD 1.4 cm) to the SSVs orifice. A consecutive distal valve was only present in 65% with a mean distance of 5.1 cm (SD 2.3 cm).\nTwo fascial points or regions can be described in the SSVs' course and its own saphenous fascia is demonstrated macroscopically in almost all cases. The neural topography is highly individual. The SPJ is highly individual where we found hitherto unclassified patterns in a remarkable number of veins. Venous valves are not as frequent as we supposed them to be. Furthermore, not all most proximal valves seem to be terminal valves.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy for symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is common and effective in the well-selected patient. Hypertension is a common indication for intervention and a major component of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The impact of MetS on outcomes after percutaneous renal intervention is unknown.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent endovascular intervention for ARAS and were followed by duplex ultrasound between January 1990 and January 2008. MetS was defined as the presence of >or=3 of the following criteria: Blood pressure >or=140 mm Hg/>or=90 mm Hg; triglycerides >or=150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein <or=50 mg/dL for women and <or=40 mg/dL for men; fasting blood glucose >or=110 mg/dL; or body mass index >or=30 kg/m(2). The average follow-up period was 3.3 years. Clinical benefit defined as freedom from renal-related morbidity (increase in persistent creatinine >20% of baseline, progression to hemodialysis, death from renal-related causes) or freedom from recurrent hypertension, anatomic patency, restenosis, and patient survival were measured.\nFive hundred ninety-two renal artery interventions were performed in 427 patients. Fifty-two percent were identified as having MetS. Patients with MetS were more often female (35% vs 50%, NoMetS vs MetS). There were no significant differences in presenting symptoms. There was no peri-operative mortality and equivalent morbidity (6% vs 7%, NoMetS vs MetS). Patients with MetS had equivalent survival and cumulative patency. However, the MetS group had a lower five-year freedom from restenosis (87+/-2% vs 69+/-9%, NoMetS vs MetS; P < .01) and lower five-year retained clinical benefit (71+/-8% vs 45+/-8%, NoMetS vs MetS; P < .01) with a higher number progressing to hemodialysis (3% vs 13%, NoMetS vs MetS; P < .01). Individually, the components of MetS did not influence outcomes. Statin therapy did not influence outcomes.\nMetS is associated with markedly reduced renal clinical benefit and increased progression to hemodialysis following endovascular intervention for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. MetS is thus a risk factor for poor long-term outcomes following renal interventions.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent public health problem associated with major detrimental effects on quality of life and functional status, and it is also the main cause of limb amputation. More importantly, PAD has been classified as a coronary artery disease equivalent, meaning that patients with a diagnosis of PAD carry a risk for major coronary events equal to that of established coronary artery disease. PAD is also a potent predictor of stroke and death. Despite its frequent occurrence (8 to 10 million Americans are affected), little is known about the natural history of PAD in racial/ethnic minorities, particularly in Hispanics, who represent 12.5% of the United States population. Furthermore, the disease is commonly underdiagnosed and undertreated in this minority group, and outcomes are poorer in Hispanics as compared with whites. Limited access to health care, difficulties for recruitment in population-based studies, and limitations of the noninvasive screening tests are well-established barriers to determine the prevalence and natural history of PAD in Hispanics. Although the most widely used test for assessment of patients at risk for PAD is the ankle-brachial index (ABI), the test has substantial limitations in individuals with diabetes and arterial calcification, which are highly prevalent in Hispanics. The ABI should, therefore, be supplemented by the use of other noninvasive tests, such as the pulse volume recordings (PVR) and toe-brachial index. Besides the use of a combination of diagnostic techniques, the implementation of a research methodology that improves recruitment of Hispanics in population-based studies is necessary to obtain better knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease in this group. Community-based participatory research may be the most appropriate approach to study this ethnic minority because it overcomes barriers for limited access to health care and increases the possibility of overcoming distrust of research on the part of communities. Understanding the epidemiology of PAD to improve its detection and treatment among Hispanics is relevant to reduce disparities in the health status of this group, the most rapidly growing ethnic minority in the United States.",

    "abstract": "To investigate changes in aortic diameter in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients and the implications for sizing of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with traumatic thoracic aortic injury (TTAI).\nWe retrospectively evaluated all trauma patients that were admitted with hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure <95 mm Hg and a pulse >or=100 beats/min) and underwent computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen both at admission and at another moment (control CT scan), at the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2002 and 2009. The CT examinations were reviewed in a blinded fashion and the aortic diameter was measured at six different levels by a cardiovascular radiologist. Differences in aortic diameter between the initial CTs obtained in the trauma bay and the control CTs were compared using the paired Student t test.\nForty-three patients were identified, including 32 males. Mean age was 37 +/- 16 years, mean injury severity score was 26 +/- 15, the mean pulse and blood pressure were 122 beats/min and 103/63 mm Hg, respectively. Overall, the mean aortic diameter was significantly larger at the control CT examinations compared with the initial CT examinations while hemodynamically unstable, at all evaluated levels. Among patients with a pulse >or=130/min, the mean increase in aortic diameter was most consistent at the level of the mid descending thoracic aorta (DTA, +12.6%, P = .003) and at the level of the infrarenal aorta (+12.6%, P = .004).\nThe aortic diameter decreases dramatically in trauma patients with hemodynamic instability. This decrease in aortic diameter could theoretically lead to inaccurate aortic measurements and undersizing of the endograft in hemodynamically unstable TTAI patients requiring TEVAR. Further research is needed to better predict the actual aortic diameters in individual hemodynamically unstable patients requiring endovascular aortic repair.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysms are characterized by extravascular circulation and therefore may lead to an activation of the coagulation cascade. We investigated d-dimer levels in patients with and without postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms and hypothesized that d-dimer levels correlate with the presence of pseudoaneurysms at the vascular access site.\nPatients with clinical suspected groin pseudoaneurysms after transluminal procedures were eligible. We compared prospectively-collected laboratory values of quantitative d-dimer testing in patients with and without pseudoaneurysms as assessed by color-coded duplex sonography. Furthermore, we measured the peak systolic velocity at the arterial fistula of each pseudoaneurysm.\nIn 48 (40%) of 120 consecutive patients, a pseudoaneurysm was found. The level of d-dimer values was significantly higher in patients with postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms compared with controls (1.9 microg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 1.34-2.78 microg/mL] vs 0.8 microg/mL [IQR, 0.53-1.14 microg/mL]; P < .001). Values of d-dimer below 0.67 microg/mL have been calculated with a sensitivity of 94% (87%-100%), a specificity of 38% (27%-50%), a positive predictive value of 50% (40%-60%), a negative predictive value of 90% (82%-99%), and a likelihood ratio of 1.52 (1.25-1.85) with regard to the presence of pseudoaneurysms. We also found a significant correlation of the peak systolic velocity at the arterial fistula and increasing d-dimer levels (r = 0.98, P < .0001).\nWe found a significantly higher level of d-dimer values in patients with femoral pseudoaneurysms at the vascular access site.

    "abstract": "Aggressive endoluminal therapy for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease is commonplace, but the outcomes of current management of recurrent disease have not been well defined. This study examined the outcomes of endoluminal and open interventions for recurrent SFA disease.\nA database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA between 1986 and 2008 was retrospectively queried, and those with recurrent disease were selected. Outcomes were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used for time-dependent variables.\nSymptomatic SFA disease resulted in endovascular treatment in 735 limbs in 631 patients (64% male; average age, 67 years). The restenosis rate was 16% +/- 3% at 5 years. Restenosis developed in 222 patients, of whom 58 remained asymptomatic and 164 underwent repeat intervention comprising percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in 59% and bypass in 41%. Bypass was used for critical ischemia (rest pain/tissue loss: 52% repeat PTA vs 75% bypass) and in more extensive recurrent disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus [TASC] II C/D lesions: 42% repeat PTA vs 67% bypass). Primary and repeat PTA had mean +/- standard error of the mean equivalent cumulative patency (73% +/- 9% vs 73% +/- 3% at 5 years) and duration of symptom relief (66% +/- 3% vs 63% +/- 6%). Bypass had significantly superior outcomes for patency (93% +/- 8%) and symptom relief (81% +/- 8%), but morbidity was 28% vs 16% for PTA. Critical ischemia, TASC-II lesion (C/D), and one-vessel tibial runoff were significant predictors of failure in the repeat PTA group.\nReintervention is required in a minority of patients selected for SFA angioplasty. Bypass for recurrent disease is used more commonly for extensive disease and is associated with superior long-term outcomes but higher mortality. Bypass rather than repeat PTA may be the better strategy for progressive, complex recurrent disease.",

Restenosis developed in 222 patients, of whom 58 remained asymptomatic and 164 underwent repeat intervention comprising percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in 59% and bypass in 41%. Bypass was used for critical ischemia (rest pain/tissue loss: 52% repeat PTA vs 75% bypass) and in more extensive recurrent disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus [TASC] II C/D lesions: 42% repeat PTA vs 67% bypass). Primary and repeat PTA had mean +/- standard error of the mean equivalent cumulative patency (73% +/- 9% vs 73% +/- 3% at 5 years) and duration of symptom relief (66% +/- 3% vs 63% +/- 6%). Bypass had significantly superior outcomes for patency (93% +/- 8%) and symptom relief (81% +/- 8%), but morbidity was 28% vs 16% for PTA. Critical ischemia, TASC-II lesion (C/D), and one-vessel tibial runoff were significant predictors of failure in the repeat PTA group.",

    "abstract": "Replacing heparin with bivalirudin has been beneficial in patients undergoing coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass. The use of this alternative anticoagulant during peripheral bypass operations has not been studied. Concerns over distal thrombosis using this direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) prompted a single-arm, open-label, pilot prospective trial of bivalirudin in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass to assess perioperative safety and efficacy.\nBetween 2006 and 2007, 18 patients met criteria for enrollment and underwent primary lower extremity bypass using bivalirudin. All patients had severe symptomatic atherosclerotic disease requiring lower extremity bypass. Bivalirudin at a bolus dose of 0.75 mg/kg and continuous infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hr was used as the sole anticoagulant.\nPatients (mean age, 67 years) underwent femoral-popliteal (n = 14) or femoral-tibial (n = 4) bypass preferentially using saphenous vein (83%). Mean operative time was 261 minutes, with bivalirudin infusion time of 95 +/- 26 minutes (mean +/- standard deviation). Reliable anticoagulation was achieved with weight-based dosing with activated clotting time values at baseline (systemic) of 131 +/- 92 seconds, during infusion (systemic) of 347 +/- 36 seconds, and from the distal vasculature (limb) of 345 +/- 66 seconds. Distal limb bivalirudin levels were stable at 9755 +/- 3860 ng/mL during clamp occlusion. Mean estimated blood loss was 332 +/- 191 mL with four patients (22%) requiring blood products. One patient required revision of the proximal anastomosis during the initial hospitalization. At 30 days, all bypass operations were patent with improvement of mean ankle-brachial index from 0.57 to 0.81. There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions, or amputations in the 30-day postoperative period. Based on the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction classification for bleeding, one patient had major bleeding (>2 units of packed red blood cells), and three patients had minor bleeding within the first 30 days.\nBivalirudin is a safe and effective anticoagulant for lower extremity bypass operations. Thrombosis beyond the distal clamp was not seen. A comparative trial to standard anticoagulation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Persistent type 2 endoleaks (PT2, present >or=6 months) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are associated with adverse outcomes. This study evaluated the preoperative risk factors and natural history of PT2 in order to define a population at high risk.\nFrom January 1999 to December 2007, 595 of 832 EVAR patients had long-term computed tomography follow-up and comprised the study cohort. Preoperative anatomic and clinical variables were correlated with PT2 using Cox regression. Composite hazard ratios (HRs) were constructed with clusters of high-risk preoperative variables. Primary end points, including spontaneous resolution, sac enlargement >5 mm, and freedom from reintervention, were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nThere were 136 PT2 patients (23%) with a median follow-up of 34.8 months (range, 6.4-121.2 months). Positive predictive factors included patent inferior mesenteric artery (IMA; HR, 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-9.90; P = .003), increasing number of patent lumbar arteries (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10-1.41; P = .0006), increasing age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P = .005), and increasing luminal diameter on CT-contrast opacified lumen (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P = .0001). During follow-up, spontaneous PT2 resolution occurred in 34 patients (25%), sac diameter remained stable in 63 (46%), and rupture occurred in 2 (1.5%). Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that 35.2% +/- 5.6% (95% CI, 23.8%-46.2%) of PT2 resolve spontaneously at 5 years after the index procedure. Freedom from sac enlargement >5 mm was 54.6% +/- 7.2% (95% CI, 40.6%-69.4%) at 5 years. Fifty-nine reinterventions were performed in 39 patients with PT2. Freedom from reintervention was 67.3% +/- 5.0% (95% CI, 57.0%-77.0%) at 5 years. The combination of a patent IMA and one risk factor of more than six patent lumbar arteries, maximum luminal diameter >30 mm, or age >70 years increased the odds of PT2 approximately ninefold. The combination of a patent IMA and any two risk factors increased the odds of PT2 approximately 18-fold.\nSeveral readily identifiable preoperative variables are associated with PT2 whose natural history was benign in but 35% of patients. On the basis of the composite high-risk HRs, there is accordingly a cohort of patients in whom perioperative interventions to preclude PT2 should be considered.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed risk factors for mortality in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), including body mass index (BMI) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Risk factors for long-term survival are unclear in patients with PAD. The origin of the obesity paradox, a paradoxical decrease in mortality with increasing BMI, is also uncertain in these patients.\nA prospective cohort study was performed in 652 patients (aged 71.3 +/- 9.4 years old) with PAD.\nThe 1-, 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates were 94.5%, 70.4%, 45.2%, and 21.1%, respectively, in patients with intermittent claudication, and 72.7%, 27.2%, 11.6%, and 5.8%, respectively, in those with critical limb ischemia (CLI). In Cox multivariate analysis, a significant association with all-cause mortality was found for CLI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.931; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089-3.422; P = .024), diabetes (HR, 2.111; 95% CI, 1.247-3.572; P = .005), BMI (HR, 0.879; 95% CI, 0.804-0.962; P = .005), and eGFR (HR, 0.985; 95% CI, 0.971-0.998l; P = .028). These parameters were also significant risk factors for cardiovascular mortality. Fibrinogen (HR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005; P = .014) and cerebrovascular disease (HR, 1.730; 95% CI, 1.021-2.930; P = .045) were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality. The adjusted HR for mortality of BMI <21.5 vs >or=21.5 kg/m(2) was 1.772 (95% CI, 1.378-2.279; P < .001). BMI had positive correlations with triglyceride and albumin concentrations and negative correlations with the fibrinogen level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .005).\nLow BMI, eGFR, CLI, and diabetes are significant risk factors for mortality in PAD. The obesity paradox was verified and may be partly explained by low BMI mediated by malnutrition and systemic inflammation due to PAD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

In Cox multivariate analysis, a significant association with all-cause mortality was found for CLI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.931; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089-3.422; P = .024), diabetes (HR, 2.111; 95% CI, 1.247-3.572; P = .005), BMI (HR, 0.879; 95% CI, 0.804-0.962; P = .005), and eGFR (HR, 0.985; 95% CI, 0.971-0.998l; P = .028). These parameters were also significant risk factors for cardiovascular mortality. Fibrinogen (HR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005; P = .014) and cerebrovascular disease (HR, 1.730; 95% CI, 1.021-2.930; P = .045) were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality. The adjusted HR for mortality of BMI <21.5 vs >or=21.5 kg/m(2) was 1.772 (95% CI, 1.378-2.279; P < .001). BMI had positive correlations with triglyceride and albumin concentrations and negative correlations with the fibrinogen level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .005).",

    "abstract": "The initial treatment for intermittent claudication is supervised exercise therapy (SET). Owing to limited capacity and patient transports costs of clinic-based SET, a concept of SET provided by local physiotherapists was developed. We hypothesized that provision of daily feedback with an accelerometer in addition to SET would further increase walking distance.\nThis multicenter randomized trial was set in vascular surgery outpatient clinics and included 304 patients with intermittent claudication. Patients were randomized to exercise therapy in the form of \"go home and walk\" advice (WA), SET, or SET with feedback. Local physiotherapists provided SET. The primary outcome measure was the change in absolute claudication distance. Secondary outcomes were the change in functional claudication distance and results on the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey after 12 months.\nIn 11 centers, 102, 109, and 93 patients were included, respectively, in the WA, SET, and SET with feedback groups, and data for 83, 93, and 76, respectively, could be analyzed. The median (interquartile range) change in walking distance between 12 months and baseline in meters was 110 (0-300) in the WA group, 310 (145-995) in the SET group, and 360 (173-697) in the SET with feedback group (P < .001 WA vs SET). WIQ scores and relevant domains of the SF-36 improved statistically significantly in the SET groups.\nSET is more effective than WA in improving walking distance, WIQ scores, and quality of life for patients with intermittent claudication. Additional feedback with an accelerometer did not result in further improvement. SET programs should be made available for all patients with intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive long-term outcome data after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are scarce, although anecdotes of endograft failure in the early 1990s abound. The objective of this report is to provide comprehensive outcomes after EVAR performed with the earliest available endograft components. These were a home-made endograft (pre-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] fixed with giant Palmaz stents) and first-generation Talent endografts (World Medical, Sunrise, Fla).\nA prospectively recorded database of all cases undertaken at a tertiary referral center was retrospectively interrogated. Sex, age, types of endograft used, and fate of patient and endografts implanted between 10 and 15 years previously were studied. A literature search was undertaken to obtain data for long-term survival after EVAR and open surgery (OR).\nThere were 50 patients in total operated on between 1994 and 1998 of whom 43 were male. The median age was 73 years (54-93) at time of EVAR and 85 years (67-100) in the survivors at a median of 12 years later. There were 26 home-made (PTFE fixed with Palmaz stents) and 24 Talent endografts (World Medical). Thirty-day mortality was 4%, one death in a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Twenty-one (42%) survived for 12 years to the time of reporting. Of these, 6 have functioning home-made endografts, 8 have Talent endografts, and 8 (5 home-made and 3 Talent) survive after conversion to OR. Secondary interventions took place in 9 further patients. Of 27 late deaths, 1 suffered endograft sepsis, 20 died of cardio-respiratory causes and 6 died of cancer. The only report of more than a 10-year survival after OR was found in an e-publication from Sweden. The projected survival after 10 years was 40% for unruptured aneurysms. However, survival in the general population was higher at 60%.\nTen-year survival after EVAR parallels that of elective OR but is less than the general population. Although the rate of eventual conversion to open repair was high using this earliest available endograft technology, the aneurysm-related mortality was low, and both endografts remain functional for more than 10 years after placement.",

    "abstract": "To establish the relationship between quality of life (QOL) index scores and clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia.\nOne hundred seventy-eight patients (108 men, median age 70 years) with femoropopliteal lesions suitable for angioplasty were recruited. Assessments were performed prior to and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following intervention (angioplasty and/or supervised exercise program). Clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia (treadmill walking distances, ankle pressures), generic (SF36, EuroQol), and disease-specific (Kings College VascuQol) quality of life questionnaires were analyzed. Correlation analysis was performed for index scores (SF-6D, EQ-5D, VascuQol) and individual domain scores using nonparametric tests.\nAll clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia and quality of life index scores showed a statistically significant improvement as result of intervention (Friedman test, P < .001). Both generic QOL index scores (SF-6D, EQ-5D) showed moderate but statistically significant correlation (Spearman's rank correlation, P < .001) with treadmill walking distances (SF-6D r = 0.533, EQ-5D r = 0.500) and weak but significant correlation to resting and postexercise ankle-brachial pressure index (SF-6D r = 0.253, EuroQol r = 0.214). Disease-specific index scores (VascuQol) showed similar moderate correlation to treadmill walking distances (r = 0.584, P < .001) and weak but statistically significant correlation with resting and postexercise ABPI (r = 0.377, P < .001). All index scores showed strong and statistically significant (P< .001) correlation with patient-reported walking distance (SF-6D r = 0.604, EQ-5D r = 0.511, VascuQol r = 0.769). All domains of SF36 showed similar correlation with clinical indicators except general health. The strongest correlation was seen with treadmill walking distances in the domains of physical function (r = 0.538) and bodily pain (r = 0.524).\nAll generic and disease-specific QOL scores show statistically significant improvement with angioplasty and/or supervised exercise in patients with claudication due to femoropopliteal atherosclerosis. However, the degree of improvement seen in clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia is not reflected in these scores. These findings support the use of composite outcome measures with mandatory, independent assessment of QOL as an independent outcome measure in intervention studies in these patients.",

Seven trials were found. Survival data were combined to yield the pooled cumulative primary patency. We estimated the log hazard ratio (HR) for each 1-month interval and then combined the HRs in a stratified way across intervals to obtain an overall log HR for each trial. Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic HRs in fixed-effects and random-effects models.\nThe pooled cumulative primary patency of Dacron and PTFE grafts was, respectively, 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56.4%-64.0%) and 53.8% (95% CI, 46.8%-60.9%) at 3 years, and 49.2% (95% CI, 45.6%-52.7%) and 38.4% (95% CI, 32.2%-44.6%) at 5 years.

    "abstract": "Whether novel biomarkers improve risk prediction of mortality beyond standard cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients, and whether any such prediction differs with length of follow-up, remains controversial. Our objective was to determine in patients with PAD whether novel biomarkers improve prediction of CVD mortality and total mortality.\nA cohort of 397 patients who were referred to a vascular lab had PAD diagnosed by noninvasive testing. Fifty-eight percent also had coronary or cerebrovascular disease at baseline. Predictors of total, CVD, and non-CVD mortality were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models, and the incremental value of predictors was evaluated with both the C-statistic and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index.\nTotal mortality was 11% at 2-year follow-up and 65% at an average of 6.6-year of follow-up (maximum, 11.4 years). At 2 years, hs-CRP was a strong and significant predictor of mortality, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.56 per standard deviation (P = .006). However, at full follow up, standard CVD risk markers were significant (age, gender, ankle-brachial index, other CVD, and hypertension), but hs-CRP no longer showed a significant relationship (HR 1.12; P = .11). None of the other biomarkers studied showed a significant independent association with mortality. Hs-CRP improved the C-statistic and the IDI beyond standard risk markers at 2 years, but not at full follow-up.\nhs-CRP was a strong predictor of short-term mortality in this cohort of PAD patients, while standard risk markers were better at predicting longer-term mortality.",

    "abstract": "Efficacy results of endovascular repair (rEVAR) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) compared with open surgery are based on several observational studies containing selection bias. The present study compared rEVAR with open surgery in EVAR-suitable patients with an rAAA who all underwent the same preoperative imaging protocol.\nOur policy is to perform a computed tomography angiography on all patients with a suspected rAAA. rEVAR was performed when the rEVAR-vascular surgeon was on call and the patient was suitable for EVAR. Afterwards, two experienced independent blinded experts assessed all computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans on EVAR-suitability. Only EVAR-suitable patients were included in the main analyses. Outcome parameters included mortality (intraoperative, 30-day, and 6-month), complications, reinterventions, and length of hospital stay.\nFrom April 2002 until March 2008, 132 consecutive patients with suspected rAAAs were presented. Preoperative CTA confirmed rAAA in 104 patients, of whom 25 underwent rEVAR, and 79 underwent open surgery. In retrospect, the 25 rEVAR patients and 33 patients in the open group were judged EVAR-suitable by the experts. At baseline, there was an equal distribution of physiologic and anatomic characteristics as well as comorbidity. In EVAR-suitable patients, the intraoperative, 30-day, and 6-month mortality was 4.0% (1 of 25), 20.0% (5 of 25), and 28.0% (7 of 25) after rEVAR compared with 6.1% (2 of 33; P >.99), 45.5% (15 of 33; P = .04), and 54.5% (18 of 33; P = .04) after open surgery, respectively. Median length of hospital stay was 9.5 days (interquartile range, 5.0-20.5) after rEVAR and 17.0 days (interquartile range, 9.5-28.0) after open surgery (P = .03).\nIn EVAR-suitable patients, an absolute perioperative mortality reduction of 25.5% of rEVAR over open surgery was found, which was still present at 6 months of follow-up. These data suggest that rEVAR is a superior treatment option for EVAR-suitable patients with an rAAA compared with an open surgery.",

    "abstract": "Selective tibial revascularization refers to the practice of vessel repair vs ligation or observation based on factors observed at the time of injury. Although commonly employed, the effectiveness of this strategy and its impact on sustained limb salvage is unknown. The objective of this study is to define the factors most relevant in selective tibial artery revascularization and to characterize limb salvage following tibial-level vascular injury.\nThe cohort of active-duty military patients undergoing infrapopliteal artery repair comprises the tibial Bypass group. A similarly injured cohort of patients that did not undergo operative vascular intervention (No Bypass group) was identified. All tibial vessel injuries were documented by angiography. Data were compiled via medical records and patient interview. The primary outcome measure was failure of limb salvage. Multivariate regression was performed to identify factors associated with revascularization and to describe factors associated with amputation.\nBetween March 2003 and September 2008, 135 of 1332 patients with battle-related vascular injuries had documented tibial vessel disruption or occlusion. Of these, 104 were included for analysis. Twenty-one underwent autologous vein bypass at the time of injury (Bypass group), and the remaining 83 patients were managed without revascularization (No Bypass group). Mean follow-up (39 vs 41 months; P = .27), age (25 vs 27 years; P = .66), and mechanism of injury (88% vs 92% penetrating blast; P = .56) were similar, but the No Bypass group had higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS; 16.3 vs 11.7; P < .01). Injury characteristics, including Gustilo III classification (49% vs 43%; P = .81) and nerve injury (55% vs 53%; P = 1.0), were similar. Subjects were more likely to receive tibial bypass with an increasing number of tibial vessel occlusions and documented ischemia on initial exam. However, of the 23 in the No Bypass group with initially unobtainable Doppler signals, 17 (74%) regained pedal flow following resuscitation and limb stabilization. Amputation rates were similar (23% vs 19%; P = .79), but the prevalence of chronic limb pain was lower in the Bypass group (10% vs 30%, respectively; P = .08). Cox regression analysis of amputation-free survival demonstrated an association between mangled extremity severity score >5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; P = .01) and amputation.\nThis report provides outcomes data for wartime tibial vascular injury, which supports a selective approach to tibial artery revascularization. Clinical factors such as ISS and degree of ischemia guide which patients are best suited for tibial vascular repair, while injury-specific characteristics are associated with amputation regardless of revascularization status.",

We hypothesized that immediate TEVAR would reduce deaths from aortic rupture in patients with BAI.\nReview of 81 patients with BAI who arrived alive at a level I trauma center over a 10-year period.\nTwenty-three patients (28%) died within 4 hours of admission, including 12 who died of aortic rupture. Fifty-eight patients (72%) survived beyond 4 hours, and 8 (14%) ultimately died of associated injuries. Forty patients (69%) underwent aortic repair (30 open repair, 10 TEVAR), and 2 died of multisystem organ failure (MSOF). Comparing open repair to TEVAR, there were no differences in the length of hospital stay (33 +/- 27 vs 33 +/- 31 days), operative complications (77% vs 70%), or mortality (7% vs 0). Ten patients (17%) with minimal BAI were treated with beta blockade and observation; 4 have not healed their aortic injuries and 6 have been lost to follow-up. Thirty-three of the original 81 study patients (41%) ultimately died. Compared with the patients who died, the survivors were younger (37 vs 48 years; P = .01) and less likely to develop aortic rupture (0 vs 12; P < .001), require intubation in the field (27% vs 49%; P < .05), require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; 2% vs 30%; P < .001), or arrive hypotensive (17% vs 67%; P < .001). Survivors also had a lower mean injury severity score (34 +/- 12 vs 44 +/- 12; P < .001), fewer associated injuries (3 +/- 1 vs 4 +/- 3; P = .02), and a higher prevalence of aortic repair (79% vs 6%; P < .001). Multivariate analysis selected no attempt at aortic repair (odds ratio [OR], 90.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.6-1000) and hypotension on arrival (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.4-27) as the only independent variables associated with death.\nMortality remains high for patients with BAI, but most patients who arrive alive at the hospital do not experience aortic rupture. Rupture occurs within the first 4 hours of admission, often before the injury is recognized in time for salvage with immediate TEVAR. The decision to repair BAI was based on the extent of associated injuries and on the individual surgeon's judgment. Survival was not influenced by the timing of repair, but further studies are needed to compare the outcome of open repair vs TEVAR in patients who survive beyond 4 hours.",

    "abstract": "Operative mortality of patients undergoing symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (Sx-AAA) repair has been reported at 6% to 30% during the past 25 years. We used a multicenter regional database to describe the contemporary outcomes of patients undergoing repair of Sx-AAA.\nAll patients undergoing infrarenal AAA repair in 11 hospitals comprising the Vascular Study Group of Northern New England (VSGNNE) between 2003 and 2009 were studied. Sx-AAA was prospectively defined as an AAA accompanied by abdominal or back pain or tenderness, but without rupture. The primary study end point was in-hospital mortality. Secondary end points included in-hospital postoperative major adverse events (MAE) and late survival. These outcomes were compared between symptomatic patients and contemporary VSGNNE cohorts of elective (E-AAA) and ruptured AAAs (R-AAAs) treated within the same study period.\nDuring the study period, 2386 AAA repairs were performed, comprising 1959 (82%) E-AAAs, 156 (7%) Sx-AAAs, and 271 (11%) R-AAAs. Repair was endovascular in 945 (48%) E-AAAs, 60 (38%) Sx-AAAs, and 33 (12%) R-AAAs. Hospital mortality was 1.7% for E-AAA repair and 1.3% for Sx-AAA repair, but was 34.7% for R-AAA repair (P < .001). The MAE rates were 20%, 35%, and 63%, respectively, for E-AAA, Sx-AAA, and R-AAA repairs (P < .001). The mean Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) for Sx-AAA patients who survived was 79 +/- 12. Those who died had an average score of 92 +/- 7, and 83% of all Sx-AAA and R-AAA patients who died had a GAS >85. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that at 1 and 4 years, Sx-AAA repair was associated with intermediate survival (83% and 68%) compared with E-AAA repair (89% and 73%) and R-AAA repair (49% and 35%; P < .001).\nThe operative mortality of patients with Sx-AAA in contemporary practice appears better than that previously reported in the literature. Despite low operative mortality, MAE and late survival are intermediate compared with E-AAA and R-AAA repair. Review of previous series shows a trend for lower operative mortality after Sx-AAA repair in more recent series, which likely reflects improved perioperative care and more use of endovascular aneurysm repair.",

Despite low operative mortality, MAE and late survival are intermediate compared with E-AAA and R-AAA repair. Review of previous series shows a trend for lower operative mortality after Sx-AAA repair in more recent series, which likely reflects improved perioperative care and more use of endovascular aneurysm repair.",

Repair was endovascular in 945 (48%) E-AAAs, 60 (38%) Sx-AAAs, and 33 (12%) R-AAAs. Hospital mortality was 1.7% for E-AAA repair and 1.3% for Sx-AAA repair, but was 34.7% for R-AAA repair (P < .001). The MAE rates were 20%, 35%, and 63%, respectively, for E-AAA, Sx-AAA, and R-AAA repairs (P < .001). The mean Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) for Sx-AAA patients who survived was 79 +/- 12. Those who died had an average score of 92 +/- 7, and 83% of all Sx-AAA and R-AAA patients who died had a GAS >85. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that at 1 and 4 years, Sx-AAA repair was associated with intermediate survival (83% and 68%) compared with E-AAA repair (89% and 73%) and R-AAA repair (49% and 35%; P < .001).",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, endovascular repair (EV) has replaced open surgical repair (OSR) as the preferred method of treatment of blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs) at many trauma centers. This has resulted in reductions in mortality, length of stay, and major complications, including paraplegia, with the added expense of the initial endograft, subsequent surveillance, and reinterventions. The purpose of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation comparing these two methods of repair.\nWe performed an economic comparison of EV and OSR for the treatment of BTAI using a decision tree analysis with transition points derived from our institution's experience and through a review of the literature. Over a 15-year period (1991-2006), 28 patients with BTAI were treated at our center (15 EV, 13 OSR). Costs were obtained from our hospital's case costing center, the Ontario Case Costing Initiative, Ontario's Drug Benefit Formulary, and Ontario's Schedule of Benefits for physician costs. Our center's results were then combined with those from the literature to arrive at an economic model.\nThese combined results revealed that EV, when compared to OSR, resulted in decreased early mortality (7.2% vs 22.5%), decreased composite outcome of mortality and paraplegia (7.7% vs 27.6%) and decreased composite outcome of mortality and major complication (42.5% vs 69.8%). Patients undergoing EV also had shorter intensive care unit stays (12.2 vs 15.3 days), total hospital length of stays (22.5 vs 28.6 days), and ventilator days (8.0 vs 9.2 days). Additionally, patients undergoing EV had decreased total 1-year costs compared with OSR ($70,442 vs $72,833).\nEV repair of BTAIs offers a survival advantage as well as a reduction in major morbidity, including paraplegia, compared with OSR, and results in a reduction in costs at 1 year. As a result, from the cost-effectiveness point of view, EV is the DOMINANT therapy over OSR for these injuries.",

    "abstract": "Small-diameter veins are often a limiting factor for the successful creation of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). This study evaluated the use of intraoperative primary balloon angioplasty (PBA) as a technique to upgrade small-diameter veins during AVF creation. Sequential balloon angioplasty maturation (BAM) was evaluated as a technique to salvage failed fistulas, expedite maturation, and improve the patency of AVFs after PBA.\nSixty-two PBAs were performed in 55 patients with an intent-to-treat using an all-autologous policy. PBAs of veins were performed just before AVF creation using 2.5- to 4-mm angioplasty balloons (1- to 1.5-mm larger than the nominal vein diameter). PBAs were performed through the spatulated end of the vein for a length of up to 8 cm using hydrophilic guidewires and hand inflations without fluoroscopy. BAM was performed in 53 of the 62 PBAs at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the PBA. Successful outcome was determined as the functional ability to use the fistula for hemodialysis without surgical revision.\nOf the 62 PBAs, 53 (85.4%), comprising 47 of the original AVFs and 6 new site AVFs created at other sites, remained patent and subsequently underwent BAM with a resulting functional AVF. Fifteen of the 47 original AVFs: 14 due to occlusion; one AVF with a steal was ligated. Seven of the 14 fistulas that occluded were salvaged using recanalization techniques during sequential BAMs. Two of the seven fistulas that were not salvaged required AVGs (3%), and five patients underwent redo AVFs using alternative veins. These five cases were also performed using PBAs and BAMs technique. One patient with a functioning fistula underwent intentional ligation for steal syndrome and also underwent an alternative site AVF, PBA, and BAM. At 3 months, 53 AVFs were functional and successfully used for dialysis. Overall, a working AVF was obtained at the initial site in 47 of 55 patients (85.4%), and 53 (96.3%) received working AVFs that were functioning for dialysis access.\nSmall or suboptimal veins can undergo PBA and then be matured to create functioning AVFs <or=2 months. Overall, >90% autogenous AVF rates can be achieved using PBA and BAM. BAM can be successfully used to mature AVFs created from small veins and salvage thrombosed AVFs in many cases. The use of these techniques may decrease the number of patients requiring AVGs and indwelling catheters.",

    "abstract": "The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial is the only randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date comparing open surgical bypass with endovascular therapy for severe limb ischemia (SLI). In their initial 2005 publication, the BASIL investigators reported that the main clinical outcomes (overall survival and amputation-free survival) were no different at 2 years after randomization to angioplasty-first or bypass-first revascularization strategies. However, beyond 2 years there appeared to be a benefit for open bypass surgery, providing impetus for an extension study. The final analysis of the long-term outcomes from BASIL is now presented in a set of articles that are reviewed in this commentary. The benefit of initial randomization to open surgery for patients surviving > or =2 years (70% of the BASIL cohort) was confirmed. When outcomes were analyzed by treatment received, patients who had received prosthetic bypass grafts (25% of the surgical arm) fared much more poorly than those treated with a vein bypass. Patients who underwent surgical bypass after an initial failed angioplasty also fared significantly worse than those who were treated initially with bypass surgery. Health-related quality of life measures and costs were not significantly different overall. There are many controversies surrounding the BASIL trial and its interpretation, which are reviewed herein. These include the choice of study population, end points examined, and the nature of procedures performed. The BASIL trial confirms the primacy of open surgical bypass with vein for most patients with SLI and raises questions about the sequelae of failed endovascular interventions. Further multicenter trials are needed to address the large gap in evidence for treatment selection in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "An intention-to-treat analysis of the Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial showed that in patients with severe lower limb ischemia (SLI) due to infrainguinal disease who survived for 2 years after intervention, initial randomization to a bypass surgery (BSX)-first vs balloon angioplasty (BAP)-first revascularization strategy was associated with improvements in subsequent overall survival (OS) and amputation-free survival (AFS) of about 7 and 6 months, respectively. This study explored the value of baseline factors to estimate the likelihood of survival to 2 years for the trial cohort (Cox model) and for individual BASIL trial patients (Weibull model) as an aid to clinical decision making.\nOf 452 patients presenting to 27 United Kingdom hospitals, 228 were randomly assigned to a BSX-first and 224 to a BAP-first revascularization strategy. Patients were monitored for at least 3 years. Baseline factors affecting the survival of the entire cohort were examined with a multivariate Cox model. The chances of survival at 1 and 2 years for patients with given baseline characteristics were estimated with a Weibull parametric model.\nAt the end of follow-up, 172 patients (38%) were alive without major limb amputation of the trial leg, and 202 (45%) were alive. Baseline factors that were significant in the Cox model were BASIL randomization stratification group, below knee Bollinger angiogram score, body mass index, age, diabetes, creatinine level, and smoking status. Using these factors to define five equally sized groups, we identified patients with 2-year survival rates of 50% to 90%. The factors that contributed to the Weibull predictive model were age, presence of tissue loss, serum creatinine, number of ankle pressure measurements detectable, maximum ankle pressure measured, a history of myocardial infarction or angina, a history of stroke or transient ischemia attack, below knee Bollinger angiogram score, body mass index, and smoking status.\nPatients in the BASIL trial were at high risk of amputation and death regardless of revascularization strategy. However, baseline factors can be used to stratify those risks. Furthermore, within a parametric Weibull model, certain of these factors can be used to help predict outcomes for individuals. It may thus be possible to define the clinical and anatomic (angiographic) characteristics of SLI patients who are likely-and not likely-to live for >2 years after intervention. Used appropriately in the context of the BASIL trial outcomes, this may aid clinical decision making regarding a BSX- or BAP-first revascularization strategy in SLI patients like those randomized in BASIL.",

Using these factors to define five equally sized groups, we identified patients with 2-year survival rates of 50% to 90%. The factors that contributed to the Weibull predictive model were age, presence of tissue loss, serum creatinine, number of ankle pressure measurements detectable, maximum ankle pressure measured, a history of myocardial infarction or angina, a history of stroke or transient ischemia attack, below knee Bollinger angiogram score, body mass index, and smoking status.",

We now compare the effect on hospital costs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the BSX-first and BAP-first revascularization strategies using a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis.\nWe measured HRQOL using the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire (VascuQol), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and the EuroQol (EQ-5D) health outcome measure up to 3 years from randomization. Hospital use was measured and valued using United Kingdom National Health Service hospital costs over 3 years. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Uncertainty was assessed using nonparametric bootstrapping of incremental costs and incremental effects.\nNo significant differences in HRQOL emerged when the two treatment strategies were compared. During the first year from randomization, the mean cost of inpatient hospital treatment in patients allocated to BSX ($34,378) was estimated to be about $8469 (95% confidence interval, $2,417-$14,522) greater than that of patients allocated to BAP ($25,909). Owing to increased costs subsequently incurred by the BAP patients, this difference decreased at the end of follow-up to $5521 ($45,322 for BSX vs $39,801 for BAP) and was no longer significant. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a BSX-first strategy was $184,492 per QALY gained. The probability that BSX was more cost-effective than BAP was relatively low given the similar distributions in HRQOL, survival, and hospital costs.\nAdopting a BSX-first strategy for patients with severe limb ischemia does result in a modest increase in hospital costs, with a small positive but insignificant gain in disease-specific and generic HRQOL. However, the real-world choice between BSX-first and BAP-first revascularization strategies for severe limb ischemia due to infrainguinal disease cannot depend on costs alone and will require a more comprehensive consideration of individual patient preferences conditioned by expectations of survival and other health outcomes.",

The aim of this report is to describe the angiographic severity and extent of infrainguinal arterial disease in the BASIL trial cohort so that the trial outcomes can be appropriately generalized to other patient cohorts with similar anatomic (angiographic) patterns of disease.\nPreintervention angiograms were scored using the Bollinger method and the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II classification system by three consultant interventional radiologists and two consultant vascular surgeons unaware of the treatment received or patient outcomes.\nAs was to be expected from the randomization process, patients in the two trial arms were well matched in terms of angiographic severity and extent of disease as documented by Bollinger and TASC II. In patients with the least overall disease, it tended to be concentrated in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries, which were the commonest sites of disease overall. The below knee arteries became increasingly involved as the overall severity of disease increased, but the disease in the above knee arteries did not tend to worsen. The posterior tibial artery was the most diseased crural artery, whereas the peroneal appeared relatively spared. There was less interobserver disagreement with the Bollinger method than with the TASC II classification system, which also appears inherently less sensitive to clinically important differences in infrapopliteal disease among patients with severe leg ischemia.\nAnatomic (angiographic) disease description in patients with severe leg ischemia requires a reproducible scoring system that is sensitive to differences in crural artery disease. The Bollinger system appears well suited for this purpose, but the TASC II classification system less so. We hope this detailed analysis will facilitate appropriate generalization of the BASIL trial data to other groups of patients affected by similar anatomic (angiographic) patterns of disease.",

    "abstract": "An intention-to-treat analysis of randomized Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial data showed that initial randomization to a bypass surgery (BSX)-first strategy was associated with improvements in subsequent overall survival (OS) and amputation-free survival (AFS) of about 7 and 6 months, respectively. We describe the nature and timing of first, crossover, and reinterventions and examine AFS and OS by first treatment received. We also compare vein with prosthetic BSX and transluminal with subintimal balloon angioplasty (BAP) and examine outcomes from BSX after failed BAP.\nWe randomly assigned 452 patients with SLI due to infrainguinal disease in 27 United Kingdom hospitals to a BSX first (n = 228) or a BAP first (n = 224) revascularization strategy. All patients have been monitored for 3 years and more than half for >5 years. We prospectively collected data on every procedure, major amputation, and death.\nPatients randomized to BAP were more likely to have their assigned treatment first (94% vs 85%, P = .01, chi(2)test). BAP had a higher immediate technical failure rate of 20% vs 2.6% (P = .01, chi(2)test). By 12 weeks after randomization 9 BAP (4%) vs 23 BSX (10%) patients had not undergone revascularization; 3 BAP (1.3%) vs 13 BSX (5.8%) had undergone the opposite treatment first; and 35 BAP (15.6%) and 2 (0.9%) BSX had received the assigned treatment and then undergone the opposite treatment. BSX distal anastomoses were divided approximately equally between the above and below knee popliteal and crural arteries; most originated from the common femoral artery. About 25% of the grafts were prosthetic and >90% of vein BSX used ipsilateral great saphenous vein. Most (80%) BAP patients underwent treatment of the SFA alone (38%) or combined with the popliteal artery (42%) and crural arteries (20%). Outcome of vein BSX was better for AFS (P = 0.003) but not OS (P = 0.38, log-rank tests) than prosthetic BSX. There were no differences in outcome between approximately equal numbers of transluminal and subintimal BAP. AFS (P = 0.006) but not OS (P = 0.06, log rank test) survival was significantly worse after BSX after failed BAP than after BSX as a first revascularization attempt.\nBAP was associated with a significantly higher early failure rate than BSX. Most BAP patients ultimately required surgery. BSX outcomes after failed BAP are significantly worse than for BSX performed as a first revascularization attempt. BSX with vein offers the best long term AFS and OS and, overall, BAP appears superior to prosthetic BSX.",

We have monitored patients for a further 2.5 years and now report a final intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of amputation-free survival (AFS) and overall survival (OS).\nOf 452 enrolled patients in 27 United Kingdom hospitals, 228 were randomized to a BSX-first and 224 to a BAP-first revascularization strategy. All patients were monitored for 3 years and more than half for >5 years.\nAt the end of follow-up, 250 patients were dead (56%), 168 (38%) were alive without amputation, and 30 (7%) were alive with amputation. Four were lost to follow-up. AFS and OS did not differ between randomized treatments during the follow-up. For those patients surviving 2 years from randomization, however, BSX-first revascularization was associated with a reduced hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent AFS of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.07; P = .108) and for subsequent OS of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.50-0.75; P = .009) in an adjusted, time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. For those patients who survived for 2 years after randomization, initial randomization to a BSX-first revascularization strategy was associated with an increase in subsequent restricted mean overall survival of 7.3 months (95% CI, 1.2-13.4 months, P = .02) and an increase in restricted mean AFS of 5.9 months (95% CI, 0.2-12.0 months, P = .06) during the subsequent mean follow-up of 3.1 years (range, 1-5.7 years).\nOverall, there was no significant difference in AFS or OS between the two strategies. However, for those patients who survived for at least 2 years after randomization, a BSX-first revascularization strategy was associated with a significant increase in subsequent OS and a trend towards improved AFS.",

In particular, to our knowledge no report has described stent graft implantation into the pulmonary arteries in patients with total cavopulmonary connection (Fontan operation). This rarity might be related to the inability of commercially available devices to conform to the complex vascular geometry in these patients. We report the successful application of a homemade stent graft, which had been designed according to a preliminary angiographic assessment, to simultaneously treat left pulmonary artery stenosis and residual shunt, without reoperative sternotomy, long after Fontan completion.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has become an additional treatment option for patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms and suitable aortic morphology. However, endoleaks are commonly encountered and represent a relevant risk for secondary treatment failure. In addition, impaired renal function or allergic reactions to intravascular iodine application might represent exclusion criteria for conventional infrarenal endovascular aortic repair using intraoperative angiography with iodine contrast media. Real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with a low mechanical index (MI) is a promising method recently introduced for follow up after endovascular infrarenal aortic repair.\nIn this study, intraoperative CEUS using SonoVue as ultrasound contrast agent was evaluated in 17 patients for localization of the proximal infrarenal landing zone, the distal iliac fixation area, and identification of endoleaks in patients suitable for endovascular aortic repair with an infrarenal aortic neck > or =10 mm and non-aneurysmal common iliac arteries. For comparison, 20 patients were treated by conventional EVAR using intraoperative fluoroscopy and iodine contrast media.\nIntraoperative application of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (iCEUS) for identification of the infrarenal landing zone and proximal stent graft release was achieved in 14 out of 17 patients (82.4%), as verified by intraoperative angiography or postinterventional imaging. Intraoperative CEUS-assisted visualization of the distal fixation area proximal to the level of the iliac bifurcation was achieved in 89.3% (25 out of 28 iliac arteries examined) in comparison to intraoperative angiography or postinterventional CEUS, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. Three selected patients having contraindications for iodine-based contrast media were treated by iCEUS-assisted EVAR without the use of any iodine contrast during fluoroscopy. Time for exposure to intraoperative radiation, volume of contrast medium used, and the number of intraoperative angiographies and postinterventional CT or MR angiographies were significantly reduced in the iCEUS-assisted EVAR group in comparison to conventional endovascular aortic treatment (P < .002 or less for all parameters). Intraoperative application of CEUS detected more endoleaks than conventional EVAR (8/17 vs 4/20; P = .08) treated by proximal stent graft extension in one symptomatic patient with a type Ia endoleak.\nIntraoperative CEUS-assisted EVAR in patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms represents a new option for intraoperative visualization of aortoiliac segments required as proximal or distal fixation zones and identification of endoleaks, especially in those patients with contraindications for usage of iodine-containing contrast agents, in association with a reduction of iodine contrast media used and radiation exposure during fluoroscopy.",

Our aim was to develop a model capable of predicting long-term survival based on preoperative characteristics.\nA prospective cohort study using Cox regression modeling. We aimed to associate preoperative characteristics with long-term mortality, and create a predictive nomogram, which was then externally validated on an independent cohort (697 patients) who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nWe pooled the results of 412 patients undergoing endovascular repair of infrarenal and juxtarenal aneurysm who were high risk (average Glasgow aneurysm scores of 72.8 [SD 10.4]). Despite anatomic differences, there were no statistically significant differences in perioperative or long-term outcomes between infrarenal and juxtarenal aneurysms (log rank test, P = .5). Data from this group (64% infrarenal aneurysms and 36% juxtarenal aneurysms) were randomly and evenly split into a model development and test group. Independent predictors of mortality included in the model are age, aneurysm diameter, history of peripheral artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or congestive heart failure, requirement for supplemental home oxygen, and use of salicylates. Internal validation reveals good calibration and discriminative ability (c-statistic 0.68 [95% confidence interval 0.65-0.71]). External validation confirms good calibration.\nIn the context of acceptable perioperative results, long-term mortality risk can be predicted in endovascular AAA repair and must be balanced against risk of rupture to determine which patients should be offered treatment.",

    "abstract": "Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy without muscle flap coverage is our primary approach for graft preservation in early, deep groin infections with and without exposed grafts; however, concerns exist regarding its safety. We report our experience in a consecutive series of patients with early groin infections managed without muscle flap closure.\nAll patients with early (<30 day), deep vascular groin infections without (Szilagyi II) or with (Szilagyi III) exposed vascular graft or suture line between January 2004 and December 2008 were reviewed. Graft preservation followed by local wound care with VAC was attempted in all with intact anastomoses, patent grafts, and absence of systemic sepsis. Szilagyi classification, microorganism cultured, duration of VAC use, time to healing, additional interventions, and follow-up data (limb salvage, survival) were analyzed.\nTwenty-two patients (26 groins, mean age 69.1 +/- 9.5 years [range, 44-86 years]) presented with deep groin infections 16 +/- 5 days (range, 7-28 days) after the index procedure (bypass-polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 11], autologous vein [n = 3], endarterectomy/patch [n = 6], extra-anatomic bypass [n = 5], percutaneous closure device [n = 1]). Grafts were exposed in 12 groins (Szilagyi III, nine with suture lines). VAC was started one to six days (median, three) after operative debridement. All had positive wound cultures and received culture-directed antibiotic therapy for 47 +/- 45 days (range, 14-180 days). Length of stay was significantly more in Szilagyi III, whereas mean VAC use and time-to-healing were similar. Mean follow-up was 33.4 +/- 19.5 months (range, 2-72 months). All wounds healed (mean, 49 +/- 21 days). Two treatment failures occurred in the Szilagyi III group (17%). One patient had bleeding from the anastomotic heel eight days after debridement, had graft removal/in situ replacement and one presented with reinfection on day 117 and had partial graft removal/extra-anatomic bypass. There was no perioperative mortality or limb loss, but six late unrelated mortalities and one amputation at 46 months unrelated to the groin infection.\nManagement of early, deep groin wound infections with debridement, antibiotics, and VAC treatment is safe and enables graft preservation in the majority of patients with minimal morbidity, no perioperative limb loss, or mortality.",

    "abstract": "The Vascular Registry (VR) on carotid procedures collects long-term outcomes on carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) patients. The purpose of this report is to describe in-hospital and 30-day CAS outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic carotid artery disease (CAD; atherosclerosis [ATH]) compared to recurrent carotid stenosis (RES) and radiation-induced stenosis (RAD).\nThe VR collects provider-reported data on CAS using a Web-based data management system. For this report, data were analyzed at the preprocedure, procedure, predischarge, and 30-day intervals.\nAs of November 20, 2008, there were 4017 patients with CAS with discharge data, of which 72% were due to ATH. A total of 2321 patients were available for 30-day outcomes analysis (1623 ATH, 529 restenosis, 119 radiation, 17 dissection, 3 trauma, and 30 other). Baseline demographics showed that ATH occurred in older patients (72-years-old), had the greatest history of coronary artery disease (CAD; 62%), myocardial infarction (MI; 24%), valvular heart disease (8%), arrhythmia (16%), congestive heart failure (CHF; 16%), diabetes mellitus (DM; 35%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 20%). RES had a higher degree of baseline stenosis (87.0 vs 85.8 ATH; P = .010), were less likely to be symptomatic (35.5% vs 46.3% ATH; P < .001), but had a greater history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and smoking. RAD was seen in younger patients (66.6 vs 71.7 ATH; P < .001), were more likely to be male (78.2% vs 60.9% ATH; P < .001), and had less comorbidities overall, with the exception of amaurosis fugax, smoking, and cancer. The only statistically significant difference in perioperative rates was in transient ischemic attack (TIA; 2.7% ATH vs 0.9% RES; P = .02). There were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital death/stroke/MI (ATH 5.4%, RES 3.8%, RAD 4.2%) or at 30 days (ATH 7.1%, RES 5.1%, RAD 5.0%). Even after adjusting for age, gender, symptomatology, CHF, and renal failure, the only statistically significant difference at 30 days was amaurosis fugax between ATH and RAD (odds ratio [OR] 0.13; P = .01).\nAlthough patients with ATH have statistically significant comorbidities, they did not have statistically significant increased rates of death/stroke/MI during hospitalization or within 30 days after discharge when compared to RES or RAD. The CAS event rates for ATH vs RES and RAD are similar, despite prior published reports. Symptomatic ATH have statistically significant higher rates of death/stroke/MI compared to asymptomatic cohort. Finally, consistent and accurate entry of long-term data beyond initial hospitalization is essential to fully assess CAS outcomes since a significant number of adverse events occur in the interval from hospital discharge to 30 days.",

    "abstract": "To report midterm results of infrainguinal bypasses performed with a heparin-bonded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft in patients presenting with critical limb ischemia.\nOver a 7-year period ending in 2008, 425 patients presenting with critical limb ischemia underwent infrainguinal revascularization using a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft in seven Italian vascular centers. Preoperative, intraoperative, and follow-up data were collected in a multicenter registry. Patients were predominantly male (79%) with a mean age of 73.5 years. Mean preoperative ankle brachial index (ABI) was 0.35 and 192 of the patients (45%) were diabetic. Intervention consisted of a femoral to below-knee bypass in 324 patients (76%), whereas the remaining 101 patients had a femoral to above-knee bypass. In patients with below-knee bypass, distal target vessels were the popliteal artery in 238 cases, the tibioperoneal trunk in 38 cases, and a tibial vessel in the remaining 48 cases (anterior tibial artery in 20 cases, posterior tibial artery in 23 cases, and peroneal artery in 5). Follow-up consisted of clinical and duplex scanning examinations within 3 months from the intervention and yearly thereafter. Early (<30 day) results were analyzed in terms of deaths, graft thromboses, and amputations with univariate and multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analysis. Follow-up results were evaluated in terms of primary and secondary graft patency, limb salvage, and survival rate with univariate and multivariate (Cox regression) analysis.\nThirteen perioperative deaths occurred (3.1%). Thirty-day primary graft patency was 92.5% and limb salvage was 95.8%. Follow-up was available in 98% of patients with a median duration of 25.5 months (SD, 17.6; range, 1-72). Cumulative estimated 36-month primary and secondary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates were 61%, 70%, 83%, and 83%, respectively. At univariate analysis, the factors associated with poorer limb salvage rates during follow-up were the presence of ischemic ulcers or gangrene (log-rank, 8.4; P = .004; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.5; odds ratio [OR], 2.1), the presence of only one patent tibial vessel (log-rank, 41.3; P < .001; 95% CI, 3.1-10.8, OR, 5.8), redo surgery (log-rank, 12.4; P < .001; 95% CI, 1.4-4; OR, 2.4) and the postoperative treatment with antiplatelet therapy in comparison to oral anticoagulants (log-rank, 5.1; P = .02; 95% CI, 1.0-3.4; OR, 1.8). At multivariate analysis redo surgery (P = .02; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1; OR, 1.8), poor runoff score (P < .001; 95% CI, 2.5-9.1; OR, 4.7) and preoperative clinical status (P = .02; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1; OR, 1.8) were independently associated with decreased limb salvage rates.\nThe use of a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft provides good early and midterm results, with low rates of late amputations. Primary and secondary patency made this graft an excellent alternative to autologous saphenous vein when it is absent, unsuitable, or of poor quality.",

    "abstract": "To review all published reports and investigate the clinical relevance and need for treatment of carotid stent fractures.\nElectronic and hand-searching of the published literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database.\nThirteen articles were published. There are 10 case reports and 3 clinical studies. There are 26 reports of fractured stents in the MAUDE database. Fifty-five cases of carotid stent fractures are reported in total. A total of 201 carotid stents were examined in the 3 studies, and the incidence of fractures was 8.9% (18/201). Fractured stents were 22 Xact, 20 Acculink, 6 Precise, 2 Exponent, 1 Nexstent, 1 Genesis, 1 Symbiot, and 2 nonspecified nitinol self-expandable stents. Twenty-seven of the treated carotid lesions were atherosclerotic, 3 restenoses after carotid endarterectomy, 2 postradiational, 1 pseudoaneurysm, and 22 lesions of unknown pathology. Calcification was reported in 15 of the 27 atherosclerotic lesions (55.5%). Time from implantation to fracture ranged from 0 days (fracture during implantation) to 37 months. In 55% of the cases, stent fracture was associated with restenosis. Six patients presented with symptoms. Treatment was reported for 32 patients: 14 patients underwent de novo stent placement, 2 balloon angioplasty, 2 carotid endarterectomy, 2 bypass graft (1 vein, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene), 1 anticoagulation, and 11 patients were followed up.\nCarotid stent fractures are mainly reported in self-expandable nitinol stents. Plaque calcification may be a risk factor for stent fractures. No difference was observed between open and closed-cell design. Stent fractures were often associated with restenosis and usually were asymptomatic. The actual incidence, clinical relevance, and optimal treatment remain to be clarified from larger prospective studies designed to investigate the issue.",

    "abstract": "The use of shunting in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is controversial. This randomized trial compared the results of routine (RS) vs selective shunting (SS) based on stump pressure (SP).\nTwo-hundred CEA patients under general anesthesia were randomized into RS (98 patients) or SS (102 patients), where shunting was used only if systolic SP (SSP) was <40 mm Hg. Clinical and demographic characteristics were comparable in both groups. Patients underwent immediate and 30-day postoperative duplex ultrasound follow-up. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.\nOf 102 SS patients, 29 (28%) received shunting. Indications for CEA were similar (42% symptomatic for RS; 47% for SS, P = .458). The mean internal carotid artery diameter was comparable (5.5 vs 5.5 mm, P = .685). Mean preoperative ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis was 76% and 38% for RS (P = .268) vs 78% and 40% for SS (P = .528). Mean preoperative ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis was 79% and 56% in the shunted (P = .634) vs 78% and 34% in the nonshunted subgroup of SS patients (P = .002). The mean SSP was 55.9 mm Hg in RS vs 56.2 for SS (P = .915). The mean SSP was 33 mm Hg in the shunted vs 65 in the nonshunted subgroup (P < .0001). Mean clamp time in the nonshunted subgroup of SS was 32 minutes. Mean shunt time was 35 minutes in RS and 33 in SS (P = .354). Mean operative time was 113 minutes for RS and 109 for SS (P = .252), and 111 minutes in shunted and 108 in the nonshunted subgroup (P = .586). Mean arteriotomy length was 4.4 cm for RS and 4.2 for SS (P = .213). Perioperative stroke rate was 0% for RS vs 2% for SS (one major and one minor stroke, both related to carotid thrombosis; P = .498). No patients died perioperatively. Combined perioperative transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke rates were 2% in RS vs 2.9% in SS (P > .99). The overall perioperative complication rates were 8.3% in RS (2 TIA, 3 hemorrhage, 1 myocardial infarction [MI], and 1 asymptomatic carotid thrombosis) vs 7.8% in SS (2 strokes, 1 TIA, 3 hemorrhage, 1 MI, and 1 congestive heart failure; P = .917).\nRS and SS were associated with a low stroke rate. Both methods are acceptable, and surgeons should select the method with which they are more comfortable.",

    "abstract": "International treatment guidelines now recognize the importance of thrombus removal to reduce postthrombotic morbidity when treating patients with extensive acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity.\nForty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).\nMean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance.\nPatients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons have increasingly become proficient in carotid artery stenting (CAS) as an alternative treatment modality for cervical carotid artery occlusive disease. We analyzed our early and late outcomes of CAS over the last 8 years.\nWe report a single-center retrospective review of 388 carotid bifurcation lesions treated with CAS using cerebral embolic protection from May 2001 to July 2009. Data analysis includes demographics, procedural records, duplex exams, arteriograms, and two-view plain radiographs over a mean follow-up time of 23.0 months (interquartile range, 10.9-35.4).\nAt the time of treatment, the mean age of the entire cohort (76% men and 24% women) is 71 years; 13% were >/=80 years of age, and 31% had a prior history of either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and/or external beam neck irradiation (XRT). The mean carotid stenosis is 80%, and asymptomatic lesions represent 69% of the group. Overall 30-day rates of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction are 0.5%, 1.8%, and 0.8%, respectively. The combined death/stroke rate at 30 days is 2.3%. The 30-day major/minor stroke rates for analyzed subgroups are statistically significant only for XRT/recurrent stenosis vs de novo lesions, 0% and 2.6% (P = .03), but not for asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients, 1.9% and 1.7% (P = .91) and age <80 vs >/=80, 2.0% and 1.8% (P = .52), respectively. At long-term, the freedom from all strokes at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months was 99.2%, 97.6%, 96.7%, and 96.7%, respectively. At late follow-up, the restenosis rate is 3.5%. Restenosis rates for recurrent stenosis/XRT vs de novo lesions are 2.7% and 3.4% (P = .39). Among the restenotic lesions were two associated type III stent fractures in de novo lesions, both of which were closed-cell stents. An additional two other type I fractures have been identified, yielding a stent fracture rate of 5.5%. The late death rate for the entire group is 16.8%, with one stent-related death secondary to ipsilateral stroke at 20 months (0.3% death rate).\nVascular surgeons performing CAS with embolic protection can achieve good early and late outcomes that are comparable to CEA benchmarks. Late stent failures (stroke, restenosis, and/or stent fatigue), while uncommon, are a recognized delayed problem.",

    "abstract": "Aortic Customize is a new concept for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair in which a non polymerized elastomer is injected to fill the aneurysm sac around a balloon catheter. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the extent of aneurysm wall stress reduction by the presence of a noncompliant elastomer cuff.\nA thin-walled latex aneurysm (inner radius sac 18 mm, inner radius neck 8 mm), equipped with 12 tantalum markers, was attached to an in vitro circulation model. Fluoroscopic roentgenographic stereo photogrammetric analysis (FRSA) was used to measure marker movement during six cardiac cycles. The radius of three circles drawn through the markers was measured before and after sac filling. Wall movement was measured at different systemic pressures. Wall stress was calculated from the measured radius (sigma = pr/2t).\nThe calculated wall stress was 7.5-15.6 N/cm(2) before sac filling and was diminished to 0.43-1.1 N/cm(2) after sac filling. Before sac filling, there was a clear increase (P < .001) in radius of the proximal (range, 7.9%-33.5%), middle (range, 3.3%-25.2%), and distal (range, 10.5%-184.3%) rings with increasing systemic pressure. After sac filling with the elastomer, there remained a small, significant (P < .001) increase in the radius of the circles (ranges: 6.8%-8.8%; 0.7%-1.1%; 5.3%-6.7%). The sac filling reduced the extent of radius increase. The treated aneurysm withstood systemic pressures up to 220/140 mm Hg without noticeable wall movement. After the sac filling, there was no pulsation visible in the aneurysm wall.\nFilling the aneurysm sac of a simplified in vitro latex model with a biocompatible elastomer leads to successful exclusion of the aneurysm sac from the circulation. Wall movement and calculated wall stress are diminished noticeably by the injection of biocompatible elastomer.",

Rupture or aneurysm-related death and overall mortality in the two groups were compared during a mean follow-up of 20 +/- 12 months.\nAmong patients randomized to treatment, 89% underwent aneurysm repair. Among patients randomized to surveillance, 31% underwent aneurysm repair during the course of the study. After a mean follow-up of 20 +/- 12 months (range, 0-41 months), 15 deaths had occurred in each group (4.1%). The unadjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for mortality after early endovascular repair was 1.01 (0.49-2.07, P = .98). Aneurysm rupture or aneurysm-related death occurred in two patients in each group (0.6%). The unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.99 (0.14-7.06, P = .99) for early endovascular repair.\nEarly treatment with endovascular repair and rigorous surveillance with selective aneurysm treatment as indicated both appear to be safe alternatives for patients with small AAAs, protecting the patient from rupture or aneurysm-related death for at least 3 years.",

    "abstract": "The goal was to compare the outcomes in patients with disabling claudication (DC) or critical limb ischemia (CLI) to determine if diabetics (DM) have poorer patency, limb salvage (LS), and survival rates than nondiabetic patients and if the diabetic regimen affects these outcomes.\nAll patients who presented with DC or CLI between June 2001 and September 2008 were included. Non-DM patients were compared with those with DM who are currently managed by diet only or oral medications (D-OM), oral medications plus insulin (OM+INS), or insulin alone (INS).\nOf the 746 patients (886 limbs), there were 406 patients (464 limbs) in non-DM, 96 patients (135 limbs) in D-OM, 98 patients (118 limbs) in OM+INS, and 146 patients (185 limbs) in INS groups. There were more patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, and renal insufficiency in the DM group than non-DM, with the INS group having the highest incidence of renal insufficiency/dialysis (46%/20%). Gangrene and foot sepsis were significantly more frequent in patients in OM+INS (45%/3%) and INS (50%/6%) than non-DM (15%/0.2%) and D-OM groups (25%/1%; P < .001). More patients in the INS group (14%) and OM+INS (9%) had primary amputation than non-DM (4%) and D-OM (4%; P < .01). Mean follow-up was 26.3 +/- 20.7 months. Overall survival following revascularization was similar in D-OM and non-DM and OM+INS and INS, the latter being significantly worse (P < .001). The LS rate in D-OM and non-DM was also identical, whereas OM-INS and INS had significantly worse LS, with OM-INS marginally better than INS (P = .094). Primary patency (PP) was worse in endovascular-treated patients on insulin than non-DM and D-OM patients (P < .001), whereas PP was similar between groups in open-treated patients. Multivariate analysis showed that coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indication for intervention, insulin use, nonambulatory status, and statin drug non-use were independently associated with decreased survival, whereas insulin use, presence of gangrene, need for infrapopliteal interventions, and nonambulatory status were independently associated with limb loss. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification of the treated lesions being C or D, infrapopliteal interventions, and indication of intervention (DC vs CLI) were independently associated with primary patency, whereas insulin use was not.\nDiabetic patients who present with limb ischemia can be subdivided into three distinct subgroups based on their diabetic regimen. The survival and LS rates of those controlled with diet or OM are nearly identical to nondiabetics, both of which are significantly better than OM+INS or INS. The PP rate in endovascular-treated patients is worse in patients who are on insulin. Being on insulin is independently associated with decreased survival and limb loss but not PP.",

    "abstract": "Even when promptly recognized and treated, aortoesophageal (AEF) and aortobronchial (ABF) fistulae are highly lethal conditions. Open surgical repair also carries a high risk of mortality and morbidity. Several alternative strategies have been recently reported in the literature including thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, relatively little is known about results of TEVAR for AEF and ABF due to their rarity and the lack of large surveys.\nA voluntary national survey was conducted among Italian universities and hospital centers with an endovascular program. Questionnaires were distributed by e-mail to participating centers and aimed to evaluate the results of endovascular repair of established AEF or ABF.\nSeventeen centers agreed to participate and provided data on their patients. Between 1998 and 2008, a total of 1138 patients were treated with TEVAR. In 25 patients (2.2%), the indication to treatment was an AEF and/or an ABF. In 10 of these cases (40%), an associated open surgical procedure was also performed. Thirty-day mortality rate of AEF/ABF endovascular repair was 28% (7 cases). No cases of paraplegia or stroke were observed. Mean follow-up was 22.6 months (range, 1-62). Actuarial survival at 2 years was 55%. Among the 18 initial survivors, five patients (28%) underwent reintervention due to late TEVAR failure.\nStent grafting for AEF and ABF represents a viable option in emergent and urgent settings. However, further esophageal or bronchial repair is necessary in most cases. Despite less invasive attempts, mortality associated with these conditions remains very high.",

    "abstract": "The choice between open surgery (OS) and transluminal carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS) for the treatment of primary carotid stenosis remains controversial. However, CAS is considered a valid option for selected cases, such as recurrent carotid stenosis (RCS). Tertiary RCS seems to be a concerning issue after CAS but few large reports focused on the durability of CAS and OS. We report our early and long-term results with OS for RCS.\nFrom 1989 to 2006, perioperative data regarding 4245 consecutive surgical carotid reconstructions was prospectively collected. Patients whose indication was RCS were subjected to further analysis. Indications for surgery were symptomatic RCS >50% or asymptomatic RCS >80%. Freedom from neurologic event was defined as the absence of any ipsilateral symptom at any time after the procedure. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate freedom from reintervention, freedom from restenosis >50% and occlusion, freedom from neurologic event and survival.\nA total of 119 patients (2.8%) with RCS underwent OS. The average time from the primary OS was 59.4 +/- 54.5 months (range, 2-204). Forty-nine patients (41%) were symptomatic. In 103 patients (87%), the technique did not differ from a primary approach. Postoperative (<30 days) combined stroke and death rate was 3.3%. Cranial nerve injury occurred in 5 cases (4.2%). With a mean follow-up of 53 +/- 48 months (range, 1-204), 3 patients had an ipsilateral stroke (including one hemorrhagic stroke) and 7 were diagnosed with a tertiary RCS >50%. At 5 years, Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from reintervention, freedom from restenosis and occlusion, freedom from neurologic event, and survival were 99%, 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively.\nOS for RCS is not a high-risk procedure and provides excellent long-term results, with low rates of tertiary RCS and reinterventions. The comparison between OS and CAS in this indication suffers from the absence of standardized follow-up paradigms after primary OS and the lack of prospective randomized trial comparing the two techniques. Despite these limitations in the available data, we conclude that OS should remain the first line therapy when treatment of RCS is indicated.",

Forty patients had additional cardiovascular disorders and concomitant procedures performed including aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus, ascending aorta repair, and the Bentall procedure. The other three patients had complex coarctation of the aorta, including a long-segment coarctation in two cases, and descending aortic aneurysm in one.\nTwo patients died perioperatively: one due to air embolism during the cardiopulmonary bypass; one due to septic shock. There were no late deaths. Complications included laparotomy for mechanical ileus in one and re-exploration for bleeding in one case. There were no strokes or paraplegia and no grafted-related complication during follow-up period. Systolic blood pressure dropped from 160 +/- 27 mm Hg before surgery to 114 +/- 16 mm Hg postoperatively. Only two patients with mild hypertension postoperatively needed oral medicine.\nExtra-anatomic aortic bypass via median sternotomy or median sternotomy-laparotomy can be performed with low morbidity and mortality. It is a preferable single-stage approach for patients with concomitant complex coarctation and cardiovascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is associated with a more aggressive form of atherosclerosis. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix protein, is an acute-phase reactant that induces vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) migration and proliferation in areas of vascular injury and is also up-regulated in VSMCs exposed to hyperglycemia. This study tested the hypothesis that hyperglycemia amplifies the expression of genes induced by TSP-1 in VSMCs.\nHuman aortic VSMCs were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics. Cells were used between passages three and five. VSMCs were preincubated in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS with 5 mM glucose (normoglycemia), 25 mM glucose (hyperglycemia), 25 mM mannose (osmotic control), TSP-1 (20 microg/mL), 25 mM glucose + TSP-1 (20 microg/mL), or 25 mM mannose + TSP-1 (20 microg/mL). Total RNA was extracted. Microarray analysis was performed and analyzed by analysis of variance. P < .05 was considered significant. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) was used to confirm selected up-regulated genes.\nMicroarray analysis revealed: (1) hyperglycemia altered 30 genes; (2) TSP-1 altered 212 genes, of which 8 were altered similarly to VSMCs exposed to 25 mM glucose; (3) TSP-1 up-regulated 10 genes associated with atherosclerosis and 4 others with diabetic vascular disease; (4) hyperglycemia combined with TSP-1 altered expression of 2822 genes. The three genes most up-regulated by TSP-1 in a normoglycemic environment were uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) dehydrogenase (UGDH, 127%), transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFbeta2, 116%), and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2, 113%). Further, TSP-1 altered the expression of genes in 13 canonical pathways; however, when combined with hyperglycemia, 53 canonical pathways were affected.\nQuantitative rtPCR confirmed that genes in several of these pathways for TSP-1 and hyperglycemia combined with TSP-1 were up-regulated. These findings suggest that TSP-1 may be germane to the progression of atherosclerosis and may have a large effect with concurrent hyperglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Various types of device-specific adverse events can occur during deployment of thoracic stent grafts due to the high flow rate and severe aortic angulation that is often encountered in the thoracic aorta. This study assessed the incidence, etiology, and overall effect of misaligned deployment of the Talent Thoracic Stent Graft (TSG) System. Techniques to predict and avoid this complication are discussed.\nData collection included pivotal-trial follow-up, direct surveys of centers inside and outside the United States and principal investigators, a targeted literature search, and review of complaint files. Misaligned deployment was considered to occur when the proximal covered or uncovered stent apices of a thoracic stent graft folded back on itself and remained nonparallel to the wall of the aorta after deployment had been completed.\nOf about 20,305 deployments to date of the Talent TSG, 24 misaligned deployments were identified for an incidence of 0.1%. Nineteen (79%) events occurred during treatment of degenerative aneurysms or penetrating ulcers, four (17%) during treatment of dissections, and the underlying pathology could not be determined for one patient. The misalignment was noted at the proximal end of the stent graft in 15 patients (63%), and the other 9 events (37%) occurred at the graft overlap junction. Two events were treated intraoperatively, with a second overlapping device placed in one patient and a snare used to reposition the proximal stent in another. Adverse clinical events occurred in three patients and included a persistent type I endoleak, continued false lumen perfusion in a patient with dissection, and delayed retrograde type A dissection in a patient undergoing total arch repair. No intraoperative contrast extravasation or computed tomography evidence of perforation was noted. There were no perioperative deaths or cerebrovascular events, with one report of paraplegia among the 24 patients in this series.\nMisaligned deployment is an unusual phenomenon that tends to occur in the context of certain well-defined anatomic conditions in the thoracic aorta. To date, most of these events have not led to significant adverse sequelae. However, careful patient selection, periprocedural imaging, and case planning can help to identify anatomies in which misaligned opening is likely to occur, allowing physicians to avoid this complication.",

The same protocol was applied postoperatively, and five different levels of satisfaction were obtained. The same parameters were evaluated for both the palmar and the axillary hyperhidrosis subgroups.\nThe patients with very poor QOL had much better results in terms of improvement in QOL than did those with poor QOL (P < .05).

Cognitive brain function was objectively measured by means of P300 auditory evoked potentials (peak latencies in milliseconds [ms]) before CEA, at discharge, and at 1 and 5 years. Values were compared with 25 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals.\nCognitive P300 evoked potentials were prolonged (ie, impaired) in patients before CEA compared with controls (vertex [Cz], 384 +/- 52 vs 357 +/- 16 ms, P = .020]. At 1 year, P300 evoked potentials were significantly shortened (ie, improved) in patients after CEA compared with baseline values [Cz, 371 +/- 38 vs 384 +/- 52 ms, P = .010]. Furthermore, no difference between patients after CEA and controls was observed [Cz, 371 +/- 38 vs 360 +/- 14 ms, P = .21]. This effect was sustained at 5 years, and P300 evoked potentials continued to be significantly shortened (ie, improved) in patients after CEA compared with baseline values [Cz, 367 +/- 39 vs 384 +/- 52 ms, P = .040]. Continuing, no difference between patients after CEA and controls could be observed [Cz, 367 +/- 39 vs 362 +/- 17 ms, P = .58]. These results could be confirmed in repeated measures analysis of variance for Cz (P = .025) and frontal (Fz) results (P = .018).\nCEA improves previously impaired cognitive brain function as shown by P300 measurements similar to normal cognitive brain function of age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. This beneficial effect is sustained up to 5 years after treatment.",

While solutions have been proposed to overcome the problem of a short proximal neck, no technique has been described that solves the problem of a short distal neck. We present the \"periscope technique,\" which allows extension of the distal landing zone and complete endovascular treatment of ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysms with short distal necks using devices already stocked in most centers performing EVAR procedures.",

    "abstract": "Although contrast venography is the standard imaging method for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging is a safe and effective option that allows for bedside filter placement and is especially advantageous for immobilized critically ill patients by limiting resource use, risk of transportation, and cost. This study reviewed the effectiveness of a prospectively implemented algorithm for IVUS-guided IVC filter placement in this high-risk population.\nCurrent evidence-based guidelines were used to create a clinical decision algorithm for IVUS-guided IVC filter placement in critically ill patients. After a defined lead-in phase to allow dissemination of techniques, the algorithm was prospectively implemented on January 1, 2008. Data were collected for 1 year using accepted reporting standards and a quality assurance review performed based on intent-to-treat at 6, 12, and 18 months.\nAs defined in the prospectively implemented algorithm, 109 patients met criteria for IVUS-directed bedside IVC filter placement. Technical feasibility was 98.1%. Only 2 patients had inadequate IVUS visualization for bedside filter placement and required subsequent placement in the endovascular suite. Technical success, defined as proper deployment in an infrarenal position, was achieved in 104 of the remaining 107 patients (97.2%). The filter was permanent in 21 (19.6%) and retrievable in 86 (80.3%). The single-puncture technique was used in 101 (94.4%), with additional dual access required in 6 (5.6%). Periprocedural complications were rare but included malpositioning requiring retrieval and repositioning in three patients, filter tilt >/=15 degrees in two, and arteriovenous fistula in one. The 30-day mortality rate for the bedside group was 5.5%, with no filter-related deaths.\nSuccessful placement of IVC filters using IVUS-guided imaging at the bedside in critically ill patients can be established through an evidence-based prospectively implemented algorithm, thereby limiting the need for transport in this high-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Isopropylamine NONOate (IPA/NO) is a nitroxyl (HNO) donor at physiologic pH. HNO is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, but little is known about its effect on neointimal hyperplasia. The aims of this study are to determine the effect of IPA/NO on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and to determine if IPA/NO inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in vivo.\nVSMC were harvested from the abdominal aortas of male Sprague Dawley rats, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased from ATCC. In vitro, cellular proliferation was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, cell migration was assessed using the scrape assay, and cell death was assessed using Guava personal cell analysis (PCA). Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. Protein expression was assessed using Western blot analysis. Phosphorylated proteins were assessed using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. In vivo, the carotid artery injury model was performed on male Sprague Dawley rats treated with (n = 12) or without (n = 6) periadventitial IPA/NO (10 mg). Arteries harvested at 2 weeks were assessed for morphometrics using ImageJ. Inflammation was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Endothelialization was assessed by Evans blue staining of carotid arteries harvested 7 days after balloon injury from rats treated with (n = 6) or without (n = 3) periadventitial IPA/NO (10 mg).\nIn vitro, 1000 micromol/L IPA/NO inhibited both VSMC (38.7 +/- 4.5% inhibition vs control, P = .003) and endothelial cell proliferation (54.0 +/- 2.9% inhibition vs control, P < or = 0.001) without inducing cell death or inhibiting migration. In VSMC, this inhibition was associated with an S-phase cell cycle arrest and increased expression of cyclin A, cyclin D1, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. No change was noted in the phosphorylation status of cdk2, cdk4, or cdk6 by IPA/NO. In rodents subjected to the carotid artery balloon injury model, IPA/NO caused significant reductions in neointimal area (298 +/- 20 vs 422 +/- 30, P < or = .001) and medial area (311 +/- 14 vs 449 +/- 16, P < or = .001) compared with injury alone, and reduced macrophage infiltration to 1.7 +/- 0.8 from 16.1 +/- 3.5 cells per high power field (P < or = .001). IPA/NO also prevented re-endothelialization compared with injury alone (55.9 +/- 0.5% nonendothelialized vs 21 +/- 4.4%, respectively, P = .001). Lastly, a 50% mortality rate was observed in the IPA/NO-treated groups.\nIn summary, while IPA/NO modestly inhibited neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting VSMC proliferation and macrophage infiltration, it also inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and induced significant mortality in our animal model. Since HNO is being investigated as a treatment for congestive heart failure, our results raise some concerns about the use of IPA/NO in the vasculature and suggest that further studies be conducted on the safety of HNO donors in the cardiovascular system.",

    "abstract": "This study characterized temporal changes in the infrarenal aortic aneurysm neck in patients with small, untreated abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nPatients with infrarenal AAA who had contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans separated by >6 months were identified and their images reviewed. Infrarenal neck diameter and length were measured along with aneurysm diameter. Comparisons between the interval CT scans were made and analysis of factors affecting neck changes performed.\nSixty patients met inclusion criteria with an imaging interval of 3.8 years (median, 3.4 years; range, 0.75-9.6 years). During the interval, there was an increase in proximal and distal neck diameters of 1.1 mm (SD, 2.2) (0.28 mm/y) and 1.0 mm (SD, 3.0) (0.26 mm/y), respectively. During the same interval, the neck length decreased by 4 mm (SD, 11) (1 mm/y). A neck length of <15 mm was present in 10 patients (17%) at the initial imaging. Four of the remaining 50 patients experienced an interval decrease in neck length to <15 mm, all of whom had initial lengths of 15 to 20 mm. Medications had no association with changes in neck morphology; however, diabetes correlated with a slower rate of neck shortening (P = .001).\nThe natural history of the aneurysm neck is one of expansion and shortening that will not affect most patients under surveillance. Patients with marginal neck lengths (range, 15-20 mm) at the initial imaging are more likely to experience loss of neck length that may negatively affect endovascular suitability.",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of patients undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery (LEB) for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) will have cardiovascular or graft-related events. It has been previously demonstrated that systemic inflammation is associated with PAD and its clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that serum biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation would identify a subgroup at elevated risk for graft failure, limb loss, and mortality.\nThis was a prospective longitudinal study of patients (n = 225) undergoing LEB using autogenous vein. Baseline blood samples were obtained prior to surgery in the fasting state. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and the adipokines resistin and high-molecular weight adiponectin (HMWA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Median follow-up was 893 days. The major endpoints of primary patency (PP) and amputation-free survival (AFS) were examined using multivariable methods. Endpoints were screened against biomarkers and patient characteristics for univariate associations. Promising explanatory variables (P < .1) were included in multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.\nThe mean age of subjects was 67.6 years; 71.6% were male and 87.1% were Caucasian. One hundred thirty-three (59.1%) subjects underwent bypass for critical limb ischemia (CLI) and 73 (32.4%) had tissue loss. Patients with CLI and diabetes demonstrated elevated resistin and hsCRP levels. HMWA levels correlated with CLI and with a measure of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) but not with clinical diabetes. Baseline biomarkers were higher in those presenting with tissue loss and in patients with postoperative events (mortality, limb loss). After multivariable analysis (including CLI, diabetes, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], adiponectin, resistin, and CRP), resistin (hazard ratio [HR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.85; P = .025) and CRP (HR 2.39, 95% CI, 1.30-4.39; P = .005) were independently predictive of reduced AFS. However, only resistin maintained its significance when restricted to the diabetic cohort (HR 2.10, 95% CI, 1.10-3.99; P = .025). Higher levels of HMWA were found to be associated with primary graft patency (HR 0.73 for graft failure; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.97; P = .031) in a multivariable model adjusting for diabetes, CRP, African-American race, CLI, high-risk conduits, and redo bypass procedures.\nThese findings suggest that serum biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation may be predictive of clinical outcomes following LEB. Improving the systemic milieu of insulin resistance and inflammation in these high-risk patients may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The intent of endovascular therapy for symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is to preserve parenchyma and avoid renal-related morbidity. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of renal artery intervention on parenchymal preservation.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent endovascular intervention for ARAS and were followed by duplex ultrasound between 1990 and 2008. Renal volume (in cm(3)) was estimated in all patients as renal length (cm) x renal width (cm) x renal depth (cm) x 0.5. The normal renal volume was calculated as 2 x body weight (kg) in cm(3). Failure of preservation was considered to be a persistent 10% decrease in volume. Clinical benefit defined as freedom from renal-related morbidity (increase in persistent creatinine >20% of baseline, progression to hemodialysis, death from renal-related causes) was calculated.\nFive hundred ninety-two renal artery interventions were performed. One hundred eighty-six kidneys suffered parenchymal loss (>5%) with an actuarial parenchymal loss rate of 29% +/- 1% at five years respectively. There were no significant differences in age, gender, starting renal volume, or kidney size. However, patients with parenchymal loss had lower eGFR (45 +/- 24 vs 53 +/- 24 mL/min/1.73 m(2); Loss vs noLoss, P = .0002, Mean +/- SD) higher resistive index (0.75 +/- 0.9 vs 0.73 +/- 0.10; P = .0001) and worse nephrosclerosis grade (1.43 +/- 0.55 vs 1.30 +/- 0.49; P = .006) then those not suffering parenchymal loss. Parenchymal loss was associated with significantly worse five-year survival (26% +/- 4% vs 48% +/- 2%; Loss vs noLoss; P < .001) and freedom from renal-related morbidity (70% +/- 5% vs 82% +/- 2%; P < .05) with increased numbers progressing to dialysis (17% vs 7%; P < .006).\nWhile parenchymal preservation occurs in most patients, parenchymal loss occurs in 31% of patients and is associated with markers of impaired parenchymal perfusion (resistive index and nephrosclerosis grade) at the time of intervention. Pre-existing renal size or volumes were not predictive of parenchymal loss. Parenchymal loss is associated with a significant decrease in survival and a marked increased renal related morbidity and progression to hemodialysis.",

At 12 months of follow-up, a nonanastomotic false aneurysm of the vein graft occurred and was treated by interposition of prosthetic graft. Two months later, an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm between the two grafts was excluded by two stent grafts. Based on our experience and a review of the literature, we compared the outcomes of prosthetic and autologous vein reconstructions and discussed the role of carotid ligation and immunosuppressive treatment.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous closure is a common method to treat saphenous vein incompetence. Despite attempts to prevent it, some patients have extension of thrombus above the ideal site of closure immediately below the epigastric vein. We have developed a classification system for the level of saphenous vein closure to guide further therapy after endovenous treatment.\nA six-tier classification system was developed, based on thrombus proximity to the epigastric or femoral vein, and an algorithm for treatment, based on level of closure was applied to all patients.\nFive hundred consecutive patients underwent radio-frequency ablation of the saphenous vein; it was successfully closed in 498 (99.6%) patients. Thirteen patients (2.6%) experienced thrombus bulging into the femoral vein or adherent to its wall, which was treated with anticoagulation. All of these patients had thrombus retraction to the level of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) in an average of 16 days with concurrent anticoagulation. No femoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurred in the series. There was a significantly higher rate of proximal thrombus extension in those patients with a history of DVT and those with a great saphenous vein (GSV) diameter of >8 mm (P < .02).\nA classification system for saphenous endovenous closure which extends above the epigastric vein has been helpful in guiding management. A GSV diameter at the SFJ of >8 mm and a history of DVT results in significantly higher rates of proximal thrombus extension into the femoral vein. A short course of LMWH, until clot retracts back into the saphenous vein, is therapeutic. Management of the patients with thrombus flush with the femoral vein wall still needs to be defined, but the outcome from these patients is generally benign.",

This article reports the procedural details and clinical results of our series of neurosalvage techniques to manage thromboembolic events during carotid procedures.\nBetween March 2003 and December 2007, 342 patients (283 men, 72.1 +/- 8.9 years old, 121 symptomatic) underwent percutaneous stent deployment in 407 cervical internal carotid arteries in our institution. Visible distal embolization with flow occlusion caused neurologic complications in 10 patients (2.5%), and a structured and stepwise neurosalvage approach was attempted.\nGuidewire fragmentation and microcatheter injection of heparin and nitroglycerin were performed in all 10 patients as step 1. Intra-arterial thrombolysis was given in four patients and balloon angioplasty in five, as step 2. Intracranial stenting was done in one patient as the last step. Successful angiographic recanalization (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 2-3) occurred in 9 of 10 (90%). Residual neurologic sequel was observed in five, including three patients with hemorrhage complications (1 received emergent craniotomy). There was no neurologic mortality in this series.\nAcute embolic complication during carotid artery stenting can be managed by catheter-based neurosalvage with effective angiographic recanalization and marginal clinical success.",

    "abstract": "The presence of an endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) may predispose to sac expansion and potential sac rupture. The incidence of endoleak after AAA repair can be as high as 20% to 30%. We investigated whether warfarin anticoagulation was an independent risk factor for endoleak after EVAR for AAA.\nAll AAA patients who underwent elective EVAR were prospectively followed-up. Data for demographics, clinical comorbidities, outcomes, EVAR devices, and anticoagulation methods were recorded. All patients underwent routine follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) with 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric analysis was also completed.\nDuring a 7-year period, 127 consecutive patients with infrarenal AAAs who underwent EVAR were monitored for a mean of 2.14 years. The average age at the time of EVAR was 73.8 years. Warfarin therapy alone was administered to 24 patients, and anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy alone was administered to 103. During the study period, 38 (29.9%) endoleaks were documented. The overall endoleak rate was 13 of 24 in the warfarin group and 25 of 103 in the antiplatelet group (P = .004). CTA 3D volumetric aneurysm sac analysis showed an increase of 16.09% in the warfarin study group and a reduction of 9.71% in the antiplatelet group (P = .04).\nAnticoagulation with warfarin appears to be linked to an increased risk for the development of endoleak after EVAR, specifically type II. Volumetric analysis showed warfarin therapy also contributed to persistent aneurysm sac expansion. These data suggest that patients who require warfarin anticoagulation for other indications should be advised that they might be at an increased risk for the development of endoleaks, subsequent secondary interventions, persistent sac expansion, and possible delayed sac rupture.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) has traditionally predicted poor outcomes after lower extremity revascularization for peripheral vascular disease (PVD). This study assessed the influence of DM on long-term outcomes of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, with or without stenting (PTA/stent), in patients with PVD.\nFrom January 2002 to December 2007, 920 patients underwent 1075 PTA/stent procedures. Patients were stratified into DM and non-DM cohorts. Study end points included primary patency (PP), assisted patency (AP), limb salvage, and survival and were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.\nThere were 533 DM and 542 non-DM limbs. Median follow-up was 34 months. Overall, the 5-year actuarial PP was 42% +/- 2.4%, AP was 81% +/- 2.0%, limb salvage was 89% +/- 1.6%, and survival was 60% +/- 2.4%. On univariate analysis, DM vs non-DM was associated with inferior 5-year PP (37% +/- 3.4% vs 46% +/- 3.3%; P = .009), limb salvage (84% +/- 2.6% vs 93% +/- 1.8%, P < .0001), and survival (52% +/- 3.5% vs 68% +/- 3.1%, P = .0001). AP did not differ between DM and non-DM patients (P = .18). In the entire cohort, DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.54; P = .04), single-vessel peroneal runoff (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.08; P = .003), and dialysis (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.33; P = .02) were associated with decreased PP on multivariate analysis. The only variables on multivariate analysis to predict limb loss and death were critical limb ischemia (HR, 9.09; 95% CI, 4.17-20.00; P < . 0001; HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.01-4.44; P < .0001, respectively) and dialysis (HR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.39-5.00; P = .003; HR, 4.24; 95% CI 2.80-6.45; P < .0001, respectively).\nDM is an independent predictor of decreased long-term primary patency after PTA/stent. Although acceptable assisted patency rates can be achieved with close surveillance and reintervention, long-term limb salvage remains inferior in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic patients due to a more severe clinical presentation and poor runoff.",

We developed a new venous anastomotic graft design that combines a flow diffuser and flow division, thereby creating a double-channel graft (Bi-Flow graft) and tested it in vitro.\nIn vitro experiments have been performed using silastic models of six different anastomotic configurations (straight end-to-side, cuffed Venaflo-type, large and small diffuser, and large and small Bi-Flow) inserted into a pulsatile-flow circuit. The silastic models were created using a computerized numerical control design approach, varying only the venous anastomoses. Velocity fields and shear stresses were obtained using particle image velocimetry, and volumetric flow rates through the models were measured using an ultrasound flowmeter.\nThe hooded graft configurations showed significantly lower shear forces than did the end-to-side anastomosis. The shear stresses in the straight end-to-side graft were as high as arterial wall stresses. Large separation areas were present in the hooded grafts, except for the small Bi-Flow graft, which showed only isolated separation zones near the baffle used to divide the flow. The double-channel grafts exhibited a parabolic flow profile consisting of laminar flow in the double-outflow portion of the model's laminar flow pattern through the venous anastomosis. A marked flow separation was present in the large Bi-Flow model. Volumetric flow measurements revealed an average flow increase of 21% through the small Bi-Flow graft, which was attributed to the optimization of flow dynamics and pattern within the venous anastomosis of the double-channel graft.\nThe new arteriovenous Bi-Flow graft design addresses two major problems responsible for the development of venous stenosis of prosthetic hemodialysis grafts in vitro. The new graft design should be further investigated in animal studies.",

    "abstract": "Many medical procedures undergo rapid evolution and process of care improvements after introduction. National outcome standards are useful to help physicians, institutions, and other stakeholders evaluate the quality of their programs and take action when suboptimal outcomes are identified. The purpose of this analysis was to derive contemporary risk-adjusted stroke rates from a large, contemporary, independently assessed outcome database within 30 days after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in the United States.\nThe second phase of carotid ACCULINK/ACCUNET post approval trial to uncover rare events (CAPTURE 2) is an ongoing prospective, multicenter, clinical trial conducted to assess CAS outcomes in the general practice setting after device approval for high surgical risk patients (symptomatic with >50% stenosis or asymptomatic with >80% stenosis). A neurologist examined the patients before the procedure, at 1 day and 30 days after CAS. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, any stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) within the periprocedural period. Strokes and neurologic events suspected to be strokes were adjudicated by an independent clinical events adjudication committee. Logistic regression analysis including stepwise logistic and multivariable modeling was performed to determine clinical predictors of periprocedural stroke outcome and generate a parsimonious model that could be used for a clinical standard.\nFive thousand two hundred ninety-seven consecutive patients (5297) had CAS performed by 459 physicians at 186 sites before the data cutoff of January 10, 2009. The 30-day rate of stroke was 2.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.2). Multivariable predictors of periprocedural stroke included age, symptomatic status, and dwell time of embolic protection device. A parsimonious model P(i) = 1/(1+e (-(-3.83 + 0.51 x (symptomatic) + 0.31 x (age >or=80) + 0.62 x (age >or=80 x symptomatic))), including symptomatic and octogenarian status and the term of the interaction of the two, was established based on consideration of clinical predictors, clinical interaction, and practicability.\nCAS outcomes in patients at high surgical risk have comparable periprocedural outcomes to published randomized trials of endarterectomy for patients at standard surgical risk. A model is presented for calculating a contemporary national standard for risk-adjusted stroke rates. Quality improvement measures could be based on relative performance to this benchmark and could improve overall outcomes for patients undergoing CAS.",

    "abstract": "Gender disparities, particularly among young women with cardiovascular disease, are a growing cause for concern. Depression is a prevalent and prognostically important comorbidity in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but its prevalence has not been described as a function of gender and age. Therefore, we compared depressive symptoms at the time of PAD diagnosis and 6 months later by gender and age in PAD patients.\nThe study enrolled 444 newly diagnosed patients with PAD (32% women) from two Dutch vascular outpatient clinics. Patients' depressive symptoms were assessed with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and 6 months later (CES-D scores >or=4 indicate significant depressive symptoms). Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the relationship among four gender-age groups (women <65 and >or=65 years; men <65 and >or=65 years [reference category]) and baseline and 6-month follow-up depressive symptoms.\nInitially, 33% of women <65 years had significant depressive symptoms, and 6 months later, significant depressive symptoms had developed in 19% of the other younger women. These rates were much higher than other gender-age groups (range at baseline, 11%-16%; 6-month incidence, 6%-10%; P <or= .03). Adjusting for demographics and clinical factors, women <65 years experienced a fourfold greater odds of baseline (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-8.7) and follow-up depressive symptoms (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.0-8.4) compared with men >or=65 years, whereas other gender-age groups were not at risk. Additional adjustment for change in the ankle-brachial index did not explain the increased depression risk in younger women (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2-10.2).\nSignificant depressive symptoms are more common in younger women with PAD than in other gender-age groups, both at the time of diagnosis and 6 months later. To eradicate gender-based disparities in PAD, depression screening and monitoring in younger women may be an important direction for future research and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for chronic venous insufficiency and venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to compare venous flow parameters of the lower limbs assessed by duplex ultrasound scanning in obese and nonobese individuals according to body mass index (BMI).\nVenous hemodynamics were studied in a prospective cohort study in nonobese (BMI <25 kg/m(2)) and obese individuals (BMI >30 kg/m(2)). Diameter, flow volume, peak, mean, and minimum velocities were assessed.\nThe study examined 36 limbs in 23 nonobese individuals and 44 limbs in 22 obese individuals. The diameter of the femoral vein was significantly greater in obese (8.5 +/- 2.2 mm) vs nonobese (7.1 +/- 1.6 mm; P = .0009) limbs. Venous peak and minimum velocities differed between nonobese and obese individuals (14.8 +/- 7.2 vs 10.8 +/- 4.8 cm/s [P = .0071] and 4.0 +/- 3.6 vs 1.7 +/- 6.3 cm/s [P = .056]). Calculation of venous amplitude and shear stress showed significantly higher values in nonobese vs obese (18.8 +/- 9.4 vs 12.5 +/- 9.3 cm/s [P = .003] and 2.13 +/- 2.2 dyn/cm(2) vs 1.6 +/- 2.7 dyn/cm(2) [P = .03]). Spearman rank correlation revealed a significant inverse correlation between waist-to-hip ratios and waist circumference and venous peak velocity, mean velocity, velocities amplitude (peak velocity-minimum velocity), and shear stress.\nLower limb venous flow parameters differ significantly between healthy obese and nonobese individuals. These findings support the mechanical role of abdominal adipose tissue potentially leading to elevated risk for both venous thromboembolism and chronic venous insufficiency.",

Venous peak and minimum velocities differed between nonobese and obese individuals (14.8 +/- 7.2 vs 10.8 +/- 4.8 cm/s [P = .0071] and 4.0 +/- 3.6 vs 1.7 +/- 6.3 cm/s [P = .056]). Calculation of venous amplitude and shear stress showed significantly higher values in nonobese vs obese (18.8 +/- 9.4 vs 12.5 +/- 9.3 cm/s [P = .003] and 2.13 +/- 2.2 dyn/cm(2) vs 1.6 +/- 2.7 dyn/cm(2) [P = .03]). Spearman rank correlation revealed a significant inverse correlation between waist-to-hip ratios and waist circumference and venous peak velocity, mean velocity, velocities amplitude (peak velocity-minimum velocity), and shear stress.",

A 40-year-old woman with a solitary left kidney suffered from left lumbar pain and hematuria. Imaging techniques found a large kidney with nutcracker syndrome. A totally laparoscopic transposition of the left renal vein was performed. Twelve months later, the patient is improved and has no more hematuria. Duplex scan showed no residual stenosis. Laparoscopic transposition of the left renal vein into the inferior vena cava is feasible with short length of stay and good short-term result.",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular therapy for peripheral arterial disease has undergone tremendous changes, chronic total occlusion (CTO) remains a significant challenge for interventionalists. Failed CTO recanalization is predominately due to unsuccessful guidewire crossing. In particular, the unique characteristics of tortuous and deeply located large vessels in the retroperitoneal cavity create challenging endovascular procedures. Real-time guidance based on external direct vessel visualization might be a promising tool for successful recanalization of noncalcific CTO. Here, we describe the practical use of duplex echo-guidance during the procedural course of iliac CTO recanalization.",

We investigated the mid-term efficacy of FP stenting with nitinol stents.\nThis study was a multicenter retrospective study. From April 2004 to December 2008, 511 consecutive patients (639 limbs; mean age 71 +/- 7 years; 71% male) who underwent successful FP stenting with nitinol stents for de novo lesions were retrospectively selected and analyzed in this multicenter study. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Restenosis was defined as >2.4 of peak systolic velocity ratio by duplex or >50% stenosis by angiogram. Primary patency was defined as treated vessels without restenosis and repeat revascularization. Secondary patency was defined as target vessels that become totally occluded and are reopened by repeat revascularization.\nSixty-one percent of the patients had diabetes, 76% were claudicant, and 20% were on hemodialysis. Mean lesion length was 151 +/- 75 mm. Mean follow-up period was 22 +/- 11 months. Primary patency was 79.8%, 66.7%, and 63.1%, and secondary patency was 90.4%, 87.3%, and 86.2% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. During the follow-up period, 53 patients (10%) died.

    "abstract": "Atherogenesis represents an active inflammatory process with leucocytes playing a major role. An elevated white blood cell count has been shown to be predictive of death in coronary artery disease patients. The aim of this study was to examine the predictive ability of neutrophil count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio for predicting survival in patients with critical lower limb ischemia (CLI).\nAll patients admitted to a single vascular unit with CCLI were identified prospectively over a 2-year period starting from January 2005. Patient demographics, clinical history, comorbidity, and risk factors for peripheral vascular disease were documented. The white blood count and differential cell count at admission was recorded. Overall, patient mortality was studied as the primary outcome.\nOne hundred forty-nine patients were identified, with a median age of 72 years (Interquartile range [IQR], 65.7-81). A neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of >or=5.25 was taken as the cutoff, based upon the receiver-operating-characteristic.The median follow up was 8.7 months (IQR, 3.1-16). During the follow-up period, there have been 62 deaths (43.4%). An elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and a high troponin level (>0.1) were found to be the only two factors independently associated with shorter survival on multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nThis study suggests that an elevated NLR can identify a poor-risk subset of patients among those being treated for critical limb ischemia. This simple, inexpensive test may, therefore, add to risk stratification of these high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Surgical aortic fenestration has been used for treating ischemic complications of acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD). In the current endovascular era, surgical aortic fenestration may serve as an alternative for these patients after percutaneous failure. The purpose of this study is to describe our surgical suprarenal and infrarenal aortic fenestration technique, and to report the long-term outcomes of this approach in the management of complicated ABAD.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the in-hospital and long-term outcomes of 18 patients treated with either suprarenal (n = 10) or infrarenal surgical fenestration (n = 8) for complicated ABAD between 1988 and 2002. Suprarenal fenestration was performed through a thoracoabdominal incision in the 10th intercostal space, whereas patients treated with infrarenal fenestration underwent a midline laparotomy. A longitudinal aortotomy was performed and the true and false lumens were identified, followed by a wide resection of the intimal membrane.\nMedian age was 60 years (range, 48-82 years) and 89% (n = 16) were male. The in-hospital mortality was 22% (n = 4), which included two deaths after suprarenal fenestration and two deaths after infrarenal fenestration. In the remaining patients, full visceral, renal, and lower extremity function was recovered, except for 1 patient with paraplegia at admission in which the neurologic deficit was permanent. Median follow-up of the surviving patients was 10.0 years (interquartile range, 12.5; range, 0.5-20 years). During follow-up, none of the patients developed renal or visceral ischemia, or ischemic complications to the lower extremities, and no significant dilatations of the treated aortic segments were noted. Three of 14 patients with ABAD who were discharged alive expired during the follow-up period due to causes unrelated to the surgical procedure.\nSurgical aortic fenestration represents an effective and durable option for treating ischemic complications of ABAD. Actually, this conservative surgical technique may serve as the alternative treatment in case of contraindications or failure of endovascular management of complicated ABAD.",

    "abstract": "Large randomized trials have confirmed a difference in outcome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) between men and women. In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of the gender-specific characteristics causing these perioperative and long-term outcome differences between men and women after CEA.\nA systematic search strategy with the synonyms of 'gender' and 'carotid endarterectomy' was conducted from PubMed and EMBASE databases. Only 11 relevant studies specifically discussing gender-specific related characteristics and their influence on outcome after CEA could be identified.\nDue to the limited number of included studies, pooling of findings was impossible, and results are presented in a descriptive manner. Each included study described only one possible gender-specific factor. Differences in carotid artery diameter, sex hormones, sensitivity for antiplatelet therapy, plaque morphology, occurrence of microembolic signals, and restenosis rate have all been suggested as gender-specific characteristics influencing outcome after CEA.\nHigher embolic potential in women and relatively stable female plaque morphology are the best-described factors influencing the difference in outcomes between men and women. However, the overall evidence for outcome differences by gender-specific characteristics in the literature is limited.",

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated in a murine model that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of pitavastatin into vascular endothelial cells effectively increased therapeutic neovascularization. For the development of a clinically applicable approach, further investigations are necessary to assess whether this novel system can induce the development of collateral arteries (arteriogenesis) in a chronic ischemia setting in larger animals.\nChronic hind limb ischemia was induced in rabbits. They were administered single injections of nanoparticles loaded with pitavastatin (0.05, 0.15, and 0.5 mg/kg) into ischemic muscle.\nTreatment with pitavastatin nanoparticles (0.5 mg/kg), but not other nanoparticles, induced angiographically visible arteriogenesis. The effects of intramuscular injections of phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-loaded nanoparticles, pitavastatin (0.5 mg/kg), or pitavastatin (0.5 mg/kg) nanoparticles were examined. FITC nanoparticles were detected mainly in endothelial cells of the ischemic muscles for up to 4 weeks. Treatment with pitavastatin nanoparticles, but not other treatments, induced therapeutic arteriogenesis and ameliorated exercise-induced ischemia, suggesting the development of functional collateral arteries. Pretreatment with nanoparticles loaded with vatalanib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abrogated the therapeutic effects of pitavastatin nanoparticles. Separate experiments with mice deficient for VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase demonstrated a crucial role of VEGF receptor signals in the therapeutic angiogenic effects.\nThe nanotechnology platform assessed in this study (nanoparticle-mediated endothelial cell-selective delivery of pitavastatin) may be developed as a clinically feasible and promising strategy for therapeutic arteriogenesis in patients.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an important determinant in atherosclerosis development. Various markers of oxidative stress, such as oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), nitrosative stress, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation, have been implicated in the initiation and/or progression of atherosclerosis, but their association with plaque erosion and symptomatic carotid disease has not been fully defined. In addition, certain oxidative markers have been shown in various models to promote plaque remodeling through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation.\nTo perform a global investigation of various oxidative stress markers and assess for potential relationships with destabilization and symptomatic development in human carotid plaques.\nThirty-six patients undergoing endarterectomy were evaluated and compared with 20 control specimens obtained at the time of autopsy. Differences between stable and unstable plaques, symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and >or=90% and <90% stenosis were evaluated. Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), nitrotyrosine (NT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyls (PCs) levels were determined in atheromatic plaques homogenates by corresponding biochemical assays. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was also employed to determine the percentage and topological distribution of cells expressing NT and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in serial sections from corresponding atheromatic plaques. MMP-9 expression was further verified using Western blot analysis.\nOx-LDL was increased in symptomatic patients (P < .05). Also, ox-LDL and NT levels were significantly higher in unstable versus stable carotid plaques (P < .05, respectively). Furthermore, IHC serial section analysis, corroborated by statistical analysis, showed a topological and expressional correlation between NT and MMP-9 (P < .05). MDA and PCs levels, although increased in carotid plaques, did not distinguish stable from unstable carotid plaques as well as symptomatic from asymptomatic patients with various degrees of stenosis.\nAll types of investigated oxidative stress markers were significantly increased in human carotid plaques, but only ox-LDL levels were associated with clinical symptoms, while peroxynitrite products and MMP-9 were specifically related to plaque instability.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic alterations of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) appear critical to the development of primary varicose veins. Previous study indicated desmuslin, an intermediate filament protein, was differentially expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from varicose veins; thus, it was naturally hypothesized that altered desmuslin expression might in turn affect the functioning of VSMCs, leading to the phenotypic alterations and varicose vein development.\nIn this study, expression of desmuslin in normal human saphenous vein SMCs was knocked down using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and control cells were treated with a scrambled siRNA sequence. The levels of several phenotypic markers including smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) were assessed. Collagen formation, matrix metalloproteinase expression (MMP-2), and cytoskeletal and morphological changes were also examined.\nSMCs treated with desmuslin siRNA exhibited significantly increased levels of collagen synthesis and MMP-2 expression and decreased expression levels of SM alpha-actin, SM-MHC, and smoothelin and exhibited disassembly of actin stress fibers when compared with the control cells. Changes in cell morphology and actin fiber networks in VSMCs treated with desmuslin siRNA were consistent with a lower degree of differentiation.\nThese results indicated desmuslin expression is required for the maintenance of VSMC phenotype. Decreased desmuslin expression may affect differentiation of VSMCs and ultimately contribute to the development of varicose veins.",

In 57 (52%), in situ revascularization of the abdominal aorta with Y-prosthesis constructed from CAHs was performed. Early outcome included 30-day mortality and the levels of daily blood markers (leucocytes, C-reactive protein, and platelets) during the postsurgical 10-day period. We reported long-term survival and freedom from reoperation rates, including all indications for reoperation.\nIndications for operation were infected vascular graft in 31 patients (55%), aortodigestive fistulae in 11 (19%), nonruptured mycotic aneurysms in 4 (7%), and ruptured mycotic aneurysms of abdominal aorta in 11 (19%). In 39 of 57 patients (68%), the intraoperative specimens were positive for at least one microorganism, and Staphylococcus aureus was present in 14 (25%). In 32 patients (82%) with intraoperative specimens positive for microorganisms, there was no evidence of the intraoperatively detected microorganisms in the postoperative specimens (wound, blood culture, and drainage fluid). The peak value of leucocytes (13.7 +/- 4.4 x 10(3)/L) and C-reactive protein (200 +/- 75 mg/L) occurred on postoperative day 3. Platelets reached the lowest value on postoperative day 2 (178 +/- 67 x 10(9)/L). Median peak body temperature was 37.7 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C. Thirty-day mortality was 9% (5 of 57 patients). Median follow-up was 36 months (range, 4-118 months); 3-year survival was 81%, and freedom from reoperation was 89%. Five patients (9%) required reoperation, in one patient each for postoperative bleeding, acute cholecystitis, homograft occlusion, homograft-duodenum fistula, and aneurysmal degeneration. No recurrence of infection was reported.\nThese results demonstrate an encouraging outcome after cryopreserved allograft implantation for the treatment of vascular infections in the abdominal aorta.

    "abstract": "Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis, the use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters when anticoagulation has failed or when contraindicated remains a safe and effective treatment. Greenfield (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) and TrapEase (Cordis, Bridgewater, NJ) filters are arguably among the most popular filtration devices. The Greenfield filter (12F introducer) has been in use for >30 years and has been well studied. The TrapEase filter (6F introducer) has been used since 2000, with a limited number of studies. Good guidelines to help determine which filter to use in any given situation are lacking; therefore, this randomized study prospectively compared the clinical outcomes (access-site thrombosis, filter thrombosis, and symptomatic pulmonary embolism [PE]) between these filters.\nBetween July 2006 and November 2008, 156 patients (63 men, 93 women; mean age, 75 years; range, 38-101 years) were randomized: 84 to Greenfield and 72 to TrapEase IVC filter insertion in the infrarenal position using angiographic guidance. Postoperative follow-up comprised serial lower extremity and IVC/iliac vein (IV) duplex imaging (78.2%) at day 1, week 1, every 3 months for the first year, and every 6 months for the second year; clinical evaluation, and clinic visits. During this period, 349 patients (143 men, 206 women; mean age, 75 years; range, 24-96 years) were not randomized.\nThe indications for filter placement, in the 156 randomized patients, were gastrointestinal bleeding, 37; intracranial hemorrhage, 12; free-floating clot, 19; failure of anticoagulation, 29; PE, 27; prophylactic, 4; and others, 32. During a mean 12-month follow-up (range, 0-39 months), symptomatic IVC/IV thrombosis developed in five patients (6.94%) in the TrapEase group and none in the Greenfield group (P = .019). No filter migration, access-site thrombosis, misplacement, or IVC perforation occurred. Recurrent PE was suspected in one of the five patients with IVC/IV thrombosis. Overall mortality was 42.3% (66 patients), and 30-day mortality was 13.5% (21 patients: 10 TrapEase, 11 Greenfield). The study was initially designed to recruit 360 patients in both TrapEase and Greenfield filters in 2 years to demonstrate any statistical significance but was prematurely concluded due to the interim results.\nA higher rate of symptomatic IVC/IV thrombosis is associated with TrapEase filter placement. However, the TrapEase filter still has a selective clinical role in the prevention of thromboembolism in selected patients who are coagulopathic. This is the first randomized prospective study comparing IVC filters since their inception in 1967.",

Thrombolysis, a temporary inferior cava filter (ICV filter), and tangential aneurysmectomy and lateral venorrhaphy were performed. Accurate duplex scan evaluation of lower limb venous system is mandatory in all cases of pulmonary embolism; anticoagulation may be ineffective in preventing pulmonary embolism, and the surgical repair is treatment of choice of this pathology because it is safe and effective.",

    "abstract": "Haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism is associated with the prevalence and clinical evolution of many inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis. Circulating neutrophils and neutrophil-associated proteases are an important initial component of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. Elastase and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are elevated in patients with AAAs. This study assessed the relationship between AAA expansion and Hp phenotypes, neutrophil count, elastase, and CRP levels.\nEighty-three consecutive AAA patients underwent annual ultrasound scans. Three major Hp phenotypes (1-1, 2-1, and 2-2) were determined, and the neutrophil count, serum elastase, and high-sensitivity (hs) CRP levels were measured at the initial examination. After initial screening, patients were rescanned at 6- to 12-month intervals up to a period of 2 to 7 years. The mean yearly growth of the AAA largest transverse diameter was estimated for each group of Hp patients. The results are presented as median (interquartile range).\nHp 2-1 patients had a significantly higher growth rate (3.69 [2.40] mm/y) of AAA compared with patients with Hp 2-2 (1.24 [0.79], P < .00001) and Hp 1-1 (1.45 [0.68], P = .00004). This association remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Elevated elastase serum activity was also evident in AAA patients with Hp 2-1 (0.119 [0.084] arbitrary units) in contrast to Hp 2-2 (0.064 [0.041], P < .00001) and Hp 1-1 (0.071 [0.040], P = .0006) patients. CRP serum levels (mg/L) were significantly higher in patients with Hp 2-1 (7.2 [7.1]) than in Hp 2-2 (3.4 [3.1], P = .0058) and Hp 1-1 (2.8 [4.1], P = .044). The neutrophil count was not significantly different among Hp groups.\nThe Hp 2-1 phenotype showed a strong association with increased rates of the expansion of AAAs and may be a useful independent predictor of growth rate. Further large follow-up studies will be needed to investigate the pathomechanisms of association and the role of elastase and inflammation in the progression of AAA.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the predictive value of histologic plaque characteristics for the occurrence of restenosis after femoral artery endarterectomy.\nIt would be advantageous if patients at increased risk for restenosis after arterial endarterectomy could be identified by histologic characteristics of the dissected plaque. Differences in atherosclerotic plaque composition of the carotid artery have been associated with restenosis rates after surgical endarterectomy. However, whether atherosclerotic plaque characteristics are also predictive for restenosis in other vascular territories is unknown.\nAtherosclerotic plaques of 217 patients who underwent a common femoral artery endarterectomy (CFAE; n = 124) or remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE; n = 93) were examined and scored microscopically for the presence of collagen, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, lipid core, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcifications. The 12-month restenosis rate was assessed using duplex ultrasound imaging (peak systolic velocity [PSV] ratio >or=2.5).\nThe 1-year restenosis rate was 66% (61 of 93) after RSFAE compared to 21% (26 of 124) after CFAE. Plaque with characteristics of high collagen and smooth muscle cell content were positively associated with the occurrence of restenosis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-4.68) and 2.20 (1.50-3.20) for superficial femoral artery (SFA) and common femoral artery (CFA), respectively. SFA plaques showed significantly heavier staining for collagen (69% vs 31% for CFA; P < .001) and smooth muscle cells (64% vs 36% for CFA; P < .001). After multivariate analysis, the operation type (CFAE or RSFAE), gender, and the presence of collagen were independent predictive variables for restenosis after endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA.\nPlaque composition of the CFA and SFA differs. Furthermore, the dissection of a fibrous collagen-rich plaque is an independent predictive variable for restenosis after endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA.",

    "abstract": "The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a widely used model for predicting cardiac events after noncardiac surgery. We compared the accuracy of the RCRI with a new, vascular surgery-specific model developed from patients within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE).\nWe studied 10,081 patients who underwent nonemergent carotid endarterectomy (CEA; n = 5293), lower extremity bypass (LEB; n = 2673), endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR; n = 1005), and open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (OAAA; n = 1,110) within the VSGNE from 2003 to 2008. First, we analyzed the ability of the RCRI to predict in-hospital major adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure (CHF) in the VSGNE cohort. Second, we used a derivation cohort of 8208 to develop a new cardiac risk prediction model specifically for vascular surgery patients. Chi-square analysis identified univariate predictors, and multivariate logistic regression was used to develop an aggregate and four procedure-specific risk prediction models for cardiac complications. Calibration and model discrimination were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The ability of the model to predict cardiac complications was assessed within a validation cohort of 1873. Significant predictors were converted to an integer score to create a practical cardiac risk prediction formula.\nThe overall incidence of major cardiac events in the VSGNE cohort was 6.3% (2.5% MI, 3.9% arrhythmia, 1.8% CHF). The RCRI predicted risk after CEA reasonably well but substantially underestimated risk after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA for low- and higher-risk patients. Across all VSGNE patients, the RCRI underestimated cardiac complications by 1.7- to 7.4-fold based on actual event rates of 2.6%, 6.7%, 11.6%, and 18.4% for patients with 0, 1, 2, and >or=3 risk factors. In multivariate analysis of the VSGNE cohort, independent predictors of adverse cardiac events were (odds ratio [OR]) increasing age (1.7-2.8), smoking (1.3), insulin-dependent diabetes (1.4), coronary artery disease (1.4), CHF (1.9), abnormal cardiac stress test (1.2), long-term beta-blocker therapy (1.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.6), and creatinine >or=1.8 mg/dL (1.7). Prior cardiac revascularization was protective (OR, 0.8). Our aggregate model was well calibrated (r = 0.99, P < .001), demonstrating moderate discriminative ability (ROC curve = 0.71), which differed only slightly from the procedure-specific models (ROC curves: CEA, 0.74; LEB, 0.72; EVAR, 0.74; OAAA, 0.68). Rates of cardiac complications for patients with 0 to 3, 4, 5, and >or=6 VSG risk factors were 3.1%, 5.0%, 6.8%, and 11.6% in the derivation cohort and 3.8%, 5.2%, 8.1%, and 10.1% in the validation cohort. The VSGNE cardiac risk model more accurately predicted the actual risk of cardiac complications across the four procedures for low- and higher-risk patients than the RCRI. When the VSG Cardiac Risk Index (VSG-CRI) was used to score patients, six categories of risk ranging from 2.6% to 14.3% (score of 0-3 to 8) were discernible.\nThe RCRI substantially underestimates in-hospital cardiac events in patients undergoing elective or urgent vascular surgery, especially after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA. The VSG-CRI more accurately predicts in-hospital cardiac events after vascular surgery and represents an important tool for clinical decision making.",

Across all VSGNE patients, the RCRI underestimated cardiac complications by 1.7- to 7.4-fold based on actual event rates of 2.6%, 6.7%, 11.6%, and 18.4% for patients with 0, 1, 2, and >or=3 risk factors. In multivariate analysis of the VSGNE cohort, independent predictors of adverse cardiac events were (odds ratio [OR]) increasing age (1.7-2.8), smoking (1.3), insulin-dependent diabetes (1.4), coronary artery disease (1.4), CHF (1.9), abnormal cardiac stress test (1.2), long-term beta-blocker therapy (1.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.6), and creatinine >or=1.8 mg/dL (1.7). Prior cardiac revascularization was protective (OR, 0.8). Our aggregate model was well calibrated (r = 0.99, P < .001), demonstrating moderate discriminative ability (ROC curve = 0.71), which differed only slightly from the procedure-specific models (ROC curves: CEA, 0.74; LEB, 0.72; EVAR, 0.74; OAAA, 0.68). Rates of cardiac complications for patients with 0 to 3, 4, 5, and >or=6 VSG risk factors were 3.1%, 5.0%, 6.8%, and 11.6% in the derivation cohort and 3.8%, 5.2%, 8.1%, and 10.1% in the validation cohort. The VSGNE cardiac risk model more accurately predicted the actual risk of cardiac complications across the four procedures for low- and higher-risk patients than the RCRI. When the VSG Cardiac Risk Index (VSG-CRI) was used to score patients, six categories of risk ranging from 2.6% to 14.3% (score of 0-3 to 8) were discernible.",

This study determined the incidence and risk factors for symptomatic perioperative VTE in patients with a prior diagnosis of DVT.\nAll lower extremity DVTs, diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2006, were identified through a vascular database. Patients who had subsequent surgery were reviewed. The following data were evaluated: location of DVT, time interval between DVT and surgery, type of surgery, common clinical VTE risk factors, postoperative venous duplex scans, computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, and ventilation-perfusion scans.\nA total of 372 patients with prior DVT underwent 1081 subsequent surgical procedures. One hundred nine patients undergoing 211 procedures had a follow-up venous duplex scan within 30 days after surgery. Of them, 46% received an inferior vena caval (IVC) filter, and pulmonary emboli were diagnosed in 3 patients (<1%). Overall, 24% of the patients developed DVT extension or new-site DVT in the perioperative period. The median time interval between the original DVT and surgery was 1.5 weeks in patients with DVT recurrence and 4 weeks in patients without recurrence (P = .22, Mann-Whitney). High-risk surgeries were associated with a >three-fold increased risk for recurrence, when compared with low-risk procedures (34% vs 11%; P = .009, chi(2)). Perioperative VTE recurrence was not influenced by the location of the original thrombus or other VTE risk factors.\nIn patients with prior DVT, perioperative symptomatic recurrence is common and is associated with high-risk procedures. A longer time interval between a DVT episode and subsequent surgery may decrease the risk of recurrence, but large clinical trials are needed to confirm this.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the durability of nitinol stent placement in high-risk patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) and infrapopliteal lesions after suboptimal balloon angioplasty.\nBetween January 2006 and January 2009, 53 high-risk patients (24 women; mean age, 71.8 +/- 5.1 years) with CLI underwent infragenicular stent placement with a 4F sheath-compatible self-expanding nitinol stent. Patients had three or more serious cardiopulmonary comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery occlusive disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists score >/=3, previous myocardial infarction, coronary stent or bypass, or infection after peripheral revascularization. Endovascular therapy was performed in 30 stenoses and 23 occlusions in 53 patients. The mean stenosis length was 5.5 +/- 1.9 cm. The mean occlusion length was 6.5 +/- 2.9 cm. The mean follow-up was 24.1 +/- 7.3 months and consisted of clinical examination, ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements, and duplex ultrasound imaging. Digital subtraction angiography was performed if restenosis or reocclusion was suspected.\nThe technical success rate was 98.1%. The 24-month cumulative primary patency rate was 75.5%. During the follow-up, two patients underwent successful repeat angioplasty, and four patients required crural bypass. The 24-month secondary patency and freedom from amputation rates were 88.7% and 88.7%, respectively. The mean ABI increased significantly at 12 and 24 months (P < .001). Risk stratification to detect predictors that influenced the patency rate showed that proximal lesions had significant better patency than distal crural lesions (83.3% vs 65.2%, P = .04). The morphology of the lesions (stenoses vs occlusions, P = .88) did not seem to influence primary patency. Four patients died from nonprocedure-related causes during the follow-up, including lung cancer, myocardial infarction, and glioblastoma multiforme. No procedure-related deaths were recorded.\nThe 2-year outcome of our series underscores the value of infrapopliteal nitinol stent placement as a durable bailout treatment option in high-risk CLI patients with suboptimal angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Incidental abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are identified during imaging for other reasons. Incidental AAAs are important findings because they require monitoring and surgical treatment, when indicated, to prevent rupture. The prevalence of incidental AAAs and their management has not been extensively studied.\nWe electronically screened a 25% simple random sample of abdominal computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies conducted between 1996 and 2008 at one academic medical center. Screen-positive reports were manually reviewed to determine if they showed an incidental AAA. We reviewed the medical records of all in-patients to determine whether the incidental AAA was documented, a treatment plan was identified, and whether it was communicated to the patient's family physician through the discharge summary. We used evidence-based recommended schedules to determine the adequacy of AAA monitoring for each person.\nIn 79,121 abdominal images, we identified 812 incidental AAAs (1.0% of all studies) or 364 incidental AAAs annually (95% confidence interval [CI], 349-379).

    "abstract": "It remains unclear whether population-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men reduces all-cause long-term mortality. We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of AAA screening for prevention of long-term mortality in men.\nTo identify all randomized controlled trials of population-based AAA screening with long-term (\u2265 10 year) follow-up in men, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through June 2009. Data regarding AAA-related and all-cause mortality (including Cox regression hazard ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were abstracted from each individual study. For each study, data regarding mortality in both the screening and control groups were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic ORs or HRs (or risk ratios where no HR was reported) in both fixed- and random-effects models.\nOur search identified four randomized controlled trials of population-based AAA screening with long-term follow-up in men aged \u2265 65 years. Pooled analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (random-effects OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.86; P = .008; P for heterogeneity = .01; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 4 per 1000; number needed to screen [NNS], 238; random-effects HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.86; P = .009; P for heterogeneity = .009) and revealed a statistically nonsignificant reduction (but a strong trend toward a significant reduction) in all-cause mortality (fixed-effects OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.00 [1.001]; P = .06; P for heterogeneity = .93; ARR, 5 per 1000; NNS, 217; fixed-effects HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.00 [1.0001]; P \u2265 .05 [P = .052]; P for heterogeneity = .74) with AAA screening relative to control.\nThe results of our analysis suggest that population-based screening for AAA reduces AAA-related long-term mortality by 4 per 1000 over control in men aged \u2265 65 years. Whereas, screening for AAA shows a strong trend toward a significant reduction in all-cause long-term mortality by 5 per 1000, which does not narrowly reach statistical significance.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of ischemic events, arterial pathology at the thoracic outlet (TO) is rarely identified because findings of chronic arterial pathology may be masked by symptoms of neurogenic compression. This study describes the clinical presentations and significance of arterial compression at the TO.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of the clinical records and imaging studies of 41 patients with objective findings of arterial compression at the TO. Sixteen were diagnosed from 1990 to 2003, during which 284 patients underwent surgery for TO decompression with selective arterial imaging; 25 were diagnosed from 2003 to 2009, and 62 underwent TO surgical decompressions.\nSubclavian artery stenosis, with or without poststenotic dilatation (PSD), was found in 26 patients (63%), subclavian artery aneurysms in 12 (29%), chronic subclavian occlusion in 1(2.4%), and axillary artery compression in 2 (5%). Chronic symptoms difficult to discern from neurogenic compression were present in 27 patients (66%; 24 had subclavian stenoses or PSD, or both, 1 had subclavian occlusion, and 2 had axillary artery compression); 13 (32%) presented with acute ischemia (11 had aneurysms and 2 had PSDs), and 1 asymptomatic patient had a subclavian aneurysm. Osteoarticular anomalies were found in 27 patients (66%), including 19 cervical ribs, 4 first rib anomalies, and 4 clavicular or first rib fractures, or both. Among 27 patients with subclavian aneurysms or PSD, 21 (78%) had a bone anomaly. Arterial pathology was deemed significant in 30 patients (73%) and mild or moderate in 11 (21%). Symptoms in 23 of these patients were compatible with neurogenic compression without clinical suspicion of arterial pathology, but 13 (56%) harbored a significant arterial anomaly.\nThe incidence of arterial pathology secondary to compression at the TO may be underestimated, and in the absence of obvious ischemia, significant arterial pathology may not be suspected. Two-thirds of patients with arterial compression have associated bone anomalies. Therefore, routine arterial imaging seems advisable for patients evaluated for TO syndrome in the presence of a bone anomaly at the TO or an examination that shows an arterial abnormality. In the absence of these signs, however, arterial pathology may be overlooked in patients with symptoms suggestive of neurogenic compression. Further study is needed to elucidate the incidence, natural history, and clinical relevance of arterial compression and PSD at the TO.",

    "abstract": "With increased use of subintimal angioplasty (SIA), the role of reintervention after recurrence is currently unknown. To more clearly define the technical feasibility, patency, and clinical outcomes of reinterventions after SIA, we reviewed our cumulative experience.\nA retrospective review of patient information (including demographics, indications, procedures, noninvasive arterial studies, and postprocedural events) was performed on those patients undergoing reintervention after a primary subintimal angioplasty in the infrainguinal vessels. Continuous and noncontinuous data were compared using the Student t-test and the z test, respectively. Patency was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Survival curves were compared using log-rank and Wilcoxon testing for univariate analysis and Cox hazard-regression analysis for multivariate analysis.\nFrom December 2002, through July 2006, 495 SIAs were performed for infrainguinal disease in 482 patients. Of this cohort, 121 patients (25%) required 188 consecutive reinterventions. Each patient underwent an average of 1.5 +/- 0.8 (range, 1-7) reinterventions during this study. We analyzed only the outcomes of 124 consecutive, first reinterventions. Mean interval time between primary SIA and the first reintervention was 7.8 +/- 6.8 months (range, 1 day-31 months). Indications for reintervention were clinical only (recurrence of symptoms or worsening exam), diagnostics only (recurrence based on peripheral vascular lab studies), or both in 18%, 25%, and 52% of patients, respectively. Technical success was achieved in 94% (n = 117) of the procedures. Repeat SIA technique was utilized in 68% (n = 84) of reinterventions and other endovascular therapies (32%; n = 40), of which the majority were transluminal angioplasty, for the remaining reinterventions. Mean follow-up was 8.6 months (range, 0-34 months). The patency rate at 1 year for the first reintervention was 33%. One-year patency rates for reinterventions performed within 3 months of the primary SIA were worse than those performed after 3 months (22% vs 34%; P = .04). In addition, patients treated for claudication had better 1-year patency than those treated for critical limb ischemia (37% vs 27%; P = .03). Other demographic or procedural variables did not significantly affect patency. In patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), limb salvage rate at 1 year was 71%.\nEndovascular reintervention after SIA is a safe and technically feasible procedure for recurrences and offers good limb salvage rate. Early reinterventions performed within 3 months of the original SIA portend a worse outcome. In addition, reinterventions are less durable in patients with CLI compared with claudication. Finally, by identifying a recurrent stenosis instead of an occlusion, close surveillance may contribute to improved overall outcome.",

    "abstract": "Hypothermia is widely used to mediate ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with repair of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Experiments were designed in a murine model of thoracic aortic ischemia-reperfusion (TAR) to evaluate the effect of moderate systemic hypothermia on neurologic function, spinal cord morphology, and indices of inflammation in critical organs.\nC57BL/6 mice were subjected to TAR under hypothermic (34 degrees C) or normothermic (38 degrees C) conditions, followed by 24 or 48 hours of normothermic reperfusion. Neurologic functions were assessed during reperfusion. Spinal cords were examined at 24 and 48 hours after reperfusion, and the degree of injury qualified by counting the number of viable motor neurons within the anterior horns. Keratinocyte chemokine, interleukin-6, and myeloperoxidase levels were measured from lung, liver, and kidney at 24 and 48 hours.\nNormothermic TAR resulted in a dense neurologic deficit in all mice throughout the reperfusion period. Mice subjected to TAR under hypothermic conditions had transient, mild neurologic deficit during the initial periods of reperfusion. Between 24 and 48 hours, delayed paralysis developed in half of these mice, whereas the other half remained neurologically intact. Spinal cord histology showed a graded degree of injury that correlated with neurologic function. There was no correlation between markers of inflammation in various organs and neurologic outcomes following TAR.\nSystemic moderate hypothermia was protective against immediate paralysis after TAR in all cases and was associated with delayed paralysis in 50% of mice. This study suggests that delayed-onset paralysis may be the result of a local insult, rather than a systemic inflammatory event, precipitating spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "Cryoplasty has been proposed as a different therapy to address the problems of recurrent lesions. We reviewed our experience with cryoplasty to determine its outcome treating patients with lesions in native vessels and within stents.\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing cryotherapy between 2004 and 2008 was conducted. Patency was defined by at least one of the following criteria: flow through the vessel demonstrated by angiography or duplex ultrasonography, maintenance of an ankle-brachial index (ABI) greater than 0.10 above the preprocedural value, or maintenance of a palpable pedal pulse that was absent before the procedure in an asymptomatic patient. Patency, limb salvage, symptomatic improvement, and freedom from surgical bypass were determined with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared by log-rank testing. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional-hazards regression.\nEighty-eight cryoplasty procedures were performed in 71 patients, with 35 procedures for in-stent restenosis and 37 for native vessel disease. Sixteen of 88 procedures in grafts were excluded from analysis secondary to combined disease process and/or bypass graft stenosis. Lesions treated with cryoplasty had an average of 2.9 prior endovascular interventions. Eighty-five percent of the lesions were described as complex (multifocal, diffuse, or occlusion) and the mean lesion length was 15 +/- 10 cm. Initial cryoplasty technical success rate was 68% (25 of 37) for native vessels and 71% (25 of 35) for in-stent procedures. One year primary patency for the native vs stent group was 17% vs 28%, respectively (P = .18). The 1-year primary assisted patency for the native vs stent group was 28% vs 47%, respectively (P = .33). The 1-year secondary patency for the native vs stent group was 41% vs 57% (P = .42), respectively. Freedom from claudication at 1 year for the native vs stent group was 32% vs 21% (P = .80). Compared to balloon angioplasty, cryoplasty has an averaged up-cost of $1851.50 per procedure.\nCryoplasty was used in patients with extensive disease and multiple prior interventions. Cryoplasty provided poor patency rates and poor relief from claudication at 1 year in this population. Overall, cryoplasty seems to be an expensive endovascular tool with marginal clinical improvement in our experience.",

    "abstract": "Endograft migration is usually described as a downward displacement of the endograft with respect to the renal arteries. However, change in endograft position is actually a complex process in three-dimensional (3D) space. Currently, there are no established techniques to define such positional changes over time. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the direction of aortic endograft movement as observed in follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans is related to the directional displacement force acting on the endograft.\nWe quantitated the 3D positional change over time of five abdominal endografts by determining the endograft centroid at baseline (postoperative scan) and on follow-up CT scans. The time interval between CT scans for the 5 patients ranged from 8 months to 8 years. We then used 3D image segmentation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to quantitate the pulsatile displacement force (in Newtons [N]) acting on the endografts in the postoperative configurations. Finally, we calculated a correlation metric between the direction of the displacement force vector and the endograft movement by computing the cosine of the angle of these two vectors.\nThe average 3D movement of the endograft centroid was 18 mm (range, 9-29 mm) with greater movement in patients with longer follow-up times. In all cases, the movement of the endograft had significant components in all three spatial directions: Two of the endografts had the largest component of movement in the transverse direction, whereas three endografts had the largest component of movement in the axial direction. The magnitude and orientation of the endograft displacement force varied depending on aortic angulation and hemodynamic conditions. The average magnitude of displacement force for all endografts was 5.8 N (range, 3.7-9.5 N). The orientation of displacement force was in general perpendicular to the greatest curvature of the endograft. The average correlation metric, defined as the cosine of the angle between the displacement force and the endograft centroid movement, was 0.38 (range, 0.08-0.66).\nComputational methods applied to patient-specific postoperative image data can be used to quantitate 3D displacement force and movement of endografts over time. It appears that endograft movement is related to the magnitude and direction of the displacement force acting on aortic endografts. These methods can be used to increase our understanding of clinical endograft migration.",

In all cases, the movement of the endograft had significant components in all three spatial directions: Two of the endografts had the largest component of movement in the transverse direction, whereas three endografts had the largest component of movement in the axial direction. The magnitude and orientation of the endograft displacement force varied depending on aortic angulation and hemodynamic conditions. The average magnitude of displacement force for all endografts was 5.8 N (range, 3.7-9.5 N). The orientation of displacement force was in general perpendicular to the greatest curvature of the endograft. The average correlation metric, defined as the cosine of the angle between the displacement force and the endograft centroid movement, was 0.38 (range, 0.08-0.66).",

    "abstract": "There is remarkable controversy over the processes driving abdominal aneurysm growth. The inherent limitations of animal and human studies hamper elucidation of the key inflammatory and proteolytic processes. Human data are largely derived from surgical specimens that typically reflect the final stages of the disease process and thus do not allow distinction between primary and secondary processes. Clear epidemiologic and genetic associations between abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA) suggest that that these two pathologies share common grounds. On this basis, we reasoned that information of corresponding and discordant processes in these aneurysms might provide critical clues on the processes that are crucial for aneurysm progression.\nMessenger RNA (semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) and protein analysis (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, multiplex, Western blotting), and histology were performed on aneurysm wall samples obtained during elective PAA and AAA repair. Nonaneurysmal aorta tissue from organ donors was included as reference.\nMessenger RNA and protein analysis showed that PAA and AAA are both characterized by a marked activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) proinflammatory transcription factors, and hyperexpression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Discordant findings were found for other inflammatory markers such as interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha and beta, which were all lower in PAA. On the cellular level, both pathologies exhibited profuse infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and T-helper cells. Results for B cells, plasma cells, and cytotoxic T cells were discordant, with minimal infiltration of these cell types in PAA. Evaluation of protease expression and activation showed that both conditions are dominated by increased matrix metalloproteinase 8 and 9, and cathepsin K, L and S expression and activation.\nThis explorative study characterizes degenerative aneurysmal disease general inflammatory conditions that are dominated by profound activation of the NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways, hyperexpression of IL-6 and IL-8, and neutrophil involvement. Discordant findings for interferon gamma, cytotoxic T cells, B cells, and plasma cells challenge a critical role for these factors in the process of aneurysm growth. Pharmaceutic strategies targeting the common components in AAA and PAA may prove effective for the stabilization of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid reconstructions have been increasingly used for multilevel revascularization procedures as surgeons have embraced endovascular interventions. The goal of this study is to define the role of simple and complex hybrid techniques in patients who need multilevel revascularization.\nAll patients undergoing arterial revascularization (endovascular [EV], open, hybrid) between June 2001 and May 2008 were included. Hybrid procedures were stratified as simple (sHYBRID group) when the endovascular-treated segment was TransAtlantic Society Consensus II (TASC) A/B, and complex (cHYBRID group), when TASC C/D.\nOf the 654 patients, 770 limbs (67% critical limb ischemia), 226 (29%) had open, 436 (57%) had endovascular, and 108 (14%) had hybrid procedures (56 sHYBRID, 52 cHYBRID). The HYBRID group was more likely to have hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) 4, and aortoiliac reconstructions, with more ASA 4 in the cHYBRID than the sHYBRID group. Length of stay in the HYBRID group was significantly longer than the EV group, but less than open-treated groups. Endovascular intervention was performed for inflow in 85%, for runoff in 5%, and for both inflow and runoff in the remaining 10% of hybrid cases. Eleven (20%) sHYBRID cases were staged, while all cHYBRID cases were performed simultaneously. Femoral endarterectomy was more frequent in cHYBRID (75% vs 23% in sHYBRID), infrainguinal bypass (17% vs 55%) was more common in sHYBRID, the remainder being femoro-femoral bypasses (8% vs 21%). Endovascular procedures were primarily iliac interventions (91% in sHYBRID, 88% in cHYBRID). Thirty-day myocardial infarction/death rate was significantly higher in the HYBRID than the EV group, with no difference within the HYBRID group. The patency rates were similar in the sHYBRID and cHYBRID groups, and comparable to the endovascular and open treated patients with similar disease complexity. Limb salvage in patients who presented with critical limb ischemia was better in the cHYBRID group than other groups. Overall survival was similar in all groups.\nComplex and simple hybrid procedures enable multilevel revascularizations in high-risk patients with comparable patency and limb salvage. Femoral endarterectomy plays a central role, especially in complex hybrid repairs. An increase in perioperative morbidity and mortality was observed in the hybrid group, likely due to attempting revascularization in higher risk patients.",

Indications included asymptomatic patients (stenosis >80%), symptomatic patients (stenosis >60%), and ulcerated lesions (>50%). Stent integrity was assessed with plain radiography at 12 months. Data were analyzed in April 2009 on a series of 341 consecutive patients treated with carotid artery stenting with at least 12 months follow-up.\nStent fracture prevalence was 3.4% at 12 months (95% confidence interval, 1.7%-6.1%). The median clinical follow-up was 30 months (range, 12-64 months) for 323 eligible patients. Treatment included 23.6% of symptomatic patients. According to univariate analysis, calcification type III increased the odds of stent fracture by more than 4.5 times (odds ratio [OR], 4.74; P = .006) and angulation >45 degrees increased the odds of stent fracture by 6.5 times (OR, 6.51; P = .008). Carotid stent cell type, stent length, and stent over-sizing were not correlated with stent fracture incidence. Stent fracture was not associated with stroke (0%), transient ischemic attack (0%), or death (0%). Restenosis was significantly associated with stent fracture (P < .001). Multivariate analysis evidenced that type III calcification (OR, 3.90; P = .029) and angulation >45 degrees (OR, 4.69; P = .026) were important risk factors for carotid stent fracture.\nCarotid stent fracture is a rare complication after CAS and is associated with vessel angulation, calcification, and restenosis. In this series, fracture identification was independent of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and mortality.",

The aortic aneurysm diameter was defined as the major axis on the centerline images of 3-D CT reconstruction. This was compared with US-derived minor and major axis measurements, as well as with the minor axis measurement on the conventional axial CT images. Correlation was evaluated with linear regression analyses. Agreement between different imaging modalities and measurements was assessed with Bland-Altman plots.\nThe correlation coefficients from linear regression analyses were 0.92 between CT centerline major and US minor measurements, 0.94 between CT centerline major and US major measurements, and 0.93 between CT minor and centerline major measurements. Bland-Altman plots showed a mean difference of 0.11 mm between US major and CT centerline measurements compared with 5.38 mm between US minor and CT centerline measurements, and 4.25 mm between axial CT minor and centerline measurements. This suggested that, compared with axial CT and US minor axis measurements, US major axis measurements were in better agreement with CT centerline measurements. Variability between major and minor US and CT centerline diameter measurements was high (standard deviation of difference, 4.27-4.84 mm). However, high variability was also observed between axial CT measurements and centerline CT measurements (standard deviation of difference, 4.36 mm).\nThe major axis aneurysm diameter measurement obtained by US imaging for surveillance after EVAR correlates well and is in better agreement with centerline 3-D CT reconstruction diameters than axial CT.",

    "abstract": "Proximal attachment failure, often leading to graft migration, is a severe complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Aortic cuffs have been used to treat proximal attachment failure with mixed results. The Zenith Renu AAA Ancillary Graft (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind) is available in two configurations: converter and main body extension. Both provide proximal extension with active fixation for the treatment of pre-existing endovascular grafts with failed or failing proximal fixation or seal in patients who are not surgical candidates. We prospectively compared the outcomes of patient treatment with these two device configurations.\nFrom September 2005 to May 2008, a prospective, nonrandomized, postmarket registry was conducted to collect data from 151 patients treated at 95 institutions for proximal aortic endovascular graft failure using the Renu graft. Treatment indications included inadequate proximal fixation or seal, for example, migration, and type I and III endoleak. A total of 136 patients (90%) had migration, 111 (74%) had endoleak, and 94 (62%) had endoleaks and graft migration. AneuRx grafts were present in 126 patients (83%), of which 89 (59%) were treated with a converter and 62 (41%) with a main body extension. Outcomes using converters vs main body extensions for endoleak rates, changes in aneurysm size, and ruptures were compared.\nPreprocedural demographics between the two groups did not differ significantly. Procedural success rates were 98% for the converter group and 100% for the main body extension group. At a mean follow-up of 12.8 +/- 7.5 months, no type III endoleaks (0%)were identified in the converter group, and five (8%) were identified in the main body extension group. There were no aneurysm ruptures in patients treated with converters (0%) and three ruptures (5%) in patients treated with main body extensions. Each patient with aneurysm rupture had been treated with a Renu main body extension, developed a type III endoleak, and underwent surgical conversion. Two of the three patients died postoperatively.\nProximal attachment failure and graft migration are potentially lethal complications of EVAR. Proximal graft extension using an aortic cuff is the easiest technique for salvaging an endovascular graft. Unfortunately, it has a predictable failure mode (development of a type III endoleak due to component separation) and is associated with a significantly higher failure rate than with the use of a converter. EVAR salvage with a converter and a femorofemoral bypass is a more complex but superior option for endovascular graft salvage.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated longitudinal trends in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management after later-generation endografts became available.\nWe retrospectively analyzed non-suprarenal AAA repairs between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2008, performed at a single institution. Patients were stratified by endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) or open repair and the presence or absence of rupture. Thirty-day mortality rates were compared with the Fisher exact test.\nDuring a 13-year period, 721 patients underwent AAA repair, comprising 410 (56.9%) with EVAR and 311 (43.1%) with open repair. A bimodal distribution of EVAR usage was observed, with initial escalation in the 1990s to 70%. A nadir of EVAR occurred in the early 2000s (40%), correlating with more conservative EVAR use after the limitations of first-generation endografts were understood. Between 2005 and 2008, average EVAR use increased to 84%. The overall 30-day mortality rate for the entire cohort, including ruptured AAA, was 3.8%: 2.0% (8 of 410) for EVAR and 6.1% (19 of 311) for open repair (P < .05). Ruptured AAA had a mortality rate of 0% (0 of 8) for EVAR vs 31% (9 of 29) for open (P = .16). Non-ruptured AAA mortality was 2.0% (8 of 402) for EVAR vs 3.6% (10 of 282) for open (P = .23). EVAR and open repair both had reductions in mortality in the latter half of the series, combining to provide a significant decrease in overall mortality to 1.8% for patients treated from 2003 to 2008 compared with 4.9% for 1996 to 2002 (P < .05). Open AAA repair became more complex during the study period. The average rate for juxtarenal open AAA repair was 17.7% (range, 6.5%-34.6%) between 1996 and 2002 compared with 55.6% (range, 29.6%-100%) between 2003 and 2008 (P < .05).\nAAA treatment has undergone a profound and sustained paradigm shift, now averaging 84% of repairs performed with EVAR between 2005 and 2008. Overall mortality from AAA repair, including ruptures, was reduced 64% (from 4.9% to 1.8%) during the 13-year study period. Although EVAR and open repair both had improved mortality in the latter half of the series, the primary driver in reduced mortality for AAA repair has been the shift to EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Studies of infrainguinal lower extremity bypass for critical limb ischemia (CLI) have traditionally emphasized outcomes of patency, limb salvage, and death. Because functional outcomes are equally important, our objectives were to describe the proportion of CLI patients who did not achieve symptomatic improvement 1 year after bypass, despite having patent grafts, and identify preoperative factors associated with this outcome.\nThe prospectively collected Vascular Study Group of Northern New England database was used to identify all patients with elective infrainguinal lower extremity bypass for CLI (2003 to 2007) for whom long-term follow-up data were available. The primary composite study end point was clinical failure at 1 year after bypass, defined as amputation or persistent or worsened ischemic symptoms (rest pain or tissue loss), despite a patent graft. Variables identified on univariate screening (inclusion threshold, P < .20) were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independent predictors.\nLong-term follow-up data were available for 1012 patients who underwent infrainguinal bypasses for CLI, of which 788 (78%) remained patent at 1 year. Of these, 79 (10%) met criteria for the composite end point of clinical failure: 21 (2.7%) for major amputations and 58 (7.4%) for persistent rest pain or tissue loss. In multivariable analysis, significant predictors of clinical failure included dialysis dependence (odds ratio [OR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.84-7.62; P < .001) and preoperative inability to ambulate independently (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.26-3.73; P = .005). A history of coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention was protective (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93; P = .03).\nAfter infrainguinal lower extremity bypass for CLI, 10% of patients with a patent graft did not achieve clinical improvement at 1 year. Preoperative identification of this specific patient subgroup remains challenging. To improve surgical decision making and the overall care of CLI patients, further emphasis needs to be placed on functional outcomes in addition to traditional surgical end points.",

    "abstract": "Several reports suggest unexpectedly high rates of late abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture occur after endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). However, a population-based study examining causes of late death after EVAR vs open surgical repair has not been performed.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing infrarenal AAA repair using information from the Medicare inpatient hospital discharge records (MedPAR files), physician claim files (Part B files, 20% sample), and Medicare Denominator Files for the years 2001 to 2004. Using the Social Security Death Index, we identified all \"late\" deaths, defined as deaths occurring >30 days and after hospital discharge. We used the National Death Index to identify cause of death information; in particular, those deaths that were likely caused by late rupture. We compared causes of late death and survival between EVAR and open repair using Wilcoxon log-rank and rank-sum tests.\nBetween 2001 and 2004, 13,971 patients underwent AAA repair (6119 EVAR, 7852 open repair). After a mean follow-up of 1.6 years in the EVAR cohort and 1.9 years in the open cohort, mortality rates were similar across repair type (15.4% EVAR, 15.9% open repair), with an adjusted odds ratio for death after open repair of 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.07). Of the 2194 documented deaths, 523 occurred before discharge or <or=30 days, and 1671 occurred >30 days and after hospital discharge. Cause of death information for the 1671 late deaths was available from the National Death Index for 1515 (91%). The 15 most common codes for causes of late death were dominated by cardiac disease (atherosclerotic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction) and pulmonary disease (lung cancer, respiratory failure). Causes of late death with specific mention of aneurysm were identified in 37 patients (2.4% of all deaths), but this event was not more common in EVAR or open repair (15 [0.3%] in the EVAR group, 22 [0.3%], in the open repair group; P = .71).\nLate deaths from aneurysm rupture after EVAR or open repair appear to be relatively infrequent and similarly distributed across procedure type. Our results emphasize that the effectiveness of EVAR is comparable to open AAA repair in preventing aneurysm-related death.",

Three techniques were compared: placement of two stents side by side in a \"double-barrel\" (group DB, n = 39); inverted Y stenting through a fenestra (window) created through the side braiding of a stent placed previously across the iliocaval confluence (group iY, n = 38); apposition of a stent as close as possible to a stent previously placed across the iliocaval confluence, leaving a small area unsupported between the stents (group A, n = 38). Patency was assessed with venography and duplex ultrasound imaging. Cumulative patency curves were calculated.\nMedian age was 54 years (range, 14-76 years); female/male ratio was 2.8:1. Obstructions were primary in 141 limbs and postthrombotic in 89, and 29 required recanalization of occlusions. The C(4-6) rate and ratio of limbs with postthrombotic obstruction were significantly higher in group iY vs group DB (49% and 32% [P = .049]; 47% and 28% [P = .022], respectively). The median follow-up was 12 months (range, 1-108 months) in 107 patients (93%). The overall primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates at 4 years were 61%, 92%, and 98%, respectively. The distribution of occluded stent systems (n = 4) and frequency of reinterventions (n = 29) were reflected in the primary and secondary patency rates for groups A, DB, and iY at 4 years (77% and 100%, 73% and 100%, and 41% and 90%, respectively). The frequency of reinterventions was significantly lower in group DB vs groups A and iY (8%, 32%, and 37%, respectively; P < .01).\nChronic iliocaval confluence obstruction is best managed by double-barrel stenting when feasible. The apposition technique requires a high reintervention rate owing to restenosis of the unsupported segment. The secondary stent patency appears to be less in limbs with postthrombotic occlusion. Primary stent patency of nonocclusive obstruction was inferior in group iY regardless of etiology of obstruction. However, inverted Y fenestration is the only choice in delayed contralateral stenting or when the inferior vena cava is extensively involved. There is no optimal solution to the treatment of the iliocaval confluence presently, and the choice of technique is decided by the extent, site, and type of obstruction.",

    "abstract": "Advances in endovascular techniques have provided new options in the treatment of complex infrainguinal occlusive lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of endovascular interventions on TransAtlantic InterSociety (TASC) II D femoropopliteal occlusive disease.\nAll patients undergoing endovascular interventions for femoropopliteal occlusive disease between July 2004 and July 2009 were reviewed. Patient demographics, pre- and postprocedure ankle-brachial indices (ABI) and anatomic factors were analyzed. Outcomes evaluated included primary patency, assisted-patency, secondary patency, predictors of restenosis, and wound healing.\nFive hundred eighty-five limbs were treated during the period reviewed. The study group included 79 TASC D limbs in 74 patients (mean age 76.5 +/- 11.9 years, male sex: 53%). Fifty-six limbs (71%) underwent treatment for critical limb ischemia, including 42 (53%) with tissue loss. Eleven patients (15%) had previous failed bypasses. Preoperative ABIs were unobtainable for 23 patients, while the remaining 56 had a mean baseline ABI of 0.54 +/- 0.28. There was one periprocedural mortality. Five patients (6.3%) had periprocedural complications. Mean increase in ABI postprocedure was 0.49 +/- 0.35. Follow-up was available for 74 limbs at a mean of 10.7 months (range, 1-35). There were 18 mortalities (24.3%) during the follow-up period. No patient required a major amputation during this follow-up period. Twenty-one limbs (26.6%) experienced restenosis and nine limbs (11.4%) experienced occlusion. Twenty-nine limbs underwent reintervention during the follow-up time, including nine which underwent multiple reinterventions. Primary, assisted-primary, and secondary patency rates at 12 and 24 months were 52.2%, 88.4%, 92.6% and 27.5%, 74.2%, and 88.9%, respectively. Predictors of restenosis/occlusion included hypercholesterolemia, the presence of a popliteal artery stent, and patients who were current or former smokers.\nEndovascular interventions for TASC II D lesions can be safely performed with excellent hemodynamic improvement and limb salvage rates. Restenosis is not uncommon in this population, which mandates strict follow-up. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term efficacy of these interventions.",

    "abstract": "Descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease when an approach to the abdominal aorta is undesirable. The major limitation of this technique has resulted from the morbidity rate associated with thoracotomy in a relatively high-risk vascular surgery population. As a minimally invasive procedure, videoendoscopy has been shown to improve the patient postoperative course and comfort in the field of general and thoracic surgery. The same benefits could be expected from a videoendoscopic surgery involving the thoracic aorta. In 2003 we reported the first case of a totally videoendoscopic descending thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery bypass procedure. In this article we report our additional experience with and the modifications we have made to this technique.",

    "abstract": "The use of an aortic patch containing the visceral and renal arteries is a well-established technique during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. However, the retained aortic tissue may later become aneurysmal. We reviewed our TAAA repair experience using a presewn aortic branched graft to eliminate this risk.\nBetween March 2003 and December 2008, 52 patients with Crawford extent II and III TAAAs had surgical repair using a presewn aortic branched graft. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans with intravenous contrast were available for 41 patients (mean angiographic follow-up 2.3 years). The mean age of these 41 patients was 59 +/- 16 years (range, 22-86), and 21 patients were female (51%). The indications for surgery were degenerative aneurysms in 30 patients (73%), type B dissections in 10 patients (24%), and visceral patch aneurysm in 1 patient (2.4%). Twenty-four patients (59%) underwent repair of a Crawford extent II TAAA and 17 patients (41%) had extent III TAAA repair.\nPatency of the branches to the visceral and renal arteries at 1 and 5 years was 100% and 98%, respectively. Of the 148 graft branches, 2 became occluded and 4 developed stenosis (2 patients). One patient required percutaneous stenting of 3 stenosed branches, and 1 patient died after acute occlusion of 2 branches and stenosis of a third. During the follow-up period that extended to 6.3 years, there were 10 late deaths. Six patients required reoperation on the aortic graft or contiguous aorta, but no reoperations have been required on the visceral abdominal aorta or its branches.\nThe use of a presewn aortic branched graft is a safe and suitable option for TAAA repair. With midterm follow-up, this technique seems to eliminate the risk of visceral patch aneurysms and results in favorable durability and patency.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, endovascular repair of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) has become a valid alternative to open repair. This study analyzes the incidence and origin of stent graft fractures after endovascular repair, its impact on patency, and strategies to prevent fractures.\nData of 78 atherosclerotic PAAs in 64 patients were gathered in a prospectively-held database from 1998 to 2009. All x-rays were reviewed to detect stent fractures. Only circumferential fractures were included for analysis; localized strut fractures were excluded. Clinical endpoints were circumferential stent fracture, occlusion, and clinical status of the patient.\nMean follow-up time was 50 months (range, 1-127 months). Fifteen circumferential stent fractures occurred in 13 (16.7%) patients. The majority of stent fractures (93.3%) were associated with the use of multiple stent grafts. At univariate analysis, younger age was identified as the only significant predictor for stent fracture (P = .007). The cumulative stent fracture-free survival was estimated at 78% and 73% at 5- and 10-year follow-up, respectively. The cumulative primary patency rate, defined as time to occlusion, was not different for the fracture group compared with the nonfracture group (P = .284).\nThe incidence of stent fractures after endovascular PAA repair is probably underreported in the literature. Stent graft fractures mainly occur at overlap zones and are associated with younger age of the patient. Fracture of the stent did not significantly influence patency of the stent graft.",

    "abstract": "This study hypothesized that preoperative statin therapy would have a protective effect on patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and that the risk-reduction effect of these agents would result in a reduction in subsequent total hospital costs.\nAll patients who underwent an elective endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) or open AAA repair (OAR) between 2004 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical end points included postoperative days, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, hemorrhage, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound infection), and 30-day mortality. The financial end point was total hospital cost associated with the procedure.\nWe identified 401 patients, consisting of 173 EVAR patients (43%) and 228 OAR (57%). Despite a higher Society for Vascular Surgery risk score, the EVAR statin cohort had significantly reduced postoperative days (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs 2.3 +/- 0.3, P < .05) and hospital length of stay (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 2.8 +/- 0.4, P < .05) compared with the nonstatin EVAR cohort. Postoperative complications (4.4% vs 14.7%, P < .05) and the mortality rate (0.0% vs 5.9%, P < .05) were significantly decreased in the OAR statin cohort compared with the nonstatin OAR cohort and trended to be decreased in the EVAR statin group. Statin therapy translated into a lower total cost per patient of $3,205 for EVAR and $3,792 for OAR (P < .05).\nWith respect to both clinical outcome measures and subsequent resource utilization, statin therapy is associated with a beneficial effect in patients undergoing elective AAA repair. These data suggest that preoperative statin therapy should be an integral part of the risk optimization for patients undergoing AAA repair.",

Despite a higher Society for Vascular Surgery risk score, the EVAR statin cohort had significantly reduced postoperative days (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs 2.3 +/- 0.3, P < .05) and hospital length of stay (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 2.8 +/- 0.4, P < .05) compared with the nonstatin EVAR cohort. Postoperative complications (4.4% vs 14.7%, P < .05) and the mortality rate (0.0% vs 5.9%, P < .05) were significantly decreased in the OAR statin cohort compared with the nonstatin OAR cohort and trended to be decreased in the EVAR statin group. Statin therapy translated into a lower total cost per patient of $3,205 for EVAR and $3,792 for OAR (P < .05).",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of this study was to compare the resting energy expenditure of patients with intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia. A secondary aim was to identify predictors of resting energy expenditure.\nOne hundred patients limited by intermittent claudication and 40 patients with critical limb ischemia participated in this study. Patients were assessed on resting energy expenditure, body composition, ankle brachial index (ABI), and calf blood flow.\nPatients with critical limb ischemia had a lower resting energy expenditure than patients with intermittent claudication (1429 +/- 190 kcal/day vs 1563 +/- 229 kcal/day; P = .004), and higher body fat percentage (34.8 +/- 7.8% vs 31.5 +/- 7.8%; P = .037), higher fat mass (30.0 +/- 9.3 kg vs 26.2 +/- 8.9 kg;P = .016), and lower ABI (0.31 +/- 0.11 vs 0.79 +/- 0.23; P < .001). Resting energy expenditure was predicted by fat free mass (P < .0001), age (P < .0001), ABI (P < .0001), ethnicity (P < .0001), calf blood flow (P = .005), and diabetes (P = .008). Resting energy expenditure remained lower in the patients with critical limb ischemia after adjusting for clinical characteristics plus fat free mass (1473 +/- 27.8 kcal/day [mean +/- SEM] vs 1527 +/- 19.3 kcal/day; P = .031), but it was no longer different between groups after further adjustment for ABI and calf blood flow (1494 +/- 25.2 kcal/day vs 1505 +/- 17.7 kcal/day; P = .269).\nResting energy expenditure is decreased with a progression in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) symptoms from intermittent claudication to critical limb ischemia. Furthermore, patients with critical limb ischemia who are most susceptible for decline in resting energy expenditure are older, African American patients with diabetes. The lower resting energy expenditure of patients with critical limb ischemia, combined with their sedentary lifestyle, suggests that they are at high risk for long-term positive energy balance and weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysmal involvement of the iliac bifurcation increases the level of difficulty during surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, potentially increasing the risk of early postoperative complications. Three previous randomized trials comparing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open repair (OR) for AAAs showed that EVAR is associated with a lower early mortality rate. However, whether these results are valid for AAA involving the iliac bifurcation (AAAIB) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate early and late results after OR and EVAR for patients with AAA involving the iliac bifurcation.\nOf 1116 patients treated for elective AAA repair between January 1998 and January 2008, 131 presented with AAAIB as detected by computed tomography (CT) scan. Sixty-eight patients were treated by EVAR and 63 by OR. Clinical and anatomic data, operative intervention, and outcomes were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. The median duration of follow-up was 38 months for both groups.\nPatients in the EVAR group (72 +/- 10 years) were older than those in the OR group (64 +/- 8 years; P < .0001), but there were no differences in cardiac, renal, or pulmonary comorbidities between the two groups. Inhospital mortality rates were 2.9% vs 6.3% for EVAR and OR groups, respectively (P = .43). Systemic postoperative complications occurred in 7.4% vs 9.5% (P = .76) and postoperative colonic ischemia in 0% vs 6.3% (P = .051) of patients with EVAR and OR, respectively. Survival rates by Kaplan-Meier analysis were 91 +/- 7% for patients with EVAR and 90 +/- 8% for patients with OR at 2 years, and 61% +/- 15 for EVAR and 79% +/- 13 for OR at 5 years. All-cause reoperation rates were 25% with EVAR and 22% with OR (P = .83). Patients with EVAR were more likely to develop buttock claudication (33.3% vs 3.6%; P < .0001), whereas patients with OR were more prone to develop abdominal wall complications (19.6% vs 0%; P < .001).\nIn this series, the postoperative mortality and systemic complication rates after either EVAR or OR for AAAIB were not statistically different. In the OR group, there were more abdominal wall complications and a trend toward a higher rate of colonic ischemia. In the EVAR group, buttock claudication was more frequent.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is one of the most accepted treatment options for varicose veins. In previous studies conducted with a laser at 810 to 1320 nm, paresthesia, pain, and ecchymosis were common adverse effects. We hypothesized that a lower linear endovenous energy density (LEED), as used with 1470-nm diode laser fibers, would lead to a reduction in adverse events.\nWe conducted a prospective, nonrandomized observational cohort study of 312 consecutively treated lower limbs legs in 286 patients. Of these, a bare laser fiber (ELVeS-plus kit) was used to treat 168 legs in 150 patients (group 1), and a radial fiber (ELVeS-radial kit) was used in 144 legs in 136 patients (group 2). Laser treatment was performed in the great saphenous vein. Follow-up for all patients was 3 months. The primary end point was the occurrence of ecchymosis and bruising. This was correlated to the reduced LEED needed with the 1470-nm diode laser.\nLaser fiber (odds ratio [OR], 22.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.2-24.5) and body mass index (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.55) were identified as independent parameters for LEED. In group 2 compared with group 1, LEED in the great saphenous vein could be reduced from 79.4 +/- 9.1 to 57.4 +/- 10 J/cm (P < .0001). LEED was an independent parameter for skin bleeding (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.017-1.058). Ecchymosis and bruising were significantly less frequent in group 2 than in group 1 (P < .0001). The need for analgesia was low, with 103.08 +/- 15.34 mg diclofenac-sodium in group 1 vs 82.08 +/- 18.86 mg in group 2 (P < .04). Occlusion with elimination of reflux was achieved in 100% of group 1 and group 2 (P < 1). No recanalization occurred at follow-up.\nEndovenous laser treatment of varicose veins in the great saphenous vein with the 1470-nm diode laser is safe and highly effective. The lower energy level needed using the radial laser fiber significantly minimized adverse effects compared with the bare laser fiber.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis access by autogenous arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) is generally recommended due to lower mortality, morbidity, and cost vs graft and catheter use. Many dialysis patients lack the common superficial veins used for standard AVF options and require transposition of a deep vein for autogenous dialysis access through a long open incision (open/AVF-T). These operations may require prolonged time for healing, thus extending catheter-based dialysis. We report our experience with minimally invasive techniques for creating AVF-Ts using an endoscopic procedure (endo/AVF-T).\nWe reviewed our vascular access database of consecutive access operations to identify consecutive patients with endo/AVF-Ts. For comparison, we also reviewed the immediate preceding traditional open/AVF-T operations that we previously reported. We evaluated demographics, time to access use, and primary, assisted, and cumulative patency.\nWe identified 100 consecutive endo/AVF-T operations attempted, and 98 were technically successful. The analysis excluded two conversions to successful open/AVF-T. The mean age of the 98 patients in the endo/AVF-T study group was 60 years (range, 22-94 years), 59 (60.2%) were women, 48 (49.0%) were diabetic, 20 (20.4%) were obese, and 52 (53.1%) had had previous access surgery. Mean time to initial use of the access for endo/AVF-Ts was 6 weeks for primary and 12 weeks for staged transpositions. Mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 1-30 months). The 12- and 24-month cumulative patencies were 95.5% and 88.6%. The 78 traditional open/AVF-T operations from our previous report were reviewed for comparison. The mean age was 62 years (range, 18-83 years), 57 (73.1%) were women, 44 (56.4%) were diabetic, 15 (19.2%) were obese, and 46 (59.0%) had previous access surgery. Mean time to initial use of the access for open/AVF-Ts was 8 weeks for primary and 16 weeks for staged operations. Mean follow-up was 18 months (range, 3-48 months). The 12- and 24-month cumulative patencies were 96.0 and 88.9%. No grafts were used in any patient during the study period.\nTime to access use was less with endoscopic AVF-T (P < .01) for both primary and staged operations. Primary, assisted, and cumulative patency rates were the same for open and technically successful endoscopic transpositions. Endoscopic AVF-Ts offer a viable alternative to open AVF-Ts.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment for varicose recurrence (STVR) involves removing all sources of reflux from the deep venous network to the superficial venous network. STVR is usually more complex and aggressive than first-line treatment by stripping, particularly for redo surgery at the groin (RSG). This retrospective study compared traditional STVR and a less aggressive surgical approach focusing on treatment of the varicose reservoir and avoiding RSG if possible.\nTwo successive periods of STVR after great saphenous vein stripping were compared: traditional STVR (T1) and STVR focusing on the varicose reservoir (T2). We reviewed postoperative complications and studied the hemodynamic and clinical results.\nDuring T1 and T2, we operated 473 legs in 288 patients (236 women, 52 men) to treat varicose recurrence after great saphenous vein stripping. Mean age was 60.83 years (range, 28-88 years). We operated on 137 patients during T1 and 151 during T2. Patients had similar demographic data, CEAP classification, and Venous Disability Score. Inguinal reflux occurred in 73.9% of T1 patients and in 74.4% of T2 patients. We performed RSG in 66.0% of T1 patients and in 2.2% of T2 patients (P < .05). We did not use echo-guided sclerotherapy in addition to primary STVR. Tumescent local anesthesia was used in 96.2% of STVR in T2 vs 4.0% in T1 (P < .05), and 95.3% of T2 procedures were outpatient vs 13.7% of T1 (P < .05). Outcomes of limbs presenting an inguinal reflux treated with RSG during T1 (group 1) and without RSG during T2 (group 2) were compared. Postoperative complications occurred in 6.7% in group 1 vs 0.5% in group 2 (P < .05), with inguinal complications predominating. The mean cost of the procedure per limb was euro1,195.88 in group 1 vs euro863.08 in group 2 (P < .0001). After 3 years of follow-up, Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis showed group 1 and 2 patients had similar rates of freedom from inguinal reflux (90.8% vs 92.9% survival rate) and from varicose repeat-recurrence (90.8% vs 91.9% survival rate). Group 1 had better results for the Venous Disability Score (0.38 vs 0.58, P = .02) and cosmetic improvement (94.2% vs 84.2%; P = .00032).\nSTVR focusing on the varicose reservoir and avoiding RSG led to a minimally invasive procedure and a reduction in postoperative complications, with good medium-term clinical and hemodynamic results, particularly for symptoms improvement and cosmetic appearance, with a lower cost vs traditional STVR with RSG.",

    "abstract": "This study delineated correlations between ferritin, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in a cohort of 100 cancer-free patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) participating in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study #410, the Iron (Fe) and Atherosclerosis Study (FeAST). FeAST, a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial, tested the hypothesis that reduction of iron stores using phlebotomy would influence clinical outcomes in 1227 PAD patients randomized to iron reduction or control groups. The effects of statin administration were also examined in the Sierra Nevada Health Care (SNHC) cohort by measuring serum ferritin levels at entry and during the 6-year study period. No difference was documented between treatment groups in all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of death plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. Iron reduction in the main study caused a significant age-related improvement in cardiovascular disease outcomes, new cancer diagnoses, and cancer-specific death.\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-alpha receptors 1 and 2, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at entry and at 6-month intervals for 6 years. Average levels of ferritin and lipids at entry and at the end of the study were compared. The clinical course and ferritin levels of 23 participants who died during the study were reviewed.\nAt entry, mean age of entry was 67 +/- 9 years for the SNHCS cohort, comparable to FeAST and clinical and laboratory parameters were equivalent in substudy participants randomized to iron reduction (n = 51) or control (n = 49). At baseline, 53 participants on statins had slightly lower mean entry-level ferritin values (114.06 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 93.43-134.69) vs the 47 off statins (127.62 ng/mL; 95% CI, 103.21-152.02). Longitudinal analysis of follow-up data, after adjusting for the phlebotomy treatment effect, showed that statin use was associated with significantly lower ferritin levels (-29.78 ng/mL; Cohen effect size, -0.47 [t(df, 134) = 2.33, P = .02]). Mean follow-up average ferritin levels were higher in 23 participants who died (132.5 ng/mL; 95% CI, 79.36-185.66) vs 77 survivors (83.6 ng/mL; 95% CI, 70.34-96.90; Wilcoxon P = .05).

Ferritin levels correlated (Pearson) with average IL-6 levels (r = 0.1845; P = .002) and hsCRP levels (r = .1175; P = .04) during the study.\nThese data demonstrate statistical correlations between levels of ferritin, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in this subset of patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "The national burden of venous disease and use of ultrasound (US) in the outpatient and emergency department (ED) settings has not been well described. The objective of this study is to describe venous disease in the outpatient and ED settings nationally as well as to characterize the use of US for diagnosis of venous disease, including phlebitis.\nData from the 1997 to 2006 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) were compiled, and complex sampling methods were used to describe the number of outpatient and ED visits for adults given a diagnosis of venous disease or phlebitis by ICD-9 coding. Logistic regression analysis with calculated odds ratios are used to examined patient visit characteristics and use of US.\nDuring the 10 years studied, an office or ED visit for venous disease occurred over 46 million times, for an average of 4.6 million visits per year, with this rate increasing from 4.03 million to 5.71 million per year (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.01). The majority of these patients were seen by specialists, such as surgeons or cardiologists, but a significant number were also seen by primary care providers (PCP). There were 2 million office visits (PCP and specialists) on average per year with no significant increase. There were approximately 236,000 ED visits for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on average per year, which showed a small increase (OR 1.01, CI 1.00-1.01). Visits for DVT and phlebitis were as likely to be seen by PCPs as ED physicians. Non-DVT venous disease is much more likely to be seen by a surgeon (OR 4.88, CI 3.53-6.74) than a PCP. DVT is much less likely to be diagnosed by a specialist (OR 0.27, CI 0.18-0.29) than a PCP. Insurance status and geographic region were not associated with DVT or non-DVT venous disease diagnosis.\nNationally, a significant and growing number of patients with venous disease are being seen in the outpatient setting by PCPs and specialists. A significant number of patients with DVT are being seen in the outpatient setting, but without a trend away from care in the ED over the 10-year study period. Additionally, the majority of patients with DVT diagnosis do not seem to be getting ultrasounds at the same visit. Many of these patients are being seen by PCPs who may require additional training and infrastructure for appropriate patient care.",

    "abstract": "Venous thoracic outlet syndrome progressing to the point of axilosubclavian vein thrombosis, variously referred to as Paget-Schroetter syndrome or effort thrombosis, is a classic example of an entity which if treated correctly has minimal long-term sequelae but if ignored is associated with significant long-term morbidity. The subclavian vein is highly vulnerable to injury as it passes by the junction of the first rib and clavicle in the anterior-most part of the thoracic outlet. In addition to extrinsic compression, repetitive forces in this area frequently lead to fixed intrinsic damage and extrinsic scar tissue formation. Once primary thrombosis is recognized, catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is usually successful if initiated within ten to 14 days of clot formation, but often unmasks an underlying lesion. The vast majority of investigators believe that decompression of the venous thoracic outlet, usually by means of first rib excision, partial anterior scalenectomy, resection of the costoclavicular ligament, and thorough external venolysis, is necessary, although opinion is less uniform as to the need for and method of treatment of the venous lesion itself. Using this algorithm, long-term success rates of 95 to 100% have been reported by many investigators. This review, in addition to discussing the overall treatment algorithm in more detail, attempts to point out controversies that still exist and research directions, both clinical and basic, that need to be pursued. Prospective randomized trials addressing this entity are surprisingly lacking, and although there is consensus based on experience, it may be necessary to step back and rigorously explore several aspects of this entity.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to define the outcomes of treating aortic aneurysms involving the arch vessels with a hybrid approach using extra-anatomic reconstruction and endovascular repair with nonfenestrated stents.\nA single-center review was done of arch aneurysm endovascular repairs during an 8-year period. Data were collected for patient demographics and aneurysm pathology. Any revascularization procedures performed were analyzed to detect differences between groups and through fitting a logistic regression model. The outcome measures were postoperative death, stroke, and paraplegia.\nBetween 2001 and 2009, 78 patients (65% men; mean age, 65 years) underwent endovascular repair of aortic arch aneurysms. Coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) was necessary in all patients to access an adequate proximal landing zone. An Ishimaru zone 0 proximal landing zone was present in 9 patients, 17 had zone 1, and 52 had zone 2. Fifty patients (64%) underwent elective endografting with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%, and 28 patients (36%) underwent emergency procedures with a mortality rate of 14.3%. The LSA was revascularized in 31 elective (62%) and 4 emergency patients (14%). LSA revascularization was associated with significantly better outcomes for the combined measure of death, stroke, and paraplegia (odds ratio [OR], 15.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-142; P = .012). Patients with an atherosclerotic aneurysm had worse outcomes than those with aortic dissection (OR, 5.52; 95% CI 1.26-24.4; P = .024), with dissections having preponderance toward emergency procedures (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.12-7.58; P = .035).\nAneurysms involving the aortic arch vessels can be effectively treated by staged endovascular-surgical hybrid procedures with good outcomes that can be further improved through prior revascularization of the LSA.",

Approximately 1 year after the cholecystectomy, liver transaminases were elevated, and she complained of recurrent \"crampy\" right upper quadrant pain that radiated posteriorly to her back. Imaging studies demonstrated an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery at the porta hepatis, with possible infiltration into the parenchyma between the right and left lobes of the liver. Selective celiac arteriography showed a 90% stenosis of the right hepatic artery with a large pseudoaneurysm arising from the stenotic segment. This was treated with a 3- x 16-mm stent graft (Jostent; Abbott Vascular, Temecula, Calif) with good result. The completion arteriogram showed wide patency of the stent graft with total exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm. Follow-up serial duplex scans up to 40 months after the procedure showed no evidence of residual pseudoaneurysm and wide patency of the stent graft, with no evidence of focal velocity changes in the right hepatic artery. The patient continues to do well clinically.",

    "abstract": "The burden of tobacco dependence can be measured in premature deaths due to accelerated atherosclerotic disease and cancer, and economic costs of lost productivity and intensified medical care. Smoking cessation efforts have benefited from continued pharmacologic developments, increased public awareness of stop-smoking programs, aggressive counter-campaigns to illustrate the toll of cigarette smoking, and recognition of the many primary and secondary effects of smoking exposure on the general public. Vascular surgeons and interventionalists, as well as vascular medicine specialists, are uniquely positioned to engage and educate the patient to promote cessation, monitor for continued abstinence, and assist in efforts to avoid relapses. This article reviews the effects of tobacco dependence on peripheral arterial disease, perioperative considerations in smokers, as well as common clinical interventions such as counseling and pharmacotherapy to encourage tobacco cessation.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment of aortic coarctation has increased life expectancy and reduced mortality. Unfortunately, the average lifespan after repair remains only 35 to 50 years, and significant morbidity persists as a result of aneurysm formation, hypertension, accelerated coronary disease, and stroke. Follow-up studies have revealed restenosis rates of 30% and persistent hypertension at rest and during exercise, sometimes with compromised cardiac function. The less invasive nature of nonsurgical repair using transcatheter therapies has led to balloon angioplasty and, recently, stent implantation as an emerging concept for the treatment of aortic coarctation. This review focuses on advances in the management, current indication, and techniques of interventional repair in aortic coarctation.",

    "abstract": "New training paradigms in vascular surgery necessitate medical student interest in vascular disease. We examined the effects of incorporation of a vascular disease educational program during the second year of the medical school curriculum on student acquisition of knowledge and interest in the treatment of vascular disease.\nWe developed and administered a new educational program on vascular disease and delivered the program to all second-year medical students. The new program encompassed 9 didactic hours, including 7 traditional lecture hours and 2 hours of problem-based learning. After completing the program, students were surveyed regarding vascular disease-specific knowledge, interest in treating vascular disease, and career choices. Third-year students who were not exposed to the program were surveyed as a control group. We recorded the voluntary student enrollment in the vascular and endovascular surgery rotation during the following academic year. Voluntary enrollment of the students exposed to the vascular disease education program was compared with enrollment for the previous 8 years.\nBefore the introduction of the new educational program, 946 total lecture hours were delivered to first- and second-year medical students, comprising 490 hours (52%) given by nonsurgeon physicians, 445 (47%) by nonphysicians, and 11 (1%) by surgeons. Survey response rate was 93% (112 of 121) for second-year students and 95% (39 of 41) for third-year students. After the vascular disease program, second-year students answered 7.1 +/- 1.4 of 9 vascular disease questions correctly, whereas unexposed third-year students answered 7.2 +/- 1.7 questions correctly (P = .96). Most second-year medical students described a \"somewhat\" or \"much greater\" interest in the medical (63%), procedural (59%), and overall (63%) management of vascular disease after exposure to the program. Most also had a \"somewhat\" or \"much greater\" interest in a vascular medicine (64%) or vascular and endovascular surgery (60%) rotation. Enrollment in the vascular surgery third-year clerkship increased significantly to a mean of 3.0 students/month from 1.16 students/month in the prior year (P = .0032, postintervention year vs 8 prior years).\nA vascular disease educational program administered to second-year medical students increases interest in vascular disease and interest in further training. The increased interest translates to greater student enrollment in the vascular surgery clerkship in the subsequent academic year.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that prior endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) confers protective effects in the setting of ruptured AAA (rAAA). This study was conducted to compare outcomes of rAAA repairs in patients with and without prior EVAR.\nA retrospective review identified 18 patients with (group 1) and 233 patients without (group 2) antecedent EVAR who presented with rAAA from January 2001 to December 2008. Patient characteristics and perioperative variables were noted and the outcomes were compared. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors contributing to morbidity and mortality and Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate late survival rates.\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups. Mean age was 78 years in group 1 and 74.8 years in group 2 (P=.17). Men comprised 83.3% of patients in group 1 and 77.3% in group 2 (P=.77). Hemodynamic instability at rAAA was noted with similar frequency between groups, 55.6% vs 52.6%, respectively (P=.99). Mean time from EVAR to rAAA was 4.0 years and from last follow-up computed tomography (CT) 1.2 years. The devices involved were Ancure (Guidant, Menlo Park, Calif) (9), AneuRx (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) (5), Zenith (Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, Ind) (3), and Excluder (W.L Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) (1). Mean preoperative AAA size was 6.4 cm in group 1. All but 1 patient had an endoleak at the time of rupture. Of 14 patients with CT follow-up, only 3 patients had a known increase in size (\u22655 mm) and only 3 were known to have an endoleak. Fifteen patients were treated by a single intervention, whereas 3 patients underwent multiple procedures. In group 2, open repair was performed in 218 patients and EVAR in 15. Morbidity (66.7% vs 56.7%) and in-hospital mortality (38.9% vs 36.9%) were nearly identical between groups. One-year survival rates (27.8% vs 48.2%; P=.15) were also similar. The mortality rates for EVAR for primary rAAA was 20% as compared to 38.1% for open repair for rAAAs (P=.27).\nrAAA remains a lethal problem in patients with and without prior EVAR alike. An existing endograft provides neither acute nor 1-year survival benefits after rAAA repairs. Prediction of patients at risk for rupture post-EVAR is difficult, as only a minority of patients had a known prior endoleak or sac enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Despite overall improvement, there is still a gender-related disparity in the outcomes of lower extremities peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We analyzed sex-related variability among factors that are known to influence outcomes.\nData on PAD inpatient hospitalizations from New York, New Jersey, and Florida state hospital discharge databases (1998-2007) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.\nOf the 372,692 surgical hospitalizations identified, 162,730 (43.66%) involved women. Men and women undergoing vascular procedures differed in that more men smoked (18% vs 14%; P<.0001), and more men had coronary artery disease (40% vs 33%; P<.0001). Women were more likely to be obese (11.86% vs 4.89%; P<.0001), black (18.81% vs 12.66%; P<.0001), older, and have critical limb ischemia (CLI) (39.41% vs 37.67%; P<.0001). They had higher mortality (5.26% vs 4.21%; P<.0001) and complication rates, especially bleeding (10.62 % vs 8.19%; P<.0001) and infection (3.23% vs 2.88%; P<.0001). Mortality rates after endovascular procedures were lower and showed marginal difference between genders (2.87% vs 2.11%; P<.0001). The difference was more pronounced after open revascularizations (5.05% for women vs 4.00% for men; P<.0001) and amputations (9.82% for women vs 8.82% for men; P<.0001). Bleeding differences between men and women were greatest when both open and endovascular procedures were done during the same hospitalizations and lowest after major amputations. Similar to bleeding, transgender differences in postoperative infections were more pronounced after combination of open and endovascular procedures. Using a multivariable model, female gender remained a predictor of perioperative mortality, infection, and bleeding after vascular intervention (odds ratios 1.15, 1.21, and 1.32, respectively). Female gender negatively influenced the mortality of patients with cerebrovascular and coronary disease and those of black race even after adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors. Gender effect on mortality dissipated in octogenarians and patients with claudication.\nFemale gender continues to be an important risk factor that negatively influences the outcomes of vascular interventions; however, these effects vary between different high-risk groups and procedures. Gender effect on mortality dissipates in elderly patients. Prompt recognition of the associations between gender and various risk factors of cardiovascular disease and aggressive modification of these risk factors in female patients may improve gender-related disparity in the outcomes of vascular disease.",

More advanced mechanical models can be used and may yield additional information, such as transmural stress distributions. The question then arises of how refined models need to be to provide clinicians with practical help.\nTwo sets of finite element models were used. The relative roles of diameter, material stiffness, longitudinal stretch, blood pressure, wall thickness, and vessel curvature were explored using simplified aortic models for comparison with the Laplace law. The influences of the material properties nonlinearity and residual stress on the transmural stress distribution were investigated using an advanced aortic model including recent experimental findings in older humans.\nThe Laplace law was confirmed as one effective, basic tool to assess the average wall stress in the aortic wall, both in the circumferential and longitudinal directions. However, the simplified models were sufficient to show that, as already reported in the literature, longitudinal stretch and vessel curvature have potentially equally strong or even stronger contributions to wall stress than the parameters included in the Laplace law. When the advanced model was used, and residual stress induced by large opening angles such as found in older subjects was introduced, the transmural stress gradient was found inverted compared with expectations, with the largest stresses now toward the adventitia. The results suggested that the intima may be increasingly shielded from higher stresses as one gets older, which might be protective against the initiation of dissection tears in the thoracic aorta.\nBiomechanical analysis of the aorta may be refined by using increasingly detailed computational models. Simplified models can readily improve on the Laplace law in the assessment of aortic wall stress, and as such, may already contribute to better risk stratification of aortic disease. Advanced models may also enhance our understanding of the mechanistic aspects in the pathogenesis of aortic disease. However, their applicability in a patient-specific context may be limited by the large number of input data they require, some of which might stay out of the clinicians' reach.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed the clinical and morphologic outcomes of endovascular treatment of ruptured isolated iliac artery aneurysms (RIIAA) at midterm follow-up.\nEleven patients with RIIAA (1 woman, 10 men; mean age, 73 years; mean IIAA diameter, 69.1 mm) were identified in a single-center database of patients who underwent endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair between April 2001 and December 2009. Devices inserted included 9 leg endografts in 7 patients (Excluder, n=7; Zenith, n=2), 3 bifurcated stent grafts in 3 patients (Excluder), and 1 aortouniiliac stent graft in 1 patient (Zenith). Endovascular occlusion of the internal iliac artery or its branches was performed in all cases by coils (n=10) or Amplatzer occluder plug (n=1). Immediately after endovascular aneurysm exclusion, a computed tomography (CT) angiography was obtained in nine patients. Except for this adjunct postimplantation CT scanning, the imaging follow-up was the same as for nonruptured aortoiliac aneurysms at 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter.\nMean delay from hospital admission to intervention was 78.5 minutes. Mean intervention time was 150 minutes. The assisted primary technical success rate was 100%. Median lengths of stay were 2 days in the intensive care unit and 13 days in the hospital. Abdominal compartment syndrome developed in three patients who received open abdomen treatment. The 30-day mortality was 18%. The mean follow-up was 23 months (range, 0-69 months). There were no late deaths during the follow-up. There was no need for late surgical conversion. Aneurysm sac shrinkage (defined as >5 mm) was recorded in five patients, whereas the sac diameter remained stable in four. There was no patient with aneurysm sac growth. Additional stent graft insertion as the only secondary intervention for a type Ib leak was performed. Type II endoleaks (primary and secondary) were found in 36% and secondary Ib in 9% of the patients.\nEmergency stent grafting of RIIAA is feasible and safe with good midterm outcome.",

    "abstract": "Supraceliac aortic clamping in major vascular procedures promotes splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury that may induce endothelial dysfunction, widespread inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. We tested the hypothesis that local or remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) may be protective against injury after supraceliac aortic clamping through the modulation of mesenteric leukocyte-endothelial interactions, as evaluated with intravital microscopy and expression of adhesion molecules.\nFifty-six male Wistar rats (weight, 190 to 250 g), were divided into four groups of 14 rats each: control-sham surgery without aortic occlusion; I/R through supraceliac aortic occlusion for 20 minutes, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion; local IPC through supraceliac aortic occlusion for two cycles of 5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reperfusion, followed by the same protocol of the IR group; remote IPC through infrarenal aortic occlusion for two cycles of 10 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion, followed by the same protocol of the IR group. Seven animals per group were used to evaluate in vivo leukocyte-endothelial interactions in postcapillary venules with intravital microscopy and another seven animals per group were used to collect mesentery samples for immunohistochemistry demonstration of adhesion molecules expression.\nSupraceliac aortic occlusion increased the number of rolling leukocytes with slower velocities and increased the number of adherent leukocytes to the venular surface and leukocyte migration to the interstitium. The expression of P-selectin, E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was also increased significantly after I/R. Local or remote IPC reduced the leukocyte recruitment in vivo and normalized the expression of adhesion molecules.\nLocal or remote IPC reduces endothelial dysfunction on mesenteric microcirculation caused by I/R injury after supraceliac aortic clamping.",

    "abstract": "The traditional apprenticeship model introduced by Halsted of \"learning by doing\" may just not be valid in the modern practice of vascular surgery. The model is often criticized for being somewhat unstructured because a resident's experience is based on what comes through the \"door.\" In an attempt to promote uniformity of training, multiple national organizations are currently delineating standard curricula for each trainee to govern the knowledge and cases required in a vascular residency. However, the outcomes are anything but uniform. This means that we graduate vascular specialists with a surprisingly wide spectrum of abilities. Use of simulation may benefit trainees in attaining a level of technical expertise that will benefit themselves and their patients. Furthermore, there is likely a need to establish a simulation-based certification process for graduating trainees to further ascertain minimum technical abilities.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of warfarin pre-treatment in the prevention of PE after PTBA in patients with large inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus.\nFrom October 2002 to December 2009, 16 patients with symptomatic membranous or segmental IVC occlusion and large thrombus were treated with warfarin before PTBA. Eleven patients were men and 5 were women. The median age was 36 years, ranging from 21 to 52 years. The median duration of warfarin treatment before PTBA was 7 months, ranging from 3 to 12 months. Fourteen patients had membranous IVC occlusion and 2 had segmental occlusion. All 16 patients had significant thrombi underneath the obstructive lesions. PE diagnosis was based on clinical presentation and pulmonary computerized tomographic angiogram, if indicated.\nIn 14 of 16 patients, IVC thrombus was completely or near-completely resolved based on follow-up cavogram and PTBA was performed. In the other 2 patients, residual thrombus was demonstrated by cavogram at 12 months. PTBA and stent placement were carried out. IVC patency in the 16 patients was confirmed by completion cavogram. No major bleeding complication during warfarin pre-treatment aimed to keep international normalized ratio (INR) 2 to 3. There was no clinically significant PE or death in this group during follow-up, ranging from 6 to 40 months (median 21 months).\nSpontaneous fibrinolysis of IVC thrombus occurs within 1 year in the majority of the patients treated with warfarin.

Endovascular repair has become an alternative for patients with ruptured AAA or other acute disease complications. The present study, however, attempted to use a common stent graft with the fenestration technique, rather than a customized one, in an emergency situation, to treat a giant pararenal AAA complicated by upper digestive tract obstruction, and assessed the results.\nA patient with a pararenal AAA was admitted emergently, with complications of upper digestive tract obstruction, including a tumor-like dilated segment of the abdominal aorta, 0.5-cm inferior to the ostia of the bilateral renal arteries, with a maximum diameter of 10.1 cm and a length of 18.5 cm. The patient underwent endovascular repair with a fenestrated endovascular stent graft to open the bilateral renal arteries 1 week later in an emergency situation.\nNo stenosis occurred at the openings of bilateral renal artery as a result of the stent, and the AAA was completely occluded. The patient experienced greatly ameliorated abdominal pain and upper digestive tract obstruction. At the 1-year follow-up examination, no exceptional symptoms were observed.\nThese results showed that for patients with a pararenal AAA who are unfit for open repair, or for those who cannot wait longer than 6 weeks for a customized fenestrated stent graft to be made, emergency field fenestration is feasible and successful, based on selection of the proper patient and accurate intraoperative localization.",

Invasive therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and/or mechanical thrombectomy with or without angioplasty and stenting and in some cases open operative thrombectomy improves venous patency, venous valve function, and quality of life in patients with acute iliofemoral DVT. What is the current frequency of acute iliofemoral DVT and how aggressively is it being treated? We hypothesize that the 10-year period frequency of iliofemoral DVT among acute DVT cases is greater than previously reported. Further, we hypothesize that thrombus removal to treat acute iliofemoral DVT is little utilized in current practice.\nIndiana University (IU) vascular laboratory records from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2008 were searched by CPT code for venous Doppler ultrasound study (n=7240). A random sample based on the IU medical record number of lower extremity Doppler studies was then selected (n=1020) for retrospective chart review. Corresponding clinical information was gathered from the patients' electronic medical record.\nAcute DVT occurred in 6.8%, and chronic DVT in 8.8% of patients studied (25.7% inpatient, 61.7% female; median age, 56.0 years [range, 4-91 years, 1.1% less than 16 years]). History of previous DVT (33.3%) and cancer (30.4%) were the most common risk factors in patients with acute DVT. Iliofemoral DVT defined as having an iliac or common femoral vein component was identified in 49.3% of acute DVT and in 36.0% of chronic DVT. CDT was utilized in 14.3% and mechanical thrombectomy in 4.8% of acute iliofemoral DVT, and was never used with distal DVT. Warfarin anticoagulation+unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin overlap was the most common treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT (100.0%). In 2008, the referral base of our laboratory increased significantly. Acute DVT occurred significantly less often during the 1-year period 2008 (5.3%) than the 10-year period 1998-2007 (7.6%), but iliofemoral+common femoral DVT as a component of acute DVT did not differ significantly.\nIliofemoral DVT may be more frequent than previously reported and represents a significant portion of acute DVT. Current recommendations of acute thrombus removal for the treatment of iliofemoral DVT is underutilized suggesting that perhaps greater education of clinicians and patients regarding invasive therapy for iliofemoral DVT is required.",

    "abstract": "Current long-term surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at scheduled, lifelong intervals. The cancer and nephrotoxicity risks of interval CT scanning and prolonged radiation exposure are concerning. We sought to determine if surveillance CT angiography (CTA) can be safely reduced.\nFrom July 2000 to November 2007, 345 patients were enrolled in U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials of the Powerlink System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif). An independent core laboratory analyzed 1519 post-EVAR CT scans (N=1519) to 5 years to evaluate aneurysm size, migration, presence of endoleak, and evidence of graft obstruction. Analyses were conducted to determine the value of the initial CTA scan in predicting future secondary procedures in enrolled patients.\nAt any time during follow-up, CTA identified endoleak in 123 patients (36%), with 95% of endoleaks being type II. In addition, 49 patients underwent 72 secondary procedures at a mean of 22\u00b121 months (range, 2-2007 days) after initial EVAR. These were based on clinical identification of limb ischemia in 13 interventions (18%) or core laboratory identification of abnormal CT finding in 58 interventions (81%). Of the 58 core laboratory identified findings, the inciting abnormality was present on the initial postoperative scan in 49 (84%). Of the remaining nine CT-driven procedures, three (5.2%) were due to late sac expansion attributed to type II endoleak (n=2) or endotension (n=1); two (3.4%) were for prophylactic reasons in the absence of endoleak; and four (6.8%) were in patients with type II endoleak not observed by the core laboratory and without sac expansion. The negative predictive value of the initial postoperative CTA for the need for a secondary procedure is therefore 96.4%, which can be improved to 97.6% with duplex ultrasound surveillance to detect sac expansion. Thus, a negative initial postoperative CTA is highly predictive of long-term freedom from secondary intervention.\nAmong enrolled patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR, most abnormalities that result in a secondary procedure are detected on the initial postoperative CTA or present with clinical symptoms. Long-term surveillance CTA may therefore be replaced by duplex ultrasound imaging if the initial postoperative CTA shows no abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have investigated the predictive value of clinical and morphologic parameters for distal embolization during carotid interventions. The composition of the atherosclerotic plaque, using virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) imaging obtained with an IVUS catheter that is advanced through the lesion after a filter has been placed distally, has not been evaluated as a marker for cerebral embolization. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between atherosclerotic plaque composition determined with VH-IVUS and the occurrence of cerebral embolization after carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nDuring a 10-month period, 24 patients undergoing CAS procedures using a filter device for embolic protection were prospectively evaluated. All patients underwent VH-IVUS exams at the time of the intervention, transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring during CAS, and pre- and 24-hour postprocedural diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) exams. Using VH-IVUS, plaque components were characterized as fibrotic, fibrofatty, dense calcium, and necrotic core. The frequency of Doppler-detected microembolic signals (MES) during CAS and the incidence and location of acute postprocedural embolic lesions detected with DW-MRI were assessed to determine cerebral embolization. Univariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the association between plaque composition and frequency of cerebral embolization.\nNo periprocedural transient ischemic attacks, strokes, or deaths occurred within 30 days. Seventeen patients (71%) demonstrated new acute cerebral emboli in DW-MRI. Of these, all revealed ipsilateral lesions and 12 (50%) had contralateral lesions. For the entire study group, the median number of ipsilateral DW-MRI lesions was 1 (range, 0 to 3), and TCD MES counts were 227 (interquartile range, 143-315). Volumetric VH-IVUS analysis revealed that there was a trend for larger median dense calcium volume in patients with ipsilateral subclinical cerebral embolism detected with DW-MRI (33.2\u00b124.5 mm3 vs 11.4\u00b16.1 mm3; P=.08). Scatter plots of plaque components revealed statistically significant correlation between fibrofatty plaque volume (Spearman r=0.49; P=.016) and number of new ipsilateral lesions in DW-MRI. Degree of cerebral embolization during CAS measured with TCD correlated with plaque burden, necrotic core, fibrofatty, and fibrous volumes.\nPlaque composition, as determined by VH-IVUS, only weakly correlates with the degree of cerebral embolization after carotid stenting. Specifically, there is a trend for larger dense calcium volume in patients with distal embolization. Of note, the proportion of necrotic core, which has traditionally been considered the main component of a vulnerable or unstable plaque, is not definitely associated with subclinical cerebral embolization after CAS when a filter device for embolic protection is used. The role of VH-IVUS in evaluating plaque composition during CAS remains unestablished and warrants further investigation.",

Limited accessibility of the distal internal carotid artery has resulted in the development of various operative techniques.

We use a mouthpiece made by the dentist to stabilize the mandible in the physiologic subluxated position. This technique provides an adequate exposure of the distal internal carotid artery as with the other methods, and the risk of morbidity is very low.",

Owing to the delayed occurrence of these adverse effects, the optimal time of surgical intervention after Onyx embolization should be discussed and perhaps expedited.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare yet highly lethal injury associated with blunt force deceleration injury. The adoption of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has become a safer option than traditional open repair. The purpose of this study is to review a rural trauma center experience with TAI.\nA retrospective analysis was performed, reviewing all patients who presented with TAI between 2000 and 2009. Clinical, anatomical, and procedural variables of all cases were systematically reviewed. Clinical endpoints included mortality, and aortic-related mortality, and hospital length of stay. The study population was stratified by those that underwent surgical repair (SR) and those managed medically (MM).\nFifty-six patients presented with blunt TAI; 35 patients (62.5%) were surgically repaired (22 open, 13 TEVAR), while 21 (37.5%) were MM. The only difference in comorbidities was a higher rate of coronary artery disease in MM. Mean hospital arrival time (SR, 188.6 \u00b1 30.3 minutes, MM, 253 \u00b1 65.3 minutes), aortic injury grade (SR, 2.7 \u00b1 0.1; MM, 2.3 \u00b1 0.2), and injury severity score were not significantly different between the groups. Head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) was worse in the MM group, while chest AIS was worse in the SR group (P < .05). There were nine (42.9%) deaths in the MM group, while there were only two (5.7%) in the SR group (P < .001). There was no significant difference in aortic-related mortality. Mean follow-up time was not statistically different.\nThese data provide a group of stable patients to examine the management of TAI in the endovascular era. The low aortic-related mortality in the MM group demonstrates that there is time for a thorough evaluation in patients sustaining TAI who arrive without hemodynamic instability.",

    "abstract": "Great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence is the most common cause of superficial venous insufficiency. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) is superior to conventional ligation and stripping, and endovenous laser treatment (EVL) has emerged as an effective alternative to RFA. This randomized study evaluated RFA and EVL for superficial venous insufficiency due to GSV incompetence and compared early and 1-year results.\nBetween June 2006 and May 2008, patients with symptomatic primary venous insufficiency due to GSV incompetence were randomized to RFA or EVL. Patients with bilateral disease were randomized for treatment of the first leg and received the alternative method on the other. Pretreatment examination included a leg assessment using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and CEAP classification. Patients completed the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CIVIQ2). RFA was performed with the ClosurePlus system (VNUS Medical Technologies, Sunnyvale, Calif). EVL was performed with the EVLT system (AngioDynamics Inc, Queensbury, NY). Early (1-week and 1-month) postoperative results of pain, bruising, erythema, and hematoma were recorded. Duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging was used at 1 week and 1 year to evaluate vein status. VCSS scores and CEAP clinical class were recorded at each postoperative visit, and quality of life (QOL) using CIVIQ2 was assessed at 1 month and 1 year.\nThe study enrolled 118 patients (141 limbs): 46 (39%) were randomized to RFA and 48 (40%) to EVL, and 24 (20%) had bilateral GSV incompetence. At 1 week, one patient in the RFA group had an open GSV and was deemed a failure. More bruising occurred in the EVL group (P = .01) at 1 week, but at 1 month, there was no difference in bruising between groups. At 1 year, DU imaging showed evidence of recanalization with reflux in 11 RFA and 2 EVL patients (P = .002). The mean VCSS score change from baseline to 1 week postprocedure was higher for RFA than EVL (P = .002), but there was no difference between groups at 1 month (P = .07) and 1 year (P = .9). Overall QOL mean score improved over time for all patients (P < .001). CEAP clinical class scores of >or=3 were recorded in 21 RFA (44%) and 24 EVL patients (44%) pretreatment, but at 1-year, 9 RFA (19%) and 12 EVL patients (24%) had scores of >or=3 (P < .001). This represented a significant improvement in all patients compared with baseline.\nBoth methods of endovenous ablation effectively reduce symptoms of superficial venous insufficiency. EVL is associated with greater bruising and discomfort in the perioperative period but may provide a more secure closure over the long-term than RFA.",

    "abstract": "The principal aim of this study was to demonstrate that significant sac retraction (SSR) was a predictive marker of durable success after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). If verified, follow-up (FU) of patients with SSR may become unnecessary. In addition, the clinical features of the patients and aneurysms were analyzed to identify predictive factors of SSR.\nA group of 371 patients treated by EVAR had a complete clinical exam, computed tomography (CT) scan, and duplex scan follow-up. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. We assessed the difference between the largest diameter of the aneurysm (D) and the diameter of the stent-graft body (D1) on each postoperative CT scan. SSR was defined as a minimum of 75% reduction of this difference between the first and any of the following CT scans. Treatment success was defined as survival free of aneurysm-related death, type I or III endoleak, aneurysm expansion exceeding 5 mm, rupture, surgical conversion, migration, and graft occlusion. To assess the predictive factors of SSR, we performed a multivariable analysis and a logistic regression of the most significant variables.\nSSR was observed in 24.8% (92/371) of the patients after an average of 26 \u00b1 21 months of FU. The mean duration of FU in this group was 50 \u00b1 26 months (vs 45 \u00b1 25 months; P = NS). Survival was significantly longer in the SSR group (96 \u00b1 3 months vs 93 \u00b1 3 months; P < .05). No rupture, surgical, or endovascular conversion was reported in the SSR group. The frequency of type I (2.2% vs 15.4%; P < .001), type II (3.3% vs 29.4%; P < 10(-6)), and secondary interventions (3.3% vs 13.3%;P < .05) was lower in the SSR group. All type I and III endoleaks were diagnosed and treated before SSR detection. Since SSR was detected, treatment success remained until last follow-up in 98.9% (91 of 92) of the patients. The independent predictive factors of SSR were abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter < 55 mm (odds ratio [OR] 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.16-7.11), infra renal aorta diameter < 23 mm (OR 2.96; 95% CI: 1.74-5.03), and a proximal neck length > 22 mm (OR 2.41; 95% CI: 1.42-4.10).\nIn this series, SSR was accurately predictive of a durable success after EVAR. It occurred mostly in patients with a favorable anatomy. Less intensive follow-up work up seems to be safe in patients with SSR.",

We evaluated the possible prognostic values of CRP on outcomes in hemodialysis patients undergoing EVT.\nA total of 234 hemodialysis patients undergoing EVT for peripheral artery disease were enrolled and followed-up for up to 5 years. They were divided into tertiles according to serum CRP levels (lowest tertile, < 1.4 mg/L; middle tertile, 1.4-6.0 mg/L; highest tertile, \u2265 6.0 mg/L). We analyzed the incidence of any reintervention or above-ankle amputation of the limb index (RAO) and any-cause death.\nKaplan-Meier analysis showed that the event-free rate from the composite end point of RAO and any-cause death for 5 years was 60.2% in the lowest tertile, 50.0% in the middle tertile, and 25.1% in the highest tertile (P < .0001). The survival rate from any-cause death for 5 years was 81.5% in the lowest tertile, 65.2% in the middle tertile, and 59.3% in the highest tertile (P = .0078). Even after adjusting for other risk factors at baseline, preprocedural CRP levels were a significant predictive factor for RAO and any-cause death after EVT in a multivariable Cox analysis.\nElevated preprocedural serum CRP levels were associated with RAO and any-cause death after EVT in hemodialysis patients with peripheral artery disease.",

Based on this, we propose steps to improve the results of CAS for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nPubMed/Medline was searched up to March 25, 2010 for studies investigating the efficacy of CAS for the management of symptomatic carotid stenosis. Search terms used were \"carotid artery stenting,\" \"symptomatic carotid artery stenosis,\" \"carotid endarterectomy,\" \"stroke,\" \"recurrent carotid stenosis,\" and \"long-term results\" in various combinations.\nCurrent data suggest that CAS is not equivalent to CEA for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis. Differences in carotid plaque morphology and a higher incidence of microemboli and cerebrovascular events during and after CAS compared with CEA may account for these inferior results.\nCurrently, most symptomatic patients are inappropriate candidates for CAS. Improved CAS technology referable to stent design and embolic protection strategies may alter this conclusion in the future.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to tremendous blood flow-induced venous wall thickening during the maturation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, how veins in the fistula sense a dramatic change in the blood flow remains unknown. Because mechanosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid channels (TRPVs) are present in the endothelium, we examined whether the Ca2+-permeable TRPVs play a role in remodeling of fistula veins.\nThe fistula veins were generated at femoral AVF of Wistar rats. Changes in the hemodynamics and the width and internal radius of the iliac vein were studied at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days, then the iliac vein was removed and examined for changes in wall thickness and protein or mRNA expression by immunofluorecent stain, Western blot, or real time PCR. Changes in MMP2 activity was examined by gelatin zymography. Two ligatures were performed in iliac vein to prevent venodilatation to confirm the effect of dramatic changes in hemodynamics on TRPV expression. The specific role of TRPV was studied in another group of fistula veins given with capsazepine via a subcutaneous mini-osmotic pump for 28 days.\nThe fistula veins demonstrated high flow/wall shear stress (WSS), wall thickening, and venodilatation compared with control veins. The WSS increase was positively correlated with upregulation of TRPV1, but not TRPV4. Narrowing fistula veins prevented TRPV1 upregulation, indicating that high flow directly upregulates TRPV1. We examined the underlying signaling components and found that enhanced Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) activity upregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and downregulated arginase I in the fistula veins. These changes were reversed by a CaMK II inhibitor. The relative levels of eNOS and arginase I activity consequently augmented NO formation, which coincided with an increase in MMP2 activity. Chronic inhibition of TRPV1 in the fistula veins by capsazepine showed no effect on high flow and TRPV1 expression, but markedly attenuated WSS, which was concomitantly associated with attenuation of CaMK II activity, NO-dependent MMP2 activation, and remodeling.\nThese findings indicate that TRPV1 is essential in the remodeling of AVFs and that WSS leads to TRPV1 upregulation, which then enhances remodeling, therefore, inhibition of TRPV1 pathway may prolong the lifespan of an AVF by decreasing WSS and vein wall remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Despite the absence of a relationship between cholesterol and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion, there is evidence from a number of studies to suggest that statin therapy may influence AAA expansion, presumably through pleiotropic effects. To confirm whether statin therapy is associated with less AAA expansion, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical controlled studies of statin therapy for prevention of AAA expansion.\nTo identify all clinical studies of statin therapy vs control (no statins) enrolling patients with small (\u2264 55 mm) AAA, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. For each study, data regarding AAA expansion in both the statin and control groups were used to generate standardized mean differences (SMDs; <0 favoring statin therapy; >0 favoring control) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic SMDs in fixed-effects and random-effects models.\nWe identified five clinical controlled studies of statin therapy vs control enrolling patients with small AAA, including no randomized and five observational studies. Our meta-analysis included data on 697 patients with small AAA received statin therapy or no statins. Pooled analysis demonstrated that statin therapy was statistically significantly associated with less expansion rates (random-effects SMD, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.25; P = .0001). There was statistically significant trial heterogeneity of results (P = .03). Exclusion of any single trial from the analysis did not substantively alter the overall result of our analysis. There was no evidence of significant publication bias (P = .81).\nStatin therapy is associated with less expansion rates in patients with small AAA.

    "abstract": "With the decline of diagnostic angiography, clinicians increasingly rely upon duplex scan criteria to select appropriate asymptomatic candidates for carotid intervention. Some recent trials have enrolled patients for intervention based upon end diastolic velocities (EDVs) as low as 100 cm/second, and peak systolic velocities (PSVs) as low as 230 cm/second. In as much as we have used more selective duplex scan criteria, we reviewed the course of asymptomatic patients who had EDVs from 100 to 124 cm/second.\nOf the patients evaluated in our Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) accredited laboratory from 2002 to 2007, 144 patients had an EDV 100 to 124 cm/second. Of these, 47 patients underwent initial carotid intervention for concomitant symptoms (10), contralateral occlusion (3), or other imaging findings felt to warrant intervention. The remaining 97 asymptomatic patients were followed. One patient had both arteries fall within this EDV range. The mean follow-up for the 98 arteries was 29.1 months (range, 2-116 months).\nFive patients (5.2%) developed ipsilateral symptoms consisting of one stroke and four transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), at a mean time of 35.3 months (range, 12-58 months). Twenty-six patients (26.8%), including 3 who also developed ipsilateral symptoms, progressed to having an EDV of \u2265 125 cm/second at a mean time of 24 months (range, 2-58). Two of these (2.1%) progressed directly to occlusion without symptoms and with no documented interim worsening of stenosis.\nFor asymptomatic individuals with an initial EDV of 100 to 124 cm/second, the risk of ipsilateral stroke is small and, therefore, medical management is appropriate in most cases. However, the risk of progression to a more severe degree of stenosis, often warranting carotid intervention, is clinically meaningful. Yearly duplex scan follow-up is necessary to assess disease progression in this patient cohort.",

    "abstract": "Half of all lower limb deep vein thromboses (DVT) are distal DVT that are equally distributed between muscular calf vein thromboses (MCVT) and deep calf vein thromboses (DCVT). Despite their high prevalence, MCVT and DCVT have never been compared so far, which prevents possible modulation of distal DVT management according to the kind of distal DVT (MCVT or DCVT).\nUsing data from the French, multicenter, prospective observational OPTimisation de l'Interrogatoire dans l'\u00e9valuation du risque throMbo-Embolique Veineux (OPTIMEV) study, we compared the clinical presentation and risk factors of 268 symptomatic isolated DCVT and 457 symptomatic isolated MCVT and the 3-month outcomes of the 222 DCVT and 390 MCVT that were followed-up.\nDuring the entire follow-up, 86.5% of DCVT patients and 76.7% of MCVT patients were treated with anticoagulant drugs (P = .003). MCVT was significantly more associated with localized pain than DCVT (30.4% vs 22.4%, P = .02) and less associated with swelling (47.9% vs 62.7%, P < .001). MCVT and DCVT patients exhibited the same risk factors profile, except that recent surgery was slightly more associated with DCVT (odds ratio, 1.70%; confidence interval, 1.06-2.75), and had equivalent comorbidities as evaluated by the Charlson index. At 3 months, no statistically significant difference was noted between MCVT and DCVT in death (3.8% vs 4.1%), venous thromboembolism recurrence (1.5% vs 1.4%), and major bleeding (0% vs 0.5%).\nIsolated symptomatic MCVT and DCVT exhibit different clinical symptoms at presentation but affect the same patient population. Under anticoagulant treatment and in the short-term, isolated distal DVT constitutes a homogeneous entity. Therapeutic trials are needed to determine a consensual mode of care of MCVT and DCVT.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk.\nWe used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nWe observed a positive association with increasing years of smoking and cigarettes smoked and a negative association with smoking cessation. Excess weight was associated with increased risk, whereas exercise and consumption of nuts, vegetables, and fruits were associated with reduced risk. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had lower risk of AAA than whites and Native Americans. Well-known risk factors were reaffirmed, including male gender, age, family history, and cardiovascular disease. A predictive scoring system was created that identifies aneurysms more efficiently than current criteria and includes women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged <65 years. Using this model on national statistics of risk factors prevalence, we estimated 1.1 million AAAs in the United States, of which 569,000 are among women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged <65 years.\nSmoking cessation and a healthy lifestyle are associated with lower risk of AAA. We estimated that about half of the patients with AAA disease are not eligible for screening under current guidelines. We have created a high-yield screening algorithm that expands the target population for screening by including at-risk individuals not identified with existing screening criteria.",

    "abstract": "The ideal treatment for hospitalized patients with isolated gastrocnemius and/or soleal venous thrombosis is unclear. Recommendations range from watchful waiting to full-dose anticoagulation. This study examines the effectiveness of practice patterns at a single institution as measured by progression of thrombus.\nAll consecutive inpatients with a duplex scan diagnosis of isolated gastrocnemius and/or soleal vein clot (no other thrombotic segments were identified) and where two consecutive duplex studies (Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories laboratory) were available for review were included. Two study groups were identified. TX group included patients who received anticoagulation treatment (heparin [fractionated or unfractionated], heparin substitutes, or warfarin) and the NoTX group included those who did not receive anticoagulant. Demographic, risk factors, comorbidities, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, ambulatory status, and underlying hypercoagulable states were recorded. Thrombus progression rate in the two groups was compared using the \u03c72 test. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the effect of anticoagulation treatment as well as the above demographic and clinical factors on the risk of progression.\nA total of 141 patients were included in the study, 76 of whom (54%) received anticoagulation. Forty-three patients (30%) had progression of their venous thrombosis: 33% (25/76) in the TX group and 28% (18/65) in the NoTX group (P=.50, by \u03c72 test). Results from multivariate logistic regression showed that treatment had no significant impact on outcome (Odds ratio=1.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.55-3.01; P=.57]. Patients with end-stage renal disease (6%), or stroke (13%) had significantly higher risk of progression (P<.05). None of the other clinical or demographic factors were significantly associated with the risk of progression.\nThe results speak to the lack of efficacy of anticoagulation in the management of gastrocnemius and/or soleal vein thrombosis in the hospitalized patient. When measured by thrombus progression, treating these patients without anticoagulation appears to be equally efficacious as subjecting patients to anticoagulant therapy. A prospective, randomized clinical trial will be an important step in fully addressing this clinical dilemma.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is a potential strategy for reducing intimal thickening during in-stent restenosis and vein graft failure. In this study, we examined the effect of disrupting the function of the VSMC adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, using antagonists, neutralizing antibodies, and a dominant negative, on VSMC migration and intimal thickening. Migration was assessed by the scratch-wound assay of human saphenous vein VSMCs and in a human saphenous vein ex vivo organ culture model of intimal thickening.\nInhibition of cadherin function using a pan-cadherin antagonist, significantly reduced migration by 53%\u00b18% compared with the control peptide (n=3; P<.05). Furthermore, inhibition of N-cadherin function with an N-cadherin antagonist, neutralizing antibodies, and adenoviral expression of dominant negative N-cadherin (RAd dn-N-cadherin), significantly reduced migration by 31%\u00b12%, 23%\u00b11% and 32%\u00b17% compared with controls, respectively (n=3; P<.05). Inhibition of cadherin function significantly increased apoptosis by between 1.5- and 3.3-fold at the wound edge. In an ex vivo model of intimal thickening, inhibition of N-cadherin function by infection of human saphenous vein segments with RAd dn-N-cadherin significantly reduced VSMC migration by 55% and increased VSMC apoptosis by 2.7-fold. As a result, intimal thickening was significantly suppressed by 54%\u00b114%. Importantly, there was no detrimental effect of dn-N-cadherin on endothelial coverage; in fact, it was significantly increased, as was survival of cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells.\nUnder the condition of this study, cell-cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin regulates VSMC migration via modulation of viability. Interestingly, inhibition of N-cadherin function significantly retards intimal thickening via inhibition of VSMC migration and promotion of endothelial cell survival. We suggest that disruption of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts is a potential strategy for reducing VSMC migration and intimal thickening.",

    "abstract": "In July 2007, our group began to use a modified conical inferior vena cava filter with additional stabilizing struts designed to reduce tilting of retrievable filters. We analyzed our experience with this modified filter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 and compared it to our experience with the standard filter (G\u00fcnther Tulip, Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008 to determine if adoption of the modified filter reduced tilting and delivered a discernible clinical benefit.\nThe primary outcome measure was tilt angle after deployment. Secondary outcomes were change in tilt angle between deployment and retrieval (self-centering) and retrieval failure due to inability to engage the filter hook. Measurements were retrospectively determined using the anteroposterior venogram at the time of placement and removal. Tilt angle was defined by the center line of the filter relative to the center line of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Statistical significance was assumed for P \u2264 .05.\nDuring the study period, a total of 302 IVC filters were placed. Retrieval was attempted for 85 of 194 (44%) standard filters and 52 of 108 (48%) modified filters. The overall difference in tilt angle (degrees) between the standard (median [interquartile range] = 5 [3, 8]) and modified (5 [3, 8]) filters at the time of placement was not statistically significant (P = .44). Modified filters deployed through a femoral route (8 [4, 11]) had significantly greater tilt angles than modified filters deployed using jugular access (4 [2, 6]; P < .0001). At the time of retrieval, evidence of self-centering was observed more often with modified (32 of 52 [62%]) than standard (36 of 85 [42%]) filters (P = .03). Overall, there were only four failures to retrieve the filter due to excess tilting (standard, 3 of 85 [4%], modified, 1 of 52 [2%]; P = .59).\nOverall, tilt angle at insertion did not differ between the modified and standard filters, although more modified filters displayed self-centering. There was no difference between the groups in retrieval failure due to excess tilting. Despite its greater tendency to self-center, we did not recognize a measurable clinical advantage of the modified filter.",

    "abstract": "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare disorder characterized by abdominal pain and compression of the celiac artery. Traditional management consists of open MAL division, with or without arterial reconstruction. We present our outcomes using a laparoscopic approach and compare them to patients treated with open MAL division during the same period.\nA retrospective medical records review of all patients with MALS treated at the University of California-Los Angeles from January 1999 to 2009 was performed.\nFourteen patients with MALS were treated. All patients underwent an extensive preoperative gastrointestinal (GI) workup with 10 undergoing attempted laparoscopic division of the MAL and celiac ganglion (laparoscopic ganglionectomy [LG]). Two intraoperative conversions were performed for bleeding. Six patients were treated in the open surgery group (open ganglionectomy [OG]). There were no deaths or reoperations in either group. Median time to feeding was 1.0 vs 2.8 days (P\u2264.05) in the LG and OG groups, respectively, which was statistically significant. Median length of hospitalization was also significantly lower in the LG group compared with the OG group (2.3 vs 7.0 days; P\u2264.05). Eight patients had LG (100%) and 5 patients had OG (83%) and had immediate symptom resolution (postoperative day 1). Three patients with recurrent symptoms after LG underwent angiography demonstrating persistent celiac stenosis, then an angioplasty was performed. Median follow-up was 14.0 months (2-65 months) for all patients. Three patients who received LG (38%) and 3 patients who received OG (50%) had persistent pain at last follow-up. Six patients in the OG group (100%) and 7 patients in the LG group (88%) had ceased taking chronic oral narcotics at their last follow-up visit.\nBoth laparoscopic and open MAL division and celiac ganglionectomy can be safely performed with minimal patient morbidity and mortality. Late recurrence is frequently seen; however, this seems to be milder than the presenting symptoms. The laparoscopic approach results in avoidance of laparotomy and was associated with shorter inpatient hospitalization and decreased time to feeding in our study. Optimal patient selection and prediction of clinical response in these patients remains a challenge.",

Objective of this article was to compare the efficacy and safety of a short-term course of anticoagulation with compression therapy alone.\nWe prospectively randomized patients with symptomatic, sonographically proven ICMVT in the soleal and/or gastrocnemial muscle veins in two treatment arms. The first received low-molecular-weight heparin for 10 days at therapeutic dosage (nadroparin 180 anti-activated factor X units once daily) and compression therapy for three months, and the second received compression therapy alone. Primary efficacy endpoint of the study was sonographically proven progression of ICMVT into the deep veins and clinical pulmonary embolism (PE) as confirmed by objective testing. Secondary efficacy and primary safety endpoints were major bleeding, death not due to PE, and complete sonographically proven recanalization of the muscle vein. We assessed transient and permanent risk factors for venous thromboembolism.\nOne-hundred seven patients were finally ruled eligible for evaluation: 89% outpatients, 11% hospitalized patients. In the heparin group (n=54) progression to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in two patients (3.7%), in the group compression therapy alone (n=53) progression to DVT occurred in two patients (n.s.). No clinical PE and no death occurred. Thrombus recanalization after 3 months was not statistically significant different between the two study groups.

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) plays an important role in the vasculature; however, the role of PPAR\u03b3 in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is not well understood. We hypothesized that PPAR\u03b3 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) attenuates the development of AAA. We also investigated PPAR\u03b3-mediated signaling pathways that may prevent the development of AAA.\nWe determined whether periaortic application of CaCl(2) renders vascular SMC-selective PPAR\u03b3 knockout (SMPG KO) mice more susceptible to destruction of normal aortic wall architecture.\nThere is evidence of increased vessel dilatation in the abdominal aorta 6 weeks after 0.25M periaortic CaCl(2) application in SMPG KO mice compared with littermate controls (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 mm [n = 8] vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 mm [n = 7]; P = .000119). Results from SMPG KO mice indicate medial layer elastin degradation was greater 6 weeks after abluminal application of CaCl(2) to the abdominal aorta (P < .01). Activated cathepsin S, a potent elastin-degrading enzyme, was increased in SMPG KO mice vs wild-type controls. To further identify a role of PPAR\u03b3 signaling in reducing the development of AAA, we demonstrated that adenoviral-mediated PPAR\u03b3 overexpression in cultured rat aortic SMCs decreases (P = .022) the messenger RNA levels of cathepsin S. In addition, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay detected PPAR\u03b3 bound to a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) -141 to -159 bp upstream of the cathepsin S gene sequence in mouse aortic SMCs. Also, adenoviral-mediated PPAR\u03b3 overexpression and knockdown in cultured rat aortic SMCs decreases (P = .013) and increases (P = .018) expression of activated cathepsin S. Finally, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a greater inflammatory infiltrate in SMPG KO mouse aortas, as evidenced by elevations in F4/80 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 expression.\nIn this study, we identify PPAR\u03b3 as an important contributor in attenuating the development of aortic aneurysms by demonstrating that loss of PPAR\u03b3 in vascular SMCs promotes aortic dilatation and elastin degradation. Thus, PPAR\u03b3 activation may be potentially promising medical therapy in reducing the risk of AAA progression and rupture.",

    "results": "There is evidence of increased vessel dilatation in the abdominal aorta 6 weeks after 0.25M periaortic CaCl(2) application in SMPG KO mice compared with littermate controls (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 mm [n = 8] vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 mm [n = 7]; P = .000119). Results from SMPG KO mice indicate medial layer elastin degradation was greater 6 weeks after abluminal application of CaCl(2) to the abdominal aorta (P < .01). Activated cathepsin S, a potent elastin-degrading enzyme, was increased in SMPG KO mice vs wild-type controls. To further identify a role of PPAR\u03b3 signaling in reducing the development of AAA, we demonstrated that adenoviral-mediated PPAR\u03b3 overexpression in cultured rat aortic SMCs decreases (P = .022) the messenger RNA levels of cathepsin S. In addition, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay detected PPAR\u03b3 bound to a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) -141 to -159 bp upstream of the cathepsin S gene sequence in mouse aortic SMCs. Also, adenoviral-mediated PPAR\u03b3 overexpression and knockdown in cultured rat aortic SMCs decreases (P = .013) and increases (P = .018) expression of activated cathepsin S. Finally, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a greater inflammatory infiltrate in SMPG KO mouse aortas, as evidenced by elevations in F4/80 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) offering an observation/no treatment (OBS/NoRx) arm as control and which are focused on the management of a condition with potentially life-threatening consequences, however small the risk, often experience a significant rate of crossover to treatment by those randomized to the OBS/NoRx arm. Results of these trials when analyzed on intent-to-treat basis often fail to resolve the issue at which they were directed. The authors have observed this in trials of abdominal aortic aneurysms with this design and use these to exemplify the dilemmas RCTs of such design create, with crossovers ranging from 27% to over 60% (EVAR II, UKSAT, ADAM, PIVOTAL). Results of these trials are frequently used as level I medical evidence and their potential impact on clinical decision making and reimbursement can be quite significant and long-lasting. Recommendations regarding trial end points and suggestions to mitigate the high crossover effect are offered. It may be that some clinical conditions dealing with potentially life-threatening problems should not be studied in randomized prospective clinical trials containing an OBS/NoRx arm.",

    "abstract": "Markers of inflammation and fibrin turnover are elevated in individuals with a large (>55 mm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Fibrin degradation generates D-dimer, known to possess multiple proinflammatory effects, and levels are elevated during early AAA development. This study characterized the plasma inflammatory response during early AAA pathogenesis to determine the effect of D-dimer levels.\nThe study compared 75 men with a small AAA (range, 30-54 mm) with 90 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), complement C3, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels were measured.\nMean levels of fibrinogen (2.92 vs 2.59 g/L; P = .003), hsCRP (2.07 vs 1.29 ng/mL; P = .005), and D-dimer (346.7 vs 120.2 ng/mL; P < .001) were higher in men with a small AAA. These markers correlated with maximum aortic diameter determined by ultrasound imaging. On multivariate analysis, D-dimer levels were elevated in AAA individuals independent of smoking, cardiovascular disease (CVD), atherosclerotic risk factors, and inflammatory parameters. Fibrinogen and hsCRP levels remained elevated after adjustment for these covariates but lost significance when D-dimer was added to the model.\nC-reactive protein and D-dimer levels are elevated during early AAA development. D-dimer levels are most tightly associated with AAA status, however, and may mediate the observed elevation in acute-phase reactants.",

This study reviewed the independent associations of commonly used medications and AAA growth during a 25-year period of AAA surveillance.\nThe study included all patients monitored through an AAA screening and surveillance program. Records of AAA size, risk factors, outcomes, death, and medications were entered into a continually updated database. AAA growth rates were calculated using a flexible hierarchical model. A multivariate model was used to test for associations independent of confounders.\nThe study comprised 1269 patients (94.1% men) who had a mean age of 67 years. The median starting diameter was 35 mm, the end diameter was 44 mm, and follow-up was 3.4 years. Drugs used in the treatment of diabetes were associated with a 56% reduction in AAA growth rate (P = .01) independent of confounding factors, including other therapeutic agents (P = .003). Angiotensin-receptor blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics were also associated with slower AAA growth rates, although these effects were not independent of all confounders.\nDiabetes or its medications, or both, have a negative effect on AAA growth. Because of polypharmacy, demonstrating the independent effects of individual drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system was not possible. In light of this analysis, however, strong associations between angiotensin-receptor blockers and aldosterone-receptor blockers and slowed AAA progression are credible.",

We systemically observed the vascular changes at the puncture segments of arteriovenous fistulas.\nThe native arteriovenous fistulas in 104 patients on maintenance hemodialysis using the buttonhole technique for puncture were studied. We used the duplex scan to observe the intimal lesions, the maximal diameters at the arterial and venous puncture segments, and the references.\nIntimal lesions were found in 42% and 40% of the arterial and venous puncture segments, none of which resulted in significant luminal stenosis. The differences between diameters at the arterial or venous puncture segments and the corresponding references were significant (arterial, 11.07 +/- 4.45 vs 6.85 +/- 2.35 mm, P < .001; venous, 8.82 +/- 4.13 vs 5.54 +/- 2.22 mm, P < .001). All segments, except only three arterial and four venous puncture segments, were larger than the corresponding references. The degree of vascular dilatation, defined as the diameter difference between the puncture segments and the references calibrated by the reference diameter, were 64.1 +/- 49.6% at arterial puncture segments and 59.9 +/- 42.2% at venous segments. Multivariate analysis revealed that the patient age and the puncture duration were strongly correlated with the degree of vascular dilatation at both the arterial (P = .018 and .007, respectively) and venous puncture segments (P = .020 and .011, respectively).\nPuncture of arteriovenous fistula using a buttonhole technique resulted in a consistent vascular dilatation and moderately high incidence of intimal thickness, but no significant luminal stenosis was found.",

The differences between diameters at the arterial or venous puncture segments and the corresponding references were significant (arterial, 11.07 +/- 4.45 vs 6.85 +/- 2.35 mm, P < .001; venous, 8.82 +/- 4.13 vs 5.54 +/- 2.22 mm, P < .001). All segments, except only three arterial and four venous puncture segments, were larger than the corresponding references. The degree of vascular dilatation, defined as the diameter difference between the puncture segments and the references calibrated by the reference diameter, were 64.1 +/- 49.6% at arterial puncture segments and 59.9 +/- 42.2% at venous segments. Multivariate analysis revealed that the patient age and the puncture duration were strongly correlated with the degree of vascular dilatation at both the arterial (P = .018 and .007, respectively) and venous puncture segments (P = .020 and .011, respectively).",

    "abstract": "The altered structure and composition of the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2), which is a Ca(2+)-dependent cross-linking enzyme, has been proven the importance for ECM homeostasis, but there is no evidence of TG2 in AAA formation. The hypothesis was investigated that TG2 contributes to protect aortic walls during remodeling of the AAAs.\nIn a rat abdominal aortic aneurysm model using a combination of intraluminal elastase infusion and extraluminal calcium chloride, TG2 expression and activity were evaluated at 1 and 8 weeks after the AAA preparation (n = 6 at each endpoint), compared with those of the non-prepared aorta (n = 6). Additionally, ex vivo experiments of isolated AAA tissue culture with recombinant human TG2, TG2 inhibitor cystamine, or tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were performed.\nTG2 mRNA expression in the AAAs was significantly upregulated at both 1 and 8 weeks (22.4-fold and 5.4-fold increases of the non-prepared aorta, P = .0022 and P = .0048, respectively). TG2 protein expression and activity were also enhanced by fluorescent staining of the AAAs. Similar mRNA upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 was observed in the AAAs, and TG2 and TNF-\u03b1 were colocalized in the aortic walls at 1 week. Ex vivo experiments showed that mRNA expressions of TNF-\u03b1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the cultured AAA tissue were decreased by exogenous TG2, whereas were increased by cystamine. TNF-\u03b1 exposure to the AAA tissues was significantly upregulated TG2 mRNA expression (P = .0333).\nTG2 expression and activity in AAA formation were enhanced, possibly due to compensatory reaction. TG2 has a potential role of ECM protector in aortic walls during remodeling of the AAAs.",

    "abstract": "One-piece great saphenous vein (GSV) is the conduit of choice in infrainguinal revascularizations for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Unfortunately, adequate length of usable GSV is not always available. Despite inferior patency rates compared with GSV, prosthetic and arm vein conduits are generally considered usable. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of infrainguinal arm vein and prosthetic bypass.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 290 consecutive infrainguinal bypasses for CLI using arm vein conduit (n = 130) or prosthetic graft (n = 160) during January 2000 and December 2006 at our institution. The groups were compared for risk factors, indication for surgery, and runoff score. Survival, leg salvage, and patency rates were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nMedian surveillance time was 35 months (range 0-118 months). The age, gender, and usual risk factors were similar in arm vein and prosthetic groups, except cerebrovascular disease that was more common in the prosthetic group (P = .011). Indication for surgery was CLI. In the arm vein group, more than two-thirds (70.2%) of the procedures were for ischemic ulcer or gangrene, whereas in the prosthetic group the main indication was ischemic rest pain (51.3%). When the outcome of femoropopliteal bypasses was analyzed, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. However, in infrapopliteal revascularizations primary patency, assisted primary patency, and secondary patency rates at 3 years were significantly better in the arm vein group: 28.3% (SE +/- 6.3%) vs 9.6% (SE +/- 8.1%) (P = .031), 56.8% (SE +/- 6.6%) vs 10.4% (SE +/- 8.7%) (P = .000), and 57.4% (SE +/- 6.6) vs 11.2% (SE +/- 9.3%) (P = .000), respectively. Leg salvage and survival at 3 years were 75.0% (SE +/- 4.9%) vs 57.1% (SE +/- 8.8%) (P = .005) and 58.8% (SE +/- 5.1%) vs 39.5% (SE +/- 7.7%) (P = .007), respectively.\nArm vein conduits, even when spliced, are superior to prosthetic grafts in terms of midterm assisted primary patency, secondary patency, and leg salvage in infrapopliteal bypasses for CLI.",

Complications include lower extremity ischemia from femoral artery cannulation. We examined the outcomes of patients placed on ECMO/CPS, including the rate of limb ischemia.\nAll instances of ECMO/CPS over a 3-year period (2006-2009) at a single university hospital were examined retrospectively for cannulation strategy, perfusion strategy, mortality, and limb ischemia. Potential predictors of limb ischemia with femoral artery cannulation were age, gender, body surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), and arterial cannula size.\nFifty-eight patients were placed on ECMO/CPS. Of these, 43 patients (74%) had femoral arterial cannulation. In 10 patients, the superficial femoral artery (SFA) was cannulated prophylactically (without antecedent limb ischemia) and perfused in the antegrade direction from a branch of the ECMO/CPS circuit. In 7 of the remaining 33 patients (21%), limb ischemia developed requiring decannulation with fasciotomy (n = 4) or additional cannulation of the SFA with branching of the ECMO/CPS circuit (n = 3). One patient with ipsilateral leg ischemia required eventual amputation. Patients with limb ischemia were significantly younger than those who did not develop limb ischemia (P = .001). BSA, BMI, and cannula size did not predict limb ischemia. Overall 30-day mortality following the initiation of ECMO/CPS was 79%. There was no correlation between limb ischemia and mortality.\nYounger patients may be at increased risk for lower extremity arterial insufficiency with femoral cannulation for ECMO/CPS. Prophylactic or expectant SFA cannulation are reasonable approaches.",

    "abstract": "Within the context of healthcare system reform, the cost efficacy of lower extremity revascularization remains a timely topic. The impact of an individual patient's socioeconomic status represents an under-studied aspect of vascular care, especially with respect to longitudinal costs and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and clinical outcomes as well as inpatient hospital costs.\nA retrospective femoropopliteal revascularization database, which included socioeconomic factors (household income, education level, and payor status), in addition to standard demographic, clinical, anatomical, and procedural variables were analyzed over a 3-year period. Patients were stratified by income level (low income [LI] <200% federal poverty level [$42,400 for a household of 4], and higher income [HI] >200% federal poverty level) and revascularization technique (open vs endovascular) and analyzed for the endpoints of primary assisted patency, amortized cost-per-day of patency, and limb salvage. Data were analyzed with univariate and multivariate techniques.\nA total of 187 cases were identified with complete data for analysis, 146 in the LI and 41 in the HI cohorts. LI patients differed from HI patients by mean age (66.2 +/- 1.0 vs 61.8 +/- 1.5 years, P = .04), high school graduate rate (51.4% vs 85.4%, P < .001), presence of tissue loss (30.1% vs 14.6%, P = .05), female gender (43.7% vs 22.0%, P = .01) and preoperative statin use (45.8% vs 75.6%, P < .001). There were no differences with respect to other comorbidities including smoking status, presence of diabetes, renal insufficiency, anatomic factors or treatment modality (open vs endovascular). Ninety-seven patients underwent endovascular revascularization. The following outcomes were noted in the endovascular subset of LI and HI patients respectively: primary assisted patency (66% vs 71%, P = NS) and 12-month cost-per-day of patency ($166.30 +/- 77.40 vs $22.45 +/- 12.45, P = .05). Ninety-eight patients underwent open revascularization, with the following outcomes in LI and HI patients respectively: primary assisted patency (78% vs 86%, P = NS) and 12-month cost-per-day of patency ($319.43 +/- 225.44 vs $40.47 +/- 4.63, P = .07). Of the 77 patients with critical limb ischemia, 19 underwent eventual amputation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that income above 100% of the federal poverty line was protective against limb loss (odds ratio 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.51, P < .001).\nIncome level correlates with advanced presentation, advanced age, and lack of statin use. Although primary assisted patency rate is not affected by income status, an increased cost-per-day of patency and inferior limb salvage is found in lower income patients.",

    "abstract": "Historically thoracic aortic rupture secondary to trauma was treated with cardiopulmonary bypass and open surgery. With the advent of endovascular grafting, physicians have the ability to reconstruct the thoracic aortic transection using a less invasive technique. In this study, we examine our experience with stent graft repair of thoracic transections secondary to trauma.\nThe medical records of patients treated at a level I trauma center from 2005 to 2008 were reviewed. Those patients who had an aortic transection treated with an endograft were identified and evaluated for in-hospital mortality and morbidity and concurrent injuries. Demographics, procedural details, and outcomes were analyzed.\nOver a 3-year period, 18 thoracic aortic transections secondary to trauma were identified in patients with a mean age of 43 (range, 16-80). Primary technical success was 100%. None of the patients required explant or open repair during this time period. In-hospital mortality was 2 of 18 (11%); all patients had multiple trauma including long bone fractures. The subclavian artery origin was covered by the stent graft in 9 of the 18 patients. The mean estimated blood loss per procedure was 222 cc. No patient in this series had postoperative paraplegia. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 50 months with an average of 13 months. There have been no late explantation or device failures identified.\nEndovascular repair of traumatic thoracic aortic transections can be performed safely with a relatively low mortality and morbidity and should be the procedure of choice for patients presenting with traumatic thoracic aortic ruptures.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to identify risk factors for late mortality after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).\nA retrospective analysis of consecutive TEVAR was conducted. Medical record review, telephone contact, or query of the Social Security Death Index was used to determine 30-day and late survival. Late mortality was assessed with respect to patient characteristics at the time of the initial treatment, preoperative laboratory values, pathology, clinical presentation, and treatment adjuncts. Significant univariate predictors of death were entered into a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.\nFrom 1998 to 2009, 252 patients (149 men; mean age, 68 years) underwent TEVAR for degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA, n = 143), type B dissection (n = 62), mycotic aneurysm (n = 13), traumatic disruption (n = 12), penetrating ulcer or intramural hematoma (n = 10), anastomotic pseudoaneurysm (n = 4), or other pathology (n = 8). The 30-day mortality was 9.5%, with stroke or spinal cord injury in 5.6%. Mean follow-up was 22 +/- 22 months. Kaplan-Meier mean survival was 53 months. Predictors of late mortality by univariate analysis included age (P < .01), cardiac arrhythmia (P = .03), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .05), aneurysm diameter (P < .01), rupture (P < .01), debranching (P = .02), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10.0 x 10(3)/microL; P < .01), albumin, (P < .01), and creatinine > 1.7 mg/dL (P = .01). Multivariate predictors of mortality included rupture (hazard ratio [HR], 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-9.44; P = .03), debranching (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.09-4.24; P = .03), preoperative leukocytosis (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.39; P = .001), and aneurysm diameter (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P = .04). Subgroup analysis of patients undergoing TEVAR for asymptomatic, nonruptured TAA demonstrated that debranching (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.13-5.39; P = .02), White blood cell count (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40; P < .04), and aneurysm diameter (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05, P < .01) remain independently predictive of late mortality.\nPreoperative leukocytosis, aneurysm diameter, and concurrent debranching independently predict late mortality irrespective of clinical presentation and may assist in risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "To establish associations between leg strength and mortality in men and women with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nThis was an observational, prospective study of 410 men and women with PAD aged 55 and older recruited from Chicago-area medical centers and followed for a mean of 60 months. The participants were followed for a mean of 60.0 months. Isometric knee extension, knee flexion, hip extension, and hip flexion were measured at baseline. Primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess relations between leg strength and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality among men and women, adjusting for age, race, comorbidities, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, and the ankle brachial index.\nAmong the 246 male participants, poorer baseline strength for knee flexion (P trend = .029), knee extension (P trend =.010), and hip extension (P trend = .013) were each associated independently with higher all-cause mortality. Poorer strength for knee flexion (P trend = .042) and hip extension (P trend = .029) were associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Compared with those in the fourth (best) baseline knee flexion quartile, hazard ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality among men in the first (poorest) knee flexion quartile were 2.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-4.87; P = .045) and 4.20 (95% CI, 1.12-15.79; P = .044), respectively. No significant associations of leg strength and all-cause mortality were identified among women.\nPoorer leg strength is associated with increased mortality in men, but not women, with PAD.

    "abstract": "Ischemic strokes represent more than 80% of total strokes in Western countries. The influence of dietary factors on ischemic stroke risk is debated mainly because available data are limited. Our objective was to compare the dietary pattern of symptomatic ischemic stroke patients under 65 years old with control subjects using a validated 14-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). We also compared symptomatic ischemic stroke patients with carotid atherosclerosis with those without according to the presence or the absence of carotid plaque defined by duplex scanning.\nThis was a case-control multi-center study that took place in one University hospital and two general hospitals in France. One hundred twenty-four symptomatic ischemic stroke patients (confirmation by a neurologist and imaging; 66% smokers) and 50 controls (34% smokers) without any known cardiovascular disease or previous nutritional advice were included. The main outcome measure(s) were intake scores for saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), Omega-3 polyunsaturated (Omega-3 PUFA), and Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega-6PUFA). Fruit and vegetables and an overall cardiovascular dietary score were evaluated with the FFQ. The overall cardiovascular score is calculated as (MUFA + Omega-3 PUFA + fruits and vegetables) - (SFA) scores.\nCompared with controls, ischemic stroke patients had a higher SFA score (6.6 +/- 3.0 vs 4.9 +/- 2.7; P < .001), lower scores of MUFA (0.8 +/- 0.9 vs 1.5 +/- 1.2; P < .001), Omega-3 PUFA (1.7 +/- 1.6 vs 2.2 +/- 1.5; P = .013), Omega-6PUFA (2.6 +/- 2.5 vs 3.9 +/- 2.7; P = .002), fruit and vegetables (2.9 +/- 1.7 vs 3.8 +/- 1.6; P = .005), and a lower overall dietary score (-1.2 +/- 5.0 vs 2.5 +/- 4.4; P < .001). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, gender, and smoking status. Ischemic stroke patients with carotid atherosclerosis (n = 54) had a worse overall cardiovascular dietary score than those without (n = 68): -2.2 +/- 4.4 vs -0.2 +/- 5.2; P = .024.\nCompared with controls, ischemic stroke patients, especially those with carotid atherosclerosis, have an unfavorable dietary pattern (high SFA, low fruit and vegetables, and Omega-3 PUFA consumptions) that may have been a facilitating condition of the ischemic stroke. Dietary recommendations of a healthy diet should be useful in ischemic stroke prevention, especially in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to determine the diagnostic value of a juxtaluminal black (hypoechoic) area without a visible echogenic cap (JBA) in ultrasonic images of internal carotid artery plaques.\nUltrasonic images of plaques from 324 patients with asymptomatic (n = 139) and symptomatic (n = 185) internal carotid 50% to 99% stenosis in relation to the bulb (European Carotid Surgery Trial) referred for duplex scanning were studied. The JBA in mm(2) and the gray-scale median (GSM) were obtained after image normalization. Cut-off points for GSM and JBA (combined highest sensitivity with highest specificity) were determined from receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves.\nJBA >or= 8 mm(2) was associated with a high prevalence of symptomatic plaques in all grades of stenosis. In a multiple logistic regression model, increasing stenosis (mild, moderate, severe), GSM <or= 15 and JBA >or= 8 mm(2) were independent predictors of the presence of hemispheric symptoms. This model could identify a high-risk group of 188 plaques that contained 142 (77%) of the 185 symptomatic plaques (odds ratio [OR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.08-10.91), (P < .001), (sensitivity: 77%; specificity 66%; positive predictive value 75%; negative predictive value 68%).\nThe results of this study indicate the diagnostic value and for the first time suggest a cut-off point of 8 mm(2) for JBA. This cut-off point needs to be validated in other groups and then applied to prospective studies of asymptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are exposed to fluid shear stress (FSS) after interventional procedures such as balloon-angioplasty. Whereas the effects of hemodynamic forces on endothelial cells are explored in detail, the influence of FSS on smooth muscle cell function is poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the effect of FSS on SMC gene expression and function.\nLaminar FSS of arterial level (14 dynes/cm(2)) was applied to SMC cultures for 24 hours in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The effect of FSS on gene expression was first screened with microarray technology, and results further verified by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) and caspase-3 protein expression was studied in the rat carotid artery after balloon-injury, and the effect of TFPI-2 on SMC DNA synthesis and apoptosis was examined in vitro.\nMicroarrays identified TFPI-2 as one of the most differentially expressed gene by FSS in cultured SMCs (P < .001). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant regulation of genes linked to proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. TFPI-2 induction was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting demonstrating a more than 400-fold (P < .001) increase in TFPI-2 mRNA in SMCs exposed to FSS compared with static controls, and a consistent protein upregulation. Functionally, SMC proliferation was decreased by FSS (P < .001), and recombinant TFPI-2 was found to inhibit SMC proliferation (P < .001) and induce SMC apoptosis as indicated by activation of caspase-3 (P < .01). In vivo, TFPI-2 expression was found to be upregulated 5, 10, and 20 hours (P < .01) after rat carotid balloon injury, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated TFPI-2 protein in FSS-exposed luminal SMCs, co-localized with caspase-3 in the rat carotid neointima.\nFSS influenced gene expression associated with cell growth and apoptosis in cultured SMCs and strongly induced expression of TFPI-2 mRNA and protein. TFPI-2 was expressed in luminal, FSS-exposed SMCs together with caspase-3 in the rat carotid neointima after balloon injury. Functionally, TFPI-2 may play a role in vessel wall repair by regulating SMC proliferation and survival. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which TFPI-2 controls SMC function.",

    "abstract": "To investigate changes in aortic diameter in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients and the implications for sizing of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with traumatic thoracic aortic injury (TTAI).\nWe retrospectively evaluated all trauma patients that were admitted with hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure <95 mm Hg and a pulse >or=100 beats/min) and underwent computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen both at admission and at another moment (control CT scan), at the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2002 and 2009. The CT examinations were reviewed in a blinded fashion and the aortic diameter was measured at six different levels by a cardiovascular radiologist. Differences in aortic diameter between the initial CTs obtained in the trauma bay and the control CTs were compared using the paired Student t test.\nForty-three patients were identified, including 32 males. Mean age was 37 +/- 16 years, mean injury severity score was 26 +/- 15, the mean pulse and blood pressure were 122 beats/min and 103/63 mm Hg, respectively. Overall, the mean aortic diameter was significantly larger at the control CT examinations compared with the initial CT examinations while hemodynamically unstable, at all evaluated levels. Among patients with a pulse >or=130/min, the mean increase in aortic diameter was most consistent at the level of the mid descending thoracic aorta (DTA, +12.6%, P = .003) and at the level of the infrarenal aorta (+12.6%, P = .004).\nThe aortic diameter decreases dramatically in trauma patients with hemodynamic instability. This decrease in aortic diameter could theoretically lead to inaccurate aortic measurements and undersizing of the endograft in hemodynamically unstable TTAI patients requiring TEVAR. Further research is needed to better predict the actual aortic diameters in individual hemodynamically unstable patients requiring endovascular aortic repair.",

    "abstract": "Persistent type 2 endoleaks (PT2, present >or=6 months) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are associated with adverse outcomes. This study evaluated the preoperative risk factors and natural history of PT2 in order to define a population at high risk.\nFrom January 1999 to December 2007, 595 of 832 EVAR patients had long-term computed tomography follow-up and comprised the study cohort. Preoperative anatomic and clinical variables were correlated with PT2 using Cox regression. Composite hazard ratios (HRs) were constructed with clusters of high-risk preoperative variables. Primary end points, including spontaneous resolution, sac enlargement >5 mm, and freedom from reintervention, were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nThere were 136 PT2 patients (23%) with a median follow-up of 34.8 months (range, 6.4-121.2 months). Positive predictive factors included patent inferior mesenteric artery (IMA; HR, 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-9.90; P = .003), increasing number of patent lumbar arteries (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10-1.41; P = .0006), increasing age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P = .005), and increasing luminal diameter on CT-contrast opacified lumen (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P = .0001). During follow-up, spontaneous PT2 resolution occurred in 34 patients (25%), sac diameter remained stable in 63 (46%), and rupture occurred in 2 (1.5%). Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that 35.2% +/- 5.6% (95% CI, 23.8%-46.2%) of PT2 resolve spontaneously at 5 years after the index procedure. Freedom from sac enlargement >5 mm was 54.6% +/- 7.2% (95% CI, 40.6%-69.4%) at 5 years. Fifty-nine reinterventions were performed in 39 patients with PT2. Freedom from reintervention was 67.3% +/- 5.0% (95% CI, 57.0%-77.0%) at 5 years. The combination of a patent IMA and one risk factor of more than six patent lumbar arteries, maximum luminal diameter >30 mm, or age >70 years increased the odds of PT2 approximately ninefold. The combination of a patent IMA and any two risk factors increased the odds of PT2 approximately 18-fold.\nSeveral readily identifiable preoperative variables are associated with PT2 whose natural history was benign in but 35% of patients. On the basis of the composite high-risk HRs, there is accordingly a cohort of patients in whom perioperative interventions to preclude PT2 should be considered.",

Positive predictive factors included patent inferior mesenteric artery (IMA; HR, 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-9.90; P = .003), increasing number of patent lumbar arteries (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10-1.41; P = .0006), increasing age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P = .005), and increasing luminal diameter on CT-contrast opacified lumen (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P = .0001). During follow-up, spontaneous PT2 resolution occurred in 34 patients (25%), sac diameter remained stable in 63 (46%), and rupture occurred in 2 (1.5%). Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that 35.2% +/- 5.6% (95% CI, 23.8%-46.2%) of PT2 resolve spontaneously at 5 years after the index procedure. Freedom from sac enlargement >5 mm was 54.6% +/- 7.2% (95% CI, 40.6%-69.4%) at 5 years. Fifty-nine reinterventions were performed in 39 patients with PT2. Freedom from reintervention was 67.3% +/- 5.0% (95% CI, 57.0%-77.0%) at 5 years. The combination of a patent IMA and one risk factor of more than six patent lumbar arteries, maximum luminal diameter >30 mm, or age >70 years increased the odds of PT2 approximately ninefold. The combination of a patent IMA and any two risk factors increased the odds of PT2 approximately 18-fold.",

    "abstract": "Several biologic mediators and genetic predisposing factors may contribute to the development of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The eNOS gene, encoding for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, has been proposed as a candidate gene in the predisposition to the disease. In this study, we evaluated the role of eNOS-786T>C, -894G>T and 4a/4b polymorphisms as markers of PAD per se and in the presence of the ACE D allele in patients previously investigated.\nWe analyzed 281 consecutive patients (220 men, 61 women; median age, 72 years) with PAD and 562 healthy controls, comparable for sex and age.\neNOS-786C, but not -894T and 4a, allele frequency was significantly higher in PAD patients than in controls (P = .03). An association with the predisposition to PAD was found for the eNOS-786C allele (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.09; P = .009) and the eNOS -786C/4a haplotype (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.02-1.94, P = .04) at univariate analysis but not after adjustment for traditional risk factors.

The eNOS-786C and eNOS-786C/4a haplotype did not modify the susceptibility to PAD in patients carrying the ACE D allele. Nevertheless, the presence of the eNOS-786C/4a haplotype increased PAD predisposition in smokers also carrying ACE D allele (OR, 2.71 to 3.79; P > .05 for interaction).\nThis study demonstrated an association between eNOS and ACE genes in increasing PAD susceptibility in smokers, thus providing evidence for a gene-environment interaction in modulating predisposition to the disease.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed risk factors for mortality in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), including body mass index (BMI) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Risk factors for long-term survival are unclear in patients with PAD. The origin of the obesity paradox, a paradoxical decrease in mortality with increasing BMI, is also uncertain in these patients.\nA prospective cohort study was performed in 652 patients (aged 71.3 +/- 9.4 years old) with PAD.\nThe 1-, 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates were 94.5%, 70.4%, 45.2%, and 21.1%, respectively, in patients with intermittent claudication, and 72.7%, 27.2%, 11.6%, and 5.8%, respectively, in those with critical limb ischemia (CLI). In Cox multivariate analysis, a significant association with all-cause mortality was found for CLI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.931; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089-3.422; P = .024), diabetes (HR, 2.111; 95% CI, 1.247-3.572; P = .005), BMI (HR, 0.879; 95% CI, 0.804-0.962; P = .005), and eGFR (HR, 0.985; 95% CI, 0.971-0.998l; P = .028). These parameters were also significant risk factors for cardiovascular mortality. Fibrinogen (HR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005; P = .014) and cerebrovascular disease (HR, 1.730; 95% CI, 1.021-2.930; P = .045) were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality. The adjusted HR for mortality of BMI <21.5 vs >or=21.5 kg/m(2) was 1.772 (95% CI, 1.378-2.279; P < .001). BMI had positive correlations with triglyceride and albumin concentrations and negative correlations with the fibrinogen level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .005).\nLow BMI, eGFR, CLI, and diabetes are significant risk factors for mortality in PAD. The obesity paradox was verified and may be partly explained by low BMI mediated by malnutrition and systemic inflammation due to PAD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive long-term outcome data after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are scarce, although anecdotes of endograft failure in the early 1990s abound. The objective of this report is to provide comprehensive outcomes after EVAR performed with the earliest available endograft components. These were a home-made endograft (pre-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] fixed with giant Palmaz stents) and first-generation Talent endografts (World Medical, Sunrise, Fla).\nA prospectively recorded database of all cases undertaken at a tertiary referral center was retrospectively interrogated. Sex, age, types of endograft used, and fate of patient and endografts implanted between 10 and 15 years previously were studied. A literature search was undertaken to obtain data for long-term survival after EVAR and open surgery (OR).\nThere were 50 patients in total operated on between 1994 and 1998 of whom 43 were male. The median age was 73 years (54-93) at time of EVAR and 85 years (67-100) in the survivors at a median of 12 years later. There were 26 home-made (PTFE fixed with Palmaz stents) and 24 Talent endografts (World Medical). Thirty-day mortality was 4%, one death in a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Twenty-one (42%) survived for 12 years to the time of reporting. Of these, 6 have functioning home-made endografts, 8 have Talent endografts, and 8 (5 home-made and 3 Talent) survive after conversion to OR. Secondary interventions took place in 9 further patients. Of 27 late deaths, 1 suffered endograft sepsis, 20 died of cardio-respiratory causes and 6 died of cancer. The only report of more than a 10-year survival after OR was found in an e-publication from Sweden. The projected survival after 10 years was 40% for unruptured aneurysms. However, survival in the general population was higher at 60%.\nTen-year survival after EVAR parallels that of elective OR but is less than the general population. Although the rate of eventual conversion to open repair was high using this earliest available endograft technology, the aneurysm-related mortality was low, and both endografts remain functional for more than 10 years after placement.",

    "abstract": "To establish the relationship between quality of life (QOL) index scores and clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia.\nOne hundred seventy-eight patients (108 men, median age 70 years) with femoropopliteal lesions suitable for angioplasty were recruited. Assessments were performed prior to and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following intervention (angioplasty and/or supervised exercise program). Clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia (treadmill walking distances, ankle pressures), generic (SF36, EuroQol), and disease-specific (Kings College VascuQol) quality of life questionnaires were analyzed. Correlation analysis was performed for index scores (SF-6D, EQ-5D, VascuQol) and individual domain scores using nonparametric tests.\nAll clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia and quality of life index scores showed a statistically significant improvement as result of intervention (Friedman test, P < .001). Both generic QOL index scores (SF-6D, EQ-5D) showed moderate but statistically significant correlation (Spearman's rank correlation, P < .001) with treadmill walking distances (SF-6D r = 0.533, EQ-5D r = 0.500) and weak but significant correlation to resting and postexercise ankle-brachial pressure index (SF-6D r = 0.253, EuroQol r = 0.214). Disease-specific index scores (VascuQol) showed similar moderate correlation to treadmill walking distances (r = 0.584, P < .001) and weak but statistically significant correlation with resting and postexercise ABPI (r = 0.377, P < .001). All index scores showed strong and statistically significant (P< .001) correlation with patient-reported walking distance (SF-6D r = 0.604, EQ-5D r = 0.511, VascuQol r = 0.769). All domains of SF36 showed similar correlation with clinical indicators except general health. The strongest correlation was seen with treadmill walking distances in the domains of physical function (r = 0.538) and bodily pain (r = 0.524).\nAll generic and disease-specific QOL scores show statistically significant improvement with angioplasty and/or supervised exercise in patients with claudication due to femoropopliteal atherosclerosis. However, the degree of improvement seen in clinical indicators of lower limb ischemia is not reflected in these scores. These findings support the use of composite outcome measures with mandatory, independent assessment of QOL as an independent outcome measure in intervention studies in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The present study provides a contemporary and comprehensive summation of midterm patency rates of polyester (Dacron) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in femoropopliteal bypass grafting based on a meta-analysis consisting only of randomized controlled trials.\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify all randomized controlled trials of Dacron vs PTFE grafts in femoropopliteal bypass grafting. Seven trials were found. Survival data were combined to yield the pooled cumulative primary patency. We estimated the log hazard ratio (HR) for each 1-month interval and then combined the HRs in a stratified way across intervals to obtain an overall log HR for each trial. Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic HRs in fixed-effects and random-effects models.\nThe pooled cumulative primary patency of Dacron and PTFE grafts was, respectively, 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56.4%-64.0%) and 53.8% (95% CI, 46.8%-60.9%) at 3 years, and 49.2% (95% CI, 45.6%-52.7%) and 38.4% (95% CI, 32.2%-44.6%) at 5 years. Pooled analysis of the seven trials demonstrated no difference in HR for graft occlusion with Dacron relative to PTFE grafts (random-effects HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67-1.12; P = .27 for effect; P = .03 for heterogeneity).\nEither Dacron or PTFE grafts can be used in femoropopliteal bypass grafting with no significant differences in midterm graft patency at 5 years (49.2% vs 38.4%) when the autologous saphenous vein is unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Whether novel biomarkers improve risk prediction of mortality beyond standard cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients, and whether any such prediction differs with length of follow-up, remains controversial. Our objective was to determine in patients with PAD whether novel biomarkers improve prediction of CVD mortality and total mortality.\nA cohort of 397 patients who were referred to a vascular lab had PAD diagnosed by noninvasive testing. Fifty-eight percent also had coronary or cerebrovascular disease at baseline. Predictors of total, CVD, and non-CVD mortality were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models, and the incremental value of predictors was evaluated with both the C-statistic and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index.\nTotal mortality was 11% at 2-year follow-up and 65% at an average of 6.6-year of follow-up (maximum, 11.4 years). At 2 years, hs-CRP was a strong and significant predictor of mortality, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.56 per standard deviation (P = .006). However, at full follow up, standard CVD risk markers were significant (age, gender, ankle-brachial index, other CVD, and hypertension), but hs-CRP no longer showed a significant relationship (HR 1.12; P = .11). None of the other biomarkers studied showed a significant independent association with mortality. Hs-CRP improved the C-statistic and the IDI beyond standard risk markers at 2 years, but not at full follow-up.\nhs-CRP was a strong predictor of short-term mortality in this cohort of PAD patients, while standard risk markers were better at predicting longer-term mortality.",

    "abstract": "Efficacy results of endovascular repair (rEVAR) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) compared with open surgery are based on several observational studies containing selection bias. The present study compared rEVAR with open surgery in EVAR-suitable patients with an rAAA who all underwent the same preoperative imaging protocol.\nOur policy is to perform a computed tomography angiography on all patients with a suspected rAAA. rEVAR was performed when the rEVAR-vascular surgeon was on call and the patient was suitable for EVAR. Afterwards, two experienced independent blinded experts assessed all computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans on EVAR-suitability. Only EVAR-suitable patients were included in the main analyses. Outcome parameters included mortality (intraoperative, 30-day, and 6-month), complications, reinterventions, and length of hospital stay.\nFrom April 2002 until March 2008, 132 consecutive patients with suspected rAAAs were presented. Preoperative CTA confirmed rAAA in 104 patients, of whom 25 underwent rEVAR, and 79 underwent open surgery. In retrospect, the 25 rEVAR patients and 33 patients in the open group were judged EVAR-suitable by the experts. At baseline, there was an equal distribution of physiologic and anatomic characteristics as well as comorbidity. In EVAR-suitable patients, the intraoperative, 30-day, and 6-month mortality was 4.0% (1 of 25), 20.0% (5 of 25), and 28.0% (7 of 25) after rEVAR compared with 6.1% (2 of 33; P >.99), 45.5% (15 of 33; P = .04), and 54.5% (18 of 33; P = .04) after open surgery, respectively. Median length of hospital stay was 9.5 days (interquartile range, 5.0-20.5) after rEVAR and 17.0 days (interquartile range, 9.5-28.0) after open surgery (P = .03).\nIn EVAR-suitable patients, an absolute perioperative mortality reduction of 25.5% of rEVAR over open surgery was found, which was still present at 6 months of follow-up. These data suggest that rEVAR is a superior treatment option for EVAR-suitable patients with an rAAA compared with an open surgery.",

    "abstract": "Selective tibial revascularization refers to the practice of vessel repair vs ligation or observation based on factors observed at the time of injury. Although commonly employed, the effectiveness of this strategy and its impact on sustained limb salvage is unknown. The objective of this study is to define the factors most relevant in selective tibial artery revascularization and to characterize limb salvage following tibial-level vascular injury.\nThe cohort of active-duty military patients undergoing infrapopliteal artery repair comprises the tibial Bypass group. A similarly injured cohort of patients that did not undergo operative vascular intervention (No Bypass group) was identified. All tibial vessel injuries were documented by angiography. Data were compiled via medical records and patient interview. The primary outcome measure was failure of limb salvage. Multivariate regression was performed to identify factors associated with revascularization and to describe factors associated with amputation.\nBetween March 2003 and September 2008, 135 of 1332 patients with battle-related vascular injuries had documented tibial vessel disruption or occlusion. Of these, 104 were included for analysis. Twenty-one underwent autologous vein bypass at the time of injury (Bypass group), and the remaining 83 patients were managed without revascularization (No Bypass group). Mean follow-up (39 vs 41 months; P = .27), age (25 vs 27 years; P = .66), and mechanism of injury (88% vs 92% penetrating blast; P = .56) were similar, but the No Bypass group had higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS; 16.3 vs 11.7; P < .01). Injury characteristics, including Gustilo III classification (49% vs 43%; P = .81) and nerve injury (55% vs 53%; P = 1.0), were similar. Subjects were more likely to receive tibial bypass with an increasing number of tibial vessel occlusions and documented ischemia on initial exam. However, of the 23 in the No Bypass group with initially unobtainable Doppler signals, 17 (74%) regained pedal flow following resuscitation and limb stabilization. Amputation rates were similar (23% vs 19%; P = .79), but the prevalence of chronic limb pain was lower in the Bypass group (10% vs 30%, respectively; P = .08). Cox regression analysis of amputation-free survival demonstrated an association between mangled extremity severity score >5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; P = .01) and amputation.\nThis report provides outcomes data for wartime tibial vascular injury, which supports a selective approach to tibial artery revascularization. Clinical factors such as ISS and degree of ischemia guide which patients are best suited for tibial vascular repair, while injury-specific characteristics are associated with amputation regardless of revascularization status.",

    "abstract": "Operative mortality of patients undergoing symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (Sx-AAA) repair has been reported at 6% to 30% during the past 25 years. We used a multicenter regional database to describe the contemporary outcomes of patients undergoing repair of Sx-AAA.\nAll patients undergoing infrarenal AAA repair in 11 hospitals comprising the Vascular Study Group of Northern New England (VSGNNE) between 2003 and 2009 were studied. Sx-AAA was prospectively defined as an AAA accompanied by abdominal or back pain or tenderness, but without rupture. The primary study end point was in-hospital mortality. Secondary end points included in-hospital postoperative major adverse events (MAE) and late survival. These outcomes were compared between symptomatic patients and contemporary VSGNNE cohorts of elective (E-AAA) and ruptured AAAs (R-AAAs) treated within the same study period.\nDuring the study period, 2386 AAA repairs were performed, comprising 1959 (82%) E-AAAs, 156 (7%) Sx-AAAs, and 271 (11%) R-AAAs. Repair was endovascular in 945 (48%) E-AAAs, 60 (38%) Sx-AAAs, and 33 (12%) R-AAAs. Hospital mortality was 1.7% for E-AAA repair and 1.3% for Sx-AAA repair, but was 34.7% for R-AAA repair (P < .001). The MAE rates were 20%, 35%, and 63%, respectively, for E-AAA, Sx-AAA, and R-AAA repairs (P < .001). The mean Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) for Sx-AAA patients who survived was 79 +/- 12. Those who died had an average score of 92 +/- 7, and 83% of all Sx-AAA and R-AAA patients who died had a GAS >85. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that at 1 and 4 years, Sx-AAA repair was associated with intermediate survival (83% and 68%) compared with E-AAA repair (89% and 73%) and R-AAA repair (49% and 35%; P < .001).\nThe operative mortality of patients with Sx-AAA in contemporary practice appears better than that previously reported in the literature. Despite low operative mortality, MAE and late survival are intermediate compared with E-AAA and R-AAA repair. Review of previous series shows a trend for lower operative mortality after Sx-AAA repair in more recent series, which likely reflects improved perioperative care and more use of endovascular aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, endovascular repair (EV) has replaced open surgical repair (OSR) as the preferred method of treatment of blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs) at many trauma centers. This has resulted in reductions in mortality, length of stay, and major complications, including paraplegia, with the added expense of the initial endograft, subsequent surveillance, and reinterventions. The purpose of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation comparing these two methods of repair.\nWe performed an economic comparison of EV and OSR for the treatment of BTAI using a decision tree analysis with transition points derived from our institution's experience and through a review of the literature. Over a 15-year period (1991-2006), 28 patients with BTAI were treated at our center (15 EV, 13 OSR). Costs were obtained from our hospital's case costing center, the Ontario Case Costing Initiative, Ontario's Drug Benefit Formulary, and Ontario's Schedule of Benefits for physician costs. Our center's results were then combined with those from the literature to arrive at an economic model.\nThese combined results revealed that EV, when compared to OSR, resulted in decreased early mortality (7.2% vs 22.5%), decreased composite outcome of mortality and paraplegia (7.7% vs 27.6%) and decreased composite outcome of mortality and major complication (42.5% vs 69.8%). Patients undergoing EV also had shorter intensive care unit stays (12.2 vs 15.3 days), total hospital length of stays (22.5 vs 28.6 days), and ventilator days (8.0 vs 9.2 days). Additionally, patients undergoing EV had decreased total 1-year costs compared with OSR ($70,442 vs $72,833).\nEV repair of BTAIs offers a survival advantage as well as a reduction in major morbidity, including paraplegia, compared with OSR, and results in a reduction in costs at 1 year. As a result, from the cost-effectiveness point of view, EV is the DOMINANT therapy over OSR for these injuries.",

Inhibition of angiogenesis results in attenuation of experimental aneurysms. This study investigated the effects of recombinant human (rh)VEGF on experimental aneurysms.\nApolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice were assigned to one of four groups: (1) normal saline infusion (sham), (2) angiotensin-II (AngII) infusion, (3) AngII infusion plus 100 microg daily rhVEGF for 14 days (AngII+14dVEGF), or (4) AngII infusion plus 100 microg daily rhVEGF for 21 days (AngII+21dVEGF). Aortic maximum diameter and cross-sectional area were determined by magnetic resonance imaging and microscopy. All mice were sacrificed at day 28.\nAneurysms developed in all mice in the AngII+14dVEGF and AngII+21dVEGF groups by day 21 compared with 40% in the AngII group. Treatment with rhVEGF increased maximum aortic diameter (P < .002) and cross-sectional area of aneurysms (P < .005) at day 21. This effect was maintained at day 28 (P < .0005). Decreasing rhVEGF treatment from 21 to 14 days did not attenuate aneurysm formation. Treatment with rhVEGF upregulated matrix metalloproteinase 2 gene expression within the aortic wall (P < .0009).\nTreatment with rhVEGF intensified the formation of AngII-induced aneurysms. Further studies are needed to investigate if antiangiogenic therapy may be a valid medical therapy against aneurysm expansion or rupture.",

    "abstract": "Small-diameter veins are often a limiting factor for the successful creation of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). This study evaluated the use of intraoperative primary balloon angioplasty (PBA) as a technique to upgrade small-diameter veins during AVF creation. Sequential balloon angioplasty maturation (BAM) was evaluated as a technique to salvage failed fistulas, expedite maturation, and improve the patency of AVFs after PBA.\nSixty-two PBAs were performed in 55 patients with an intent-to-treat using an all-autologous policy. PBAs of veins were performed just before AVF creation using 2.5- to 4-mm angioplasty balloons (1- to 1.5-mm larger than the nominal vein diameter). PBAs were performed through the spatulated end of the vein for a length of up to 8 cm using hydrophilic guidewires and hand inflations without fluoroscopy. BAM was performed in 53 of the 62 PBAs at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the PBA. Successful outcome was determined as the functional ability to use the fistula for hemodialysis without surgical revision.\nOf the 62 PBAs, 53 (85.4%), comprising 47 of the original AVFs and 6 new site AVFs created at other sites, remained patent and subsequently underwent BAM with a resulting functional AVF. Fifteen of the 47 original AVFs: 14 due to occlusion; one AVF with a steal was ligated. Seven of the 14 fistulas that occluded were salvaged using recanalization techniques during sequential BAMs. Two of the seven fistulas that were not salvaged required AVGs (3%), and five patients underwent redo AVFs using alternative veins. These five cases were also performed using PBAs and BAMs technique. One patient with a functioning fistula underwent intentional ligation for steal syndrome and also underwent an alternative site AVF, PBA, and BAM. At 3 months, 53 AVFs were functional and successfully used for dialysis. Overall, a working AVF was obtained at the initial site in 47 of 55 patients (85.4%), and 53 (96.3%) received working AVFs that were functioning for dialysis access.\nSmall or suboptimal veins can undergo PBA and then be matured to create functioning AVFs <or=2 months. Overall, >90% autogenous AVF rates can be achieved using PBA and BAM. BAM can be successfully used to mature AVFs created from small veins and salvage thrombosed AVFs in many cases. The use of these techniques may decrease the number of patients requiring AVGs and indwelling catheters.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injuries (BTAI) has become routine at many trauma centers despite concerns regarding durability and aortic dilatation in these predominantly young patients. These concerns prompted this examination of thoracic aortic expansion after endovascular repair of a BTAI.\nThe immediate postoperative and most recent computed tomography (CT) scans of patients who had undergone urgent endovascular repair of a BTAI and had at least 1 year of follow-up were reviewed. Diameter measurements were made at four predetermined sites: immediately proximal to the left subclavian artery (D1), immediately distal to the left subclavian artery (D2), distal extent of the endograft (D3), and 15 mm beyond the distal end of the endograft (D4). Split screens permitted direct comparison of measurements between CTs at the corresponding levels.\nDuring a 6-year period (2001-2007), 21 patients (mean age, 42.9 years; range, 19-81 years) underwent endovascular repair of a BTAI, 17 with at least 1 year of follow-up (mean, 2.6 years; range, 1-5.5 years). No patients required reintervention during this period. The mean rate of dilatation for each level of the thoracic aorta in mm/year was: D1, 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-1.06); D2, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.55-1.11); D3, 0.63 (95% CI, 0.37-0.89); D4, 0.47 (95% CI, 0.27-0.67). The rate of expansion of D2 differed significantly vs D4 (P = .025).\nDuring the first several years of follow-up, the proximal thoracic aorta dilates minimally after endovascular repair of BTAIs, with the segment just distal to the left subclavian artery expanding at a slightly greater rate. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to determine whether this expansion continues and becomes clinically significant.",

    "abstract": "Improving the safety of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has become an imperative. Five well-described risk-scoring systems developed on open aneurysm repair (OR) were tested on a multicenter contemporary sample of patients undergoing endovascular repair of AAA (EVR) to determine if they predicted 30-day morbidity and mortality.\nThe Glasgow score (GAS), combined prognostic index (CPI), and its modification (M-CPI), the Leiden score and the Vascular Biochemical and Haematological Outctome Model (VBHOM) score were studied using a retrospective database of 846 patients. Thirty-day mortality and serious morbidity were used as end-points. A receiver-operator characteristic curves was plotted and the area under this (known as the c-statistic) was calculated to determine discriminatory ability of each model.\nIncidence of postoperative mortality was 2.2% and serious morbidity was 12.3%. All scores were predictive of mortality except the Leiden score, which had a c-statistic of 0.603 (95% CI, 0.485-0.720; P = .123). The VBHOM score and the M-CPI had a c-statistic of 0.649 (95% CI, 0.514 -0.783; P = .026) and 0.653 (95% CI, 0.544-0.763; P = .026), respectively. The best performing scores were the GAS and CPI, which had a c-statistic of 0.677 (95% CI, 0.559-0.795; P = .008) and 0.679 (95% CI, 0.572-0.787; P = .007), respectively. No score effectively predicted morbidity.\nNone of the available scores predicted the outcome of EVR with enough accuracy to be recommended for clinical use. To improve preoperative risk prediction in EVR validation of new systems is required, taking into account morphologic features of the aneurysm to predict medium-term morbidity and re-intervention.",

    "abstract": "While much attention has been devoted toward treatment paradigms for idiopathic axillo-subclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT), little has focused on long-term durability of aggressive treatment and its associated functional outcomes. The purpose of this study was to review our own surgical therapeutic algorithm and its associated durability and functional outcomes.\nAll patients treated with combined endovascular and open surgery at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center for ASVT from 1988 to 2008 were identified. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and operative techniques were recorded. Patency, freedom from reintervention, and functional outcomes were documented. Follow-up via telephone and clinic visit allowed quantitative comparison of functional status, pre- and postoperatively.\nThirty-six patients were treated for ASVT throughout the study interval. Seven patients (19.4%) were lost to follow-up. Most patients were male (66%; N = 24); mean age was 32 years. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was utilized in the majority of patients (83.3%; N = 30) with an average time from symptom onset to lysis of 12 days. Surgical decompression was undertaken in all patients via transaxillary (52%; N = 19), supraclavicular (31%; N = 11), or infraclavicular approaches (17%; N = 6). Eleven stents were placed in 11 patients (30.5%) for residual stenotic disease. Mean follow-up was 65 months, with 1- and 5-year overall patency at 100% and 94%, respectively. Freedom from reintervention was 100% and 74.4% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Seven patients (19.4%) required postoperative reintervention with four receiving additional lytic therapy, two requiring a stent, and one venoplasty. At presentation, 65.5% (N = 19) of patients were unable to work or perform routine activities. After treatment, 86% (N = 25) returned to their employment and have experienced sustained symptomatic and functional improvement.\nPatients with symptomatic idiopathic axillo-subclavian vein thrombosis can expect durable patency with sustained freedom from reintervention following aggressive combined endovascular and surgical treatment. Good functional outcomes can be expected in patients with relief of symptoms and return to work.",

Villalta scores were assessed on four consecutive visits; 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the acute event. Reflux was assessed once by duplex testing. After 6 months, patients with scores <or=4 on the Villalta clinical score and in the absence of reflux were allowed to discontinue ECS therapy.

Varicosities/venous insufficiency (present at baseline) was significantly associated with PTS; hazard ratio 3.2 (1.2-9.1).\nPatients with a low probability for developing PTS can be identified as early as 6 months after the thrombotic event, and individualized shortened duration of ECS therapy based on Villalta clinical scores may be a safe management option. These findings need to be confirmed in a randomized clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent programmed compression of the chronically ischemic limb is associated with arteriogenesis. However, progenitor cell elements contributing to this neovascularization are typically diminished in number and function in the elderly dysvascular patient, particularly in the presence of diabetes, renal insufficiency, and cardiac disease. Granulocyte-colony stimulation factor (G-CSF) dramatically boosts the circulating progenitor cell count. G-CSF was administered in 2 patients being treated for ischemic wounds with an intermittent programmed pneumatic compression device (PPCD). Both had comorbidities associated with diminished circulating progenitor cell counts. Remarkable clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic improvement was observed. Further study of this synergistic strategy is warranted.",

    "abstract": "One of the major concerns in the long-term success of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is stent graft migration, which can cause type I endoleak and even aneurysm rupture. Fixation depends on the mechanical forces between the graft and both the aortic neck and the blood flow. Therefore, there are anatomical restrictions for EVAR, such as short and angulated necks. To improve the fixation of EVAR grafts, elastomer (PDMS) can be injected in the aneurysm sac. The support given by the elastomer might prevent dislocation and migration of the graft. The aim of this study was to measure the influence of an injectable biocompatible elastomer on the fixation strength of different EVAR grafts in an in vitro model.\nThe proximal part of three different stent grafts was inserted in a bovine artery with an attached latex aneurysm. The graft was connected to a tensile testing machine, applying force to the proximal fixation, while the artery with the aneurysm was fixated to the setup. The force to obtain graft dislodgement (DF) from the aorta was recorded in Newtons (N). Three different proximal seal lengths (5, 10, and 15 mm) were evaluated. The experiments were repeated after the space between the graft and the latex aneurysm was filled with the elastomer. Independent sample ttests were used for the comparison between the DF before and after elastomer treatment for each seal length.\nThe mean DF (mean +/- SD) of all grafts without elastomer sac filling for a proximal seal length of 5, 10, and 15 mm were respectively, 4.4 +/- 3.1 N, 12.2 +/- 10.6 N, and 15.1 +/- 6.9 N. After elastomer sac filling, the dislodgement forces increased significantly (P < .001) to 20.9 +/- 3.8 N, 31.8 +/- 9.8 N, and 36.0 +/- 14.1 N, respectively.\nThe present study shows that aneurysm sac filling may have a role as an adjuvant procedure to the present EVAR technique. The strength of the proximal fixation of three different stent grafts increases significantly in this in vitro setting. Further in vivo research must be done to see if this could facilitate the treatment of aneurysms with short infrarenal necks.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been repeatedly described as a safe and efficacious procedure to provide a stroke-risk reduction benefit in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Contemporary outcomes are acceptable using the large-scale randomized trials as a metric of success. Class I and II data can be applied to improve the care process of patients undergoing CEA. Myocardial infarction remains the most significant nonstroke complication; however, there is no significant benefit to noninvasive stress testing in patients with clinically stable disease. Perioperative beta-blockade may offer up to a 10-fold reduction in the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction, but deleterious effects are attributable to high-dose regimens. Angiotensin blockade has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with atherosclerosis by up to 25%, although few studies have examined these agents directly in carotid surgery patients. Statins are beneficial to patients undergoing CEA with trials demonstrating up to a 3% absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke following CEA. Aspirin therapy is associated with an up to 7% absolute reduction in early stroke following CEA; however, the efficacy of combination or high-dose antiplatelet therapy remains ill-defined. A treatment strategy that involves perioperative medical optimization is likely to improve surgical outcomes and long-term cardiovascular risk for patients undergoing CEA.",

    "abstract": "The development of an ideal small-diameter conduit for use in vascular bypass surgery has yet to be achieved. The ongoing innovation in biomaterial design generates novel conduits that require preclinical assessment in vivo, and a number of animal models have been used for this purpose. This article examines the rationale behind animal models used in the assessment of small-diameter vascular conduits encompassing the commonly used species: baboons, sheep, pigs, dogs, rabbits, and rodents. Studies on the comparative hematology for these species relative to humans are summarized, and the hydrodynamic values for common implant locations are also compared. The large- and small-animal models are then explored, highlighting the characteristics of each that determine their relative utility in the assessment of vascular conduits. Where possible, the performance of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene is given in each animal and in each location to allow direct comparisons between species. New challenges in animal modeling are outlined for the assessment of tissue-engineered graft designs. Finally, recommendations are given for the selection of animal models for the assessment of future vascular conduits.",

    "abstract": "Few previous studies have focused on the involvement of the lymphatic system in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), although some evidence suggests that lymphatic abnormalities are associated with the disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of the lymphatic system in KTS.\nMagnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) with the use of gadobenate dimeglumine as the contrast was performed on 32 patients with KTS involving the extremities to evaluate lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and veins.\nThirty-one of 32 patients exhibited lymphatic vessel and/or lymph node anomalies, including hyperplasia (11/31), hypoplasia or aplasia (20/31) of lymphatic vessels, and lymphedema (31/31) of the affected limbs. Twenty-two patients showed asymmetry of the inguinal nodes exhibiting either the absence, or an increase or a decrease in number and size of the inguinal nodes. Venous dysplasia was found in 31 patients in superficial and/or deep veins. The results showed a high concomitance of malformations of the lymphatic system and veins in the affected limbs of patients with KTS.\nLymphatic system abnormalities as examined with MRL are commonly associated with KTS and are likely to play a significant role in the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Stent graft-induced new entry (SINE), defined as the new tear caused by the stent graft and excluding those arising from natural disease progression or iatrogenic injury from the endovascular manipulation, has been increasingly observed after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for Stanford type B dissection in our center. SINE appears to be remarkably life threatening. We investigated the incidence, mortality, causes, and preventions of SINE after TEVAR for Stanford type B dissection.\nData for 22 patients with SINE were retrospectively collected and analyzed from 650 patients undergoing TEVAR for type B dissection from August 2000 to June 2008. An additional patient was referred to our center 14 months after TEVAR was performed in another hospital. The potential associations of SINE with Marfan syndrome, location of SINE and endograft placement, and the oversizing rate were analyzed by Fisher exact probability test or t test.\nWe found 24 SINE tears in 23 patients, including SINE at the proximal end of the endograft in 15, at the distal end in 7, and at both ends in 1. Six patients died. SINE incidence and mortality reached 3.4% and 26.1%, respectively. Two SINE patients were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, whereas there were only 6 Marfan patients among the 651 patients. The 16 proximal SINEs were evidenced at the greater curve of the arch and caused retrograde type A dissection. The eight distal SINEs occurred at the dissected flap, and five caused enlarging aneurysm whereas three remained stable. The endograft was placed across the distal aortic arch during the primary TEVAR in all 23 patients. The incidence of SINE was 33.33% among Marfan patients vs 3.26% among non-Marfan patients (P = .016). There was no significant difference in mortality between proximal and distal SINE (25% vs 28.6%, P > .99), incidence of SINE between endograft placement across the arch and at the straight portion of descending thoracic aorta (23 of 613 vs 0 of 38, P = .39), and the oversizing rate between SINE and non-SINE patients (13% \u00b1 4.5% vs 16% \u00b1 6.5%, P = .98).\nSINE appears not to be rare after TEVAR for type B dissection and is associated with substantial mortality. The stress yielded by the endograft seems to play a predominant role in its occurrence. It is important to take this stress-induced injury into account during both design and placement of the endograft.",

    "abstract": "American and European guidelines recommend the distal radial-cephalic fistula (dRCF) as the first and best hemodialysis access in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, this kind of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) shows a limited primary unassisted patency and frequently needs surgical revisions or angiographic procedures, or both. When dRCF is not feasible, guidelines suggest a proximal brachiocephalic AVF. The middle-arm fistula (MAF), or autogenous forearm radial-median direct access, has been suggested as a possible alternative approach. This study evaluated MAF primary unassisted patency, the most frequent causes of MAF failure, and the possible related factors.\nData on patients with a MAF placed from January 1991 until June 2008 were retrospectively collected. The probability of MAF failure overall and by the main subgroups was estimated according to Kaplan-Meier with Greenwood standard error (SE). Comparison of failure among different subgroups was performed using the log rank test in univariate analyses. The Cox regression model was used to investigate factors that independently affected the overall hazard of failure and cause-specific hazard of thrombosis.\nAt the end of follow-up, 14.0% of MAF failed (11.6% thrombosis, 1.7% stenosis, 0.7% failed maturation), and 44.2% of MAF were still working. Cumulative probability of MAF unassisted primary patency after 4 years from the creation was 79%. Univariate analyses highlighted that women (P = .019), underweight patients (P = .010), and MAF implantation after starting hemodialysis (P < .001) had a higher risk of MAF failure for any cause than men, normal and overweight patients, and MAF implanted before starting hemodialysis. Results of the Cox multivariate analysis for overall MAF failure confirmed that only MAF implantation before starting hemodialysis is a protective factor against any failure (P = .003), whereas female gender (P = .016) was associated with an increase of the thrombosis hazard ratio to 2.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.63).\nOur data demonstrate that MAF has a good unassisted primary patency and suggest that this kind of AVF could be a valuable alternative surgical approach when dRCF is not feasible in ESRD patients.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of once-daily enoxaparin plus warfarin for the outpatient ambulatory treatment of lower-limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT).\nA total of 246 patients, comprising 128 men (mean age, 54.28\u00b116.48 years) and 118 women (mean age, 50.11\u00b116.47 years) with symptomatic lower extremity DVT, were included in this open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase IV clinical trial conducted at 14 centers in Turkey. All patients were administered subcutaneous enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg, once-daily) until international normalized ratio (INR) levels reached to 2 to 3, followed by oral warfarin (5 mg/d) for at least 3 months and elastic compression stockings (30-40 mm Hg). Clinical signs (leg circumference), symptoms (edema, pain, tenderness), recanalization rates upon duplex ultrasound examination, laboratory findings (D-dimer and INR levels), and postthrombotic syndrome status with CEAP classification were the efficacy parameters evaluated every 3 months during 18 months of follow-up. Safety end points included minor and major bleeding as well as serious adverse events.\nAmbulatory treatment with enoxaparin plus warfarin significantly reduced physical symptoms, including tenderness, edema, pain (P<.001), and the circumference of the affected leg (P<.001). The leg circumference difference in almost all patients was <1.5 cm at the end of 18 months (P<.001). Recanalization rates for occluded iliofemoral vein were 76.1% at 3 months and 86.5% at 18 months (P<.001). An early and significant decrease obtained in D-dimer levels on day 10 continued to decline significantly until month 6 and remained unchanged afterwards (P<.001). Of four patients diagnosed with major bleeding during oral anticoagulant use, three recovered with conservative treatment (reduction in hemoglobin levels in 2 developed at visit 2 [day 10] and intracranial bleeding in 1 developed at visit 3 [day 30]), and one patient required a hysterectomy after menorrhagia developed at visit 7 (month 18). Two of the 65 (9.9%) adverse events documented were serious adverse events, but none of the serious adverse events leading to death were related to the study medications.\nAmbulatory treatment with enoxaparin plus warfarin seems to be effective in symptomatic healing and in clinical improvement by reducing thrombus formation and organization at all levels of lower extremity venous system with DVT, without a significant major bleeding risk. Therefore, the results of our conventional conservative treatment are in line with 1A level evidence reported in the recent American College of Chest Physicians guideline.",

An early and significant decrease obtained in D-dimer levels on day 10 continued to decline significantly until month 6 and remained unchanged afterwards (P<.001). Of four patients diagnosed with major bleeding during oral anticoagulant use, three recovered with conservative treatment (reduction in hemoglobin levels in 2 developed at visit 2 [day 10] and intracranial bleeding in 1 developed at visit 3 [day 30]), and one patient required a hysterectomy after menorrhagia developed at visit 7 (month 18). Two of the 65 (9.9%) adverse events documented were serious adverse events, but none of the serious adverse events leading to death were related to the study medications.",

    "abstract": "To examine and report surgical results from a contemporary experience of open abdominal aortic reconstruction in patients with chronic atherosclerotic abdominal aortic occlusion (CAAAO).\nBetween January 1999 through May 2010, 54 patients with CAAAO were identified and retrospectively reviewed. CAAAOs were categorized into infrarenal aortic occlusions (IRAOs) and juxtarenal aortic occlusions (JRAOs) based on superior extension of thrombus and requirement for supra-renal aortic clamping to repair. Morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, and operative variables were assessed. The \u03c72 or Fisher test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare demographic and operative variables between two aortic occlusion groups (IRAO and JRAO). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess factors associated with surgical outcomes and hospital stay. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival and patency rates.\nFifty patients underwent aortic reconstructions with aorto-bifemoral or iliac bypass, and three underwent a remote axillo-femoral bypass procedure. There were 35 (64.8%) males, and 19 (35.2%) females. Median age was 51.9 years (range, 32-72 years). Of the two CAAAO groups, there were 20 IRAOs and 33 JRAOs. Aorto-renal thromboendartectomy was performed in 26 (49.1%) patients; 26 (75.8%) among JRAOs versus 1 (5%) of IRAOs (P<.01). Proximal aortic clamps were required in 28 (85%) of JRAOs and 3 (15%) of IRAOs (P<.01). Thirty-day and in-hospital mortality was zero. Median length of hospital stay was 7 days (range, 4 to 66 days), and median intensive care unit length of stay was 3 days (range, 1-22 days). Complications included cardiopulmonary dysfunction in four (8%), postoperative renal insufficiency in 10 (18.9%), and other postoperative complications in 15 (28.3%). All 10 with renal insufficiency recovered renal function to baseline creatinine or a creatinine value<1.1 mg/dL. Mean increases in right and left ankle-brachial indicess were 0.54\u00b10.25 and 0.59\u00b10.22, respectively. On univariate analysis, coronary artery disease and African American race were predictors of postoperative complications (P=.048). Age was significantly associated with total complications. Patients with postoperative complications and/or renal insufficiency were older than those without such complications (P=.02) Independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay were intraoperative blood replacement (P=.003), postoperative complications (P<.01), and postoperative renal insufficiency (P<.01). Prolonged intensive care unit stay was predicted by JRAO (P=.04), postoperative complications (P=.02), and postoperative renal insufficiency (P=.013). Survival at 3, 5, and 7 years were 86.6%, 76.5% and 50.9%, respectively. The reduced survival rates were predicted by previous myocardial infarction and existing coronary artery disease (P<.01).\nAbdominal aortic reconstruction is a safe method for treating CAAAO with low associated morbidity and mortality. Aorto-renal thromboendartectomy with supra-renal aortic clamping and aortic replacement remains an effective treatment for those with significant pararenal aortic disease, and can be performed without significant renal impairment.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) in the lower extremity represent a useful alternative for hemodialysis vascular access when all upper limb access sites have been used or in some patients when freedom of both hands is necessary during dialysis. Reported complications include an increased risk of infection and limb ischemia. This study evaluated our experience with the patency outcomes and complication rates of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) AVGs placed in the thigh.\nA retrospective outcomes analysis was performed of all femoral AVGs inserted between January 1992 and July 2007. Data were obtained by review of medical records for patient demographics, comorbidities, and AVG-related outcomes. Patency, complication rates, and risk factors for infection were determined.\nA total of 153 prosthetic AVGs were placed in 127 patients (63 men). Mean patient age was 52.7 \u00b1 16.3 years. Median follow-up was 25 months (range, 1-169 months). The most common underlying renal disease was glomerulonephritis in 27 (21%). Hypertension and coronary artery disease were common comorbidities, respectively, in 49 (39%) and 23 patients (18%). The primary and secondary AVG patency rates at 12 months were 53.9% and 75.3%, respectively, and 2- and 5-year patency rates were, respectively, 39.6% and 19.3% (primary) and 63.8% and 50.6% (secondary). The mean AVG survival for all cases was 31.6 months (range, 0-149 months). Surgical thrombectomy was required in 82 (54%), and 22 AVGs (14%) required surgical revision for stenosis. Infection occurred in 41 AVGs (27%), and limb ischemia occurred in 2 (1.3%). Statistical analysis did not reveal a significant risk factor for infection.\nFemoral AVGs are a suitable alternative to upper limb vascular access, with acceptable primary and secondary patency rates.

    "abstract": "Improvements in endovascular technology and techniques have allowed us to treat patients in ways we never thought possible. Today, endovascular treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is associated with markedly decreased morbidity and mortality compared with the open surgical approach, yet there are several fundamental obstacles in our ability to offer these endovascular techniques to most patients with ruptured aneurysms. This article will focus on the technical aspects of endovascular aneurysm repair for rupture, with particular attention to developing a standardized multidisciplinary approach that will help vascular surgeons deal with not just the technical aspects of these procedures but also address some of the challenges, including the availability of preoperative computed tomography, the choice of anesthesia, the percutaneous vs femoral cutdown approach, use of aortic occlusion balloons, need for bifurcated vs aortouniiliac stent grafts, need for adjunctive procedures, diagnosis and treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome, and conversion to open surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the outcomes of secondary procedures after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nFrom 2002 to 2009, 1768 patients underwent EVAR for treatment of 1662 elective (94%) and 106 emergent (6%) infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a variety of Food and Drug Administration-approved and commercially available stent grafts. Postoperative follow-up included clinical examination, pulse volume recording, duplex ultrasound imaging, and computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Patients with type I and III endoleaks, unexplained endotension, limb occlusion, stent graft migration, with and without type I endoleak, and aneurysm rupture underwent secondary interventions. Type II endoleak at >6 months without a decrease in the aneurysm sac underwent translumbar embolization. Data were prospectively collected.\nEVAR was performed in 1768 patients. During a mean follow-up of 34 (SD, 30.03) months, 339 patients (19.2%) required additional secondary procedures for aneurysm-related complications, including type I (n = 51, 15.0%), type II (n = 136, 40.1%), and type III (n = 5, 1.5%) endoleaks; endotension (n = 8, 2.4%), stent graft migration proximal fixation site (n = 46, 13.6%), stent graft iliac limb thrombosis or stenosis (n = 25, 7.4%), subsequent iliac aneurysm formation (n = 39, 11.5%), or aneurysm rupture after EVAR (n = 29, 8.6%). The mean age was 74 (SD, 9.15) years. Mean AAA size was 5.7 (SD 3.24) cm. Compared with secondary procedures for AAA rupture, the nonrupture patients had a significantly lower mortality (1.6% vs 17.2%, P < .05) and a higher likelihood of being managed by endovascular means (98.8% vs 44.8%, P < .05). When nonruptured EVAR patients required urgent secondary procedures for type I endoleaks and stent graft migration or limb thrombosis, the mortality was 6.0% vs 0.5% for elective procedures (P < .05).\nOur long-term EVAR experience indicates that 18% of patients require additional secondary procedures, and most of these patients can be managed by endovascular means with an acceptable overall mortality of 2.9%. Most type I and II endoleaks can be successfully treated by transluminal embolization, and most patients with delayed aneurysm rupture after EVAR can be successfully managed by endovascular or open surgical repair.",

The hypoxic status was investigated by means of HIF-1\u03b1 expression in carotid specimens.\nHIF-1\u03b1 was significantly upregulated in carotid specimens with respect to controls (P < .05), ASK-1 was detected in plaques of any composition from lipidic to calcific, and this expression increased with the stage of the plaque and with the expression of inflammatory (p-ERK, RANK-L, OPG) and apoptotic molecules (caspase 9, p-p-38, and p-JNK).\nOur data suggest that hypoxia is the key regulating factor that triggers inflammation as well as apoptosis in the human atherosclerotic plaque.",

Bivalirudin use is able to reduce postprocedural bleedings in percutaneous interventions when compared with UFH. The study purpose was to evaluate, in a randomized study, the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin versus heparin during CAS, using proximal endovascular occlusion (PEO) as a distal protection device.\nFrom January 2006 to December 2009, 220 patients undergoing CAS using PEO have been randomly assigned to one of the study arms (control arm: 100 UI/kg UFH or bivalirudin arm: 0.75 mg/kg intravenous bolus and intraprocedural infusion at 1.75 mg/kg/h).\nProcedural success was achieved in all the patients. No episodes of intraprocedural thrombosis occurred. One major stroke occurred in the bivalirudin arm, and two minor strokes occurred, one in each group. A significant difference in the incidence of postprocedural bleedings was observed between the study groups; bivalirudin use was associated with reduced number of bleedings according to Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction criteria.\nThe use of bivalirudin should be considered a safe and effective anticoagulation regimen during CAS, using PEO as a distal protection device. Bivalirudin use is associated with a reduced incidence of bleedings.",

A staged endograft repair of a complex, chronic Stanford type B aortic dissection with aneurysmal degeneration is reported in a 50-year-old man. The aneurysmal portion of the dissection extended from the distal arch to both common iliac arteries and was covered with an endograft from the ascending aorta to both external iliac arteries. Aortic arch branches, visceral, and renal arteries were bypassed using open technique. The patient had no neurologic complications. This case report illustrates the feasibility of the hybrid technique in selected high-risk patients when confronted with complex aortic pathology.",

    "abstract": "Estimation of the risk of adverse long-term outcome is of paramount importance in the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nWe evaluated the accuracy of two specific risk score systems, the Finnvasc score and the modified Prevent III (mPIII) score, in 1425 CLI patients who underwent unilateral, infrainguinal surgical (47.6%) or endovascular (52.4%) revascularization. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the predictive value of these risk scoring methods.\nThe area under the ROC curve of Finnvasc score for prediction of 30-day amputation was 0.609 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.549-0.677) and of mPIII score 0.533 (95% CI 0.457-0.609). The area under ROC curve of Finnvasc score for prediction of 30-day amputation-free survival was 0.622 (95% CI 0.573-0.671) and of mPIII score 0.588 (95% CI 0.533-0.642). The area under the ROC curve of Finnvasc score for prediction of 1-year amputation-free survival was 0.630 (95% CI 0.597-0.663, P<.0001) and of mPIII score 0.634 (95% CI 0.600-0.667, P<.0001). Finnvasc score predicted leg salvage (relative risk [RR] 1.431, 95% CI 1.319-1.551), survival (RR 1.233, 95% CI 1.116-1.363), and amputation-free survival (RR 1.422, 95% CI 1.319-1.534). mPIII score also predicted leg salvage (RR 1.190, 95% CI 1.108-1.277), survival (RR 1.245, 95% CI 1.193-1.300), and amputation-free survival (RR 1.223, 95% CI 1.176-1.272).\nFinnvasc and modified PIII risk scoring methods predict long-term outcome of patients undergoing infrainguinal revascularization for CLI. Finnvasc score seems to perform well also in predicting immediate postoperative outcome.",

    "abstract": "Successful thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) requires adequate proximal and distal fixation and seal. We report our experience of planned celiac artery coverage during endovascular repair of complex thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA).\nSince 2004, 228 patients underwent TEVAR under elective (n=162, 71%) and emergent circumstances (66, 29%). Patients with inadequate distal stent grafts landing zones during TEVAR underwent detailed evaluation of the gastroduodenal arcade with communicating collaterals between the celiac and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) by computed tomography angiography and intraoperative arteriogram. If needed, in presence of a patent SMA and demonstration of collaterals to the celiac artery, the stent grafts were extended to the SMA with celiac artery coverage. Furthermore, instances when further lengthening of distal thoracic stent graft landing zone was needed to obtain an adequate seal, the SMA was partially covered with the endograft, and a balloon expandable stent was routinely deployed in proximal SMA to maintain patency. Outcome data were prospectively collected and analyzed retrospectively.\nThirty-one of 228 (14%) patients with TEVAR required celiac artery interruption; 24 (77%) had demonstrable collaterals to the SMA. Twelve (39%) of 31 patients underwent additional partial SMA coverage by stent graft, and proximal SMA stent. The majority of patients were females (n=20, 65%), the mean age was 74 years (range 55-87 years), and the mean TAA size was 6.5 cm. Postoperative complications included visceral ischemia in 2 (6%) patients, paraplegia in 2 (6%) patients, and death in 2 (6%) patients. All type 1b endoleaks (n=2, 6%) and type 2 endoleaks vial retrograde flow from the celiac artery (n=3, 10%) were successfully treated by transfemoral coil embolization. Over a mean follow-up of 15 months, there have been no other complications of mesenteric ischemia, spinal cord ischemia, SMA in-stent stenosis, or conversion to open surgical repair.\nOur findings suggest that celiac artery coverage to facilitate adequate distal sealing during TEVAR with complex TAA is relatively safe in the presence of SMA-celiac collaterals. Pre-existing SMA stenosis can be successfully treated by balloon expandable stents during TEVAR, and endoleaks arising from distal stent grafts attachment site or via retrograde flow from the celiac artery can be successfully managed by transfemoral coil embolization. Although early results are encouraging, long-term efficacy of these procedures remains to be determined and vigilant follow-up is needed.",

    "abstract": "The first-line intervention for intermittent claudication is usually supervised exercise therapy (SET). The literature describes a range of exercise programs varying in setting, duration, and content. The purpose of the present study was to examine the exercise protocols offered and to identify the impact of the intensity of the SET programs (in terms of frequency, duration, and type of exercise) on improvements in walking distance (response) in the first 3 months. The present study is part of the Exercise Therapy in Peripheral Arterial Disease (EXITPAD) study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of SET provided by regional physiotherapists, with or without daily feedback, on the level of activities with the effects of walking advice.\nThe analysis included patients randomized to receive SET with or without feedback. The physical therapists administering the SET were asked to fill out therapy evaluation sheets stating frequency, duration, and type of exercises. The relationship between training volume and the impact on walking distance was explored by dividing training volume data into tertiles and relating them to the median change in maximum walking distance at 3 and 12 months.\nData of 169 patients were included in the analysis. A SET program consisting of at least two training sessions per week each lasting over 30 minutes, during the first 3 months of a 1-year program tailored to individual patients' needs led to better results in terms of walking distance after 3 and 12 months than the other variants. The results of our analysis dividing training volume into tertiles suggest that there is a relationship between training volume and improvement in walking distance and that at least 590 minutes of training should be offered in the first 3 months. No differences were found between program involving only walking and a combination of exercises, nor between individual and group training.\nA SET programs consisting of at least two training sessions a week, each lasting over 30 minutes, should be offered during the first 3 months of the SET program to optimize improvement in terms of maximum walking distance.",

    "abstract": "Mapping of venous reflux routes associated with medially or laterally located venous leg ulcers and their source of origin.\nThis prospective report presents the results of duplex investigations performed in consecutive leg ulcer patients, all with venous reflux, in a time period over 2 years. A total of 169 patients (183 legs), with chronic venous leg ulcers (CEAP: C6) were examined in a private practice. The data collection integrated an examination that included medical history and clinical diagnoses and incorporated measurements such as body mass index, oscillometric index, and range of motion of the ankle joint. Venous function was assessed with duplex ultrasound, and the cases were described using the advanced CEAP classification. Additionally, a \"sourcing\" technique was performed with duplex ultrasound investigation of the ulcer bed and the venous system under manual compression and release of the ulcer. The principle of \"sourcing\" is to follow venous reflux from the ulcer area to its proximal origin. The detected reflux routes were classified either as \"axial\" or \"crossover\" type.\nA total of 20% of the ulcer patients showed no clinically visible varicose veins. One hundred three patients had medial ulcers, 54 lateral ulcers, 21 medial and lateral, and five had gaiter ulcers. Sixty-four (35%) of the medially located ulcers had reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV), 28 (15%) showed reflux in the medial perforating veins (axial types), and 11 (6%) had reflux in the small saphenous vein (SSV; crossover type). From 54 patients presenting with lateral ulcers, 25 (14%) showed GSV incompetence (crossover type) and only 13 (7%) SSV incompetence (axial type). Sixteen patients showed refluxes penetrating from deep into lateral perforating veins.\nCrossover reflux routes were detected in 25 of 54 (46%) legs with lateral and in 11 of 103 (11%) legs with medial ulceration (\u03c72 44.34; P<.001). In venous ulcer patients, an extended examination (CEAP classification) and a special duplex technique (\"sourcing\") are recommended to identify the specific route responsible for the venous reflux.

    "abstract": "LOX-1, a lectin-like receptor on endothelial cells, facilitates the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Expression of LOX-1 is involved in the pathobiological effects of oxLDL in endothelial cells, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and leukocytic adhesion. Moderate consumption of phenolic-enriched food may have a protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis via the antioxidant capacity of phenolic compounds at the endothelial level. In this study, we determined whether ellagic acid, a polyphenolic compound widely distributed in fruits and nuts, protects against oxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction by modulating the LOX-1-mediated signaling pathway.\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with ellagic acid at doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 \u03bcM for 2 hours and then incubated with oxLDL (150 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 24 hours.\nLOX-1 protein expression was markedly lower after exposure to oxLDL in HUVECs pretreated with ellagic acid or diphenyleneiodonium, a well-known inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, than in HUVECs exposed to oxLDL alone, suggesting that ellagic acid deactivates NADPH oxidase. We also found that oxLDL activated the membrane assembly of p47phox, Rac1, gp91 and p22phox, and the subsequent induction of ROS generation; however, ROS generation was markedly suppressed in cells pretreated with ellagic acid or anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody. In addition, oxLDL down-regulated eNOS and up-regulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS), thereby augmenting the formation of NO and protein nitrosylation. Furthermore, oxLDL induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, activated the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules interleukin-(IL) 6 and IL-8 and the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin, and stimulated the adherence of THP-1 (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) to HUVECs. Pretreatment with ellagic acid, however, exerted significant cytoprotective effects in all events.\nFindings from this study may provide insight into a possible molecular mechanism by which ellagic acid inhibits LOX-1-induced endothelial dysfunction. Our data indicate that ellagic acid exerts its protective effects by inhibiting NADPH oxidase-induced overproduction of superoxide, suppressing the release of NO by down-regulating iNOS, enhancing cellular antioxidant defenses, and attenuating oxLDL-induced LOX-1 up-regulation and eNOS down-regulation.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been advocated as an alternative to redo surgery for patients with post-carotid endarterectomy (CEA) stenosis. This study compares early and late clinical outcomes for both groups.\nThis study analyzes 192 patients: 72 had reoperation (Group A) and 120 had CAS for post-CEA stenosis (Group B). Patients were followed prospectively and had duplex ultrasounds at 1 month, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. The perioperative complications (perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction/death, cranial nerve injury) and 4-year end points were analyzed. A Kaplan-Meier lifetable analysis was used to estimate rates of freedom from stroke, stroke-free survival, \u226550% restenosis, and \u226580% restenosis.\nDemographic/clinical characteristics were comparable for both groups, except for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, which were significantly higher in Group B. The indications for reoperations were transient ischemic attacks/stroke in 72% for Group A versus 57% for Group B (P=.0328). The mean follow-up was 33 months (range, 1-86 months) for Group A and 24 months (range, 1-78 months) for Group B (P=.0026). The proportion of early (<24 months) carotid restenosis prior to intervention was 51% in Group A versus 27% in Group B (P=.0013). The perioperative stroke rates were 3% and 1%, respectively (P=.5573). There were no myocardial infarctions or deaths in either group. The overall incidence of cranial nerve injury was 14% for Group A versus 0% for Group B (P<.0001). However, there was no statistical difference between the groups relating to permanent cranial nerve injury (1% versus 0%). The combined early and late stroke rates for Groups A and B were 3% and 2%, respectively (P=.6347). The stroke-free rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for Groups A and B were 97%, 97%, 97%, and 97% and 98%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively (P=.6490). The stroke-free survival rates were not significantly different. The rates of freedom from \u226550% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 98%, 95%, 95%, and 95% for Group A versus 95%, 89%, 80%, and 72% for Group B (P=.0175). The freedom from \u226580% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for Groups A and B were 98%, 97%, 97%, and 97% versus 99%, 96%, 92%, and 87%, respectively (P=.2281). Four patients (one symptomatic) in Group B had reintervention for \u226580% restenosis. The rate of freedom from reintervention for Groups A and B were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% versus 94%, 89%, 83%, and 79%, respectively (P=.0634).\nCAS is as safe as redo CEA. Redo CEA has a higher incidence of transient cranial nerve injury; however, CAS has a higher incidence of \u226550% in-stent restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is the leading cause of foot ulceration and lower extremity amputations (LEAs). The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate current evidence regarding the prognostic value of the Semmes Weinstein monofilament examination (SWME) in predicting foot ulceration and LEA in patients with DM.\nThe MEDLINE/PubMed database was searched through November 2009 for articles pertaining to diabetic foot and SWME with no language or publication date restrictions. Prognostic studies with original data assessing the predictive value of SWME for foot ulceration or LEA in patients with DM were included in the selection. Data were systematically extracted and analyzed by two independent investigators. Absolute risks and relative risks were determined for each study.\nOf the 863 studies identified, nine articles were relevant, involving 11,007 patients with DM. Six studies were identified that assessed the prognostic value of SWME regarding diabetic foot ulceration. The relative risk for patients with a positive SWME result versus those with a negative result ranged from 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 3.2) to 7.9 (95% CI, 4.4 to 14.3) in the identified studies with follow up between 1 and 4 years. Three of the studies assessed the risk of LEA with a positive SWME result. The relative risk for LEA ranged from 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.6) to 15.1 (95% CI, 4.3 to 52.6) with follow-up between 1.5 and 3.3 years.\nAll nine studies found SWME to be a significant and independent predictor of future foot ulceration or likely of future LEA as well in patients with DM. Therefore, SWME is an important evidence-based tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with diabetic foot, thus enabling improved patient selection for early intervention and management. More research should be conducted to elucidate the relationship between SWME and LEA.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma (SRH) associated with iliac vein rupture is a rare but life-threatening emergency with high operative mortality. This study summarizes our experience in providing diagnostic and therapeutic management for this rare clinical entity.\nBetween May 2002 and May 2009, nine patients were admitted to our hospital for SRH and acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Medical data for demographics, clinical presentation, auxiliary examinations, treatment modalities, outcomes, and follow-up were retrospectively analyzed.\nNine patients (8 women, 1 man) were enrolled in this study. All were aged>45 years (range, 46-70 years). The common clinical manifestations were sudden onset of left lower abdominal or lumbar pain, swelling of the left lower extremity, anemia, and hypotension. Most patients were diagnosed by duplex ultrasound imaging and computed tomography scan. Three patients were treated conservatively, and six underwent surgical or combined treatments, comprising 2 repairs of iliac vein, 1 iliac vein ligation and Palma-Dale bypass graft, 1 pelvic vein ligation, 1 removal of hematoma, and 1 repair of iliac vein, thrombectomy, and endovascular stent placement. The iliac vein ruptured in five patients. May-Thurner syndrome was found in three patients. One patient died after surgery (operative mortality, 16.7%). Postoperative morbidity was 50%. Mean volume of perioperative blood transfusion was 900\u00b1640 mL (range, 0-2000 mL). Mean lengths of stay were 2.7\u00b11.4 days (range, 2-5 days) in the intensive care unit and 16.9\u00b12.4 days (range, 14-21 days) in the hospital. Eight patients were postoperatively treated with 6 months of warfarin. Mean follow-up was 30.5\u00b115.0 months (range, 6-50 months). The occurrence rate of chronic venous insufficiency was 87.5% during follow-up.\nSRH with concomitant DVT, especially in women aged >45, should be considered in patients with sudden lower abdominal or lumbar pain, leg swelling, anemia, and shock. Spontaneous iliac vein rupture and the presence of May-Thurner syndrome should be considered in these patients. Surgical interventions were associated with high mortality and morbidity. In our experience, conservative therapy was safer than open surgical procedures.",

    "results": "Nine patients (8 women, 1 man) were enrolled in this study. All were aged>45 years (range, 46-70 years). The common clinical manifestations were sudden onset of left lower abdominal or lumbar pain, swelling of the left lower extremity, anemia, and hypotension. Most patients were diagnosed by duplex ultrasound imaging and computed tomography scan. Three patients were treated conservatively, and six underwent surgical or combined treatments, comprising 2 repairs of iliac vein, 1 iliac vein ligation and Palma-Dale bypass graft, 1 pelvic vein ligation, 1 removal of hematoma, and 1 repair of iliac vein, thrombectomy, and endovascular stent placement. The iliac vein ruptured in five patients. May-Thurner syndrome was found in three patients. One patient died after surgery (operative mortality, 16.7%). Postoperative morbidity was 50%. Mean volume of perioperative blood transfusion was 900\u00b1640 mL (range, 0-2000 mL). Mean lengths of stay were 2.7\u00b11.4 days (range, 2-5 days) in the intensive care unit and 16.9\u00b12.4 days (range, 14-21 days) in the hospital. Eight patients were postoperatively treated with 6 months of warfarin. Mean follow-up was 30.5\u00b115.0 months (range, 6-50 months). The occurrence rate of chronic venous insufficiency was 87.5% during follow-up.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the mouse peritoneum can function like a bioreactor to generate directed bio-engineered tissues such as those used for bypass grafting. Additionally, we reasoned that the mouse animal model would allow us to elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the generation of tissue in peritoneal cavity.\nPlastic tubes (two tubes/mouse) were implanted into the peritoneal cavity of three strains of mice (C57BL/6, BALB/c, and MRL). The tubes were harvested, tissue capsule surrounding the tubes was removed, and analyzed by immunostaining (five capsules/five mice/strain) and microarray (three capsules/three mice/strain). In addition, the tissue capsules that were harvested from MRL mice (n = 21) were grafted into abdominal aorta of the same mice as autografts. The patency of all grafts was monitored by micro-ultrasound, and their functionality was assessed by laser Doppler imaging of blood flow in femoral arteries. Venous (n = 13) and arterial isografts (n = 11) were used as positive controls. In a negative control group (five mice/strain), the abdominal aorta was occluded by double ligation with 9-0 silk.\nThe implanted plastic tubes required at least 8 weeks of incubation in the peritoneum of the three strains of mice in order to generate useful grafts. No vascular cells were found in the tissue capsules. Microarray analysis of tissue capsules revealed that the capsular cells express a gene expression program that is vastly shared among the three strains of mice, and the cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity. The micro-ultrasound analysis of the grafts showed that 62% of autografts remained patent compared with 77% of venous isografts and 91% of arterial isografts. The laser Doppler imaging analysis showed that blood flow dropped by 40% and 35% in the autografts and vein isografts, respectively, 1 day after surgery. The flow, however, rebounded to the level of arterial isografts 1 month post-surgery and remained unchanged among all grafts for the next 4 months. Immunostaining of the autografts showed a thick vessel wall with endothelial cells that lined the lumen and smooth muscle cells that constituted the graft wall.\nThe mouse peritoneal cavity of mice has the ability to function like a bioreactor to generate bio-engineered tissues. The tissue capsules harvested from peritoneal cavity of a mouse are composed of nonvascular cells that display phenotype of progenitor cells. After grafting, however, the capsule autografts become arterialized and remained patent for at least 4 months after surgery, similar to venous or arterial isografts.",

Furthermore, the daily ambulatory cadences of women are correlated with their calf muscle StO2 during exercise, as women who walk slower in the community setting reach their minimum calf muscle StO2 sooner than those who walk at faster paces.

    "abstract": "To assess the potential benefit of the addition of a covered stent to a subintimal recanalized artery in patients with femoro-popliteal occlusions.\nFrom September 2003 to October 2005, we retrospectively analyzed all patients admitted for severe claudication or critical limb ischemia related to long femoro-popliteal occlusions and treated with subintimal recanalization. Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they received a stent or not. All patients in the group treated with stent received a stent graft, and the entire length of the recanalized artery was covered in each case. Demographic data, indications, procedure, and outcomes were examined using survival analysis statistical techniques.\nFifty-three patients (54 limbs) were treated consecutively for severe claudication (n=19) or critical limb ischemia (n=34). Thirty-four (64%) had a stent placed, while 19 (35.8%) did not. The mean length of the lesions treated was 20.11 cm (range, 5-35 cm). Statistically, there was no significant difference in lesion length, Rutherford stage of peripheral-artery disease, Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification, and distal run-off between the two groups. The technical success rate was 94.5%, and two out of the three failures were treated with surgical bypass in one case and major amputation in the other. The third patient received only medical treatment. Combined procedures were required in the treatment of 68.2% of limbs in the no-stent group and 55.8% in the stent group. Mean follow up was 16.9 months (range, 1-35 months). At 1 year, primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency for the stent vs no-stent groups was, respectively, 61.8% vs 78.9% (P=.49), 70.6% vs 78.9% (P=.78), and 88.2% vs 78.9% (P=.22). The 1-year limb salvage rate for the stent vs no-stent group was 94.1% vs 100% (P=.7).\nCombining subintimal angioplasty with a stent graft in femoro-popliteal lesions does not improve patency. The limb salvage rate remains high after addition of a stent graft. Rigorous monitoring is recommended to diagnose and treat restenosis early in order to improve patency.",

Independent patient- and provider-related characteristics were analyzed. Clinical outcomes included complications and mortality; economic outcomes included length of stay (LOS) and cost (2007 dollars). Outcomes were compared using \u03c72, ANOVA, and multivariate regression analysis.\nFour thousand, one hundred nineteen patients with AIOD were identified. Endovascular procedures increased by 18%. Patients who underwent endovascular procedures were more likely to be \u226565 years of age (46% vs 37%), female (54% vs 49%), and in the highest quartile of household income (20% vs 16%), all P<.05. Endovascular patients were more likely to be non-elective (41% vs 20%), in the highest comorbidity index group (8% vs 5%), and with iliac artery disease (67% vs 33%), all P\u2264.05. In bivariate analysis, endovascular procedures were associated with lower complication rates (16% vs 25%), shorter LOS (2.2 vs 5.8 days), and lower hospital costs ($13,661 vs $17,161), all P<.001. In multivariate analysis, endovascular procedures had significantly lower complication rates and cost, and shorter LOS.\nEndovascular procedures have superior short-term clinical and economic outcomes compared with open procedures for the treatment of AIOD in the inpatient setting.

    "abstract": "While the significance of type II endoleaks (T2ELs) on the long-term outcome of endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is debatable, duplex ultrasonography (DU) parameters have been suggested to be predictive of their closure or persistence. The purpose of this study was to determine which, if any, of these variables was associated with persistent T2EL or increased AAA sac diameter.\nBetween 1998 and 2009, 278 patients underwent EVAR and post-operative DU surveillance during long-term follow-up (1-11 years) in our accredited non-invasive vascular laboratory by one of three experienced technologists. DU measured intra-sac flow velocity (IFV), spectral doppler waveform (SDW) patterns, post-EVAR sac diameter, and number of T2ELs.\nT2ELs developed in 14% (38/278) of patients post-EVAR. Fourteen patients had T2ELs that resolved, and sac diameter decreased or remained the same: the average IFV was 42 cm/second; SDW patterns were monophasic in five, biphasic in seven and bidirectional in two; and multiple T2ELs were not present (0%) in any patient. Twelve patients had T2ELs that persisted, but sac diameter decreased or remained the same: the average IFV was 47 cm/second; SDW patterns were monophasic in one, biphasic in five, bidirectional in five, and undetermined in one; and multiple T2ELs were found in 17% (2) of patients. Twelve patients had T2ELs that persisted and were associated with increased sac diameter: the average IFV was 43 cm/second, SDW patterns were monophasic in one, biphasic in two, and bidirectional in nine; and multiple T2ELs were identified in 75% (9) of patients. None of the 38 patients with T2ELs treated with selective surgical or endovascular intervention for enlarging sac diameters (11/12) experienced a ruptured aneurysm.\nContrary to previous smaller reports of T2ELs and DU surveillance, parameters such as IFV did not correlate with increased post-EVAR sac diameter. The presence of multiple T2ELs and bidirectional SDW may be the strongest factors predictive of increased sac diameter.",

We present the case of a young man who was assigned to our hospital with arterial hypertension and stenosis of the left renal artery. Extrinsic compression was diagnosed by duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography. We performed laparoscopic decompression using the transperitoneal retrorenal approach. Antihypertensive medication could be stopped thereafter and duplex ultrasound revealed a normal blood flow to the left renal artery. We therefore propose laparoscopic treatment of left renal artery entrapment as a minimally-invasive alternative to open surgery.",

    "abstract": "Despite the efficacy of collagen in femoral artery pseudoaneurysm treatment, as reported in one patient study, its use has not yet gained wide acceptance in clinical practice. In this particular study, the collagen was not described in detail. To further investigate the potential of collagen preparations, we prepared and characterized highly purified injectable fibrillar type I collagen and evaluated its use for femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (PSA) treatment in vivo using a pig model.\nPurified fibrillar type I collagen was characterized using electron microscopy. The effect of three different sterilization procedures, ie, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (H2O2), ethylene oxide gas (EtO), and gamma irradiation, was studied on both SDS-PAGE and platelet aggregation. Different collagen injectables were prepared (3%, 4%, and 5%) and tested using an injection force test applying a 21-gauge needle. To evaluate the network characteristics of the injectable collagen, the collagen was suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37\u00b0C and studied both macroscopically and electron microscopically. To determine whether the collagen induced hemostasis in vivo, a pig PSA model was used applying a 4% EtO sterilized collagen injectable, and evaluation by angiography and routine histology.\nElectron microscopy of the purified type I collagen revealed intact fibrils with a distinct striated pattern and a length<300 \u03bcm. Both SDS-PAGE and platelet aggregation analysis of the sterilized collagen indicated no major differences between EtO and H2O2 sterilization, although gamma-irradiated collagen showed degradation products. Both 3% and 4% (w/v) collagen suspensions were acceptable with respect to the force used (<50 N). The 4% suspension was selected as the preferred injectable collagen, which formed a dense network under physiologic conditions. Testing the collagen in vivo (n=5), the angiograms revealed that the PSA partly or completely coagulated. Histology confirmed the network formation, which was surrounded by thrombus.\nCollagen injectables were prepared and EtO sterilized without major loss of structural integrity and platelet activity. In vivo, the injectable collagen formed a dense network and triggered (partial) local hemostasis. Although optimization is needed, an injectable collagen may be used as a therapeutic agent for femoral PSA treatment.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-SD) has recently been reported to occur in the cardiovascular system and manifest as inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Thoracic aortic lesions are often associated with aortitis in several divergent etiologies. Thus, this study was performed to review thoracic aortic lesions from the aspect of IgG4-SD and to elucidate the clinicopathologic characteristics of this subgroup in the thoracic aorta.\nThe study comprised 125 patients, including 71 with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), 44 with aortic dissection, 7 with Takayasu aortitis, and 3 with infectious aortitis. IgG4-SD was identified by diffuse infiltration of numerous IgG4-positive plasmacytes by immunohistochemical examinations. Clinicopathologic features were compared between IgG4-related and IgG4-unrelated lesions.\nAmong the 125 patients, IgG4-SD was found in 5 patients with TAA but was not detected in the other subgroups of thoracic aortic lesion. IgG4-related TAA included one case of lymphoplasmacytic aortitis, 1 case of inflammatory aneurysm, and three cases of atherosclerotic aneurysms. Patients with IgG4-related TAA showed clinicopathologic features similar to patients with IgG4-SD: male gender, old age, history of bronchial asthma and allergies, elevation of white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein levels, and IgG4 and IgE concentrations (in one patient); eosinophilic infiltration, obliterative phlebitis, lymph follicle formation, and perineural inflammation. In addition, compared with IgG4-unrelated TAA, IgG4-related TAA was characterized by clinically more frequency of involvement of the aortic arch (P = .002), saccular formation (P = .003), and fibrous adhesion to surrounding tissue (P < .001), and histopathologically thicker entire aortic wall and adventitia (P < .001 each).\nIgG4-SD is involved in 4% of all thoracic aortic lesions and uniformly presents in the form of an aneurysm with distinct histologic and clinicopathologic features. IgG4-SD represents one, albeit rare, etiology of TAA, especially those originating in the aortic arch.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with reduced progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. Mechanisms responsible for this negative association remain unknown. We created AAAs in hyperglycemic mice to examine the influence of serum glucose concentration on experimental aneurysm progression.\nAortic aneurysms were induced in hyperglycemic (DM) and normoglycemic models by using intra-aortic porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) infusion in C57BL/6 mice or by systemic infusion of angiotensin II (ANG) in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice, respectively. In an additional DM cohort, insulin therapy was initiated after aneurysm induction. Aneurysmal aortic enlargement progression was monitored with serial transabdominal ultrasound measurements. At sacrifice, AAA cellularity and proteolytic activity were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and substrate zymography, respectively. Influences of serum glucose levels on macrophage migration were examined in separate models of thioglycollate-induced murine peritonitis.\nAt 14 days after PPE infusion, AAA enlargement in hyperglycemic mice (serum glucose \u2265 300 mg/dL) was less than that in euglycemic mice (PPE-DM: 54% \u00b1 19% vs PPE: 84% \u00b1 24%, P < .0001). PPE-DM mice also demonstrated reduced aortic mural macrophage infiltration (145 \u00b1 87 vs 253 \u00b1 119 cells/cross-sectional area, P = .0325), elastolysis (% residual elastin: 20% \u00b1 7% vs 12% \u00b1 6%, P = .0209), and neovascularization (12 \u00b1 8 vs 20 \u00b1 6 vessels/high powered field, P = .0229) compared with PPE mice. Hyperglycemia limited AAA enlargement after ANG infusion in ApoE(-/-) mice (ANG-DM: 38% \u00b1 12% vs ANG: 61% \u00b1 37% at day 28). Peritoneal macrophage production was reduced in response to thioglycollate stimulation in hyperglycemic mice, with limited augmentation noted in response to vascular endothelial growth factor administration. Insulin therapy reduced serum glucose levels and was associated with AAA enlargement rates intermediate between euglycemic and hyperglycemic mice (PPE: 1.21 \u00b1 0.14 mm vs PPE-DM: 1.00 \u00b1 0.04 mm vs PPE-DM + insulin: 1.14 \u00b1 0.05 mm).\nHyperglycemia reduces progression of experimental AAA disease; lowering of serum glucose levels with insulin treatment diminishes this protective effect. Identifying mechanisms of hyperglycemic aneurysm inhibition may accelerate development of novel clinical therapies for AAA disease.",

    "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is superior to ASA alone in patients with acute coronary syndromes and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We sought to determine whether clopidogrel plus ASA conferred benefit on limb outcomes over ASA alone in patients undergoing below-knee bypass grafting.\nPatients undergoing unilateral, below-knee bypass graft for atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were enrolled 2 to 4 days after surgery and were randomly assigned to clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus ASA 75 to 100 mg/day or placebo plus ASA 75 to 100 mg/day for 6 to 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of index-graft occlusion or revascularization, above-ankle amputation of the affected limb, or death. The primary safety endpoint was severe bleeding (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue plasminogen activator for Occluded coronary arteries [GUSTO] classification).\nIn the overall population, the primary endpoint occurred in 149 of 425 patients in the clopidogrel group vs 151 of 426 patients in the placebo (plus ASA) group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.23). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, the primary endpoint was significantly reduced by clopidogrel in prosthetic graft patients (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.95; P = .025) but not in venous graft patients (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.94-1.67, not significant [NS]). A significant statistical interaction between treatment effect and graft type was observed (P(interaction) = .008). Although total bleeds were more frequent with clopidogrel, there was no significant difference between the rates of severe bleeding in the clopidogrel and placebo (plus ASA) groups (2.1% vs 1.2%).\nThe combination of clopidogrel plus ASA did not improve limb or systemic outcomes in the overall population of PAD patients requiring below-knee bypass grafting. Subgroup analysis suggests that clopidogrel plus ASA confers benefit in patients receiving prosthetic grafts without significantly increasing major bleeding risk.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) leads to systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure in clinical and laboratory settings. We investigated the lung structural, functional, and genomic response to mesenteric IRI with and without regional intraischemic hypothermia (RIH) in rodents and hypothesized that RIH would protect the lung and preferentially modulate the distant organ transcriptome under these conditions.\nSprague-Dawley rats underwent sham laparotomy or superior mesenteric artery occlusion (SMAO) for 60 minutes with or without RIH. Gut temperature was maintained at 15\u00b0-20\u00b0C during SMAO, and systemic normothermia (37\u00b0C) was maintained throughout the study period. At 6 or 24 hours, lung tissue was collected for (1) histology, (2) myeloperoxidase activity, (3) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentrations, (4) lung wet/dry ratios, and (5) total RNA isolation and hybridization to Illumina's Sentrix BeadChips (>22,000 probes) for gene expression profiling. Significantly affected genes (false discovery rate <5% and fold change \u22651.5) were linked to gene ontology (GO) terms using MAPPFinder, and hypothermia-suppressed genes were further analyzed with Pubmatrix.\nMesenteric IRI-induced lung injury, as evidenced by leukocyte trafficking, alveolar hemorrhage, and increased BAL protein and wet/dry ratios, and activated a proinflammatory lung transcriptome compared with sham. In contrast, rats treated with RIH exhibited lung histology, BAL protein, and wet/dry ratios similar to sham. At 6 hours, GO analysis identified 232 hypothermia-suppressed genes related to inflammation, innate immune response, and cell adhesion, and 33 hypothermia-activated genes related to lipid and amine metabolism and defense response. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validated select array changes in top hypothermia-suppressed genes lipocalin-2 (lcn-2) and chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1), prominent genes associated with neutrophil activation and trafficking.\nTherapeutic hypothermia during SMAO provides distant organ protection and preferentially modulates the IRI-activated transcriptome in the rat lung. This study identifies potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets of mesenteric IRI and provides a platform for further mechanistic study of hypothermic protection at the cellular and subcellular level.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery has matured to the point that there exists robust bodies of literature exploring many of our therapies. However, this evidence is but one of the factors that dictate medical practice. Others include local patient demographics, the practical implications of healthcare delivery, and an individual surgeon's interpretation of this evidence, which can be somewhat subjective. As a result, there are numerous examples of vascular specialists' practice patterns differing depending on their geographic location. Recognizing this, the Editors of the Journal of Vascular Surgery and the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery have developed a series of Trans-Atlantic Debates to explore these instances. The inaugural debate explores the controversial question of how best to manage asymptomatic carotid artery stenoses. Our debators, Peter Schneider and Ross Naylor, offer reasoned and passionate arguments to defend their differing approaches. We trust that this addition to our journals will prove enlightening and, perhaps, entertaining.",

This article presents a complex case of a 28-year-old man who was first treated by vein graft reconstruction. At 12 months of follow-up, a nonanastomotic false aneurysm of the vein graft occurred and was treated by interposition of prosthetic graft. Two months later, an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm between the two grafts was excluded by two stent grafts. Based on our experience and a review of the literature, we compared the outcomes of prosthetic and autologous vein reconstructions and discussed the role of carotid ligation and immunosuppressive treatment.",

So far, Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is very rarely reported to be the causative organism of mycotic aortic aneurysms. We report 2 cases of mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms due to L. monocytogenes infection being treated by radical debridement, open in situ reconstruction with aorto-bi-iliac Dacron grafts, and long-term antibiotic therapy. Both patients recovered well from surgery. Interestingly, the long-time follow-up for the first patient 9 years after surgery was entirely uneventful. Open debridement in an in situ reconstruction with Dacron grafts followed by antibiotic therapy seems to be a suitable therapeutic regime for mycotic aneurysms due to L. monocytogenes.",

    "abstract": "Although secondary lymphedema is a common complication after surgical and radiation therapy for cancer, the treatment options for lymphedema remain limited and largely ineffective. We thus studied the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on promoting lymphangiogenesis and improving secondary lymphedema.\nA rabbit ear model of lymphedema was created by disruption of lymphatic vessels. Two weeks after surgery, the lymphedematous ear was treated with or without low-energy shock waves (0.09 mJ/mm(2), 200 shots), three times per week for 4 weeks.\nWestern blot analysis showed that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C (1.23-fold, P < .05) and VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3; 1.53-fold, P < .05) was significantly increased in the ears treated with shock wave than in the untreated lymphedematous ears. Compared with the control group, shock wave treatment led to a significant decrease in the thickness of lymphedematous ears (3.80 +/- 0.25 mm vs 4.54 +/- 0.18 mm, P < .05). Immunohistochemistry for VEGFR3 showed the density of lymphatic vessels was significantly increased by shock wave treatment (P < .05).\nExtracorporeal shock wave therapy promotes lymphangiogenesis and ameliorates secondary lymphedema, suggesting that extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be a novel, feasible, effective, and noninvasive treatment for lymphedema.",

    "abstract": "Most outcomes registries use a large number of variables to control for differences in patients. We sought to determine whether fewer variables could be used for risk adjustment without compromising hospital quality comparisons.\nWe used prospective, clinical data from the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) for five commonly performed inpatient vascular procedures (N = 24,744). For each of the five operations, we compared the ability of two parsimonious models (an intermediate model, using the top five variables for each procedure and a limited model using the top 2 variables from each procedure) and the full model (up to 42 variables) to predict the risk of mortality and morbidity at the patient and hospital level.\nThe parsimonious model was similar to the full model in all comparisons. For the five procedures, the intermediate, limited, and full models all had very similar discrimination at the patient-level (C indices of 0.87 vs 0.85 vs 0.87 for mortality and 0.77 vs 0.75 vs 0.77 for morbidity), and similar calibration, as assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. In evaluating hospital-level morbidity and mortality rates, the correlations between the parsimonious and full models were very high for both mortality (>0.97 across operations) and morbidity (>0.97 across operations).\nHospital quality comparisons for vascular surgery can be adequately risk-adjusted using a small number of important variables. Reducing the number of variables collected will significantly decrease the burden of data collection for hospitals choosing to participate in the vascular module of the ACS-NSQIP.",

    "abstract": "Claudication is the most common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease, producing significant ambulatory compromise. Our study evaluated patients with bilateral lower limb claudication and characterized their gait abnormality based on advanced biomechanical analysis using joint torques and powers.\nTwenty patients with bilateral claudication (10 with isolated aortoiliac disease and 10 with combined aortoiliac and femoropopliteal disease) and 16 matched controls ambulated on a walkway while 3-dimensional biomechanical data were collected. Patients walked before and after onset of claudication pain. Joint torques and powers at early, mid, and late stance for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were calculated for claudicating patients before and after the onset of claudication pain and were compared to controls.\nClaudicating patients exhibited significantly reduced hip and knee power at early stance (weight-acceptance phase) due to decreased torques produced by the hip and knee extensors. In mid stance (single-limb support phase), patients had significantly reduced knee and hip power due to the decreased torques produced by the knee extensors and the hip flexors. In late stance (propulsion phase), reduced propulsion was noted with significant reduction in ankle plantar flexor torques and power. These differences were present before and after the onset of pain, with certain parameters worsening in association with pain.\nThe gait of claudication is characterized by failure of specific and identifiable muscle groups needed to perform normal walking (weight acceptance, single-limb support, and propulsion). Parameters of gait are abnormal with the first steps taken, in the absence of pain, and certain of these parameters worsen after the onset of claudication pain.",

The rate of neck dilation was greatest at early follow-up intervals. At 48 months, median neck dilation was 5.3 mm (range, 2.3-9.8 mm). The extent of neck dilation at 48 months correlated with percentage of stent graft oversizing (Spearman rho = 0.61, P < .001). No type I endoleak or migration >5 mm occurred.\nAfter EVAR with the Zenith stent graft, the neck dilates until its diameter approximates the diameter of the stent graft.

The study goal was to calculate the radiation dose in our unit and compare it against other published data and national guidelines.\nAll EVAR procedures were identified from a prospectively maintained database.

Radiation exposure from subsequent computed tomography (CT) imaging was included in the overall exposure. Results are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation.\nFrom October 1998 to October 2008, 320 elective patients underwent EVAR. Mean screening time was 29.4 +/- 23.3 minutes, and the radiation dose was 11.7 +/- 7.1 mSv. The EVAR was an emergency in 64 patients. The mean screening time was 22.9 +/- 18.2 minutes, and the radiation dose was 13.4 +/- 8.6 mSv. During the first postoperative year, follow-up CT scans exposed the patients to 24.0 mSv, with 8.0 mSv in subsequent years. Abdominal radiographs added an additional 1.8 mSv each year.\nEVAR and the follow-up investigations involve substantial amounts of radiation, with well-recognized carcinogenic risks. Because patient safety is paramount, radiation exposure should be minimized. This may be possible by standardizing radiation exposure throughout the United Kingdom by implementing national guidelines and considering other imaging modalities for follow-up.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to endovascular repair (EVAR), the absence of rigorous imaging follow-up after open surgical repair (OSR) has rendered the perception that late failure (LF) is rare. Better understanding of associated factors with LF will help define OSR follow-up paradigms and perhaps alter initial repair strategy to facilitate treatment of LF. The aim of this study is to evaluate aspects of LF requiring intervention after OSR.\nFrom 1998 to 2008, data were collected prospectively on 1097 patients who underwent an aortic endovascular repair. Patients undergoing intervention for LF contiguous with prior OSR were subjected to further analysis. The indication for reintervention was a maximal diameter >60 mm. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to compare patients and disease variables (18 variables regarding age, comorbidities, family history, etiology, and extent) with time to LF.\nLF of open surgical aneurysm repair was identified in 104 (9.5%) patients. Mean aneurysm diameter was 72 +/- 12 mm. Mean age at first repair and time between the two repairs were 61.4 +/- 10.0 and 10.8 +/- 6.0 years, respectively. When compared with the 993 other patients whose EVAR was their primary repair, LF patients were significantly younger at the time of their first repair (61.4 +/- 10.0 vs 74.1 +/- 9.6 years; P < .00001) and more frequently had a family history of aneurysms (20% vs 7%; P = .001). They were also more likely to have presented with dissection, renal insufficiency, and manifestations of atherosclerosis. On multivariable analysis, patients with an initial incomplete OSR (aneurysm located in another aortic segment but not treated at the time of the primary repair), more extensive aneurysms (those involving the descending thoracic or the thoracoabdominal aorta), and older patients experienced earlier LF (P < .00001, .002, and .001, respectively). Although we were incapable of determining the incidence of LF after OSR, 34% of patients presenting with LF were regional to our center.\nAneurysmal disease is an ongoing process potentially involving the entire aorta. Segments that appear normal prior to OSR of EVAR may be vulnerable to LF. We identified several groups of patients following OSR who mandate more aggressive follow-up given their propensity to present with LF. The threshold and strategies guiding reintervention in the setting of LF is dependent upon many factors relating to the structure and the morphology of the aorta and implanted graft, the type of anastomosis, and patient comorbidities. Therefore, surgeons should consider LF treatment options when planning an aneurysm repair in an effort to optimize any later interventions, and have specifically tailored follow-up paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous closure is a common method to treat saphenous vein incompetence. Despite attempts to prevent it, some patients have extension of thrombus above the ideal site of closure immediately below the epigastric vein. We have developed a classification system for the level of saphenous vein closure to guide further therapy after endovenous treatment.\nA six-tier classification system was developed, based on thrombus proximity to the epigastric or femoral vein, and an algorithm for treatment, based on level of closure was applied to all patients.\nFive hundred consecutive patients underwent radio-frequency ablation of the saphenous vein; it was successfully closed in 498 (99.6%) patients. Thirteen patients (2.6%) experienced thrombus bulging into the femoral vein or adherent to its wall, which was treated with anticoagulation. All of these patients had thrombus retraction to the level of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) in an average of 16 days with concurrent anticoagulation. No femoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurred in the series. There was a significantly higher rate of proximal thrombus extension in those patients with a history of DVT and those with a great saphenous vein (GSV) diameter of >8 mm (P < .02).\nA classification system for saphenous endovenous closure which extends above the epigastric vein has been helpful in guiding management. A GSV diameter at the SFJ of >8 mm and a history of DVT results in significantly higher rates of proximal thrombus extension into the femoral vein. A short course of LMWH, until clot retracts back into the saphenous vein, is therapeutic. Management of the patients with thrombus flush with the femoral vein wall still needs to be defined, but the outcome from these patients is generally benign.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that the threshold for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) suitable for endovascular repair (EVAR) be lowered. A critical step in this pathway is determining whether smaller AAAs are more likely to be anatomically suitable for EVAR; that is, whether suitability is lost as the AAA grows.\nPatients who underwent ultrasound (US) imaging for asymptomatic AAAs at the University of Rochester Medical Center between January 1, 2003, and January 31, 2007, were identified. All those who had an abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan \u2264 3 months of the US imaging were identified. CT scans were reviewed using predefined criteria to assess anatomic suitability for conventional EVAR (ie, without consideration of debranching).\nOf 3005 aortic US studies performed during this period, 221 had CT scans showing infrarenal aneurysms. Of these, 168 patients (76%) were candidates for EVAR and 52 (24%) were not, most commonly due to a short neck (40; 77% of excluded). Size measured by CT scanning (mean, 53 \u00b1 11 mm) averaged 4 mm larger than by US imaging (mean, 49 \u00b1 10 mm; r(2) = 0.66; P < .0001). Aneurysm size measured by CT scanning (P < .0001) or US imaging (P < .0001) correlated with anatomic suitability for EVAR. Mean sizes for those suitable were 52 \u00b1 9 mm by CT and 48 \u00b1 7 mm by US imaging, whereas mean sizes for those not suitable were 58 \u00b1 10 mm by CT and 53 \u00b1 8 mm by US imaging. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that an US cutoff of 4.87 mm best predicted anatomic suitability (86.2% if smaller, 64.8% if larger), whereas a CT cutoff of 57.0 mm best predicted suitability (84.7% if smaller, 63.2% if larger).\nAneurysm size measured by CT averaged 4 mm larger than by US imaging. Larger aneurysms are less likely to be anatomically suitable for EVAR, but the rate of suitability does not appreciably decrease until the aneurysm measures 49 mm by US imaging or 57 mm by CT scanning. This implies that waiting until the aneurysm reaches currently accepted size criteria for repair does not result in \"missing the window\" for EVAR; in other words, just as many patients are anatomically suitable for EVAR at currently accepted size cutoffs than if earlier intervention had been done.",

Visible distal embolization with flow occlusion caused neurologic complications in 10 patients (2.5%), and a structured and stepwise neurosalvage approach was attempted.\nGuidewire fragmentation and microcatheter injection of heparin and nitroglycerin were performed in all 10 patients as step 1. Intra-arterial thrombolysis was given in four patients and balloon angioplasty in five, as step 2. Intracranial stenting was done in one patient as the last step. Successful angiographic recanalization (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 2-3) occurred in 9 of 10 (90%). Residual neurologic sequel was observed in five, including three patients with hemorrhage complications (1 received emergent craniotomy).

    "abstract": "The presence of an endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) may predispose to sac expansion and potential sac rupture. The incidence of endoleak after AAA repair can be as high as 20% to 30%. We investigated whether warfarin anticoagulation was an independent risk factor for endoleak after EVAR for AAA.\nAll AAA patients who underwent elective EVAR were prospectively followed-up. Data for demographics, clinical comorbidities, outcomes, EVAR devices, and anticoagulation methods were recorded. All patients underwent routine follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) with 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric analysis was also completed.\nDuring a 7-year period, 127 consecutive patients with infrarenal AAAs who underwent EVAR were monitored for a mean of 2.14 years. The average age at the time of EVAR was 73.8 years. Warfarin therapy alone was administered to 24 patients, and anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy alone was administered to 103. During the study period, 38 (29.9%) endoleaks were documented. The overall endoleak rate was 13 of 24 in the warfarin group and 25 of 103 in the antiplatelet group (P = .004). CTA 3D volumetric aneurysm sac analysis showed an increase of 16.09% in the warfarin study group and a reduction of 9.71% in the antiplatelet group (P = .04).\nAnticoagulation with warfarin appears to be linked to an increased risk for the development of endoleak after EVAR, specifically type II. Volumetric analysis showed warfarin therapy also contributed to persistent aneurysm sac expansion. These data suggest that patients who require warfarin anticoagulation for other indications should be advised that they might be at an increased risk for the development of endoleaks, subsequent secondary interventions, persistent sac expansion, and possible delayed sac rupture.",

This study assessed the influence of DM on long-term outcomes of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, with or without stenting (PTA/stent), in patients with PVD.\nFrom January 2002 to December 2007, 920 patients underwent 1075 PTA/stent procedures. Patients were stratified into DM and non-DM cohorts. Study end points included primary patency (PP), assisted patency (AP), limb salvage, and survival and were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.\nThere were 533 DM and 542 non-DM limbs. Median follow-up was 34 months. Overall, the 5-year actuarial PP was 42% +/- 2.4%, AP was 81% +/- 2.0%, limb salvage was 89% +/- 1.6%, and survival was 60% +/- 2.4%. On univariate analysis, DM vs non-DM was associated with inferior 5-year PP (37% +/- 3.4% vs 46% +/- 3.3%; P = .009), limb salvage (84% +/- 2.6% vs 93% +/- 1.8%, P < .0001), and survival (52% +/- 3.5% vs 68% +/- 3.1%, P = .0001).

Although acceptable assisted patency rates can be achieved with close surveillance and reintervention, long-term limb salvage remains inferior in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic patients due to a more severe clinical presentation and poor runoff.",

    "abstract": "The long-term prognosis of arteriovenous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hemodialysis grafts remains poor, causing significant morbidity and costs. The high failure rate is due to a stenosis development of the graft-vein anastomosis, consisting of two pathophysiologically separate and characteristic lesions emerging from two main mechanisms: development of intimal hyperplasia in the vein and pseudointima in the graft. We developed a new venous anastomotic graft design that combines a flow diffuser and flow division, thereby creating a double-channel graft (Bi-Flow graft) and tested it in vitro.\nIn vitro experiments have been performed using silastic models of six different anastomotic configurations (straight end-to-side, cuffed Venaflo-type, large and small diffuser, and large and small Bi-Flow) inserted into a pulsatile-flow circuit. The silastic models were created using a computerized numerical control design approach, varying only the venous anastomoses. Velocity fields and shear stresses were obtained using particle image velocimetry, and volumetric flow rates through the models were measured using an ultrasound flowmeter.\nThe hooded graft configurations showed significantly lower shear forces than did the end-to-side anastomosis. The shear stresses in the straight end-to-side graft were as high as arterial wall stresses. Large separation areas were present in the hooded grafts, except for the small Bi-Flow graft, which showed only isolated separation zones near the baffle used to divide the flow.

    "abstract": "Although endovascular therapy for peripheral arterial disease has undergone tremendous changes, chronic total occlusion (CTO) remains a significant challenge for interventionalists. Failed CTO recanalization is predominately due to unsuccessful guidewire crossing. In particular, the unique characteristics of tortuous and deeply located large vessels in the retroperitoneal cavity create challenging endovascular procedures. Real-time guidance based on external direct vessel visualization might be a promising tool for successful recanalization of noncalcific CTO. Here, we describe the practical use of duplex echo-guidance during the procedural course of iliac CTO recanalization.",

    "abstract": "Surgical aortic fenestration has been used for treating ischemic complications of acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD). In the current endovascular era, surgical aortic fenestration may serve as an alternative for these patients after percutaneous failure. The purpose of this study is to describe our surgical suprarenal and infrarenal aortic fenestration technique, and to report the long-term outcomes of this approach in the management of complicated ABAD.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the in-hospital and long-term outcomes of 18 patients treated with either suprarenal (n = 10) or infrarenal surgical fenestration (n = 8) for complicated ABAD between 1988 and 2002. Suprarenal fenestration was performed through a thoracoabdominal incision in the 10th intercostal space, whereas patients treated with infrarenal fenestration underwent a midline laparotomy. A longitudinal aortotomy was performed and the true and false lumens were identified, followed by a wide resection of the intimal membrane.\nMedian age was 60 years (range, 48-82 years) and 89% (n = 16) were male. The in-hospital mortality was 22% (n = 4), which included two deaths after suprarenal fenestration and two deaths after infrarenal fenestration. In the remaining patients, full visceral, renal, and lower extremity function was recovered, except for 1 patient with paraplegia at admission in which the neurologic deficit was permanent. Median follow-up of the surviving patients was 10.0 years (interquartile range, 12.5; range, 0.5-20 years). During follow-up, none of the patients developed renal or visceral ischemia, or ischemic complications to the lower extremities, and no significant dilatations of the treated aortic segments were noted. Three of 14 patients with ABAD who were discharged alive expired during the follow-up period due to causes unrelated to the surgical procedure.\nSurgical aortic fenestration represents an effective and durable option for treating ischemic complications of ABAD. Actually, this conservative surgical technique may serve as the alternative treatment in case of contraindications or failure of endovascular management of complicated ABAD.",

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated in a murine model that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of pitavastatin into vascular endothelial cells effectively increased therapeutic neovascularization. For the development of a clinically applicable approach, further investigations are necessary to assess whether this novel system can induce the development of collateral arteries (arteriogenesis) in a chronic ischemia setting in larger animals.\nChronic hind limb ischemia was induced in rabbits. They were administered single injections of nanoparticles loaded with pitavastatin (0.05, 0.15, and 0.5 mg/kg) into ischemic muscle.\nTreatment with pitavastatin nanoparticles (0.5 mg/kg), but not other nanoparticles, induced angiographically visible arteriogenesis. The effects of intramuscular injections of phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-loaded nanoparticles, pitavastatin (0.5 mg/kg), or pitavastatin (0.5 mg/kg) nanoparticles were examined. FITC nanoparticles were detected mainly in endothelial cells of the ischemic muscles for up to 4 weeks. Treatment with pitavastatin nanoparticles, but not other treatments, induced therapeutic arteriogenesis and ameliorated exercise-induced ischemia, suggesting the development of functional collateral arteries. Pretreatment with nanoparticles loaded with vatalanib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abrogated the therapeutic effects of pitavastatin nanoparticles. Separate experiments with mice deficient for VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase demonstrated a crucial role of VEGF receptor signals in the therapeutic angiogenic effects.\nThe nanotechnology platform assessed in this study (nanoparticle-mediated endothelial cell-selective delivery of pitavastatin) may be developed as a clinically feasible and promising strategy for therapeutic arteriogenesis in patients.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated short-term and long-term outcomes in patients with abdominal aortic infection (mycotic aneurysm, prosthetic graft infection, aortoenteric fistula) managed by total excision of the aneurysm or the infected vascular graft and in situ aortic reconstruction with a cryopreserved arterial homograft (CAH).\nFrom January 2000 to December 2008, 110 consecutive patients underwent CAH implantation for treatment of vascular infections. In 57 (52%), in situ revascularization of the abdominal aorta with Y-prosthesis constructed from CAHs was performed. Early outcome included 30-day mortality and the levels of daily blood markers (leucocytes, C-reactive protein, and platelets) during the postsurgical 10-day period. We reported long-term survival and freedom from reoperation rates, including all indications for reoperation.\nIndications for operation were infected vascular graft in 31 patients (55%), aortodigestive fistulae in 11 (19%), nonruptured mycotic aneurysms in 4 (7%), and ruptured mycotic aneurysms of abdominal aorta in 11 (19%). In 39 of 57 patients (68%), the intraoperative specimens were positive for at least one microorganism, and Staphylococcus aureus was present in 14 (25%). In 32 patients (82%) with intraoperative specimens positive for microorganisms, there was no evidence of the intraoperatively detected microorganisms in the postoperative specimens (wound, blood culture, and drainage fluid). The peak value of leucocytes (13.7 +/- 4.4 x 10(3)/L) and C-reactive protein (200 +/- 75 mg/L) occurred on postoperative day 3. Platelets reached the lowest value on postoperative day 2 (178 +/- 67 x 10(9)/L). Median peak body temperature was 37.7 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C. Thirty-day mortality was 9% (5 of 57 patients). Median follow-up was 36 months (range, 4-118 months); 3-year survival was 81%, and freedom from reoperation was 89%. Five patients (9%) required reoperation, in one patient each for postoperative bleeding, acute cholecystitis, homograft occlusion, homograft-duodenum fistula, and aneurysmal degeneration. No recurrence of infection was reported.\nThese results demonstrate an encouraging outcome after cryopreserved allograft implantation for the treatment of vascular infections in the abdominal aorta. The data represent a basis for future comparisons with other treatment modalities for vascular infections, including silver-coated prostheses and autogenous femoral veins.",

    "abstract": "Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis, the use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters when anticoagulation has failed or when contraindicated remains a safe and effective treatment. Greenfield (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) and TrapEase (Cordis, Bridgewater, NJ) filters are arguably among the most popular filtration devices. The Greenfield filter (12F introducer) has been in use for >30 years and has been well studied. The TrapEase filter (6F introducer) has been used since 2000, with a limited number of studies. Good guidelines to help determine which filter to use in any given situation are lacking; therefore, this randomized study prospectively compared the clinical outcomes (access-site thrombosis, filter thrombosis, and symptomatic pulmonary embolism [PE]) between these filters.\nBetween July 2006 and November 2008, 156 patients (63 men, 93 women; mean age, 75 years; range, 38-101 years) were randomized: 84 to Greenfield and 72 to TrapEase IVC filter insertion in the infrarenal position using angiographic guidance. Postoperative follow-up comprised serial lower extremity and IVC/iliac vein (IV) duplex imaging (78.2%) at day 1, week 1, every 3 months for the first year, and every 6 months for the second year; clinical evaluation, and clinic visits. During this period, 349 patients (143 men, 206 women; mean age, 75 years; range, 24-96 years) were not randomized.\nThe indications for filter placement, in the 156 randomized patients, were gastrointestinal bleeding, 37; intracranial hemorrhage, 12; free-floating clot, 19; failure of anticoagulation, 29; PE, 27; prophylactic, 4; and others, 32. During a mean 12-month follow-up (range, 0-39 months), symptomatic IVC/IV thrombosis developed in five patients (6.94%) in the TrapEase group and none in the Greenfield group (P = .019). No filter migration, access-site thrombosis, misplacement, or IVC perforation occurred. Recurrent PE was suspected in one of the five patients with IVC/IV thrombosis. Overall mortality was 42.3% (66 patients), and 30-day mortality was 13.5% (21 patients: 10 TrapEase, 11 Greenfield). The study was initially designed to recruit 360 patients in both TrapEase and Greenfield filters in 2 years to demonstrate any statistical significance but was prematurely concluded due to the interim results.\nA higher rate of symptomatic IVC/IV thrombosis is associated with TrapEase filter placement. However, the TrapEase filter still has a selective clinical role in the prevention of thromboembolism in selected patients who are coagulopathic. This is the first randomized prospective study comparing IVC filters since their inception in 1967.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the durability of nitinol stent placement in high-risk patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) and infrapopliteal lesions after suboptimal balloon angioplasty.\nBetween January 2006 and January 2009, 53 high-risk patients (24 women; mean age, 71.8 +/- 5.1 years) with CLI underwent infragenicular stent placement with a 4F sheath-compatible self-expanding nitinol stent. Patients had three or more serious cardiopulmonary comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery occlusive disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists score >/=3, previous myocardial infarction, coronary stent or bypass, or infection after peripheral revascularization. Endovascular therapy was performed in 30 stenoses and 23 occlusions in 53 patients. The mean stenosis length was 5.5 +/- 1.9 cm. The mean occlusion length was 6.5 +/- 2.9 cm. The mean follow-up was 24.1 +/- 7.3 months and consisted of clinical examination, ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements, and duplex ultrasound imaging. Digital subtraction angiography was performed if restenosis or reocclusion was suspected.\nThe technical success rate was 98.1%. The 24-month cumulative primary patency rate was 75.5%. During the follow-up, two patients underwent successful repeat angioplasty, and four patients required crural bypass. The 24-month secondary patency and freedom from amputation rates were 88.7% and 88.7%, respectively. The mean ABI increased significantly at 12 and 24 months (P < .001). Risk stratification to detect predictors that influenced the patency rate showed that proximal lesions had significant better patency than distal crural lesions (83.3% vs 65.2%, P = .04). The morphology of the lesions (stenoses vs occlusions, P = .88) did not seem to influence primary patency. Four patients died from nonprocedure-related causes during the follow-up, including lung cancer, myocardial infarction, and glioblastoma multiforme. No procedure-related deaths were recorded.\nThe 2-year outcome of our series underscores the value of infrapopliteal nitinol stent placement as a durable bailout treatment option in high-risk CLI patients with suboptimal angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Incidental abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are identified during imaging for other reasons. Incidental AAAs are important findings because they require monitoring and surgical treatment, when indicated, to prevent rupture. The prevalence of incidental AAAs and their management has not been extensively studied.\nWe electronically screened a 25% simple random sample of abdominal computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies conducted between 1996 and 2008 at one academic medical center. Screen-positive reports were manually reviewed to determine if they showed an incidental AAA. We reviewed the medical records of all in-patients to determine whether the incidental AAA was documented, a treatment plan was identified, and whether it was communicated to the patient's family physician through the discharge summary. We used evidence-based recommended schedules to determine the adequacy of AAA monitoring for each person.\nIn 79,121 abdominal images, we identified 812 incidental AAAs (1.0% of all studies) or 364 incidental AAAs annually (95% confidence interval [CI], 349-379). Patients were elderly (mean age, 74 years), and AAAs were a mean diameter of 4.0 cm. For 174 inpatients, AAAs were noted in only 51 patients (29%) and only 25 (15%) were communicated to the family physician. Of 329 patients who were observed beyond their first recommended follow-up scan, only 51 (16%) were monitored appropriately throughout their entire follow-up; the median proportion of follow-up time with recommended monitoring was 56% (interquartile range, 32%-82%). Elective AAA repair was done in 98 patients (13%), the probability of which was significantly increased when AAA monitoring frequency was compliant with that recommended in practice guidelines. Six patients (0.8%) were admitted with aortic rupture, the probability of which was independent of AAA monitoring.\nIncidental AAAs are common and appear to be poorly monitored. Our data suggested that improved monitoring of incidental AAAs was independently associated with elective AAA repair.

Chronic symptoms difficult to discern from neurogenic compression were present in 27 patients (66%; 24 had subclavian stenoses or PSD, or both, 1 had subclavian occlusion, and 2 had axillary artery compression); 13 (32%) presented with acute ischemia (11 had aneurysms and 2 had PSDs), and 1 asymptomatic patient had a subclavian aneurysm. Osteoarticular anomalies were found in 27 patients (66%), including 19 cervical ribs, 4 first rib anomalies, and 4 clavicular or first rib fractures, or both. Among 27 patients with subclavian aneurysms or PSD, 21 (78%) had a bone anomaly. Arterial pathology was deemed significant in 30 patients (73%) and mild or moderate in 11 (21%). Symptoms in 23 of these patients were compatible with neurogenic compression without clinical suspicion of arterial pathology, but 13 (56%) harbored a significant arterial anomaly.\nThe incidence of arterial pathology secondary to compression at the TO may be underestimated, and in the absence of obvious ischemia, significant arterial pathology may not be suspected. Two-thirds of patients with arterial compression have associated bone anomalies. Therefore, routine arterial imaging seems advisable for patients evaluated for TO syndrome in the presence of a bone anomaly at the TO or an examination that shows an arterial abnormality. In the absence of these signs, however, arterial pathology may be overlooked in patients with symptoms suggestive of neurogenic compression. Further study is needed to elucidate the incidence, natural history, and clinical relevance of arterial compression and PSD at the TO.",

    "abstract": "With increased use of subintimal angioplasty (SIA), the role of reintervention after recurrence is currently unknown. To more clearly define the technical feasibility, patency, and clinical outcomes of reinterventions after SIA, we reviewed our cumulative experience.\nA retrospective review of patient information (including demographics, indications, procedures, noninvasive arterial studies, and postprocedural events) was performed on those patients undergoing reintervention after a primary subintimal angioplasty in the infrainguinal vessels. Continuous and noncontinuous data were compared using the Student t-test and the z test, respectively. Patency was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Survival curves were compared using log-rank and Wilcoxon testing for univariate analysis and Cox hazard-regression analysis for multivariate analysis.\nFrom December 2002, through July 2006, 495 SIAs were performed for infrainguinal disease in 482 patients. Of this cohort, 121 patients (25%) required 188 consecutive reinterventions. Each patient underwent an average of 1.5 +/- 0.8 (range, 1-7) reinterventions during this study. We analyzed only the outcomes of 124 consecutive, first reinterventions. Mean interval time between primary SIA and the first reintervention was 7.8 +/- 6.8 months (range, 1 day-31 months). Indications for reintervention were clinical only (recurrence of symptoms or worsening exam), diagnostics only (recurrence based on peripheral vascular lab studies), or both in 18%, 25%, and 52% of patients, respectively. Technical success was achieved in 94% (n = 117) of the procedures. Repeat SIA technique was utilized in 68% (n = 84) of reinterventions and other endovascular therapies (32%; n = 40), of which the majority were transluminal angioplasty, for the remaining reinterventions. Mean follow-up was 8.6 months (range, 0-34 months). The patency rate at 1 year for the first reintervention was 33%. One-year patency rates for reinterventions performed within 3 months of the primary SIA were worse than those performed after 3 months (22% vs 34%; P = .04). In addition, patients treated for claudication had better 1-year patency than those treated for critical limb ischemia (37% vs 27%; P = .03). Other demographic or procedural variables did not significantly affect patency. In patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), limb salvage rate at 1 year was 71%.\nEndovascular reintervention after SIA is a safe and technically feasible procedure for recurrences and offers good limb salvage rate. Early reinterventions performed within 3 months of the original SIA portend a worse outcome. In addition, reinterventions are less durable in patients with CLI compared with claudication. Finally, by identifying a recurrent stenosis instead of an occlusion, close surveillance may contribute to improved overall outcome.",

    "abstract": "Hypothermia is widely used to mediate ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with repair of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Experiments were designed in a murine model of thoracic aortic ischemia-reperfusion (TAR) to evaluate the effect of moderate systemic hypothermia on neurologic function, spinal cord morphology, and indices of inflammation in critical organs.\nC57BL/6 mice were subjected to TAR under hypothermic (34 degrees C) or normothermic (38 degrees C) conditions, followed by 24 or 48 hours of normothermic reperfusion. Neurologic functions were assessed during reperfusion. Spinal cords were examined at 24 and 48 hours after reperfusion, and the degree of injury qualified by counting the number of viable motor neurons within the anterior horns. Keratinocyte chemokine, interleukin-6, and myeloperoxidase levels were measured from lung, liver, and kidney at 24 and 48 hours.\nNormothermic TAR resulted in a dense neurologic deficit in all mice throughout the reperfusion period. Mice subjected to TAR under hypothermic conditions had transient, mild neurologic deficit during the initial periods of reperfusion. Between 24 and 48 hours, delayed paralysis developed in half of these mice, whereas the other half remained neurologically intact. Spinal cord histology showed a graded degree of injury that correlated with neurologic function. There was no correlation between markers of inflammation in various organs and neurologic outcomes following TAR.\nSystemic moderate hypothermia was protective against immediate paralysis after TAR in all cases and was associated with delayed paralysis in 50% of mice. This study suggests that delayed-onset paralysis may be the result of a local insult, rather than a systemic inflammatory event, precipitating spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "Cryoplasty has been proposed as a different therapy to address the problems of recurrent lesions. We reviewed our experience with cryoplasty to determine its outcome treating patients with lesions in native vessels and within stents.\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing cryotherapy between 2004 and 2008 was conducted. Patency was defined by at least one of the following criteria: flow through the vessel demonstrated by angiography or duplex ultrasonography, maintenance of an ankle-brachial index (ABI) greater than 0.10 above the preprocedural value, or maintenance of a palpable pedal pulse that was absent before the procedure in an asymptomatic patient. Patency, limb salvage, symptomatic improvement, and freedom from surgical bypass were determined with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared by log-rank testing. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional-hazards regression.\nEighty-eight cryoplasty procedures were performed in 71 patients, with 35 procedures for in-stent restenosis and 37 for native vessel disease. Sixteen of 88 procedures in grafts were excluded from analysis secondary to combined disease process and/or bypass graft stenosis. Lesions treated with cryoplasty had an average of 2.9 prior endovascular interventions. Eighty-five percent of the lesions were described as complex (multifocal, diffuse, or occlusion) and the mean lesion length was 15 +/- 10 cm. Initial cryoplasty technical success rate was 68% (25 of 37) for native vessels and 71% (25 of 35) for in-stent procedures. One year primary patency for the native vs stent group was 17% vs 28%, respectively (P = .18).

The 1-year secondary patency for the native vs stent group was 41% vs 57% (P = .42), respectively. Freedom from claudication at 1 year for the native vs stent group was 32% vs 21% (P = .80). Compared to balloon angioplasty, cryoplasty has an averaged up-cost of $1851.50 per procedure.\nCryoplasty was used in patients with extensive disease and multiple prior interventions. Cryoplasty provided poor patency rates and poor relief from claudication at 1 year in this population.

    "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysms are characterized by extravascular circulation and therefore may lead to an activation of the coagulation cascade. We investigated d-dimer levels in patients with and without postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms and hypothesized that d-dimer levels correlate with the presence of pseudoaneurysms at the vascular access site.\nPatients with clinical suspected groin pseudoaneurysms after transluminal procedures were eligible. We compared prospectively-collected laboratory values of quantitative d-dimer testing in patients with and without pseudoaneurysms as assessed by color-coded duplex sonography. Furthermore, we measured the peak systolic velocity at the arterial fistula of each pseudoaneurysm.\nIn 48 (40%) of 120 consecutive patients, a pseudoaneurysm was found. The level of d-dimer values was significantly higher in patients with postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms compared with controls (1.9 microg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 1.34-2.78 microg/mL] vs 0.8 microg/mL [IQR, 0.53-1.14 microg/mL]; P < .001).

We also found a significant correlation of the peak systolic velocity at the arterial fistula and increasing d-dimer levels (r = 0.98, P < .0001).\nWe found a significantly higher level of d-dimer values in patients with femoral pseudoaneurysms at the vascular access site. Therefore, d-dimer levels could be a potential serological marker in the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms. A confirmation is warranted in a larger patient sample.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive endoluminal therapy for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease is commonplace, but the outcomes of current management of recurrent disease have not been well defined. This study examined the outcomes of endoluminal and open interventions for recurrent SFA disease.\nA database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA between 1986 and 2008 was retrospectively queried, and those with recurrent disease were selected. Outcomes were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used for time-dependent variables.\nSymptomatic SFA disease resulted in endovascular treatment in 735 limbs in 631 patients (64% male; average age, 67 years). The restenosis rate was 16% +/- 3% at 5 years. Restenosis developed in 222 patients, of whom 58 remained asymptomatic and 164 underwent repeat intervention comprising percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in 59% and bypass in 41%. Bypass was used for critical ischemia (rest pain/tissue loss: 52% repeat PTA vs 75% bypass) and in more extensive recurrent disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus [TASC] II C/D lesions: 42% repeat PTA vs 67% bypass). Primary and repeat PTA had mean +/- standard error of the mean equivalent cumulative patency (73% +/- 9% vs 73% +/- 3% at 5 years) and duration of symptom relief (66% +/- 3% vs 63% +/- 6%). Bypass had significantly superior outcomes for patency (93% +/- 8%) and symptom relief (81% +/- 8%), but morbidity was 28% vs 16% for PTA. Critical ischemia, TASC-II lesion (C/D), and one-vessel tibial runoff were significant predictors of failure in the repeat PTA group.\nReintervention is required in a minority of patients selected for SFA angioplasty. Bypass for recurrent disease is used more commonly for extensive disease and is associated with superior long-term outcomes but higher mortality. Bypass rather than repeat PTA may be the better strategy for progressive, complex recurrent disease.",

    "abstract": "Replacing heparin with bivalirudin has been beneficial in patients undergoing coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass. The use of this alternative anticoagulant during peripheral bypass operations has not been studied. Concerns over distal thrombosis using this direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) prompted a single-arm, open-label, pilot prospective trial of bivalirudin in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass to assess perioperative safety and efficacy.\nBetween 2006 and 2007, 18 patients met criteria for enrollment and underwent primary lower extremity bypass using bivalirudin. All patients had severe symptomatic atherosclerotic disease requiring lower extremity bypass. Bivalirudin at a bolus dose of 0.75 mg/kg and continuous infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hr was used as the sole anticoagulant.\nPatients (mean age, 67 years) underwent femoral-popliteal (n = 14) or femoral-tibial (n = 4) bypass preferentially using saphenous vein (83%). Mean operative time was 261 minutes, with bivalirudin infusion time of 95 +/- 26 minutes (mean +/- standard deviation). Reliable anticoagulation was achieved with weight-based dosing with activated clotting time values at baseline (systemic) of 131 +/- 92 seconds, during infusion (systemic) of 347 +/- 36 seconds, and from the distal vasculature (limb) of 345 +/- 66 seconds. Distal limb bivalirudin levels were stable at 9755 +/- 3860 ng/mL during clamp occlusion. Mean estimated blood loss was 332 +/- 191 mL with four patients (22%) requiring blood products. One patient required revision of the proximal anastomosis during the initial hospitalization. At 30 days, all bypass operations were patent with improvement of mean ankle-brachial index from 0.57 to 0.81. There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions, or amputations in the 30-day postoperative period. Based on the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction classification for bleeding, one patient had major bleeding (>2 units of packed red blood cells), and three patients had minor bleeding within the first 30 days.\nBivalirudin is a safe and effective anticoagulant for lower extremity bypass operations. Thrombosis beyond the distal clamp was not seen. A comparative trial to standard anticoagulation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The initial treatment for intermittent claudication is supervised exercise therapy (SET). Owing to limited capacity and patient transports costs of clinic-based SET, a concept of SET provided by local physiotherapists was developed. We hypothesized that provision of daily feedback with an accelerometer in addition to SET would further increase walking distance.\nThis multicenter randomized trial was set in vascular surgery outpatient clinics and included 304 patients with intermittent claudication. Patients were randomized to exercise therapy in the form of \"go home and walk\" advice (WA), SET, or SET with feedback. Local physiotherapists provided SET. The primary outcome measure was the change in absolute claudication distance. Secondary outcomes were the change in functional claudication distance and results on the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey after 12 months.\nIn 11 centers, 102, 109, and 93 patients were included, respectively, in the WA, SET, and SET with feedback groups, and data for 83, 93, and 76, respectively, could be analyzed. The median (interquartile range) change in walking distance between 12 months and baseline in meters was 110 (0-300) in the WA group, 310 (145-995) in the SET group, and 360 (173-697) in the SET with feedback group (P < .001 WA vs SET). WIQ scores and relevant domains of the SF-36 improved statistically significantly in the SET groups.\nSET is more effective than WA in improving walking distance, WIQ scores, and quality of life for patients with intermittent claudication. Additional feedback with an accelerometer did not result in further improvement. SET programs should be made available for all patients with intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "It is difficult to reliably predict abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion and rupture in individuals. There is increasing interest in the role of patient-specific biomechanical profiling of AAA development and rupture. This review examines evidence to support the use of biomechanical profiling in AAA.\nThe literature was systematically reviewed to examine the evidence to support the role of patient-specific biomechanical profiles in the management of patients with AAA. A search of Medline, Medline in process and other nonindexed citations, and EMBASE was performed for articles published from January 1980 to December 2008. The search strategy retrieved 2410 titles. After exclusions, 83 articles were reviewed in full and form the basis of this review.\nThere is increasing evidence that patient-specific biomechanical factors may be more reliable in predicting AAA rupture than currently available clinical and biochemical parameters. Wall stress determination using finite element analysis is consistently higher in symptomatic and ruptured AAA. Recent improvements in computational methodology and advances in imaging and processing technology have increased the power of these biomechanical factors in predicting AAA expansion and rupture.\nMajor progress has been made in the development of biomechanical profiles for AAA. Large population-based studies for validation of patient-specific biomechanical profiles with rupture risk assessment and tailored decision making are now indicated, particularly with the introduction of AAA screening programs.",

    "abstract": "Dialysis-associated steal syndrome with rest pain and ischemic nonhealing ulcers dictates prompt surgical intervention. Distal revascularization with interval ligation is extensive surgery for frail patients in whom calcified distal arteries make anastomosis difficult. Simple banding is appropriate in high-flow fistulas. In low-flow accesses, further flow reduction by simple banding may result in inadequate dialysis and cause thrombosis. However, banding between puncture sites maintains a pressure gradient between the arterial and venous puncture sites that enables adequate flow with effective hemodialysis that would not be possible with banding at the anastomosis. This new technique is a good solution for maintaining access patency and increasing digital pressure while avoiding complicated surgical revisions in high-risk patients.",

Angulation of the target vessel relative to the arch is an obstacle to success with this technique. In this report, we describe a case of successful in situ fenestration of the left subclavian artery (LSA) in a patient with an aortic arch aneurysm, treated with an endovascular stent graft. We outline a novel technique using through and through wire access and a pre-curved semi-rigid sheath, which allows successful access to the lumen of the aortic stent graft, despite an acute angle at the take-off of the LSA.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is increasingly being used as a treatment alternative to endarterectomy (CEA) for patients with significant carotid stenosis. However, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has indicated that CAS is associated with a significantly higher burden of microemboli. This study evaluated the potential effect on intellectual functions of new DWI lesions after CEA or CAS.\nThis prospective study analyzed the neuropsychologic outcomes after revascularization in 24 CAS and 31 CEA patients with severe carotid stenosis compared with a control group of 27 healthy individuals. All patients underwent clinical examinations, magnetic resonance imaging scans, and a neuropsychologic test battery that assessed six major cognitive domains performed immediately before CEA or CAS, \u2264 72 hours after, and at 3 months.\nNew DWI lesions were detected among 15 of 21 (71%) of the CAS patients immediately after treatment but in only 1 of the 28 CEA patients (4%; P < .01). As a group, patients with new DWI lesions showed a decline in their performance in the cognitive domains, attention, and visuoconstructive functions within 72 hours of carotid revascularization. Individually, however, in none of the cognitive domains did the decreases reach a clinically relevant threshold of z < -1.5. Moreover, the cognitive performance was not significantly different between patients with and without new DWI lesions 3 months after treatment. The cognitive performance was similar between CEA and CAS patients at all points.\nThe findings support the assumption that new brain lesions, as detected with DWI after CAS or CEA, do not affect cognitive performance in a manner that is long-lasting or clinically relevant. Despite the higher embolic load detected by DWI, CAS is not associated with a greater cognitive decline than CEA.",

    "abstract": "In response to the need for a disease severity measurement, the American Venous Forum committee on outcomes assessment developed the Venous Severity Scoring system in 2000. There are three components of this scoring system, the Venous Disability Score, the Venous Segmental Disease Score, and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). The VCSS was developed from elements of the CEAP classification (clinical grade, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology), which is the worldwide standard for describing the clinical features of chronic venous disease. However, as a descriptive instrument, the CEAP classification responds poorly to change. The VCSS was subsequently developed as an evaluative instrument that would be responsive to changes in disease severity over time and in response to treatment. Based on initial experiences with the VCSS, an international ad hoc working group of the American Venous Forum was charged with updating the instrument. This revision of the VCSS is focused on clarifying ambiguities, updating terminology, and simplifying application. The specific language of proven quality-of-life instruments was used to better address the issues of patients at the lower end of the venous disease spectrum. Periodic review and revision are necessary for generating more universal applicability and for comparing treatment outcomes in a meaningful way.",

    "abstract": "Delayed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is a well recognized complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We wanted to evaluate the frequency, etiology, and outcomes of delayed AAA rupture following EVAR, and identify treatment options that facilitate improved survival.\nFrom 2002 to 2009, 1768 patients underwent elective and emergent EVAR. At a mean follow-up of 29 months, 27 (1.5%) patients presented with delayed AAA rupture and required repair by either open surgical conversion or endovascular means. All data were prospectively collected in a vascular registry, and outcomes analyzed.\nOver a mean follow-up of 29 months, the incidence of delayed AAA rupture after elective EVAR was 1.4% (24 of 1615 patients), and after emergent EVAR for ruptured AAA was 2.8% (3 of 106 patients). Of the 27 delayed AAA rupture patients, 20 (74%) were considered \"lost to follow-up,\" and, at presentation, 17 (63%) patients had Type 1 endoleak with stent graft migration, three (11%) had Type 1 endoleak without stent graft migration, five (19%) had Type 2 endoleak, and two (7%) had undetermined etiology for aneurysm rupture. Fifteen (55%) patients underwent open surgical repair via retroperitoneal approach with partial (n = 8; 53%) or complete (n = 7; 47%) stent graft explants and aortoiliac reconstruction, 11 (41%) patients underwent a second EVAR, and one (4%) patient refused treatment and died. Supraceliac aortic clamp was required in three (20%) patients with open surgical conversion, and supraceliac occlusion balloon was required in two (18%) patients with EVAR. There were three (11%) postoperative deaths; two following open surgical conversion and one following EVAR. One additional redo-EVAR patient has undergone successful elective conversion to open surgical repair for persistent type II endoleak and increase in AAA size.\nDelayed AAA rupture following EVAR can be successfully managed in most patients by open surgical conversion or secondary EVAR. The approach to each patient should be individualized; complete stent graft explant is not necessary in most patients; a secondary EVAR for delayed AAA rupture with or without an elective conversion to open surgical repair remains a viable option. Vigilant routine follow-up is needed for all patients after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Postthrombotic syndrome is characterized by a fibrotic vein injury following deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We sought to quantify the change in vein wall thickness in patients who fail to resolve DVT by 6 months and whether there were differences in blood or plasma levels of inflammatory proteins associated with venous remodeling.\nPatients presenting with confirmed lower extremity DVT were prospectively recruited for this study. Duplex imaging of the lower extremity venous system was performed, and blood was collected at entrance and repeat evaluation with blood draw and ultrasound imaging at 1 and 6 months. DVT resolution and thickness of the vein wall was quantified by ultrasound imaging in each segment affected by thrombus, and a contralateral, unaffected vein wall served as a control. Gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers were examined from leukocytes and serum, respectively. Analysis of variance or Student t-tests were used, and a P < .05 was significant. N = 10 to 12 for all analyses.\nThirty-two patients (12 patients with DVT resolution at 6 months, 10 patients with persistent thrombus at 6 months, and 10 healthy controls) were compared. Both resolving and nonresolving DVT were associated with a 1.5- to 1.8-fold increased vein wall thickness at 6 months (P = .008) as compared with nonaffected vein wall segments. However, the thickness of the affected segments was 1.4-fold greater in patients who had total resolution of the DVT by 6 months than in patients who had persistent chronic thrombus 6 months after presentation (P = .01). There was a four- to five-fold increased level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) antigen in thrombosed patients compared with nonthrombosed patient controls (P < .05), while Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR-9) gene expression was three-fold less than controls (P < .05) at enrollment. D-dimer and P-selectin were higher in thrombosed as compared to controls at diagnosis but not at 6 months. Both TLR-4 (marker of inflammation) and P-selectin gene expression were higher in leukocytes from patients with chronic DVT compared with those who resolved at 1 month after diagnosis (P < .05).\nThis preliminary study suggests ongoing vein wall remodeling after DVT, measurable by ultrasound and associated with certain biomarkers. At 6 months, the vein wall is markedly thickened and directly correlates with resolution. This suggests that the vein wall response is initiated early following thrombus formation and persists even in the presence of total resolution.",

    "abstract": "Foam generated by manual agitation of liquid sclerosant with air or gas is routinely utilized to treat refluxing veins. Although generally well tolerated, serious neurological events have been reported. The composition and properties of the foam, including bubble size and gaseous components, may contribute to the potential for microcirculatory obstruction and cerebral ischemia. We tested an ultra-low nitrogen polidocanol endovenous microfoam with controlled bubble size and density and hypothesized that patients at risk due to the presence of middle cerebral artery (MCA) bubble emboli during microfoam injection would not demonstrate evidence of clinical or subclinical cerebral infarction.\nPatients with great saphenous vein incompetence were treated with ultra-low nitrogen (\u2264 0.8%) polidocanol endovenous microfoam injected under ultrasound guidance. Patients with right-to-left shunt were included to evaluate the safety of cerebral arterial bubbles. All patients with MCA emboli detected by transcranial Doppler during endovenous microfoam ablation received intensive surveillance for microinfarction, including brain magnetic resonance imaging and measurement of cardiac troponin-I.\nMCA bubble emboli were detected in 60 of 82 treated patients; 22 patients had no detectable emboli. Among patients with MCA bubbles detected, 49 (82%) had \u2264 15 bubbles. No patients developed magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, neurological signs, or elevated cardiac troponin.\nPatients treated with foamed liquid sclerosants are commonly exposed to cerebrovascular gas bubbles. In this series of 60 high-risk patients with MCA bubble emboli during or after treatment with ultra-low nitrogen polidocanol endovenous microfoam, there was no evidence of cerebral or cardiac microinfarction. The results of this study cannot be generalized to foams compounded using bedside methodologies, since the composition of these foams is substantially different.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of patients who are on systemic anticoagulation with warfarin require endovenous thermal ablation for reflux disease in the great saphenous vein (GSV). Little is known about the effects of anticoagulation on periprocedural bleeding and long-term closure rates of the treated veins. This study evaluated the effects of uninterrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing endovenous thermal ablation.\nIn this prospective observational study, 88 limbs of patients on warfarin (anticoagulation group [AG]) who underwent endovenous thermal ablation for GSV reflux disease were compared with 92 limbs in patients receiving no anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents (control group [CG]). Forty percent of AG patients were also receiving antiplatelet therapy. Periprocedural bleeding and closure rate at 1 year were evaluated.\nNo major bleeding occurred in either group. Minor bleeding was noted in 8 of 88 procedures in the AG vs 4 of 92 in the CG (P = 0.24); all in patients receiving radiofrequency ablation. Four of the eight minor bleeds in the AG were noted in patients receiving \"triple therapy\" with warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel or ticlopidine. Triple therapy in the AG was associated with a higher risk of minor bleeding compared with the CG (relative risk, 13.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.10-41.19, P < .001). All treated venous segments remained closed at the 1-year follow-up in both groups.\nIn this relatively small, nonrandomized study comparing endovenous thermal ablation in patients with and without warfarin, no differences were found in periprocedural risk of major bleeding or closure rate of the treated venous segments. Minor bleeding was increased in patients receiving triple therapy with warfarin, aspirin, and a thienopyridine who underwent radiofrequency ablation.",

    "abstract": "Radial-cephalic fistulas (RCFs) perianastomotic stenoses (PASs) are on and around the fistula anastomosis. This group of lesions encompasses juxta-anastomotic stenosis (stenosis located on the venous side within 3 cm away from the anastomosis), anastomotic, and arterial stenosis. The purpose of our study was to assess the postintervention primary patency and assisted postintervention primary patency (APP) rates for surgery and angioplasty when treating these stenoses. The secondary endpoint was to identify factors that might influence the procedure's patency rates.\nThis retrospective study included 73 consecutive patients treated for lack of maturation PASs between January 1999 and December 2005 in two interventional centers. Patients' mean age was 65 years old. Stenoses were treated by surgery (n = 21) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; n = 52). Surgery meant creation of a new anastomosis excluding the area of stenosis. Preoperative characteristics including the patient's age, gender, comorbidities, stenosis location, and length were not statistically different between the two groups. The mean follow-up was 39 months for PTA and 49 months for surgery.\nAnatomical and clinical success rates were 86% and 90% for surgery, and 75% and 92% for PTA. At 1 year, the primary patency rates were 71 \u00b1 10% for surgery and 41 \u00b1 6% for PTA, respectively (P < .02). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to assisted primary patency (95% vs 92%). In the PTA group, stenosis location at the anastomosis itself was a risk factor of early recurrence (P = .047). The complication rate was similar between surgery and PTA.\nOur results suggest that the treatment of anastomotic stenoses should be surgical rather than endovascular. Angioplasty and surgery have shown similar results when used to treat other perianastomotic stenoses, but repeat procedures were more frequent with angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement criteria for carotid artery stenting (CAS) require that patients be high surgical risk or enrolled in a clinical trial. This may bias comparisons of CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We evaluate mortality and stroke following CAS and CEA stratified by medical high risk criteria.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2004-2007) was queried by ICD-9 code for CAS and CEA with diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis. Medical high risk criteria were identified for each patient including patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass and/or valve repair (CABG/V) during the same admission. Symptom status was defined by history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and/or amarosis fugax. The primary outcome was postoperative death, stroke (complication code 997.02), and combined stroke or death, stratified by high risk vs non-high risk status and symptom status.\nPatient totals of 56,564 (10.5%) CAS and 482,394 (89.5%) CEA were identified. Half of the patients in each group were high risk. CABG/V was performed less commonly with CAS than CEA (2.8% vs 4.0%, P < .001). Patients undergoing CAS were more likely symptomatic than those undergoing CEA (13.1% vs 9.4%, P < .001). Mortality was higher after CAS than CEA for both high risk and non-high risk patients. Stroke was also higher after CAS for both high risk and non-high risk patients. Combined stroke or death was higher after CAS again for both high risk (asymptomatic 1.5% vs 1.2%, P < .05, symptomatic 14.4% vs 6.9%, P < .001) and non-high risk (asymptomatic 1.8% vs 0.6%, P < .001, symptomatic 11.8% vs 4.9%, P < .001). Combined stroke or death for patients undergoing CABG/V during the same admission was similar for CAS and CEA (4.8% vs 3.2%, P = .19). Multivariate predictors of combined stroke or death adjusted for age and gender included CAS vs CEA (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, P < .001), symptom status (OR 6.8, P < .001), high risk (OR 1.6, P < .001), and earlier year of procedure (OR 1.1, P < .01).\nIn the United States from 2004 to 2007, CAS has a higher risk of stroke and death than CEA after adjustment for medical high risk criteria. Further analysis with prospective assessment of risk factors is needed to guide appropriate patient selection for CEA and CAS in the general population.",

    "abstract": "The present study was aimed at developing a new cell-permeant peptide inhibitor (MK2i) of the kinase that phosphorylates and activates heat-shock protein (HSP)27 (MAPKAP kinase II), and evaluating the ability of this peptide to inhibit HSP27 phosphorylation and intimal thickening.\nThe ability of MK2i to reduce HSP27 phosphorylation and cell migration was evaluated in A7R5 cells stimulated with arsenite or lysophosphatidic acid. Stable isotopic labeling using amino acids in cell culture, in combination with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, was used to characterize the effect of MK2i on global protein expression in fibroblasts. The effect of MK2i on intimal thickening and connective tissue growth factor expression was evaluated in human saphenous vein (HSV) rings maintained with 30% fetal bovine serum for 14 days by light microscopy and immunoblotting.\nPretreatment of cells with MK2i (10 \u03bcM) prior to arsenite or lysophosphatidic acid stimulation decreased phosphorylation of HSP27 (36% \u00b1 9% and 33% \u00b1 10%, respectively) compared with control (not pretreated) cells. MK2i also inhibited A7R5 migration, and downregulated the transforming growth factor-induced expression of collagen and fibronectin in keloid cells, two major matrix proteins involved in the development of intimal hyperplasia. Treatment of HSV segments with MK2i enhanced relaxation, reduced HSP27 phosphorylation (40% \u00b1 17%), connective tissue growth factor expression (17% \u00b1 5%), and intimal thickness (48.2% \u00b1 10.5%) compared with untreated segments. On the other hand, treatment with a recombinant fusion protein containing a cell-permeant peptide attached to the HSP27 sequence increased intimal thickness of HSV segments by 48% \u00b1 14%.\nOur results suggest that HSP27 may play a role in the development of processes leading to intimal hyperplasia in HSV, and reduction of HSP27 phosphorylation by MK2i may be a potential strategy to inhibit the development of intimal hyperplasia in HSV to prevent the autologous vascular graft failure.",

    "abstract": "A healthy 46-year-old woman presented to our hospital with complaints of sudden and repeated episodes of syncope without accompanying signs or symptoms. Neurological investigation proved negative and a 24-hour Holter monitoring device revealed significant nocturnal cardiac pauses. As such, a pacemaker was implanted in the patient, which was effective at preventing the syncopes. A subsequent investigation led to the undertaking of a cervical computed tomography (CT) scan that showed the existence of a right carotid body tumor. Rotational flexing or stretching of the neck immediately triggered the start of the pacemaker. The tumor was surgically removed and the patient no longer felt the activation of the pacemaker, which was removed 6 months after the operation. One year later, the patient was found to be well and completely free of her previous symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Due to increased use and improvements in diagnostic imaging studies, spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (SISMAD), which is a rare vascular event, has been reported to occur on a more frequent basis. Although there have been some anecdotal case reports describing the underlying pathology of SISMAD, the etiology of the majority of SISMAD is still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the underlying cause of SISMAD.\nFrom July 2001 to March 2010, 51 consecutive patients with SISMAD (symptomatic 39, asymptomatic 12) and 38 patients with combined aortic and superior mesenteric artery dissection (CASMAD) were identified in a single institution by retrospective investigations. Diagnosis was dependent on multi-detector helical computed tomography (CT) scan. To find clinical characteristics of SISMAD, we compared demographic, clinical, and lesion (site of entry tear, type, length) characteristics between the two groups. To find any flow dynamic abnormalities at the proximal segment of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), we conducted flow dynamic studies using computational fluid dynamic models (V.12; ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, Pa). Streamline patterns and wall shear stress distributions were tested with computer simulation models using three different branching angles of SMA from the abdominal aorta.\nCompared to CASMAD, SISMAD was more common in men (90.2% vs 71.1%; P = .02), less frequently associated with hypertension (31.4% vs 65.8%; P = .001), and more frequently associated with intra-abdominal cancers (11.8% vs 0%; P = .036). In a fluid dynamic study using computational fluid dynamic models, we found abnormal mechanical stresses at the anterior wall around the convex portion of the SMA.\nDevelopment of SISMAD seems to be less likely the result of hypertension or connective tissue disease but more likely due to hemodynamic force caused by convex curvature.",

    "abstract": "To compare articulated and nonarticulated early walking aids (EWAs) for clinical and quality-of-life outcomes in transtibial amputees.\nPatients undergoing lower limb amputation in a tertiary-care vascular surgical unit were screened over a 4-year period. Recruited patients were randomized to receive articulated amputee mobility aid (AMA) or nonarticulated pneumatic postamputation mobility aid (PPAMA) during early rehabilitation. Primary (10-meter walking velocity) and secondary clinical (number and duration of physiotherapy treatments during EWA/prosthesis use) and quality-of-life (SF-36) outcome measures were recorded at five standardized assessment visits. Inter-group and intra-group analyses were performed.\nTwo hundred seventy-two patients were screened and 29 transtibial amputees (median age, 56 years) were recruited (14/treatment arm). No significant difference was seen in demographics and comorbidities at baseline. Inter-group analysis: Median 10-meter walking velocity was significantly (Mann-Whitney, P = .020) faster in the PPAMA group (0.245 m/s, interquartile range [IQR] 0.218-0.402 m/s) compared with the AMA group (0.165 m/s; IQR, 0.118-0.265 m/s) at visit 1. However, there was no difference between the groups at any other visit. Similarly, the number of treatments using EWA was significantly (P = .045) lower in the PPAMA group (5.0; IQR, 3.5-8.0) compared with the AMA group (6.0; IQR, 6.0-10.5). No difference was observed between the groups in duration of physiotherapy or SF-36 domain and summary scores. Intra-group analysis: Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in 10-meter walking velocity (Friedman test; AMA P = .001; PPAMA P = .007); however, other clinical outcomes did not show any statistically significant improvement. Only physical function domain of SF-36 demonstrated significant improvement (Friedman test; AMA P = .037; PPAMA P = .029).\nThere is no difference in clinical and QOL outcomes between articulated and nonarticulated EWAs in rehabilitation of transtibial amputees.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) has been attempted for acute aortic emergencies (AAEs). However, the risk factors for achieving good results have not been identified. Besides focusing on Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score as a general indicator of patient condition, we analyzed both preoperative factors and intraoperative/postoperative factors. The purpose of this study was to identify those factors affecting the results of TEVAR using our Matsui-Kitamura stent graft (MKSG) for AAEs involving descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.\nBetween July 2000 and June 2008, a total of 32 patients (23 men, 9 women) with AAEs underwent endovascular repair. AAE was a result of aortic aneurysm rupture in 16 cases, rupture of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer in 2 cases, traumatic aortic injury in 9 cases, complicated type B dissection in 4 cases, and aortic infiltration of sarcoma in 1 case. Low blood pressure in 6 patients, acute renal failure in 7 patients, anemia due to bleeding in 12 patients were found at the time of operation. Urgent TEVAR using the MKSG was performed. Perioperative and long-term results for these patients were investigated.\nThe delivery and technical success rate for TEVAR using the MKSG, was 100%. Perioperative mortality was 12.5%, and 5-year survival rate was 71%. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, the APACHE II score clarified a risk factor. Among the various elements of an APACHE II score, age, hematocrit, and total score were identified as significant factors. The mean of an APACHE II score was 9.5. Patients with an APACHE II score \u2265 10 showed significantly lower 5-year survival rates than patients with an APACHE II score \u2264 9.\nGood results were obtained using TEVAR to treat AAEs with MKSGs, both perioperatively and during medium-term follow-up. Evaluation of risk factors for TEVAR of AAEs showed the utility of APACHE II score (particularly age, hematocrit, and total score) with a score \u2265 10 indicating high risk.",

Since radiation is an invisible threat in endovascular interventions, attention to protection may be challenging for the surgeon to understand and enforce.\nGeneral endovascular radiation considerations for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and peripheral interventions are reviewed.\nPeripheral atherectomy has the highest estimated skin doses of all endovascular procedures. Renal interventions, visceral balloon angioplasty and stenting, and embolization procedures are some of the procedures that have the highest peak skin doses. Patients with high body mass index (BMI) have been found to have up to three times higher peak skin doses than patients with normal BMI.\nThe degree of radiation exposure is dependent on the type of endovascular procedure, the patient's body habitus, and also the safety habits of the surgeon. Radiation exposure needs addressed in an informed consent process as is required for other procedures. Radiation exposure risks also need monitoring just as a surgeon monitors individual morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to document the results of bleomycin A5 sclerotherapy for cervicofacial lymphatic malformations (LMs), and the clinical data of 65 patients between October 2004 and October 2007 were reviewed.\nOf the 65 patients in the study, 60 patients were given intralesional injection of bleomycin A5. Five patients underwent partial resection, and then an injection of bleomycin A5 for the remaining lesion. The outcomes were assessed by physical examination and Doppler ultrasonography scan. The follow-up time was from 6 months to 3 years after the last injection (mean, 16 months).\nAmong the 65 patients, 41 were men and 24 were women (1.7:1 male:female ratio), the age range was 3 months to 45 years (mean, 12 years). Thirty-two lesions (49%) were macrocystic, 30 (46%) were microcystic, and 3 (5%) were combined. Each patient received 1 to 10 injections (mean, 3.0 injections) for the whole course of treatment, and the total dose of bleomycin A5 was from 8 to 80 milligrams (mean, 24.0 mg). Twenty-six of 32 macrocystic lesions (81%) showed greater than 90% reduction, whereas another 6 (19%) exhibited 50% to 90% reduction. Nineteen of 30 microcystic lesions (63%) showed greater than 90% reduction; 10 (33%) had 50% to 90% reduction; and 1 (4%) had less than 50% size reduction. Of the 3 combined lesions, 2 (67%) had greater than 90% shrinkage, and 1 (3%) had less than 50% reduction. The complications included ulceration of oral mucosa, minor soft tissue atrophy, mild fever, and hematoma. There was no recurrence throughout the follow-up period.\nThese data suggest bleomycin A5 is a safe and effective intralesional agent for the treatment of macrocystic LMs, superficial oral mucosa LM, and localized deep microcystic lesions. For extensive macrocystic LMs involving contiguous anatomic areas and diffuse microcystic lesions involving deep tissues, bleomycin A5 injection combined with resection is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) can prevent pulmonary embolism (PE); however, indications for use vary. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) 2002 guidelines suggest prophylactic IVCF use in high-risk patients, but the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2008 guidelines do not. This analysis compares cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vs therapeutic retrievable IVCF placement in high-risk trauma patients.\nMarkov modeling was used to determine incremental cost-effectiveness of these guidelines in dollars per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) during hospitalization and long-term follow-up. Our population was 46-year-old trauma patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) by EAST criteria to whom either the EAST (prophylactic IVCF) or ACCP (no prophylactic IVCF) guidelines were applied. The analysis assumed the societal perspective over a lifetime. For base case and sensitivity analyses, probabilities and utilities were obtained from published literature and costs calculated from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedules, the Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project database, and Red Book wholesale drug prices for 2007. For data unavailable from the literature, similarities to other populations were used to make assumptions.\nIn base case analysis, prophylactic IVCFs were more costly ($37,700 vs $37,300) and less effective (by 0.139 QALYs) than therapeutic IVCFs. In sensitivity analysis, the EAST strategy of prophylactic filter placement would become the preferred strategy in individuals never having a filter, with either an annual probability of VTE of \u2265 9.6% (base case, 5.9%), or a very high annual probability of anticoagulation complications of \u2265 24.3% (base case, 2.5%). The EAST strategy would also be favored if the annual probability of venous insufficiency was <7.69% (base case, 13.9%) after filter removal or <1.90% with a retained filter (base case, 14.1%). In initial hospitalization only, EAST guidelines were more costly by $2988 and slightly more effective by .0008 QALY, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $383,638/QALY.\nAnalysis suggests prophylactic IVC filters are not cost-effective in high-risk trauma patients. The magnitude of this result is primarily dependent on probabilities of long-term sequelae (venous thromboembolism, bleeding complications). Even in the initial hospitalization, however, prophylactic IVCF costs for the additional quality-adjusted life years gained did not justify use.",

    "abstract": "In the early postoperative evaluation of the success of arterial revascularization, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and other noninvasive tests lack reliability, especially in patients with incompressible arteries or local edema. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging of limb muscle perfusion may be an alternative to standard tests if it detects treatment success reliably.\nWe compared a simplified CEUS method with clinical staging, pulse volume recording (PVR), and ABI in patients with lifestyle-limiting peripheral arterial disease undergoing revascularization by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or bypass surgery. Patients underwent staging, PVR, ABI, and CEUS before, directly after, and 3 to 5 months after successful PTA (n = 20) or successful bypass grafting (n = 14). For CEUS, contrast agent was injected into an antecubital vein, and the time from beginning to peak intensity of contrast enhancement (TTP) in the calf muscle was measured.\nSuccessful revascularization by both PTA and bypass was associated with a significant improvement in staging, PVR, ABI, and TTP directly after intervention and at follow-up. Median ABI increased from 0.60 to 0.85 (P = .001) after PTA and from 0.36 to 0.76 (P = .003) after bypass surgery. Median TTP decreased from 45 seconds to 24 seconds (P = .015) and from 30 seconds to 27 seconds (P = .041), respectively. McNemar analysis revealed unidirectional changes in both ABI and TTP (P = .625 after PTA and P = 1.000 after bypass surgery), and equivalence analysis showed 95% confidence intervals within clinical indifference, indicating that TTP was equivalent to standard tests in detecting successful revascularization.\nContrast ultrasound perfusion imaging of calf muscle after arterial revascularization may be a valuable alternative to standard noninvasive tests such as ABI or PVR to determine the success of an arterial revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and morbid obesity have been shown to increase wound infections and occasionally mortality after many surgical procedures. Little is known about the relative impact of body mass index (BMI) on these outcomes after open (OAR) and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe 2005-2007 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), a multi-institutional risk-adjusted database, was retrospectively queried to compare perioperative mortality (in-hospital or 30-day) and postoperative wound infections after OAR and EVAR. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and operative details were analyzed. Obesity was defined as a BMI >30 kg/m(2) and morbid obesity as a BMI >40 kg/m(2). Outcomes were compared with t test, Wilcoxon rank sum, \u03c7(2), and multivariate logistic regression.\nThere were 2097 OARs and 3358 EVARs. Compared with EVAR, OAR patients were younger, more likely to be women (26% vs 17%, P < .001), and less obese (27% vs 32%, P < .001). Mortality was 3.7% after OAR vs 1.2% after EVAR (risk ratio, 3.1; P < .001), and overall morbidity was 28% vs 12%, respectively (relative risk, 2.3; P < .001). Morbidly obese patients had a higher mortality for both OAR (7.3%) and EVAR (2.4%) than obese patients (3.9% OAR; 1.5% EVAR) or nonobese patients (3.7% OAR; 1.1% EVAR). Obese patients had a higher rate of wound infection vs nonobese after OAR (6.3% vs 2.4%, P < .001) and EVAR (3.3% vs 1.5%, P < .001). Morbid obesity predicted death after OAR but not after EVAR, and obesity was an independent predictor of wound infection after OAR and EVAR.\nMorbid obesity confers a worse outcome for death after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Obesity is also a risk factor for infectious complications after OAR and EVAR. Obese patients and, particularly, morbidly obese patients should be treated with EVAR when anatomically feasible.",

    "abstract": "Delayed paraplegia after operation on the thoracoabdominal aorta is considered to be related to vulnerability of motor neurons to ischemia. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuronal vulnerability and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after transient ischemia in the spinal cord. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), a chemical chaperone that reduces the load of mutant or unfolded proteins retained in the ER during cellular stress, can protect against ischemic spinal cord damage.\nSpinal cord ischemia was induced in rabbits by direct aortic cross-clamping (below the renal artery and above the bifurcation) for 15 minutes at normothermia. Group A (n = 6) was a sham operation control group. In group B (n = 6) and group C (n = 6), vehicle or 15 mg/kg/h of sodium 4-PBA was infused intravenously, respectively, from 30 minutes before the induction of ischemia until 30 minutes after reperfusion. Neurologic function was assessed at 8 hours, and 2 and 7 days after reperfusion with a Tarlov score. Histologic changes were studied with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry analysis for ER stress-related molecules, including caspase12 and GRP78 were examined.\nThe mean Tarlov scores were 4.0 in every group at 8 hours, but were 4.0, 2.5, and 3.9 at 2 days; and 4.0, 0.7, and 4.0 at 7 days in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The numbers of intact motor neurons at 7 days after reperfusion were 47.4, 21.5, and 44.9 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. There was no significant difference in terms of viable neurons between groups A and C. Caspase12 and GRP78 immunoreactivities were induced in motor neurons in group B, whereas they were not observed in groups A and C.\nReduction in ER stress-induced spinal cord injury was achieved by the administration of 4-PBA. 4-PBA may be a strong candidate for use as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of ischemic spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "Takayasu arteritis (TA) is an autoimmune disease with an unclear etiology and pathophysiology. An antibody-mediated inflammatory response is a known feature of this disease, however, the role of circulating B-lymphocyte production of such antibodies is not known. The objective of this study is to characterize in vitro production of autoimmune antibodies by B-lymphocytes from patients with TA and to examine differences related to disease activity.\nPeripheral blood samples were taken from 72 patients with TA and 50 age-matched controls. Among the patients with TA, 42 had active disease while 31 had inactive disease. The Sharma modified criteria were used for diagnosis, and the National Institutes of Health criteria were used for TA activity assessment. Levels of autoantibodies in culture supernatant of circulating B-lymphocytes, including anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA), anti-cardiolipin antibody (ACA), anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I antibody (a\u03b2\u2082GPI), and anti-annexin V antibody (AAVA), were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in each participant.\nIn vitro levels of AECA, ACA, a\u03b2\u2082GPI, and AAVA from circulating B-lymphocytes were significantly increased in TA patients compared with controls (AECA: 0.6 \u00b1 0.36 vs 0.18 \u00b1 0.09, P < .001; ACA: 0.69 \u00b1 0.22 vs 0.54 \u00b1 0.13, P < .001; a\u03b2\u2082GPI: 0.99 \u00b1 0.19 vs 0.83 \u00b1 0.07, P< .001; AAVA: 0.62 \u00b1 0.26 vs 0.41 \u00b1 0.44, P < .001). In vitro levels of AECA, ACA, and AAVA from circulating B-lymphocytes in active TA were higher than those in inactive TA (AECA: 0.85 \u00b1 0.29 vs 0.28 \u00b1 0.10, P < .001; ACA: 0.79 \u00b1 0.21 vs 0.56 \u00b1 0.15, P < .001; AAVA: 0.82 \u00b1 0.16 vs 0.36 \u00b1 0.06, P < .001). No difference was found in the in vitro level of a\u03b2\u2082GPI between active TA and inactive TA (1.01 \u00b1 0.17 vs 0.96 \u00b1 0.22, P = .115). In vitro levels of AECA, ACA, and AAVA from circulating B-lymphocytes in inactive TA showed no statistic difference with those in controls (AECA: 0.28 \u00b1 0.10 vs 0.18 \u00b1 0.09, P = .096; ACA: 0.56 \u00b1 0.15 vs 0.54 \u00b1 0.13, P = .699; AAVA: 0.36 \u00b1 0.06 vs 0.41 \u00b1 0.44, P = .200).

Differences in production from those with active versus inactive disease suggest that phenotypic alterations in this cell type may play an important role in pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Surgical revascularization of the lower extremity using bypass grafts to distal target arteries is an established, effective therapy for advanced ischemia. Recent multicenter data confirm the primacy of autogenous vein bypass grafting, yet there remains significant heterogeneity in the utilization, techniques, and outcomes associated with these procedures in current practice. Experienced clinical judgment, creativity, technical precision, and fastidious postoperative care are required to optimize long-term results. The patient with diabetes and a critically ischemic limb offers some specific challenges; however, numerous studies demonstrate that the outcomes of vein bypass surgery in this population are excellent and define the standard of care. Technical factors, such as conduit, and inflow/outflow artery selection play a dominant role in determining clinical success. An adequate caliber, good quality great saphenous vein (GSV) is the optimal graft for distal bypass in the leg. Alternative veins perform acceptably in the absence of GSV, whereas prosthetic and other non-autogenous conduits have markedly inferior outcomes. Graft configuration (reversed, non-reversed, or in situ) seems to have little influence on outcome. Shorter grafts have improved patency. Inflow can be improved by surgical or endovascular means if necessary, and distal-origin grafts (eg, those arising from the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries) can perform as well as those originating from the common femoral artery. The selected outflow vessel should supply unimpeded runoff to the foot, conserve conduit length, allow for adequate soft tissue coverage of the graft, and simplified surgical exposure. This review summarizes the available data linking patient selection and technical factors to outcomes, and highlights the importance of surgical judgment and operative planning in the current practice of infrainguinal bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy (EVT) has increasingly become the initial clinical option for treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD), not only for patients with claudication, but also for those with critical limb ischemia. Despite this major clinical practice paradigm shift, the outcomes of EVT for PAD are difficult to evaluate and compare with established surgical benchmarks because of the lack of prospective, randomized trials, incomplete characterization of indications for intervention, mixing of arterial segments and extent of disease treated, the multiplicity of EVT techniques used, the exclusion of early treatment failures, crossover to open bypass during follow-up, and the frequent lack of intermediate and long-term patency and limb salvage rates in life-table format. These data limitations are especially problematic when one tries to assess the outcome of EVT in patients with diabetes. The purpose of the present report is to succinctly review and objectively analyze available data regarding the results of EVT in patients with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Precise, comprehensive imaging of the arterial circulation is the cornerstone of successful revascularization of the ischemic extremity in patients with diabetes mellitus. Arterial imaging is challenging in these patients because the disease is often multisegmental with a predilection for the distal tibial and peroneal arteries. Occlusive lesions and the arterial wall itself are often calcified and patients presenting with ischemic complications frequently have underlying renal insufficiency. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA), contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and more recently, computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) have been used as imaging modalities in lower extremity ischemia. Each has specific advantages and shortcomings in this patient population, which will be summarized and contrasted in this review. DSA is an invasive technique most often performed from a femoral arterial puncture and requires the injection of arterial contrast, which can occasionally cause allergic reactions. In patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency, contrast infusion can result in worsening renal failure; although usually self-limited, it may occasionally require hemodialysis, especially in patients with diabetes. However, DSA provides the highest degree of spatial resolution and image quality. It is also the only modality in which the diagnosis and treatment of arterial disease can be performed simultaneously. MRA is noninvasive, and when enhanced with gadolinium contrast injection provides arterial images of comparable quality to DSA and in some circumstances may uncover distal arterial targets not visualized on DSA. However, spatial resolution is inferior to DSA and erroneous interpretations due to acquisition artifacts are common. Specialized equipment and imaging techniques are necessary to minimize their occurrence in the distal lower extremity. In addition, due to the risk of inducing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, gadolinium-enhanced MRA cannot be used in patients with renal insufficiency. CTA is noninvasive and rapidly performed, with better spatial resolution than MRA, but requires the largest volume of contrast infusion, exposes patients to high-doses of radiation, and is subject to interpretive error due to reconstruction artifacts especially in heavily calcified arteries, limiting its usefulness in many patients with diabetes. For patients in whom the planned intervention is a surgical bypass, DSA and MRA will provide high quality images of the lower extremity arterial anatomy. For patients in whom a catheter-based intervention is the likely treatment, a diagnostic DSA immediately followed by a catheter-based treatment in the same procedure is the preferred approach. In patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, in which gadolinium-enhanced MRA is contraindicated, DSA or CTA can be performed. However, patients should have an infusion of intravenous normal saline solution or sodium bicarbonate before the procedure to reduce the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "The timely and accurate noninvasive assessment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a critical component of a limb preservation initiative in patients with diabetes mellitus. Noninvasive vascular studies (NIVS) can be useful in screening patients with diabetes for PAD. In patients with clinical signs or symptoms, NIVS provide crucial information on the presence, location, and severity of PAD, as well as an objective assessment of the potential for primary healing of an index wound or a surgical incision. Appropriately-selected NIVS are important in the decision-making process to determine whether and what type of intervention might be most appropriate, given the clinical circumstances. Hemodynamic monitoring is likewise very important following either an endovascular procedure or a surgical bypass. Surveillance studies, usually with a combination of physiologic testing and imaging with duplex ultrasound, accurately identify recurrent disease prior to the occurrence of thrombosis, allowing targeted reintervention. NIVS can be broadly grouped into three general categories: physiologic or hemodynamic measurements; anatomic imaging; and measurements of tissue perfusion. These types of tests and suggestions for their appropriate application in patients with diabetes are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic foot disease frequently leads to substantial long-term complications, imposing a huge socioeconomic burden on available resources and health care systems. Peripheral neuropathy, repetitive trauma, and peripheral vascular disease are common underlying pathways that lead to skin breakdown, often setting the stage for limb-threatening infection. Individuals with diabetes presenting with foot infection warrant optimal surgical management to effect limb salvage and prevent amputation; aggressive short-term and meticulous long-term care plans are required. In addition, the initial surgical intervention or series of interventions must be coupled with appropriate systemic metabolic management as part of an integrated, multidisciplinary team. Such teams typically include multiple medical, surgical, and nursing specialties across a variety of public and private health care systems. This article presents a stepwise approach to the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections with special emphasis on the appropriate use of surgical interventions and includes the following key elements: incision, wound investigation, debridement, wound irrigation and lavage, and definitive wound closure.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic foot infections are a common and often serious problem, accounting for a greater number of hospital bed days than any other complication of diabetes. Despite advances in both antibiotic therapy and surgical management, these infections continue to be a major risk factor for amputations of the lower extremity. Although a number of wound size and depth classification systems have been adapted for use in codifying diabetic foot ulcerations, none are specific for infection. In 2003, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot developed guidelines for managing diabetic foot infections, including the first severity scale specific for these infections. The following year, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published their Diabetic Foot Infection Guidelines. In this article, we review some of the critical points from the Executive Summary of the IDSA document and provide a commentary following each issue to update the reader on any pertinent changes that have occurred since the publication of the original document in 2004. The importance of a multidisciplinary limb salvage team, apropos this special joint issue of the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Society for Vascular Surgery, cannot be overstated.",

    "abstract": "Throughout our medical training, we are taught how to manage patients who present with symptoms, which usually leads to a clinical examination, a diagnosis, and a management plan. However, virtually no time is spent on teaching how to manage patients who have no symptoms because they have lost the ability to feel pain; that is, they have peripheral neuropathy. The lifetime incidence of foot ulceration in people with diabetes has been estimated to be as high as 25%, and a number of contributory factors result in a foot being at risk of ulceration. Most important amongst these factors is peripheral neuropathy, or the loss of the ability to feel pain, temperature, or pressure sensation in the feet and lower legs. Up to 50% of older patients with type 2 diabetes have evidence of sensory loss that puts them at risk of foot ulceration. If we are to succeed in reducing the high incidence of foot ulcers, regular screening for peripheral neuropathy is vital in all patients with diabetes. Those found to have any risk factors for foot ulceration require special education and more frequent review, particularly with podiatrists. The key message is therefore that neuropathic symptoms correlate poorly with sensory loss, and their absence must never be equated with lack of risk of foot ulceration. If we are to succeed in reducing the high incidence of foot ulceration and, particularly, recurrent ulceration, we must realize that with loss of pain there is also diminished motivation in the healing and the prevention of injury.",

    "abstract": "At the end of an anatomic peninsula, the foot in diabetes is prone to acute and chronic complications involving neuropathy, vasculopathy, and infection. Effective management requires an interdisciplinary effort focusing on this triad. In this article, we describe the key factors leading to foot complications and the critical skill sets required to assemble a team to care for them. Although specific attention is given to a conjoined model involving podiatry and vascular surgery, the \"toe and flow\" model, we further outline three separate models of care--basic, intermediate, and center of excellence--that can be implemented in the developed and developing world.",

    "abstract": "In 2007, the treatment of diabetes and its complications in the United States generated at least $116 billion in direct costs; at least 33% of these costs were linked to the treatment of foot ulcers. Although the team approach to diabetic foot problems is effective in preventing lower extremity amputations, the costs associated with implementing a diabetic foot care team are not well understood. An analysis of these costs provides the basis for this report.\nDiabetic foot problems impose a major economic burden, and costs increase disproportionately to the severity of the condition. Compared with diabetic patients without foot ulcers, the cost of care for patients with a foot ulcer is 5.4 times higher in the year after the first ulcer episode and 2.8 times higher in the second year. Costs for the treatment of the highest-grade ulcers are 8 times higher than for treating low-grade ulcers. Patients with diabetic foot ulcers require more frequent emergency department visits, are more commonly admitted to hospital, and require longer length of stays. Implementation of the team approach to manage diabetic foot ulcers within a given region or health care system has been reported to reduce long-term amputation rates from 82% to 62%. Limb salvage efforts may include aggressive therapy, such as revascularization procedures and advanced wound healing modalities. Although these procedures are costly, the team approach gradually leads to improved screening and prevention programs and earlier interventions, and thus seems to reduce long-term costs.\nTo date, aggressive limb preservation management for patients with diabetic foot ulcers has not usually been paired with adequate reimbursement. It is essential to direct efforts in patient-caregiver education to allow early recognition and management of all diabetic foot problems and to build integrated pathways of care that facilitate timely access to limb salvage procedures. Increasing evidence suggests that the costs for implementing diabetic foot teams can be offset over the long-term by improved access to care and reductions in foot complications and in amputation rates.",

    "abstract": "This historical perspective highlights some of the pioneers, milestones, teams, and system changes that have had a major impact on the management of the diabetic foot during the past 100 years. In 1934, American diabetologist Elliott P. Joslin noted that mortality from diabetic coma had fallen from 60% to 5% after the introduction of insulin, yet deaths from diabetic gangrene of the lower extremity had risen significantly. He believed that diabetic gangrene was preventable. His remedy was a team approach that included foot care, diet, exercise, prompt treatment of foot infections, and specialized surgical care.\nThe history of a team approach to management of the diabetic foot chronicles the rise of a new health profession, Podiatric Medicine and Surgery, as well as the emergence of the specialty of Vascular Surgery. The partnership between the diabetologist, vascular surgeon, and podiatrist is a natural one. The complementary skills and knowledge of each can improve limb salvage and functional outcomes. Comprehensive multidisciplinary foot care programs have been shown to increase quality of care and reduce amputation rates by 36% to 86%. The development of distal revascularization techniques to restore pulsatile blood flow to the foot has also been a major advancement.\nDiabetic foot patients are among the most complex and vulnerable of all patient populations. Specialized diabetic foot clinics of the 21st century should be multidisciplinary and equipped to coordinate diagnosis, off-loading, and preventive care; perform revascularization procedures; aggressively treat infections; and manage medical comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) have a high rate of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly when undergoing surgery. We sought to determine the effect of surgery and vascular disease on platelet and monocyte activation in vivo in patients with CLI.\nAn observational, cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary referral hospital in the southeast of Scotland. Platelet and monocyte activation were measured in whole blood in patients with CLI scheduled for infrainguinal bypass and compared with matched healthy controls, patients with chronic intermittent claudication, patients with acute myocardial infarction, and those undergoing arthroplasty (n = 30 per group). Platelet and monocyte activation were quantified using flow cytometric assessment of platelet-monocyte aggregation, platelet P-selectin expression, platelet-derived microparticles, and monocyte CD40 and CD11b expression.\nCompared with those with intermittent claudication, subjects with CLI had increased platelet-monocyte aggregates (41.7% +/- 12.2% vs 32.6% +/- 8.5%, respectively), platelet microparticles (178.7 +/- 106.9 vs 116.9 +/- 53.4), and monocyte CD40 expression (70.0% +/- 12.2% vs 52.4% +/- 15.2%; P < .001 for all). Indeed, these levels were equivalent (P-selectin, 4.4% +/- 2.0% vs 4.9% +/- 2.2%; P > .05) or higher (platelet-monocyte aggregation, 41.7% +/- 12.2% vs 33.6% +/- 7.0%; P < .05; platelet microparticles, 178.7 +/- 106.9 vs 114.4 +/- 55.0/microL; P < .05) than in patients with acute myocardial infarction. All platelet and monocyte activation markers remained elevated throughout the perioperative period in patients with CLI (P < .01) but not those undergoing arthroplasty.\nPatients undergoing surgery for CLI have the highest level of in vivo platelet and monocyte activation, and these persist throughout the perioperative period. Additional antiplatelet therapy may be of benefit in protecting vascular patients with more severe disease during this period of increased risk.",

    "abstract": "Axillosubclavian vein thrombosis, also known as Paget-Schroetter syndrome, is a rare presentation of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) representing approximately 5% of all cases. Conventional management consists of routine anticoagulation, operative decompression via first rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS), and, recently, thrombolysis. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively review our experience with this condition and compare the effectiveness of preoperative endovascular intervention with thrombolysis and venoplasty to anticoagulation alone in those undergoing FRRS to preserve subclavian vein patency.\nA retrospective review was conducted for all venous TOS patients from July 2003 to May 2009 from a prospectively maintained database. Preoperative clinic notes were reviewed to allow stratification into two groups. One group consisted of patients undergoing preoperative endovascular intervention with thrombolysis and venoplasty, while the other group consisted of patients managed medically with anticoagulation alone prior to FRSS. Operative notes, postoperative venograms, and postoperative duplex imaging results were reviewed for presence of recanalization, chronic nonocclusive thrombus, or continued occlusion.\nOne hundred three patients had 110 FRRS for subclavian vein thrombosis (53 men, 50 women), seven of which had contralateral FRRS for thrombosis. The cohort averaged 31 years of age (range, 16-54 years) with an overall, mean follow-up time of 16 months (range, 1-52 months). Of the 110 veins evaluated, 45 underwent endovascular intervention (thombolysis, with or without venoplasty) prior to FRRS, and at 1 year, 41 (91%) were patent with improvement of symptoms. In the 65 veins on anticoagulation alone, 59 (91%) ultimately were patent, with symptomatic improvement in all. Overall, 91% (100/110) of subclavian veins were patent in patients completing follow-up, were asymptomatic, and back to their previous active lifestyle.\nPreoperative endovascular intervention offered no benefit over simple anticoagulation prior to FRRS, since the use of thrombolysis prior to FRRS, regardless of need for postoperative venoplasty, had little impact on overall rates of patency. The optimal treatment algorithm may merely be routine anticoagulation for all effort thrombosis patients prior to FRRS followed by venography with venoplasty if needed. The role of thrombolysis for Paget-Schroetter syndrome should be further investigated in randomized trials.",

    "abstract": "New training paradigms in vascular surgery necessitate medical student interest in vascular disease. We examined the effects of incorporation of a vascular disease educational program during the second year of the medical school curriculum on student acquisition of knowledge and interest in the treatment of vascular disease.\nWe developed and administered a new educational program on vascular disease and delivered the program to all second-year medical students. The new program encompassed 9 didactic hours, including 7 traditional lecture hours and 2 hours of problem-based learning. After completing the program, students were surveyed regarding vascular disease-specific knowledge, interest in treating vascular disease, and career choices. Third-year students who were not exposed to the program were surveyed as a control group. We recorded the voluntary student enrollment in the vascular and endovascular surgery rotation during the following academic year. Voluntary enrollment of the students exposed to the vascular disease education program was compared with enrollment for the previous 8 years.\nBefore the introduction of the new educational program, 946 total lecture hours were delivered to first- and second-year medical students, comprising 490 hours (52%) given by nonsurgeon physicians, 445 (47%) by nonphysicians, and 11 (1%) by surgeons. Survey response rate was 93% (112 of 121) for second-year students and 95% (39 of 41) for third-year students. After the vascular disease program, second-year students answered 7.1 +/- 1.4 of 9 vascular disease questions correctly, whereas unexposed third-year students answered 7.2 +/- 1.7 questions correctly (P = .96). Most second-year medical students described a \"somewhat\" or \"much greater\" interest in the medical (63%), procedural (59%), and overall (63%) management of vascular disease after exposure to the program. Most also had a \"somewhat\" or \"much greater\" interest in a vascular medicine (64%) or vascular and endovascular surgery (60%) rotation. Enrollment in the vascular surgery third-year clerkship increased significantly to a mean of 3.0 students/month from 1.16 students/month in the prior year (P = .0032, postintervention year vs 8 prior years).\nA vascular disease educational program administered to second-year medical students increases interest in vascular disease and interest in further training. The increased interest translates to greater student enrollment in the vascular surgery clerkship in the subsequent academic year.",

    "abstract": "The case of a 20-year-old woman with a carotid body tumor of Shamblin class III is reported. Ten hours after preoperative direct intralesional embolization with 20 mL Onyx (ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer; Micro Therapeutics, Irvine, Calif), the patient showed symptoms of Horner syndrome and deficits of the hypoglossal and glossopharyngeal nerves. Intraoperative examination 12 hours after Onyx embolization revealed a massive swelling of the hypoglossal and glossopharyngeal nerves. The patient's tongue motility and glossopharyngeal function improved after surgery, but Horner syndrome was still present. Owing to the delayed occurrence of these adverse effects, the optimal time of surgical intervention after Onyx embolization should be discussed and perhaps expedited.",

    "abstract": "Great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence is the most common cause of superficial venous insufficiency. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) is superior to conventional ligation and stripping, and endovenous laser treatment (EVL) has emerged as an effective alternative to RFA. This randomized study evaluated RFA and EVL for superficial venous insufficiency due to GSV incompetence and compared early and 1-year results.\nBetween June 2006 and May 2008, patients with symptomatic primary venous insufficiency due to GSV incompetence were randomized to RFA or EVL. Patients with bilateral disease were randomized for treatment of the first leg and received the alternative method on the other. Pretreatment examination included a leg assessment using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and CEAP classification. Patients completed the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CIVIQ2). RFA was performed with the ClosurePlus system (VNUS Medical Technologies, Sunnyvale, Calif). EVL was performed with the EVLT system (AngioDynamics Inc, Queensbury, NY). Early (1-week and 1-month) postoperative results of pain, bruising, erythema, and hematoma were recorded. Duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging was used at 1 week and 1 year to evaluate vein status. VCSS scores and CEAP clinical class were recorded at each postoperative visit, and quality of life (QOL) using CIVIQ2 was assessed at 1 month and 1 year.\nThe study enrolled 118 patients (141 limbs): 46 (39%) were randomized to RFA and 48 (40%) to EVL, and 24 (20%) had bilateral GSV incompetence. At 1 week, one patient in the RFA group had an open GSV and was deemed a failure. More bruising occurred in the EVL group (P = .01) at 1 week, but at 1 month, there was no difference in bruising between groups. At 1 year, DU imaging showed evidence of recanalization with reflux in 11 RFA and 2 EVL patients (P = .002). The mean VCSS score change from baseline to 1 week postprocedure was higher for RFA than EVL (P = .002), but there was no difference between groups at 1 month (P = .07) and 1 year (P = .9). Overall QOL mean score improved over time for all patients (P < .001). CEAP clinical class scores of >or=3 were recorded in 21 RFA (44%) and 24 EVL patients (44%) pretreatment, but at 1-year, 9 RFA (19%) and 12 EVL patients (24%) had scores of >or=3 (P < .001). This represented a significant improvement in all patients compared with baseline.\nBoth methods of endovenous ablation effectively reduce symptoms of superficial venous insufficiency. EVL is associated with greater bruising and discomfort in the perioperative period but may provide a more secure closure over the long-term than RFA.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk.\nWe used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nWe observed a positive association with increasing years of smoking and cigarettes smoked and a negative association with smoking cessation. Excess weight was associated with increased risk, whereas exercise and consumption of nuts, vegetables, and fruits were associated with reduced risk. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had lower risk of AAA than whites and Native Americans. Well-known risk factors were reaffirmed, including male gender, age, family history, and cardiovascular disease. A predictive scoring system was created that identifies aneurysms more efficiently than current criteria and includes women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged <65 years. Using this model on national statistics of risk factors prevalence, we estimated 1.1 million AAAs in the United States, of which 569,000 are among women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged <65 years.\nSmoking cessation and a healthy lifestyle are associated with lower risk of AAA. We estimated that about half of the patients with AAA disease are not eligible for screening under current guidelines.

    "abstract": "The utilization of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) in suitable patients has resulted in decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality. Octogenarians as a subgroup have been more readily offered EVAR, as it is less invasive, and therefore presumably better tolerated than conventional open aortic repair. The purpose of this study is to investigate periprocedural and late EVAR outcomes in octogenarians compared with patients less than 80 years of age.\nFrom January 2003 to May 2008, 322 patients underwent EVAR. A total of 117 octogenarians were compared with 205 patients less than 80 years of age. A retrospective review of the demographic data, aneurysm details, perioperative morbidity, mortality, and late outcomes were analyzed.\nOctogenarians were significantly more likely to have a history of diabetes mellitus (51% vs 23%; P < .001), coronary artery disease (45% vs 32%; P = .0165), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (44% vs 30%; P = .0113), and renal insufficiency (57% vs 31%; P < .0001). There were no significant differences in the rates of perioperative myocardial infarction, stroke, death, intestinal, or arterial ischemic complications between the two groups. Octogenarians had a significant higher rate of pulmonary complications (5.1% vs 1%; P < .03) and access-site hematomas (12% vs 2.4%; P = .001) than younger patients. When all significant perioperative morbidity was combined, octogenarians were twice as likely to develop complications following EVAR than younger patients (27.4% vs 11.7%; P = .001). At 5-year follow-up, younger patients were twice as likely to develop type II endoleaks.\nEVAR can be performed safely and effectively in octogenarians, and the incidence of major complications including myocardial infarction, stroke, and death is unchanged compared with younger patients. However, there is a significantly increased rate of access-site hematomas, pulmonary, and perioperative complications in octogenarians as a whole. Our findings suggest EVAR remains a suitable form of therapy in the elderly group provided there is an appropriate preoperative evaluation and perioperative monitoring following repair.",

We systemically observed the vascular changes at the puncture segments of arteriovenous fistulas.\nThe native arteriovenous fistulas in 104 patients on maintenance hemodialysis using the buttonhole technique for puncture were studied. We used the duplex scan to observe the intimal lesions, the maximal diameters at the arterial and venous puncture segments, and the references.\nIntimal lesions were found in 42% and 40% of the arterial and venous puncture segments, none of which resulted in significant luminal stenosis. The differences between diameters at the arterial or venous puncture segments and the corresponding references were significant (arterial, 11.07 +/- 4.45 vs 6.85 +/- 2.35 mm, P < .001; venous, 8.82 +/- 4.13 vs 5.54 +/- 2.22 mm, P < .001).

    "abstract": "Octogenarians and even patients over 70 years old have unexplained poor outcomes with carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). We sought to evaluate whether older patients may have compromised intracranial collaterals and cerebral reserve and be intolerant to otherwise clinically silent emboli generated during CAS.\nOne thousand twenty-four cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies performed between 1991 and 2001 with stable xenon computed tomography scans (Xe/CT) were reviewed. CBF was measured before and after 1 gm intravenous acetazolamide (ACZ), a cerebral vasodilator. The normal response to ACZ is an increase in CBF. In areas of significant compromise of cerebral reserve (CR), CBF drops, representing a \"steal\" phenomenon. CBF changes were categorized as normal or abnormal and correlated with age, gender, cerebral symptoms, and with intracranial, carotid, or vertebral artery disease. Logistic regression was used to determine the effect of age on CR in the entire group and a subgroup of 179 patients with significant carotid stenosis of >50%.\nNine hundred sixteen studies were suitable for analysis. Carotid occlusion was predictive of decreased reserve (OR, 3.9; P = .03) regardless of age. There was also a trend toward lower reserve with severe carotid stenosis >70% (OR, 3) and in women (OR, 1.8; P = .08). Age >or=70 had no effect on reserve in the overall heterogeneous population with and without carotid disease and neither did a history of stroke, carotid, or intracranial stenosis. However, in 179 patients with significant carotid stenosis, age >or=70 was predictive of poor reserve (OR, 2.7; P = .03) and so was the presence of peripheral vascular disease (OR, 3.7; P = .03). A trend toward decreased reserve was also seen in women (OR, 2.3; P = .08).\nAge >or=70 is associated with poor cerebral reserve in patients with significant carotid stenosis as measured by CBF response to an ACZ challenge. Thus, patients >or=70 may be more sensitive to minor cerebral emboli, which may be one factor explaining their higher risk of stroke during CAS.",

    "abstract": "One-piece great saphenous vein (GSV) is the conduit of choice in infrainguinal revascularizations for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Unfortunately, adequate length of usable GSV is not always available. Despite inferior patency rates compared with GSV, prosthetic and arm vein conduits are generally considered usable. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of infrainguinal arm vein and prosthetic bypass.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 290 consecutive infrainguinal bypasses for CLI using arm vein conduit (n = 130) or prosthetic graft (n = 160) during January 2000 and December 2006 at our institution. The groups were compared for risk factors, indication for surgery, and runoff score. Survival, leg salvage, and patency rates were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nMedian surveillance time was 35 months (range 0-118 months). The age, gender, and usual risk factors were similar in arm vein and prosthetic groups, except cerebrovascular disease that was more common in the prosthetic group (P = .011). Indication for surgery was CLI. In the arm vein group, more than two-thirds (70.2%) of the procedures were for ischemic ulcer or gangrene, whereas in the prosthetic group the main indication was ischemic rest pain (51.3%). When the outcome of femoropopliteal bypasses was analyzed, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. However, in infrapopliteal revascularizations primary patency, assisted primary patency, and secondary patency rates at 3 years were significantly better in the arm vein group: 28.3% (SE +/- 6.3%) vs 9.6% (SE +/- 8.1%) (P = .031), 56.8% (SE +/- 6.6%) vs 10.4% (SE +/- 8.7%) (P = .000), and 57.4% (SE +/- 6.6) vs 11.2% (SE +/- 9.3%) (P = .000), respectively. Leg salvage and survival at 3 years were 75.0% (SE +/- 4.9%) vs 57.1% (SE +/- 8.8%) (P = .005) and 58.8% (SE +/- 5.1%) vs 39.5% (SE +/- 7.7%) (P = .007), respectively.\nArm vein conduits, even when spliced, are superior to prosthetic grafts in terms of midterm assisted primary patency, secondary patency, and leg salvage in infrapopliteal bypasses for CLI.",

However, in infrapopliteal revascularizations primary patency, assisted primary patency, and secondary patency rates at 3 years were significantly better in the arm vein group: 28.3% (SE +/- 6.3%) vs 9.6% (SE +/- 8.1%) (P = .031), 56.8% (SE +/- 6.6%) vs 10.4% (SE +/- 8.7%) (P = .000), and 57.4% (SE +/- 6.6) vs 11.2% (SE +/- 9.3%) (P = .000), respectively. Leg salvage and survival at 3 years were 75.0% (SE +/- 4.9%) vs 57.1% (SE +/- 8.8%) (P = .005) and 58.8% (SE +/- 5.1%) vs 39.5% (SE +/- 7.7%) (P = .007), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Within the context of healthcare system reform, the cost efficacy of lower extremity revascularization remains a timely topic. The impact of an individual patient's socioeconomic status represents an under-studied aspect of vascular care, especially with respect to longitudinal costs and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and clinical outcomes as well as inpatient hospital costs.\nA retrospective femoropopliteal revascularization database, which included socioeconomic factors (household income, education level, and payor status), in addition to standard demographic, clinical, anatomical, and procedural variables were analyzed over a 3-year period. Patients were stratified by income level (low income [LI] <200% federal poverty level [$42,400 for a household of 4], and higher income [HI] >200% federal poverty level) and revascularization technique (open vs endovascular) and analyzed for the endpoints of primary assisted patency, amortized cost-per-day of patency, and limb salvage. Data were analyzed with univariate and multivariate techniques.\nA total of 187 cases were identified with complete data for analysis, 146 in the LI and 41 in the HI cohorts. LI patients differed from HI patients by mean age (66.2 +/- 1.0 vs 61.8 +/- 1.5 years, P = .04), high school graduate rate (51.4% vs 85.4%, P < .001), presence of tissue loss (30.1% vs 14.6%, P = .05), female gender (43.7% vs 22.0%, P = .01) and preoperative statin use (45.8% vs 75.6%, P < .001). There were no differences with respect to other comorbidities including smoking status, presence of diabetes, renal insufficiency, anatomic factors or treatment modality (open vs endovascular). Ninety-seven patients underwent endovascular revascularization. The following outcomes were noted in the endovascular subset of LI and HI patients respectively: primary assisted patency (66% vs 71%, P = NS) and 12-month cost-per-day of patency ($166.30 +/- 77.40 vs $22.45 +/- 12.45, P = .05). Ninety-eight patients underwent open revascularization, with the following outcomes in LI and HI patients respectively: primary assisted patency (78% vs 86%, P = NS) and 12-month cost-per-day of patency ($319.43 +/- 225.44 vs $40.47 +/- 4.63, P = .07). Of the 77 patients with critical limb ischemia, 19 underwent eventual amputation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that income above 100% of the federal poverty line was protective against limb loss (odds ratio 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.51, P < .001).\nIncome level correlates with advanced presentation, advanced age, and lack of statin use. Although primary assisted patency rate is not affected by income status, an increased cost-per-day of patency and inferior limb salvage is found in lower income patients.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to identify risk factors for late mortality after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).\nA retrospective analysis of consecutive TEVAR was conducted. Medical record review, telephone contact, or query of the Social Security Death Index was used to determine 30-day and late survival. Late mortality was assessed with respect to patient characteristics at the time of the initial treatment, preoperative laboratory values, pathology, clinical presentation, and treatment adjuncts. Significant univariate predictors of death were entered into a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.\nFrom 1998 to 2009, 252 patients (149 men; mean age, 68 years) underwent TEVAR for degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA, n = 143), type B dissection (n = 62), mycotic aneurysm (n = 13), traumatic disruption (n = 12), penetrating ulcer or intramural hematoma (n = 10), anastomotic pseudoaneurysm (n = 4), or other pathology (n = 8). The 30-day mortality was 9.5%, with stroke or spinal cord injury in 5.6%. Mean follow-up was 22 +/- 22 months. Kaplan-Meier mean survival was 53 months. Predictors of late mortality by univariate analysis included age (P < .01), cardiac arrhythmia (P = .03), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .05), aneurysm diameter (P < .01), rupture (P < .01), debranching (P = .02), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10.0 x 10(3)/microL; P < .01), albumin, (P < .01), and creatinine > 1.7 mg/dL (P = .01). Multivariate predictors of mortality included rupture (hazard ratio [HR], 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-9.44; P = .03), debranching (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.09-4.24; P = .03), preoperative leukocytosis (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.39; P = .001), and aneurysm diameter (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P = .04). Subgroup analysis of patients undergoing TEVAR for asymptomatic, nonruptured TAA demonstrated that debranching (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.13-5.39; P = .02), White blood cell count (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40; P < .04), and aneurysm diameter (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05, P < .01) remain independently predictive of late mortality.\nPreoperative leukocytosis, aneurysm diameter, and concurrent debranching independently predict late mortality irrespective of clinical presentation and may assist in risk stratification.",

Patient symptoms included both claudication and limb threatening ischemia with or without tissue loss. Trans-Atlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC II) A (n = 18), B (n = 56), C (n = 11), and D (n = 15) lesions were included.

Patients were followed for 48 months. Follow-up evaluation included clinical assessment, physical examination, ankle-brachial indices, and color flow duplex sonography at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months.\nMean total lesion length of the treated arterial segment in the stent graft group was 25.6 cm (SD = 15 cm).

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is a promising means of treating patients with complicated type B aortic dissection by excluding the intimomedial tears. This study aims to characterize the location of tears and to propose a classification of type B aortic dissections based on these findings.\nAdvanced protocols in computed tomography scans of patients with type B aortic dissection were used to identify the size and location of intimomedial tears in relation to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Aortic imaging details in 72 un-operated patients were used as a reference standard. From 1999 to 2005, 44 patients underwent primary endovascular treatment for complications of type B aortic dissection.\nEach patient had an average of 2.8 +/- 2.11 intimomedial tears. The median intimomedial tear surface area was 0.63 cm(2). The presence of >or=3 or >or=5 intimomedial tears in the descending thoracic aorta did not correlate with aortic branch malperfusion (P > .05). Thirteen of 26 (50%) patients with a tear >1.9 cm(2) had aortic branch malperfusion (P = .032). Ten of 14 (71%) patients with a tear >4.86 cm(2) (mean plus one standard deviation) had aortic branch malperfusion (P = .002). The location of tears ranged from -6 mm to +459.2 mm from the left subclavian artery orifice: 80.5% (n = 99) of these tears were above the reference origin of the celiac artery. Eight of 13 patients (62%) with a tear distal to 282 mm (the orifice of the celiac artery) had aortic branch malperfusion in (P = .04). A classification for the location of intimomedial tears is proposed with potential clinical relevance to endovascular repair: type 1 has no identifiable tears; type 2 has one or more tears with no tears distal to the orifice of the celiac artery; type 3 has tears involving the branch vessels of the abdominal aorta; and type 4 has intimomedial tears distal to the aortic bifurcation.\nCharacterization and location of intimomedial tears using computed tomography (CT) imaging is feasible and represents an important step in the management of type B aortic dissection. The location and surface area of tears is associated with malperfusion. Based on the proposed classification and anatomic reference data, three out of every four patients may have a favorable constellation of intimomedial tears (type 1 or 2) that would be amenable to endovascular repair and reverse aortic remodeling. The clinical correlation will be established in upcoming studies.",

    "abstract": "Large databases can be a rich source of clinical and administrative information on broad populations. These datasets are characterized by demographic and clinical data for over 1000 patients from multiple institutions. Since they are often collected and funded for other purposes, their use for secondary analysis increases their utility at relatively low costs. Advantages of large databases as a source include the very large numbers of available patients and their related medical information. Disadvantages include lack of detailed clinical information and absence of causal descriptions. Researchers working with large databases should also be mindful of data structure design and inherent limitations to large databases, such as treatment bias and systemic sampling errors. Withstanding these limitations, several important studies have been published in vascular care using large databases. They represent timely, \"real-world\" analyses of questions that may be too difficult or costly to address using prospective randomized methods. Large databases will be an increasingly important analytical resource as we focus on improving national health care efficacy in the setting of limited resources.",

    "abstract": "The venous anatomy is highly variable. This is due to possible venous malformations (minor truncular forms) occurring during the late development of the embryo that produce several anatomical variations in the number and caliber of the main venous femoral trunks at the thigh level. Our aim was to study the prevalence of the different anatomical variations of the femoral vein at the thigh level.\nThis study used 336 limbs of 118 fresh, nonembalmed cadavers. The technique included washing of the whole venous system, latex injection, anatomical dissection, and then painting of the veins.\nThe modal anatomy of the femoral vein was found in 308 of 336 limbs (88%). Truncular malformations were found in 28 of 336 limbs (12%); unitruncular configurations in 3% (axo femoral trunk [1%] and deep femoral trunk [2%]). Bitruncular configurations were found in 9% (bifidity of the femoral vein [2%], femoral vein with axio-femoral trunk [5%], and femoral vein with deep femoral trunk [2%]).\nTruncular venous malformations of the femoral vein are not rare (12%). Their knowledge is important for the investigation of the venous network, particularly the venous mapping of patients with cardiovascular disease. It is also important to recognize a bitruncular configuration to avoid potential errors for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the femoral vein, in the case of an occluded duplicated trunk.",

    "abstract": "To establish associations between leg strength and mortality in men and women with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nThis was an observational, prospective study of 410 men and women with PAD aged 55 and older recruited from Chicago-area medical centers and followed for a mean of 60 months. The participants were followed for a mean of 60.0 months. Isometric knee extension, knee flexion, hip extension, and hip flexion were measured at baseline. Primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess relations between leg strength and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality among men and women, adjusting for age, race, comorbidities, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, and the ankle brachial index.\nAmong the 246 male participants, poorer baseline strength for knee flexion (P trend = .029), knee extension (P trend =.010), and hip extension (P trend = .013) were each associated independently with higher all-cause mortality. Poorer strength for knee flexion (P trend = .042) and hip extension (P trend = .029) were associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Compared with those in the fourth (best) baseline knee flexion quartile, hazard ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality among men in the first (poorest) knee flexion quartile were 2.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-4.87; P = .045) and 4.20 (95% CI, 1.12-15.79; P = .044), respectively. No significant associations of leg strength and all-cause mortality were identified among women.\nPoorer leg strength is associated with increased mortality in men, but not women, with PAD. Future study is needed to determine whether interventions that increase leg strength improve survival in men with PAD.",

    "abstract": "Many medical procedures undergo rapid evolution and process of care improvements after introduction. National outcome standards are useful to help physicians, institutions, and other stakeholders evaluate the quality of their programs and take action when suboptimal outcomes are identified. The purpose of this analysis was to derive contemporary risk-adjusted stroke rates from a large, contemporary, independently assessed outcome database within 30 days after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in the United States.\nThe second phase of carotid ACCULINK/ACCUNET post approval trial to uncover rare events (CAPTURE 2) is an ongoing prospective, multicenter, clinical trial conducted to assess CAS outcomes in the general practice setting after device approval for high surgical risk patients (symptomatic with >50% stenosis or asymptomatic with >80% stenosis). A neurologist examined the patients before the procedure, at 1 day and 30 days after CAS. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, any stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) within the periprocedural period. Strokes and neurologic events suspected to be strokes were adjudicated by an independent clinical events adjudication committee. Logistic regression analysis including stepwise logistic and multivariable modeling was performed to determine clinical predictors of periprocedural stroke outcome and generate a parsimonious model that could be used for a clinical standard.\nFive thousand two hundred ninety-seven consecutive patients (5297) had CAS performed by 459 physicians at 186 sites before the data cutoff of January 10, 2009. The 30-day rate of stroke was 2.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.2). Multivariable predictors of periprocedural stroke included age, symptomatic status, and dwell time of embolic protection device. A parsimonious model P(i) = 1/(1+e (-(-3.83 + 0.51 x (symptomatic) + 0.31 x (age >or=80) + 0.62 x (age >or=80 x symptomatic))), including symptomatic and octogenarian status and the term of the interaction of the two, was established based on consideration of clinical predictors, clinical interaction, and practicability.\nCAS outcomes in patients at high surgical risk have comparable periprocedural outcomes to published randomized trials of endarterectomy for patients at standard surgical risk. A model is presented for calculating a contemporary national standard for risk-adjusted stroke rates. Quality improvement measures could be based on relative performance to this benchmark and could improve overall outcomes for patients undergoing CAS.",

    "abstract": "Gender disparities, particularly among young women with cardiovascular disease, are a growing cause for concern. Depression is a prevalent and prognostically important comorbidity in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but its prevalence has not been described as a function of gender and age. Therefore, we compared depressive symptoms at the time of PAD diagnosis and 6 months later by gender and age in PAD patients.\nThe study enrolled 444 newly diagnosed patients with PAD (32% women) from two Dutch vascular outpatient clinics. Patients' depressive symptoms were assessed with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and 6 months later (CES-D scores >or=4 indicate significant depressive symptoms). Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the relationship among four gender-age groups (women <65 and >or=65 years; men <65 and >or=65 years [reference category]) and baseline and 6-month follow-up depressive symptoms.\nInitially, 33% of women <65 years had significant depressive symptoms, and 6 months later, significant depressive symptoms had developed in 19% of the other younger women. These rates were much higher than other gender-age groups (range at baseline, 11%-16%; 6-month incidence, 6%-10%; P <or= .03). Adjusting for demographics and clinical factors, women <65 years experienced a fourfold greater odds of baseline (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-8.7) and follow-up depressive symptoms (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.0-8.4) compared with men >or=65 years, whereas other gender-age groups were not at risk. Additional adjustment for change in the ankle-brachial index did not explain the increased depression risk in younger women (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2-10.2).\nSignificant depressive symptoms are more common in younger women with PAD than in other gender-age groups, both at the time of diagnosis and 6 months later. To eradicate gender-based disparities in PAD, depression screening and monitoring in younger women may be an important direction for future research and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for chronic venous insufficiency and venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to compare venous flow parameters of the lower limbs assessed by duplex ultrasound scanning in obese and nonobese individuals according to body mass index (BMI).\nVenous hemodynamics were studied in a prospective cohort study in nonobese (BMI <25 kg/m(2)) and obese individuals (BMI >30 kg/m(2)). Diameter, flow volume, peak, mean, and minimum velocities were assessed.\nThe study examined 36 limbs in 23 nonobese individuals and 44 limbs in 22 obese individuals. The diameter of the femoral vein was significantly greater in obese (8.5 +/- 2.2 mm) vs nonobese (7.1 +/- 1.6 mm; P = .0009) limbs. Venous peak and minimum velocities differed between nonobese and obese individuals (14.8 +/- 7.2 vs 10.8 +/- 4.8 cm/s [P = .0071] and 4.0 +/- 3.6 vs 1.7 +/- 6.3 cm/s [P = .056]). Calculation of venous amplitude and shear stress showed significantly higher values in nonobese vs obese (18.8 +/- 9.4 vs 12.5 +/- 9.3 cm/s [P = .003] and 2.13 +/- 2.2 dyn/cm(2) vs 1.6 +/- 2.7 dyn/cm(2) [P = .03]). Spearman rank correlation revealed a significant inverse correlation between waist-to-hip ratios and waist circumference and venous peak velocity, mean velocity, velocities amplitude (peak velocity-minimum velocity), and shear stress.\nLower limb venous flow parameters differ significantly between healthy obese and nonobese individuals. These findings support the mechanical role of abdominal adipose tissue potentially leading to elevated risk for both venous thromboembolism and chronic venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Long-term clinical outcomes after femoropopliteal (FP) stenting with nitinol stents have not yet been clear. We investigated the mid-term efficacy of FP stenting with nitinol stents.\nThis study was a multicenter retrospective study. From April 2004 to December 2008, 511 consecutive patients (639 limbs; mean age 71 +/- 7 years; 71% male) who underwent successful FP stenting with nitinol stents for de novo lesions were retrospectively selected and analyzed in this multicenter study. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Restenosis was defined as >2.4 of peak systolic velocity ratio by duplex or >50% stenosis by angiogram. Primary patency was defined as treated vessels without restenosis and repeat revascularization. Secondary patency was defined as target vessels that become totally occluded and are reopened by repeat revascularization.\nSixty-one percent of the patients had diabetes, 76% were claudicant, and 20% were on hemodialysis. Mean lesion length was 151 +/- 75 mm. Mean follow-up period was 22 +/- 11 months. Primary patency was 79.8%, 66.7%, and 63.1%, and secondary patency was 90.4%, 87.3%, and 86.2% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. During the follow-up period, 53 patients (10%) died. Of them, cardiovascular death was 38% and stent fracture had occurred in 14%. On multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazard ratio, cilostazol administration (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52;P < .0001), stent fracture (HR, 1.6; P = .03), hemodialysis (HR, 1.7; P = .01), and Trans Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II class C/D (HR, 2.4; P < .0001) were the independent predictors of primary patency after successful FP stenting.\nClinical efficacy of nitinol stent implantation for FP disease was favorable for up to 5 years.",

    "abstract": "Atherogenesis represents an active inflammatory process with leucocytes playing a major role. An elevated white blood cell count has been shown to be predictive of death in coronary artery disease patients. The aim of this study was to examine the predictive ability of neutrophil count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio for predicting survival in patients with critical lower limb ischemia (CLI).\nAll patients admitted to a single vascular unit with CCLI were identified prospectively over a 2-year period starting from January 2005. Patient demographics, clinical history, comorbidity, and risk factors for peripheral vascular disease were documented. The white blood count and differential cell count at admission was recorded. Overall, patient mortality was studied as the primary outcome.\nOne hundred forty-nine patients were identified, with a median age of 72 years (Interquartile range [IQR], 65.7-81). A neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of >or=5.25 was taken as the cutoff, based upon the receiver-operating-characteristic.The median follow up was 8.7 months (IQR, 3.1-16). During the follow-up period, there have been 62 deaths (43.4%). An elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and a high troponin level (>0.1) were found to be the only two factors independently associated with shorter survival on multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nThis study suggests that an elevated NLR can identify a poor-risk subset of patients among those being treated for critical limb ischemia. This simple, inexpensive test may, therefore, add to risk stratification of these high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an important determinant in atherosclerosis development. Various markers of oxidative stress, such as oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), nitrosative stress, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation, have been implicated in the initiation and/or progression of atherosclerosis, but their association with plaque erosion and symptomatic carotid disease has not been fully defined. In addition, certain oxidative markers have been shown in various models to promote plaque remodeling through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation.\nTo perform a global investigation of various oxidative stress markers and assess for potential relationships with destabilization and symptomatic development in human carotid plaques.\nThirty-six patients undergoing endarterectomy were evaluated and compared with 20 control specimens obtained at the time of autopsy. Differences between stable and unstable plaques, symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and >or=90% and <90% stenosis were evaluated. Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), nitrotyrosine (NT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyls (PCs) levels were determined in atheromatic plaques homogenates by corresponding biochemical assays. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was also employed to determine the percentage and topological distribution of cells expressing NT and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in serial sections from corresponding atheromatic plaques. MMP-9 expression was further verified using Western blot analysis.\nOx-LDL was increased in symptomatic patients (P < .05). Also, ox-LDL and NT levels were significantly higher in unstable versus stable carotid plaques (P < .05, respectively). Furthermore, IHC serial section analysis, corroborated by statistical analysis, showed a topological and expressional correlation between NT and MMP-9 (P < .05). MDA and PCs levels, although increased in carotid plaques, did not distinguish stable from unstable carotid plaques as well as symptomatic from asymptomatic patients with various degrees of stenosis.\nAll types of investigated oxidative stress markers were significantly increased in human carotid plaques, but only ox-LDL levels were associated with clinical symptoms, while peroxynitrite products and MMP-9 were specifically related to plaque instability.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic alterations of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) appear critical to the development of primary varicose veins. Previous study indicated desmuslin, an intermediate filament protein, was differentially expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from varicose veins; thus, it was naturally hypothesized that altered desmuslin expression might in turn affect the functioning of VSMCs, leading to the phenotypic alterations and varicose vein development.\nIn this study, expression of desmuslin in normal human saphenous vein SMCs was knocked down using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and control cells were treated with a scrambled siRNA sequence. The levels of several phenotypic markers including smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) were assessed. Collagen formation, matrix metalloproteinase expression (MMP-2), and cytoskeletal and morphological changes were also examined.\nSMCs treated with desmuslin siRNA exhibited significantly increased levels of collagen synthesis and MMP-2 expression and decreased expression levels of SM alpha-actin, SM-MHC, and smoothelin and exhibited disassembly of actin stress fibers when compared with the control cells. Changes in cell morphology and actin fiber networks in VSMCs treated with desmuslin siRNA were consistent with a lower degree of differentiation.\nThese results indicated desmuslin expression is required for the maintenance of VSMC phenotype. Decreased desmuslin expression may affect differentiation of VSMCs and ultimately contribute to the development of varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "Haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism is associated with the prevalence and clinical evolution of many inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis. Circulating neutrophils and neutrophil-associated proteases are an important initial component of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. Elastase and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are elevated in patients with AAAs. This study assessed the relationship between AAA expansion and Hp phenotypes, neutrophil count, elastase, and CRP levels.\nEighty-three consecutive AAA patients underwent annual ultrasound scans. Three major Hp phenotypes (1-1, 2-1, and 2-2) were determined, and the neutrophil count, serum elastase, and high-sensitivity (hs) CRP levels were measured at the initial examination. After initial screening, patients were rescanned at 6- to 12-month intervals up to a period of 2 to 7 years. The mean yearly growth of the AAA largest transverse diameter was estimated for each group of Hp patients. The results are presented as median (interquartile range).\nHp 2-1 patients had a significantly higher growth rate (3.69 [2.40] mm/y) of AAA compared with patients with Hp 2-2 (1.24 [0.79], P < .00001) and Hp 1-1 (1.45 [0.68], P = .00004). This association remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Elevated elastase serum activity was also evident in AAA patients with Hp 2-1 (0.119 [0.084] arbitrary units) in contrast to Hp 2-2 (0.064 [0.041], P < .00001) and Hp 1-1 (0.071 [0.040], P = .0006) patients. CRP serum levels (mg/L) were significantly higher in patients with Hp 2-1 (7.2 [7.1]) than in Hp 2-2 (3.4 [3.1], P = .0058) and Hp 1-1 (2.8 [4.1], P = .044). The neutrophil count was not significantly different among Hp groups.\nThe Hp 2-1 phenotype showed a strong association with increased rates of the expansion of AAAs and may be a useful independent predictor of growth rate. Further large follow-up studies will be needed to investigate the pathomechanisms of association and the role of elastase and inflammation in the progression of AAA.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the predictive value of histologic plaque characteristics for the occurrence of restenosis after femoral artery endarterectomy.\nIt would be advantageous if patients at increased risk for restenosis after arterial endarterectomy could be identified by histologic characteristics of the dissected plaque. Differences in atherosclerotic plaque composition of the carotid artery have been associated with restenosis rates after surgical endarterectomy. However, whether atherosclerotic plaque characteristics are also predictive for restenosis in other vascular territories is unknown.\nAtherosclerotic plaques of 217 patients who underwent a common femoral artery endarterectomy (CFAE; n = 124) or remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE; n = 93) were examined and scored microscopically for the presence of collagen, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, lipid core, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcifications. The 12-month restenosis rate was assessed using duplex ultrasound imaging (peak systolic velocity [PSV] ratio >or=2.5).\nThe 1-year restenosis rate was 66% (61 of 93) after RSFAE compared to 21% (26 of 124) after CFAE. Plaque with characteristics of high collagen and smooth muscle cell content were positively associated with the occurrence of restenosis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-4.68) and 2.20 (1.50-3.20) for superficial femoral artery (SFA) and common femoral artery (CFA), respectively. SFA plaques showed significantly heavier staining for collagen (69% vs 31% for CFA; P < .001) and smooth muscle cells (64% vs 36% for CFA; P < .001). After multivariate analysis, the operation type (CFAE or RSFAE), gender, and the presence of collagen were independent predictive variables for restenosis after endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA.\nPlaque composition of the CFA and SFA differs. Furthermore, the dissection of a fibrous collagen-rich plaque is an independent predictive variable for restenosis after endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA.",

    "abstract": "The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a widely used model for predicting cardiac events after noncardiac surgery. We compared the accuracy of the RCRI with a new, vascular surgery-specific model developed from patients within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE).\nWe studied 10,081 patients who underwent nonemergent carotid endarterectomy (CEA; n = 5293), lower extremity bypass (LEB; n = 2673), endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR; n = 1005), and open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (OAAA; n = 1,110) within the VSGNE from 2003 to 2008. First, we analyzed the ability of the RCRI to predict in-hospital major adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure (CHF) in the VSGNE cohort. Second, we used a derivation cohort of 8208 to develop a new cardiac risk prediction model specifically for vascular surgery patients. Chi-square analysis identified univariate predictors, and multivariate logistic regression was used to develop an aggregate and four procedure-specific risk prediction models for cardiac complications. Calibration and model discrimination were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The ability of the model to predict cardiac complications was assessed within a validation cohort of 1873. Significant predictors were converted to an integer score to create a practical cardiac risk prediction formula.\nThe overall incidence of major cardiac events in the VSGNE cohort was 6.3% (2.5% MI, 3.9% arrhythmia, 1.8% CHF). The RCRI predicted risk after CEA reasonably well but substantially underestimated risk after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA for low- and higher-risk patients. Across all VSGNE patients, the RCRI underestimated cardiac complications by 1.7- to 7.4-fold based on actual event rates of 2.6%, 6.7%, 11.6%, and 18.4% for patients with 0, 1, 2, and >or=3 risk factors. In multivariate analysis of the VSGNE cohort, independent predictors of adverse cardiac events were (odds ratio [OR]) increasing age (1.7-2.8), smoking (1.3), insulin-dependent diabetes (1.4), coronary artery disease (1.4), CHF (1.9), abnormal cardiac stress test (1.2), long-term beta-blocker therapy (1.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.6), and creatinine >or=1.8 mg/dL (1.7). Prior cardiac revascularization was protective (OR, 0.8). Our aggregate model was well calibrated (r = 0.99, P < .001), demonstrating moderate discriminative ability (ROC curve = 0.71), which differed only slightly from the procedure-specific models (ROC curves: CEA, 0.74; LEB, 0.72; EVAR, 0.74; OAAA, 0.68). Rates of cardiac complications for patients with 0 to 3, 4, 5, and >or=6 VSG risk factors were 3.1%, 5.0%, 6.8%, and 11.6% in the derivation cohort and 3.8%, 5.2%, 8.1%, and 10.1% in the validation cohort. The VSGNE cardiac risk model more accurately predicted the actual risk of cardiac complications across the four procedures for low- and higher-risk patients than the RCRI. When the VSG Cardiac Risk Index (VSG-CRI) was used to score patients, six categories of risk ranging from 2.6% to 14.3% (score of 0-3 to 8) were discernible.\nThe RCRI substantially underestimates in-hospital cardiac events in patients undergoing elective or urgent vascular surgery, especially after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA. The VSG-CRI more accurately predicts in-hospital cardiac events after vascular surgery and represents an important tool for clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and a history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases that risk. This study determined the incidence and risk factors for symptomatic perioperative VTE in patients with a prior diagnosis of DVT.\nAll lower extremity DVTs, diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2006, were identified through a vascular database. Patients who had subsequent surgery were reviewed. The following data were evaluated: location of DVT, time interval between DVT and surgery, type of surgery, common clinical VTE risk factors, postoperative venous duplex scans, computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, and ventilation-perfusion scans.\nA total of 372 patients with prior DVT underwent 1081 subsequent surgical procedures. One hundred nine patients undergoing 211 procedures had a follow-up venous duplex scan within 30 days after surgery. Of them, 46% received an inferior vena caval (IVC) filter, and pulmonary emboli were diagnosed in 3 patients (<1%). Overall, 24% of the patients developed DVT extension or new-site DVT in the perioperative period. The median time interval between the original DVT and surgery was 1.5 weeks in patients with DVT recurrence and 4 weeks in patients without recurrence (P = .22, Mann-Whitney). High-risk surgeries were associated with a >three-fold increased risk for recurrence, when compared with low-risk procedures (34% vs 11%; P = .009, chi(2)). Perioperative VTE recurrence was not influenced by the location of the original thrombus or other VTE risk factors.\nIn patients with prior DVT, perioperative symptomatic recurrence is common and is associated with high-risk procedures. A longer time interval between a DVT episode and subsequent surgery may decrease the risk of recurrence, but large clinical trials are needed to confirm this. Further prospective evaluations are needed to identify and treat patients at greatest risk for recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Juxtarenal aortic aneurysms (JAA) account for approximately 15% of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Despite advances in endovascular aneurysm repair, open repair requiring suprarenal aortic cross-clamping is still the treatment of choice for JAA. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine perioperative mortality and postoperative renal dysfunction after open repair for non-ruptured JAA.\nThe Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all studies reporting non-ruptured JAA repair published between January 1966 and December 2008. Two independent observers selected studies for inclusion, assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies, and performed the data extraction. Study heterogeneity was assessed using forest plots and by calculating the between-study variance. Outcomes were perioperative mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction, and new onset of dialysis. Summary estimates with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated using a random effects model based on the binomial distribution.\nTwenty-one non-randomized cohort studies from 1986 to 2008, reporting on 1256 patients, were included. Heterogeneity between the studies was low. The mean perioperative mortality was 2.9% (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.6). The mean incidence of new onset of dialysis was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.5). Incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction could be derived from 13 studies and ranged from 0% to 39% (median, 18%). In seven studies, cold renal perfusion during suprarenal clamping was performed in order to preserve renal function; however, based upon the included data, definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy could not be drawn.\nOpen repair of non-ruptured JAA using suprarenal cross-clamping can be performed with acceptable perioperative mortality; however, postoperative deterioration of renal function is a common complication. Preservation of renal function after JAA repair requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "To synthesize the available evidence regarding the outcomes associated with nonoperative management, open repair, and endovascular repair of thoracic aortic transection.\nWe searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus) for studies that enrolled patients with aortic transection and measured the outcomes of interest. Two reviewers determined study eligibility and extracted data. We estimated the event rate associated with the different approaches from case series and the relative risk from comparative studies. Estimates from each study were pooled using the random effects model.\nWe found 139 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were noncomparative surgical case series, retrospective, and none were randomized. Studies included 7768 patients, the majority of which were males. The mortality rate was significantly lower in patients who underwent endovascular repair, followed by open repair and nonoperative management (9%, 19%, and 46%, respectively, P < .01). No significant difference in event rate across the three groups was noted for the outcomes of anterior stroke, posterior stroke, or any stroke. The risk of spinal cord ischemia and end-stage renal disease were higher in open repair compared with the other 2 groups (9% vs 3% and 3%, P = .01 for spinal cord ischemia and 8% vs 5% and 3%, P = .01 for end-stage renal disease). Compared with endovascular repair, open repair was associated with an increased risk of graft infection and systemic infections. Meta-analyses of comparative studies demonstrated that compared with open repair, endovascular repair is associated with reduced mortality and spinal cord ischemia (relative risk, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.80; and relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.74; respectively). Inferences are limited by methodological quality, survival, and publication biases.\nVery low-quality evidence suggests that, compared with open repair or nonoperative management, endovascular repair of thoracic aortic transection is associated with better survival and decreased risk of spinal cord ischemia, renal injury, and graft and systemic infections. Nonoperative management is associated with the least favorable outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, aortobifemoral bypass has been the intervention of choice for iliac artery chronic total occlusions (CTOs). However, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, limiting its use in high-risk patients. To reduce procedural risk, subintimal angioplasty (SIA) for femoropopliteal CTO has been utilized by many, but few have extended this endovascular technique to treating iliac artery CTOs. We present our experience with 101 successful SIAs for iliac artery CTOs.\nA retrospective review of consecutive patients with iliac artery CTOs treated with subintimal angioplasty from June 2000 to January 2009 was completed. Demographic and risk factor data were obtained, along with procedural data. Primary and secondary patency, survival, freedom from claudication, and limb salvage rates were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were completed to identify factors adversely affecting primary patency.\nOne hundred twenty patients underwent an attempted SIA of an iliac artery CTO, and 101 iliac artery CTOs were successfully treated, giving a technical success rate of 84%. Technical failure was due to the inability to re-enter the lumen in all cases. Indications for intervention were lifestyle-altering claudication in 64 patients (63%) and critical limb ischemia (CLI), in 37 (37%). Eighty-five patients underwent percutaneous SIA, while 11 patients underwent a combined SIA with surgical outflow procedure. Lesions were classified as TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) B, 39 (39%); TASC C, 27 (27%); and TASC D, 35 (35%). In 82 (81%) lesions, stents were deployed with an average of 1.2 (range, 0-3) stents utilized. A re-entry device was used in 14 (14%) lesions. Major complication rate was 3.0%, with a 30-day mortality rate of 1.0%. Primary and secondary patency rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 86% and 94%, 76% and 92%, and 68% and 80%, respectively. Survival rate was 67% at 5 years, reflecting the poor health of this cohort. Limb salvage for CLI patients at 1 and 5 years was 97% and 95%, respectively. Freedom from claudication at 1 and 3 years was 89% and 73%. Univariate analysis identified hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and prior surgical bypass in treated limb as factors for loss of primary patency; however, on multivariate analysis, no factors remained statistically significant.\nThis study demonstrates that SIA of iliac CTOs is feasible and can be performed safely and effectively, even in high-risk patients. Excellent patency and limb salvage rates can be achieved. In our experience, the safety and durability of SIA makes it an attractive first-line therapy for iliac artery occlusive disease.",

Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, comorbidities, operative results, perioperative complications, length of stay, and late outcomes were analyzed.\nSixty-five patients were identified (men, n = 27) with a median age of 82 years (80-89 years old). Mean aneurysm size was 6.7 cm. Morphology consisted of type IV thoracoabdominal (n = 19), suprarenal (n = 14), pararenal (n = 19), and infrarenal (n = 13). Eighty-five percent of cases were performed electively. A tube graft was used in 58 patients, and the left renal artery was bypassed in 33 patients. Fifty-two patients required a suprarenal or supraceliac clamp, with a mean proximal clamp time of 22 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 1800 mL. Mortality was 6% at 30 days. Overall morbidity was 42%, most commonly an arrhythmia (25%). Major complication rate was 18%. Median intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay was 3 and 9 days, respectively. Sixty-one percent of patients were discharged directly home. Six patients developed acute renal failure, although none progressed to dialysis. Mean serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL preoperatively and 1.5 mg/dL at discharge. One patient developed bowel necrosis (sigmoid colon) requiring resection. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 81 months (mean, 24 months). Three-year survival was 79%.\nWith an increasing population of elderly patients, vascular surgeons are continually confronted with patients over 80 years of age. Our patients consisted of those not anatomically suitable for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Despite a predominance of proximal aneurysms, our results demonstrate excellent rates of morbidity and mortality. Thus, open AAA repair can be done safely and effectively in octogenarians, and age alone should not exclude this form of repair.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent atherosclerotic syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PAD is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis obliterans (ASO) and thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), and can lead to claudication and critical limb ischemia (CLI), often resulting in a need for major amputation and subsequent death. Standard treatment for such severe cases of PAD is surgical or endovascular revascularization. However, up to 30% of patients are not candidates for such interventions, due to high operative risk or unfavorable vascular involvement. Therefore, new strategies are needed to offer these patients a viable therapeutic option. Bone-marrow derived stem and progenitor cells have been identified as a potential new therapeutic option to induce angiogenesis. These findings prompted clinical researchers to explore the feasibility of cell therapies in patients with peripheral and coronary artery disease in several small trials. Clinical benefits were reported from these trials including improvement of ankle-brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (TcO(2)), reduction of pain, and decreased need for amputation. Nonetheless, large randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are necessary and currently ongoing to provide stronger safety and efficacy data on cell therapy. Current literature is supportive of intramuscular bone marrow cell administration as a relatively safe, feasible, and possibly effective therapy for patients with PAD who are not subjects for conventional revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Leg swelling in menopausal women is well known. Prevailing concept in primary care is that it is polycentric and a treatable cause may not be found. Patients are placed on empiric diuretics often without benefit. Our clinical experience indicates that iliac venous vein obstruction is the core cause; a variety of secondary factors common in postmenopausal women precipitate symptoms.\nA total of 163 limbs in 150 postmenopausal women (\u2265 55 years of age) with leg swelling unresponsive to conservative therapy underwent intravascular ultrasound-guided iliac vein stenting over an 11-year period. Preoperative investigations included duplex, airplethysmography, venous pressure tests, contrast studies, and lymphangiography. The postmenopausal group constituted 9% of all limbs (n = 1760) stented for chronic venous disease (CVD) during the same period and 18% of those stented for swelling (n = 922). Median age was 67 (range, 55-92) and left-to-right ratio 2:1.\nIliac vein obstruction was \"primary\" (nonthrombotic) in 65% and postthrombotic in 35% of limbs; 35% of limbs had obstruction only and 65% combined obstruction/reflux. Lymphatic dysfunction was present in 21% of the limbs. Mean intravascular ultrasound area stenosis was 68% \u00b1 22 SD. Mean follow-up was 22 months (\u00b1 26 SD) (range, 1-113 months). Secondary stent patency (6 years) was 100% in primary and 91% in postthrombotic limbs; overall 98%. Swelling improved significantly (P < .0001) from preoperative grade 2.5 (\u00b1 0.8 SD) to postoperative grade 1.2 (1.2 SD). Associated pain also improved significantly (P < .0001) from preoperative visual analog scale 3.5 (\u00b1 3 SD) to postoperative 0.9 (2.1 \u00b1 SD). Quality-of-life (CIVQ) scores improved significantly in every category and overall (P < .0001).\nPatients with postmenopausal leg swelling often have obstructive venous pathology even though suggestive venous history and other signs are often absent. Morbidity arises from painful swelling that affects mobility, quality of life, and ability of self-care at later stages of life. Outpatient percutaneous iliac vein stenting affords substantial symptom relief and improvement in quality-of-life measures. Recognition of the clinical complex as a distinct entity of venous origin may lead to greater awareness and effective treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dense angiogenic sprouting occurs from arteriovenous loops (AVLs) incorporating autologous vein grafts inserted into empty plastic chambers in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine if angiogenesis from the AVL was limited by substituting an \"off the shelf\" cold-stored allograft vein instead of an autologous vein.\nFour Sprague Dawley rat groups (two AVL configurations \u00d7 two chamber types) were established for both 2-week and 6-week harvest. Control AVLs were autologous femoral vein grafts harvested from the left femoral vein that were surgically inserted between the cut femoral artery and vein on the right side. Experimental \"allograft\" AVLs were rat femoral veins cold-stored (4\u00b0C, sterile) for 4 to 7 weeks and then microsurgically interposed between the right femoral artery and vein of an unrelated rat. The two AVL types were inserted in one of two plastic chamber types--smooth or perforated. At harvest, the AVL constructs were checked for patency, weighed, their volume determined, and histology undertaken.

    "abstract": "Late survival is similar after open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR), despite a perioperative benefit with EVAR. AAA-related reinterventions are more common after EVAR, whereas laparotomy-related reinterventions are more common after open repair. The effect of reinterventions on survival, however, is unknown. We therefore evaluated the rate of reinterventions and readmission after initial AAA repair, 30-day mortality, and the effect on long-term survival.\nWe identified AAA-related and laparotomy-related reinterventions for propensity score-matched cohorts of 45,652 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR and open repair from 2001 to 2004. Follow-up was up to 6 years. Hospitalizations for ruptured AAA without repair and for bowel obstruction or ventral hernia without abdominal surgery were also recorded. Event rates were calculated per year and are presented through 6 years of follow-up as events per 100 person-years. Thirty-day mortality was calculated for each reintervention or readmission.\nThrough 6 years, overall reinterventions or readmissions were similar between repair methods but slightly more common after EVAR (7.6 vs 7.0/100 person-years; relative risk [RR], 1.1; P < .001). Overall 30-day mortality with any reintervention or readmission was 9.1%. EVAR patients had more ruptures (0.50 vs 0.09 [RR, 5.7; P < .001]), with a mortality of 28%, but these were uncommon. EVAR patients also had more AAA-related reinterventions through 6 years (3.7 vs 0.9 [RR, 4.0; P < .001]; mortality, 5.6%), most of which were minor endovascular reinterventions (2.4 vs 0.2 [RR, 11.4; P < .001]), with a 30-day mortality of 3.0%. However, minor open (0.8 vs 0.5 [RR, 1.4; P < .001]; mortality, 6.9%) and major reinterventions (0.4 vs 0.2 [RR, 2.4; P < .001]; mortality, 12.1%) were also more common after EVAR than open repair. Conversely, EVAR patients had fewer laparotomy-related reinterventions than open patients (1.4 vs 3.0 [RR, 0.5; P < .001]; mortality, 8.1%) and readmissions without surgery (2.0 vs 2.7 [RR, 0.7; P < .001]; mortality 10.9%). Overall, reinterventions or readmission accounted for 9.6% of all EVAR deaths and 7.6% of all open repair deaths in the follow-up period (P < .001).\nReintervention and readmission are slightly higher after EVAR. Survival is negatively affected by reintervention or readmission after EVAR and open surgery, which likely contributes to the erosion of the survival benefit of EVAR over time.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS) has benefit for intraoperative and subsequent evaluation of surgical bypasses in the lower extremities. The utility of DUS after endovascular revascularizations is not established. This study was performed to evaluate whether DUS findings after infrainguinal endovascular interventions for critical limb ischemia (CLI) were predictive of need for reintervention or amputation.\nTo identify the study cohort, peripheral interventions for CLI (Rutherford grades 4, 5, 6) over a 24-month period (2006-2007) were reviewed. DUS findings were considered indicative of hemodynamic stenosis if the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was \u2265 180 cm/s or the PSV velocity ratio was \u2265 2.0. Demographic, clinical, procedural, and outcomes were examined. SVS and TASC II classifications and reporting standards were used. Arteriograms were reviewed and treated segments were categorized as patent (<30% residual stenosis) or abnormal (\u2265 30% residual stenosis).\nThere were 122 infrainguinal interventions for CLI in 113 patients (53% male; mean age 71 years). Risk factors included diabetes: 61%; renal failure: 20%; and smoking (within 1 year): 40%. DUS was performed within 30 days of the index procedure in 90 cases. Fifty patients had an abnormal early duplex and 40 patients had a normal duplex. In patients with a normal duplex ultrasound the amputation rate was 5% vs 20% in the group with an abnormal duplex (P = .04). Primary patency was 56% in the normal duplex group and 46% in the abnormal duplex group (P = .18). Early duplex ultrasound was able to identify a residual stenosis not seen on completion angiography in 56% of cases.\nDuplex scanning detects residual stenosis missed with conventional angiography after infrainguinal interventions. An abnormal DUS in the first 30 days after an intervention is associated with an increased risk of amputation. This suggests a possible role for intraprocedural DUS, as well as routine postprocedure DUS, close clinical follow-up, and consideration of reintervention for residual abnormalities in patients treated for CLI.",

    "abstract": "The Society for Vascular Surgery\u00ae pursued development of clinical practice guidelines for the management of traumatic thoracic aortic injuries with thoracic endovascular aortic repair. In formulating clinical practice guidelines, the Society selected a panel of experts and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. They used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods (GRADE) to develop and present their recommendations. The systematic review included 7768 patients from 139 studies. The mortality rate was significantly lower in patients who underwent endovascular repair, followed by open repair, and nonoperative management (9%, 19%, and 46%, respectively, P < .01). Based on the overall very low quality of evidence, the committee suggests that endovascular repair of thoracic aortic transection is associated with better survival and decreased risk of spinal cord ischemia, renal injury, graft, and systemic infections compared with open repair or nonoperative management (Grade 2, Level C). The committee was also surveyed on a variety of issues that were not specifically addressed by the meta-analysis. On these select matters, the majority opinions of the committee suggest urgent repair following stabilization of other injuries, observation of minimal aortic defects, selective (vs routine) revascularization in cases of left subclavian artery coverage, and that spinal drainage is not routinely required in these cases.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in revascularization following extremity vascular injury, the relationship between time to restoration of flow and functional limb salvage is unknown. The objectives of this study are to describe a large animal survival model of hind limb ischemia/reperfusion and define neuromuscular recovery following increasing ischemic periods.\nSus scrofa swine (N = 38; weight, 87 \u00b1 6.2 kg) were randomized to iliac artery occlusion for 0 (Control), 1 (1HR), 3 (3HR), or 6 (6HR) hours, followed by vessel repair and 14 days of recovery. Additionally, one group underwent iliac artery division with no restoration of flow (Ligation), and one group underwent iliac artery exposure only without intervention (Sham). A composite physiologic measure of recovery (PMR) was generated to assess group differences over 14 days of survival. PMR included limb function (Tarlov score) and electrophysiologic measures (compound muscle action potential amplitude, sensory nerve action potential amplitude, and nerve conduction velocity). Using the PMR and extrapolating the point at which recovery following ligation crosses the slope connecting recovery after 3 and 6 hours of ischemia, an estimate of the ischemic threshold for the hind limb is made. These results were correlated with peroneus muscle and peroneal nerve histology.\nBaseline physiologic characteristics were similar between groups. Neuromuscular recovery in groups with early restoration of flow (Control, 1HR, 3HR) was similar and nearly complete (92%, 98%, and 88%, respectively; P > .45). While recovery was diminished in both 6HR and Ligation, Ligation, rather than repair, exhibited greater recovery (68% vs 53%; P < .05).

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, a polyvascular process associated with reduced survival. In nonvascular surgery populations, a paradox between body mass index (BMI) and survival is described. This paradox includes reduced survival in underweight patients, whereas overweight and obese patients have a survival benefit. No clear explanation for this paradox has been given. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of the obesity paradox in vascular surgery patients and the influence of polyvascular disease on the obesity paradox.\nIn this retrospective study, 2933 consecutive patients were classified according to their preoperative BMI (kg/m(2)) and screened for polyvascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors before surgery. In addition, medication use at the time of discharge was noted. Outcome was all-cause mortality during a median follow-up of 6.0 years (interquartile range, 2-9 years).\nBMI (kg/m(2)) groups included 68 (2.3%) underweight (BMI <18.5), 1379 (47.0%) normal (BMI 18.5-24.9, reference), 1175 (40.0%) overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and 311 (10.7%) obese (BMI \u2265 30) patients. No direct interaction between BMI, polyvascular disease, and long-term outcome was observed. Underweight was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.22). In contrast, overweight protected for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.700-0.89). Cardioprotective medication usage in underweight patients was the lowest (P < .001), although treatment targets for risk factors were equally achieved within all treated groups.\nOverweight patients referred for vascular surgery were characterized by an increased incidence of polyvascular disease and required more extensive medical treatment for cardiovascular risk factors at discharge. Long-term follow-up showed a paradox of reduced mortality in overweight patients.",

    "abstract": "Aortic injury is the second leading cause of death in trauma. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has recently been applied to traumatic thoracic aortic injuries (TTAIs) as a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery. We sought to determine the impact of TEVAR on national trends in the management of TTAI.\nWe queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the years 2001 to 2007 to select patients diagnosed with TTAI (International Classification of Disease-9 code 901.0). Patients were evaluated based on open surgical repair, TEVAR, or nonoperative management, before and after widespread adoption of TEVAR (2001-2005 and 2006-2007). Outcomes of interest were inpatient mortality, length of stay (LOS), and major complications.\nAn estimated 1180 annual admissions occurred for TTAI in the United States. Comparing the two time periods, there was an increase in TEVAR (P < .001) with a simultaneous decrease in open repair (P < .001) in 2006 to 2007. The overall number of interventions also increased (P < .001). Overall mortality decreased (25.0% vs 19.0%;P < .001), corresponding to improved survival in the nonoperative group (28.0% vs 23.2%; P < .001). There was no improvement in open repair mortality rates between the two time periods. Comparing intervention types, the TEVAR group had a higher percentage of patients with brain injury (26.1% vs 20.6%; P = .008), lung injury (25.0% vs 17.7%; P < .001), and hemothorax (32.5% vs 21.7%; P < .001) than the open surgery group. There were no differences in the number of intra-abdominal injuries or major orthopedic fractures. The open surgery group had more respiratory complications (43.9% vs 54.2%; P < .001), whereas TEVAR had a higher stroke rate (1.9% vs 0.7%; P = .021). There were no differences in paraplegia or renal failure. Overall in-hospital mortality was 23.2% (nonoperative group 26.7%, open repair 12.4%, and TEVAR 10.6%). Mortality between open repair and TEVAR groups were not significantly different. LOS was shorter among the TEVAR group vs open (15.7 vs 22.9 days; P < .001).\nTEVAR has replaced open repair as the primary operative treatment for TTAI and has extended operative treatment to those patients not previously considered candidates for repair. Increased utilization of TEVAR is associated with improved overall mortality. There is no difference in mortality between TEVAR and open repair groups in our study, which likely reflects the multisystem nature of injury and greater preoperative risk in the TEVAR group.",

    "abstract": "Increasing data suggest that statins can significantly decrease cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events due to a plaque stabilization effect. However, the benefit of statins in patients undergoing carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) for carotid stenosis is not well defined. The aim of this study was to investigate whether statins use was associated with decreased perioperative and late risks of stroke, mortality, and restenosis in patients undergoing CAS.\nAll patients undergoing CAS for primary carotid stenosis from 2004 to 2009 were reviewed. The independent association of statins and perioperative morbidity was assessed using multivariable analysis. Survival curves and Cox regression models were used to assess late morbidity and restenosis. Propensity score adjustment was employed.\nA total of 1083 consecutive CAS were performed (29% females, mean age 71.5 years; 24.7% symptomatic); 465 (43%) were on statins medication before treatment that was not discontinued at discharge. Statins use was associated with a reduction of perioperative stroke and death (odds ratio [OR] 0.327, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.80, P = .016) according to multivariable analysis. Statins effect was more significant in reducing stroke and death in symptomatic patients (OR 0.13; P = .032) and in males (OR 0.27, P = .01). At 5 years, survival (87.2% vs 78.3%; P = .009) and ischemic stroke-free interval (88.9% vs 99.7%; P = .02) rates were higher in the statins group of patients. Adjusting for propensity score and covariates in Cox regression analyses, statins use was independently associated with reduced long-term mortality risk (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.97; P = .039) and borderline associated with decreased late ischemic stroke risk (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.018-1.08, P = .059). There was no effect on restenosis rates.\nThese data suggest that statins use is associated with decreased perioperative and late ischemic strokes risk and reduced mortality rates in patients undergoing CAS.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to report our experience of the repair of renal artery restenosis after percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) using a total laparoscopic technique without robotic assistance.\nBetween February 2005 and October 2009, we performed six total laparoscopic aortorenal artery bypasses for restenosis after failed PTRA. All these patients had recurrent hypertension with renal insufficiency.\nThe mean operative time was 246 minutes (range, 200-310 minutes). The mean warm renal ischemic time was 28 minutes (range, 22-35 minutes). All patients received a prosthetic graft interposition. The estimated surgical blood loss was 980 mL (range, 500-1400 mL). No conversion was observed and no in-hospital deaths occurred. There was no severe postoperative morbidity. Postoperative serum creatinine levels raised in all patients but all returned to baseline before discharge. Median length of postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4-8 days). Median follow-up was 13 months (range, 7-19 months). Color Doppler ultrasound scan examination and computed tomography (CT) with injection of contrast media showed patency of all bypasses. Hypertension was improved in all patients but renal insufficiency remained unchanged.\nTotal laparoscopic renal artery bypass is feasible and safe in patients after failed PTRA. This approach may reduce the morbidity of open repair but is technically demanding and necessitates a large previous experience in total laparoscopic aortic surgery.",

    "abstract": "The impact of vascular injuries on patient mortality has not been well evaluated in multi-trauma patients. This study seeks to determine (1) whether the presence of vascular trauma negatively affects outcome compared with nonvascular trauma (NVT) and (2) the utility of existing severity scoring systems in predicting mortality among vascular trauma (VT) patients.\nA retrospective review of our trauma database from January 2005 to December 2007 was conducted. Demographics, Injury Severity Scores (ISS), Revised Trauma Scores (RTS), Trauma Score-Injury Severity Scores (TRISS), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, and mortality rates were compared. Control patients were selected from a matching cohort based on ISS. Comparisons were made between groups based on the above scoring systems. Statistical analysis used \u03c7(2) analysis and Student t-tests.\nFifty VT and 50 NVT patients were identified with no significant differences in age, gender, mechanism of injury, ISS, RTS, or TRISS. The mean APACHE II score was higher in VT compared with NVT (12.3 vs 8.8, P < .05). Overall mortality was higher in VT compared with NVT but did not reach statistical significance (24% vs 11.8%, P = .108). VT patients with RTS score >5 had a higher mortality rate (26% vs 2.2%, P = .007). VT patients with an ISS score >24 had a higher mortality compared with NVT patients (61% vs 28.6%, P = .04). VT patients with an APACHE II score <14 also had a higher mortality rate (18.2% vs 0%, P = .007). Finally, VT patients with a TRISS probability of survival of >80% had a higher mortality rate (13.9% vs 0%, P = .05).\nIn multi-trauma patients, the presence of vascular injury was associated with increased mortality in less severely injured patients based on the RTS, TRISS, and APACHE II scores. These scoring systems underestimated mortality in patients with vascular trauma. Level of care and future trauma algorithms should be adjusted in the presence of vascular trauma.",

    "abstract": "Adoption of residents' working time restrictions potentially undermines surgical training by reduction of operating room exposure. Simulation has been proposed as a way to acquire necessary skills in a laboratory environment but remains difficult to incorporate into training schedules. This study assessed whether residents working successive nights could acquire endovascular skills similar to colleagues working day shifts.\nThis prospective observational cohort study recruited 20 junior residents, divided into day shift and night shift groups by their respective call schedule. After initial cognitive skills training, a validated renal artery stent module on an endovascular simulator was completed over a series of seven sequential shifts during 1 week. The primary outcome measure was serial technical skill assessments. Secondary measures comprised assessments of activity, cognitive performance, introspective fatigue, quality, and quantity of preceding sleep.\nBoth groups demonstrated significant learning curves for total time at the first session median vs seventh session median (181 vs 564 seconds [P < .001]; night, 1399 vs 572 [P < .001]), fluoroscopy time (day, 702 vs 308 seconds, [P < .001]; night, 669 vs 313 [P < .001]), and contrast volume (day, 29 vs 13 mL [P < .001]; night, 40 vs 16 [P < .001]). Residents working day shifts reached plateau 1 day earlier in the above measures vs those on night duty. The night shift group walked more steps (P < .001), reviewed more patients (P < .001), performed worse on all cognitive assessments (P < .05), slept less (P < .05), had poorer quality of sleep (P = .001), and was more fatigued (P < .001) than the day shift group. Acquired skill was retained a week after completion of shifts.\nTechnical skills training after night shift work enables acquisition of endovascular technical skills, although it takes longer than after day shift training. This study provides evidence for program directors to organize simulation-based training schedules for residents on night shift rotations.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians have relied on published institutional experience for interpreting carotid duplex ultrasound studies (CDUS). This study will validate the ultrasound imaging consensus criteria published in 2003.\nThe CDUS and angiography results of 376 carotid arteries were analyzed. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROCs) curves were used to compare peak systolic velocities (PSVs), end-diastolic velocities (EDVs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and ICA/common carotid (CCA) ratios in detecting < 50%, 50% to 69% (ICA PSV of 125-230 cm/s), and 70% to 99% (PSV of \u2265 230 cm/s) stenosis according to the consensus criteria.\nThe consensus criteria uses a PSV of 125 to 230 cm/s for detecting angiographic stenosis of 50% to 69%, which has a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 68%, and overall accuracy of 85%. A PSV of \u2265 230 cm/s for \u2265 70% stenosis had a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, and overall accuracy of 95%. ROC curves showed that the ICA PSV was significantly better (area under the curve [AUC], 0.97) than EDV (AUC, 0.94) or ICA/CCA ratio (AUC, 0.84; P = .036) in detecting \u2265 70% stenosis and \u2265 50% stenosis. Pearson correlations showed a statistical difference between the correlation of PSV with angiography (0.833; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-0.86), EDV with angiography (0.755; 95% CI, 0.71-0.80), and ICA/CCA systolic ratio with angiography (0.601; 95% CI, 0.53-0.66; P < .0001) in detecting 70% to 99% stenosis. Adding the EDV values or the ratios to the PSV values did not improve accuracy.

    "abstract": "Mortality rates following repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms have remained depressingly high over the last number of decades despite advances in anesthesia and perioperative care. Prior to the introduction of endovascular repair, refinements in surgical technique had been few and far between. It was not until fairly recently that we finally observed a reduction in mortality coinciding with the wider adoption of endovascular repair. So, the case is closed, right? Endovascular repair should be widely adopted in all suitable patients? Well, not exactly. The following debate centers around what level of evidence is required to answer this question. Frank Veith argues that we're already there. He was an early adopter and innovator of endovascular techniques and feels that we have enough information to widely adopt endovascular repair of ruptured aneurysms. Janet Powell and Robert Hinchliffe, innovators in their own right, feel that the generalizability and applicability of endovascular repair require further evaluation with a randomized trial. Both offer clear and reasoned arguments.",

    "abstract": "Blunt cerebrovascular injuries, defined as blunt injuries to the internal carotid or vertebral arteries, are uncommon and usually occur in victims of high-speed deceleration motor vehicle crashes. A blunt cerebrovascular injury after an equestrian accident is an extremely unusual presentation. In recent years, advances in screening and treatment with pharmacologic anticoagulation before the onset of neurologic symptoms have improved outcomes for these patients. Endovascular stenting and embolization, although unproven, offer a new potential approach for these complex injuries. We present a unique case of four-vessel blunt cerebrovascular injuries after a horse-riding injury that required multidisciplinary management.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis and inflammation are important features of atherosclerotic plaques. We investigated whether a common signal molecule can trigger these two apparently separate pathways. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1) is known to participate in atherosclerosis and to stimulate apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1), one of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, which is activated by various extracellular stimuli and involved in a variety of cellular function.\nWe tested carotid artery specimens from 50 subjects who underwent angioplasty and five age-matched controls for either Western blot or histologic analysis. The hypoxic status was investigated by means of HIF-1\u03b1 expression in carotid specimens.\nHIF-1\u03b1 was significantly upregulated in carotid specimens with respect to controls (P < .05), ASK-1 was detected in plaques of any composition from lipidic to calcific, and this expression increased with the stage of the plaque and with the expression of inflammatory (p-ERK, RANK-L, OPG) and apoptotic molecules (caspase 9, p-p-38, and p-JNK).\nOur data suggest that hypoxia is the key regulating factor that triggers inflammation as well as apoptosis in the human atherosclerotic plaque.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the mouse peritoneum can function like a bioreactor to generate directed bio-engineered tissues such as those used for bypass grafting. Additionally, we reasoned that the mouse animal model would allow us to elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the generation of tissue in peritoneal cavity.\nPlastic tubes (two tubes/mouse) were implanted into the peritoneal cavity of three strains of mice (C57BL/6, BALB/c, and MRL). The tubes were harvested, tissue capsule surrounding the tubes was removed, and analyzed by immunostaining (five capsules/five mice/strain) and microarray (three capsules/three mice/strain). In addition, the tissue capsules that were harvested from MRL mice (n = 21) were grafted into abdominal aorta of the same mice as autografts. The patency of all grafts was monitored by micro-ultrasound, and their functionality was assessed by laser Doppler imaging of blood flow in femoral arteries. Venous (n = 13) and arterial isografts (n = 11) were used as positive controls. In a negative control group (five mice/strain), the abdominal aorta was occluded by double ligation with 9-0 silk.\nThe implanted plastic tubes required at least 8 weeks of incubation in the peritoneum of the three strains of mice in order to generate useful grafts. No vascular cells were found in the tissue capsules. Microarray analysis of tissue capsules revealed that the capsular cells express a gene expression program that is vastly shared among the three strains of mice, and the cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity. The micro-ultrasound analysis of the grafts showed that 62% of autografts remained patent compared with 77% of venous isografts and 91% of arterial isografts. The laser Doppler imaging analysis showed that blood flow dropped by 40% and 35% in the autografts and vein isografts, respectively, 1 day after surgery. The flow, however, rebounded to the level of arterial isografts 1 month post-surgery and remained unchanged among all grafts for the next 4 months. Immunostaining of the autografts showed a thick vessel wall with endothelial cells that lined the lumen and smooth muscle cells that constituted the graft wall.\nThe mouse peritoneal cavity of mice has the ability to function like a bioreactor to generate bio-engineered tissues. The tissue capsules harvested from peritoneal cavity of a mouse are composed of nonvascular cells that display phenotype of progenitor cells. After grafting, however, the capsule autografts become arterialized and remained patent for at least 4 months after surgery, similar to venous or arterial isografts.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with reduced progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. Mechanisms responsible for this negative association remain unknown. We created AAAs in hyperglycemic mice to examine the influence of serum glucose concentration on experimental aneurysm progression.\nAortic aneurysms were induced in hyperglycemic (DM) and normoglycemic models by using intra-aortic porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) infusion in C57BL/6 mice or by systemic infusion of angiotensin II (ANG) in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice, respectively. In an additional DM cohort, insulin therapy was initiated after aneurysm induction. Aneurysmal aortic enlargement progression was monitored with serial transabdominal ultrasound measurements. At sacrifice, AAA cellularity and proteolytic activity were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and substrate zymography, respectively. Influences of serum glucose levels on macrophage migration were examined in separate models of thioglycollate-induced murine peritonitis.\nAt 14 days after PPE infusion, AAA enlargement in hyperglycemic mice (serum glucose \u2265 300 mg/dL) was less than that in euglycemic mice (PPE-DM: 54% \u00b1 19% vs PPE: 84% \u00b1 24%, P < .0001). PPE-DM mice also demonstrated reduced aortic mural macrophage infiltration (145 \u00b1 87 vs 253 \u00b1 119 cells/cross-sectional area, P = .0325), elastolysis (% residual elastin: 20% \u00b1 7% vs 12% \u00b1 6%, P = .0209), and neovascularization (12 \u00b1 8 vs 20 \u00b1 6 vessels/high powered field, P = .0229) compared with PPE mice. Hyperglycemia limited AAA enlargement after ANG infusion in ApoE(-/-) mice (ANG-DM: 38% \u00b1 12% vs ANG: 61% \u00b1 37% at day 28). Peritoneal macrophage production was reduced in response to thioglycollate stimulation in hyperglycemic mice, with limited augmentation noted in response to vascular endothelial growth factor administration. Insulin therapy reduced serum glucose levels and was associated with AAA enlargement rates intermediate between euglycemic and hyperglycemic mice (PPE: 1.21 \u00b1 0.14 mm vs PPE-DM: 1.00 \u00b1 0.04 mm vs PPE-DM + insulin: 1.14 \u00b1 0.05 mm).\nHyperglycemia reduces progression of experimental AAA disease; lowering of serum glucose levels with insulin treatment diminishes this protective effect. Identifying mechanisms of hyperglycemic aneurysm inhibition may accelerate development of novel clinical therapies for AAA disease.",

We sought to determine whether clopidogrel plus ASA conferred benefit on limb outcomes over ASA alone in patients undergoing below-knee bypass grafting.\nPatients undergoing unilateral, below-knee bypass graft for atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were enrolled 2 to 4 days after surgery and were randomly assigned to clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus ASA 75 to 100 mg/day or placebo plus ASA 75 to 100 mg/day for 6 to 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of index-graft occlusion or revascularization, above-ankle amputation of the affected limb, or death. The primary safety endpoint was severe bleeding (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue plasminogen activator for Occluded coronary arteries [GUSTO] classification).\nIn the overall population, the primary endpoint occurred in 149 of 425 patients in the clopidogrel group vs 151 of 426 patients in the placebo (plus ASA) group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.23). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, the primary endpoint was significantly reduced by clopidogrel in prosthetic graft patients (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.95; P = .025) but not in venous graft patients (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.94-1.67, not significant [NS]). A significant statistical interaction between treatment effect and graft type was observed (P(interaction) = .008). Although total bleeds were more frequent with clopidogrel, there was no significant difference between the rates of severe bleeding in the clopidogrel and placebo (plus ASA) groups (2.1% vs 1.2%).\nThe combination of clopidogrel plus ASA did not improve limb or systemic outcomes in the overall population of PAD patients requiring below-knee bypass grafting. Subgroup analysis suggests that clopidogrel plus ASA confers benefit in patients receiving prosthetic grafts without significantly increasing major bleeding risk.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) leads to systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure in clinical and laboratory settings. We investigated the lung structural, functional, and genomic response to mesenteric IRI with and without regional intraischemic hypothermia (RIH) in rodents and hypothesized that RIH would protect the lung and preferentially modulate the distant organ transcriptome under these conditions.\nSprague-Dawley rats underwent sham laparotomy or superior mesenteric artery occlusion (SMAO) for 60 minutes with or without RIH. Gut temperature was maintained at 15\u00b0-20\u00b0C during SMAO, and systemic normothermia (37\u00b0C) was maintained throughout the study period. At 6 or 24 hours, lung tissue was collected for (1) histology, (2) myeloperoxidase activity, (3) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentrations, (4) lung wet/dry ratios, and (5) total RNA isolation and hybridization to Illumina's Sentrix BeadChips (>22,000 probes) for gene expression profiling. Significantly affected genes (false discovery rate <5% and fold change \u22651.5) were linked to gene ontology (GO) terms using MAPPFinder, and hypothermia-suppressed genes were further analyzed with Pubmatrix.\nMesenteric IRI-induced lung injury, as evidenced by leukocyte trafficking, alveolar hemorrhage, and increased BAL protein and wet/dry ratios, and activated a proinflammatory lung transcriptome compared with sham. In contrast, rats treated with RIH exhibited lung histology, BAL protein, and wet/dry ratios similar to sham. At 6 hours, GO analysis identified 232 hypothermia-suppressed genes related to inflammation, innate immune response, and cell adhesion, and 33 hypothermia-activated genes related to lipid and amine metabolism and defense response. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validated select array changes in top hypothermia-suppressed genes lipocalin-2 (lcn-2) and chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1), prominent genes associated with neutrophil activation and trafficking.\nTherapeutic hypothermia during SMAO provides distant organ protection and preferentially modulates the IRI-activated transcriptome in the rat lung. This study identifies potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets of mesenteric IRI and provides a platform for further mechanistic study of hypothermic protection at the cellular and subcellular level.",

    "abstract": "The traditional apprenticeship model introduced by Halsted of \"learning by doing\" may just not be valid in the modern practice of vascular surgery. The model is often criticized for being somewhat unstructured because a resident's experience is based on what comes through the \"door.\" In an attempt to promote uniformity of training, multiple national organizations are currently delineating standard curricula for each trainee to govern the knowledge and cases required in a vascular residency. However, the outcomes are anything but uniform. This means that we graduate vascular specialists with a surprisingly wide spectrum of abilities. Use of simulation may benefit trainees in attaining a level of technical expertise that will benefit themselves and their patients. Furthermore, there is likely a need to establish a simulation-based certification process for graduating trainees to further ascertain minimum technical abilities.",

Endovascular repair has become an alternative for patients with ruptured AAA or other acute disease complications. The present study, however, attempted to use a common stent graft with the fenestration technique, rather than a customized one, in an emergency situation, to treat a giant pararenal AAA complicated by upper digestive tract obstruction, and assessed the results.\nA patient with a pararenal AAA was admitted emergently, with complications of upper digestive tract obstruction, including a tumor-like dilated segment of the abdominal aorta, 0.5-cm inferior to the ostia of the bilateral renal arteries, with a maximum diameter of 10.1 cm and a length of 18.5 cm. The patient underwent endovascular repair with a fenestrated endovascular stent graft to open the bilateral renal arteries 1 week later in an emergency situation.\nNo stenosis occurred at the openings of bilateral renal artery as a result of the stent, and the AAA was completely occluded. The patient experienced greatly ameliorated abdominal pain and upper digestive tract obstruction. At the 1-year follow-up examination, no exceptional symptoms were observed.\nThese results showed that for patients with a pararenal AAA who are unfit for open repair, or for those who cannot wait longer than 6 weeks for a customized fenestrated stent graft to be made, emergency field fenestration is feasible and successful, based on selection of the proper patient and accurate intraoperative localization.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare yet highly lethal injury associated with blunt force deceleration injury. The adoption of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has become a safer option than traditional open repair. The purpose of this study is to review a rural trauma center experience with TAI.\nA retrospective analysis was performed, reviewing all patients who presented with TAI between 2000 and 2009. Clinical, anatomical, and procedural variables of all cases were systematically reviewed. Clinical endpoints included mortality, and aortic-related mortality, and hospital length of stay. The study population was stratified by those that underwent surgical repair (SR) and those managed medically (MM).\nFifty-six patients presented with blunt TAI; 35 patients (62.5%) were surgically repaired (22 open, 13 TEVAR), while 21 (37.5%) were MM. The only difference in comorbidities was a higher rate of coronary artery disease in MM. Mean hospital arrival time (SR, 188.6 \u00b1 30.3 minutes, MM, 253 \u00b1 65.3 minutes), aortic injury grade (SR, 2.7 \u00b1 0.1; MM, 2.3 \u00b1 0.2), and injury severity score were not significantly different between the groups. Head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) was worse in the MM group, while chest AIS was worse in the SR group (P < .05). There were nine (42.9%) deaths in the MM group, while there were only two (5.7%) in the SR group (P < .001). There was no significant difference in aortic-related mortality. Mean follow-up time was not statistically different.\nThese data provide a group of stable patients to examine the management of TAI in the endovascular era. The low aortic-related mortality in the MM group demonstrates that there is time for a thorough evaluation in patients sustaining TAI who arrive without hemodynamic instability.",

    "abstract": "The principal aim of this study was to demonstrate that significant sac retraction (SSR) was a predictive marker of durable success after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). If verified, follow-up (FU) of patients with SSR may become unnecessary. In addition, the clinical features of the patients and aneurysms were analyzed to identify predictive factors of SSR.\nA group of 371 patients treated by EVAR had a complete clinical exam, computed tomography (CT) scan, and duplex scan follow-up. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. We assessed the difference between the largest diameter of the aneurysm (D) and the diameter of the stent-graft body (D1) on each postoperative CT scan. SSR was defined as a minimum of 75% reduction of this difference between the first and any of the following CT scans. Treatment success was defined as survival free of aneurysm-related death, type I or III endoleak, aneurysm expansion exceeding 5 mm, rupture, surgical conversion, migration, and graft occlusion. To assess the predictive factors of SSR, we performed a multivariable analysis and a logistic regression of the most significant variables.\nSSR was observed in 24.8% (92/371) of the patients after an average of 26 \u00b1 21 months of FU. The mean duration of FU in this group was 50 \u00b1 26 months (vs 45 \u00b1 25 months; P = NS). Survival was significantly longer in the SSR group (96 \u00b1 3 months vs 93 \u00b1 3 months; P < .05). No rupture, surgical, or endovascular conversion was reported in the SSR group. The frequency of type I (2.2% vs 15.4%; P < .001), type II (3.3% vs 29.4%; P < 10(-6)), and secondary interventions (3.3% vs 13.3%;P < .05) was lower in the SSR group. All type I and III endoleaks were diagnosed and treated before SSR detection. Since SSR was detected, treatment success remained until last follow-up in 98.9% (91 of 92) of the patients. The independent predictive factors of SSR were abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter < 55 mm (odds ratio [OR] 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.16-7.11), infra renal aorta diameter < 23 mm (OR 2.96; 95% CI: 1.74-5.03), and a proximal neck length > 22 mm (OR 2.41; 95% CI: 1.42-4.10).\nIn this series, SSR was accurately predictive of a durable success after EVAR. It occurred mostly in patients with a favorable anatomy. Less intensive follow-up work up seems to be safe in patients with SSR.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy (EVT) has been widely performed for peripheral artery disease. However, the high restenosis rate after EVT remains a major problem in patients on hemodialysis. Recent studies suggest that C-reactive protein (CRP) reflects vascular wall inflammation and can predict adverse events. We evaluated the possible prognostic values of CRP on outcomes in hemodialysis patients undergoing EVT.\nA total of 234 hemodialysis patients undergoing EVT for peripheral artery disease were enrolled and followed-up for up to 5 years. They were divided into tertiles according to serum CRP levels (lowest tertile, < 1.4 mg/L; middle tertile, 1.4-6.0 mg/L; highest tertile, \u2265 6.0 mg/L). We analyzed the incidence of any reintervention or above-ankle amputation of the limb index (RAO) and any-cause death.\nKaplan-Meier analysis showed that the event-free rate from the composite end point of RAO and any-cause death for 5 years was 60.2% in the lowest tertile, 50.0% in the middle tertile, and 25.1% in the highest tertile (P < .0001). The survival rate from any-cause death for 5 years was 81.5% in the lowest tertile, 65.2% in the middle tertile, and 59.3% in the highest tertile (P = .0078). Even after adjusting for other risk factors at baseline, preprocedural CRP levels were a significant predictive factor for RAO and any-cause death after EVT in a multivariable Cox analysis.\nElevated preprocedural serum CRP levels were associated with RAO and any-cause death after EVT in hemodialysis patients with peripheral artery disease.",

    "abstract": "With the decline of diagnostic angiography, clinicians increasingly rely upon duplex scan criteria to select appropriate asymptomatic candidates for carotid intervention. Some recent trials have enrolled patients for intervention based upon end diastolic velocities (EDVs) as low as 100 cm/second, and peak systolic velocities (PSVs) as low as 230 cm/second. In as much as we have used more selective duplex scan criteria, we reviewed the course of asymptomatic patients who had EDVs from 100 to 124 cm/second.\nOf the patients evaluated in our Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) accredited laboratory from 2002 to 2007, 144 patients had an EDV 100 to 124 cm/second. Of these, 47 patients underwent initial carotid intervention for concomitant symptoms (10), contralateral occlusion (3), or other imaging findings felt to warrant intervention. The remaining 97 asymptomatic patients were followed. One patient had both arteries fall within this EDV range. The mean follow-up for the 98 arteries was 29.1 months (range, 2-116 months).\nFive patients (5.2%) developed ipsilateral symptoms consisting of one stroke and four transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), at a mean time of 35.3 months (range, 12-58 months). Twenty-six patients (26.8%), including 3 who also developed ipsilateral symptoms, progressed to having an EDV of \u2265 125 cm/second at a mean time of 24 months (range, 2-58). Two of these (2.1%) progressed directly to occlusion without symptoms and with no documented interim worsening of stenosis.\nFor asymptomatic individuals with an initial EDV of 100 to 124 cm/second, the risk of ipsilateral stroke is small and, therefore, medical management is appropriate in most cases. However, the risk of progression to a more severe degree of stenosis, often warranting carotid intervention, is clinically meaningful. Yearly duplex scan follow-up is necessary to assess disease progression in this patient cohort.",

    "abstract": "Half of all lower limb deep vein thromboses (DVT) are distal DVT that are equally distributed between muscular calf vein thromboses (MCVT) and deep calf vein thromboses (DCVT). Despite their high prevalence, MCVT and DCVT have never been compared so far, which prevents possible modulation of distal DVT management according to the kind of distal DVT (MCVT or DCVT).\nUsing data from the French, multicenter, prospective observational OPTimisation de l'Interrogatoire dans l'\u00e9valuation du risque throMbo-Embolique Veineux (OPTIMEV) study, we compared the clinical presentation and risk factors of 268 symptomatic isolated DCVT and 457 symptomatic isolated MCVT and the 3-month outcomes of the 222 DCVT and 390 MCVT that were followed-up.\nDuring the entire follow-up, 86.5% of DCVT patients and 76.7% of MCVT patients were treated with anticoagulant drugs (P = .003).

    "abstract": "In July 2007, our group began to use a modified conical inferior vena cava filter with additional stabilizing struts designed to reduce tilting of retrievable filters. We analyzed our experience with this modified filter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 and compared it to our experience with the standard filter (G\u00fcnther Tulip, Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008 to determine if adoption of the modified filter reduced tilting and delivered a discernible clinical benefit.\nThe primary outcome measure was tilt angle after deployment. Secondary outcomes were change in tilt angle between deployment and retrieval (self-centering) and retrieval failure due to inability to engage the filter hook. Measurements were retrospectively determined using the anteroposterior venogram at the time of placement and removal. Tilt angle was defined by the center line of the filter relative to the center line of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Statistical significance was assumed for P \u2264 .05.\nDuring the study period, a total of 302 IVC filters were placed. Retrieval was attempted for 85 of 194 (44%) standard filters and 52 of 108 (48%) modified filters. The overall difference in tilt angle (degrees) between the standard (median [interquartile range] = 5 [3, 8]) and modified (5 [3, 8]) filters at the time of placement was not statistically significant (P = .44). Modified filters deployed through a femoral route (8 [4, 11]) had significantly greater tilt angles than modified filters deployed using jugular access (4 [2, 6]; P < .0001). At the time of retrieval, evidence of self-centering was observed more often with modified (32 of 52 [62%]) than standard (36 of 85 [42%]) filters (P = .03). Overall, there were only four failures to retrieve the filter due to excess tilting (standard, 3 of 85 [4%], modified, 1 of 52 [2%]; P = .59).\nOverall, tilt angle at insertion did not differ between the modified and standard filters, although more modified filters displayed self-centering. There was no difference between the groups in retrieval failure due to excess tilting. Despite its greater tendency to self-center, we did not recognize a measurable clinical advantage of the modified filter.",

We hypothesized that PPAR\u03b3 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) attenuates the development of AAA. We also investigated PPAR\u03b3-mediated signaling pathways that may prevent the development of AAA.\nWe determined whether periaortic application of CaCl(2) renders vascular SMC-selective PPAR\u03b3 knockout (SMPG KO) mice more susceptible to destruction of normal aortic wall architecture.\nThere is evidence of increased vessel dilatation in the abdominal aorta 6 weeks after 0.25M periaortic CaCl(2) application in SMPG KO mice compared with littermate controls (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 mm [n = 8] vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 mm [n = 7]; P = .000119). Results from SMPG KO mice indicate medial layer elastin degradation was greater 6 weeks after abluminal application of CaCl(2) to the abdominal aorta (P < .01). Activated cathepsin S, a potent elastin-degrading enzyme, was increased in SMPG KO mice vs wild-type controls. To further identify a role of PPAR\u03b3 signaling in reducing the development of AAA, we demonstrated that adenoviral-mediated PPAR\u03b3 overexpression in cultured rat aortic SMCs decreases (P = .022) the messenger RNA levels of cathepsin S. In addition, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay detected PPAR\u03b3 bound to a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) -141 to -159 bp upstream of the cathepsin S gene sequence in mouse aortic SMCs. Also, adenoviral-mediated PPAR\u03b3 overexpression and knockdown in cultured rat aortic SMCs decreases (P = .013) and increases (P = .018) expression of activated cathepsin S. Finally, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a greater inflammatory infiltrate in SMPG KO mouse aortas, as evidenced by elevations in F4/80 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 expression.\nIn this study, we identify PPAR\u03b3 as an important contributor in attenuating the development of aortic aneurysms by demonstrating that loss of PPAR\u03b3 in vascular SMCs promotes aortic dilatation and elastin degradation. Thus, PPAR\u03b3 activation may be potentially promising medical therapy in reducing the risk of AAA progression and rupture.",

    "abstract": "Despite the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage criteria for carotid artery stenting (CAS), consensus regarding its appropriateness in patients with carotid artery stenosis has not been reached. This is one of the first population-based studies to use a dedicated administrative convention for the endovascular procedure to address whether there is a cohort of patients in whom CAS is more beneficial than carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nWe analyzed in-hospital mortality, postoperative stroke, and combined postoperative stoke/mortality in 47,752 CAS or CEA hospitalizations, matched by propensity score, in discharge data sets obtained from the states of New York and California for the years 2005 to 2007. Other outcomes included postoperative complications, length of stay, and volume-outcome relationships.\nFor symptomatic patients undergoing CAS, rates were significantly higher for in-hospital mortality (3.7% vs 1.3%) and combined stroke/mortality (8.3% vs 4.6%) compared with CEA. For asymptomatic patients, there was no statistical difference between mortality (0.6% vs 0.4%), stroke (2.0% vs 1.8%), or combined stroke/mortality (2.4% vs 1.9%) across the endovascular and open procedures, respectively. Postoperative respiratory and urinary complications as well as cranial neuropathy were more common after CEA, whereas postoperative complications, including device malfunction and hypotension, were more frequent after CAS. We did not find a volume-outcome relationship for CEA, but one did exist for CAS.\nIn symptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis, the most appropriate procedure appears to be CEA, whereas CAS appears to be a suitable minimally invasive approach for asymptomatic patients. On the basis of these results and data from recent multicenter randomized trials, the use of CAS in symptomatic patients should be approached with caution.",

Patient medical records were retrieved, and survival was analyzed with multivariate Cox-regression analysis.\nThe number of revascularizations of the SMA increased over time with 41 operations in 2006, compared to 10 in 1999. Endovascular approach increased sixfold by 2006 as compared to 1999. The endovascular group had thrombotic occlusion (P < .001) and history of abdominal angina (P = .042) more often, the open group had atrial fibrillation more frequently (P = .031).

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that the loss of compression pressure of inelastic bandages is associated with a loss of efficacy in contrast to elastic material, which maintains its pressure and performance. This study compared the effect exerted by inelastic bandages vs elastic compression stockings on the venous pumping function in patients with severe superficial venous insufficiency immediately after application and 1 week later.\nEjection fraction (EF) of the calf pump was measured in 18 patients presenting with bilateral reflux in the great saphenous vein (CEAP C(3)-C(5)) without any compression and immediately after application of an inelastic bandage on one leg and an elastic compression stocking on the other leg. Measurements were repeated 1 week later, before compression removal. EF was measured using a plethysmographic technique. The changes of interface pressure of the applied compression products were recorded simultaneously with EF measurements.\nAfter application, bandages and stockings achieved a significant improvement of EF (P < .001) that was much more pronounced in the bandaged legs. The median resting pressure was 45 mm Hg (interquartile range, 41-48.5 mm Hg) under the stockings and 64.5 mm Hg (interquartile range, 51-80 mm Hg) under the bandages. After 1 week, EF was still significantly improved in the bandaged leg (P < .001), but not under the stockings. At this time, the pressure under the stockings was only slightly reduced (5.9% supine, 3.6% standing), but the mean pressure loss under the bandages was much higher (54.3% supine, 35.4% standing).\nThe findings supporting inelastic compression are important in explaining the benefits of its use in chronic venous insufficiency. Inelastic bandages maintain their superior efficacy on the venous pumping function after a wearing time of 1 week, despite a significant loss of pressure.",

    "abstract": "Level I evidence shows conventional carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with patch angioplasty results in lower rates of restenosis. However, whether this information has affected practice patterns and outcomes in real-world vascular surgery settings is unclear.\nWithin the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE), we studied 2981 patients undergoing 2981 first-time CEAs between January 1, 2003, and June 31, 2008. Rates of restenosis (defined by duplex ultrasound imaging at the 1-year follow-up) were estimated using life-table analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify multivariable predictors of postoperative restenosis \u2264 1 year.\nAcross 58 surgeons and 11 hospitals, we studied 2611 conventional CEAs (88% of all CEAs) and 370 eversion CEAs (12% of all CEAs). Median follow-up was 12.8 months (range, 1-35 months). The proportion of conventional CEAs performed with patching increased from 87% to 96% (P < .001) between 2003 and 2008, whereas eversion CEA declined from 18% to 5% (P < .001). Restenosis occurred in 303 patients (10%); by life-table analysis, the restenosis rate at 1 year was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7%-6.8%). Restenoses were most commonly noncritical: 50%-79% restenosis in 7.9%, 80%-99% restenosis in 1.7%, and occlusion in 0.5%. Univariate analyses showed significant differences in 80% to 100% restenosis by procedure type (2% in conventional CEA, 6% in eversion CEA, P < .002), the year of procedure (3.2% in 2003, 0% in 2008; P < .03), and use of patching in conventional CEA (2.9% no patch, 1% with patch; P < .008). By multivariable analysis, absence of patching (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.5-7.0), contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis > 80% (HR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.4-11.5), and dialysis dependence (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2-9.8) were independently associated with a higher risk of an 80% to 100% restenosis. Of the 51 patients with 80% to 99% restenosis, 14 underwent reintervention \u2264 1 year, comprising 4 reoperations and 10 carotid artery stent procedures. Of the 15 patients with a carotid occlusion \u2264 1 year, transient ischemic attacks occurred in 2 and a disabling stroke in 1.\nIn our region, restenosis after CEA, especially clinically significant restenosis \u2264 1 year after surgery, decreased slightly over time. This improvement in outcome was associated with several factors, including an increase in patching after conventional CEA, a process of care that was studied and encouraged within our vascular study group. These results highlight the utility of regional quality-improvement efforts in improving outcomes in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "The use of stent grafts and mortality of stent graft repair of type B thoracic aortic dissection (T(B)AD) is not well defined. We sought to determine national estimates for the use and mortality of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for T(B)AD in the United States.\nRecords of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2005 and 2007 were examined. International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) diagnosis codes were used to select patients who underwent open or TEVAR with a stent graft for a diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection or thoracoabdominal aortic dissection. We excluded patients with a diagnosis code for aortic aneurysm and those with procedure codes for cardioplegia or for operations on heart vessels or valves, which were considered type A dissections (T(A)AD). The remaining patients were considered as T(B)AD. We compared demographics and comorbidities, as well as adjusted complications and mortality rates, between patients undergoing TEVAR vs open repair.\nWe identified an estimated 10,466 repairs for dissection of the thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta (open, 8659; TEVAR, 1818). Of these, 464 had a diagnosis of aortic aneurysm, and 5002 patients were considered T(A)AD. Of nonaneurysmal dissections, 5000 repairs were considered T(B)AD (open, 3619; TEVAR, 1381). The endovascular patients were older and had greater comorbidities, although only cardiac disease, renal failure, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease were statistically significant. In-hospital mortality was 19% for open repair vs 10.6% for TEVAR (odds ratio [OR], 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-3.67; P < .01). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher with open repairs coded as emergent admissions (20.1% vs 13.1%; P = .03), but did not reach statistical significance for elective admissions (12.3% vs 4.8%; P = .09). Cardiac complications (12.4% vs 4.9%, P < .01), respiratory complications (7.7% vs 4.3%, P = .02), genitourinary complications (9.0% vs 2.5%, P < .01), hemorrhage (14.0% vs 2.8%, P < .01), and acute renal failure (32.1% vs 17.2%, P < .01) were more frequent in the open repair group. Median length of stay was greater in the open repair group (10.7 vs 8.3 days, P < .01).\nFor patients with a diagnosis of T(B)AD who undergo repair, the endovascular approach is being used for older patients with greater comorbidities, yet has reduced morbidity and in-hospital mortality. The use of endovascular stent graft repair for type B thoracic aortic dissection merits further longitudinal analysis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the dilatation of the aortic root and the diameters of the rest of the aorta and to identify some related factors that could be used to identify patients at higher risk of presenting with an aortic aneurysm.\nIn 71 consecutive patients with a dilated aortic root identified by transthoracic echocardiography, prospective helical computed tomography was performed. Aortic diameters were measured perpendicular to the flow at seven levels in the thoracic and abdominal aorta.\nAscending aorta diameter showed a moderate correlation with aortic indexed diameters at the thoracic and abdominal level in tricuspid aortic valve patients (r ranging from 0.37-0.56), whereas in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, a moderate correlation between the ascending aorta diameters and the thoracic descending aorta diameters was observed (r 0.51-0.53). In a multivariate analysis, age was independently related to indexed diameter at all aortic sites (\u03b2 ranging from 0.06-0.12 per year), whereas aortic regurgitation was independently related only to thoracic aorta diameter (\u03b2 ranging from 1.17-1.84). Age (P < .0001), body surface area (P < .0001), and grade of aortic valve regurgitation (P = .001) independently predicted aortic volume.\nDifferent patterns of aortic diameters were observed in patients with dilated aortic root, depending on age, aortic valve morphology, and function. When a dilated aortic root is detected in older patients with a tricuspid aortic valve, an accurate cardiovascular survey that includes the entire aorta is needed.

    "abstract": "The efficacy of tibial artery endovascular intervention (TAEI) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) and particularly for wound healing is not fully defined. The purpose of this study is to determine predictors of failure and success for TAEI in the setting of CLI.\nAll TAEI for tissue loss or rest pain (Rutherford classes 4, 5, and 6) from 2004 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical outcomes and patency rates were analyzed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression and life table analysis.\nOne hundred twenty-three limbs in 111 patients (62% male, mean age 74) were treated. Sixty-seven percent of patients were diabetics, 55% had renal insufficiency, and 21% required hemodialysis. One hundred two limbs (83%) exhibited tissue loss; all others had ischemic rest pain. All patients underwent tibial angioplasty (PTA). Tibial excimer laser atherectomy was performed in 14% of the patients. Interventions were performed on multiple tibial vessels in 20% of limbs. Isolated tibial procedures were performed on 50 limbs (41%), while 73 patients had concurrent ipsilateral superficial femoral artery or popliteal interventions. The mean distal popliteal and tibial runoff score improved from 11.8 \u00b1 3.6 to 6.7 \u00b1 1.6 (P < .001), and the mean ankle-brachial index increased from 0.61 \u00b1 0.26 to 0.85 \u00b1 0.22 (P < .001). Surgical bypass was required in seven patients (6%). The mean follow up was 6.8 \u00b1 6.6 months, while the 1-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were 33%, 50%, and 56% respectively. Limb salvage rate at 1 year was 75%. Factors found to be associated with impaired limb salvage included renal insufficiency (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.7; P = .03) and the need for pedal intervention (HR = 13.75; P = .04). TAEI in an isolated peroneal artery (odds ratio = 7.80; P = .01) was associated with impaired wound healing, whereas multilevel intervention (HR = 2.1; P = .009) and tibial laser atherectomy (HR = 3.1; P = .01) were predictors of wound healing. In patients with tissue loss, 41% achieved complete closure (mean time to healing, 10.7 \u00b1 7.4 months), and 39% exhibited partial wound healing (mean follow up, 4.4 \u00b1 4.8 months) at last follow up. Diabetes, smoking, statin therapy, and revascularization of > 1 tibial vessel had no impact on limb salvage or wound healing. Re-intervention rate was 50% at 1 year.\nTAEI is an effective treatment for CLI with acceptable limb salvage and wound healing rates, but requires a high rate of reintervention. Patients with renal failure, pedal disease, or isolated peroneal runoff have poor outcomes with TAEI and should be considered for surgical bypass.",

    "abstract": "Reports of duplex sonography scan criteria for recurrent renal arterial (RA) stenosis after endoluminal stenting have suggested that criteria for native arteries may overestimate recurrent disease. This retrospective report examines the utility of renal duplex sonography (RDS) scans to define the presence of significant (ie, \u2265 60%) renovascular disease (RVD) after percutaneous angioplasty and endoluminal stenting (PTAS).\nDemographic, duplex, and angiographic data were reviewed and compared. RDS was obtained. Peak systolic velocities (PSV) were obtained after PTAS from multiple sites along the main RA from both anterior and flank approaches. Comparable images from digital subtraction angiography were independently examined for restenosis. Percent diameter stenosis was determined from the site of maximal stenosis compared with the normal RA distal to the stent. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed after adjusting for within patient \"clustering\" of observations applying native RA RDS criteria using angiography as the gold standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to estimate the optimal RDS values for recurrent stenosis.\nFrom October 2003 to June 2009, 49 patients had angiographic imaging after PTAS. There were 30 patients (18 women, 12 men; mean age, 71 \u00b1 9 years) provided technically adequate paired angiographic and RDS assessment after PTAS for 66 RAs. Paired analysis was performed for 23 RAs after primary PTAS and 43 RAs after secondary treatment. The prevalence of significant restenosis was 35% (23 of 66 RAs). RAs with greater than 60% diameter restenosis had higher peak systolic velocity (PSV) compared to those without (2.48 \u00b1 1.15 millisecond vs 1.44 \u00b1 0.58 millisecond; P < .001). Compared to angiography, RA-PSV \u2265 1.8 millisecond with distal RA turbulence demonstrated a sensitivity of 73% (95% CI, 54%, 91%), specificity of 80% (95% CI, 67%, 93%), and an overall accuracy of 77% (95% CI, 67%, 88%) with a positive predictive value of 64% (95% CI, 46%, 82%). Optimal RDS value estimated by ROC curve resulted in RA-PSV of 2.5 millisecond which was associated with a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 36%, 82%), specificity of 95% (95% CI, 89%, 100%), an accuracy of 83% (95% CI, 74%, 92%), and a positive predictive value of 87% (95% CI, 68%, 100%).\nRenal duplex sonography has utility to detect significant restenosis after PTAS. RDS criteria for significant native RA stenosis compare favorably with optimal RDS criteria for restenosis estimated by ROC curves.",

    "abstract": "Lymph transportation through the body is partly controlled by the intrinsic pumping of lymphatic vessels. Although an understanding of this process is important for medical application, little is currently known because it is difficult to measure. Here, we introduce an easy, safe, and cost-effective technique for measuring lymphatic pumping in leg superficial lymphatic vessels. Readings obtained with this technique were compared with values obtained with dynamic lymphoscintigraphy. Differences in lymphatic pumping between healthy volunteers and patients with lymphedema were also investigated.\nIndocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence lymphography was performed by subcutaneously injecting 0.3 mL of ICG (0.5%) into the dorsum of the foot. Real-time fluorescence images of lymph propulsion were obtained with an infrared-light camera system with the individual supine or sitting. A custom-made transparent sphygmomanometer cuff was wrapped around the lower leg and connected to a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The cuff was inflated to 60 mm Hg and then gradually deflated at 5-minute intervals to lower the pressure by 10-mm Hg steps until the fluorescence contrast agent exceeded the upper border of the cuff, indicating that the lymphatic contraction had overcome the cuff pressure. Lymph pumping pressure (P(pump)) was defined as the value of the cuff pressure when the contrast agent exceeded the upper border of the cuff. We measured P(pump) among healthy volunteers who maintained a supine position and compared these values with measurements obtained from lymphoscintigraphy. P(pump) values while sitting were also compared between 30 legs from healthy volunteers and 30 legs from lymphedematous patients.\nAmong healthy, supine participants, P(pump) was 25.2 \u00b1 16.7 mm Hg (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) when measured by ICG fluorescence lymphography. These values were significantly correlated with values taken using dynamic lymphoscintigraphy (r(2) = 0.54, p < .01), while 2 SDs of the mean were approximately 20 mm Hg, suggesting a substantial disagreement between the two methods (Bland-Altman plots). In the comparison of seated measurements, readings for healthy participants (P(pump) = 29.3 \u00b1 16.0) were higher than those for lymphedematous participants (13.2 \u00b1 14.9).\nICG fluorescence is an accurate-as well as a safe, easy, and economical-method of measuring lymphatic pumping. Therefore, it may develop as a vital tool for diagnosing lymphatic malfunctions even when they are only in their formative stages. Studies that use this technique may increase our knowledge of the lymphatic system as a whole, allowing us to develop better treatments for lymphatic disorders.",

    "abstract": "In 1992, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services instituted the Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) system to determine physician reimbursement. Relative value units (RVU) were assigned to each Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) code and intended to reflect the time and intensity of work. Little data exist correlating actual procedural and clinical time with respect to reimbursement within the RVU value system. The purpose of this study was to determine how well this system distributes payments per hour for hospital-based procedures in a single vascular practice in the state of Maryland between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009.\nAs part of an ongoing prospective outcomes program, procedural times for all vascular procedures (time into until time out of room) were recorded. Fifteen minutes were added for administrative functions on procedural day, each hospital day, and office visits during the global period. The combination of all times was reflected in the total care time (TCT) for each procedure. We recorded all physician fees collected for each procedure. This total fee collected for each procedure was then divided by the TCT to determine the procedure-specific payment per unit time. All similar procedures were grouped together and the average reimbursement per procedure was reported.\nData was collected on all 1103 procedures performed during this period. Insurance carrier distribution was 75% Medicare and 25% private insurance. The average reimbursement was $316/hour for open procedures and $556/hour for endovascular. Higher reimbursing procedures included visceral endovascular procedures ($701/hour) and caval filters ($751/hour). Lower reimbursing procedures included lower extremity bypass ($292/hour), dialysis access ($268/hour) and lower extremity amputations ($223/hour). Striking was the difference between payment based on approach for similar conditions. Reimbursement for carotid stent vs carotid endarterectomy was $643/hour vs $383/hour, endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair vs open $593/hour vs $359/hour.\nThis unique study demonstrates a \"real world\" experience of reimbursement per unit time and raises questions as to the validity of the RBRVS process. The disparity between payments for open and endovascular repair of similar conditions are typical of this inequality. These data do not reflect the intangible time of operative planning, administrative matters, or overhead, and these factors must be considered when interpreting this data. Regardless, this study suggests that capturing detailed financial data is possible and is a more accurate source for future discussions on reimbursement.",

    "abstract": "The altered structure and composition of the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2), which is a Ca(2+)-dependent cross-linking enzyme, has been proven the importance for ECM homeostasis, but there is no evidence of TG2 in AAA formation. The hypothesis was investigated that TG2 contributes to protect aortic walls during remodeling of the AAAs.\nIn a rat abdominal aortic aneurysm model using a combination of intraluminal elastase infusion and extraluminal calcium chloride, TG2 expression and activity were evaluated at 1 and 8 weeks after the AAA preparation (n = 6 at each endpoint), compared with those of the non-prepared aorta (n = 6). Additionally, ex vivo experiments of isolated AAA tissue culture with recombinant human TG2, TG2 inhibitor cystamine, or tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were performed.\nTG2 mRNA expression in the AAAs was significantly upregulated at both 1 and 8 weeks (22.4-fold and 5.4-fold increases of the non-prepared aorta, P = .0022 and P = .0048, respectively). TG2 protein expression and activity were also enhanced by fluorescent staining of the AAAs. Similar mRNA upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 was observed in the AAAs, and TG2 and TNF-\u03b1 were colocalized in the aortic walls at 1 week. Ex vivo experiments showed that mRNA expressions of TNF-\u03b1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the cultured AAA tissue were decreased by exogenous TG2, whereas were increased by cystamine. TNF-\u03b1 exposure to the AAA tissues was significantly upregulated TG2 mRNA expression (P = .0333).\nTG2 expression and activity in AAA formation were enhanced, possibly due to compensatory reaction. TG2 has a potential role of ECM protector in aortic walls during remodeling of the AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support (ECMO/CPS) are potentially life-saving techniques for patients with cardiopulmonary collapse. Complications include lower extremity ischemia from femoral artery cannulation. We examined the outcomes of patients placed on ECMO/CPS, including the rate of limb ischemia.\nAll instances of ECMO/CPS over a 3-year period (2006-2009) at a single university hospital were examined retrospectively for cannulation strategy, perfusion strategy, mortality, and limb ischemia. Potential predictors of limb ischemia with femoral artery cannulation were age, gender, body surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), and arterial cannula size.\nFifty-eight patients were placed on ECMO/CPS. Of these, 43 patients (74%) had femoral arterial cannulation. In 10 patients, the superficial femoral artery (SFA) was cannulated prophylactically (without antecedent limb ischemia) and perfused in the antegrade direction from a branch of the ECMO/CPS circuit. In 7 of the remaining 33 patients (21%), limb ischemia developed requiring decannulation with fasciotomy (n = 4) or additional cannulation of the SFA with branching of the ECMO/CPS circuit (n = 3). One patient with ipsilateral leg ischemia required eventual amputation. Patients with limb ischemia were significantly younger than those who did not develop limb ischemia (P = .001). BSA, BMI, and cannula size did not predict limb ischemia. Overall 30-day mortality following the initiation of ECMO/CPS was 79%. There was no correlation between limb ischemia and mortality.\nYounger patients may be at increased risk for lower extremity arterial insufficiency with femoral cannulation for ECMO/CPS. Prophylactic or expectant SFA cannulation are reasonable approaches.",

With the advent of endovascular grafting, physicians have the ability to reconstruct the thoracic aortic transection using a less invasive technique. In this study, we examine our experience with stent graft repair of thoracic transections secondary to trauma.\nThe medical records of patients treated at a level I trauma center from 2005 to 2008 were reviewed. Those patients who had an aortic transection treated with an endograft were identified and evaluated for in-hospital mortality and morbidity and concurrent injuries. Demographics, procedural details, and outcomes were analyzed.\nOver a 3-year period, 18 thoracic aortic transections secondary to trauma were identified in patients with a mean age of 43 (range, 16-80). Primary technical success was 100%. None of the patients required explant or open repair during this time period. In-hospital mortality was 2 of 18 (11%); all patients had multiple trauma including long bone fractures. The subclavian artery origin was covered by the stent graft in 9 of the 18 patients. The mean estimated blood loss per procedure was 222 cc. No patient in this series had postoperative paraplegia. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 50 months with an average of 13 months. There have been no late explantation or device failures identified.\nEndovascular repair of traumatic thoracic aortic transections can be performed safely with a relatively low mortality and morbidity and should be the procedure of choice for patients presenting with traumatic thoracic aortic ruptures.",

    "abstract": "To provide a solid baseline reference for quality of life (QoL) in patients with no-option critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is associated with surgery, endovascular interventions, hospitalization, and a poor prognosis. An increasing number of clinical trials are, therefore, investigating new treatment strategies (eg, therapeutic neovascularization) in patients with CLI. QoL serves as an important secondary endpoint in many of these trials, but solid reference QoL data for patients with no-option CLI are lacking.\nThe Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaires were used to obtain baseline QoL scores from 47 patients with no-option CLI participating in a therapeutic neovascularization trial. To allow for easy comparability, a norm-based scoring (NBS) method was used to report the results of the SF-36. Scores of patients with CLI were furthermore compared with scores of patients with milder forms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and with patients with cardiovascular risk factors only. Determinants of QoL in patients with PAD were identified using multiple linear regression methods.\nPatients with no-option CLI reported QoL scores below the general population mean on every health dimension of the SF-36. Physical functioning, role physical functioning, and bodily pain were affected most intensively. These poor physical QoL scores were further underlined when compared with other patients with milder forms of PAD or patients with cardiovascular risk factors only. Patients with CLI scored poorly on the pain/discomfort and the usual activities domain of the EQ-5D. Diabetes, female gender, body mass index, and the ankle-brachial index at rest were significant determinants of the QoL in PAD on multivariate analysis.\nThe QoL data of patients with no-option CLI using NBS methods for the SF-36 provide a baseline reference for ongoing clinical trials on new treatment strategies. Our data stress the need for new revascularization therapies in patients with no-option CLI.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that the threshold for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) suitable for endovascular repair (EVAR) be lowered. A critical step in this pathway is determining whether smaller AAAs are more likely to be anatomically suitable for EVAR; that is, whether suitability is lost as the AAA grows.\nPatients who underwent ultrasound (US) imaging for asymptomatic AAAs at the University of Rochester Medical Center between January 1, 2003, and January 31, 2007, were identified. All those who had an abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan \u2264 3 months of the US imaging were identified. CT scans were reviewed using predefined criteria to assess anatomic suitability for conventional EVAR (ie, without consideration of debranching).\nOf 3005 aortic US studies performed during this period, 221 had CT scans showing infrarenal aneurysms. Of these, 168 patients (76%) were candidates for EVAR and 52 (24%) were not, most commonly due to a short neck (40; 77% of excluded). Size measured by CT scanning (mean, 53 \u00b1 11 mm) averaged 4 mm larger than by US imaging (mean, 49 \u00b1 10 mm; r(2) = 0.66; P < .0001). Aneurysm size measured by CT scanning (P < .0001) or US imaging (P < .0001) correlated with anatomic suitability for EVAR. Mean sizes for those suitable were 52 \u00b1 9 mm by CT and 48 \u00b1 7 mm by US imaging, whereas mean sizes for those not suitable were 58 \u00b1 10 mm by CT and 53 \u00b1 8 mm by US imaging. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that an US cutoff of 4.87 mm best predicted anatomic suitability (86.2% if smaller, 64.8% if larger), whereas a CT cutoff of 57.0 mm best predicted suitability (84.7% if smaller, 63.2% if larger).\nAneurysm size measured by CT averaged 4 mm larger than by US imaging. Larger aneurysms are less likely to be anatomically suitable for EVAR, but the rate of suitability does not appreciably decrease until the aneurysm measures 49 mm by US imaging or 57 mm by CT scanning. This implies that waiting until the aneurysm reaches currently accepted size criteria for repair does not result in \"missing the window\" for EVAR; in other words, just as many patients are anatomically suitable for EVAR at currently accepted size cutoffs than if earlier intervention had been done.",

    "abstract": "It remains unclear whether population-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men reduces all-cause long-term mortality. We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of AAA screening for prevention of long-term mortality in men.\nTo identify all randomized controlled trials of population-based AAA screening with long-term (\u2265 10 year) follow-up in men, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through June 2009. Data regarding AAA-related and all-cause mortality (including Cox regression hazard ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were abstracted from each individual study. For each study, data regarding mortality in both the screening and control groups were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic ORs or HRs (or risk ratios where no HR was reported) in both fixed- and random-effects models.\nOur search identified four randomized controlled trials of population-based AAA screening with long-term follow-up in men aged \u2265 65 years. Pooled analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (random-effects OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.86; P = .008; P for heterogeneity = .01; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 4 per 1000; number needed to screen [NNS], 238; random-effects HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.86; P = .009; P for heterogeneity = .009) and revealed a statistically nonsignificant reduction (but a strong trend toward a significant reduction) in all-cause mortality (fixed-effects OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.00 [1.001]; P = .06; P for heterogeneity = .93; ARR, 5 per 1000; NNS, 217; fixed-effects HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.00 [1.0001]; P \u2265 .05 [P = .052]; P for heterogeneity = .74) with AAA screening relative to control.\nThe results of our analysis suggest that population-based screening for AAA reduces AAA-related long-term mortality by 4 per 1000 over control in men aged \u2265 65 years. Whereas, screening for AAA shows a strong trend toward a significant reduction in all-cause long-term mortality by 5 per 1000, which does not narrowly reach statistical significance.",

    "abstract": "Standardizing surgical skills teaching has been proposed as a method to rapidly attain technical competence. This study compared acquisition of vascular skills by standardized vs traditional teaching methods.\nThe study randomized 18 first-year surgical residents to a standardized or traditional group. Participants were taught technical aspects of vascular anastomosis using femoral anastomosis simulation (Limbs & Things, Savannah, Ga), supplemented with factual information. One expert instructor taught a standardized anastomosis technique using the same method each time to one group over four sessions, while, similar to current vascular training, four different expert instructors each taught one session to the other (traditional) group. Knowledge and technical skill were assessed at study completion by an independent vascular expert using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) performance metrics. Participants also provided a written evaluation of the study experience.\nThe standardized group had significantly higher mean overall technical (95.7% vs 75.8%; P = .038) and global skill scores (83.4% vs 67%; P = .006). Tissue handling, efficiency of motion, overall technical skill, and flow of operation were rated significantly higher in the standardized group (mean range, 88%-96% vs 67.6%-77.6%; P < .05). The standardized group trended to better cognitive knowledge (mean, 68.8% vs 60.7%; P = .182), creation of a secure knot at the toe of the anastomosis, fashioning an appropriate arteriotomy, better double-ended suture placement at the heel of the anastomosis (100% vs 62.7%; P = .07), and accurate suture placement (70% vs 25%; P = .153). Seventy-two percent of participant evaluations suggested a preference for a standardized approach.\nThis study demonstrates the feasibility of open vascular simulation to assess the effect of differing teaching methods on performance outcome. Findings from this report suggest that for simulation training, standardized may be more effective than traditional methods of teaching. Transferability of simulator-acquired skills to the clinical setting will be required before open simulation can be unequivocally recommended as a major component of resident technical skill training.",

    "abstract": "Although chronic aortic dissection (CD) has traditionally been considered a predictor of perioperative morbidity and mortality after descending thoracic/thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair (thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm [TAA]), recent reports have rejected this assertion. Still, few contemporary studies document late outcomes after TAA for CD, which is the goal of this study.\nFrom August 1987 to December 2005, 480 patients underwent TAA; 73 (15%) CD and 407 (85%) degenerative aneurysms (DA). Operative management consisted of a clamp-and-sew technique with adjuncts in 53 (78%) CD and 355 (93%) DA patients (P < .001). Epidural cooling was used to prevent spinal cord injury (SCI) in 51 (70%) CD and 214 (53%) DA patients (P = .007). Study end points included perioperative SCI/mortality, freedom from reintervention, and long-term survival.\nCD patients were younger (mean age 64.5 years CD vs 72.5 years DA, P < .001) and more frequently had a family history of aneurysmal disease (23% CD vs 6% DA, P < .001). Forty-three (59%) CD patients had elective TAA (vs 322 (79%) DA, P = .001). Eleven (15%) CD patients had Marfan's syndrome (vs 0% DA, P < .001), and 17 (23%) CD patients had a prior arch or ascending aortic repair (vs 16 [4%] DA, P < .001). CD patients were more likely to have Crawford type I & II thoracoabdominal aneurysms (44 [60%] vs 120 [29%] DA, P < .001), while only two (3%) CD patients had type IV aneurysms (vs 99 [24%] DA). There was no difference in perioperative mortality between the two groups (11% CD vs 8.6% DA, P = .52), nor was there a difference in flaccid paralysis, which occurred in five (7%) CD and 22 (5%) DA patients (P = .92). At 5 years, 70% of CD patients were free from reintervention versus 74% of DA (P = .36). The actuarial survival was 53% and 32% at 5 and 10 years for CD versus 47% and 17% for DA (P = .07).\nDespite increased operative complexity, CD does not appear to increase perioperative SCI or mortality after TAA when compared with DA. Long-term freedom from aneurysm-related reintervention is similar for both groups as is survival, despite patients with CD being of younger age at presentation.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is increasingly becoming the standard treatment of many thoracic aortic pathologies. New reliable and accurate stent grafts are emerging to widen the endovascular treatment options. We report the results of RELAY (Bolton Medical, Barcelona, Spain) in the large RELAY Endovascular Registry for Thoracic Disease (RESTORE) European registry.\nRESTORE is a multicenter, prospective European registry involving 22 centers in seven European countries. The RELAY device is composed of a stent graft (self-expanding nitinol stents and a polyester vascular graft) and a delivery device specifically designed for the thoracic aorta. Included were acute and elective patients presenting with a variety of pathologies (aneurysms, dissections, ulcerations, intramural hematomas, pseudoaneurysms) and lesions in different aortic and anatomic locations (ascending, arch, descending and thoracoabdominal).\nThe registry enrolled 304 patients from April 2005 to January 2009. All-cause mortality at 30 days was 7.2%. Freedom from all cause mortality and freedom from device- and procedure-related mortality at 2 years were 78.5% and 95.9%, respectively. An average of 1.26 graft components were used per patient, with a technical success of 97.7% irrespective of the etiology. Early endoleak rate was 4.6%. Perioperatively, stroke and paraplegia were registered in 1.6% and 2.0%, respectively.\nThe results of RESTORE support the safety of thoracic endovascular aortic repair with the RELAY stent graft, even in acute and complicated situations. The device was highly efficient in angulated aortic anatomies, with acceptable mortality and a low rate of neurologic complications.",

    "abstract": "The Vascular Surgery Board (VSB) of the American Board of Surgery sought to answer the following questions: what is the scope of contemporary vascular surgery practice? Do current vascular surgery residents obtain training that is appropriate for their future career expectations and for successful Board certification? How effectively do practicing vascular surgeons incorporate emerging technologies and procedures into practice?\nWe analyzed the operative logs submitted to the VSB by recent vascular surgery residents applying for the Vascular Surgery Qualifying Examination (QE; 2006-2009) or by practicing vascular surgeons applying for the Vascular Surgery Recertification Examination (RE; 1995-2009). The relationship between reported operative experience and performance of the QE and RE was examined.\nThere has been a threefold increase in the mean number of primary cases reported by both RE and QE applicants over the past 15 years and the increase in case volume has been driven largely by an increase in the number of endovascular procedures. Endovascular procedures have been broadly incorporated into the practice of most vascular surgeons applying for recertification. The number of major open surgical cases reported by recent QE applicants has remained unchanged over the period of observation. For QE applicants, the number of endovascular aneurysm repairs (EVARs) has reached a plateau at approximately 50 cases, whereas the mean number of open infrarenal aneurysm repairs has decreased for both QE and RE applicants, reflecting national trends favoring EVAR. There was a significant association between case volume and performance on the QE but not on the RE.\nOver the past 15 years, there has been a significant increase in the total number of operative cases reported to the VSB by both QE and RE applicants. Contrary to popular belief, the volume of major open vascular surgery reported by recent vascular surgery residents has remained relatively stable since 1994. Over the same time period, endovascular procedures have been rapidly incorporated into clinical practice by the majority of vascular surgeons applying for recertification by the VSB. Current vascular surgery residents receive a rich operative experience in both open and endovascular procedures that is reflective of contemporary practice.",

Because hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) expression also increases with mechanical stretch, this study tested whether upregulation of HIFs is an intermediary mechanism linking prolonged vein wall stretch to the changes in MMP expression and venous contraction.\nSegments of rat inferior vena cava (IVC) were suspended in tissue bath under 0.5-g basal tension for 1 hour, and a control contraction to phenylephrine (PHE, 10(-5)M) and KCl (96 mM) was elicited. The veins were then exposed to prolonged 18 hours of tension at 0.5 g, 2 g, 2 g plus HIF inhibitor U0126 (10(-5)M), 17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG, 10(-5)M), or echinomycin (10(-6)M), or 2 g plus dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG; 10(-4)M), a prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor that stabilizes HIF. The fold-change in PHE and KCl contraction was compared with the control contraction at 0.5-g tension for 1 hour. Vein tissue homogenates were analyzed for HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein amount using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blots.\nCompared with control IVC contraction at 0.5-g tension for 1 hour, the PHE and KCl contraction after prolonged 0.5-g tension was 2.0 \u00b1 0.35 and 1.1 \u00b1 0.06, respectively. Vein contraction to PHE and KCl after prolonged 2-g tension was significantly reduced (0.87 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.72 \u00b1 0.05, respectively). PHE-induced contraction was restored in IVC exposed to prolonged 2-g tension plus the HIF inhibitor U0126 (1.38 \u00b1 0.15) or echinomycin (1.99 \u00b1 0.40). U0126 and echinomycin also restored KCl-induced contraction in IVC exposed to prolonged 2-g tension (1.14 \u00b1 0.05 and 1.11 \u00b1 0.15, respectively). Treatment with DMOG further reduced PHE- and KCl-induced contraction in veins subjected to prolonged 2-g tension (0.47 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.57 \u00b1 0.01, respectively). HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA were overexpressed in IVC exposed to prolonged 2-g tension, and the overexpression was reversed by U0126. The overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 in stretched IVC was associated with increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA. The protein amount of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was also increased in IVC exposed to prolonged 2-g wall tension.\nProlonged increases in vein wall tension are associated with overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, and reduced venous contraction in rat IVC. Together with our report that MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibit IVC contraction, the data suggest that increased vein wall tension induces HIF overexpression and causes an increase in MMP expression and reduction of venous contraction, leading to progressive venous dilation and varicose vein formation.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery patients are at increased risk for late sudden cardiac death. Identification of patients at risk during surgery offers the opportunity for focused therapy.\nWe monitored 483 vascular surgery patients who had no documented history of arrhythmias to identify perioperative new-onset ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) and myocardial ischemia using a continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) device for 72 hours. Cardiac risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), medical therapy, inflammation status, and perioperative ischemia in relation to arrhythmia were noted in all patients. During follow-up, event-based outcomes analysis was used to describe survival.\nNew-onset perioperative VT was detected in 33 patients (6.8%). A higher percentage of patients experiencing perioperative VT had reduced LVEF preoperatively than those without VT (24% vs 12%; P = .04). Additionally, fewer patients experiencing VT were receiving statins than those without (70% vs 85%; P = .02). Patients experiencing VT had a higher incidence of myocardial ischemia (30% vs 18%; P = .10). Perioperative VT was preceded by ischemia in only 60% of the cases. The overall cohort survival was 83% at 24-month follow-up (interquartile range [IQR], 1.1-1.3). Sudden cardiac death free survival among patients experiencing VT was less than in those without (79% vs 92%; P = .02). After adjusting for gender, cardiac risk factors, and type of surgery, new-onset perioperative VT was associated with sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-5.8).\nPerioperative VT is likely to be associated with late sudden cardiac death and decreased survival. Continuous perioperative ECG is an effective method to identify VT and may allow improved management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of this study was to examine outcomes following open repair of extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) at a single university hospital. As a secondary aim, comparison was made to patients who underwent open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with supraceliac clamping but without left renal artery bypass to assess the effect of left renal artery bypass on outcomes.\nPatients undergoing open extent IV TAAA repair from 1998 to 2008 were identified (n = 108). Primary outcomes were 30-day and long-term survival. Secondary outcomes were major complication, renal failure, and postoperative change in renal function. A second analysis was performed, comparing patients undergoing extent IV TAAA repair with patients undergoing AAA repair with supraceliac clamping but without left renal artery bypass (n = 50).\nEighty-three men (76.9%) and 25 women (23.1%), with a mean age of 72.9 years, underwent open extent IV TAAA repair. Nine patients (8.3%) were ruptured. Mean aneurysm maximal diameter was 6.5 \u00b1 1.3 cm. Supraceliac and left renal ischemic times were 22.9 \u00b1 9.3 and 40.6 \u00b1 16.2 minutes, respectively. Six patients (5.6%) died at 30 days. The only predictor of 30-day mortality was decreased preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = .044 by multivariate analysis; and P = .011 by univariate analysis). One-year and 5-year survival rates were 87% and 50%, respectively. Patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease (P = .001) and postoperative renal insufficiency (P = .034) had increased long-term mortality by log-rank test. Twenty-five (25.3%) patients sustained a postoperative decrease in renal function, while 19 (19.2%) patients had an improvement in renal function. There was no difference in 30-day mortality (5.6% vs 6.0%; P = 1.000), 5-year survival (50% vs 48%; P = .886), major complications (37.0% vs 38.0%; P = 1.000), renal failure (6.1% vs 0%; P = .215), or postoperative change in renal function, in patients undergoing extent IV TAAA repair vs AAA repair with supraceliac clamping but without left renal artery bypass.\nOpen extent IV TAAA repair can be performed with low morbidity and mortality rates. The performance of left renal artery bypass does not appear to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of extent IV TAAA repair. While decreased preoperative eGFR appears to increase the risk of 30-day mortality, a history of cerebrovascular disease and postoperative renal insufficiency appear to increase the risk of long-term mortality. Finally, open extent IV TAAA repair not uncommonly improves renal function.",

    "abstract": "Proanthocyanidins are abundantly found in grape seeds and have been suggested to inhibit the pathogenesis of systemic diseases. We investigated the antithrombotic effects of proanthocyanidins in a rat model of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and examined the underlying mechanisms.\nDVT was induced in rat model by inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation. Grape seed proanthocyanidins extract (GSPE, 400 mg/kg/d) dissolved in saline (2 mL) was orally administered to the experimental rats. Control rats were administrated saline (2 mL) only. The thrombi were harvested and weighed. The IVC was analyzed histologically and by transmission electron microscopy. The cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) in thrombi was examined by Western blot.\nGSPE significantly reduced thrombus length and weight (P < .01) and protected the integrity of the endothelium. GSPE inhibited thrombogenesis-promoting factors P-selectin, von Willebrand factor, and CAMs, and promoted thrombogenesis-demoting factors CD34, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, and ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type one motif, member 13).

The antithrombotic properties of proanthocyanidins are likely to be directly associated with endothelial protection and regeneration, platelet aggregation, and inhibition of inflammatory cell and thrombus adhesion. Thus, proanthocyanidins may have a clinical application in DVT treatment.",

    "abstract": "Hospital quality in vascular surgery is often measured using mortality. We sought to determine whether adjusting mortality for statistical reliability changes hospital quality rankings for vascular surgery.\nPatients undergoing five common vascular surgery procedures (open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, lower extremity bypass, and aorto-femoral bypass) in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) in 2007 were identified (n = 14,559). For each hospital, we first calculated a ratio of observed to expected mortality (O-E ratio) using standard NSQIP techniques. We then adjusted these estimates for statistical noise using empirical Bayes methods, a technique known as reliability adjustment. We then compared rankings based on the standard O-E ratio to the rankings after reliability adjustment.\nA total of 172 hospitals reported an average adjusted mortality rate of 2.4% for the five procedures, varying from 0% to 17%. After adjusting for statistical noise using reliability adjustment, hospital mortality was greatly diminished, varying only from 1.7% to 4.1%. This adjustment for reliability had a dramatic effect on hospital rankings. Overall, 43% of hospitals were reclassified into either a higher or lower quartile of performance using traditional methods of risk-adjustment. Fifty-one percent all hospitals in the \"best\" quartile of performance according to traditional O-E ratios are not classified in the \"best\" quartile after adjusting for statistical noise. Twenty-six percent of hospitals in the \"worst\" quartile were no longer classified as such after adjusting for noise.\nAdjusting mortality for reliability reduces statistical noise and provides more stable estimates of hospital quality. Reliability adjustment should be standard for comparing hospital quality.",

    "abstract": "Since the end of the 20th century, robot-assisted surgery has been finding its role among other minimally invasive methods. Vascular surgery seems to be another specialty in which the benefits of this technology can be expected. Our objective was to assess the learning curve of robot-assisted laparoscopic aortofemoral bypass grafting for aortoiliac occlusive disease in a group of 40 patients.\nBetween May 2006 and January 2010, 40 patients (32 men, 8 women), who were a median age of 58 years (range, 48-75 years), underwent 40 robot-assisted laparoscopic aortofemoral reconstructions. Learning curve estimations were used for anastomosis, clamping, and operative time assessment. For conversion rate evaluation, the cumulative summation (CUSUM) technique was used. Statistical analysis comparing the first and second half of our group, and unilateral-to-bilateral reconstructions were performed.\nWe created 21 aortofemoral and 19 aortobifemoral bypasses. The median proximal anastomosis time was 23 minutes (range, 18-50 minutes), median clamping time was 60 minutes (range, 40-95 minutes), and median operative time was 295 minutes (range, 180-475 minutes). The 30-day mortality rate was 0%, and no graft or wound infection or cardiopulmonary or hepatorenal complications were observed. During the median 18-month follow-up (range, 2-48 months), three early graft occlusions occurred (7%). After reoperations, the secondary patency of reconstructions was 100%. Data showed a typical short learning curve for robotic proximal anastomosis creation with anastomosis and clamping time reduction. The operative time learning curve was flat, confirming the procedure's complexity. There were two conversions to open surgery. CUSUM analysis confirmed that an acceptable conversion rate set at 5% was achieved. Comparing the first and second half of our group, all recorded times showed statistically significant improvements. Differences between unilateral and bilateral reconstructions were not statistically significant.\nOur results show that the success rate of robot-assisted laparoscopic aortofemoral bypass grafting is high and the complication rate is low. Anastomosis creation, one of the main difficulties of laparoscopic bypass grafting, has been overcome using the robotic operating system and its learning curve is short. However, the endoscopic dissection of the aortoiliac segment remains the most difficult part of the operation and should be addressed in further development of the method to reduce the operative times. Long-term results and potential benefits of this minimally invasive method have to be verified by randomized controlled clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "This study compared, at a national level, trends in utilization, mortality, and stroke after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) from 2005 to 2007.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for patient discharges with International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for CAS and CEA. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, stroke, hospital charges, and discharge disposition. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate these outcomes by neurologic presentation using \u03c7(2) and multivariable logistic regression.\nOf the 404,256 discharges for carotid revascularization, CAS utilization was 66% higher in 2006 than in 2005 (9.3% vs 14%, P = .0004). Crude mortality, stroke, and median charges remained higher for CAS than for CEA; discharge to home was more common after CEA. Results improved from 2005 to 2007. By logistic regression of the total cohort from 2005 to 2006, CAS was independently predictive of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.00; P < .0001). Independent predictors of stroke included CAS (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18-1.73; P < .0001) and symptomatic disease (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.06-2.93;P < .0001). Among subgroups based on neurological presentation, regression showed that CAS significantly increased the odds of stroke in asymptomatic patients (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0; P = .0003). Among symptomatic patients, CAS increased the odds of in-hospital death (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.7-5.1, P < .0001) and trended toward significance for stroke (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.8; P = .0569).\nUtilization of CAS has increased from the years 2005 to 2007 with some improvements in the outcome.

    "abstract": "Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) who are surgical candidates have as many as three options: open surgery, endovascular surgery, or no surgery. As with all treatment decisions, informed patient preferences are critical. Decision support tools have the potential to better inform patients about the risks and benefits associated with each treatment option and to empower patients to participate meaningfully in the decision-making process. The objective of this study was to develop and pilot test a decision support tool for patients with AAAs.\nWe developed a personalized, interactive, computer-based decision support tool reflecting the most current outcomes data and input from surgeons and patients. We piloted the tool with AAA repair candidates who used the tool prior to meeting with their surgeon. Patients were recruited from a university-based vascular surgery clinic and affiliated VA hospital clinic. To determine feasibility and acceptability, the following outcomes were measured: (1) percent of patients who agreed to participate, (2) length of time required to use the tool, (3) the amount of assistance required to use the tool, and (4) patients' opinions on the acceptability of the tool. To assess effectiveness of the tool, we measured change in knowledge and decisional conflict pre- and post-tool using the paired t-test.\nOne hundred percent of patients who were approached (n = 12) agreed to participate in the study. The tool was administered in a median time of 35 minutes (range, 25-45 minutes), and all patients were able to navigate the program with minor technical assistance. Mean knowledge scores increased from 56% to 90% (P = .005), and decisional conflict scores decreased from 29% to 8% (P = .04). Overall, patients reported that the program content was balanced across treatment options, presented information clearly and concisely, helped them to organize their thoughts about the decision, and prepared them to talk to their surgeon about what mattered most to them.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that use of an evidence-based AAA decision support tool is feasible and acceptable to patients, increases knowledge, and decreases decisional conflict. Widespread use of such a tool might improve the content and quality of informed consent for this difficult treatment decision.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the population trends for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in the period 1970 to 2000 all indicated that the incidence of AAAs was increasing. It is not known whether this increase has continued. We hypothesized that the incidence of AAAs has begun to fall in Australia.\nAge-standardized national trends in mortality from AAAs were estimated for the period 1999 to 2006, and hospital separations (deaths or discharges) for AAAs were estimated for the period 1999 to 2008. Poisson regression models were constructed to estimate the relative change over time.\nThe age-standardized mortality rate from AAAs fell by an average of 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-7.3) per annum in men and 2.9% (95% CI, 1.0-4.7) in women. After adjusting for age, hospital separations for men decreased by an average of 2.3% (95% CI, 1.4-2.7) per annum for nonruptured AAAs, and 5.9% (95% CI, 5.0-6.6) for ruptured AAAs and for women decreased by an average of 2.2% (95% CI, 1.4-3.0) per annum for nonruptured AAAs, and 5.1% (95% CI, 3.7-6.5) for ruptured AAAs. Ruptured, compared with nonruptured, AAAs were proportionally more common in women compared with men. The age-specific trends in separations from hospital were all downward apart from nonruptured AAAs in individuals aged 80 years and over.\nThe rates of separation from hospital and mortality for AAAs in Australia have fallen since 1999. This suggests a true fall in incidence of AAAs. Although the reasons for this are unknown, it has implications for policy decisions about screening.",

Data were collected on a continuous basis from vascular registries and analyzed retrospectively.\nSeventeen patients (8 spine, 9 orthopedic operations) had iatrogenic arterial injuries manifest as thrombosis or laceration with bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula. The majority of arterial lacerations with bleeding and pseudoaneurysms were treated with open surgical repair while the majority of thromboses and arteriovenous fistulae were treated with endovascular techniques. Fasciotomy was necessary in three of seven patients with arterial complications of knee and hip operations. There was no mortality or limb loss. Significant morbidity in the form of foot drop (1), iliac vein thrombosis (2), delayed ambulation due to hematoma and swelling of the lower extremity (2), and ischemic myonecrosis of calf muscles (1) occurred. Two patients launched legal action.\nArterial injuries following orthopedic and spine operations can be successfully managed by both open and endovascular techniques. Significant morbidity and increased length of stay is common. Patient dissatisfaction with the complication and need for ensuing treatment can have significant medicolegal consequences.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), long-term follow-up studies reporting single-device results are scarce. In this study, we focus on EVAR repair with the Talent stent graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif).\nBetween July 2000 and December 2007, 365 patients underwent elective EVAR with a Talent device. Patient data were gathered prospectively and evaluated retrospectively. By American Society of Anesthesiologists category, 74% were categories III and IV. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed before discharge, at 3, 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Data are presented according to reporting standards for EVAR.\nThe mean proximal aortic neck diameter was 27 mm (range, 16-36 mm), with a neck length <15 mm in 31% (data available for 193 patients).

    "abstract": "There has been a longstanding debate about the roles of surgical bypass graft, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, subintimal angioplasty, and conservative management for femoro-popliteal occlusive disease. Subintimal angioplasty was first described in 1987 as a method of performing an endovascular arterial bypass. The subintimal space at the start of the occlusion is entered with a catheter and a wire loop is used to cross the occlusion and reenter the vessel lumen distally. In patients with critical limb ischemia, there is high quality evidence demonstrating that the limb salvage rate and amputation-free survival rates for surgery and endovascular treatment are similar, but surgery is more expensive than angioplasty in the short term. In patients with intermittent claudication, surgical bypass using an autologous saphenous vein graft is currently believed to be the gold standard, but this is increasingly questioned in the light of recent advances in endovascular techniques. Surgical bypass with vein graft offers a 2-year patency of 81%, compared with 67% for a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft and at best 67% for subintimal angioplasty. The better patency offered by surgery must be balanced against a higher morbidity and mortality. To conclude, subintimal angioplasty is an extremely valuable technique in the management of critical limb ischemia. Based on the evidence to date, this technique is likely to have an increasing role in the management of intermittent claudication over the coming years, particularly if the risk of general anaesthesia is high or there is no suitable vein.",

    "abstract": "Advanced age is a significant risk factor that has traditionally steered patients away from open aneurysm repair and toward expectant management. Today, however, the reduced morbidity and mortality of aortic stent grafting has created a new opportunity for aneurysm repair in patients previously considered too high a risk for open surgery. Here we report our experience with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in nonagenarians.\nRetrospective chart review identified all patients>90-years-old undergoing EVAR over a 9-year period at our institution. Collected data included preoperative comorbidities, perioperative complications, endoleaks, reinterventions, and long-term survival.\n24 patients underwent EVAR. The mean age was 91.5 years (range 90-94) among 15 (63%) males and 9 (37%) females. Mean abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter was 6.3\u00b11.1 cm. Eight patients (33%) were symptomatic (pain or tenderness). There were no ruptures. Fourteen patients (58%) had general anesthesia while 10 (42%) had local or regional anesthesia. Mean postoperative length of stay was 3.2\u00b12.4 days (2.8\u00b11.9 days for asymptomatic vs 4.1\u00b13.2 days for symptomatic, P=.29). There was one perioperative mortality (4.2%). There were two local groin seromas (8.3%) and six systemic complications (25%). One patient required reintervention for endoleak (4.2%). There were no aneurysm related deaths beyond the 30-day postoperative period. Mean survival beyond 30 days was 29.7\u00b118.0 months for patients expiring during follow-up. Cumulative estimated 12, 24, and 36-month survival rates were 83%, 64%, and 50%, respectively. Linear regression analysis demonstrated an inverse relationship between the number of preoperative comorbidities and postoperative survival in our cohort (R2=0.701), with significantly decreased survival noted for patients presenting with >5 comorbidities. Those still alive in follow-up have a mean survival of 36.1\u00b116.0 months.\nThis is the largest reported EVAR series in nonagenarians. Despite their advanced age, these patients benefit from EVAR with low morbidity, low mortality, and mean survival exceeding 2.4 years. Survival appears best in those patients with \u22645 comorbidities. With or without symptoms, patients over the age of 90 should be considered for EVAR.",

In these, four extremities had venous ulceration involving the forefoot. Specifically, the superficial venous arch near the metatarsal heads, the foot portion of the great and small saphenous veins, the anterior arch veins on the foot dorsum, and the plantar veins were interrogated with a 12-MHz probe.\nReflux was found in 32% of pedal vein segments in CEAP C5, C6 legs, with ulceration involving only the gaiter area (mean number of incompetent foot segments, 1.6 \u00b1 1.2). Pedal reflux was present in 65% of foot vein segments when forefoot ulceration was present (mean number of incompetent foot segments, 3.3 \u00b1 1.3). Student t-test for the difference in the mean number of incompetent foot vein segments was significant (P < .004).\nVenous ulceration can affect the forefoot and toe areas and is associated with reflux in the pedal vein segments.",

    "abstract": "Approval of the primary certificate in vascular surgery eliminated the requirement for certification in general surgery before vascular surgery certification. New training paradigms for training in vascular surgery have emerged driven by the desire to offer greater flexibility of training and to shorten the length of training. Many of these changes are based upon \"expert opinion,\" promise, and \"logic\" without objective evaluation of the residents or the training programs themselves. To be on the forefront of surgical education, vascular surgery will need to adopt methods of curriculum development firmly grounded in educational principles and use modern assessment tools for the evaluation of competence and performance. This report presents the evolution and challenges to the current vascular surgical training model and then argues for a more rigorous and scientific approach to training in vascular surgery. It presents an analysis of potential avenues for placing education and training in vascular surgery on the forefront of modern surgical education.",

    "abstract": "Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are a significant health problem that afflicts 1% of the population at some point during their lifetime. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is widely used to prevent deep venous thrombosis. However, IPC seems to have application to a broader base of circulatory diseases. The intermittent nature of pulsatile external compression produces beneficial physiologic changes, which include hematologic, hemodynamic, and endothelial effects, which should promote healing of VLUs. Clinical studies of the management of VLUs show that IPC increases overall healing and accelerates the rate of healing, leading to current guideline recommendations for care of patients with VLUs. Proper prescription of IPC to improve the management of patients with VLUs requires further definition. It seems that application of IPC in combination with sustained graduated compression improves outcome in patients with the most advanced venous disease.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative limb compression is widely used after venous surgery to prevent thromboembolism and to reduce hemorrhage, edema, hematoma, and pain. Only limited studies have been published regarding the most adequate postoperative compression therapy after varicose vein surgery. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a new stocking kit used for postoperative limb compression.\nThe study compared the clinical practicability, ease to use, effectiveness, and safety of a postoperative stocking system (23 to 32 mmHg at the ankle) with compression bandages (control group). This prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial, was performed in three Italian centers specializing in venous surgery. Sixty consecutive patients (classification CEAP C\u2082,(S)) underwent unilateral varicose vein surgery at one of the three centers. After surgery, patients were randomized for postoperative compression therapy with a new stocking system (Sigvaris Postoperative Kit; Ganzoni Sigvaris Corp, Winterthur, Switzerland) or standard stretch bandages (30 patients per group). Primary end points were incidence of venous thromboembolism, hemorrhage, limb hematoma, or edema.\nNo episodes of venous thromboembolism were observed. The mean area of thigh hematoma on postoperative days 7 and 14 was 75.70 cm\u00b2 and 2.93 cm\u00b2, respectively, for the stocking group, and 92.97 cm\u00b2 and 5.42 cm\u00b2 for the bandage group (not significant). On postoperative day 7, edema was found in 50% of the patients wearing bandages and in 20% of the patients wearing the stocking kit, which was a significant reduction. No statistical difference was recorded for postoperative pain; however, better patient acceptance and quality of life after the operation were recorded in the stocking group.\nPatients can be effectively treated with the Sigvaris Postoperative Kit. Patients treated with stockings have less edema compared with standard bandaging, and the application of the stocking kit improves patient quality of life and compliance with postoperative compression therapy.",

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) of the lower extremities remains a challenging clinical dilemma. Treatment of ALI has shifted toward endovascular therapies. The purpose of this study was to assess outcomes in patients treated for ALI with intra-arterial thrombolysis and/or adjuvant endovascular techniques.\nConsecutive patients with ALI of the lower extremities treated via endovascular intra-arterial methods between January 1, 2005 and September 30, 2007 were identified and reviewed. Comparisons of success, thrombolysis days, and all 30-day outcomes except mortality were performed using generalized estimating equations with logistic and proportional odds regression. Thirty-day mortality was assessed using logistic regression. Long-term patency, limb salvage, and survival were assessed using time-to-event methods, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards models.\nThe analyzed dataset included 129 limbs treated in 119 patients presenting with ALI (class I 68%, class IIa 23%, class IIb 9%). The mean follow-up was 16.8 months (range: 0-43 months). Technical success was achieved in 82% cases. The 30-day mortality rate was 6.0% with all 30-day deaths occurring in females (P = .002). One (0.76%) central nervous system hemorrhage (CNS) was noted in this cohort. Primary patency for the entire cohort at 12 and 24 months was 50.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.5-60.7) and 37.7% (95% CI, 26.2-49.1), respectively, while secondary patency was 74.0% (95% CI, 64.9-83.1) and 65.3% (95% CI, 54.5-76.2). Multivariable analyses identified patients presenting with femoropopliteal (hazard ratio [HR] 2.63) or tibial thrombosis (HR 2.80); graft thrombosis (vs native artery thrombosis, HR 2.57) and long-term dialysis (HR 3.66, 95% CI, 2.35-5.71, P < .001) were associated with poorer primary patency rates. Cumulative limb salvage at 24 months was 68.8% (95% CI: 59.5-78.1) with female gender (HR 3.34, P = .002) and thrombolysis \u2265 3 days (HR 2.35, P = .019) associated with an increased risk of limb loss. Overall 36-month survival was 84.5% (95% CI: 77.5-91.6). Women had decreased survival rates both in the short- and midterm (HR 6.29; 95% CI, 1.78-22.28; P = .004).\nEndovascular therapy with thrombolysis remains an effective treatment option for patients presenting with lower extremity ALI. Thrombolysis should be limited to <3 days. Female gender negatively affects the rates of limb salvage and survival.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in diabetic patients in a large single-center experience.\nOver a 13-year period ending in December 2008, 4305 consecutive CEAs in 3573 patients were performed. All patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database. Interventions were performed in diabetic patients in 883 cases (20.5%; group 1) and in nondiabetics in the remaining 3422 (79.5%; group 2). Early results in terms of 30-day stroke and death rates were analyzed and compared. Follow-up results were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with log-rank test.\nDiabetic patients were more likely to be females and to have coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, hyperlipemia, and arterial hypertension than nondiabetics. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of preoperative clinical status or degree of carotid stenosis. Interventions were performed under general anesthesia with somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) monitoring in 67% of the patients in both groups, while the remaining interventions were performed under clinical monitoring. Shunt insertion (14% and 11%, respectively) and patch closure rates (79% and 76%, respectively) were similar between the two groups. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of neurological outcomes, while the mortality rate was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P = .002; odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-8.3); combined 30-day stroke and death rate was significantly higher in group 1 (2%) than in group 2 (0.9%; P = .006; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9; OR, 2.2). At univariate analysis, perioperative risk of stroke and death in diabetic patients was significantly higher in patients undergoing intervention with SEP cerebral monitoring (95% CI, 0.9-39.9; OR, 5.9; P = .01), and this was also confirmed by multivariate analysis (95% CI, 1.1-23.1; OR, 8.3; P = .04). The same analysis in nondiabetics demonstrated that again the need for general anesthesia significantly increased perioperative risk, but this was not significant at multivariate analysis. Follow-up was available in 96% of patients, with a mean duration of 40 months (range, 1-166 months). There were no differences between the two groups in terms of estimated 7-year survival (87.3% and 88.8%, respectively; 95% CI, 0.57-1.08; OR, 0.8) and stroke-free survival (86.8% and 88.1%, respectively; 95% CI, 0.59-1.07; OR, 0.8). Diabetic patients had decreased severe (>70%) restenosis-free survival rates at 7 years than nondiabetics (77.4% and 82.2%, respectively; 95% CI, 0.6-1; OR, 0.8; P = .05). Univariate analysis demonstrated again that the use of instrumental cerebral monitoring significantly decreased stroke-free survival in diabetics (P = .01; log rank, 10.1), and this was also confirmed by multivariate analysis (95% CI, 1.7-17.7; OR, 5.4; P = .005).\nIn our experience, the presence of diabetes mellitus increases three-fold the risk of perioperative death after CEA, while there are no differences with nondiabetics in terms of perioperative stroke. However, the rate of stroke and death at 30 days still remains below the recommended standards. During follow-up, this difference becomes negligible, and results are fairly similar to those obtained in nondiabetics. Particular attention should be paid to patients undergoing intervention under general anesthesia, who seem to represent a subgroup of diabetics at higher perioperative risk, suggesting neurologic monitoring should be used when possible.",

There were no differences between the two groups in terms of preoperative clinical status or degree of carotid stenosis.

Shunt insertion (14% and 11%, respectively) and patch closure rates (79% and 76%, respectively) were similar between the two groups. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of neurological outcomes, while the mortality rate was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P = .002; odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-8.3); combined 30-day stroke and death rate was significantly higher in group 1 (2%) than in group 2 (0.9%; P = .006; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9; OR, 2.2). At univariate analysis, perioperative risk of stroke and death in diabetic patients was significantly higher in patients undergoing intervention with SEP cerebral monitoring (95% CI, 0.9-39.9; OR, 5.9; P = .01), and this was also confirmed by multivariate analysis (95% CI, 1.1-23.1; OR, 8.3; P = .04). The same analysis in nondiabetics demonstrated that again the need for general anesthesia significantly increased perioperative risk, but this was not significant at multivariate analysis. Follow-up was available in 96% of patients, with a mean duration of 40 months (range, 1-166 months).

Spontaneous recanalization of the extracranial portion of the ICA occlusion of atherosclerotic or embolic origin is only anecdotally reported, and data are lacking about its incidence, natural history, and outcome in long-term follow-up.\nConsecutive patients with ICA occlusion were prospectively identified and followed-up to detect the incidence of a spontaneous recanalization. Patients with objectively confirmed recanalization were prospectively followed-up to observe their natural history and the onset of new cerebrovascular events. ICA occlusion and spontaneous recanalization were diagnosed by means of color-coded Doppler ultrasound imaging or selective contrast angiography, or both. All patients were evaluated and treated for atherosclerotic risk factors.\nSpontaneous recanalization occurred in 16 of 696 patients (2.3%; 95% confidence interval, 1.3%-3.7%) with ICA occlusion after a mean interval of 38 months from the diagnosis of occlusion. Spontaneous recanalization was detected with color-coded Doppler ultrasound imaging and with selective contrast angiography, with a complete agreement of diagnostic findings. Two patients presented with symptomatic spontaneous recanalization. All patients with spontaneous recanalization were asymptomatic after a mean follow-up of 66.2 months.\nSpontaneous recanalization of previously occluded extracranial ICAs is more frequent than anticipated.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated early and long-term results of endovascular treatment of iliac artery occlusions and compared these outcomes with those in patients treated for stenotic lesions.\nDuring a 10-year period ending in January 2010, 223 endovascular procedures to treat aortoiliac occlusive disease (PAD) were performed. All patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database. The intervention was performed for iliac occlusion in 109 patients (group 1) and for iliac stenosis in 114 (group 2). Early results were analyzed and compared by \u03c7\u00b2 and Fisher exact tests. Follow-up consisted of clinical examination and duplex scanning at discharge, \u2264 3 months, at 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Follow-up results were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the log-rank test.\nThe two groups had similar risk factors for atherosclerosis and comorbidities. Critical limb ischemia was more common in group 1 (20.5%) than in group 2 (8.5%; P = .01). Intraoperative technical details were similar, except for a higher percentage of brachial and contralateral femoral access and more frequent use of nitinol stents in group 1. Two immediate technical failures occurred, one in both groups, requiring immediate conversion to surgical bypass. Four intraoperative iliac ruptures occurred, two in each group; all were successfully treated with covered stents. An additional 10 immediate complications occurred (8 in group 1; 2 in group 2), one of which required conversion to open surgical bypass. The cumulative rate of perioperative complications was 9% in group 1 and 3.5% in group 2 (P = .08). Primary patency at 30 days was 97.3% and 98.7%, respectively. Mean duration of follow-up was 28.4 months; 203 patients (91%) had a regular postoperative follow-up visit. At 60 months, primary patency in group 1 vs group 2 was 82.4% vs 77.7% (P = .9), assisted primary patency was 90.6% vs 85.5% (P = .4), and estimated secondary patency was 93.1% vs 92.8% (P = .3). The cumulative rate of reintervention during follow-up (excluding reinterventions performed in the perioperative period) was 2.5% in group 1 and 12.5% in group 2 at 60 months (P = .09). Univariate analysis in group 1 failed to find any of the examined risk factors significantly affected long-term primary patency rates.\nIn our experience, endovascular treatment of iliac occlusions provides excellent early and long-term results, similar to those obtained in the treatment of stenotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "In response to the need for a disease severity measurement, the American Venous Forum committee on outcomes assessment developed the Venous Severity Scoring system in 2000. There are three components of this scoring system, the Venous Disability Score, the Venous Segmental Disease Score, and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). The VCSS was developed from elements of the CEAP classification (clinical grade, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology), which is the worldwide standard for describing the clinical features of chronic venous disease. However, as a descriptive instrument, the CEAP classification responds poorly to change. The VCSS was subsequently developed as an evaluative instrument that would be responsive to changes in disease severity over time and in response to treatment. Based on initial experiences with the VCSS, an international ad hoc working group of the American Venous Forum was charged with updating the instrument. This revision of the VCSS is focused on clarifying ambiguities, updating terminology, and simplifying application. The specific language of proven quality-of-life instruments was used to better address the issues of patients at the lower end of the venous disease spectrum. Periodic review and revision are necessary for generating more universal applicability and for comparing treatment outcomes in a meaningful way.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) for ablation of the great saphenous vein (GSV) is thought to minimize postoperative morbidity compared with high ligation and stripping (HL/S). Only a few randomized trials have reported early results. This prospective randomized trial compared EVLT (980 nm) and HL/S results at 1 and 2 years after the intervention.\nPatients with symptomatic varicose veins due to GSV insufficiency were randomized to HL/S (100 limbs) or EVLT (104 limbs). Four EVLT procedures failed primarily and were excluded. Phlebectomy and ligature of incompetent perforators were performed whenever indicated in both groups.

Closure rate, complication rate, time to return to normal activity, the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score (AVVSS), the Varicose Venous Clinical Severity Score (VVCSS), and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 scores were also recorded.\nThere were no differences in patient demographics, CEAP class, Widmer class, or severity scores between the groups. Simultaneous interventions did not differ between the groups. Similar times for the return to normal activity and scores for postoperative pain were reported. No major complications after treatment were recorded. HL/S limbs had significantly more postoperative hematomas than EVLT limbs, and EVLT patients reported more bruising. Follow-up at 1 year was 100% for HL/S and 99% for EVLT. Two GSVs in the EVLT group reopened and three partially reopened. No open GSVs occurred in HL/S limbs. Ninety-eight percent of the limbs in both groups were free of symptoms. VCSS, AVVSS, and Short Form-36 scores did not reveal any group differences. At 2 years, no differences compared with 1-year results were observed, except that two more GSVs in the EVLT group were partially reopened.\nAbolition of GSV reflux and improvement in quality of life was similar after HL/S and EVLT. After EVLT, however, two GSVs were found completely reopened and five were partially reopened, which was significantly higher than after HL/S. A prolonged follow-up is ongoing.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of once-daily enoxaparin plus warfarin for the outpatient ambulatory treatment of lower-limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT).\nA total of 246 patients, comprising 128 men (mean age, 54.28\u00b116.48 years) and 118 women (mean age, 50.11\u00b116.47 years) with symptomatic lower extremity DVT, were included in this open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase IV clinical trial conducted at 14 centers in Turkey. All patients were administered subcutaneous enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg, once-daily) until international normalized ratio (INR) levels reached to 2 to 3, followed by oral warfarin (5 mg/d) for at least 3 months and elastic compression stockings (30-40 mm Hg). Clinical signs (leg circumference), symptoms (edema, pain, tenderness), recanalization rates upon duplex ultrasound examination, laboratory findings (D-dimer and INR levels), and postthrombotic syndrome status with CEAP classification were the efficacy parameters evaluated every 3 months during 18 months of follow-up. Safety end points included minor and major bleeding as well as serious adverse events.\nAmbulatory treatment with enoxaparin plus warfarin significantly reduced physical symptoms, including tenderness, edema, pain (P<.001), and the circumference of the affected leg (P<.001). The leg circumference difference in almost all patients was <1.5 cm at the end of 18 months (P<.001). Recanalization rates for occluded iliofemoral vein were 76.1% at 3 months and 86.5% at 18 months (P<.001). An early and significant decrease obtained in D-dimer levels on day 10 continued to decline significantly until month 6 and remained unchanged afterwards (P<.001). Of four patients diagnosed with major bleeding during oral anticoagulant use, three recovered with conservative treatment (reduction in hemoglobin levels in 2 developed at visit 2 [day 10] and intracranial bleeding in 1 developed at visit 3 [day 30]), and one patient required a hysterectomy after menorrhagia developed at visit 7 (month 18). Two of the 65 (9.9%) adverse events documented were serious adverse events, but none of the serious adverse events leading to death were related to the study medications.\nAmbulatory treatment with enoxaparin plus warfarin seems to be effective in symptomatic healing and in clinical improvement by reducing thrombus formation and organization at all levels of lower extremity venous system with DVT, without a significant major bleeding risk. Therefore, the results of our conventional conservative treatment are in line with 1A level evidence reported in the recent American College of Chest Physicians guideline.",

    "abstract": "To examine and report surgical results from a contemporary experience of open abdominal aortic reconstruction in patients with chronic atherosclerotic abdominal aortic occlusion (CAAAO).\nBetween January 1999 through May 2010, 54 patients with CAAAO were identified and retrospectively reviewed. CAAAOs were categorized into infrarenal aortic occlusions (IRAOs) and juxtarenal aortic occlusions (JRAOs) based on superior extension of thrombus and requirement for supra-renal aortic clamping to repair. Morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, and operative variables were assessed. The \u03c72 or Fisher test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare demographic and operative variables between two aortic occlusion groups (IRAO and JRAO). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess factors associated with surgical outcomes and hospital stay. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival and patency rates.\nFifty patients underwent aortic reconstructions with aorto-bifemoral or iliac bypass, and three underwent a remote axillo-femoral bypass procedure. There were 35 (64.8%) males, and 19 (35.2%) females. Median age was 51.9 years (range, 32-72 years). Of the two CAAAO groups, there were 20 IRAOs and 33 JRAOs. Aorto-renal thromboendartectomy was performed in 26 (49.1%) patients; 26 (75.8%) among JRAOs versus 1 (5%) of IRAOs (P<.01). Proximal aortic clamps were required in 28 (85%) of JRAOs and 3 (15%) of IRAOs (P<.01). Thirty-day and in-hospital mortality was zero. Median length of hospital stay was 7 days (range, 4 to 66 days), and median intensive care unit length of stay was 3 days (range, 1-22 days). Complications included cardiopulmonary dysfunction in four (8%), postoperative renal insufficiency in 10 (18.9%), and other postoperative complications in 15 (28.3%). All 10 with renal insufficiency recovered renal function to baseline creatinine or a creatinine value<1.1 mg/dL. Mean increases in right and left ankle-brachial indicess were 0.54\u00b10.25 and 0.59\u00b10.22, respectively. On univariate analysis, coronary artery disease and African American race were predictors of postoperative complications (P=.048). Age was significantly associated with total complications. Patients with postoperative complications and/or renal insufficiency were older than those without such complications (P=.02) Independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay were intraoperative blood replacement (P=.003), postoperative complications (P<.01), and postoperative renal insufficiency (P<.01). Prolonged intensive care unit stay was predicted by JRAO (P=.04), postoperative complications (P=.02), and postoperative renal insufficiency (P=.013). Survival at 3, 5, and 7 years were 86.6%, 76.5% and 50.9%, respectively. The reduced survival rates were predicted by previous myocardial infarction and existing coronary artery disease (P<.01).\nAbdominal aortic reconstruction is a safe method for treating CAAAO with low associated morbidity and mortality. Aorto-renal thromboendartectomy with supra-renal aortic clamping and aortic replacement remains an effective treatment for those with significant pararenal aortic disease, and can be performed without significant renal impairment.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid techniques using extra-anatomic bypass of critical aortic branches to enable endovascular treatment of complex aortic pathology have been previously described. A staged endograft repair of a complex, chronic Stanford type B aortic dissection with aneurysmal degeneration is reported in a 50-year-old man. The aneurysmal portion of the dissection extended from the distal arch to both common iliac arteries and was covered with an endograft from the ascending aorta to both external iliac arteries. Aortic arch branches, visceral, and renal arteries were bypassed using open technique. The patient had no neurologic complications. This case report illustrates the feasibility of the hybrid technique in selected high-risk patients when confronted with complex aortic pathology.",

    "abstract": "Estimation of the risk of adverse long-term outcome is of paramount importance in the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nWe evaluated the accuracy of two specific risk score systems, the Finnvasc score and the modified Prevent III (mPIII) score, in 1425 CLI patients who underwent unilateral, infrainguinal surgical (47.6%) or endovascular (52.4%) revascularization. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the predictive value of these risk scoring methods.\nThe area under the ROC curve of Finnvasc score for prediction of 30-day amputation was 0.609 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.549-0.677) and of mPIII score 0.533 (95% CI 0.457-0.609). The area under ROC curve of Finnvasc score for prediction of 30-day amputation-free survival was 0.622 (95% CI 0.573-0.671) and of mPIII score 0.588 (95% CI 0.533-0.642). The area under the ROC curve of Finnvasc score for prediction of 1-year amputation-free survival was 0.630 (95% CI 0.597-0.663, P<.0001) and of mPIII score 0.634 (95% CI 0.600-0.667, P<.0001). Finnvasc score predicted leg salvage (relative risk [RR] 1.431, 95% CI 1.319-1.551), survival (RR 1.233, 95% CI 1.116-1.363), and amputation-free survival (RR 1.422, 95% CI 1.319-1.534). mPIII score also predicted leg salvage (RR 1.190, 95% CI 1.108-1.277), survival (RR 1.245, 95% CI 1.193-1.300), and amputation-free survival (RR 1.223, 95% CI 1.176-1.272).\nFinnvasc and modified PIII risk scoring methods predict long-term outcome of patients undergoing infrainguinal revascularization for CLI. Finnvasc score seems to perform well also in predicting immediate postoperative outcome.",

    "abstract": "Successful thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) requires adequate proximal and distal fixation and seal. We report our experience of planned celiac artery coverage during endovascular repair of complex thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA).\nSince 2004, 228 patients underwent TEVAR under elective (n=162, 71%) and emergent circumstances (66, 29%). Patients with inadequate distal stent grafts landing zones during TEVAR underwent detailed evaluation of the gastroduodenal arcade with communicating collaterals between the celiac and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) by computed tomography angiography and intraoperative arteriogram. If needed, in presence of a patent SMA and demonstration of collaterals to the celiac artery, the stent grafts were extended to the SMA with celiac artery coverage. Furthermore, instances when further lengthening of distal thoracic stent graft landing zone was needed to obtain an adequate seal, the SMA was partially covered with the endograft, and a balloon expandable stent was routinely deployed in proximal SMA to maintain patency. Outcome data were prospectively collected and analyzed retrospectively.\nThirty-one of 228 (14%) patients with TEVAR required celiac artery interruption; 24 (77%) had demonstrable collaterals to the SMA. Twelve (39%) of 31 patients underwent additional partial SMA coverage by stent graft, and proximal SMA stent. The majority of patients were females (n=20, 65%), the mean age was 74 years (range 55-87 years), and the mean TAA size was 6.5 cm. Postoperative complications included visceral ischemia in 2 (6%) patients, paraplegia in 2 (6%) patients, and death in 2 (6%) patients. All type 1b endoleaks (n=2, 6%) and type 2 endoleaks vial retrograde flow from the celiac artery (n=3, 10%) were successfully treated by transfemoral coil embolization. Over a mean follow-up of 15 months, there have been no other complications of mesenteric ischemia, spinal cord ischemia, SMA in-stent stenosis, or conversion to open surgical repair.\nOur findings suggest that celiac artery coverage to facilitate adequate distal sealing during TEVAR with complex TAA is relatively safe in the presence of SMA-celiac collaterals. Pre-existing SMA stenosis can be successfully treated by balloon expandable stents during TEVAR, and endoleaks arising from distal stent grafts attachment site or via retrograde flow from the celiac artery can be successfully managed by transfemoral coil embolization. Although early results are encouraging, long-term efficacy of these procedures remains to be determined and vigilant follow-up is needed.",

    "abstract": "The first-line intervention for intermittent claudication is usually supervised exercise therapy (SET). The literature describes a range of exercise programs varying in setting, duration, and content. The purpose of the present study was to examine the exercise protocols offered and to identify the impact of the intensity of the SET programs (in terms of frequency, duration, and type of exercise) on improvements in walking distance (response) in the first 3 months. The present study is part of the Exercise Therapy in Peripheral Arterial Disease (EXITPAD) study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of SET provided by regional physiotherapists, with or without daily feedback, on the level of activities with the effects of walking advice.\nThe analysis included patients randomized to receive SET with or without feedback. The physical therapists administering the SET were asked to fill out therapy evaluation sheets stating frequency, duration, and type of exercises. The relationship between training volume and the impact on walking distance was explored by dividing training volume data into tertiles and relating them to the median change in maximum walking distance at 3 and 12 months.\nData of 169 patients were included in the analysis. A SET program consisting of at least two training sessions per week each lasting over 30 minutes, during the first 3 months of a 1-year program tailored to individual patients' needs led to better results in terms of walking distance after 3 and 12 months than the other variants. The results of our analysis dividing training volume into tertiles suggest that there is a relationship between training volume and improvement in walking distance and that at least 590 minutes of training should be offered in the first 3 months. No differences were found between program involving only walking and a combination of exercises, nor between individual and group training.\nA SET programs consisting of at least two training sessions a week, each lasting over 30 minutes, should be offered during the first 3 months of the SET program to optimize improvement in terms of maximum walking distance.",

    "abstract": "Mapping of venous reflux routes associated with medially or laterally located venous leg ulcers and their source of origin.\nThis prospective report presents the results of duplex investigations performed in consecutive leg ulcer patients, all with venous reflux, in a time period over 2 years. A total of 169 patients (183 legs), with chronic venous leg ulcers (CEAP: C6) were examined in a private practice. The data collection integrated an examination that included medical history and clinical diagnoses and incorporated measurements such as body mass index, oscillometric index, and range of motion of the ankle joint. Venous function was assessed with duplex ultrasound, and the cases were described using the advanced CEAP classification. Additionally, a \"sourcing\" technique was performed with duplex ultrasound investigation of the ulcer bed and the venous system under manual compression and release of the ulcer. The principle of \"sourcing\" is to follow venous reflux from the ulcer area to its proximal origin. The detected reflux routes were classified either as \"axial\" or \"crossover\" type.\nA total of 20% of the ulcer patients showed no clinically visible varicose veins. One hundred three patients had medial ulcers, 54 lateral ulcers, 21 medial and lateral, and five had gaiter ulcers. Sixty-four (35%) of the medially located ulcers had reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV), 28 (15%) showed reflux in the medial perforating veins (axial types), and 11 (6%) had reflux in the small saphenous vein (SSV; crossover type). From 54 patients presenting with lateral ulcers, 25 (14%) showed GSV incompetence (crossover type) and only 13 (7%) SSV incompetence (axial type). Sixteen patients showed refluxes penetrating from deep into lateral perforating veins.\nCrossover reflux routes were detected in 25 of 54 (46%) legs with lateral and in 11 of 103 (11%) legs with medial ulceration (\u03c72 44.34; P<.001). In venous ulcer patients, an extended examination (CEAP classification) and a special duplex technique (\"sourcing\") are recommended to identify the specific route responsible for the venous reflux. This seems essential for planning a rational treatment of venous reflux ulcers.",

Expression of LOX-1 is involved in the pathobiological effects of oxLDL in endothelial cells, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and leukocytic adhesion. Moderate consumption of phenolic-enriched food may have a protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis via the antioxidant capacity of phenolic compounds at the endothelial level. In this study, we determined whether ellagic acid, a polyphenolic compound widely distributed in fruits and nuts, protects against oxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction by modulating the LOX-1-mediated signaling pathway.\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with ellagic acid at doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 \u03bcM for 2 hours and then incubated with oxLDL (150 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 24 hours.\nLOX-1 protein expression was markedly lower after exposure to oxLDL in HUVECs pretreated with ellagic acid or diphenyleneiodonium, a well-known inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, than in HUVECs exposed to oxLDL alone, suggesting that ellagic acid deactivates NADPH oxidase. We also found that oxLDL activated the membrane assembly of p47phox, Rac1, gp91 and p22phox, and the subsequent induction of ROS generation; however, ROS generation was markedly suppressed in cells pretreated with ellagic acid or anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody. In addition, oxLDL down-regulated eNOS and up-regulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS), thereby augmenting the formation of NO and protein nitrosylation. Furthermore, oxLDL induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, activated the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules interleukin-(IL) 6 and IL-8 and the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin, and stimulated the adherence of THP-1 (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) to HUVECs. Pretreatment with ellagic acid, however, exerted significant cytoprotective effects in all events.\nFindings from this study may provide insight into a possible molecular mechanism by which ellagic acid inhibits LOX-1-induced endothelial dysfunction. Our data indicate that ellagic acid exerts its protective effects by inhibiting NADPH oxidase-induced overproduction of superoxide, suppressing the release of NO by down-regulating iNOS, enhancing cellular antioxidant defenses, and attenuating oxLDL-induced LOX-1 up-regulation and eNOS down-regulation.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been advocated as an alternative to redo surgery for patients with post-carotid endarterectomy (CEA) stenosis. This study compares early and late clinical outcomes for both groups.\nThis study analyzes 192 patients: 72 had reoperation (Group A) and 120 had CAS for post-CEA stenosis (Group B). Patients were followed prospectively and had duplex ultrasounds at 1 month, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. The perioperative complications (perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction/death, cranial nerve injury) and 4-year end points were analyzed. A Kaplan-Meier lifetable analysis was used to estimate rates of freedom from stroke, stroke-free survival, \u226550% restenosis, and \u226580% restenosis.\nDemographic/clinical characteristics were comparable for both groups, except for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, which were significantly higher in Group B. The indications for reoperations were transient ischemic attacks/stroke in 72% for Group A versus 57% for Group B (P=.0328). The mean follow-up was 33 months (range, 1-86 months) for Group A and 24 months (range, 1-78 months) for Group B (P=.0026). The proportion of early (<24 months) carotid restenosis prior to intervention was 51% in Group A versus 27% in Group B (P=.0013). The perioperative stroke rates were 3% and 1%, respectively (P=.5573). There were no myocardial infarctions or deaths in either group. The overall incidence of cranial nerve injury was 14% for Group A versus 0% for Group B (P<.0001). However, there was no statistical difference between the groups relating to permanent cranial nerve injury (1% versus 0%). The combined early and late stroke rates for Groups A and B were 3% and 2%, respectively (P=.6347). The stroke-free rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for Groups A and B were 97%, 97%, 97%, and 97% and 98%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively (P=.6490). The stroke-free survival rates were not significantly different. The rates of freedom from \u226550% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 98%, 95%, 95%, and 95% for Group A versus 95%, 89%, 80%, and 72% for Group B (P=.0175). The freedom from \u226580% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for Groups A and B were 98%, 97%, 97%, and 97% versus 99%, 96%, 92%, and 87%, respectively (P=.2281). Four patients (one symptomatic) in Group B had reintervention for \u226580% restenosis. The rate of freedom from reintervention for Groups A and B were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% versus 94%, 89%, 83%, and 79%, respectively (P=.0634).\nCAS is as safe as redo CEA. Redo CEA has a higher incidence of transient cranial nerve injury; however, CAS has a higher incidence of \u226550% in-stent restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma (SRH) associated with iliac vein rupture is a rare but life-threatening emergency with high operative mortality. This study summarizes our experience in providing diagnostic and therapeutic management for this rare clinical entity.\nBetween May 2002 and May 2009, nine patients were admitted to our hospital for SRH and acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Medical data for demographics, clinical presentation, auxiliary examinations, treatment modalities, outcomes, and follow-up were retrospectively analyzed.\nNine patients (8 women, 1 man) were enrolled in this study. All were aged>45 years (range, 46-70 years). The common clinical manifestations were sudden onset of left lower abdominal or lumbar pain, swelling of the left lower extremity, anemia, and hypotension. Most patients were diagnosed by duplex ultrasound imaging and computed tomography scan. Three patients were treated conservatively, and six underwent surgical or combined treatments, comprising 2 repairs of iliac vein, 1 iliac vein ligation and Palma-Dale bypass graft, 1 pelvic vein ligation, 1 removal of hematoma, and 1 repair of iliac vein, thrombectomy, and endovascular stent placement. The iliac vein ruptured in five patients. May-Thurner syndrome was found in three patients. One patient died after surgery (operative mortality, 16.7%). Postoperative morbidity was 50%. Mean volume of perioperative blood transfusion was 900\u00b1640 mL (range, 0-2000 mL). Mean lengths of stay were 2.7\u00b11.4 days (range, 2-5 days) in the intensive care unit and 16.9\u00b12.4 days (range, 14-21 days) in the hospital. Eight patients were postoperatively treated with 6 months of warfarin. Mean follow-up was 30.5\u00b115.0 months (range, 6-50 months). The occurrence rate of chronic venous insufficiency was 87.5% during follow-up.\nSRH with concomitant DVT, especially in women aged >45, should be considered in patients with sudden lower abdominal or lumbar pain, leg swelling, anemia, and shock. Spontaneous iliac vein rupture and the presence of May-Thurner syndrome should be considered in these patients. Surgical interventions were associated with high mortality and morbidity. In our experience, conservative therapy was safer than open surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "To assess the potential benefit of the addition of a covered stent to a subintimal recanalized artery in patients with femoro-popliteal occlusions.\nFrom September 2003 to October 2005, we retrospectively analyzed all patients admitted for severe claudication or critical limb ischemia related to long femoro-popliteal occlusions and treated with subintimal recanalization. Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they received a stent or not. All patients in the group treated with stent received a stent graft, and the entire length of the recanalized artery was covered in each case. Demographic data, indications, procedure, and outcomes were examined using survival analysis statistical techniques.\nFifty-three patients (54 limbs) were treated consecutively for severe claudication (n=19) or critical limb ischemia (n=34). Thirty-four (64%) had a stent placed, while 19 (35.8%) did not. The mean length of the lesions treated was 20.11 cm (range, 5-35 cm). Statistically, there was no significant difference in lesion length, Rutherford stage of peripheral-artery disease, Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification, and distal run-off between the two groups. The technical success rate was 94.5%, and two out of the three failures were treated with surgical bypass in one case and major amputation in the other. The third patient received only medical treatment. Combined procedures were required in the treatment of 68.2% of limbs in the no-stent group and 55.8% in the stent group. Mean follow up was 16.9 months (range, 1-35 months). At 1 year, primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency for the stent vs no-stent groups was, respectively, 61.8% vs 78.9% (P=.49), 70.6% vs 78.9% (P=.78), and 88.2% vs 78.9% (P=.22). The 1-year limb salvage rate for the stent vs no-stent group was 94.1% vs 100% (P=.7).\nCombining subintimal angioplasty with a stent graft in femoro-popliteal lesions does not improve patency. The limb salvage rate remains high after addition of a stent graft. Rigorous monitoring is recommended to diagnose and treat restenosis early in order to improve patency.",

    "abstract": "There has been a rapid increase in the number of endovascular procedures performed for peripheral artery disease, and especially aorto-iliac occlusive disease (AIOD). Results from single-center reports suggest a benefit for endovascular procedures; however, these benefits may not reflect general practice. We used a population-based analysis to determine predictors of clinical and economic outcomes following open and endovascular procedures for inpatients with AIOD.\nAll patients with AIOD who underwent open and endovascular procedures in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2004 to 2007, were identified. Independent patient- and provider-related characteristics were analyzed. Clinical outcomes included complications and mortality; economic outcomes included length of stay (LOS) and cost (2007 dollars). Outcomes were compared using \u03c72, ANOVA, and multivariate regression analysis.\nFour thousand, one hundred nineteen patients with AIOD were identified. Endovascular procedures increased by 18%. Patients who underwent endovascular procedures were more likely to be \u226565 years of age (46% vs 37%), female (54% vs 49%), and in the highest quartile of household income (20% vs 16%), all P<.05. Endovascular patients were more likely to be non-elective (41% vs 20%), in the highest comorbidity index group (8% vs 5%), and with iliac artery disease (67% vs 33%), all P\u2264.05. In bivariate analysis, endovascular procedures were associated with lower complication rates (16% vs 25%), shorter LOS (2.2 vs 5.8 days), and lower hospital costs ($13,661 vs $17,161), all P<.001. In multivariate analysis, endovascular procedures had significantly lower complication rates and cost, and shorter LOS.\nEndovascular procedures have superior short-term clinical and economic outcomes compared with open procedures for the treatment of AIOD in the inpatient setting. Further studies are needed to examine long-term outcomes and access-related issues.",

    "abstract": "While the significance of type II endoleaks (T2ELs) on the long-term outcome of endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is debatable, duplex ultrasonography (DU) parameters have been suggested to be predictive of their closure or persistence. The purpose of this study was to determine which, if any, of these variables was associated with persistent T2EL or increased AAA sac diameter.\nBetween 1998 and 2009, 278 patients underwent EVAR and post-operative DU surveillance during long-term follow-up (1-11 years) in our accredited non-invasive vascular laboratory by one of three experienced technologists. DU measured intra-sac flow velocity (IFV), spectral doppler waveform (SDW) patterns, post-EVAR sac diameter, and number of T2ELs.\nT2ELs developed in 14% (38/278) of patients post-EVAR. Fourteen patients had T2ELs that resolved, and sac diameter decreased or remained the same: the average IFV was 42 cm/second; SDW patterns were monophasic in five, biphasic in seven and bidirectional in two; and multiple T2ELs were not present (0%) in any patient. Twelve patients had T2ELs that persisted, but sac diameter decreased or remained the same: the average IFV was 47 cm/second; SDW patterns were monophasic in one, biphasic in five, bidirectional in five, and undetermined in one; and multiple T2ELs were found in 17% (2) of patients. Twelve patients had T2ELs that persisted and were associated with increased sac diameter: the average IFV was 43 cm/second, SDW patterns were monophasic in one, biphasic in two, and bidirectional in nine; and multiple T2ELs were identified in 75% (9) of patients. None of the 38 patients with T2ELs treated with selective surgical or endovascular intervention for enlarging sac diameters (11/12) experienced a ruptured aneurysm.\nContrary to previous smaller reports of T2ELs and DU surveillance, parameters such as IFV did not correlate with increased post-EVAR sac diameter. The presence of multiple T2ELs and bidirectional SDW may be the strongest factors predictive of increased sac diameter.",

Extrinsic compression was diagnosed by duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography. We performed laparoscopic decompression using the transperitoneal retrorenal approach.

    "abstract": "Despite the efficacy of collagen in femoral artery pseudoaneurysm treatment, as reported in one patient study, its use has not yet gained wide acceptance in clinical practice. In this particular study, the collagen was not described in detail. To further investigate the potential of collagen preparations, we prepared and characterized highly purified injectable fibrillar type I collagen and evaluated its use for femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (PSA) treatment in vivo using a pig model.\nPurified fibrillar type I collagen was characterized using electron microscopy. The effect of three different sterilization procedures, ie, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (H2O2), ethylene oxide gas (EtO), and gamma irradiation, was studied on both SDS-PAGE and platelet aggregation. Different collagen injectables were prepared (3%, 4%, and 5%) and tested using an injection force test applying a 21-gauge needle. To evaluate the network characteristics of the injectable collagen, the collagen was suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37\u00b0C and studied both macroscopically and electron microscopically. To determine whether the collagen induced hemostasis in vivo, a pig PSA model was used applying a 4% EtO sterilized collagen injectable, and evaluation by angiography and routine histology.\nElectron microscopy of the purified type I collagen revealed intact fibrils with a distinct striated pattern and a length<300 \u03bcm. Both SDS-PAGE and platelet aggregation analysis of the sterilized collagen indicated no major differences between EtO and H2O2 sterilization, although gamma-irradiated collagen showed degradation products. Both 3% and 4% (w/v) collagen suspensions were acceptable with respect to the force used (<50 N). The 4% suspension was selected as the preferred injectable collagen, which formed a dense network under physiologic conditions.

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that prior endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) confers protective effects in the setting of ruptured AAA (rAAA). This study was conducted to compare outcomes of rAAA repairs in patients with and without prior EVAR.\nA retrospective review identified 18 patients with (group 1) and 233 patients without (group 2) antecedent EVAR who presented with rAAA from January 2001 to December 2008. Patient characteristics and perioperative variables were noted and the outcomes were compared. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors contributing to morbidity and mortality and Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate late survival rates.\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups. Mean age was 78 years in group 1 and 74.8 years in group 2 (P=.17). Men comprised 83.3% of patients in group 1 and 77.3% in group 2 (P=.77). Hemodynamic instability at rAAA was noted with similar frequency between groups, 55.6% vs 52.6%, respectively (P=.99). Mean time from EVAR to rAAA was 4.0 years and from last follow-up computed tomography (CT) 1.2 years. The devices involved were Ancure (Guidant, Menlo Park, Calif) (9), AneuRx (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) (5), Zenith (Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, Ind) (3), and Excluder (W.L Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) (1). Mean preoperative AAA size was 6.4 cm in group 1. All but 1 patient had an endoleak at the time of rupture. Of 14 patients with CT follow-up, only 3 patients had a known increase in size (\u22655 mm) and only 3 were known to have an endoleak. Fifteen patients were treated by a single intervention, whereas 3 patients underwent multiple procedures. In group 2, open repair was performed in 218 patients and EVAR in 15. Morbidity (66.7% vs 56.7%) and in-hospital mortality (38.9% vs 36.9%) were nearly identical between groups. One-year survival rates (27.8% vs 48.2%; P=.15) were also similar. The mortality rates for EVAR for primary rAAA was 20% as compared to 38.1% for open repair for rAAAs (P=.27).\nrAAA remains a lethal problem in patients with and without prior EVAR alike. An existing endograft provides neither acute nor 1-year survival benefits after rAAA repairs. Prediction of patients at risk for rupture post-EVAR is difficult, as only a minority of patients had a known prior endoleak or sac enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Despite overall improvement, there is still a gender-related disparity in the outcomes of lower extremities peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We analyzed sex-related variability among factors that are known to influence outcomes.\nData on PAD inpatient hospitalizations from New York, New Jersey, and Florida state hospital discharge databases (1998-2007) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.\nOf the 372,692 surgical hospitalizations identified, 162,730 (43.66%) involved women. Men and women undergoing vascular procedures differed in that more men smoked (18% vs 14%; P<.0001), and more men had coronary artery disease (40% vs 33%; P<.0001). Women were more likely to be obese (11.86% vs 4.89%; P<.0001), black (18.81% vs 12.66%; P<.0001), older, and have critical limb ischemia (CLI) (39.41% vs 37.67%; P<.0001). They had higher mortality (5.26% vs 4.21%; P<.0001) and complication rates, especially bleeding (10.62 % vs 8.19%; P<.0001) and infection (3.23% vs 2.88%; P<.0001). Mortality rates after endovascular procedures were lower and showed marginal difference between genders (2.87% vs 2.11%; P<.0001). The difference was more pronounced after open revascularizations (5.05% for women vs 4.00% for men; P<.0001) and amputations (9.82% for women vs 8.82% for men; P<.0001). Bleeding differences between men and women were greatest when both open and endovascular procedures were done during the same hospitalizations and lowest after major amputations. Similar to bleeding, transgender differences in postoperative infections were more pronounced after combination of open and endovascular procedures. Using a multivariable model, female gender remained a predictor of perioperative mortality, infection, and bleeding after vascular intervention (odds ratios 1.15, 1.21, and 1.32, respectively). Female gender negatively influenced the mortality of patients with cerebrovascular and coronary disease and those of black race even after adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors. Gender effect on mortality dissipated in octogenarians and patients with claudication.\nFemale gender continues to be an important risk factor that negatively influences the outcomes of vascular interventions; however, these effects vary between different high-risk groups and procedures. Gender effect on mortality dissipates in elderly patients. Prompt recognition of the associations between gender and various risk factors of cardiovascular disease and aggressive modification of these risk factors in female patients may improve gender-related disparity in the outcomes of vascular disease.",

Gender effect on mortality dissipates in elderly patients. Prompt recognition of the associations between gender and various risk factors of cardiovascular disease and aggressive modification of these risk factors in female patients may improve gender-related disparity in the outcomes of vascular disease.",

Men and women undergoing vascular procedures differed in that more men smoked (18% vs 14%; P<.0001), and more men had coronary artery disease (40% vs 33%; P<.0001). Women were more likely to be obese (11.86% vs 4.89%; P<.0001), black (18.81% vs 12.66%; P<.0001), older, and have critical limb ischemia (CLI) (39.41% vs 37.67%; P<.0001). They had higher mortality (5.26% vs 4.21%; P<.0001) and complication rates, especially bleeding (10.62 % vs 8.19%; P<.0001) and infection (3.23% vs 2.88%; P<.0001). Mortality rates after endovascular procedures were lower and showed marginal difference between genders (2.87% vs 2.11%; P<.0001). The difference was more pronounced after open revascularizations (5.05% for women vs 4.00% for men; P<.0001) and amputations (9.82% for women vs 8.82% for men; P<.0001). Bleeding differences between men and women were greatest when both open and endovascular procedures were done during the same hospitalizations and lowest after major amputations. Similar to bleeding, transgender differences in postoperative infections were more pronounced after combination of open and endovascular procedures. Using a multivariable model, female gender remained a predictor of perioperative mortality, infection, and bleeding after vascular intervention (odds ratios 1.15, 1.21, and 1.32, respectively). Female gender negatively influenced the mortality of patients with cerebrovascular and coronary disease and those of black race even after adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors. Gender effect on mortality dissipated in octogenarians and patients with claudication.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed the clinical and morphologic outcomes of endovascular treatment of ruptured isolated iliac artery aneurysms (RIIAA) at midterm follow-up.\nEleven patients with RIIAA (1 woman, 10 men; mean age, 73 years; mean IIAA diameter, 69.1 mm) were identified in a single-center database of patients who underwent endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair between April 2001 and December 2009. Devices inserted included 9 leg endografts in 7 patients (Excluder, n=7; Zenith, n=2), 3 bifurcated stent grafts in 3 patients (Excluder), and 1 aortouniiliac stent graft in 1 patient (Zenith). Endovascular occlusion of the internal iliac artery or its branches was performed in all cases by coils (n=10) or Amplatzer occluder plug (n=1). Immediately after endovascular aneurysm exclusion, a computed tomography (CT) angiography was obtained in nine patients. Except for this adjunct postimplantation CT scanning, the imaging follow-up was the same as for nonruptured aortoiliac aneurysms at 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter.\nMean delay from hospital admission to intervention was 78.5 minutes. Mean intervention time was 150 minutes. The assisted primary technical success rate was 100%. Median lengths of stay were 2 days in the intensive care unit and 13 days in the hospital. Abdominal compartment syndrome developed in three patients who received open abdomen treatment. The 30-day mortality was 18%. The mean follow-up was 23 months (range, 0-69 months). There were no late deaths during the follow-up. There was no need for late surgical conversion. Aneurysm sac shrinkage (defined as >5 mm) was recorded in five patients, whereas the sac diameter remained stable in four. There was no patient with aneurysm sac growth. Additional stent graft insertion as the only secondary intervention for a type Ib leak was performed. Type II endoleaks (primary and secondary) were found in 36% and secondary Ib in 9% of the patients.\nEmergency stent grafting of RIIAA is feasible and safe with good midterm outcome.",

    "abstract": "Supraceliac aortic clamping in major vascular procedures promotes splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury that may induce endothelial dysfunction, widespread inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. We tested the hypothesis that local or remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) may be protective against injury after supraceliac aortic clamping through the modulation of mesenteric leukocyte-endothelial interactions, as evaluated with intravital microscopy and expression of adhesion molecules.\nFifty-six male Wistar rats (weight, 190 to 250 g), were divided into four groups of 14 rats each: control-sham surgery without aortic occlusion; I/R through supraceliac aortic occlusion for 20 minutes, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion; local IPC through supraceliac aortic occlusion for two cycles of 5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reperfusion, followed by the same protocol of the IR group; remote IPC through infrarenal aortic occlusion for two cycles of 10 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion, followed by the same protocol of the IR group. Seven animals per group were used to evaluate in vivo leukocyte-endothelial interactions in postcapillary venules with intravital microscopy and another seven animals per group were used to collect mesentery samples for immunohistochemistry demonstration of adhesion molecules expression.\nSupraceliac aortic occlusion increased the number of rolling leukocytes with slower velocities and increased the number of adherent leukocytes to the venular surface and leukocyte migration to the interstitium. The expression of P-selectin, E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was also increased significantly after I/R. Local or remote IPC reduced the leukocyte recruitment in vivo and normalized the expression of adhesion molecules.\nLocal or remote IPC reduces endothelial dysfunction on mesenteric microcirculation caused by I/R injury after supraceliac aortic clamping.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of warfarin pre-treatment in the prevention of PE after PTBA in patients with large inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus.\nFrom October 2002 to December 2009, 16 patients with symptomatic membranous or segmental IVC occlusion and large thrombus were treated with warfarin before PTBA. Eleven patients were men and 5 were women. The median age was 36 years, ranging from 21 to 52 years. The median duration of warfarin treatment before PTBA was 7 months, ranging from 3 to 12 months. Fourteen patients had membranous IVC occlusion and 2 had segmental occlusion. All 16 patients had significant thrombi underneath the obstructive lesions. PE diagnosis was based on clinical presentation and pulmonary computerized tomographic angiogram, if indicated.\nIn 14 of 16 patients, IVC thrombus was completely or near-completely resolved based on follow-up cavogram and PTBA was performed. In the other 2 patients, residual thrombus was demonstrated by cavogram at 12 months. PTBA and stent placement were carried out. IVC patency in the 16 patients was confirmed by completion cavogram. No major bleeding complication during warfarin pre-treatment aimed to keep international normalized ratio (INR) 2 to 3. There was no clinically significant PE or death in this group during follow-up, ranging from 6 to 40 months (median 21 months).\nSpontaneous fibrinolysis of IVC thrombus occurs within 1 year in the majority of the patients treated with warfarin.

    "abstract": "Patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are at highest risk for the postthrombotic morbidity including all aspects of the postthrombotic syndrome. Invasive therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and/or mechanical thrombectomy with or without angioplasty and stenting and in some cases open operative thrombectomy improves venous patency, venous valve function, and quality of life in patients with acute iliofemoral DVT. What is the current frequency of acute iliofemoral DVT and how aggressively is it being treated? We hypothesize that the 10-year period frequency of iliofemoral DVT among acute DVT cases is greater than previously reported. Further, we hypothesize that thrombus removal to treat acute iliofemoral DVT is little utilized in current practice.\nIndiana University (IU) vascular laboratory records from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2008 were searched by CPT code for venous Doppler ultrasound study (n=7240). A random sample based on the IU medical record number of lower extremity Doppler studies was then selected (n=1020) for retrospective chart review. Corresponding clinical information was gathered from the patients' electronic medical record.\nAcute DVT occurred in 6.8%, and chronic DVT in 8.8% of patients studied (25.7% inpatient, 61.7% female; median age, 56.0 years [range, 4-91 years, 1.1% less than 16 years]). History of previous DVT (33.3%) and cancer (30.4%) were the most common risk factors in patients with acute DVT. Iliofemoral DVT defined as having an iliac or common femoral vein component was identified in 49.3% of acute DVT and in 36.0% of chronic DVT. CDT was utilized in 14.3% and mechanical thrombectomy in 4.8% of acute iliofemoral DVT, and was never used with distal DVT. Warfarin anticoagulation+unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin overlap was the most common treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT (100.0%). In 2008, the referral base of our laboratory increased significantly. Acute DVT occurred significantly less often during the 1-year period 2008 (5.3%) than the 10-year period 1998-2007 (7.6%), but iliofemoral+common femoral DVT as a component of acute DVT did not differ significantly.\nIliofemoral DVT may be more frequent than previously reported and represents a significant portion of acute DVT. Current recommendations of acute thrombus removal for the treatment of iliofemoral DVT is underutilized suggesting that perhaps greater education of clinicians and patients regarding invasive therapy for iliofemoral DVT is required.",

    "abstract": "Current long-term surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at scheduled, lifelong intervals. The cancer and nephrotoxicity risks of interval CT scanning and prolonged radiation exposure are concerning. We sought to determine if surveillance CT angiography (CTA) can be safely reduced.\nFrom July 2000 to November 2007, 345 patients were enrolled in U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials of the Powerlink System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif). An independent core laboratory analyzed 1519 post-EVAR CT scans (N=1519) to 5 years to evaluate aneurysm size, migration, presence of endoleak, and evidence of graft obstruction. Analyses were conducted to determine the value of the initial CTA scan in predicting future secondary procedures in enrolled patients.\nAt any time during follow-up, CTA identified endoleak in 123 patients (36%), with 95% of endoleaks being type II. In addition, 49 patients underwent 72 secondary procedures at a mean of 22\u00b121 months (range, 2-2007 days) after initial EVAR. These were based on clinical identification of limb ischemia in 13 interventions (18%) or core laboratory identification of abnormal CT finding in 58 interventions (81%). Of the 58 core laboratory identified findings, the inciting abnormality was present on the initial postoperative scan in 49 (84%). Of the remaining nine CT-driven procedures, three (5.2%) were due to late sac expansion attributed to type II endoleak (n=2) or endotension (n=1); two (3.4%) were for prophylactic reasons in the absence of endoleak; and four (6.8%) were in patients with type II endoleak not observed by the core laboratory and without sac expansion. The negative predictive value of the initial postoperative CTA for the need for a secondary procedure is therefore 96.4%, which can be improved to 97.6% with duplex ultrasound surveillance to detect sac expansion. Thus, a negative initial postoperative CTA is highly predictive of long-term freedom from secondary intervention.\nAmong enrolled patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR, most abnormalities that result in a secondary procedure are detected on the initial postoperative CTA or present with clinical symptoms. Long-term surveillance CTA may therefore be replaced by duplex ultrasound imaging if the initial postoperative CTA shows no abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have investigated the predictive value of clinical and morphologic parameters for distal embolization during carotid interventions. The composition of the atherosclerotic plaque, using virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) imaging obtained with an IVUS catheter that is advanced through the lesion after a filter has been placed distally, has not been evaluated as a marker for cerebral embolization. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between atherosclerotic plaque composition determined with VH-IVUS and the occurrence of cerebral embolization after carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nDuring a 10-month period, 24 patients undergoing CAS procedures using a filter device for embolic protection were prospectively evaluated. All patients underwent VH-IVUS exams at the time of the intervention, transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring during CAS, and pre- and 24-hour postprocedural diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) exams. Using VH-IVUS, plaque components were characterized as fibrotic, fibrofatty, dense calcium, and necrotic core. The frequency of Doppler-detected microembolic signals (MES) during CAS and the incidence and location of acute postprocedural embolic lesions detected with DW-MRI were assessed to determine cerebral embolization. Univariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the association between plaque composition and frequency of cerebral embolization.\nNo periprocedural transient ischemic attacks, strokes, or deaths occurred within 30 days. Seventeen patients (71%) demonstrated new acute cerebral emboli in DW-MRI. Of these, all revealed ipsilateral lesions and 12 (50%) had contralateral lesions. For the entire study group, the median number of ipsilateral DW-MRI lesions was 1 (range, 0 to 3), and TCD MES counts were 227 (interquartile range, 143-315). Volumetric VH-IVUS analysis revealed that there was a trend for larger median dense calcium volume in patients with ipsilateral subclinical cerebral embolism detected with DW-MRI (33.2\u00b124.5 mm3 vs 11.4\u00b16.1 mm3; P=.08). Scatter plots of plaque components revealed statistically significant correlation between fibrofatty plaque volume (Spearman r=0.49; P=.016) and number of new ipsilateral lesions in DW-MRI. Degree of cerebral embolization during CAS measured with TCD correlated with plaque burden, necrotic core, fibrofatty, and fibrous volumes.\nPlaque composition, as determined by VH-IVUS, only weakly correlates with the degree of cerebral embolization after carotid stenting. Specifically, there is a trend for larger dense calcium volume in patients with distal embolization. Of note, the proportion of necrotic core, which has traditionally been considered the main component of a vulnerable or unstable plaque, is not definitely associated with subclinical cerebral embolization after CAS when a filter device for embolic protection is used. The role of VH-IVUS in evaluating plaque composition during CAS remains unestablished and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The standard approach for carotid endarterectomy cannot provide adequate exposure of the distal internal carotid artery in the presence of high cervical carotid bifurcation or high plaque. Limited accessibility of the distal internal carotid artery has resulted in the development of various operative techniques. Mandibular subluxation is the most simple and least invasive technique, but it does require invasive maneuvers, such as wiring, to stabilize the mandible. We use a mouthpiece made by the dentist to stabilize the mandible in the physiologic subluxated position. This technique provides an adequate exposure of the distal internal carotid artery as with the other methods, and the risk of morbidity is very low.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is considered by many as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the management of carotid artery stenosis. However, recent trials demonstrated inferior results for CAS in symptomatic patients compared with CEA. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the appropriateness of CAS for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and to determine the pathogenetic mechanism(s) associated with stroke following the treatment of such lesions. Based on this, we propose steps to improve the results of CAS for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nPubMed/Medline was searched up to March 25, 2010 for studies investigating the efficacy of CAS for the management of symptomatic carotid stenosis. Search terms used were \"carotid artery stenting,\" \"symptomatic carotid artery stenosis,\" \"carotid endarterectomy,\" \"stroke,\" \"recurrent carotid stenosis,\" and \"long-term results\" in various combinations.\nCurrent data suggest that CAS is not equivalent to CEA for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis. Differences in carotid plaque morphology and a higher incidence of microemboli and cerebrovascular events during and after CAS compared with CEA may account for these inferior results.\nCurrently, most symptomatic patients are inappropriate candidates for CAS. Improved CAS technology referable to stent design and embolic protection strategies may alter this conclusion in the future.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to tremendous blood flow-induced venous wall thickening during the maturation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, how veins in the fistula sense a dramatic change in the blood flow remains unknown. Because mechanosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid channels (TRPVs) are present in the endothelium, we examined whether the Ca2+-permeable TRPVs play a role in remodeling of fistula veins.\nThe fistula veins were generated at femoral AVF of Wistar rats. Changes in the hemodynamics and the width and internal radius of the iliac vein were studied at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days, then the iliac vein was removed and examined for changes in wall thickness and protein or mRNA expression by immunofluorecent stain, Western blot, or real time PCR. Changes in MMP2 activity was examined by gelatin zymography. Two ligatures were performed in iliac vein to prevent venodilatation to confirm the effect of dramatic changes in hemodynamics on TRPV expression. The specific role of TRPV was studied in another group of fistula veins given with capsazepine via a subcutaneous mini-osmotic pump for 28 days.\nThe fistula veins demonstrated high flow/wall shear stress (WSS), wall thickening, and venodilatation compared with control veins. The WSS increase was positively correlated with upregulation of TRPV1, but not TRPV4. Narrowing fistula veins prevented TRPV1 upregulation, indicating that high flow directly upregulates TRPV1. We examined the underlying signaling components and found that enhanced Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) activity upregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and downregulated arginase I in the fistula veins. These changes were reversed by a CaMK II inhibitor. The relative levels of eNOS and arginase I activity consequently augmented NO formation, which coincided with an increase in MMP2 activity. Chronic inhibition of TRPV1 in the fistula veins by capsazepine showed no effect on high flow and TRPV1 expression, but markedly attenuated WSS, which was concomitantly associated with attenuation of CaMK II activity, NO-dependent MMP2 activation, and remodeling.\nThese findings indicate that TRPV1 is essential in the remodeling of AVFs and that WSS leads to TRPV1 upregulation, which then enhances remodeling, therefore, inhibition of TRPV1 pathway may prolong the lifespan of an AVF by decreasing WSS and vein wall remodeling.",

Chronic inhibition of TRPV1 in the fistula veins by capsazepine showed no effect on high flow and TRPV1 expression, but markedly attenuated WSS, which was concomitantly associated with attenuation of CaMK II activity, NO-dependent MMP2 activation, and remodeling.",

    "abstract": "The ideal treatment for hospitalized patients with isolated gastrocnemius and/or soleal venous thrombosis is unclear. Recommendations range from watchful waiting to full-dose anticoagulation. This study examines the effectiveness of practice patterns at a single institution as measured by progression of thrombus.\nAll consecutive inpatients with a duplex scan diagnosis of isolated gastrocnemius and/or soleal vein clot (no other thrombotic segments were identified) and where two consecutive duplex studies (Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories laboratory) were available for review were included. Two study groups were identified. TX group included patients who received anticoagulation treatment (heparin [fractionated or unfractionated], heparin substitutes, or warfarin) and the NoTX group included those who did not receive anticoagulant. Demographic, risk factors, comorbidities, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, ambulatory status, and underlying hypercoagulable states were recorded. Thrombus progression rate in the two groups was compared using the \u03c72 test. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the effect of anticoagulation treatment as well as the above demographic and clinical factors on the risk of progression.\nA total of 141 patients were included in the study, 76 of whom (54%) received anticoagulation. Forty-three patients (30%) had progression of their venous thrombosis: 33% (25/76) in the TX group and 28% (18/65) in the NoTX group (P=.50, by \u03c72 test). Results from multivariate logistic regression showed that treatment had no significant impact on outcome (Odds ratio=1.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.55-3.01; P=.57]. Patients with end-stage renal disease (6%), or stroke (13%) had significantly higher risk of progression (P<.05). None of the other clinical or demographic factors were significantly associated with the risk of progression.\nThe results speak to the lack of efficacy of anticoagulation in the management of gastrocnemius and/or soleal vein thrombosis in the hospitalized patient. When measured by thrombus progression, treating these patients without anticoagulation appears to be equally efficacious as subjecting patients to anticoagulant therapy. A prospective, randomized clinical trial will be an important step in fully addressing this clinical dilemma.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is a potential strategy for reducing intimal thickening during in-stent restenosis and vein graft failure. In this study, we examined the effect of disrupting the function of the VSMC adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, using antagonists, neutralizing antibodies, and a dominant negative, on VSMC migration and intimal thickening. Migration was assessed by the scratch-wound assay of human saphenous vein VSMCs and in a human saphenous vein ex vivo organ culture model of intimal thickening.\nInhibition of cadherin function using a pan-cadherin antagonist, significantly reduced migration by 53%\u00b18% compared with the control peptide (n=3; P<.05). Furthermore, inhibition of N-cadherin function with an N-cadherin antagonist, neutralizing antibodies, and adenoviral expression of dominant negative N-cadherin (RAd dn-N-cadherin), significantly reduced migration by 31%\u00b12%, 23%\u00b11% and 32%\u00b17% compared with controls, respectively (n=3; P<.05). Inhibition of cadherin function significantly increased apoptosis by between 1.5- and 3.3-fold at the wound edge. In an ex vivo model of intimal thickening, inhibition of N-cadherin function by infection of human saphenous vein segments with RAd dn-N-cadherin significantly reduced VSMC migration by 55% and increased VSMC apoptosis by 2.7-fold. As a result, intimal thickening was significantly suppressed by 54%\u00b114%. Importantly, there was no detrimental effect of dn-N-cadherin on endothelial coverage; in fact, it was significantly increased, as was survival of cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells.\nUnder the condition of this study, cell-cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin regulates VSMC migration via modulation of viability. Interestingly, inhibition of N-cadherin function significantly retards intimal thickening via inhibition of VSMC migration and promotion of endothelial cell survival. We suggest that disruption of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts is a potential strategy for reducing VSMC migration and intimal thickening.",

    "abstract": "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare disorder characterized by abdominal pain and compression of the celiac artery. Traditional management consists of open MAL division, with or without arterial reconstruction. We present our outcomes using a laparoscopic approach and compare them to patients treated with open MAL division during the same period.\nA retrospective medical records review of all patients with MALS treated at the University of California-Los Angeles from January 1999 to 2009 was performed.\nFourteen patients with MALS were treated. All patients underwent an extensive preoperative gastrointestinal (GI) workup with 10 undergoing attempted laparoscopic division of the MAL and celiac ganglion (laparoscopic ganglionectomy [LG]). Two intraoperative conversions were performed for bleeding. Six patients were treated in the open surgery group (open ganglionectomy [OG]). There were no deaths or reoperations in either group. Median time to feeding was 1.0 vs 2.8 days (P\u2264.05) in the LG and OG groups, respectively, which was statistically significant. Median length of hospitalization was also significantly lower in the LG group compared with the OG group (2.3 vs 7.0 days; P\u2264.05). Eight patients had LG (100%) and 5 patients had OG (83%) and had immediate symptom resolution (postoperative day 1). Three patients with recurrent symptoms after LG underwent angiography demonstrating persistent celiac stenosis, then an angioplasty was performed. Median follow-up was 14.0 months (2-65 months) for all patients. Three patients who received LG (38%) and 3 patients who received OG (50%) had persistent pain at last follow-up. Six patients in the OG group (100%) and 7 patients in the LG group (88%) had ceased taking chronic oral narcotics at their last follow-up visit.\nBoth laparoscopic and open MAL division and celiac ganglionectomy can be safely performed with minimal patient morbidity and mortality. Late recurrence is frequently seen; however, this seems to be milder than the presenting symptoms. The laparoscopic approach results in avoidance of laparotomy and was associated with shorter inpatient hospitalization and decreased time to feeding in our study. Optimal patient selection and prediction of clinical response in these patients remains a challenge.",

    "conclusions": "Both laparoscopic and open MAL division and celiac ganglionectomy can be safely performed with minimal patient morbidity and mortality. Late recurrence is frequently seen; however, this seems to be milder than the presenting symptoms. The laparoscopic approach results in avoidance of laparotomy and was associated with shorter inpatient hospitalization and decreased time to feeding in our study. Optimal patient selection and prediction of clinical response in these patients remains a challenge.",

All patients underwent an extensive preoperative gastrointestinal (GI) workup with 10 undergoing attempted laparoscopic division of the MAL and celiac ganglion (laparoscopic ganglionectomy [LG]). Two intraoperative conversions were performed for bleeding. Six patients were treated in the open surgery group (open ganglionectomy [OG]). There were no deaths or reoperations in either group. Median time to feeding was 1.0 vs 2.8 days (P\u2264.05) in the LG and OG groups, respectively, which was statistically significant. Median length of hospitalization was also significantly lower in the LG group compared with the OG group (2.3 vs 7.0 days; P\u2264.05). Eight patients had LG (100%) and 5 patients had OG (83%) and had immediate symptom resolution (postoperative day 1). Three patients with recurrent symptoms after LG underwent angiography demonstrating persistent celiac stenosis, then an angioplasty was performed. Median follow-up was 14.0 months (2-65 months) for all patients. Three patients who received LG (38%) and 3 patients who received OG (50%) had persistent pain at last follow-up. Six patients in the OG group (100%) and 7 patients in the LG group (88%) had ceased taking chronic oral narcotics at their last follow-up visit.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of isolated calf muscle vein thrombosis (ICMVT) is controversial. There are no data from prospective, controlled studies. Objective of this article was to compare the efficacy and safety of a short-term course of anticoagulation with compression therapy alone.\nWe prospectively randomized patients with symptomatic, sonographically proven ICMVT in the soleal and/or gastrocnemial muscle veins in two treatment arms. The first received low-molecular-weight heparin for 10 days at therapeutic dosage (nadroparin 180 anti-activated factor X units once daily) and compression therapy for three months, and the second received compression therapy alone. Primary efficacy endpoint of the study was sonographically proven progression of ICMVT into the deep veins and clinical pulmonary embolism (PE) as confirmed by objective testing. Secondary efficacy and primary safety endpoints were major bleeding, death not due to PE, and complete sonographically proven recanalization of the muscle vein. We assessed transient and permanent risk factors for venous thromboembolism.\nOne-hundred seven patients were finally ruled eligible for evaluation: 89% outpatients, 11% hospitalized patients. In the heparin group (n=54) progression to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in two patients (3.7%), in the group compression therapy alone (n=53) progression to DVT occurred in two patients (n.s.). No clinical PE and no death occurred. Thrombus recanalization after 3 months was not statistically significant different between the two study groups. No major bleeding occurred.\nThe data do not show superiority of a short-term regimen of low-molecular-weight heparin and compression therapy in comparison with compression therapy alone in patients with ICMVT in a rather low-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Current multidisciplinary guidelines recommend to treat extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) by surgical revascularization. Surgery provides good long-term patency, but at the cost of substantial perioperative morbidity. Development of new technologies and techniques has led to increased use of endovascular therapy for extensive AIOD. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine contemporary short- and long-term results of endovascular therapy for extensive AIOD.\nThe Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all studies reporting endovascular treatment of extensive AIOD (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) type C and D) from January 2000 to June 2009. Two independent observers selected studies for inclusion, assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies, and performed the data extraction. Outcomes were technical success, clinical success, mortality, complications, long-term primary, and secondary patency rates.\nNineteen nonrandomized cohort studies reporting on 1711 patients were included. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity between the studies considering study population and interventional techniques. Technical success was achieved in 86% to 100% of the patients. Clinical symptoms improved in 83% to 100%. Mortality was described in seven studies and ranged from 1.2% to 6.7%. Complications were reported in 3% to 45% of the patients. Most common complications were distal embolization, access site hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, arterial ruptures, and arterial dissections. The majority of complications could be treated using percutaneous or noninvasive techniques. Four- or 5-year primary and secondary patency rates ranged from 60% to 86% and 80% to 98%, respectively.\nEndovascular treatment of extensive AIOD can be performed successfully by experienced interventionists in selected patients. Although primary patency rates are lower than those reported for surgical revascularization, reinterventions can often be performed percutaneously, with secondary patency comparable to surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis results in vasomotor dysfunction, in part, through impairment of nitric oxide (NO) dependent vasodilation. It is unclear whether blood vessels are dysfunctional in an early environment of hypercholesterolemia alone and if this contributes to the vascular injury response. We hypothesize that early hypercholesterolemia, prior to gross vascular changes, contributes to vasomotor dysfunction and the vascular injury response. The efficacy of NO therapy to protect against the injury response in this setting was also assessed.\nThe effect of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene transfer on rat aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation was measured with (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Common carotid arteries (CCA) from wild-type C57BL6 (WT or C57) and apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE KO) mice fed normal or Western diets for 6 to 8 weeks were tested for vasomotor function using an arteriograph system. Studies were repeated after CCA injury. The effect of iNOS gene transfer on morphometry by histology and vasomotor responses in injured CCAs in ApoE KO was examined.\nOxLDL increased SMC proliferation by >50%. In SMC expressing iNOS, NO production was unaffected by oxLDL and reduced oxLDL and still inhibited SMC proliferation. Endothelium dependent vasorelaxation was reduced in uninjured CCAs from ApoE KO and C57 mice on the Western vs normal diet (ApoE 39% \u00b1 2% vs 55% \u00b1 13%; C57 50% \u00b1 13% vs 76% \u00b1 5%, P < .001) and was increased with longer durations of hypercholesterolemia. Endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilator responses were severely disrupted in C57 and ApoE KO mice 2 weeks following CCA injury but both recovered by 4 weeks. CCA injury in ApoE KO mice resulted in the formation of atheromatous lesions while C57 mice showed no change (intima 27,795 \u00b1 1829 vs 237 \u00b1 28 \u03bcm(2); media 46,306 \u00b1 2448 vs 11,714 \u00b1 392 \u03bcm(2), respectively; P < .001). This structural change in the ApoE KO reduced distensibility and increased stiffness. Finally, iNOS gene transfer to injured CCA in ApoE KO mice dramatically reduced atheromatous neointimal lesion formation.\nEarly hypercholesterolemia impairs endothelial function, with severity being related to duration and magnitude of hypercholesterolemia. Severe hypercholesterolemia leads to atheromatous lesion formation following injury and stresses the role of vascular injury in atherogenesis and suggests different mechanisms are involved in endothelial dysfunction and the injury response. Despite these changes, iNOS gene transfer still effectively inhibits atheroma formation. These findings support early correction of hypercholesterolemia and emphasize the potential role for NO based therapies in disease states.",

This structural change in the ApoE KO reduced distensibility and increased stiffness. Finally, iNOS gene transfer to injured CCA in ApoE KO mice dramatically reduced atheromatous neointimal lesion formation.",

    "abstract": "Disparities in limb salvage procedures may be driven by socioeconomic status (SES) and access to high-volume hospitals. We sought to identify SES factors associated with major amputation in the setting of critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nThe 2003-2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for discharges containing lower extremity revascularization (LER) or major amputation and chronic CLI (N = 958,120). The Elixhauser method was used to adjust for comorbidities. Significant predictors in bivariate logistic regression were entered into a multivariate logistic regression for the dependent variable of amputation vs LER.\nOverall, 24.2% of CLI patients underwent amputation. Significant differences were seen between both groups in bivariate and multivariate analysis of SES factors, including race, income, and insurance status. Lower-income patients were more likely to be treated at low-LER-volume institutions (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; P < .001). Patients at higher-LER-volume centers (OR, 15.16; P <.001) admitted electively (OR, 2.19; P < .001) and evaluated with diagnostic imaging (OR, 10.63; P < .001) were more likely to receive LER.\nAfter controlling for comorbidities, minority patients, those with lower SES, and patients with Medicaid were more likely receive amputation for CLI in low-volume hospitals. Addressing SES and hospital factors may reduce amputation rates for CLI.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have focused on early outcomes of open (descending thoracic aortic repair [DTAR]) and endovascular (thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair [TEVAR]) repair of blunt aortic injury (blunt thoracic aortic injury [BTAI]). Late results remain ill-defined and are the focus of this study.\nOne hundred nine patients (1992-2010) underwent repair for BTAI. Mean age was 39.0 years (73.4% male). DTAR was performed in 90, with left heart bypass (85) or hypothermic arrest (5). TEVAR was used in 19 of 45 patients treated since 2002. A strategy of selective delayed repair has been used since 1997, with 54 of 75 patients treated with delayed repair in this interval. The primary outcome was vital status (100% follow-up; mean, 103.9 months).\nMean Injury Severity Score was 39.5. Thirty-day mortality was 4.6% (n = 5). Early morbidity included permanent spinal cord ischemia (SCI, 1.8%), stroke (2.8%), and need for permanent dialysis (1.8%). Independent predictors of a composite outcome of early mortality and these morbidities included age >60 years (odds ratio [OR], 8.4; P = .015), increasing preoperative creatinine (OR, 7.9; P = .017), and occurrence of postoperative sepsis (OR, 9.6; P = .021). Fifteen-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 81.3%. Independent predictors of late mortality included age >60 years (Cox hazard ratio [HR], 4.1; P = .01), increasing creatinine (HR, 9.1; P < .001), or occurrence of postoperative SCI (HR, 20.6; P < .001), but not repair type (P = .73). Endograft collapse occurred in one patient, necessitating reintervention. Freedom from aortic reintervention at 4 years was higher after open repair (DTAR 100% vs TEVAR 94%; P = .03).\nWith careful selection, open or endovascular repair of BTAI has excellent early and late results. Although TEVAR has an increased risk for reintervention, factors other than treatment strategy impact late survival. These data support the growing role of an endoluminal approach for BTAI in anatomically appropriate patients.",

    "abstract": "The coronary and extracranial carotid vascular beds are often simultaneously affected by significant atherosclerotic disease, and stroke is one of the potential major complications of coronary artery surgery. As a result, there is no shortage of reports in the vascular surgery literature describing simultaneous coronary and carotid artery revascularizations. Generally, these reports have found this combination of operations safe, but have stopped short of proving that it is necessary. Intuitively, simultaneous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass surgery could be justified if most perioperative strokes were the result of a significant carotid stenosis, either directly or indirectly. At first glance this appears to be a fairly straightforward issue; however, much of the evidence on both sides of the argument is circumstantial. One significant problem in analyzing outcome by choice of treatment in patients presenting with both coronary and carotid disease is the multiple potential causes of stroke in coronary bypass patients, which include hemorrhage and atheroemboli from aortic atheromas during clamping. But this controversial subject is now open to discussion, and our debaters have been given the challenge to clarify the evidence to justify their claims.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported the results of a dose-finding phase II trial showing that HGF angiogenic gene therapy can increase TcPO2 compared with placebo in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The purpose of this randomized placebo controlled multi-center trial was to further assess the safety and clinical efficacy of a modified HGF gene delivery technique in patients with CLI and no revascularization options.\nPatients with lower extremity ischemic tissue loss (Rutherford 5 and 6) received three sets of eight intramuscular injections every 2 weeks of HGF plasmid under duplex ultrasound guidance. Injection locations were individualized for each patient based on arteriographically defined vascular anatomy. Primary safety end point was incidence of adverse events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE). Clinical end points included change from baseline in toe brachial index (TBI), rest pain assessment by a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) as well as wound healing, amputation, and survival at 3 and 6 months.\nRandomization ratio was 3:1 HGF (n = 21) vs placebo (n = 6). Mean age was 76 \u00b1 2 years, with 56% male and 59% diabetic. There was no difference in demographics between groups. There was no difference in AEs or SAEs, which consisted mostly of transient injection site discomfort, worsening of CLI, and intercurrent illnesses. Change in TBI significantly improved from baseline at 6 months in the HGF-treated group compared with placebo (0.05 \u00b1 0.05 vs -0.17 \u00b1 0.04; P = .047). Change in VAS from baseline at 6 months was also significantly improved in the HGF-treated group compared with placebo (-1.9 \u00b1 1.3 vs +0.06 \u00b1 0.2; P = .04). Complete ulcer healing at 12 months occurred in 31% of the HGF group and 0% of the placebo (P = .28) There was no difference in major amputation of the treated limb (HGF 29% vs placebo 33%) or mortality at 12 months (HGF 19% vs placebo 17%) between groups.\nHGF gene therapy using a patient vascular anatomy specific delivery technique appears safe, maintained limb perfusion, and decreased rest pain in patients with CLI compared with placebo. A larger study to assess the efficacy of this therapy on more clinically relevant end points is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to assess the short- and long-term outcome for patients after carotid body tumor (CBT) resection and discuss the potential pitfalls of the treatment.\nAn analysis was undertaken of all patients who underwent CBT resection at Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and Greenslopes Private Hospital between 1982 and 2007. Primary tumor characteristics, surgical technique, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed.\nA total of 49 consecutive CBT resections (2 recurrent tumors) were carried out in 39 patients (26 women [56%]) who were a mean age of 49 years (range, 17-75 years). A nontender neck mass was the presenting complaint in 85%, followed by screening in familial or contralateral tumors in 26%. Familial cases occurred in 11 patients (28%). There were no operative deaths. Complications occurred in 13 of the 49 operations (27%), predominantly temporary nerve palsies and were more likely to occur in tumors of large volume or in cases of removal of coexisting vagal tumors. Malignant disease was present in seven cases (15%). All patients have been followed-up postoperatively for a mean of 11 years (range, 2-26 years). Metachronous paragangliomas have been discovered in six patients, all with familial disease.\nEarly resection of carotid body tumors should be undertaken while still small to minimize the risk of neural injury, which increases with tumor size. In cases of bilateral CBT, we recommend that the smaller tumor be resected first, before the staged resection of the larger contralateral tumor. In familial or bilateral tumor cases, other synchronous and metachronous paragangliomas should be excluded. Mandatory lifelong follow-up is essential.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the cerebrovascular risk stratification potential of baseline degree of stenosis, clinical features, and ultrasonic plaque characteristics in patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis.\nThis was a prospective, multicenter, cohort study of patients undergoing medical intervention for vascular disease. Hazard ratios for ICA stenosis, clinical features, and plaque texture features associated with ipsilateral cerebrovascular or retinal ischemic (CORI) events were calculated using proportional hazards models.\nA total of 1121 patients with 50% to 99% asymptomatic ICA stenosis in relation to the bulb (European Carotid Surgery Trial [ECST] method) were followed-up for 6 to 96 months (mean, 48). A total of 130 ipsilateral CORI events occurred. Severity of stenosis, age, systolic blood pressure, increased serum creatinine, smoking history of more than 10 pack-years, history of contralateral transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or stroke, low grayscale median (GSM), increased plaque area, plaque types 1, 2, and 3, and the presence of discrete white areas (DWAs) without acoustic shadowing were associated with increased risk. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for predicted risk versus observed CORI events as a measure of model validity. The areas under the ROC curves for a model of stenosis alone, a model of stenosis combined with clinical features and a model of stenosis combined with clinical, and plaque features were 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.64), 0.66 (0.62-0.72), and 0.82 (0.78-0.86), respectively. In the last model, stenosis, history of contralateral TIAs or stroke, GSM, plaque area, and DWAs were independent predictors of ipsilateral CORI events. Combinations of these could stratify patients into different levels of risk for ipsilateral CORI and stroke, with predicted risk close to observed risk. Of the 923 patients with \u2265 70% stenosis, the predicted cumulative 5-year stroke rate was <5% in 495, 5% to 9.9% in 202, 10% to 19.9% in 142, and \u2265 20% in 84 patients.\nCerebrovascular risk stratification is possible using a combination of clinical and ultrasonic plaque features.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the durability of adjunctive endovascular neck procedures, including aortic cuffs, Palmaz stents (Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla), and high-pressure balloon angioplasty, at managing intraoperative proximal neck complications during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThis was a single-center retrospective review of EVARs. The primary outcome variable studied was survival free of a graft-related event (GRE). GRE was defined by the occurrence of one of the following: type I endoleak, sac enlargement, aneurysm rupture, death, or procedure related to the aortic neck. These outcome variables were assessed relative to the preoperative anatomic neck variables (neck length, diameter, degree of angulation, degree of circumferential thrombus, and presence of conicity), procedural variables (manufacturing type of graft, use of a Palmaz stent), and patient characteristics (age and presence of medical comorbidities). Outcomes were assessed by t tests, Pearson \u03c7(2), and Kaplan-Meier analysis, when appropriate.\nA total of 174 EVARs performed between January 2005 and December 2007 were evaluated. Fifty-six adjunctive procedures were performed, with a 97% primary-assisted exclusion rate. Patients who received an adjunctive therapy had similar freedom from a GRE compared with EVARs that did not require adjunctive therapy (35.5 \u00b1 2.6 vs 34.8 \u00b1 1.5 months, P = .31, log-rank test). Subset analysis identified a significant association between Palmaz stent placement at the time of EVAR and decreased freedom from GREs (hazard ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-6.77; P = .02).\nMidterm results suggest that adjunctive therapies to manage intraoperative proximal neck complications do not compromise durability. The subset of patients requiring aortic neck Palmaz stent placement at the time of EVAR are among those at highest risk for subsequent GRE.",

Primary end points were patency and clinical outcome.\nSixty patients (26 men, mean age 43 years, range 16-81) underwent 64 procedures. Ninety-four percent had leg swelling, 90% had venous claudication, and 31% had active or healed ulcers (CEAP classes: C3 = 30, C4 = 12, C5 = 8, C6 = 12). Fifty-two OSRs included 29 femorofemoral (Palma vein: 25, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]: 4), 17 femoroiliac-inferior vena cava (IVC) (vein: 3, PTFE: 14) and six complex bypasses. Twelve patients had HR, which included endophlebectomy, patch angioplasty, and stenting. Early graft occlusion occurred after 17% of OSR and 33% HR. Discharge patency was 96% after OSR, 92% after HR. No mortality or pulmonary embolism occurred. Five-year primary and secondary patency was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29%-55%) and 59% (CI 43%-72%), respectively. For Palma vein grafts it was 70% and 78%, for femoroiliac and ilio-infrahepatic IVC bypasses it was 63% and 86%, and for femoro-infrahepatic IVC bypasses it was 31% and 57%, respectively. Complex OSRs and hybrid procedures had 28% and 30% 2-year secondary patency, respectively. The only factor that significantly affected graft patency in multivariate analysis was May-Thurner syndrome with associated chronic venous thrombosis. For HR, stenting into the common femoral vein patch vs iliac stents only significantly increased patency. At last follow-up, 60% of the patients had no venous claudication and no or minimal swelling. All ulcers with patent grafts healed but 50% of these recurred.\nBoth OSR and HR are viable options if endovascular procedures fail or are not feasible. Palma vein bypass and femoroiliac or iliocaval PTFE bypasses have excellent outcomes with good symptomatic relief.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the smooth muscle functional response and viability of human saphenous vein (HSV) grafts after harvest and explored the effect of mechanical stretch on contractile responses of porcine saphenous vein (PSV).\nThe contractile responses (stress, 10(5) N/m(2)) of deidentified, remnant HSV grafts to depolarizing potassium chloride and the agonist norepinephrine were measured in a muscle organ bath. Cellular viability was evaluated using a methyl thiazole tetrazolium (MTT) assay. A PSV model was used to evaluate the effect of radial, longitudinal, and angular stretch on smooth muscle contractile responses.\nContractile responses varied greatly in HSV harvested for autologous vascular and coronary bypass procedures (0.04198 \u00b1 0.008128 \u00d7 10(5) N/m(2) to 0.1192 \u00b1 0.02776 \u00d7 10(5) N/m(2)). Contractility of the HSV correlated with the cellular viability of the grafts. In the PSV model, manual radial distension of \u2265 300 mm Hg had no impact on the smooth muscle responses of PSV to potassium chloride. Longitudinal and angular stretch significantly decreased the contractile function of PSV by 33.16% and 15.26%, respectively (P < .03).\nThere is considerable variability in HSV harvested for use as an autologous conduit. Longitudinal and angular stretching during surgical harvest impairs contractile responsiveness of the smooth muscle in saphenous vein. Avoiding stretch-induced injuries to the conduits during harvest and preparation for implantation may reduce adverse biologic responses in the graft (eg, intimal hyperplasia) and improve patency of autologous vein graft bypasses.",

Patients from six centers that contributed most to the Dutch BOA Study (n = 482) were followed up retrospectively from 1995 up to 2009.\nAt a mean follow-up of 11 years since BOA randomization, 165 of the 482 patients were alive of whom 123 (75%) completed the EQ-5D and RAND-36 questionnaires. Fifty-three patients completed the questionnaires three times: at BOA entry, at BOA close-out, and at BOA long-term follow-up. In these patients the HR-QoL scores decreased over time, especially for the physical health dimension. In comparison with the general population, matched for age and gender, the HR-QoL scores at both BOA entry and long-term follow-up were substantially lower, even if the patient's graft was patent and no other vascular events had occurred. The occurrence of an adverse vascular event worsened the physical health state further.\nThe physical HR-QoL in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) after peripheral bypass surgery was highly impaired, independent of graft patency, and deteriorated further over time. An adverse vascular event worsened the physical health state and underlined the importance of atherosclerotic risk management as well as stimulation of physical activity in patients with peripheral arterial disease to preserve HR-QoL.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference in amputation-free survival and patency rates of infra-inguinal bypass grafts in patients with critical leg ischemia (CLI) with vein conduits with an internal diameter <3 mm compared to those with vein conduits with a diameter of \u2265 3 mm.\nRetrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with CLI undergoing infra-inguinal bypass. Preoperative duplex scan mapping and measurement of potential vein grafts were performed on all patients. Patients were recruited in a 1-year duplex scan graft surveillance program. Primary end points were amputation-free survival and patency rates at 1 year postoperatively. Kaplan-Meier and \u03c7(2) test were used for statistical analysis.\nBetween January 2004 and April 2010, 157 consecutive patients with CLI underwent 171 bypasses using vein conduits (111 men, 46 women; median age, 75 years; range, 45-96 years). Ninety-three bypasses (54.4%) were performed for tissue loss, 44 (25.7%) for gangrene, and for rest pain. Of the 157 patients, 113 (72.0%) had diabetes mellitus, 40 (25.5%) had renal impairment, 131 (83.4%) had hypertension, and 64 (40.8%) had ischemic heart disease. Femoro-popliteal bypass was performed in 38 cases (22.2%), whereas 133 (77.8%) of the bypasses were femoro-distal. Autogenous great saphenous vein (GSV) was used in all cases. All grafts were reversed. The diameter of 31 (18%) vein conduits measured <3 mm (range, 2-2.9 mm) on preoperative duplex scan. One hundred thirty-four grafts had at least 1-year follow-up. The primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates at 1 year for vein conduits <3 mm were 51.2%, 82.6%, and 82.6%, respectively, compared to 68.4%, 93.3%, and 95.2%, respectively, in the \u2265 3 mm group. This was only significant for the secondary patency (P = .0392). The amputation-free survival at 48 months was 70.8% for vein conduits <3 mm and 57.3 for vein conduits \u2265 3 mm.\nThis series has shown that primary and assisted primary patency rates in small veins are not significantly different at 1 year but the secondary patency rates are better in the larger veins. Similarly, the amputation-free survival was also comparable. The authors would, therefore, advocate the use of small veins >2 mm in diameter in patients with CLI. Duplex scan surveillance followed by early salvage angioplasty for threatened grafts is needed to achieve good patency rates in both groups.",

    "conclusions": "This series has shown that primary and assisted primary patency rates in small veins are not significantly different at 1 year but the secondary patency rates are better in the larger veins. Similarly, the amputation-free survival was also comparable. The authors would, therefore, advocate the use of small veins >2 mm in diameter in patients with CLI. Duplex scan surveillance followed by early salvage angioplasty for threatened grafts is needed to achieve good patency rates in both groups.",

Ninety-three bypasses (54.4%) were performed for tissue loss, 44 (25.7%) for gangrene, and for rest pain. Of the 157 patients, 113 (72.0%) had diabetes mellitus, 40 (25.5%) had renal impairment, 131 (83.4%) had hypertension, and 64 (40.8%) had ischemic heart disease. Femoro-popliteal bypass was performed in 38 cases (22.2%), whereas 133 (77.8%) of the bypasses were femoro-distal. Autogenous great saphenous vein (GSV) was used in all cases. All grafts were reversed. The diameter of 31 (18%) vein conduits measured <3 mm (range, 2-2.9 mm) on preoperative duplex scan. One hundred thirty-four grafts had at least 1-year follow-up. The primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates at 1 year for vein conduits <3 mm were 51.2%, 82.6%, and 82.6%, respectively, compared to 68.4%, 93.3%, and 95.2%, respectively, in the \u2265 3 mm group. This was only significant for the secondary patency (P = .0392). The amputation-free survival at 48 months was 70.8% for vein conduits <3 mm and 57.3 for vein conduits \u2265 3 mm.",

    "abstract": "Ethanol embolotherapy is one of the established methods in the treatment of extremity arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The purpose of this study was to report the application of this method to hand AVMs and to assess retrospectively the therapeutic outcomes and complications.\nFrom December 1998 to March 2009, we treated 31 patients with hand AVMs (16 women, 15 men, age range, 5-51 years; mean age, 27 years). With the patients under general anesthesia, they underwent staged ethanol embolotherapy (range, 1-11 sessions; mean, 2.8 sessions) by direct puncture and or intra-arterial approach. Therapeutic outcomes were evaluated by clinical responses of symptoms and signs, as well as the degree of devascularization on angiography. We also divided the patients into three groups according to the extent of involvement: a group involving fingers (n = 14), a group involving fingers and parts of the palm (n = 9), and a group involving parts of the palm (n = 8) and compared the therapeutic outcomes and complications among groups.\nOne patient (3%) was cured, 22 patients (73%) showed improvement, and 7 patients (23%) showed no change or aggravation after the treatment. One patient was lost to follow-up. Nineteen patients (61%) had one or more complications, including skin necrosis in 14 patients (45%), bullae in 7 patients (23%), joint stiffness or contracture in 6 patients (19%), and transient nerve palsy in 4 patients (13%). All of the complications were resolved completely after 1 to 8 months' (average, 3.4 months) follow-up, except in 2 patients who underwent amputation. According to the location of AVMs, rates of therapeutic benefit and complications were 93% and 64% in the group involving fingers, 38% and 78% in the group involving fingers and the palm, and 88% and 38% in the group involving the palm, respectively.\nEthanol embolotherapy of hand AVMs improves symptoms in a certain percentage of patients with a relatively high risk of complications. According to the extent of AVMs, there was a trend toward a higher complication rate in treatment of AVMs involving fingers and a lower rate of therapeutic benefit in AVMs involving both the fingers and the palm.",

    "abstract": "Studies analyzing the effects of volume on outcomes after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair have primarily centered on institutional volume and not on individual surgeon volume. We sought to determine the relative effects of both surgeon and institution volume on mortality after open and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for intact AAAs.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2007) was queried to identify all patients undergoing open repair and EVAR for nonruptured AAAs. To calculate surgeon and institution volume, 11 participating states that record a unique physician identifier for each procedure were included. Surgeon and institution volume were defined as low (first quintile), medium (second, third, or fourth quintile), and high (fifth quintile). Stratification by institution volume and then by surgeon volume was performed to analyze the primary endpoint: in-hospital mortality. Multivariable models were used to evaluate the association of institution and surgeon volume with mortality for open repair and EVAR, controlling for potential confounders.\nDuring the study period, 5972 open repairs and 8121 EVARs were performed. For open AAA repair, a significant mortality reduction was associated with both annual institution volume (low <7, medium 7-30, and high >30) and surgeon volume (low \u2264 2, medium 3-9, and high >9). High surgeon volume conferred a greater mortality reduction than did high institution volume. When low and medium volume institutions were stratified by surgeon volume, mortality after open AAA repair was inversely proportional to surgeon volume (8.7%, 3.6%, and 0%; P < .0001, for low, medium, and high-volume surgeons at low-volume institutions; and 6.7%, 4.8%, and 3.3%; P = .02, for low, medium, and high-volume surgeons at medium-volume institutions). High-volume institutions stratified by surgeon volume demonstrated the same trend (5.1%, 3.4%, and 2.8%), but this finding was not statistically significant (P = .57). Multivariable analysis was confirmatory: low surgeon volume independently predicted mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.1; P < .001); low institution volume did not (P = .1). For EVAR, neither institution volume nor surgeon volume influenced mortality (univariate or multivariable).\nThe primary factor driving the mortality reduction associated with case volume after open AAA repair is surgeon volume, not institution volume. Regionalization of AAAs should focus on open repair, as EVAR outcomes are equivalent across volume levels. Payers may need to re-evaluate strategies that encourage open AAA repair at high-volume institutions if specific surgeon volume is not considered.",

We sought to determine the long-term outcome of RAA repair performed with autogenous in situ techniques.\nThis was a cohort study of patients undergoing surgical repair of RAAs identified from our prospective vascular division registry (1984-2009).\nTwenty-six RAAs were repaired in 24 patients (17 women, 7 men; mean age, 52 \u00b1 16 years). Mean size was 2.3 \u00b1 0.7 cm (range, 0.7-4.0 cm). Twenty RAAs were repaired based on size and six for hypertension alone. Multiple RAAs were present in 13 patients (54%). Associated conditions included hypertension in 24 (100%), fibromuscular dysplasia in 6 (25%), coexistent renal artery stenosis in 6 (25%), and aortic aneurysm in 3 (12.5%). Reconstruction of first- or second-order branches was required in 25 RAAs (96%). In situ techniques were used in 22 repairs and included resection combined with autogenous vein bypass and interposition in 11, primary anastomosis to conjoined outflow vessels in 3, and aortic reimplantation in 2. Aneurysmorrhaphy was combined with vein patch angioplasty in 6, exclusion in 2, tailored primary closure in 1, and autogenous bypass in 1. Four patients underwent ex vivo reconstruction. Perioperative mortality was 0% and morbidity was 11.5%, including one nephrectomy during ex vivo repair for immediate thrombosis. Renal function was preserved (preoperative creatinine, 0.94 \u00b1 0.3 vs postoperative creatinine 1.06 \u00b1 0.4 mg/dL; P = .11). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control improved after operation: preoperative SBP 142 \u00b1 18 vs postoperative SBP 130 \u00b1 15 mm Hg (P = .007) and preoperative DBP 86 \u00b1 14 vs postoperative DBP 78 \u00b1 10 mm Hg (P = .01). Long-term patency was evaluated in 18 reconstructions (69%) by duplex imaging or contrast radiography at an average long-term follow-up of 99 months (range, 1-300 months) and was 94%. Five-year freedom from rupture and survival by the Kaplan-Meier method was 100%.\nIn situ techniques allow repair of complex RAAs involving branch vessels with minimal morbidity, improved blood pressure control, and maintenance of renal function. This operative approach further provides excellent long-term patency and survival in this relatively young patient population.",

In contrast, the non-endothelialized areas of bare metal stents and glutin/poly-L-lysine-coated stents were covered at 4 weeks, and the monolayers of cells were not observed, but fragile neointima was found on the surface. After 12 weeks, VEGF(121)-transfected HUVECs-coated stents significantly reduced the neointima area (0.78 \u00b1 0.03 mm(2)) and stenosis (15.69 \u00b1 2.61%) as compared with those for bare metal stents (neointima area = 2.26 \u00b1 0.67 mm(2); the percentage of stenosis = 47.55 \u00b1 7.10%;P < .01) and glutin/poly-L-lysine-coated stents (neointima area = 1.40 \u00b1 0.37 mm(2); the percentage of stenosis = 31.37 \u00b1 8.18%;P < .01).\nIn this small animal study, VEGF transfected human endothelial cells, when coated on stainless steel stents, reduce neointimal hyperplasia, promote endothelialization, and reduce in-stent restenosis. Additional studies with this technology are necessary to determine its ultimate utility in improving stents performance.",

    "abstract": "Serial computed tomography (CT) scanning is routinely used to follow up endovascular exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Nonvascular diseases can be identified, and these exams include images of the lung bases, which can provide information that leads to the diagnosis of pulmonary neoplasms. This study was conducted to determine the rate and type of pulmonary-based oncologic diseases identified by serial CT scanning of patients with endovascular repair of AAAs.\nA retrospective review of 138 consecutive patients receiving endovascular AAA exclusion during an 8-year period was performed. Length of follow-up and number of CT scans performed was recorded. CT characteristics of the lesion (size, character, and suspicion of malignancy), type of biopsy procedure performed, and final pathologic diagnosis were collected. Oncologic treatments and survival length were also evaluated.\nPulmonary lesions were found in 25 patients (18%), of whom 5 (4%) died during follow-up, and 13 (9%) had stable, subcentimeter lesions and continue to have surveillance from vascular specialists only. Seven patients (5%) with pulmonary lesions were referred for evaluation by thoracic surgeons. Six patients (4%) underwent biopsy of the lesion and were diagnosed with cancer. One patient refused a biopsy and is being monitored with serial CT scans. Four lung cancers (1 small cell and 3 non-small cell), one primary pulmonary carcinoid tumor, and one B-cell lymphoma were discovered. No changes were noted in the lesions in the patient receiving CT surveillance. More than half of the cancers were diagnosed in stage I, with a mean lesion diameter of 11 mm at biopsy. Of 25 patients with pulmonary nodules, 24 were men. The patients diagnosed with cancer are all still alive, with a mean survival length of 2.5 years (range, 0.5-6 years) after oncologic treatment.\nSerial CT scans may reveal a high rate of pulmonary malignancies in a population with AAAs. Attention to the incidental finding of pulmonary nodules on CT scans and arrangement of appropriate follow-up by the vascular surgeon is important for patients undergoing surveillance after endovascular AAA repair. These results indicate that aggressive management of these lesions (early thoracic surgery consultation and biopsy) is appropriate in this high-risk population and may offer early diagnosis and improved long-term survival.",

    "abstract": "Repeat percutaneous endoluminal interventions for femoropopliteal occlusive disease are common, but the outcomes are poorly understood. We sought to determine the results of second-time femoropopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting (SPTAS) and identify factors associated with success or failure of a continued endoluminal revascularization strategy.\nA retrospective review of patients undergoing multiple percutaneous endoluminal lower extremity interventions at a single institution from 2002 and 2009 identified 70 SPTAS in 70 limbs. Patient comorbidities, anatomic severity of disease, and procedural characteristics were analyzed with respect to outcomes with descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Patency rates were determined from the time of SPTAS.\nPatients included 37 men (63%) and 22 women (27%) at a mean age of 70 \u00b1 10 years. Indications for SPTAS included claudication in 54 limbs (77%) and critical limb ischemia (CLI) in 16 (23%). Median time from the initial endoluminal intervention to SPTAS was 330 days. Lesion TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus II (TASCII) classification was A in 18 (25.7%), B in 18 (25.7%), C in 25 (35.7%), and D in 9 (12.9%). Technical success was achieved in 68 (97%) with low rates of intraprocedural (10%) and postprocedural (4%) complications as well as initial clinical improvement in 61 (87%) patients. Over a median follow-up of 22.9 months following SPTAS, 2-year primary patency, secondary patency, limb salvage (in patients with CLI), and survival were 33% \u00b1 7%, 63% \u00b1 7%, 87% \u00b1 9%, and 88% \u00b1 5%, respectively. Cox proportional hazard modeling showed that SPTAS within 180 days of the initial endovascular intervention was the only significant predictor of failure of primary patency (hazard ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.2) and secondary patency (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-7.1) of SPTAS.\nSecond-time femoropopliteal angioplasty/stenting has excellent technical success but limited midterm primary and secondary patency. Early failure of the initial endovascular intervention strongly predicts poor outcome following SPTAS and in this cohort was more significant than comorbidities, anatomic factors, or procedural characteristics. These data suggest that after early endovascular failure, alternatives to a continued endoluminal strategy should be adopted.",

    "abstract": "Venous hypertension is a significant cause of patient morbidity and decreased quality of life. Common etiologies of venous hypertension include deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or congenital abnormalities resulting in chronic outflow obstruction. We have implemented an aggressive endovascular approach for the treatment of iliac venous occlusion with angioplasty and stenting. The purpose of this study was to determine the patency rates with this approach at a large tertiary care center.\nAll patients undergoing iliofemoral venous angioplasty and stenting over a 4-year period were identified from a vascular surgical registry. Charts were reviewed retrospectively for patient demographics, the extent of venous system involvement, the time course of the venous pathology, and any underlying cause. Technical aspects of the procedure including previous angioplasty or stenting attempts and presence of collaterals on completion venogram were then recorded. Patency upon follow-up was determined using primarily ultrasound scans; other imaging methods were used if patency was not clear using an ultrasound scan.\nA total of 36 patients (40 limbs) were stented from January 2005 through December 2008. Of these patients, 27 were women (75%). Both lower extremities were involved in 4 patients. Thrombolysis was performed in 19 patients (52.8%). Thrombosis was considered acute (<30 days) in 13 patients (38%). The majority of patients who had a recognized underlying etiology were diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome (15 patients; 42%). In 9 patients, an etiology was not determined (25%). The mean follow-up time period in the study population was 10.5 months. One stent in the study occluded acutely and required restenting. Primary patency rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were 88% (75.2-100), 78.3% (61.1-95.4), and 78.3% (61.1-95.4), respectively. Secondary patency rates for the same time frames were 100% (100.0, 100.0), 95% (85.4, 100.0), and 95% (85.4, 100.0). Better outcomes were seen in stenting for May-Thurner syndrome and idiopathic causes, whereas external compression and thrombophilia seemed to portend less favorable outcomes (P < .001). Symptomatic improvement was reported in 24 of 29 patients (83%) contacted by telephone follow-up.\nIliofemoral venous stenting provides a safe and effective option for the treatment of iliac venous occlusive disease. Acceptable patency rates can be expected through short-term follow-up, especially in the case of May-Thurner syndrome. Further experience with this approach and longer-term follow-up is necessary. Thrombophilia workup should be pursued aggressively in this population, and further studies should be undertaken to determine the optimal length of anticoagulation therapy after stent placement.",

    "abstract": "Distal embolization (DE) during percutaneous lower extremity revascularization (LER) may cause severe clinical sequelae. To better define DE, we investigated which lesion types and treatment modalities increase the risk for embolization.\nA prospective registry of LER from 2004 to 2009 was reviewed. All cases with runoff evaluated before and after intervention were included. Angiograms and operative reports were reviewed for evidence of DE. Interventions included percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), with or without stent placement, and atherectomy with four different devices. Chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test were used to assess significance. Patency rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank analysis.\nThere were 2137 lesions treated in 1029 patients. The embolization rate was 1.6% (34 events). Jetstream (Pathway, Kirkland, Wash) and DiamondBack 360 (Cardiovascular Systems Inc, St Paul Minn) devices had a combined embolization rate of 22% (8 of 36), 4 of 18 (22%) in each group, which was significantly higher than with PTA alone (5 of 570, 0.9%), PTA and stent (5 of 740, 0.7%), SilverHawk (ev3, Plymouth, Minn) atherectomy (14 of 736, 1.9%), and laser atherectomy (2 of 55, 3.6%; P < .001). There was a significantly higher rate of embolization for in-stent restenosis (6 of 188, 3.2%) and chronic total occlusions (15 of 615, 2.4%) compared with stenotic lesions (13 of 1334, 0.9%; P = .01). The embolization rate was significantly higher in Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II C and D lesions compared with TASC A and B lesions (P = .018). DE rates were not affected by preoperative runoff status (P = .152). Patency was restored at the completion of the procedure in 32 of 34 cases of DE. The 24-month primary patency, assisted primary patency, and secondary patency in the DE group was 54.0% \u00b1 11.9%, 70.0% \u00b1 10.3%, and 73.2% \u00b1 10.3%, respectively, and was 44.4% \u00b1 1.7%, 61.5% \u00b1 1.7%, and 68.2% \u00b1 1.6%, respectively, when embolization did not occur (P > .05). Limb salvage was 72.6% \u00b1 3.1% in lesions in which no DE occurred vs 83.3% \u00b1 15.2% in lesions in which DE occurred (P = .699).\nDE is a rare event that occurs more often with the Jetstream and DiamondBack 360 devices. In-stent and complex native lesions are at higher risk for DE. DE is typically reversible with endovascular techniques and has no effect on patency rates and limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the safety and benefit of urgent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with carotid disease and an acute stable neurologic event.\nThe study involved patients with acute neurologic impairment, defined as \u2265 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) evaluation related to a carotid stenosis \u2265 50% who underwent urgent CEA. Preoperative workup included neurologic assessment with the NIHSS on admission or immediately before surgery and at discharge, carotid duplex scanning, transcranial Doppler ultrasound imaging, and head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. End points were perioperative (30-day) neurologic mortality, significant NIHSS score improvement or worsening (defined as a variation \u2265 4), and hemorrhagic or ischemic neurologic recurrence. Patients were evaluated according to their NIHSS score on admission (4-7 or \u2265 8), clinical and demographic characteristics, timing of surgery (before or after 6 hours), and presence of brain infarction on neuroimaging.\nBetween January 2005 and December 2009, 62 CEAs were performed at a mean of 34.2 \u00b1 50.2 hours (range, 2-280 hours) after the onset of symptoms. No neurologic mortality nor significant NIHSS score worsening was detected. The NIHSS score decreased in all but four patients, with no new ischemic lesions detected. The mean NIHSS score was 7.05 \u00b1 3.41 on admission and 3.11 \u00b1 3.62 at discharge in the entire group (P < .01). Patients with an NIHSS score of \u2265 8 on admission had a bigger score reduction than those with a lower NIHSS score (NIHSS 4-7; mean 4.95 \u00b1 1.03 preoperatively vs 1.31 \u00b1 1.7 postoperatively, NIHSS \u2265 8 10.32 \u00b1 1.94 vs 4.03 \u00b1 3.67; P < .001).\nIn patients with acute neurologic event, a high NIHSS score does not contraindicate early surgery. To date, guidelines recommend treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis \u2264 2 weeks from onset of symptoms to minimize the neurologic recurrence. Our results suggest that minimizing the time for intervention not only reduces the risk of recurrence but can also improve neurologic outcome.",

CcTIA patients operated in the acute phase were those who had experienced \u2265 two cerebral TIAs and had been consecutively operated within 2 weeks of their first-ever TIA. Clinical assessment was by the vascular neurologist. Duplex ultrasonography was initially used for the diagnosis of severe (>70%) ipsilateral internal carotid artery and further assessed by magnetic resonance angiography and/or computed tomography angiography. Brain damage was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or at default computed tomography scan. Perioperative medical treatment and operative techniques were standardized. Stroke, death, and major cardiac events were analyzed.\nSixty-four patients sustained a median of four cerebral TIAs. Median delay to surgery from initial examination was 5 days. The mean degree of internal carotid artery stenosis was 87.9%. Of the 55 patients who had magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging, 43 (78%) patients had new acute infarction in an area that corresponded to the clinical symptoms. All patients received antiplatelet therapy and statin during the intervening period. All patients underwent conventional carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with patch angioplasty (polytetrafluoroethylene). Fifty-six patients (87.5%) underwent CEA under local anesthesia with two (3.5%) utilizing selective shunting, and eight patients had general anesthesia with systematic shunting. From CEA to discharge, all patients had complete recovery of their unstable clinical syndrome. At discharge and at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, no stroke or death, or major cardiac event occurred in this series with a 100% complete follow-up.\nShort delay between symptom onset and neurological assessment, immediate start of secondary stroke prevention, optimal perioperative medical treatment, and standardized operative techniques enabled performance of CEA in the acute phase of CcTIAs with low combined risk of stroke, death, and major cardiac event.",

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic aortic injury (TAI) refers to a spectrum of pathology that ranges from intimal tears to aortic rupture. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been widely used as a diagnostic tool in this setting. Additional imaging is required when CTA studies are equivocal. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) versus angiography in the diagnosis of TAI.\nWe performed an analysis of prospectively collected trauma registry data. CTA was used as the initial screening test. Patients with a positive or equivocal CTA underwent angiography and IVUS. Injuries were classified into Grades 1 to 4 (intimal tear, intramural hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and rupture). Patients with Grade 1 injuries were managed medically. Patients with Grade 2 to 4 injuries underwent repair. A blinded randomized retrospective review of positive and equivocal imaging studies was performed. Standard screening test assessments (sensitivity, specificity), inter-rater agreement (Kappa), and frequency (Chi-square for the difference) were computed to evaluate the measurement characteristics of the multiple imaging techniques.\nBetween May 2008 and August 2009, 7961 patients were admitted to our trauma center, and 2153 (27%) underwent a chest CTA. Twenty-five (0.3%) patients (21 males, mean age 21.9 years) had a positive or equivocal study for TAI. The mean Injury Severity Score was 33.9. Ten patients underwent repair (nine endovascular, one open), and 15 patients were managed medically. The 30-day mortality, paraplegia, and stroke rates were zero. Equivocal results were more common with CTA images than with either IVUS or angiography (27% vs 2.5 and 5%, respectively; overall P = .0002). Compared with angiography, IVUS changed the diagnosis in 13% of cases; identifying injuries in 11% and ruling them out in 2%. Sensitivity and specificity of angiography with respect to IVUS was 38% and 89%, respectively.\nCTA is useful as a screening test in suspected TAI. When additional imaging is required after an equivocal CTA, IVUS is better than angiography. Therefore, we advocate the use of IVUS in potential TAI patients in whom angiography is being considered.",

Ten patients underwent repair (nine endovascular, one open), and 15 patients were managed medically. The 30-day mortality, paraplegia, and stroke rates were zero. Equivocal results were more common with CTA images than with either IVUS or angiography (27% vs 2.5 and 5%, respectively; overall P = .0002). Compared with angiography, IVUS changed the diagnosis in 13% of cases; identifying injuries in 11% and ruling them out in 2%. Sensitivity and specificity of angiography with respect to IVUS was 38% and 89%, respectively.",

The primary interventions are prevention and treatment, both of which many vascular specialists may not always recognize. We review the definition, epidemiology, the basic pathophysiology, and preventative management for postthrombotic syndrome. The current primary medical and interventional treatment modalities to decrease the occurrence of postthrombotic syndrome are also highlighted. Many of these treatments are currently available and simply need to be adhered to, whereas others are a shift in the paradigm, focusing on active thrombus removal.",

    "abstract": "Current data suggest microembolization to the brain may result in long-term cognitive dysfunction despite the absence of immediate clinically obvious cerebrovascular events. We reviewed a series of patients treated electively with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid artery stenting (CAS) with distal filters, and carotid stenting with flow reversal (FRS) monitored continuously with transcranial Doppler scan (TCD) during the procedure to detect microembolization rates.\nTCD insonation of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery was conducted during 42 procedures (15 CEA, 20 CAS, and 7 FRS) in 41 patients seen at an academic center. One patient had staged bilateral CEA. Ipsilateral microembolic signals (MESs) were divided into three phases: preprotection phase (until internal carotid artery [ICA] cross-shunted or clamped if no shunt was used, filter deployed, or flow reversal established), protection phase (until clamp/shunt was removed, filter removed, or antegrade flow re-established), and postprotection phase (after clamp/shunt was removed, filter removed, or antegrade flow re-established). Descriptive statistics are reported as mean \u00b1 SE for continuous variables and N (%) for categorical variables. Differences in ipsilateral emboli counts based on cerebral protection strategy were assessed using nonparametric methods.\nTCD insonation and procedural success were obtained in 33 procedures (79%; 14 CEA, 14 CAS, and 5 FRS). Highest ipsilateral MESs were observed for CAS (319.3 \u00b1 110.3), followed by FRS (184.2 \u00b1 110.5), and CEA (15.3 \u00b1 22.0). Pairwise comparisons revealed significantly higher ipsilateral MESs with both FRS and CAS when compared to CEA (P = .007 for FRS and P < .001 for CAS vs CEA, respectively), whereas the difference in MESs between FRS and CAS was not significant (P = .053). Periods of maximum embolization were postprotection phase for CEA, protection phase for CAS, and preprotection phase for FRS. Preprotection MESs were frequently observed during both CAS and FRS (20.4% and 63.3% of total MESs across all phases, respectively), and the primary difference between these two methods seemed to be related to lower MESs during the protection phase with FRS.\nCEA is associated with lower rates of microembolization compared with carotid stenting. Flow reversal may represent a procedural modification with potential to reduce microembolization during carotid stenting; further investigation is warranted to determine the relationship between cerebral protection strategies and outcomes associated with carotid stenting.",

The CBCT-fusion group was comprised of patients who underwent preprocedural CBCT to guide FEVAR using fusion imaging with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). The postprocedure CBCT group consisted of patients undergoing CBCT following deployment of the endograft. Outcomes from the CBCT-fusion group were compared with historical controls. These controls were patients who underwent FEVAR for similar groups of abdominal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in the 12 months preceding the initiation of a CBCT program. The findings on postprocedural CBCT were compared with those on predischarge MDCT. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1standard error of the mean, or as median and interquartile range.\nForty patients were included in the \"CBCT-fusion\" group and compared with the historical cohort. The use of perioperative guidance of FEVAR by means of CBCT resulted in a significantly lower contrast dose (94 cc [72-131] vs 136 cc [96-199]; P = .001). While there was a trend toward lower operative (330 minutes [273-522] vs 387 minutes [290-477]; P = .651) and fluoroscopy times (81 min [54-118] vs 90 minutes (46-128), P = .932); this difference did not reach statistical significance. Nineteen patients were included in the \"postprocedural CBCT\" group and compared with predischarge MDCT. Postoperative CBCT identified eight endoleaks. Type I and III (n = 6) endoleaks were identified and treated during the primary procedure. When CBCT did not show an endoleak, this was confirmed by MDCT. The use of CBCT required significantly less contrast compared to MDCT (50 cc [set amount] vs 100 cc [80-125]; P < .0001). Mean skin dose was 0.27 (0.011) Gy for preoperative CBCT and 0.552 (0.036) Gy for postoperative CBCT.\nCBCT is a valuable addition to complicated aortic interventions such as FEVAR. Intraoperative use utilizing fusion imaging limits contrast dosage and postdeployment CBCT is of sufficient quality to evaluate successful aneurysm exclusion and for detection of early complications after FEVAR. With the information we are able to obtain from the CBCT at the completion of the FEVAR, we can intervene on problems earlier and potentially decrease the subsequent need for reintervention.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are the preferred choice for hemodialysis vascular access (AV access); however, there is debate over the utility of AVFs in older patients, particularly concerning access maturation and functionality. We reviewed our AV access experience in patients \u226565 years of age.\nWe analyzed consecutive AV access patients \u226565 years old with access operations between March 2003 and December 2009. All patients had ultrasound vessel mapping. In addition to overall outcomes review, the data for patients \u226565 years old were stratified into three 10-year increments by age for further analysis. We compared functional patency data for our older patients with those of our non-elderly patients aged 21 to 64 years treated during the same time period.\nFour hundred sixty-one consecutive AV access patients new to our practice were included in this study. Ages were 65 to 94 years (mean, 73 years). Two hundred thirty-six (51.2%) were female, 276 (59.9%) patients were diabetic, and 103 (22.3%) were obese. One hundred seven (23.2%) patients had previous access operations. Radiocephalic AVFs were constructed in 29 (6.3%) patients, 99 (21.5%) patients had brachial artery inflow AVFs, 330 (71.6%) had proximal radial artery AVFs, and three were based on the femoral artery. Transposition AVFs were used in 124 (26.9%) patients. No grafts were used for AV access in any patient during the study period. Time to AVF use was 0.5 to 6 months (mean, 1.5 months). Primary, primary assisted, and cumulative patency for patients aged 65 to 94 years were 59.9%, 93.7%, and 96.9% at 12 months and 45.3%, 90.1%, and 94.6% at 24 months, respectively.

In addition, the relationship between different outcome measures is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to compare anatomical, hemodynamic, and clinical outcomes with disease-specific quality-of-life tools in patients undergoing treatment for varicose veins.\nPatients undergoing treatment for symptomatic veins in a single unit were studied. Assessments included duplex ultrasonography, digital photoplethysmography, evaluation of Venous Clinical Severity Scores and CEAP scores, generic (Short Form 12 [SF12]) and disease-specific (Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire [AVVQ], and Specific Quality-of-life and Outcome Response-Venous [SQOR-V]) questionnaires. Patients were reviewed at 6 weeks when hemodynamic, clinical, and quality-of-life assessments were repeated. The relationships between these outcomes were assessed.\nThe AVVQ showed a strong positive correlation with the SQOR-V (Spearman coefficient 0.702; P < .001) and weaker, but significant correlations with the SF12 physical and mental component scores and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (P < .001, P = .019, and P < .001, respectively, Spearman correlation). No correlations were observed between the AVVQ and photoplethysmography results (Spearman coefficient -0.042; P = .606), and weak correlations were observed with the AVVQ and anatomical reflux. At 6 weeks, functional, clinical, and hemodynamic measurements were all responsive to changes following interventions; however, correlations observed between changes in disease-specific quality-of-life and generic, clinical, and hemodynamic outcomes were weak.\nBoth the AVVQ and SQOR-V questionnaire are sensitive and responsive disease-specific questionnaires, which correlate with generic and clinical outcomes to some extent.

    "abstract": "Patient-specific virtual reality (VR) simulation is a technologic advancement that allows planning and practice of the carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedure before it is performed on the patient. The initial findings are reported, using this novel VR technique as a tool to optimize technical and nontechnical aspects of this complex endovascular procedure.\nIn the angiography suite, the same interventional team performed the VR rehearsal and the actual CAS on the patient. All proceedings were recorded to allow for video analysis of team, technical, and nontechnical skills.\nAnalysis of both procedures showed identical use of endovascular tools, similar access strategy, and a high degree of similarity between the angiography images. The total procedure time (24.04 vs 60.44 minutes), fluoroscopy time (11.19 vs 21.04 minutes), and cannulation of the common carotid artery (1.35 vs 9.34) took considerably longer in reality. An extensive questionnaire revealed that all team members found that the rehearsal increased the subjective sense of teamwork (4/5), communication (4/5), and patient safety (4/5).\nA VR procedure rehearsal is a practical and feasible preparatory tool for CAS and shows a high correlation with the real procedure. It has the potential to enhance the technical, nontechnical, and team performance. Further research is needed to evaluate if this technology can lead to improved outcomes for patients.",

    "abstract": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement criteria for carotid artery stenting (CAS) require that patients be high surgical risk or enrolled in a clinical trial. This may bias comparisons of CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We evaluate mortality and stroke following CAS and CEA stratified by medical high risk criteria.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2004-2007) was queried by ICD-9 code for CAS and CEA with diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis. Medical high risk criteria were identified for each patient including patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass and/or valve repair (CABG/V) during the same admission. Symptom status was defined by history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and/or amarosis fugax. The primary outcome was postoperative death, stroke (complication code 997.02), and combined stroke or death, stratified by high risk vs non-high risk status and symptom status.\nPatient totals of 56,564 (10.5%) CAS and 482,394 (89.5%) CEA were identified. Half of the patients in each group were high risk. CABG/V was performed less commonly with CAS than CEA (2.8% vs 4.0%, P < .001). Patients undergoing CAS were more likely symptomatic than those undergoing CEA (13.1% vs 9.4%, P < .001). Mortality was higher after CAS than CEA for both high risk and non-high risk patients. Stroke was also higher after CAS for both high risk and non-high risk patients. Combined stroke or death was higher after CAS again for both high risk (asymptomatic 1.5% vs 1.2%, P < .05, symptomatic 14.4% vs 6.9%, P < .001) and non-high risk (asymptomatic 1.8% vs 0.6%, P < .001, symptomatic 11.8% vs 4.9%, P < .001). Combined stroke or death for patients undergoing CABG/V during the same admission was similar for CAS and CEA (4.8% vs 3.2%, P = .19). Multivariate predictors of combined stroke or death adjusted for age and gender included CAS vs CEA (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, P < .001), symptom status (OR 6.8, P < .001), high risk (OR 1.6, P < .001), and earlier year of procedure (OR 1.1, P < .01).\nIn the United States from 2004 to 2007, CAS has a higher risk of stroke and death than CEA after adjustment for medical high risk criteria. Further analysis with prospective assessment of risk factors is needed to guide appropriate patient selection for CEA and CAS in the general population.",

    "abstract": "The present study was aimed at developing a new cell-permeant peptide inhibitor (MK2i) of the kinase that phosphorylates and activates heat-shock protein (HSP)27 (MAPKAP kinase II), and evaluating the ability of this peptide to inhibit HSP27 phosphorylation and intimal thickening.\nThe ability of MK2i to reduce HSP27 phosphorylation and cell migration was evaluated in A7R5 cells stimulated with arsenite or lysophosphatidic acid. Stable isotopic labeling using amino acids in cell culture, in combination with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, was used to characterize the effect of MK2i on global protein expression in fibroblasts. The effect of MK2i on intimal thickening and connective tissue growth factor expression was evaluated in human saphenous vein (HSV) rings maintained with 30% fetal bovine serum for 14 days by light microscopy and immunoblotting.\nPretreatment of cells with MK2i (10 \u03bcM) prior to arsenite or lysophosphatidic acid stimulation decreased phosphorylation of HSP27 (36% \u00b1 9% and 33% \u00b1 10%, respectively) compared with control (not pretreated) cells. MK2i also inhibited A7R5 migration, and downregulated the transforming growth factor-induced expression of collagen and fibronectin in keloid cells, two major matrix proteins involved in the development of intimal hyperplasia. Treatment of HSV segments with MK2i enhanced relaxation, reduced HSP27 phosphorylation (40% \u00b1 17%), connective tissue growth factor expression (17% \u00b1 5%), and intimal thickness (48.2% \u00b1 10.5%) compared with untreated segments. On the other hand, treatment with a recombinant fusion protein containing a cell-permeant peptide attached to the HSP27 sequence increased intimal thickness of HSV segments by 48% \u00b1 14%.\nOur results suggest that HSP27 may play a role in the development of processes leading to intimal hyperplasia in HSV, and reduction of HSP27 phosphorylation by MK2i may be a potential strategy to inhibit the development of intimal hyperplasia in HSV to prevent the autologous vascular graft failure.",

Neurological investigation proved negative and a 24-hour Holter monitoring device revealed significant nocturnal cardiac pauses. As such, a pacemaker was implanted in the patient, which was effective at preventing the syncopes. A subsequent investigation led to the undertaking of a cervical computed tomography (CT) scan that showed the existence of a right carotid body tumor. Rotational flexing or stretching of the neck immediately triggered the start of the pacemaker. The tumor was surgically removed and the patient no longer felt the activation of the pacemaker, which was removed 6 months after the operation. One year later, the patient was found to be well and completely free of her previous symptoms.",

    "abstract": "To compare articulated and nonarticulated early walking aids (EWAs) for clinical and quality-of-life outcomes in transtibial amputees.\nPatients undergoing lower limb amputation in a tertiary-care vascular surgical unit were screened over a 4-year period. Recruited patients were randomized to receive articulated amputee mobility aid (AMA) or nonarticulated pneumatic postamputation mobility aid (PPAMA) during early rehabilitation. Primary (10-meter walking velocity) and secondary clinical (number and duration of physiotherapy treatments during EWA/prosthesis use) and quality-of-life (SF-36) outcome measures were recorded at five standardized assessment visits. Inter-group and intra-group analyses were performed.\nTwo hundred seventy-two patients were screened and 29 transtibial amputees (median age, 56 years) were recruited (14/treatment arm). No significant difference was seen in demographics and comorbidities at baseline. Inter-group analysis: Median 10-meter walking velocity was significantly (Mann-Whitney, P = .020) faster in the PPAMA group (0.245 m/s, interquartile range [IQR] 0.218-0.402 m/s) compared with the AMA group (0.165 m/s; IQR, 0.118-0.265 m/s) at visit 1. However, there was no difference between the groups at any other visit. Similarly, the number of treatments using EWA was significantly (P = .045) lower in the PPAMA group (5.0; IQR, 3.5-8.0) compared with the AMA group (6.0; IQR, 6.0-10.5). No difference was observed between the groups in duration of physiotherapy or SF-36 domain and summary scores. Intra-group analysis: Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in 10-meter walking velocity (Friedman test; AMA P = .001; PPAMA P = .007); however, other clinical outcomes did not show any statistically significant improvement. Only physical function domain of SF-36 demonstrated significant improvement (Friedman test; AMA P = .037; PPAMA P = .029).\nThere is no difference in clinical and QOL outcomes between articulated and nonarticulated EWAs in rehabilitation of transtibial amputees.",

Inter-group analysis: Median 10-meter walking velocity was significantly (Mann-Whitney, P = .020) faster in the PPAMA group (0.245 m/s, interquartile range [IQR] 0.218-0.402 m/s) compared with the AMA group (0.165 m/s; IQR, 0.118-0.265 m/s) at visit 1. However, there was no difference between the groups at any other visit. Similarly, the number of treatments using EWA was significantly (P = .045) lower in the PPAMA group (5.0; IQR, 3.5-8.0) compared with the AMA group (6.0; IQR, 6.0-10.5). No difference was observed between the groups in duration of physiotherapy or SF-36 domain and summary scores. Intra-group analysis: Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in 10-meter walking velocity (Friedman test; AMA P = .001; PPAMA P = .007); however, other clinical outcomes did not show any statistically significant improvement. Only physical function domain of SF-36 demonstrated significant improvement (Friedman test; AMA P = .037; PPAMA P = .029).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) has been attempted for acute aortic emergencies (AAEs). However, the risk factors for achieving good results have not been identified. Besides focusing on Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score as a general indicator of patient condition, we analyzed both preoperative factors and intraoperative/postoperative factors. The purpose of this study was to identify those factors affecting the results of TEVAR using our Matsui-Kitamura stent graft (MKSG) for AAEs involving descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.\nBetween July 2000 and June 2008, a total of 32 patients (23 men, 9 women) with AAEs underwent endovascular repair. AAE was a result of aortic aneurysm rupture in 16 cases, rupture of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer in 2 cases, traumatic aortic injury in 9 cases, complicated type B dissection in 4 cases, and aortic infiltration of sarcoma in 1 case. Low blood pressure in 6 patients, acute renal failure in 7 patients, anemia due to bleeding in 12 patients were found at the time of operation. Urgent TEVAR using the MKSG was performed. Perioperative and long-term results for these patients were investigated.\nThe delivery and technical success rate for TEVAR using the MKSG, was 100%. Perioperative mortality was 12.5%, and 5-year survival rate was 71%. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, the APACHE II score clarified a risk factor. Among the various elements of an APACHE II score, age, hematocrit, and total score were identified as significant factors. The mean of an APACHE II score was 9.5. Patients with an APACHE II score \u2265 10 showed significantly lower 5-year survival rates than patients with an APACHE II score \u2264 9.\nGood results were obtained using TEVAR to treat AAEs with MKSGs, both perioperatively and during medium-term follow-up. Evaluation of risk factors for TEVAR of AAEs showed the utility of APACHE II score (particularly age, hematocrit, and total score) with a score \u2265 10 indicating high risk.",

    "abstract": "Inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) can prevent pulmonary embolism (PE); however, indications for use vary. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) 2002 guidelines suggest prophylactic IVCF use in high-risk patients, but the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2008 guidelines do not. This analysis compares cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vs therapeutic retrievable IVCF placement in high-risk trauma patients.\nMarkov modeling was used to determine incremental cost-effectiveness of these guidelines in dollars per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) during hospitalization and long-term follow-up. Our population was 46-year-old trauma patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) by EAST criteria to whom either the EAST (prophylactic IVCF) or ACCP (no prophylactic IVCF) guidelines were applied. The analysis assumed the societal perspective over a lifetime. For base case and sensitivity analyses, probabilities and utilities were obtained from published literature and costs calculated from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedules, the Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project database, and Red Book wholesale drug prices for 2007. For data unavailable from the literature, similarities to other populations were used to make assumptions.\nIn base case analysis, prophylactic IVCFs were more costly ($37,700 vs $37,300) and less effective (by 0.139 QALYs) than therapeutic IVCFs. In sensitivity analysis, the EAST strategy of prophylactic filter placement would become the preferred strategy in individuals never having a filter, with either an annual probability of VTE of \u2265 9.6% (base case, 5.9%), or a very high annual probability of anticoagulation complications of \u2265 24.3% (base case, 2.5%). The EAST strategy would also be favored if the annual probability of venous insufficiency was <7.69% (base case, 13.9%) after filter removal or <1.90% with a retained filter (base case, 14.1%). In initial hospitalization only, EAST guidelines were more costly by $2988 and slightly more effective by .0008 QALY, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $383,638/QALY.\nAnalysis suggests prophylactic IVC filters are not cost-effective in high-risk trauma patients. The magnitude of this result is primarily dependent on probabilities of long-term sequelae (venous thromboembolism, bleeding complications). Even in the initial hospitalization, however, prophylactic IVCF costs for the additional quality-adjusted life years gained did not justify use.",

    "abstract": "In the early postoperative evaluation of the success of arterial revascularization, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and other noninvasive tests lack reliability, especially in patients with incompressible arteries or local edema. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging of limb muscle perfusion may be an alternative to standard tests if it detects treatment success reliably.\nWe compared a simplified CEUS method with clinical staging, pulse volume recording (PVR), and ABI in patients with lifestyle-limiting peripheral arterial disease undergoing revascularization by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or bypass surgery. Patients underwent staging, PVR, ABI, and CEUS before, directly after, and 3 to 5 months after successful PTA (n = 20) or successful bypass grafting (n = 14). For CEUS, contrast agent was injected into an antecubital vein, and the time from beginning to peak intensity of contrast enhancement (TTP) in the calf muscle was measured.\nSuccessful revascularization by both PTA and bypass was associated with a significant improvement in staging, PVR, ABI, and TTP directly after intervention and at follow-up. Median ABI increased from 0.60 to 0.85 (P = .001) after PTA and from 0.36 to 0.76 (P = .003) after bypass surgery. Median TTP decreased from 45 seconds to 24 seconds (P = .015) and from 30 seconds to 27 seconds (P = .041), respectively. McNemar analysis revealed unidirectional changes in both ABI and TTP (P = .625 after PTA and P = 1.000 after bypass surgery), and equivalence analysis showed 95% confidence intervals within clinical indifference, indicating that TTP was equivalent to standard tests in detecting successful revascularization.\nContrast ultrasound perfusion imaging of calf muscle after arterial revascularization may be a valuable alternative to standard noninvasive tests such as ABI or PVR to determine the success of an arterial revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and morbid obesity have been shown to increase wound infections and occasionally mortality after many surgical procedures. Little is known about the relative impact of body mass index (BMI) on these outcomes after open (OAR) and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe 2005-2007 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), a multi-institutional risk-adjusted database, was retrospectively queried to compare perioperative mortality (in-hospital or 30-day) and postoperative wound infections after OAR and EVAR. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and operative details were analyzed. Obesity was defined as a BMI >30 kg/m(2) and morbid obesity as a BMI >40 kg/m(2). Outcomes were compared with t test, Wilcoxon rank sum, \u03c7(2), and multivariate logistic regression.\nThere were 2097 OARs and 3358 EVARs. Compared with EVAR, OAR patients were younger, more likely to be women (26% vs 17%, P < .001), and less obese (27% vs 32%, P < .001). Mortality was 3.7% after OAR vs 1.2% after EVAR (risk ratio, 3.1; P < .001), and overall morbidity was 28% vs 12%, respectively (relative risk, 2.3; P < .001). Morbidly obese patients had a higher mortality for both OAR (7.3%) and EVAR (2.4%) than obese patients (3.9% OAR; 1.5% EVAR) or nonobese patients (3.7% OAR; 1.1% EVAR). Obese patients had a higher rate of wound infection vs nonobese after OAR (6.3% vs 2.4%, P < .001) and EVAR (3.3% vs 1.5%, P < .001). Morbid obesity predicted death after OAR but not after EVAR, and obesity was an independent predictor of wound infection after OAR and EVAR.\nMorbid obesity confers a worse outcome for death after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Obesity is also a risk factor for infectious complications after OAR and EVAR. Obese patients and, particularly, morbidly obese patients should be treated with EVAR when anatomically feasible.",

    "abstract": "Delayed paraplegia after operation on the thoracoabdominal aorta is considered to be related to vulnerability of motor neurons to ischemia. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuronal vulnerability and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after transient ischemia in the spinal cord. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), a chemical chaperone that reduces the load of mutant or unfolded proteins retained in the ER during cellular stress, can protect against ischemic spinal cord damage.\nSpinal cord ischemia was induced in rabbits by direct aortic cross-clamping (below the renal artery and above the bifurcation) for 15 minutes at normothermia. Group A (n = 6) was a sham operation control group. In group B (n = 6) and group C (n = 6), vehicle or 15 mg/kg/h of sodium 4-PBA was infused intravenously, respectively, from 30 minutes before the induction of ischemia until 30 minutes after reperfusion. Neurologic function was assessed at 8 hours, and 2 and 7 days after reperfusion with a Tarlov score. Histologic changes were studied with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry analysis for ER stress-related molecules, including caspase12 and GRP78 were examined.\nThe mean Tarlov scores were 4.0 in every group at 8 hours, but were 4.0, 2.5, and 3.9 at 2 days; and 4.0, 0.7, and 4.0 at 7 days in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The numbers of intact motor neurons at 7 days after reperfusion were 47.4, 21.5, and 44.9 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. There was no significant difference in terms of viable neurons between groups A and C. Caspase12 and GRP78 immunoreactivities were induced in motor neurons in group B, whereas they were not observed in groups A and C.\nReduction in ER stress-induced spinal cord injury was achieved by the administration of 4-PBA. 4-PBA may be a strong candidate for use as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of ischemic spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes remain life-threatening. Time is of the essence, as mortality rises with increasing time after the acute episode. The aim of this report is to show changes in practice and outcomes after the establishment of an acute aortic treatment center (AATC) to expedite the care of acute aortic syndromes in a major metropolitan area with the belief that \"door to intervention time under 90 minutes\" reduces mortality and morbidity from acute aortic disease.\nA database of patients admitted with acute aortic disease (Type A and B aortic dissections, acute thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms, acute and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms) for 1 year prior to initiation (2007) and 1 year after initiation of the pathway (AATC) in 2008 was developed. Comorbidities were scored according to Society of Vascular Surgery criteria. Anatomic and functional outcomes were determined and categorized by Society of Vascular Surgery reporting criteria. Multivariate analysis was performed for categorical outcomes and Cox proportional hazard analyses for time-dependent outcomes.\nSix hundred twenty-one patients reported with aortic disease to the cardiovascular services; 306 patients were considered to have acute disease. When compared with the year before the AATC was instituted, there was a 30% increase in the total number of admissions and a 25% increase in acute pathology after setting up the AATC (P = .02). There was a two-fold increase in thoracic aortic dissections admitted to the service. Initiation of the treatment pathway resulted in a highly significant 64% reduction in time to definitive therapy (526 \u00b1 557 vs 187 \u00b1 258 minutes, mean \u00b1 SD pre-AATC vs AATC; P = .0001). Comorbidity scores were equivalent between the two cohorts. Despite the increase in acuity, mortality (4% vs 6%) and morbidity (41% vs 45%) rates were unchanged, and there was a significant decrease in intensive care unit length of stay (5 vs 4 days, pre-AATC cohort vs the AATC cohort), but total hospital length of stay (11 vs 10 days) was unchanged. There was no correlation between deaths within 30 days and length of stay in the intensive care unit.\nEstablishment of a multidisciplinary AATC pathway was associated with a 30% increase in volume, 64% reduction in time to definitive treatment, improved throughput with reduced intensive care unit time, and maintained clinical efficacy despite an increase in acute admissions. These results suggest the concept be further evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to be superior to medical therapy alone in the prevention of stroke only if it can be safely performed (ie, with a complication rate less than 3% in asymptomatic patients and less than 6% in symptomatic patients). Technical defects are the most common cause of neurological complications after CEA, and their correction has traditionally been performed through standard surgical techniques.\nFrom 1999, we started to treat intimal flaps, dissection, or partial thrombosis after CEA with carotid artery stenting (CAS). A retrospective analysis of the operating room registry and of the registry of our Interventional Cardiology laboratory was conducted in order to identify all the patients that underwent stenting of the internal carotid artery after CEA between January 2001 and June 2009.\nDuring the time period considered, 5012 CEA were performed at our institution and a total of 34 patients (34/5012; 0.6%) were found to have received carotid stenting after CEA, both for symptomatic and asymptomatic defects. Immediate technical success was obtained in all patients. One major cerebrovascular adverse event (1/34; 3%) in the immediate perioperative period was recorded. At a mean follow-up of 18.6 months (range, 3-84 months; median, 12 months), we did not observe any neurological symptoms related to the treated carotid artery, nor hemodynamic in-stent restenosis. Long-term follow-up (ie, equal or greater than 4 years) was available for five patients: all patients remained event-free during the entire period.\nOur study adds to the assumption that CAS in post-CEA symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is safe and technically feasible, and represents a valid and quick alternative to standard surgical revision. Even if in a small group of patients, long-term results seem promising.",

Here, we demonstrate endothelial gene silencing in human saphenous vein using three rapid siRNA transfection techniques amenable for use in the operating room.\nControl siRNA, Cy5 siRNA, or siRNA targeting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or endothelial specific nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were applied to surplus human saphenous vein for 10 minutes by (i) soaking, (ii) applying 300 mm Hg hyperbaric pressure, or (iii) 120 mm Hg luminal distending pressure. Transfected vein segments were maintained in organ culture. siRNA delivery and gene silencing were assessed by tissue layer using confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\nDistending pressure transfection yielded the highest levels of endothelial siRNA delivery (22% pixels fluorescing) and gene silencing (60% GAPDH knockdown, 55% eNOS knockdown) as compared with hyperbaric (12% pixels fluorescing, 36% GAPDH knockdown, 30% eNOS knockdown) or non-pressurized transfections (10% pixels fluorescing, 30% GAPDH knockdown, 25% eNOS knockdown). Cumulative endothelial siRNA delivery (16% pixels fluorescing) and gene silencing (46% GAPDH knockdown) exceeded levels achieved in the media/adventitia (8% pixels fluorescing, 24% GAPDH knockdown) across all transfection methods.\nEndothelial gene silencing is possible within the time frame and conditions of surgical application without the use of transfection reagents. The high sensitivity of endothelial cells to siRNA transfection marks the endothelium as a promising target of gene therapy in vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Failure to conform to the arch (\"bird-beaking\") can lead to endoleak and graft collapse after thoracic endovascular aortic repair. We report the first United States experience with the new TX2 Pro-Form (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind), a novel delivery system that became commercially available in October 2009, designed to enhance circumferential apposition of the TX2 thoracic endograft to the arch.\nThis was a single-institution retrospective study. Endograft-to-arch conformance was quantitatively analyzed using intraoperative angiograms of consecutive, reverse chronologic cohorts of TX2 Pro-Form, TX2 Z-Trak (prior delivery system; Cook), and Gore TAG (W.L. Gore and Assoc, Flagstaff, Ariz). Only native aortic arch deployments in zones 2 and 3 were included.\nDuring a 6-week period, 20 Pro-Form cases were performed, of which 17 patients met inclusion criteria. These were compared with 17 Z-Trak and 17 TAG patients. Endografts were successfully delivered to their intended proximal landing zones in all 51 patients. A higher proportion of dissections were treated in the Z-Trak (65%) and TAG (76%) patients (P = .03), but similar rates of zone 2/3 deployments (P = .30). Despite the mean arch angle being greatest for the Pro-Form patients (90\u00b0 vs 74\u00b0 vs 71\u00b0, P = .18), the mean separation between the leading endograft edge and the aortic wall along the inner curvature of the arch was significantly less (1.4 vs 4.1 vs 5.7 mm; P = .0002), with complete apposition achieved in 65% of Pro-Form patients (18% Z-Trak, 6% TAG, P < .0001). This resulted in the lowest reduction in aortic luminal diameter at the proximal landing zone (5.5% vs 13.4% vs 19.3%; P = .0006) compared with Z-Trak and TAG. Rates of type Ia endoleak were similar (P = .38).\nThe Pro-Form delivery system significantly improves endograft conformation to the arch, resulting in minimum bird-beaking even in severely angulated anatomies.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of the lymphatic system in KTS.\nMagnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) with the use of gadobenate dimeglumine as the contrast was performed on 32 patients with KTS involving the extremities to evaluate lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and veins.\nThirty-one of 32 patients exhibited lymphatic vessel and/or lymph node anomalies, including hyperplasia (11/31), hypoplasia or aplasia (20/31) of lymphatic vessels, and lymphedema (31/31) of the affected limbs. Twenty-two patients showed asymmetry of the inguinal nodes exhibiting either the absence, or an increase or a decrease in number and size of the inguinal nodes. Venous dysplasia was found in 31 patients in superficial and/or deep veins. The results showed a high concomitance of malformations of the lymphatic system and veins in the affected limbs of patients with KTS.\nLymphatic system abnormalities as examined with MRL are commonly associated with KTS and are likely to play a significant role in the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Stent graft-induced new entry (SINE), defined as the new tear caused by the stent graft and excluding those arising from natural disease progression or iatrogenic injury from the endovascular manipulation, has been increasingly observed after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for Stanford type B dissection in our center. SINE appears to be remarkably life threatening. We investigated the incidence, mortality, causes, and preventions of SINE after TEVAR for Stanford type B dissection.\nData for 22 patients with SINE were retrospectively collected and analyzed from 650 patients undergoing TEVAR for type B dissection from August 2000 to June 2008. An additional patient was referred to our center 14 months after TEVAR was performed in another hospital. The potential associations of SINE with Marfan syndrome, location of SINE and endograft placement, and the oversizing rate were analyzed by Fisher exact probability test or t test.\nWe found 24 SINE tears in 23 patients, including SINE at the proximal end of the endograft in 15, at the distal end in 7, and at both ends in 1. Six patients died. SINE incidence and mortality reached 3.4% and 26.1%, respectively. Two SINE patients were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, whereas there were only 6 Marfan patients among the 651 patients. The 16 proximal SINEs were evidenced at the greater curve of the arch and caused retrograde type A dissection. The eight distal SINEs occurred at the dissected flap, and five caused enlarging aneurysm whereas three remained stable. The endograft was placed across the distal aortic arch during the primary TEVAR in all 23 patients. The incidence of SINE was 33.33% among Marfan patients vs 3.26% among non-Marfan patients (P = .016). There was no significant difference in mortality between proximal and distal SINE (25% vs 28.6%, P > .99), incidence of SINE between endograft placement across the arch and at the straight portion of descending thoracic aorta (23 of 613 vs 0 of 38, P = .39), and the oversizing rate between SINE and non-SINE patients (13% \u00b1 4.5% vs 16% \u00b1 6.5%, P = .98).\nSINE appears not to be rare after TEVAR for type B dissection and is associated with substantial mortality. The stress yielded by the endograft seems to play a predominant role in its occurrence. It is important to take this stress-induced injury into account during both design and placement of the endograft.",

    "abstract": "American and European guidelines recommend the distal radial-cephalic fistula (dRCF) as the first and best hemodialysis access in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, this kind of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) shows a limited primary unassisted patency and frequently needs surgical revisions or angiographic procedures, or both. When dRCF is not feasible, guidelines suggest a proximal brachiocephalic AVF. The middle-arm fistula (MAF), or autogenous forearm radial-median direct access, has been suggested as a possible alternative approach. This study evaluated MAF primary unassisted patency, the most frequent causes of MAF failure, and the possible related factors.\nData on patients with a MAF placed from January 1991 until June 2008 were retrospectively collected. The probability of MAF failure overall and by the main subgroups was estimated according to Kaplan-Meier with Greenwood standard error (SE). Comparison of failure among different subgroups was performed using the log rank test in univariate analyses. The Cox regression model was used to investigate factors that independently affected the overall hazard of failure and cause-specific hazard of thrombosis.\nAt the end of follow-up, 14.0% of MAF failed (11.6% thrombosis, 1.7% stenosis, 0.7% failed maturation), and 44.2% of MAF were still working. Cumulative probability of MAF unassisted primary patency after 4 years from the creation was 79%. Univariate analyses highlighted that women (P = .019), underweight patients (P = .010), and MAF implantation after starting hemodialysis (P < .001) had a higher risk of MAF failure for any cause than men, normal and overweight patients, and MAF implanted before starting hemodialysis. Results of the Cox multivariate analysis for overall MAF failure confirmed that only MAF implantation before starting hemodialysis is a protective factor against any failure (P = .003), whereas female gender (P = .016) was associated with an increase of the thrombosis hazard ratio to 2.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.63).\nOur data demonstrate that MAF has a good unassisted primary patency and suggest that this kind of AVF could be a valuable alternative surgical approach when dRCF is not feasible in ESRD patients.",

This study evaluated our experience with the patency outcomes and complication rates of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) AVGs placed in the thigh.\nA retrospective outcomes analysis was performed of all femoral AVGs inserted between January 1992 and July 2007. Data were obtained by review of medical records for patient demographics, comorbidities, and AVG-related outcomes. Patency, complication rates, and risk factors for infection were determined.\nA total of 153 prosthetic AVGs were placed in 127 patients (63 men). Mean patient age was 52.7 \u00b1 16.3 years. Median follow-up was 25 months (range, 1-169 months). The most common underlying renal disease was glomerulonephritis in 27 (21%). Hypertension and coronary artery disease were common comorbidities, respectively, in 49 (39%) and 23 patients (18%). The primary and secondary AVG patency rates at 12 months were 53.9% and 75.3%, respectively, and 2- and 5-year patency rates were, respectively, 39.6% and 19.3% (primary) and 63.8% and 50.6% (secondary). The mean AVG survival for all cases was 31.6 months (range, 0-149 months). Surgical thrombectomy was required in 82 (54%), and 22 AVGs (14%) required surgical revision for stenosis. Infection occurred in 41 AVGs (27%), and limb ischemia occurred in 2 (1.3%). Statistical analysis did not reveal a significant risk factor for infection.\nFemoral AVGs are a suitable alternative to upper limb vascular access, with acceptable primary and secondary patency rates. Infection occurred in approximately one-quarter of cases, whereas steal was uncommon.",

Today, endovascular treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is associated with markedly decreased morbidity and mortality compared with the open surgical approach, yet there are several fundamental obstacles in our ability to offer these endovascular techniques to most patients with ruptured aneurysms. This article will focus on the technical aspects of endovascular aneurysm repair for rupture, with particular attention to developing a standardized multidisciplinary approach that will help vascular surgeons deal with not just the technical aspects of these procedures but also address some of the challenges, including the availability of preoperative computed tomography, the choice of anesthesia, the percutaneous vs femoral cutdown approach, use of aortic occlusion balloons, need for bifurcated vs aortouniiliac stent grafts, need for adjunctive procedures, diagnosis and treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome, and conversion to open surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the outcomes of secondary procedures after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nFrom 2002 to 2009, 1768 patients underwent EVAR for treatment of 1662 elective (94%) and 106 emergent (6%) infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a variety of Food and Drug Administration-approved and commercially available stent grafts. Postoperative follow-up included clinical examination, pulse volume recording, duplex ultrasound imaging, and computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Patients with type I and III endoleaks, unexplained endotension, limb occlusion, stent graft migration, with and without type I endoleak, and aneurysm rupture underwent secondary interventions. Type II endoleak at >6 months without a decrease in the aneurysm sac underwent translumbar embolization. Data were prospectively collected.\nEVAR was performed in 1768 patients. During a mean follow-up of 34 (SD, 30.03) months, 339 patients (19.2%) required additional secondary procedures for aneurysm-related complications, including type I (n = 51, 15.0%), type II (n = 136, 40.1%), and type III (n = 5, 1.5%) endoleaks; endotension (n = 8, 2.4%), stent graft migration proximal fixation site (n = 46, 13.6%), stent graft iliac limb thrombosis or stenosis (n = 25, 7.4%), subsequent iliac aneurysm formation (n = 39, 11.5%), or aneurysm rupture after EVAR (n = 29, 8.6%). The mean age was 74 (SD, 9.15) years. Mean AAA size was 5.7 (SD 3.24) cm. Compared with secondary procedures for AAA rupture, the nonrupture patients had a significantly lower mortality (1.6% vs 17.2%, P < .05) and a higher likelihood of being managed by endovascular means (98.8% vs 44.8%, P < .05). When nonruptured EVAR patients required urgent secondary procedures for type I endoleaks and stent graft migration or limb thrombosis, the mortality was 6.0% vs 0.5% for elective procedures (P < .05).\nOur long-term EVAR experience indicates that 18% of patients require additional secondary procedures, and most of these patients can be managed by endovascular means with an acceptable overall mortality of 2.9%. Most type I and II endoleaks can be successfully treated by transluminal embolization, and most patients with delayed aneurysm rupture after EVAR can be successfully managed by endovascular or open surgical repair.",

The study purpose was to evaluate, in a randomized study, the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin versus heparin during CAS, using proximal endovascular occlusion (PEO) as a distal protection device.\nFrom January 2006 to December 2009, 220 patients undergoing CAS using PEO have been randomly assigned to one of the study arms (control arm: 100 UI/kg UFH or bivalirudin arm: 0.75 mg/kg intravenous bolus and intraprocedural infusion at 1.75 mg/kg/h).\nProcedural success was achieved in all the patients. No episodes of intraprocedural thrombosis occurred. One major stroke occurred in the bivalirudin arm, and two minor strokes occurred, one in each group. A significant difference in the incidence of postprocedural bleedings was observed between the study groups; bivalirudin use was associated with reduced number of bleedings according to Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction criteria.\nThe use of bivalirudin should be considered a safe and effective anticoagulation regimen during CAS, using PEO as a distal protection device.

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-SD) has recently been reported to occur in the cardiovascular system and manifest as inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Thoracic aortic lesions are often associated with aortitis in several divergent etiologies. Thus, this study was performed to review thoracic aortic lesions from the aspect of IgG4-SD and to elucidate the clinicopathologic characteristics of this subgroup in the thoracic aorta.\nThe study comprised 125 patients, including 71 with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), 44 with aortic dissection, 7 with Takayasu aortitis, and 3 with infectious aortitis. IgG4-SD was identified by diffuse infiltration of numerous IgG4-positive plasmacytes by immunohistochemical examinations. Clinicopathologic features were compared between IgG4-related and IgG4-unrelated lesions.\nAmong the 125 patients, IgG4-SD was found in 5 patients with TAA but was not detected in the other subgroups of thoracic aortic lesion. IgG4-related TAA included one case of lymphoplasmacytic aortitis, 1 case of inflammatory aneurysm, and three cases of atherosclerotic aneurysms. Patients with IgG4-related TAA showed clinicopathologic features similar to patients with IgG4-SD: male gender, old age, history of bronchial asthma and allergies, elevation of white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein levels, and IgG4 and IgE concentrations (in one patient); eosinophilic infiltration, obliterative phlebitis, lymph follicle formation, and perineural inflammation. In addition, compared with IgG4-unrelated TAA, IgG4-related TAA was characterized by clinically more frequency of involvement of the aortic arch (P = .002), saccular formation (P = .003), and fibrous adhesion to surrounding tissue (P < .001), and histopathologically thicker entire aortic wall and adventitia (P < .001 each).\nIgG4-SD is involved in 4% of all thoracic aortic lesions and uniformly presents in the form of an aneurysm with distinct histologic and clinicopathologic features. IgG4-SD represents one, albeit rare, etiology of TAA, especially those originating in the aortic arch.",

    "abstract": "In risk stratification of aortic diseases such as aneurysm and aortic dissection, diameter is one parameter whose influence on the average aortic wall stress is directly described by the Laplace law. More advanced mechanical models can be used and may yield additional information, such as transmural stress distributions. The question then arises of how refined models need to be to provide clinicians with practical help.\nTwo sets of finite element models were used. The relative roles of diameter, material stiffness, longitudinal stretch, blood pressure, wall thickness, and vessel curvature were explored using simplified aortic models for comparison with the Laplace law. The influences of the material properties nonlinearity and residual stress on the transmural stress distribution were investigated using an advanced aortic model including recent experimental findings in older humans.\nThe Laplace law was confirmed as one effective, basic tool to assess the average wall stress in the aortic wall, both in the circumferential and longitudinal directions. However, the simplified models were sufficient to show that, as already reported in the literature, longitudinal stretch and vessel curvature have potentially equally strong or even stronger contributions to wall stress than the parameters included in the Laplace law. When the advanced model was used, and residual stress induced by large opening angles such as found in older subjects was introduced, the transmural stress gradient was found inverted compared with expectations, with the largest stresses now toward the adventitia. The results suggested that the intima may be increasingly shielded from higher stresses as one gets older, which might be protective against the initiation of dissection tears in the thoracic aorta.\nBiomechanical analysis of the aorta may be refined by using increasingly detailed computational models. Simplified models can readily improve on the Laplace law in the assessment of aortic wall stress, and as such, may already contribute to better risk stratification of aortic disease. Advanced models may also enhance our understanding of the mechanistic aspects in the pathogenesis of aortic disease. However, their applicability in a patient-specific context may be limited by the large number of input data they require, some of which might stay out of the clinicians' reach.",

    "abstract": "Despite the absence of a relationship between cholesterol and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion, there is evidence from a number of studies to suggest that statin therapy may influence AAA expansion, presumably through pleiotropic effects. To confirm whether statin therapy is associated with less AAA expansion, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical controlled studies of statin therapy for prevention of AAA expansion.\nTo identify all clinical studies of statin therapy vs control (no statins) enrolling patients with small (\u2264 55 mm) AAA, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. For each study, data regarding AAA expansion in both the statin and control groups were used to generate standardized mean differences (SMDs; <0 favoring statin therapy; >0 favoring control) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic SMDs in fixed-effects and random-effects models.\nWe identified five clinical controlled studies of statin therapy vs control enrolling patients with small AAA, including no randomized and five observational studies. Our meta-analysis included data on 697 patients with small AAA received statin therapy or no statins. Pooled analysis demonstrated that statin therapy was statistically significantly associated with less expansion rates (random-effects SMD, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.25; P = .0001). There was statistically significant trial heterogeneity of results (P = .03). Exclusion of any single trial from the analysis did not substantively alter the overall result of our analysis. There was no evidence of significant publication bias (P = .81).\nStatin therapy is associated with less expansion rates in patients with small AAA. To confirm our results and more accurately assess the effect of statins on AAA expansion, a large randomized trial is needed.",

    "abstract": "A 24-year-old Japanese woman underwent ilioaxillary bypass with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft and axillocarotid bypass with an autologous saphenous vein graft for severe brain ischemia due to Takayasu arteritis. A method that involved wrapping strips of the graft around the artery was used to prevent stretching of the anastomotic site. Her general condition and symptoms improved remarkably. She became pregnant three times and delivered the infants without any complications caused by the operation. The present case contributes to proof of patency, effectiveness, and durability of these bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "The rising numbers in the aging population will undoubtedly lead to a corresponding increase in percutaneous endovascular procedures to address their cardiovascular health issues. With a constant drive to develop innovative treatment methods to achieve improved treatment outcomes while reducing procedural-related complications, endovascular interventionalists have focused on technologies to provide efficient hemostatic control of femoral artery access following percutaneous diagnostic or therapeutic angiographic procedures. Compared with the traditional hemostatic method using manual compression, several arterial closure devices (ACD) have been shown to reduce time of hemostasis, enable early patient ambulation, reduce hospitalization staff use, and improve patient outcome. However, these ACDs have their shortcomings as the interventionalists need to be familiar with these technologies as well as their potential complications. This article provides a comprehensive review of current closure device technologies as well as clinical experiences with these devices. The adjunctive role of these technologies in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair is also discussed.",
