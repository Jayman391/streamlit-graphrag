    "abstract": "A prominent vascular surgeon is approached by a representative of a large medical device company with a proposal to implant a new self-sealing patch for closing open carotid endarterectomies. The patch is made of a new synthetic material that establishes immediate hemostasis and inhibits restenosis in animal studies. It has just been approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration. The cost of the new patch is much higher than for established comparable products, even when potential long-term benefits are considered, but using it would reduce the operative time required for achieving hemostasis. The manufacturer's representative tells you that the company will pay a selected group of vascular surgeons $500 apiece each time they insert the patch on their patients and complete a one-page report. Surgeons with the highest volume of cases utilizing the patch will be offered a paid clinical consultancy with the company. You've used another company's product for several years and found it entirely satisfactory, but have followed development of the new patch with interest and considered trying it in your patients having carotid endarterectomies. What should you do? A. Join the study. You probably would have used the new patch on your patients anyway. B. If the early data warrant, implant the patch on a trial basis without enrolling in the project, and finally decide whether to continue using it based on your clinical experience and additional published reports. C. Call some of the other investigators who have already enrolled in the project and ask them about their experience. D. Decline the invitation immediately. Refuse to ever speak to the representative again. E. Estimate the ability of your patients to sustain the high cost of the new product and decide accordingly whether to use it.",

    "abstract": "Patients with acute deep vein thrombosis involving the iliofemoral venous system experience the most severe postthrombotic sequelae. Treatment designed to reduce or eliminate the postthrombotic syndrome must necessarily remove thrombus to eliminate obstruction. Unfortunately, currently published guidelines do not recommend venous thrombectomy and actually recommend against its use because of the poor results initially reported. However, recent reports of venous thrombectomy and the long-term results of a large randomized trial confirm the significant benefit compared with anticoagulation alone. The technique of contemporary venous thrombectomy follows basic vascular surgical principles and offers patients the opportunity for complete or nearly complete thrombus extraction, thereby avoiding the significant morbidity of their anticipated postthrombotic syndrome. The techniques described herein represent the authors' approach to patients with few alternatives to clear the venous system. Because the patient benefit is well established, vascular surgeons should include contemporary venous thrombectomy as part of their routine operative armamentarium, offering this procedure to patients with extensive deep vein thrombosis involving the iliofemoral venous system, especially if other options are not available or have failed.",

Follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans 4 and 5 years after endovascular aneurysm repair showed a homogeneous, nonenhancing, but clearly growing, pelvic collection. CT-guided drainage of the collection was performed, and cultures of the evacuated brown fluid were negative for any infection. Control CT scan after drainage showed a complete collapse of both the collection and the previously excluded iliac aneurysms. A direct communication between the sterile pelvic collection and the excluded iliac aneurysm was suggested on this CT imaging and confirmed afterwards by surgery. From these imaging and surgical findings, this pelvic collection can be considered as an atypical presentation of an asymptomatic contained rupture of the excluded aneurysm.",

He was found to have bilateral high-grade internal iliac artery stenoses on arteriography. Both sides were successfully treated in a staged fashion via a contralateral approach with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and a balloon-expandable stent, with complete symptom resolution. A clinical vascular examination with normal findings of the common iliac, external iliac, and common and superficial femoral arteries eliminates significant vascular obstruction as a cause of claudication. However, internal iliac occlusive disease may be suspected when symptoms are limited to the gluteal musculature and other causes are eliminated. Percutaneous interventions can be of diagnostic and therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "Placement in baboons of a distal femoral arteriovenous fistula increases shear stress through aortoiliac polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts and induces regression of a preformed neointima. Atrophy of the neointima might be controlled by shear stress-induced genes, including the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). We have investigated the expression and function of BMPs 2, 4, and 5 in the graft neointima and in cultured baboon smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nBaboons received bilateral aortoiliac PTFE grafts and 8 weeks later, a unilateral femoral arteriovenous fistula.\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that high shear stress increased BMP2, 4, and 5 messenger RNA (mRNA) in graft intima between 1 and 7 days, while noggin (a BMP inhibitor) mRNA was decreased. BMP4 most potently (60% inhibition) inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated SMC proliferation compared with BMP2 and BMP5 (31% and 26%, respectively). BMP4 also increased SMC death by 190% +/- 10%. Noggin reversed the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of BMP4. Finally, Western blotting confirmed BMP4 protein upregulation by high shear stress at 4 days. BMP4 expression demonstrated by in situ hybridization was confined to endothelial cells.\nIncreased BMPs (particularly BMP4) coupled with decreased noggin may promote high shear stress-mediated graft neointimal atrophy by inhibiting SMC proliferation and increasing SMC death.",

This in vivo study assessed the use of TGF-beta3 in attenuating the development of postanastomotic smooth muscle cell proliferation.\nUnder general anesthesia, 10 adult goats underwent transection and reanastomosis of both common carotid arteries. After reanastomosis, one artery was infiltrated with 50 ng of TGF-beta3 in 100 microL of pH buffer around the anastomosis, and the other side was infiltrated with buffer only. After surgery, each animal received 150 mg of aspirin daily. The arteries were explanted after 3 months for histologic examination.\nVessel wall thickness surrounding the anastomosis was reduced by 30% after TGF-beta3 treatment compared with placebo (P = .003), with a 20% (P = .002) reduction in cellular content. Although total collagen content was not significantly different between TGF-beta3 and placebo, collagen type VIII content was reduced around the TGF-beta3 anastomoses (P = .011). A reduction in the total elastin content (P = .003) and number of elastic fiber lamellae (P = .042) was found surrounding TGF-beta3-treated anastomoses, but not placebo-treated anastomosis.

    "abstract": "Vasculogenesis relies on the recruitment of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BMD EPCs) and is stimulated by tissue-level ischemia. We hypothesized that the BMD EPC response is impaired in ischemic wounds and studied the relationship between BMD EPCs and wound healing.\nWe used transgenic Tie-2/LacZ mice, which carry the beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) reporter gene under Tie-2 promoter control. Wild-type mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with Tie-2/LacZ bone marrow. Four weeks later, the mice underwent unilateral femoral artery ligation/excision and bilateral wounding of the hindlimbs. Ischemia was confirmed and monitored with laser Doppler imaging. A subset of mice received incisional vs excisional nonischemic bilateral hindlimb wounds, without femoral ligation. Excisional wound closure was measured by using daily digital imaging and software-assisted calculation of surface area.\nIschemia resulted in significantly delayed wound healing and differentially affected the number of BMD EPCs recruited to wound granulation tissue and muscle underlying the wounds. At 3 days postwounding, the granulation tissue of the wound base contained significantly fewer numbers of BMD EPCs in ischemic wounds compared with the nonischemic wounds (P < .05). In contrast, significantly more BMD EPCs were present in the muscle underlying the ischemic wounds at this same time point compared with the muscle under the nonischemic wounds (P < .05). In ischemic wounds, eventual wound closure significantly correlated with a delayed rise in BMD EPCs within the wound granulation tissue (Kendall's correlation, -.811, P = .0005) and was significantly associated with a gradual recovery of hindlimb perfusion (P < .0001). By 7 days postwounding, BMD EPCs were incorporated into the neovessels in the granulation tissue. At 14 days and 75 days, BMD EPCs were rarely observed within the wounds.\nGranulation tissue of excisional ischemic wounds showed significantly less BMD EPCs 3 days postwounding, in association with significantly delayed wound closure. However, the number of BMD EPCs were increased in ischemic hindlimb skeletal muscle, consistent with the notion that ischemia is a powerful signal for vasculogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying a deficit in BMD EPCs in the granulation tissue of ischemic skin wounds and reporting the key role for these cells in both ischemic and nonischemic wound healing.",

    "abstract": "The potent physiologic endogenous angiogenic response to ischemic stimuli is often suboptimal, and therefore, a better understanding of the basic mechanisms is essential for the use in therapeutic angiogenesis. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a major transcription factor that promotes ischemia-driven angiogenesis and is induced when the HIF-1alpha subunit is upregulated. However, little is known about the endogenous angiogenic response and the role of HIF-1alpha in human critical limb ischemia (CLI). We aimed to investigate the extent of the angiogenic response and the expression of HIF-1alpha in the lower limbs of CLI patients.\nSkeletal muscle biopsy specimens were obtained from the lower limbs of 12 patients with CLI and 12 patients without limb ischemia (controls), with ethical committee approval. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by using endothelial marker anti-CD31, and HIF-1alpha expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. MVD was measured as the median number of microvessels in x200 magnification fields. Five random fields per section and three sections per biopsy specimen were analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and Western blotting were used to quantify the HIF-1alpha levels. Colocalization between cell-specific antigens was investigated by double immunofluorescence labelling by using confocal microscopy. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test.\nThe CLI group have significantly higher MVD, with an increase of 2.7-fold compared with the controls (P < 0.001). HIF-1alpha expression was significantly increased in CLI muscles (P < 0.001) and was localized to vascular endothelial cells.\nOur findings suggest that the endogenous angiogenic response occurs in CLI. The increased HIF-1alpha level and colocalization to vascular endothelial cells suggest that HIF-1alpha plays a role in the physiologic endogenous angiogenic response in CLI. Therefore, augmentation of the HIF-1alpha pathway may be an important aspect in therapeutic angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation is a result of inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins), although clinically used as lipid-lowering agents, have also been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects. This study was designed to determine whether the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitor simvastatin suppresses aneurysm formation in an elastase-induced rat AAA model.\nAneurysms were created in adult male Wistar rats by infusion of elastase into isolated infrarenal aortic segments. The rats were randomized to receive either simvastatin (n = 17) or placebo (n = 17) by gastric lavage daily starting the day before surgery. The rats were euthanized and the infrarenal aortas harvested on postoperative day 7. Aortic diameters were measured before infusion, immediately after infusion, and at the time of harvesting. Protein expression was measured by immunoblot analysis. Gene expression profiling using Affymetrix U34A rat genome chips was performed to identify changes in gene expression caused by simvastatin treatment.\nMean aneurysm diameter was significantly less in the simvastatin treatment group compared with controls (3.4 +/- 0.08 mm vs 4.3 +/- 0.19 mm; P = .0001). MMP-9 and nuclear factor-kappaB protein levels were decreased in the aortas of simvastatin-treated animals. Gene microarray analysis revealed 315 genes with statistically significant changes in expression (P < .05) in the simvastatin group. Genes related to inflammation, ECM remodeling, and oxidative stress function were downregulated. These included genes for interleukin 1, interleukin 4, inducible nitric oxide synthase, P-selectin, platelet-derived growth factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor, and several chemokines.\nSimvastatin significantly suppresses experimental aneurysm expansion and reduces protein levels of MMP-9 and nuclear factor-kappaB. Gene array analysis provides evidence that several mediators of inflammation, matrix remodeling, and oxidative stress are downregulated by simvastatin treatment. This suggests that simvastatin inhibits AAA formation by blocking the expression of certain proinflammatory genes. Simvastatin may be useful as an adjuvant therapy to suppress the growth of small aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "This study used a canine model of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) to compare intra-aneurysmal pressure and thrombus formation after exclusion with Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) stent-grafts.\nProsthetic AAAs with implanted strain-gauge pressure transducers were treated by stent-graft exclusion using Food and Drug Administration-approved devices in 10 mongrel dogs: five Dacron (AneuRx) and five ePTFE (original Excluder). Intra-aneurysmal pressure was measured over 4 weeks after AAA exclusion and indexed to the systemic pressure, represented as a percentage of a simultaneously obtained systemic pressure (value = 1.0). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus was performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after exclusion and expressed as a signal-to-noise ratio (S:N) to control for background signal intensity. Comparisons of pressures and S:N between the two stent-grafts was analyzed with the Student's t test. Intra-aneurysmal thrombus was characterized histologically.\nIn animals excluded with both Dacron and ePTFE stent-grafts, the intra-aneurysmal pressure was nonpulsatile and reduced to <30% of systemic pressure. Significantly greater pressure transmission was observed after AAA exclusion using ePTFE compared with Dacron stent grafts (systolic pressure: ePTFE, 0.28 +/- 0.12 vs Dacron, 0.11 +/- 0.02, P < .001; mean pressure: ePTFE, 0.16 +/- 0.08 vs Dacron, 0.06 +/- 0.02, P < .001). MRI confirmed the absence of perfusion in all aneurysms. The T1-weighted signal intensity remained persistently elevated (S:N at 1 week, 2.7 +/- 0.4 vs 2 weeks, 4.0 +/- 0.2 vs 4 weeks, 5.4 +/- 1.3) in ePTFE-treated intra-aneurysmal thrombus, suggesting an absence of thrombus organization. In contrast, progressive evolution of T1 signal intensity in aneurysms excluded by Dacron stent-grafts was consistent with maturation from intact red blood cells (S:N at 1 week, 3.3 +/- 0.4) to methemoglobin (S:N at 2 weeks, 6.1 +/- 0.8), and then hemosiderin and ferritin (S:N at 4 weeks, 2.4 +/- 0.5). Histologically, ePTFE-excluded aneurysms contained poorly organized thrombus with red blood cell fragments and haphazardly arranged fibrin deposition indicative of active remodeling and continued influx of transudated serum. In aneurysms excluded by Dacron stent-grafts, dense, mature collagenous connective tissue and organized fibrin were present, indicative of greater thrombus organization.\nStent-graft treatment reduces intra-aneurysmal pressure to <30% of systemic pressure when no endoleak is present; however, significantly greater pressure is present in aneurysms treated with porous ePTFE stent-grafts than Dacron grafts. Histologic and MRI imaging analysis suggest that active transudation of serous blood components may be contributing to this increased intra-aneurysmal pressure.",

    "abstract": "Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare form of hepatic venous outflow obstruction at the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC), the hepatic veins, or both. We assessed our 4-year experience in the management of BCS to evaluate the results of our methods of care.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of a nonrandomized clinical trial conducted in three teaching hospitals. Among 28 primary BCS patients, 9 remained in medical treatment only, and 19 who failed to respond to medical treatment received additional endovascular (n = 17) or surgical therapy (n = 2). Nine underwent IVC balloon angioplasty alone, 6 had angioplasty plus stents, and 2 had transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) for hepatic vein lesions. One patient had a mesoatrial bypass; another had liver transplantation. Immediate response to the therapy was assessed with angiography and ultrasonography based on anatomic and/or hemodynamic correction or reduction of the lesion. Subsequent assessment of portal hypertension status was made with periodic clinical and laboratory evaluation (eg, ultrasonography, liver biopsy).\nTwenty-six patients had had IVC stenosis or occlusion by focal or segmental lesion. Two patients had hepatic vein outlet obstruction. There was no evidence of coagulopathy as the pathogenesis; all were related to membranous obstruction of the vena cava. Excellent immediate response to the endovascular therapy and subsequent relief of portal hypertension were achieved in 14 patients. Four patients had restenosis or progression of the residual lesion within 2 years; three responded to repeated stenting. Primary patency was 76.5%, and primary assisted patency was 94.1%. Two patients with TIPS and two with surgical therapy maintained excellent results. The medical treatment remained effective only in a limited group of 6 (21.4%) of the 28 patients.\nIn BCS, both endovascular and surgical interventions provide excellent results and potentially halt liver parenchymal deterioration caused by portal hypertension. Liver transplantation remains the ultimate solution for advanced liver failure.",

    "abstract": "Venous leg ulcers are a growing socioeconomic burden. Pale sulfonated shale oils (PSSO) are used for therapy of inflammatory skin diseases and have been shown to enhance wound healing in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PSSO is capable of enhancing venous ulcer healing beyond compression therapy alone.\nOne hundred nineteen patients were enrolled in this randomized, multicenter, observer-blind study. In the treatment group, PSSO 10% was applied daily for 20 weeks, and the control group received the vehicle only. Wounds were covered by a nonadherent gauze dressing, and compression therapy with short-stretch elastic bandages was performed in an outpatient setting. The primary study end point was defined as cumulative reduction in wound area; the secondary study end point was treatment success as assessed by both physicians and patients. Additionally, adverse events, including changes with respect to physical examination and vital signs, were documented.\nAt the end of the study period, ulcer size was significantly more reduced in the PSSO group compared with the vehicle group (15 +/- 15.9 to 6.2 +/- 12.9 cm(2) vs 11.4 +/- 14.5 to 10.8 +/- 15.7 cm(2); P = .0005). The cumulative relative reduction in ulcer area was significantly higher in the PSSO group (-4391 +/- 4748.7 vs -231.9 +/- 6283.6 % x days; P < .0001). Relative reduction in wound area was significantly greater in the PSSO group as early as 6 weeks after the beginning of treatment (-47.4 +/- 28.4 vs -23.8 +/- 42.2%; P < .001). PSSO was judged successful both by physicians and patients. There were no significant differences in adverse events (PSSO, 9 [12.2%]; vehicle, 7 [11.1%]. Similarly, tolerability of PSSO was equal to the tolerability of the vehicle.\nPale sulfonated shale oils were capable of favoring venous ulcer healing in addition to compression therapy.

    "abstract": "The objective of this randomized, prospective, blinded study was to determine the relative effects of two laser wavelengths in the treatment of great saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency.\nFifty-one male and female patients scheduled for routine laser treatment of GSV insufficiency provided signed informed consent for the procedure. Patients were randomized to receive endovenous laser treatment with a wavelength of 810 or 980 nm. The same surgeon, blinded to the wavelength, performed all procedures. Nonoperating study staff, blinded to the laser wavelengths, evaluated patients before and after the procedure regarding physical signs and symptoms. Patients were monitored within 72 hours after the procedure (via duplex ultrasonography), at 1 week (by procedural site photos scored for bruising, as well as a pain score), at 3 weeks, and at 4 months for bruising, physical and emotional effects of the procedure (scored by patients on a five-point visual analogue scale), and symptoms (scored by the physician), along with adverse events. Patients were followed up for a year to determine the long-term efficacy of the procedure.\nThe 51 patients (38 women and 13 men; mean age, 52.4 +/- 11.7 years) completed treatment and follow-up examination (30 legs for each wavelength). At 72 hours after the procedure, no significant differences were noted between patient outcomes, physical conditions, and symptoms and or possible adverse events. At 1 week after the procedure, bruising scores were significantly different (P < .005): patients in the 980-nm group showed less bruising of the procedure site than the patients in the 810-nm group. Only three physical or symptom parameters presented with significant differences (P < .05) over time-less itching was noted by 810 nm-treated patients at 3 weeks after the procedure, lower levels of pain intensity were seen in the 980 nm-treated patients at the 4-month follow-up visit, and lower varicose vein ratings were seen for the 980 nm-treated patients at the 4-month follow-up visit. Thirteen legs were phlebitic at 7 days after the procedure (10 in the 810-nm group and 3 in the 980-nm group). Two treatment failures occurred (one patient in each treatment group); both patients exhibited flow in the treated venous segment at the 4-month follow-up visit. Two other patients (one in each group) had treatment failure at the 1-year follow-up, demonstrating venous insufficiency in the treated segment.\nBoth laser wavelengths were effective in treating GSV insufficiency, with no major complications and a paucity of adverse outcomes.",

At 72 hours after the procedure, no significant differences were noted between patient outcomes, physical conditions, and symptoms and or possible adverse events. At 1 week after the procedure, bruising scores were significantly different (P < .005): patients in the 980-nm group showed less bruising of the procedure site than the patients in the 810-nm group. Only three physical or symptom parameters presented with significant differences (P < .05) over time-less itching was noted by 810 nm-treated patients at 3 weeks after the procedure, lower levels of pain intensity were seen in the 980 nm-treated patients at the 4-month follow-up visit, and lower varicose vein ratings were seen for the 980 nm-treated patients at the 4-month follow-up visit. Thirteen legs were phlebitic at 7 days after the procedure (10 in the 810-nm group and 3 in the 980-nm group). Two treatment failures occurred (one patient in each treatment group); both patients exhibited flow in the treated venous segment at the 4-month follow-up visit. Two other patients (one in each group) had treatment failure at the 1-year follow-up, demonstrating venous insufficiency in the treated segment.",

    "abstract": "To identify patient and physician-controlled treatment variables that might predict the persistence or redevelopment of saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) reflux.\nThirteen European centers, with substantial lower extremity venous disease practices, examined their experience with SFJ ligation and GSV stripping for primary varicose veins in patients followed for > or =2 years, entering their data into a protocol-driven matrix that stipulated duplex Doppler imaging as an essential component of follow-up examinations and required a complete review of all peri-operative examinations, as well as all operative procedure and anesthesia notes. Matrix entries were centrally audited for consistency and credibility, and queried for correction or clarification before being accepted into the study database. Presence or absence of Doppler-detectable SFJ reflux was the dependent variable and principal outcome measure.\nAmong 1,638 limbs, 315 (19.2%) had SFJ reflux. After adjustment for follow-up length and inputting for missing values, multivariable analysis identified seven significant predictors. Ultrasonic groin mapping (odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.40) and <3-cm groin incisions at or immediately below the groin crease (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.78) were both uniquely associated with diminished probability of follow-up SFJ reflux. Prior parity (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.45 to 4.97), body mass index >29 kg/m(2) (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.43), <3-cm suprainguinal incisions (OR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.70 to 5.88), stripping to the ankle (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.71 to 3.46), and interim pregnancy during follow-up (OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 2.47 to 9.12), were each independent predictors of a greater probability of having SFJ reflux.\nThe findings suggest that ultrasound groin mapping, reticence for short suprainguinal or longer groin incisions and extended stripping, and counseling women about the effect of future pregnancy are prudent clinical choices, especially for obese or previously parous patients.",

Forty-four patients underwent multislice helical computed tomographic angiography. Eight IJ injuries (two gunshot wounds and six stab wounds) with no other indication for neck exploration were identified and managed nonoperatively. One external wound was in zone 1, five were in zone 2, one was in zone 3, and one traversed all three zones. The average length of stay was 4.5 days. At follow-up, ranging from 1 week to 5 months, all patients were asymptomatic, and no patient required delayed operation for IJ injury.\nIn hemodynamically stable patients with no other indication for exploration, the nonoperative management of penetrating jugular vein injuries should be considered as a safe alternative.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that open repair of arterial injuries in very young children often leads to less satisfactory outcomes. The aim of this study is to describe a decade's experience in the management of pediatric arterial trauma of the limbs, with an additional specific objective to evaluate the long-term outcome of arterial traumas in preschool children treated conservatively.\nHospital charts were reviewed for all children aged < or =13 years with arterial trauma of the extremities who underwent operative or nonoperative treatment. Twenty-three children were located who had arterial traumas equally divided between the upper extremity (13) and lower extremity (10).\nThe method of treatment was either open surgical repair or medical treatment consisting of systematic heparin administration. In 11 of 12 school-aged children (>6 years; mean age, 10 years), open surgical repair was performed. In six of 11 preschool children (< or =6 years; mean, 3.2 years) medical treatment was offered. Open repair was deferred in all children <2.5 years. Autologous vein interposition grafting was the most common surgical procedure and was performed in 10 patients. There were no deaths, and 87% limb salvage (21/23) was achieved. Two patients, both in the surgical arm, underwent lower limb amputation. The long-term outcome of those treated conservatively was excellent in all but one child, in whom minor limb-length discrepancy was detected.\nSurgical repair can be performed in school-aged children as in adults. Surgical treatment of arterial injuries in neonates, infants, and those children <2.5 years old might best be deferred in ischemic but nonthreatened limbs. In a nonthreatened ischemic extremity in this age group, systemic heparinization is an alternative safe method of management. Limb loss is rare if distal Doppler signals are present; but as children grow, limb shortening is a threat. In preschool children, the risks of an open surgical repair must be weighed against any potential benefits.",

Data were obtained from the registry, patient records, phone correspondence, and written surveys.\nThere were 38 females and 4 males with a median age of 29 years (range, 12 to 56 years), and 32 (76%) were white. Sixty operations were performed for symptomatic disease. The mean duration of symptoms before operation was 5.6 months (range, 0 to 25 months). Thirteen (31%) patients had active disease and underwent operation for acute presentation or failure of medical management. Thirty-nine patients (93%) had operation for occlusive disease. Twenty-two (52%) patients had involvement of both the great and abdominal aortic branch vessels; 10 (24%) had great vessel disease alone; 9 (21%) had involvement of abdominal arteries; and 1 (2%) had coronary artery disease. There was no operative death, myocardial infarction, major stroke, or renal failure. Three patients had early graft thrombosis, two had a minor stroke, and two developed hyperperfusion syndrome. The median follow-up was 6.7 years (range, 1 month to 19.3 years). Eleven (26%) patients required 15 graft revisions; five of the patients had active disease at the time of initial operation. All early revisions (<1 year) were in patients with active disease. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, freedom from revision at 5 and 10 years was 100% in patients with quiescent disease not requiring steroids (group I, n = 5, 12%), 95% and 81% in patients whose disease was quiescent on steroids (group II, n = 24, 57%), 57% in patients with active disease on steroids (group III, n = 7, 17%), and 33% in patients with active disease and no long-term steroids (group IV, n = 6, 14%) (P < .006). The rate of revision or progression of disease at another site in 5 years was 0% in group 1, 10% in group 2, 57% in group 3, and 67% in group 4 (P < .001) The differences were even more pronounced when an analysis was done on the basis of disease activity alone, irrespective of steroid use. During the follow-up period, 3 of 39 great vessel, 2 of 18 mesenteric/renal, and 1 of 9 aortofemoropopliteal reconstructions occluded. The predicted mortality for patients was 4% at both 5 and 10 years (95% CI) respectively (confidence interval [CI], 0% to 11%) and 10 (CI, 0% to 14%) years, respectively.\nThe minority of patients with Takayasu's arteritis require operation. In our predominantly white female patient population, occlusive symptoms were the most common indication for operation. Operation for these selected patients was safe, with no operative mortality, myocardial infarction, major stroke, or renal failure. Patients with active disease requiring operation are more likely to require revision or develop progressive symptomatic disease at another site. Long-term survival is excellent, regardless of disease activity at the time of operation.",

    "abstract": "Wall shear stress, a local risk factor of atherosclerosis, is decreased in the common carotid artery of patients with vascular risk factors. We evaluated wall shear stress in the common carotid artery of patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). As blood viscosity is a determinant of wall shear stress, we further investigated the impact of rheologic variables on wall shear stress in relation to vascular risk factors and intima-media thickness.\nHigh-resolution ultrasonography scans were used to study intima-media thickness, internal diameter, and blood velocity in the common carotid artery of 31 patients with PAD, 36 patients with AAA, and 37 controls. Furthermore, major hemorheologic variables and vascular risk factors were evaluated, and wall shear stress was calculated.\nWall shear stress was lower in patients with PAD (median [IQR], dynes/cm(2): 14.4 [10 to 19]) and with AAA (12.1 [9 to 15]) than in healthy controls (20.6 [17 to 24]; P < .0001). Wall shear stress was inversely related to red cell aggregation (P = .01), fibrinogen (P = .003), leucocyte count (P = .001), plasma viscosity (P = .04), and intima-media thickness (P < .0001). Furthermore, wall shear stress was negatively associated with age, smoking, and triglycerides, but positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P < .001). When the influence of all these predictors were simultaneously taken into account in a multiple regression model, only age (P < .0001), smoking (P = .005), and triglycerides (P = .003) remained significantly associated with wall shear stress.\nThis is the first report, to our knowledge, showing that wall shear stress of the common carotid artery is decreased in patients with symptomatic PAD and in patients with AAA. Rheologic variables are less important in predicting wall shear stress than age, triglycerides, and smoking.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has established that performance on an endovascular simulator incorporating tactile feedback (haptics) correlates with previous endovascular experience and can be improved by training. This study was designed to test the ability to define and measure innate endovascular aptitude and empirically correct performance and to determine whether these are two different things.\nSubjects ranging in endovascular skill level from novice to expert were surveyed to determine video game experience and skill, endovascular level of training, and endovascular experience. They were then tested by using a standard protocol requiring timed advancement of a catheter and wire sequentially into each of three vessels arising from a simulated type I arch. Recorded trials were independently and blindly scored by two experienced endovascular faculty members by using a modification of a previously validated scale (Modified Reznick Scale; MRS). Summed scores were analyzed by frequency analysis and categorized as satisfactory and unsatisfactory on the basis of a clear bimodal distribution. Categorical outcome, time to task completion, and other variables were analyzed by means of linear regression, analysis of variance, and Welch modified two-sample t tests, as indicated.\nA total of 61 subjects were enrolled: 42% students, 8% technicians, 19% surgeons, 13% cardiologists, and 18% radiologists. Of these, 62% were considered novices and 30% experts on the basis of previous experience; 56% of subjects worked in an endovascular-related occupation. MRS scores were highly correlated between raters (P < .0001) and showed a clear bimodal distribution, with subjects in any endovascular occupation (including technicians) scoring significantly better than all others (P < .0001). Hours of video games played per week were correlated highly with completion times (P < .001) and MRS scores (P < .001). Measures of formal training (number of endovascular cases and occupation) correlated highly with completion times (all P < .03) and MRS scores (all P < .008). In comparing completion times vs MRS scores, three groups were apparent: unskilled-inexperienced, skilled-inexperienced, and skilled-experienced, corresponding primarily to senior subjects without endovascular experience, younger subjects without endovascular experience, and formally trained endovascular physicians, respectively. Those judged intermediate in aptitude reduced times to the lowest possible level before improving their MRS scores.\nAlthough inherently subjective, the MRS yields reproducible scores that correlate with endovascular experience and formal training. Experts and novices with extensive video game experience achieve short completion times, whereas high MRS scores are achieved only by formally trained subjects. Innate endovascular aptitude and empirically correct performance may be two separate things, and aptitude may be acquirable through (or identified by) extensive nonmedical video game experience.",

    "abstract": "Patients with intermittent lower limb claudication (IC) exhibit a prothrombotic diathesis that is acutely exacerbated by exercise. This may occur because of ischemia/reperfusion injury within the leg muscles during walking and may contribute to the increased risk of thrombotic vascular events in this group of patients. This randomized study compared the effect of lower limb revascularization by percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA), supervised exercise, and best medical therapy (BMT) alone on this prothrombotic state.\nTwenty-three patients (16 men and 7 women; median age, 67 years; range, 57-77 years) with IC due to infrainguinal disease were randomized to receive BMT alone (n = 7), BMT plus PTA (n = 9), or BMT plus supervised exercise (n = 7) as part of the Health Technology Assessment-funded EXercise vs Angioplasty in Claudication Trial (EXACT). Patients were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) was determined as a marker of thrombin generation, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) antigen was determined as a marker of fibrinolysis. Increased TAT indicates a procoagulant state, and increased PAI antigen indicates a hypofibrinolytic state.\nAt 6 months, subjects randomized to BMT plus PTA demonstrated a significant improvement in ankle-brachial pressure index (P = .013) and maximal walking distance (P = .008), a significant decline in resting thrombin generation (median [interquartile range] TAT, 6.4 microg/L [2.7-13.5 microg/L] to 1.5 microg/L [0.3-2.9 microg/L]; P = .038), and an improvement in resting fibrinolysis (median [interquartile range] PAI-1, 10.0 ng/mL [1.0-20.5 ng/mL] to 1.0 ng/mL [1.0-14.8 ng/mL]; P = .043). There was no significant change in any of these parameters in patients randomized to BMT plus supervised exercise or to BMT alone.\nThe addition of lower limb revascularization by PTA to BMT in patients with IC due to infra-inguinal disease results in a medium-term improvement in the resting procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state. This may translate into a reduction in morbidity and mortality from thrombotic vascular events in this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "The preferential use of endovascular techniques to treat complex aortoiliac disease has increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes and durability of recanalization, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and stenting for iliac occlusions based on the patient's TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) stratification.\nBetween 1998 and 2004, more than 628 patients with a clinical diagnosis of aortoiliac atherosclerotic disease underwent arteriography. The endovascular treatment of 89 consecutive patients (mean age, 66 years; 58% male) with symptomatic iliac occlusions (TASC-B, -C, and -D) was the basis for this study. Original angiographic imaging was evaluated for lesion grade and runoff. Electronic and hard copy medical records were reviewed for demographic data, clinical variables, and noninvasive vascular laboratory testing. Kaplan-Meier estimators were used to determine patency rates according to Society for Vascular Surgery criteria. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. P values of <.05 were considered significant.\nRecanalization and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting (total, 178 stents) of occluded iliac arteries was technically successful in 84 (91%) of 92 procedures. Patients in the TASC-C and -D groups often required multiple access sites (50%) and femoral artery endarterectomy/patch angioplasty for diffuse disease (24%). The mean ankle-brachial index increased from 0.45 to 0.83. Distal embolization led to major amputation and eventual death in one patient. Two other deaths occurred in the perioperative period secondary to cardiorespiratory causes. Three-year primary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates were 76%, 90%, and 97%, respectively, and progression of infrainguinal disease led to late limb loss in two patients. Diabetes as a risk factor was significantly associated with decreased primary patency (57% vs 83%; P = .049). Critical ischemia at presentation was associated with decreased patency rates as well (P = .002), but TASC classification did not significantly alter patency rates.\nComplex long-segment and bilateral iliac occlusions can be safely treated via endovascular means with high rates of symptom resolution. Initial technical success, low morbidity, and mid-term durability are comparable to results with open reconstruction. A liberal posture to open femoral artery reconstruction extends the ability to treat diffuse TASC-C and -D lesions via endovascular means.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair has emerged as a less-invasive treatment for descending thoracic aortic (DTA) aneurysms. However, the durability of this procedure relies on the stability of proximal and distal fixation sites. This study analyzes 3 years of computed tomography (CT) data on aortic neck morphology after endovascular DTA aneurysm repair.\nBetween 1999 and 2001, 139 patients underwent successful endovascular DTA repair as part of a prospective, multicenter clinical trial investigating the Gore TAG thoracic endoprosthesis. Contrast-enhanced, high-resolution CT scans were obtained at 1 (baseline), 12, 24, and 36 months and submitted to an independent core laboratory for image analysis. The aorta was carefully measured by using computerized planimetry and a standardized protocol. Neck diameter was measured at 10-mm intervals for 2 cm above and below the aneurysm and correlated with graft migration and endoleak.\nThe mean proximal neck diameter increased from a baseline of 30.2 +/- 4.6 mm to 32.0 +/- 4.3 mm at 36 months (P <.05), and the annual diameter increase was 0.8, 0.4, and 0.6 mm at 12, 24, and 36 months. The mean distal neck diameter increased from 29.4 +/- 3.8 mm to 32.1 +/- 5.0 mm at 36 months (P <.05), and the annual diameter increase was 1.1, 0.4, and 1.2 mm at 12, 24, and 36 months. At 36 months, freedom from neck dilation of > or =5 mm was 87%, and freedom from migration of > or =10 mm was 83%. An endoleak was present in 11 (9%) of 122 patients at baseline, 7 (7%) of 96 at 12 months, 6 (9%) of 68 at 24 months, and 1 (3%) of 33 at 36 months. Neck dilation was not associated with graft migration or endoleak.\nThree years after endovascular repair of DTA aneurysms, there is progressive enlargement of the proximal and distal aortic necks. Although uncommon for patients to develop significant neck dilation, when it does occur, it is not associated with graft migration or endoleak. Continued surveillance of aortic neck morphology after descending thoracic aneurysm endografting is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Although suprarenal fixation may be of benefit during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), its safety with regards to renal effects remains uncertain. To date, there has been no controlled study of the topic, with most reports relying upon single-center experiences that use heterogeneous patient populations and devices from different manufacturers. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the effect of suprarenal fixation on renal function by comparing homogeneous patient populations receiving EVAR grafts from a single manufacturer that are identical in design and delivery method, except for utilizing either suprarenal (SR) or infrarenal (IR) fixation.\nDuring two pivotal US Food and Drug Administration trials, 283 patients underwent EVAR with the Powerlink bifurcated graft. The trials' inclusion and exclusion criteria and grafts were identical except for fixation scheme. Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomographic (CT) data were retrospectively reviewed. A comparison of preoperative, perioperative (1 to 7 days), and postoperative (>7 days) alterations in serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), and blood pressure was performed. Renal adverse events were determined by CT scan and clinical chart review and included renal infarction, renal artery stenosis (either progressive or requiring renal stent placement), and renal artery occlusion.\nBoth SR and IR groups demonstrated a significant increase in SCr and a decrease in CrCl over time. No significant difference in SCr or CrCl existed between groups during any time period. There were no differences in postoperative renal impairment (IR, 10.2%; SR, 7.6%, P = .634), the need for hemodialysis (IR, 0.7%; SR, 0%, P = 1.00), or systolic and diastolic blood pressure during subsequent follow-up between treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the number of renal adverse events detected by CT between the IR (10, 6.8%) and SR (3, 3.8%) groups (P = .550).\nSuprarenal fixation does not lead to a significant increase in acute renal events, renal impairment, or alteration in blood pressure compared with infrarenal fixation. Patients undergoing aneurysm repair with devices that use either suprarenal or infrarenal fixation develop progressive renal dysfunction over time. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of suprarenal fixation on renal function and progression of renal artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Clinically evident renal disease is a risk factor for mortality after aneurysm repair. Serum creatinine is widely used as a measure of renal function in the preoperative evaluation of patients. Unfortunately, serum creatinine concentration is influenced by muscle mass, hydration status, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Calculated GFR, which takes predictors of muscle mass such as age, gender, and weight into account, is a more sensitive determinant of renal function than serum creatinine. We hypothesized that GFR would more accurately predict mortality after EVAR than serum creatinine.\nWe retrospectively evaluated our database of 398 patients who underwent EVAR with the AneuRx device between October 1999 and October 2004. There were 340 men and 58 women with a mean age of 73. GFR was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The patients were divided into four quartiles by preoperative GFR: I (7 to 45), II (45 to 60), III (61 to 79), and IV (> or =80). Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and heterogeneity of mortality across strata was evaluated using the log-rank test. The GFR quartiles were compared with clinically accepted criteria for abnormal renal function (serum creatinine level > or =1.7).\nActuarial survival at 48 months was 61.5%, 70.5%, 86.0%, and 85.7% for GFR quartiles I to IV, respectively (P < .003). Thirty-day mortality was 2.2% in quartile I, 3.2% in quartile II, and 0 in quartiles III and IV (P = .03 for q1 + q2 vs q3 + q4, P < .02 for q2 vs q3 + q4). Survival curves for quartiles II to IV were statistically indistinguishable, with quartile II running tangential to the two higher quartiles after the perioperative period. Quartile I fared significantly worse than the other three quartiles for the entire follow-up period (P < .005). According to American Kidney Foundation criteria (GFR <90), 83.3% of patients had abnormal renal function compared with 16.1% with abnormal serum creatinine (>1.7) (P < .0002).\nThe risk of perioperative and long-term mortality in patients undergoing EVAR is more accurately stratified by using calculated GFR than serum creatinine alone. A GFR <45 is associated with decreased survival after EVAR. Perioperative mortality at a GFR of 45 to 60 is comparable with that of the lower quartile (GFR <45), but late survival is comparable with that of patients with GFR >60. The finding of increased risk of early mortality in patients in the 45 to 60 GFR range, with survivors enjoying good long-term outcome, suggests that these patients may most benefit from the use of alternative contrast agents and periprocedural renal protection techniques.",

    "abstract": "Accessory renal arteries are frequently encountered when patients are evaluated for endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Some have considered their presence a contraindication to EVAR in fear of endoleak and the end result of renal function. We sought to determine whether the coverage of accessory renal arteries during EVAR was associated with any adverse sequelae.\nRetrospective review of the medical records and computed tomographic scans of all patients undergoing EVAR (1998 to 2003) was performed. Note was made of the presence or absence of accessory renal arteries, hypertension, and renal function. Preoperative computed tomographic images were compared with postoperative images to determine the presence of renal infarction. A control group of 26 consecutive patients without accessory renal arteries was used for comparison of the results of EVAR.\nEVAR was performed in 550 patients over the study interval. The mean follow-up was 16 months (range, 1-48 months). The average age was 74 years (range, 57-90 years). Thirty-five patients (6.6%; 32 male and 3 female) were documented to have accessory renal arteries; the average number of accessory arteries was 2 (range, 1-4). Bilateral accessory arteries were present in 13 patients: all but 1 patient (n = 34) had a left-sided accessory renal artery, and 23 had a right-sided accessory renal artery. EVAR was performed with a variety of endografts: AneuRx (n = 10), Talent (n = 7), PowerLink (n = 7), Zenith (n = 5), LifePath (n = 4), and Ancure (n = 2). There were no mortalities. Twelve endoleaks were documented: three type I, eight type II, and one type III. The accessory renal arteries were not implicated in any of the endoleaks, and none of these accessory vessels was embolized before or after EVAR. Seven patients (20%) had renal infarcts associated with EVAR that were noted on follow-up computed tomographic scans. The mean follow-up for patients with segmental infarction was 23 months (range, 8-48 months). Hypertensive status did not change in any patient in whom an accessory renal artery had been covered. The average serum creatinine was 1.08 mg/dL (range, 0.6-1.8 mg/dL) before EVAR in patients with accessory renal arteries covered by an endovascular graft and did not change significantly in response to EVAR. Serum creatinine increased almost twofold in two patients but spontaneously resolved in follow-up. The average preoperative creatinine clearance was 79 mL/min (range, 35-166 mL/min) in patients without an accessory renal artery and was 80 mL/min (range, 35-167 mL/min) after EVAR. The average preoperative creatinine clearance was 67 mL/min (range, 31-137 mL/min) in patients with an accessory renal artery and 68 mL/min (range, 45-83 mL/min) in patients with renal infarcts. None of the patients required temporary or permanent dialysis. There was no difference between control patients and patients with covered accessory renal arteries with respect to hypertensive status, presence of renal infarcts, serum creatinine, or creatinine clearance after EVAR.\nOcclusion of accessory renal arteries is not associated with clinically significant signs or symptoms, even in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency. Sacrifice of accessory renal arteries most commonly does not lead to detectable renal infarction, either clinically or radiographically. When segmental infarction of the kidney does result, it seems to be well tolerated in this group of patients. Accessory renal arteries were not found to contribute to endoleaks and should not be prophylactically embolized.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) sac shrinkage after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is considered to be evidence of clinical success. Exclusion of the sac from systemic pressure is the likely cause of shrinkage. We report our continuing clinical experience with the use of a permanently implantable, ultrasound-activated remote pressure transducer to measure intrasac pressure and its correlation with changes in sac diameter over time.\nOver a 22-month period, 21 patients underwent EVAR of an infrarenal AAA with implantation of an ultrasound-activated remote pressure transducer fixed to the outside of the stent-graft and exposed to the excluded aortic sac. Intrasac pressures were measured directly with an intravascular catheter and by the remote sensor at the time of stent-graft deployment. Follow-up sac pressures were measured by remote sensor and compared with systemic arterial pressure at every follow-up visit. Mean follow-up was 11.4 +/- 5.0 months (range, 1 to 26 months). Twenty patients had follow-up of > or =6 months. Mean pressure index (MPI) was calculated as the ratio of mean sac pressure to mean systemic pressure.\nPressures could be obtained at all visits in 15 of the 21 patients. Fourteen of these 15 patients had follow-up of at least 6 months. Aneurysm sac shrinkage of >5 mm was seen in seven (50%) of these 14 patients. No aneurysm enlargement was observed in any patient. The MPI was significantly lower in patients with sac shrinkage at 6 months and at final follow-up.\nEndovascular aneurysm repair results in marked reduction of sac pressure in most patients. Patients with aneurysm shrinkage after EVAR have significantly lower MPI; however, the absence of sac shrinkage does not imply persistent pressurization of the sac. Further clinical follow-up will delineate the role of long-term sac pressure monitoring in surveillance after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "This Clinical Update summarizes the results of larger case series, industry-sponsored registries, and randomized trials of carotid artery stenting (CAS). In >20 case series that studied >24,000 patients undergoing CAS, 51% of patients were symptomatic, most procedures (97%) resulted in successful stent deployment, and 30-day stroke rates varied from 1% to 8%, with a trend toward lower rates as experience and embolic protection device (EPD) use increased. In 12 industry-sponsored registries (none were published in peer-reviewed journals), 30-day stroke rates varied from 2% to 7%, and 30-day combined adverse events, including stroke, death, and myocardial infarction, were 3% to 9%. More than 12 randomized trials comparing CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have been initiated since 1998. Results have varied over time, depending on the population studied and the technology used. However, the largest and most recent results of the completed SAPPHIRE trial in high-risk patients undergoing CAS with the use of EPDs demonstrated that CAS is at least not inferior to CEA, with a 1-year combined adverse event rate of 12% for CAS and 20% for CEA (P = .05). Other ongoing trials will address not only whether CAS could be superior to CEA in high-risk patients but also, more importantly, whether CAS is beneficial in other subgroups, such as low-risk and asymptomatic patients.",

These injuries are often difficult to expose, and the associated hemorrhage further hinders visualization and subsequent repair. In this case, the use of an endovascular balloon from groin access controlled venous hemorrhage and permitted a primary repair of a torn left iliac vein. We believe that this approach is unique in that it uses a compliant, low-pressure balloon, thus preventing further iatrogenic injury in otherwise fragile venous structures and allowing direct access to the tear when exposure in the operative field is limited.",

A 78-year-old man presented with left eye amaurosis fugax 11 years after radical neck dissection and neck irradiation for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The patient underwent carotid artery stenting for a high-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Twenty months after the procedure, a pulsatile neck mass developed with intermittent arterial bleeding. After control of the bleeding, he underwent resection of the left carotid bifurcation, including the indwelling stent and reconstruction with a saphenous vein interposition graft. A pectoralis myocutaneous flap was used for wound closure. In this case, localized infection of the stented carotid artery led to mycotic degeneration, pseudoaneurysm formation, and erosion to the skin surface. As carotid artery stenting becomes more widely used, previously unreported late complications associated with this procedure are likely to become apparent, and continued close follow-up is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Primary vein incompetence is one of the most common diseases of the peripheral veins, but its pathogenesis is unknown. These veins present obvious congenital defects, and examination of gene expression profiles of the incompetent vein specimens may provide important clues. The aim of this study was to screen for genes affecting the primary vein incompetence phenotype and test the differential expression of certain genes.\nWe compared gene expression profiles of valvular areas from incompetent and normal great saphenous veins at the saphenofemoral junctions by fluorescent differential display reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (FDD RT-PCR). Differentially expressed complimentary DNAs (cDNAs) were confirmed by Northern blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Similarity of the cDNAs sequences to GenBank sequences was determined. Gene expression status was then determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical techniques.\nThere were >30 differentially expressed cDNA bands. Sequence analysis revealed that a cDNA fragment obviously downregulated in incompetent great saphenous vein was a portion of the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding desmuslin, a newly discovered intermittent filament protein. Northern blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a similar mRNA expression profile of the desmuslin gene in other samples. Western blotting and immunohistochemical techniques localized the desmuslin protein mainly in the cytoplasm of venous smooth muscle cells. The amount of desmuslin was greatly decreased in the smooth muscle cells of incompetent veins.\nThe expression of many genes is altered in primary vein incompetence. Up- or downregulation of these genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Desmuslin expression is downregulated in the abnormal veins. Its effect on the integrity of smooth muscle cells might be related to malformation of the vein wall. Further studies are needed to investigate other differentially expressed cDNAs and the exact role of desmuslin in this disease.\nPrimary vein incompetence is a frequent and refractory disease of the peripheral veins. Exploring its pathogenesis may enhance our comprehension and management of this disease. We used reliable techniques to detect disease-related genes and confirmed downregulation of desmuslin in abnormal veins. Alteration of these genes might be used as disease markers or gene therapy targets.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from prosthetic vascular grafts secrete higher levels of collagen than aortic SMCs under basal conditions and during incubation with oxidized low-density lipoprotein. We postulated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributed to the observed difference. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of ROS on collagen secretion by aortic and graft SMCs and explore the mechanism involved.\nSMCs isolated from canine aorta or Dacron thoracoabdominal grafts were incubated with 6-anilinoquinoline-5,8-quinone (LY83583), an agent that induces superoxide production. Type I collagen in the conditioned medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and superoxide anion production was measured by lucigenin assay.\nLY83583 stimulated a rapid increase in collagen production by graft SMCs that paralleled the LY83583-induced increase in superoxide production. The increase in both collagen and superoxide was greater in graft SMCs than aortic SMCs. Collagen and superoxide production were inhibited by superoxide scavengers. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) induced significantly more superoxide production by graft SMCs than aortic SMCs, suggesting that the NADPH oxidase system was more active in graft SMCs. NADPH oxidase inhibitors blocked the superoxide and collagen production induced by LY83583.\nIn SMCs, the synthetic phenotype is associated with increased NADPH oxidase activity and elevated superoxide production in response to an oxidative stress. Superoxide, in turn, leads to increased collagen production.\nThe inflammatory process after prosthetic vascular graft implantation causes oxidative stress that can stimulate collagen production by graft SMCs, contributing to the progression of intimal hyperplasia. The exaggerated response of graft SMCs to oxidative stress offers a potential target for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Defensins are cysteine-rich cationic polypeptides released from neutrophils that exhibit powerful antimicrobial activities. Because inflammation, including neutrophil infiltration and release of defensins, may play an important role in atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases, we determined whether alpha-defensin could cause endothelial dysfunction, a major initial event of atherosclerosis, in porcine coronary arteries.\nPorcine coronary arteries were sliced into 5-mm rings and treated with different concentrations of human recombinant alpha-defensin for 24 hours. Vasomotor reactivity was studied by using a myograph system. Levels of superoxide anion were detected by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively.\nEndothelium-dependent relaxation in response to bradykinin was significantly reduced by 40% for the rings treated with 1500 nM of alpha-defensin compared with controls (P< .05). Vessel contractility in response to the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 and endothelium-independent relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside were not affected with defensin treatment. In addition, the superoxide anion level at the endothelial layer of porcine coronary artery rings was significantly increased by 80% in the defensin-treated (1500 nM) vessels compared with controls (P< .05). Furthermore, the eNOS mRNA levels in endothelial cells isolated from the cultured rings treated with defensin (1500 nM) were significantly decreased by 27% compared with controls (P< .05). Immunoreactivity of eNOS in the defensin-treated vessel rings was also substantially reduced.\nDefensin reduces the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. This effect is associated with increased superoxide radical production and decreased eNOS expression in porcine coronary arteries.\nInflammation is an important mechanism of atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases. The roles and interactions of biomediators released from inflammatory cells are not fully understood, however. This study provides new information about effects and potential molecular mechanisms of a major neutrophil releasing factor, alpha-defensin, on endothelial dysfunction of porcine coronary arteries. Thus, targeting alpha-defensin and its associated molecular mechanisms may become a new strategy to prevent vascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Wrapping methods have been widely used to reinforce the anastomotic site in vascular surgery; however, postoperative changes in the aortic wall wrapped by nonbiodegradable felt have not been well characterized. The purposes of this investigation are to elucidate the sequelae of wrapping with nonbiodegradable felt on the aortic wall and to modify those changes by using biodegradable felt with or without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).\nThe descending thoracic aortas of 15 beagles were wrapped with three different materials: nonbiodegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt, biodegradable polyglycol acid (PGA) material, and PGA with 100 microg bFGF (n = 5 in each group). The descending thoracic aorta was resected after 3 months. The thickness of the aortic wall, vessel density in the media and the adventitia, and the wall strength were assessed. Untreated native aortic wall served as a normal control.\nThe thickness of the media of the PTFE group was lower than that of the PGA + bFGF group (66% +/- 5% vs 85% +/- 6% of control, P < .05). The adventitia-media ratio in the PTFE group decreased compared with controls (59.1% of normal, P < 0.05), whereas those in the PGA and PGA + bFGF groups increased (172.1% and 189.6% of normal, respectively, P < .01). The collagen-smooth muscle ratio in the media was higher in the PTFE group than in the controls (0.14 +/- 0.02 vs 0.07 +/- 0.01, P < .01). The number of vessels in the adventitia was higher in the PGA + bFGF group than those in PTFE or PGA groups (29.6 +/- 2.5/mm2 vs 6.4 +/- 0.8/mm2, 19.0 +/- 1.1/mm2, P < .01). The PGA + bFGF group demonstrated larger failure force than the PTFE group (4.0 +/- 0.3 kgf vs 1.6 +/- 0.3 kgf, P < .01). The failure stress in the PGA and PGA + bFGF groups was larger than that in PTFE group (PTFE:PGA + bFGF = 5.3 +/- 0.9 x10(2) kPa:11.7 +/- 1.7 x 10(2) kPa, P < .01; PTFE:PGA = 5.3 +/- 0.9 x 10(2) kPa:11.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(2) kPa, P < .05).\nThe aortic wall wrapped with nonbiodegradable PTFE felt showed a reduced thickness and diminished vessels in the adventitia. Biodegradable felt (PGA), with or without bFGF, modified these histologic changes. The vessel-rich thickened adventitia, after wrapping by PGA with bFGF, was associated with increased aortic wall strength.\nThis investigation was conducted in an attempt to elucidate mechanisms underlying the occurrence of late postoperative false aneurysm after aortic surgery. We hypothesized that sustaining compression of the aorta by the felt strip may cause structural derangement and local ischemia on the aortic wall. We used a simple wrapping of the aorta with a felt strip rather than a felt strip at anastomotic sites to simplify the experimental model and to exclude confounding factors brought by technical inconsistency on the surgical anastomosis. We further attempted to find a clue for preventing adverse effects of wrapping with a conventional felt strip. Practically, we pursued a possible application of a biodegradable felt strip to aortic wrapping in our experimental model before we proceed in a clinical application of the new material.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to define matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in the anterior and posterior wall of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and correlate it with specific computed tomography (CT) image sites within the descending thoracic aorta.\nSerial CT images of patients with TAAs were compared with age- and gender-matched normal descending thoracic aortas at levels T4-T12. The mean circumference of the TAAs was 153 mm (n = 12) and 148 mm (n = 11) at T8 and T10, respectively, compared with 75 mm (n = 12) and 75 mm (n = 10) in controls (P < .001). Aortic tissue was collected from a separate set of eight patients undergoing descending TAA resection (processed < or =12 hours of excision) and six cadavers (processed < or =24 hours of death). Tissue collected between the intercostals arteries was defined as posterior wall, and directly opposite was the anterior wall. MMP-9 and MMP-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) extracted from aortic tissue was analyzed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and normalized to beta-actin. Immunohistochemistry was performed for MMP-9 and MMP-2. CT aortic measurements and MMP expression were compared by t tests and analysis of variance, respectively.\nThe ratio of arc distance between the intercostals on the posterior wall to total aortic circumference was 0.14 in healthy controls compared with 0.08 in TAAs at vertebral level T8 (P = .001). At T10, the ratio was 0.15 in healthy controls compared with 0.11 in TAAs (P = .001). MMP-9 expression in TAAs was 4.3-fold higher in the anterior wall compared with the posterior wall (P = .03). Conversely, MMP-2 expression in TAAs was 3.2-fold higher in the posterior wall compared with the anterior wall (P = .008). MMP expression was not detected in control cadaver aortas.\nAnterior walls of expanding TAAs grow at a greater rate than the posterior wall, as determined from the lower ratio of intercostal arc distance to total circumference in TAAs. Differential MMP expression appears to be a biologic marker for asymmetric growth in the TAA wall.\nThe pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) is poorly understood. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of enzymes, are important in aneurysm development. Earlier experiments documented a regional variation of MMP-9 in stimulated rodent aortas, with production greater in the abdominal aorta compared with the thoracic aorta. The present study extends that observation and documents asymmetric aneurysm development in the TAA wall, with increased anterior wall growth in correlation to increased MMP-9 production. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which MMP production is regulated is critical.",

    "abstract": "The value of photoplethysmography (PPG) has been questioned because of a lack of reproducibility. We performed this study to determine whether new digital technology has improved the reproducibility of PPG in the noninvasive assessment of lower limb venous function in patients with isolated superficial venous reflux.\nThis was a prospective study of 140 legs in 110 patients (65% female; median age [interquartile range], 45 years [36-59.25 years]; CEAP clinical grade C2/3, n = 114; C4-6, n = 26) who underwent repeated digital PPG measurements of refilling time (RT) in both the sitting and standing position after standard exercise regimens by a single observer. RT was measured in all patients 2 to 5 minutes apart and in a randomly selected subgroup of 30 patients (38 limbs) 1 to 2 weeks apart. RT variability was assessed by using Bland and Altman's coefficient of repeatability (CR-RT), where the CR-RT was 1.96 times the standard deviation of the mean difference in RT between two tests. Venous duplex scanning of both the deep and superficial veins was also performed, and a reverse flow of greater than 0.5 seconds was considered abnormal. Only patients with isolated superficial venous reflux were included in the study.\nThe CR-RT of the tests on 140 limbs performed 2 to 5 minutes apart was 10 seconds overall, 3 seconds for RT up to 10 seconds, and 16 seconds for RT between 20 and 40 seconds. The CR-RT of the 38 tests performed 1 to 2 weeks apart was also 10 seconds. No systematic variation due to a nonrandom error was found between the measurements performed either 2 to 5 minutes or 1 to 2 weeks apart.\nDigital PPG performed in the seated position in patients with isolated superficial venous reflux provides a reproducible method for the noninvasive assessment of lower limb venous function for both clinical and research purposes. However, the variation in precision of RT with the magnitude of the measurement must be taken into account when results are interpreted in individual patients.",

A physical examination and a duplex ultrasound scan were performed at the first visit. This was repeated between 2 to 8 weeks after by the same physician and by another physician within the same time frame. The perforator, deep, and superficial veins systems as well as their accessories and tributaries were examined. A form based on the CEAP and the REVAS classification was used and the data were entered in a customized database.\nFourteen institutions enrolled 170 patients (199 lower limbs) in 1 year. Their mean age was 56 years, and 69% were women. Most of them had undergone one surgical procedure before enrollment (76.6%). Most had varicose veins and swelling (70.9%), and the rest had skin damage (29.1%). More than 90% had primary etiology. The saphenofemoral junction (47.2%) and leg perforators (54.7%) were the areas most often involved by recurrent reflux. Reflux in deep veins was detected in 27.4%. Class 2 (varicose veins) alone was present in 24.6% of limbs, two classes were present in 43%, and three in 24%.

    "abstract": "Bypass procedures have been the mainstay of treatment of extensive external iliac and superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease, particularly total occlusions. Since the early 1990s, reports from Europe have espoused the virtues of endarterectomy of the superficial femoral and iliac arteries from a small groin incision, but adoption in the United States has been limited. Over the past 4 years, we have explored the technical challenges and durability of this procedure and report our findings.\nRemote endarterectomy from an inguinal incision was the primary treatment option for all patients considered surgical candidates for vascular reconstruction of the external iliac and superficial femoral arteries. All data were entered into an outcomes database prospectively and reviewed retrospectively. After the procedure, duplex ultrasound surveillance was performed quarterly the first year and semi-annually thereafter.\nRemote endarterectomy was the planned procedure in 133 patients. The mean age was 68 years, 68% were men, and 31% were diabetic. The indications for the procedure were claudication in 57% and limb salvage in 43%. In 16 patients (12%), technical issues precluded the completion of the remote endarterectomy and a bypass was performed. Successful retrograde iliac endarterectomy was performed in 7 patients, SFA endarterectomy in 105 patients, and combined retrograde iliac and antegrade SFA in 5 patients. The average duration of the procedure was 162 minutes +/- 69 minutes (SD). Half of the patients were discharged on the first postoperative day, and the average length of stay was 2.52 days. The mean follow-up was 19 months, with a primary patency of 70% at 30 months by life-table analysis. Limb salvage was 94%.\nRemote endarterectomy is a viable and durable alternative to standard bypass procedures. It has equivalent patency to published results of bypass or endovascular procedures of the external iliac and superficial femoral arteries and may soon replace bypass as the preferred procedure for long-segment occlusions of these vessels.",

    "abstract": "Several prosthetic materials have been used for femoropopliteal bypass grafting in patients with peripheral vascular disease in whom a venous bypass is not possible. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is the most commonly used, but patency results have not always equaled those achieved with vein, especially in below-knee reconstructions. This study assessed the performance of a new heparin-bonded ePTFE vascular graft that was designed to provide resistance to thrombosis and thereby decrease early graft failures and possibly prolong patency.\nFrom June 2002 to June 2003, 86 patients (62 men and 24 women; mean age, 70 years; 99 diseased limbs) were enrolled prospectively in a nonrandomized, multicenter study of the heparin-bonded ePTFE graft. Fifty-five above-knee and 44 below-knee (including 21 femorocrural) procedures were performed. Follow-up evaluations consisted of clinical examinations, ultrasonographic studies, and distal pulse assessments. Patency and limb salvage rates were assessed by using life-table analyses.\nAll grafts were patent immediately after implantation. There were no graft infections or episodes of prolonged anastomotic bleeding. During the 1-year follow-up, 10 patients died, 15 grafts occluded, and 5 major amputations were performed. The overall primary and secondary 1-year patency rates were 82% and 97%, respectively. The limb salvage rate in patients with critical limb ischemia (n = 41) was 87%. Primary patency rates according to bypass type were 84%, 81%, and 74% for above-knee femoropopliteal, below-knee femoropopliteal, and femorocrural bypasses, respectively; the corresponding secondary patency rates were 96%, 100%, and 100%.\nIn this study, the heparin-bonded ePTFE graft provided promising early patency and limb salvage results, with no device-related complications, in patients with occlusive vascular disease. Longer-term and randomized studies are warranted to determine whether this graft provides results superior to those achieved with other prostheses, especially in patients at increased risk of early graft failure, such as those undergoing below-knee bypass and those with poor run-off or advanced vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as an acceptable treatment alternative in patients with carotid bifurcation disease. Although early results of CAS have been promising, long-term clinical outcomes remain less certain. We report herein the frequency, management, and clinical outcome of in-stent restenosis (ISR) after CAS at a single academic institution.\nClinical records of 208 CAS procedures in 188 patients with carotid stenosis of 80% or greater, including 48 (26.5%) asymptomatic patients, during a 42-month period were analyzed. Follow-up serial carotid duplex ultrasound scans were performed. Selective angiography and repeat intervention were performed when duplex ultrasound scans showed 80% or greater ISR. Treatment outcomes of ISR interventions were analyzed.\nOver a median 17-month follow-up, 33 (15.9%) ISRs of 60% or greater were found, according to the Doppler criteria. Among them, seven patients (3.4%) with a mean age of 68 years (range, 65-87 years) developed high-grade ISR (> or =80%), and they all underwent further endovascular interventions. Six patients with high-grade ISR were asymptomatic, whereas one remaining patient presented with a transient ischemic attack. Five of seven ISRs occurred within 12 months of CAS, and two occurred at 18 months' follow-up. Treatment indications for initial CAS in these seven patients included recurrent stenosis after CEA (n = 4), radiation-induced stenosis (n = 1), and high-cardiac-risk criteria (n = 2). Treatment modalities for ISR included balloon angioplasty alone (n = 1), cutting balloon angioplasty alone (n = 4), cutting balloon angioplasty with stent placement (n = 1), and balloon angioplasty with stent placement (n = 1). Technical success was achieved in all patients, and no periprocedural complications occurred. Two patients with post-CEA restenosis developed restenosis after ISR interventions, both of whom were successfully treated with cutting balloon angioplasty at 6 and 8 months. The remaining five patients showed an absence of recurrent stenosis or symptoms during a mean follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-37 months). By using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the freedom from 80% or greater ISR after CAS procedures at 12, 24, 36, and 42 months was 97%, 97%, 96%, and 94%, respectively.\nOur study showed that ISR after CAS remains uncommon. Successful treatment of ISR can be achieved by endovascular interventions, which incurred no instance of periprocedural complications in our series. Patients who developed ISR after CEA were likely to develop restenosis after IRS intervention. Diligent ultrasound follow-up scans are important after CAS, particularly in patients with post-CEA restenosis.",

    "results": "Over a median 17-month follow-up, 33 (15.9%) ISRs of 60% or greater were found, according to the Doppler criteria. Among them, seven patients (3.4%) with a mean age of 68 years (range, 65-87 years) developed high-grade ISR (> or =80%), and they all underwent further endovascular interventions. Six patients with high-grade ISR were asymptomatic, whereas one remaining patient presented with a transient ischemic attack. Five of seven ISRs occurred within 12 months of CAS, and two occurred at 18 months' follow-up. Treatment indications for initial CAS in these seven patients included recurrent stenosis after CEA (n = 4), radiation-induced stenosis (n = 1), and high-cardiac-risk criteria (n = 2). Treatment modalities for ISR included balloon angioplasty alone (n = 1), cutting balloon angioplasty alone (n = 4), cutting balloon angioplasty with stent placement (n = 1), and balloon angioplasty with stent placement (n = 1). Technical success was achieved in all patients, and no periprocedural complications occurred. Two patients with post-CEA restenosis developed restenosis after ISR interventions, both of whom were successfully treated with cutting balloon angioplasty at 6 and 8 months. The remaining five patients showed an absence of recurrent stenosis or symptoms during a mean follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-37 months). By using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the freedom from 80% or greater ISR after CAS procedures at 12, 24, 36, and 42 months was 97%, 97%, 96%, and 94%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting is an increasingly common endovascular treatment of carotid artery stenosis advocated in high-risk patients despite reports of increased adverse periprocedural outcomes in patients aged >80 years. We sought to evaluate our single institution experience with octogenarians and whether they have an increased incidence of major complications with carotid artery stenting.\nThree hundred eighty-six patients, including 260 patients from 10 regulatory trials, who underwent carotid artery stenting between June 1996 and March 2004 for symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis were reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Periprocedural (< or =30 days after carotid artery stenting) cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, and death outcomes were compared between 87 octogenarians and 295 nonoctogenarians. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for confounding factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis of stroke and death outcomes was performed for a 1-year follow-up.\nAll adverse outcomes were significantly higher in octogenarians compared with younger patients: 30-day stroke rate, 8.0% vs 2.7% (P = .02); 30-day stroke, myocardial infarction, or death, 9.2% vs 3.4% (P = .02). Cohorts were similar in terms of gender, comorbidities, antiplatelet medications, symptomatic status, and use of cerebral protection. Octogenarians had a greater incidence of contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion (26% vs 12%, P = .001), atrial fibrillation (21% vs 8%, P = .001), and congestive heart failure (28% vs 15%, P = .007), but a lower incidence of hypercholesterolemia (53% vs 72%, P = .001) and active smoking (8% vs 24%, P = .001). Multivariate analysis of 30-day major adverse outcomes demonstrated an association between age > or =80 and adverse outcome (odds ratio, 2.85; P = .043) as well as a protective effect of the preprocedural use of aspirin (odds ratio, 0.30, P = .027). At 1-year follow-up, only 75% of octogenarians and 87% of nonoctogenarians were free from stroke, myocardial infarction, or death (P = 005, Kaplan-Meier analysis).\nOctogenarians undergoing carotid artery stenting are at higher risk than nonoctogenarians for periprocedural complications, including neurologic events and death. Major event-free survival at 1 year is also significantly better in nonoctogenarians. These risks should be weighed when considering carotid stenting in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold standard for the treatment of carotid stenosis, but carotid angioplasty and stenting has been advocated in high-risk patients. The definition of such a population has been elusive, particularly because the data are largely retrospective. Our study examined results for CEA in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (both Veterans Affairs and private sector).\nNational Surgical Quality Improvement Program data were gathered prospectively for all patients undergoing primary isolated CEA during the interval 2000 to 2003 at 123 Veterans Affairs and 14 private sector academic medical centers. Study end points included the 30-day occurrence of any stroke, death, or cardiac event. A variety of clinical, demographic, and operative variables were assessed with multivariate models to identify risk factors associated with the composite (stroke, death, or cardiac event) end point. Adjudication of end points was by trained nurse reviewers (previously validated).\nA total of 13,622 CEAs were performed during the study period; 95% were on male patients, and 91% of cases were conducted within the Veterans Affairs sector. The average age was 68.6 +/- 0.1 years, and 42.1% of the population had no prior neurologic event. The composite stroke, death, or cardiac event rate was 4.0%; the stroke/death rate was 3.4%. Multivariate correlates of the composite outcome were (odds ratio, P value) as follows: deciles of age (1.13, .018), insulin-requiring diabetes (1.73, <.001), oral agent-controlled diabetes (1.39, .003), decade of pack-years smoking (1.04, >.001), history of transient ischemic attack (1.41, >.001), history of stroke (1.51, >.001), creatinine >1.5 mg/dL (1.48, >.001), hypoalbuminemia (1.49, >.001), and fourth quartile of operative time (1.44, >.001). Cardiopulmonary comorbid features did not affect the composite outcome in this model. Regional anesthesia was used in 2437 (18%) cases, with a resultant relative risk reduction for stroke (17%), death (24%), cardiac event (33%), and the composite outcome (31%; odds ratio, 0.69; P = .008).\nCarotid endarterectomy results across a spectrum of Veterans Affairs and private sector hospitals compare favorably to contemporary studies. These data will assist in selecting patients who are at an increased risk for adverse outcomes. Use of regional anesthetic significantly reduced perioperative complications in a risk-adjusted model, thus suggesting that it is the anesthetic of choice when CEA is performed in high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "The development of newer-generation endografts for the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms has resulted in considerable improvements in clinical performance. However, long-term outcome data are still scarce. To assess long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes after use of the Talent stent graft, a retrospective analysis was performed that was based on 165 patients treated with this endograft in Germany between October 1996 and December 1998.\nData were collected according to the recommendation of the ad hoc committee for standardized reporting practices in vascular surgery and were evaluated statistically by using univariate and multivariate analyses.\nA total of 165 patients were treated with a Talent endograft in 9 German centers before December 31, 1998. Most were asymptomatic (94.5%), male (97.6%), and treated with a bifurcated graft (86.7%). Two patients (1.2%) died within 30 days, and 28 (17%) died during the follow-up period. The cause of death was aneurysm rupture in one case. Survival was 95.4% +/- 1.7% at 1 year, 89% +/- 2.6% at 2 years, 78.1% +/- 3.6% at 5 years, and 76.2% +/- 4.1% at 7 years. Patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade IV had a significantly lower survival rate (24.9%) than those classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade II and III (91.9% and 77.3%). During a mean follow-up period of 53.2 +/- 20.1 months (range, 1-84 months), 47 secondary procedures were performed in 31 patients (18.8%). Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a freedom from secondary intervention of 94.7% +/- 1.8%, 81.7% +/- 3.3%, and 77.4% +/- 3.6% at 1, 3, and 7 years, respectively. The reason for secondary treatment was endograft thrombosis in 10 patients (6.1%), persisting primary endoleak in 9 (5.5%), late secondary endoleak in 6 (3.6%), graft migration in 3 (1.8%), aneurysm rupture in 2 (1.2%), and graft infection in 1 (0.6%). Device migration (> or =10 mm) occurred in seven patients (4.2%). Other graft changes, such as graft kinking (n = 4; 2.4%), fracture of metallic stents (n = 2; 1.2%), erosion of the longitudinal bar (n = 2; 1.2%), or modular component separation (n = 1; 0.6%), were rare. Follow-up computed tomographic imaging revealed a decrease of the maximum aneurysm sac diameter (>5 mm) in 106 (64.2%) patients and an increase in 14 (8.5%) patients. The mean aneurysm diameter significantly decreased (P < .001). Of the factors recorded at baseline, only endoleaks showed a significant correlation with the risk of aneurysm increase during follow-up (P < .001). Adverse anatomy (neck diameter >28 mm, neck length <15 mm, and '5 patent aortic branches) did not adversely influence the aneurysm shrinkage rate, the risk for a secondary procedure, or the clinical success rate. A significantly higher rate of clinical success (P < .05) was observed in patients older than 65 years of age.\nImplantation of the Talent endograft device is a safe and effective alternative to open surgery for exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysm. In comparison with first-generation grafts, the device showed superior durability for as long as 5 to 7 years after implantation. Even if prototypes of the Talent device were implanted in this study, the graft was also successfully used in most patients, even in those with adverse anatomy. Because improvements of the endograft have been made to address connecting bar breaks, a lower incidence of graft limb occlusion can be expected in the future.",

The reason for secondary treatment was endograft thrombosis in 10 patients (6.1%), persisting primary endoleak in 9 (5.5%), late secondary endoleak in 6 (3.6%), graft migration in 3 (1.8%), aneurysm rupture in 2 (1.2%), and graft infection in 1 (0.6%). Device migration (> or =10 mm) occurred in seven patients (4.2%). Other graft changes, such as graft kinking (n = 4; 2.4%), fracture of metallic stents (n = 2; 1.2%), erosion of the longitudinal bar (n = 2; 1.2%), or modular component separation (n = 1; 0.6%), were rare. Follow-up computed tomographic imaging revealed a decrease of the maximum aneurysm sac diameter (>5 mm) in 106 (64.2%) patients and an increase in 14 (8.5%) patients. The mean aneurysm diameter significantly decreased (P < .001). Of the factors recorded at baseline, only endoleaks showed a significant correlation with the risk of aneurysm increase during follow-up (P < .001). Adverse anatomy (neck diameter >28 mm, neck length <15 mm, and '5 patent aortic branches) did not adversely influence the aneurysm shrinkage rate, the risk for a secondary procedure, or the clinical success rate. A significantly higher rate of clinical success (P < .05) was observed in patients older than 65 years of age.",

    "abstract": "Totally percutaneous aortic aneurysm repair has been shown to be technically feasible, with low morbidity. Complications from percutaneous arterial closure are not insignificant, however, and can be fatal. We sought to evaluate our experience with this technique, compare it with the published literature, and identify factors associated with conversion to open repair and complications.\nA retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. All patients who underwent percutaneous closure of large-bore-sheath (>12F) access sites with off-label use of a suture-mediated closure device (Prostar XL) between December 2002 and August 2005 were reviewed. Outcome measures evaluated were rates of technical success, conversion to open femoral arterial repair, and complications. Axial diameter measurements of the accessed vessels were assessed with computed tomographic (CT) angiography both before and after the procedure. Patient variables were compared by using chi2, Fisher exact, and paired and independent samples t tests where appropriate. The mean follow-up interval was 1.5 years.\nDuring the study period, 49 patients underwent percutaneous closure of 79 large-bore-sheath access sites after successful endovascular aneurysm repair. Seven patients (14%) were morbidly obese (body mass index >35 kg/m2). Successful closure was achieved in 74 access sites (93.7%). Percutaneous closure was unsuccessful in five access sites (6.3%), all of which required open femoral repair at the same setting. Two converted patients experienced complications (4.1%): one retroperitoneal hematoma requiring transfusion of blood products and one iliac artery injury leading to death from myocardial infarction. Both of these patients were morbidly obese. Both complications occurred after closure of larger than 20F sheath sites. Morbid obesity and sheath size greater than 20F were associated with a significantly increased complication rate (P = .02 and P = .01, respectively). No thrombotic or infectious complications occurred in this series. Upon comparison of preoperative and postoperative CT angiograms, one (1.3%) small pseudoaneurysm was detected. No arteriovenous fistulas or hematomas larger than 3 cm were detected. The pseudoaneurysm occurred after closure of a 20F sheath access site. There were no significant differences in minimum intraluminal (7.38 +/- 1.8 vs 7.48 +/- 1.8) or maximum extraluminal (11.25 +/- 2.8 vs 12.02 +/- 2.7) diameters between preoperative and postoperative CT angiograms, respectively.\nTotally percutaneous aortic aneurysm repair is technically feasible in most cases, with no effect on the luminal diameter of the accessed femoral artery. Complications occur more often in morbidly obese patients and with sheaths larger than 20F. These complications can be minimized with meticulous technique and good patient selection. The capability for expeditious open femoral arterial repair is mandatory with this approach.",

    "abstract": "The effect of population screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease on morbidity and mortality has been comprehensively studied and reported. However, the effect of early AAA detection on suitability for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remains unknown. Considering the importance of such an effect on future health economics, we sought to assess the possible effect of AAA ultrasound surveillance on suitability for EVAR.\nThis was a prospective cohort study. From January 2002 to August 2003, consecutive AAA patients selected for open elective repair were placed into one of two groups according to mode of presentation. The first group included patients referred from a local well-established AAA ultrasound screening and surveillance program (ultrasound surveillance [AAA-S] group). The second group included patients referred from neighboring unscreened regions with incidentally diagnosed AAA (incidental [AAA-I] group). All patients underwent preoperative computed tomographic angiography. By using three-dimensional reconstruction software, computed tomographic images were assessed by two blinded observers for suitability for EVAR by using the criteria for a modular endovascular device.\nOf 74 patients included in the study, 41 were in the AAA-S group, and 31 were in the AAA-I group. The median aneurysm diameter was 72.3 mm (range, 50.7-83.7 mm) for AAA-I and 65 mm (range, 50.7-79.2 mm) for AAA-S (P < .47). Suitability for EVAR was 41% in the AAA-S group and 45% in the AAA-I group (P < .47).\nEarly detection and surveillance of AAA does not seem to increase suitability for EVAR. Suitability for EVAR seems to be determined early on in an aneurysm's life. On the basis of current device technology, referral for intervention from an AAA surveillance program may need to be initiated at a size well below 5.5 cm if an increase in EVAR suitability is to be expected.",

    "abstract": "Currently, postoperative endoleak surveillance after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is primarily done by computed tomography (CT). The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography scans to detect endoleaks by using a novel infusion method and compare these findings with those of CT angiography (CTA).\nTwenty male patients (mean age, 70.4 years) underwent surveillance utilizing both CTA and contrast-enhanced color Duplex imaging. One 3-mL vial of Optison (Perfluten Protein A microspheres for injection) and 57 mL normal saline, for a total of 60 mL, were administered to each patient as a continuous infusion at 4 mL/min via a peripheral vein. Each study was optimized with harmonic imaging, and a reduced mechanical index of 0.4 to 0.5, compression of 1 to 3, and a focal zone below the aorta to minimize microsphere rupture. One minute was allowed from the time of infusion to the appearance of contrast in the endograft. Flow was evaluated within the lumen of the graft and its components, as was the presence or absence of endoleaks. Findings were compared with standard color-flow Duplex imaging and CT utilizing CTA reconstruction protocols.\nAll patients evaluated had modular endografts implanted for elective aneurysm repair. Contrast-enhanced duplex scans identified nine endoleaks: one type I and eight type II. No additional endoleaks were seen on CTA. However, CTA failed to recognize three type II endoleaks seen by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The continuous infusion method allowed for longer and more detailed imaging. An average of 46.8 mL of the contrast infusion solution was used per patient.\nContrast enhanced Duplex ultrasonography accurately demonstrates endoleaks after EVAR and may be considered as a primary surveillance modality. Continuous infusion permits longer imaging time.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair mainly occurs in patients with Crawford extent I and II. We assessed the impact of monitoring spinal cord integrity and the subsequent adjusted surgical maneuvers on neurologic outcome in repairs of type I and II TAAAs.\nSurgical repair of TAAAs was performed in 112 consecutive patients with extent type I (n = 42) and type II (n = 70) aneurysms. The surgical protocol included cerebrospinal fluid drainage, moderate hypothermia, and left heart bypass with selective organ perfusion. Spinal cord function was assessed by means of monitoring motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Significant decreased MEPs always generated adjustments, including raising distal aortic and mean arterial pressure, reattachment of visible intercostal arteries, or endarterectomy of the excluded aortic segment with revascularization of back bleeding intercostal arteries.\nMotor evoked potential monitoring could be achieved in all patients. By maintaining a mean distal aortic pressure of 60 mm Hg, MEPs were adequate in 82% of patients. Increasing distal aortic pressure restored MEPs in all patients. In 19 patients (17%), MEPs decreased significantly during aortic cross-clamping because of critical spinal cord ischemia. MEPs returned in all patients after spinal cord blood flow was re-established except in three patients with type II TAAA in whom MEPs could not be restored, and absent MEPs at the end of the procedure corresponded with neurologic deficit. Delayed paraplegia developed in two patients owing to hemodynamic instability with insufficient mean arterial blood pressure to maintain adequate spinal cord perfusion.\nMonitoring MEPs is a highly reliable technique to assess spinal cord ischemia during TAAA repair. A surgical protocol including cerebrospinal fluid drainage, left heart bypass, and monitoring of MEPs can reduce the paraplegia rate significantly. Adjusted hemodynamic and surgical strategies induced by changes in MEPs could restore spinal cord ischemia in most patients, preventing early and late paraplegia in all type I patients. In type II patients, early paraplegia occurred in 4.2% and delayed neurologic deficit in 2.9%. Despite all available measures, complete prevention of paraplegia in type II aneurysms seems to be unrealistic.",

    "conclusions": "Monitoring MEPs is a highly reliable technique to assess spinal cord ischemia during TAAA repair. A surgical protocol including cerebrospinal fluid drainage, left heart bypass, and monitoring of MEPs can reduce the paraplegia rate significantly. Adjusted hemodynamic and surgical strategies induced by changes in MEPs could restore spinal cord ischemia in most patients, preventing early and late paraplegia in all type I patients. In type II patients, early paraplegia occurred in 4.2% and delayed neurologic deficit in 2.9%. Despite all available measures, complete prevention of paraplegia in type II aneurysms seems to be unrealistic.",

Increasing distal aortic pressure restored MEPs in all patients. In 19 patients (17%), MEPs decreased significantly during aortic cross-clamping because of critical spinal cord ischemia. MEPs returned in all patients after spinal cord blood flow was re-established except in three patients with type II TAAA in whom MEPs could not be restored, and absent MEPs at the end of the procedure corresponded with neurologic deficit. Delayed paraplegia developed in two patients owing to hemodynamic instability with insufficient mean arterial blood pressure to maintain adequate spinal cord perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has undergone vast changes in the last decade. We reviewed a national database to evaluate the effect on utilization of services and rupture rates.\nFrom the Centers for Medicare Services (CMS), a 5% inpatient sample was obtained for 1994 to 2003 as beneficiary encrypted files (5% BEF) and as a limited data set file after 2001. Files were translated into Microsoft Access by using a custom program. Queries were performed using International Classification of Diseases (9th Revision) (ICD-9) diagnosis codes 441.3 (ruptured AAA) or 441.4 (non-ruptured AAA) and ICD-9 procedure codes 38.34, 38.36, 38.44, 38.64, 39.25, 39.52 for open, and 39.71 (available after October 2000) for endovascular repair. The 5% BEF totals were multiplied by 20 to calculate yearly volumes. Total cases were divided into the yearly CMS population of elderly Medicare recipients for repair rates per capita and are reported as cases per 100,000 elderly Medicare recipients. Statistics were performed using chi2, Student's t test, nonparametric tests, and multiple regression analysis; P < or = .05 was considered significant.\nElective AAA repairs declined from 94.4/100,000 in 1994 to 87.7/100,000 in 2003. AAA rupture surgery declined from 18.7/100,000 (1994) to 13.6/100,000 (2003). Rupture repairs from 1994 to 2003 decreased by 29% for men and by 12% for women (P < .001). Rupture mortality has not changed, but the average is significantly higher for women at 52.8%, with men averaging 44.2% (P < .001). Mortality for elective AAA repair has decreased from 5.57% (1994) to 3.20% (2003) in men (P < .001) and from 7.48% (1994) to 5.45% (2003) in women (P < .001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated increasing age, female sex, and open surgery (vs endovascular) were significant predictors of elective and ruptured AAA repair mortality. For 2003 elective AAA repairs, the average length of stay was 6.9 days in men and 8.9 days in women (P < .01) For 2003, men were more likely to be discharged to home after rupture (32.9% of men vs 23.3% of women; P < .001) and elective repair (84.5% of men vs 70.1% of women; P < .001).\nImprovements in AAA management in the last decade have decreased aneurysm-related deaths and reduced the incidence of aneurysm ruptures, with a lower utilization of services. Women, however, continue to have a consistently higher mortality for open and ruptured AAA repair and are less likely to return to home after either.",

All patients undergoing AAA repair as coded by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) procedure code 38.44 and diagnosis codes 441.4 (intact) and 441.3/441.5 (ruptured) in California were identified. Patients <50 years of age were excluded. We determined in-hospital, 30-day, and 365-day mortality, and stratified our findings by patient age. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of mortality in the intact and ruptured AAA cohorts.\nWe identified 12,406 patients (9,778 intact, 2,628 ruptured). Mean patient age was 72.4 +/- 7.2 years (intact) and 73.9 +/- 8.2 (ruptured). Men comprised 80.9% of patients, and 90.8% of patients were white.

    "abstract": "The recent evolution in treatments for peripheral vascular disease has dated available mortality statistics for vascular intervention. Moreover, many of our current mortality statistics are derived from single-institution studies that are often not reflective of outcomes in general practice. To provide current and generalizable data regarding mortality and trends for peripheral vascular interventions, we examined two national data sets (Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 1998-2003, and National Hospital Discharge Survey, 1979-2003) and four states (New York, California, Florida, and New Jersey, 1998-2003).\nFour procedures--abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (nonruptured), lower extremity revascularization, amputation, and carotid revascularization--were selected by cross-referencing International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnostic and procedural codes. For significance, the t test was used for continuous variables, the chi2 test was used for dichotomous variables, and the chi2 test was used for mortality trends.\nFrom 1998 to 2003, there was a progressive decrease in the national per capita rate of amputations: 13.2% overall and 21.2% for major amputations (P < .0001). Nationally and regionally, mortality has only slightly declined. For lower extremity revascularization, after a sharp increase during the 1980s to 100,000 open procedures, the volume remained constant for 10 years and began to decline in 1998, reaching 70,000 cases in 2003. In contrast, since 1996, endovascular interventions have increased 40%. Mortality during the 1998 to 2003 period remained virtually stable at 1.5% to 2% for endovascular procedures and 3% to 4% for open procedures. The overall volume of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair has not changed substantially for the past 6 years; however, endovascular repair is now used for nearly half the cases (46.5% regional and 43.0% national). Mortality for open repair has not changed, remaining at approximately 5%, whereas for endovascular repair, mortality has declined from 2.6% in 2000 to less than 1.5% in 2003. After the rapid increase in open carotid revascularization in the early 1990s, the total volume has declined 5% nationally from 1998 to 2003. Regional data demonstrated an overall 12% reduction in carotid revascularization volume since 1998; this reduction was due to a 16% decline in open carotid revascularization. During this same period, the use of angioplasty-stent carotid revascularization doubled. Mortality for the open procedures is 0.5% and is significantly higher (2%-3%) for endovascular carotid revascularization. Stroke rates for endovascular carotid revascularization are also higher: 2.13% vs 1.28% for open procedures (P < .0001).\nDramatic shifts in the management of peripheral vascular disease have occurred together with an overall decline in mortality. There seems to be a significant mortality advantage for endovascular as compared with traditional surgery except for carotid endarterectomy. The increasing safety of vascular interventions should be considered when deciding which patients to treat but with the caveat that endovascular interventions are not always safer than open repair.",

Mortality for the open procedures is 0.5% and is significantly higher (2%-3%) for endovascular carotid revascularization. Stroke rates for endovascular carotid revascularization are also higher: 2.13% vs 1.28% for open procedures (P < .0001).",

    "abstract": "Endograft limb extension to the external iliac artery with embolization of an internal iliac artery (IIA) may be necessary in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) extending to the common iliac artery to prevent endoleak during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Coil embolization of the IIA can be performed at the same operative setting as EVAR or, alternatively, as a staged procedure. Most interventionalists favor the latter approach to avoid excessive contrast material and prolonged operative time. We investigated the clinical outcome of concomitant vs staged unilateral IIA embolization in the setting of EVAR.\nVascular surgeons at our institution treated 24 patients with infrarenal EVAR and unilateral coil embolization of the IIA from October 1, 2000 to June 30, 2005. All patients had normal renal function. The details of the operative procedure and perioperative complications were compared in patients undergoing concomitant vs staged procedures. Follow up was 1 to 40 months (average, 11 months).\nAmong the 24, 16 underwent concomitant unilateral IIA embolization in the setting of EVAR and eight patients underwent the staged procedure. Average duration of operative time (298 vs 284 minutes), amount of intravenous contrast (215 mL vs 164 mL), and preoperative (1.12 vs 1.26 mg/dL), and postoperative (1.15 v. 1.31 mg/dl) creatinine levels were similar in the concomitant vs staged group, respectively (P > .05 for all factors). More sensitive markers of renal insufficiency such as creatinine clearance were not measured. In the concomitant group, 25% (4/16) of patients reported significant symptoms of buttock claudication ipsilateral to the embolized IIA, which resolved after a mean of 8.8 months (range, 1 to 15 months) vs no cases (0/8) in the staged group (P = .02048). One patient in the staged group developed ischemic colitis, which was treated conservatively. Coil embolizations that were performed as staged procedures were all done on an outpatient basis. All 24 patients were admitted the day of the EVAR and were discharged the next day, except one patient in the concomitant group was discharged the second day after the procedure, and one patient in the staged group was discharged 7 days after the procedure.\nDespite concern of prolonged operative time and the amount of contrast needed to perform concomitant IIA embolization and EVAR, our results showed that in patients with normal renal function, concomitant unilateral IIA embolization in the setting of EVAR was safe and effective and associated with shorter hospitalization compared with staged procedures. The disadvantage of a concomitant procedure is an increased likelihood of transient buttock claudication, but the small number of patients in this series prohibits definite conclusions about this complication. The concomitant procedure may be preferable for infirm patients with normal renal function who would be greatly inconvenienced by two procedures.",

In four recent longitudinal studies, the 30-day incidence of death in such patients was 3% to 6%, and the incidence of myocardial infarction was 5% to 14%. Growing evidence suggests that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, including those undergoing vascular surgery.

A 52-year-old man with sudden hemiparesis of the right side was found to have an aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery and concomitant multiple aneurysms of the extrahepatic, celiac, and superior mesenteric arteries. Reconstructive operations using autologous vein graft were performed to treat the aneurysms. The histopathology analyses of resected arterial and aneurysmal specimens showed characteristics consistent with SAM. To our knowledge, a successfully treated case of SAM affecting both the carotid artery and visceral arteries has not previously been described.",

    "abstract": "We report two cases of proximal endograft collapse with an almost complete aortic occlusion after endovascular tube-graft treatment of thoracic aortic disease (thoracic aneurysm after a type B dissection, traumatic blunt aortic rupture) using the TAG Gore system. Oversizing of endografts is known to cause this complication. In our two cases, however, the oversizing was between 12% and 21.7%, which is less than the allowed oversizing of 25% that is recommended by the manufacturer. This endograft-related complication might be due to a poor alignment of the currently available endografts in highly angulated and tight aortic arches. In the first case, a combined endovascular and open emergent repair procedure achieved a reopening of the proximal endograft by proximal extension (TAG Gore). In the second case, proximal extension was not considered owing to a precise positioning of the endograft distal to the left carotid artery. A balloon-expanding Palmaz stent was therefore placed interventionally in the proximal part of the TAG graft to expand the endograft and to avoid another collapse of the device. This proximal endograft collapse has to be acknowledged as a potentially hazardous complication. We therefore recommend that the proximal part of thoracic endografts in the aortic arch should be closely monitored and we offer two possible endovascular solutions for resolving the problem of proximal endograft collapse.",

Caval thrombi were also formed in CCR2-/- and MCP1-/- mice and in wild-type mice transfected with an adenoviral construct expressing a broad-spectrum CC receptor antagonist.\nDirect administration of peritoneal macrophages decreased thrombus size by more than fivefold and increased recanalization by more than fourfold compared with controls (P < .001). A 100-ng MCP1dose reduced thrombus size by more than sixfold (P < .01) and increased recanalization by more than sevenfold (P < .01), without affecting macrophage recruitment. Deletion of CCR2 or blockade of all CC chemokines inhibited both monocyte recruitment (P < .05) and thrombus resolution (P < .01), but knocking out MCP-1 had no effect.\nIncreasing macrophage numbers in the thrombus enhances its resolution. MCP1 treatment enhances resolution by stimulating recanalization, independent of an effect on monocyte recruitment. CCR2 deficiency has the same effect as blockade of all CC chemokines. CCR2 receptor activation may therefore be an important mechanism in monocyte recruitment into venous thrombi and could be targeted to promote their resolution.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory responses are considered to represent a unique property after stent implantation, and we previously demonstrated that inflammatory signaling involving tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) contributes to neointimal formation in a balloon injury model of rabbit carotid artery. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of TRAF6 in in-stent lesion formation after stent implantation in the rabbit carotid artery.\nRabbit carotid arteries were injured with a 2F Fogarty catheter, and 28 days later, the same arteries were implanted with a 3-mm-diameter Palmaz-Schatz stent. A dominant negative (DN) form of TRAF6 (pME-FLAG-T6deltaRZ5) was then transferred using a plasmid-based electroporation method. Its effects were evaluated compared with the findings in arteries treated with control plasmid (pME-FLAG).\nImmunostaining with anti-FLAG tag antibody showed that an expression plasmid vector containing the DN-TRAF6 sequence was successfully transferred to the arterial intima and media. Morphometric analyses revealed that the increase of intimal area in in-stent lesions was significantly inhibited by DN-TRAF6 14 days after stent implantation (DN-TRAF6 group, 3.01 +/- 0.25 x 10(5) microm2 vs control group, 4.25 +/- 0.23 x 10(5) microm2, P < .01), and the cell density was increased compared with that in the control group. In the DN-TRAF6 plasmid-treated vessels, cell replication was prevented in both the intima and media, and fewer leukocytes adhered to the luminal surface. Moreover, DN-TRAF6 suppressed macrophage infiltration, activation of proteases, and proteoglycan accumulation in the in-stent intima.\nThese findings suggest that TRAF6 plays an important role in cell replication, inflammatory cell infiltration, protease activity, and extracellular matrix accumulation that contributes to in-stent lesion development.",

    "abstract": "The patency of small-diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts for vascular reconstruction is impaired by acute thrombotic occlusion. Prosthetic materials are thrombogenic and cause platelet adhesion and activation of the coagulation cascade. Heparin is a potent anticoagulant drug widely used to prevent and treat thrombosis. A new ePTFE graft with long-term bonding of heparin is now commercially available in several European countries, but a basic analysis of its mechanism of action in humans has never been performed. This study was performed to evaluate the thrombogenicity of heparin-bonded ePTFE grafts compared with standard ePTFE in a newly developed human ex vivo model.\nNonanticoagulated blood was drawn from antecubital veins of 10 healthy donors with a 19-gauge needle. The proximal end of a 60-cm ePTFE vascular graft with a diameter of 3 mm was connected to the needle while the distal end was connected to a syringe, which was placed in a syringe pump. Every volunteer served as his or her own control by using a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft on one arm and a standard ePTFE graft on the other arm. The perfusions were performed over 6 minutes with a flow rate of 20 mL/min, corresponding to a shear rate of 74/s. Serial samples were taken at the distal end of the graft for determination of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, fibrinopeptide A, and P-selectin expression on perfused platelets. Fibrin deposition and platelet deposition were studied by using scanning electronic microscopy.\nFibrinopeptide A production over time was significantly reduced on the heparin-bonded ePTFE grafts compared with standard ePTFE grafts (P < .05). There was no increase in the production of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 or P selectin over time on either type of graft. Scanning electronic microscopy scanning showed platelet deposition and fibrin formation on standard ePTFE grafts, whereas no platelets or fibrin were observed on heparin-bonded ePTFE grafts.\nHeparin immobilization substantially reduces the thrombogenicity of small-diameter ePTFE in a newly developed human ex vivo model. In this study, we provide evidence that the mechanism of action of the heparin bonding is due not only to anticoagulant but also to antiplatelet effects. Heparin bonding may be an important improvement of ePTFE, resulting in better patency rates for vascular reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "Renal insufficiency continues to be complication that can affect patients after treatment for suprarenal aneurysms and renal artery occlusive disease. One proposed mechanism of renal injury after suprarenal aortic clamping (above the superior mesenteric artery) and reperfusion (SMA-SRACR) is the loss of microvascular renal blood flow with subsequent loss of renal function. This study examines the hypothesis that the loss of medullary and cortical microvascular blood flow following SMA-SRACR is due to oxygen-derived free radical down-regulation of endogenous medullary and cortical nitric oxide synthesis.\nAnesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (about 350 g) either had microdialysis probes or laser Doppler fibers inserted into the renal cortex (depth of 2 mm) and into the renal medulla (depth of 4 mm). Laser Doppler blood flow was continuously monitored. The microdialysis probes were connected to a syringe pump and perfused in vivo at 3 microL/min with lactated Ringer's solution. The animals were subjected to SMA-SRACR (or sham) for 30 minutes, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Laser Doppler blood flow after the 30 minutes of SMA-SRACR followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion was compared with the time zero (basal) and with the corresponding sham group and reported as percent change compared with the time zero baseline. The microdialysis fluid was collected at time zero (basal) and compared with the dialysis fluid collected after 30 minutes of SMA-SRACR followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion as well as the corresponding sham group. The microdialysis dialysate was analyzed for total nitric oxide (microM) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) (PGI2 metabolite), and thromboxane B2 synthesis. The data are reported as percent change compared with the baseline time zero. The laser Doppler blood flow and microdialysis groups were treated with either saline carrier, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) (30 mg/kg, nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor), L-arginine (400 mg/kg, nitric oxide precursor), superoxide dismutase (SOD, 10,000 U/kg, oxygen-derived free radical scavenger), L-NAME + SOD, or L-arginine + SOD. SOD was given 30 minutes before the reperfusion, and the other drugs were given 15 minutes before reperfusion. The renal cortex and medulla were separated and analyzed for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2, prostacyclin synthase, and PGE2 synthase content by Western blot.\nSuperior mesenteric artery-SRACR caused a marked decrease in medullary and cortical blood flow with a concomitant decrease in endogenous medullary and cortical nitric oxide synthesis. These changes were further accentuated by L-NAME treatment but restored toward sham levels by L-arginine treatment after SMA-SRACR. The kidney appeared to compensate for these changes by increasing cortical and medullary PGE2 synthesis and release. SOD treatment restored renal cortical and medullary nitric oxide synthesis and blood flow in the ischemia-reperfusion group and in the ischemia-reperfusion group treated with L-NAME.\nThese data show that nitric oxide is important in maintaining renal cortical and medullary blood flow and nitric oxide synthesis. These data also support the hypothesis that the loss of medullary and cortical microvascular blood flow following SRACR is due in part to oxygen-derived free radical downregulation of endogenous medullary and cortical nitric oxide synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the biomechanical properties of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall tissue from patients who experienced AAA rupture with that of those who received elective repair.\nRectangular, circumferentially oriented AAA wall specimens (approximately 2.5 cm x 7 mm) were obtained fresh from the operating room from patients undergoing surgical repair. The width and thickness were measured for each specimen by using a laser micrometer before testing to failure with a uniaxial tensile testing system. The force and deformation applied to each specimen were measured continuously during testing, and the data were converted to stress and stretch ratio. The tensile strength was taken as the peak stress obtained before specimen failure, and the distensibility was taken as the stretch ratio at failure. The maximum tangential modulus and average modulus were also computed according to the peak and average slope of the stress-stretch ratio curve.\nTwenty-six specimens were obtained from 16 patients (aged 73 +/- 3 years [mean +/- SEM]) undergoing elective repair of their AAA (diameter, 7.0 +/- 0.5 cm). Thirteen specimens were resected from nine patients (aged 73 +/- 3 years; P = not significant in comparison to the electively repaired AAAs) during repair of their ruptured AAA (diameter, 7.8 +/- 0.6 cm; P = not significant). A significant difference was noted in wall thickness between ruptured and elective AAAs: 3.6 +/- 0.3 mm vs 2.5 +/- 0.1 mm, respectively (P < .001). The tensile strength of the ruptured tissue was found to be lower than that for the electively repaired tissue (54 +/- 6 N/cm2 vs 82 +/- 9.0 N/cm2; P = .04). Considering all specimens, no significant correlation was noted between tensile strength and diameter (R = -0.10; P = .55). Tensile strength, however, had a significant negative correlation with wall thickness (R = -0.42; P < .05) and a significant positive correlation with the tissue maximum tangential modulus (R = 0.76; P < .05).\nOur data suggest that AAA rupture is associated with aortic wall weakening, but not with wall stiffening. A widely accepted indicator for risk of aneurysm rupture is the maximum transverse diameter. Our results suggest that AAA wall strength, in large aneurysms, is not related to the maximum transverse diameter. Rather, wall thickness or stiffness may be a better predictor of rupture for large AAAs.",

To our knowledge, no previous attempt has been made to correlate the clinical severity of venous disease based on the CEAP classification with the capillary morphology changes. The purpose of this study was to correlate the clinical severity with the capillary morphology changes in patients with chronic venous disease by using capillary microscopy and to explore the significance of atypical capillary morphology in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins.\nPatients attending the vascular clinic for management of chronic venous disease were examined clinically and by duplex ultrasonography scans, and they were assigned to the appropriate CEAP clinical stage (C1, n = 15; C2, n = 20; C3, n = 15; C4a, n = 15; C4b, n = 15; C5, n = 15). Also studied were 10 control subjects with no arterial or venous disease of the lower limb.

The capillary density and capillary convolutions were counted in a 2.4 mm2 region of skin. In part 2 of the study, a further 33 C2 and C3 patients were studied to provide more detailed information on a small subgroup with unusual capillary morphology.\nIn part 1 of the study, the capillary count was similar in controls and patients in CEAP stages C2 to C4a, but decreased in patients of groups C4b and C5 (median count: C2, 15; C4b, 4; and C5, 7).

    "abstract": "To determine the patterns by which perforator vein (PV) reflux develops in patients with primary chronic venous disease (CVD).\nPatients with CVD who had at least two examinations with duplex ultrasonography before any treatment were included in this study. These were patients who were offered an operation at their first visit, but for various reasons treatment was postponed. All affected limbs were classified by the CEAP classification system. A detailed map of normal and refluxing sites was drawn on an anatomic chart by using several landmarks of the skin, muscle, and bone. Reflux was induced by distal limb compression followed by sudden release by using rapid-inflation pneumatic cuffs and dorsiplantar flexion. All new reflux sites were documented. The PV reflux was divided into ascending type, descending type (re-entry flow), and those that developed in new locations, which did not have reflux in any system at that level.\nThe total number of patients studied was 127 (158 limbs). There were 29 limbs (18%) in 26 patients with reflux development in the PV. In total, 38 new incompetent PVs were identified. The median time for the examination was 25 months (range, 9-52 months). Reflux in a previously normal PV at a re-entry site was detected in 15, in an ascending manner from an extension of superficial vein reflux in 18, and in a new, previously intact location in 5. At the new sites, reflux in the superficial veins connected to the incompetent PVs was always present. PVs connected to the great saphenous vein system were most common (n = 27), followed by those connected to short saphenous (n = 8) and nonsaphenous (n = 3) veins. Worsening in the clinical class was observed in 11 limbs: 5 from class 2 to 3, 2 from class 2 to 4, 2 from class 3 to 4, and 2 from class 4 to 6. The worsening could not be attributed to the PV reflux alone, because other veins became incompetent as well.\nReflux in PVs develops in ascending fashion through the superficial veins, at re-entry points, and at new sites. Worsening of CVD is observed with new PV reflux, but many other factors play a major role, and therefore a causative association is difficult to prove.",

    "abstract": "Current techniques to treat venous ulcerations and patients with severe lipodermatosclerosis include the elimination of incompetent perforator veins by open surgical ligation and division or by subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery. An alternative and less invasive means to obliterate perforator veins is ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy (UGS). We hypothesize that UGS is a clinically effective means of eliminating perforator veins and results in improvement of the clinical state (scores) without the complications associated with other more invasive methods.\nBetween January 2000 and March 2004, UGS was used to treat chronic venous insufficiency in 80 limbs of 68 patients. This was a clinical series of patients who had perforator incompetence and no previous surgery for venous disease < or = 2 years of their UGS procedure. Most had perforator disease without coexisting axial reflux of the saphenous or deep venous systems. Color flow duplex scanning was used to identify incompetent perforator veins in the calf, and duplex guidance was used to inject each perforator with the liquid sclerosant sodium morrhuate (5%). Patients were restudied by duplex scanning up to 5 years after treatment. Clinical results were determined by Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and Venous Disability Score (VDS) before and after treatment.\nOf the 80 limbs treated with UGS, 98% of incompetent perforators were successfully obliterated at the time of treatment, and 75% of limbs showed persistent occlusion of perforators and remained clinically improved with a mean follow-up of 20.1 months. According to the CEAP classification, there were 46.2% with limb ulceration or C6, 1.2% C5, 28.7% C4, 17.5% C3, and 6.2% C2 with pain isolated to the site of the perforator(s). Of those who returned for follow-up, the VCSSs changed from a median of 8 before treatment (95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 15) to a median of 2 after treatment (95% CI, 0 to 7) (P < .01). Likewise, VDSs dropped from a median of 4 before treatment (95% CI, 1 to 3) to 1 after treatment (95% CI, 0 to 2) (P < .01). There were no cases of deep vein thrombosis involving the deep vein adjacent to the perforator injected. One patient had skin complications with skin necrosis. Perforator recurrence was found more frequently in those with ulcerations than those without.\nUGS is an effective and durable method of eliminating incompetent perforator veins and results in significant reduction of symptoms and signs as determined by venous clinical scores. As an alternative to open interruption or subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery, UGS may lead to fewer skin and wound healing complications. Perforator recurrence occurs particularly in those with ulcerations, and therefore, surveillance duplex scanning after UGS and repeat injections may be needed.",

Of those who returned for follow-up, the VCSSs changed from a median of 8 before treatment (95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 15) to a median of 2 after treatment (95% CI, 0 to 7) (P < .01). Likewise, VDSs dropped from a median of 4 before treatment (95% CI, 1 to 3) to 1 after treatment (95% CI, 0 to 2) (P < .01). There were no cases of deep vein thrombosis involving the deep vein adjacent to the perforator injected. One patient had skin complications with skin necrosis. Perforator recurrence was found more frequently in those with ulcerations than those without.",

    "abstract": "Subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) and superficial vein surgery (SVS) have been the recommended treatment for advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), despite a high prevalence of deep vein reflux in these patients. The anatomic and hemodynamic results of these procedures, however, remain uncertain. It is hypothesized that concomitant SEPS and SVS would result in a reduction of deep vein reflux in patients with advanced primary CVI. We investigated the effect of concomitant SEPS and SVS on deep vein reflux as well as the associated hemodynamic and clinical changes after surgery in a cohort of patients with advanced primary CVI.\nWe prospectively evaluated 53 consecutive SEPSs with concomitant SVS procedures in 47 patients with advanced primary CVI. There were 25 men and 22 women with a mean age of 58 years at operation. Thirty-four procedures (64%) were performed for limbs with active venous ulcers (class 6), and the other 19 procedures were performed for 15 class 5 limbs, one class 4a limb, and three class 4b limbs, respectively. Duplex scan and air plethysmography were performed before operation, at 1 month, and at 1 year after operation. The patients were followed up regularly with clinical assessment, and the ulcer healing and recurrence rates were documented.\nThe proportion of limbs with common femoral vein incompetence decreased from 68% to 28% at 1 month and to 32% at 1 year after operation. The proportion of limbs with deep vein incompetence at more than one site also decreased from 42% to 15% at 1 month and to 12% at 1 year after concomitant SEPS and SVS. Venous hemodynamics as measured by air plethysmography improved significantly after operation. The cumulative ulcer healing was 85% at 3 months and 97% at 6 months. With a mean follow-up of 31 +/- 16 months, all ulcers healed. Only three recurrent ulcers (6%) were detected during the follow-up period.\nConcomitant SEPS and SVS are effective in reducing deep vein reflux and results in hemodynamic and clinical improvements in patients with advanced primary CVI. Deep vein reconstruction procedures may not be necessary in these patients.",

    "abstract": "There is growing focus on surgical technical competence and the means by which we are able to measure it. Ongoing studies have shown a plateau effect with increasing experience of the operator. The aim of this study was to assess the technical competence of five groups of surgeons with increasing experience and validate a new rating tool for use in surgical assessment.\nFifty surgeons performed a saphenofemoral junction ligation on a synthetic groin model. The procedure was videotaped, blinded, and reviewed independently by three assessors. Performance was assessed using a previously validated global rating scale of generic surgical skill. In addition, each procedure was rated with the procedure-specific Imperial College Evaluation of Procedure-Specific Skill (ICEPS) rating scale to establish the construct validity (ability to differentiate on the basis of skill) and inter-observer reliability.\nBoth rating scales showed improved scores with ascending grades (P < .001) and demonstrated a high inter-observer reliability both for generic and procedure-specific skill (alpha = 0.97 and alpha = 0.96, respectively). Total operative scores demonstrated significant differences between surgeons in postgraduate years 1 and 2 and surgeons in years 3 and 4 and also between newly appointed and experienced consultants (P < .041). Procedure-specific performance showed a plateau effect at the registrar level. Generic skill continued to improve, and significant differences were seen between newly appointed and senior consultants (P < .026).\nThis study shows that surgical performance continues to improve significantly beyond consultancy, and the data suggest that generic and procedural performance continue to improve, with significant improvement in the former with increasing experience. The ICEPS rating scale demonstrates construct validity and a high inter-observer reliability supporting its use in formative and summative assessment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the incidence, health care resource utilization, and economic burden associated with perioperative myocardial ischemic injury (PMII) in high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac vascular surgery.\nTwo hundred thirty-six patients consented to participate in a pharmacoeconomic substudy as part of a randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Patients were assessed for myocardial ischemic injury by using clinical, biochemical, and electrocardiographic criteria. PMII was defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, new or worsened congestive heart failure, or new arrhythmias. Resource utilization parameters were compared for patients with and without PMII. Patients underwent the following index procedures: open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 44), bypass for aortoiliac disease (n = 29), bypass for femoropopliteal disease (n = 62), bypass for femorotibial disease (n = 71), extra-anatomic bypass (n = 23), and miscellaneous (n = 7). Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or only endovascular interventions were excluded. The incremental cost of PMII was estimated by applying the average costs (adjusted to 2004 US dollars) of the hospital ward (dollar 700.00/d) or intensive care unit (dollar 2500.00/d) to the length of stay differences for patients with and without PMII.\nThe overall mortality was 3.4% (8/236), and 7 of 8 deaths were related to PMII. PMII occurred in 42 (17.8%) of 236 patients: 22 myocardial infarctions, 11 congestive heart failures, and 12 new arrhythmias (3 patients had 2 PMII events). There was no evidence of differences in the incidence of PMII among the various index procedures. PMII was associated with a dramatic increase in resource utilization. The mean length of stay was 16.8 and 10.0 days for patients with and without PMII, respectively (P < .001). Intensive care unit care was required by 35 (83.3%) of 42 patients with and 121 (62.4%) of 194 patients without PMII (P < .009). The mean intensive care unit length of stay was 6.6 and 3.7 days for patients with and without PMII, respectively (P < .009). Ten (23.8%) of 42 patients with and 20 (10.3%) of 194 patients without PMII returned to the emergency department for care after discharge (P < .02).\nIn modern vascular surgery practice, PMII remains common despite the availability of beta-blockers and other preventative strategies. PMII is associated with dramatic increases in resource utilization and cost. The increase in resource utilization associated with PMII resulted in an estimated incremental cost per patient of dollar 9980.00. If 250,000 high-risk open vascular operations are performed annually in the United States, the economic burden of PMII in these procedures alone approximates dollar 444 million. Strategies to decrease PMII incidence and severity should be evaluated in large-scale prospective trials.",

The European guidelines were applied to quantify the number of high-risk patients.\nEighty-eight percent of 3950 patients were considered to be at high-risk. More than 80% had hyperlipidemia, approximately 50% had hypertension, 21% had diabetes mellitus, and 31% were current smokers. An asymptomatic reduced ankle-brachial index (< or = 0.90) was most frequently observed in patients with cerebrovascular disease (21%); an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (> or = 3.0 cm) in patients with PAD (5%) or cerebrovascular disease (5%); and an asymptomatic carotid stenosis (> or = 50%) in patients with PAD (15%). On the basis of noninvasive measurements, 73 (13%) of 545 patients initially considered as low risk were reclassified as high risk.\nThis study confirmed a high prevalence and clustering of modifiable atherosclerotic risk factors in high-risk patients. The yield of noninvasive vascular measurements was relatively low but identified a sizable number of high-risk patients. Standard screening for asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease identified a limited number of vascular abnormalities that necessitated immediate medical attention in patients already identified as high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Femoral pseudoaneurysm (FPA) is one of the common complications of percutaneous catheterization procedures performed via the femoral artery. The aim of this research was to evaluate factors associated with FPA of sufficient clinical significance that they required surgical treatment after diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization.\nWe evaluated 41,322 transfemoral catheterization procedures performed in our center within 7 years. Among all procedures, 630 FPAs developed that required surgical repair. Eighty-five cases were managed by compression with duplex guidance. As a case-control group, 1260 patients were selected from the patients who had been catheterized during the same time period but did not develop FPA. Two controls were selected for each study patient, matched according to age, sex, and catheterization day. Body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, catheter diameter, coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and number of cases performed per day in a particular room were evaluated as risk factors by using multivariate techniques.\nFemoral pseudoaneurysm required operative repair in 1.1% (n = 398) of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for diagnostic purposes and in 4.7% (n = 232) of patients after cardiac interventional procedures. Factors found to be independently predictive of FPA were hypertension (P = .011; odds ratio, 1.52), diabetes mellitus (P = .035; odds ratio, 1.11), coronary artery disease (P = .022; odds ratio, 1.21), larger (> or = 28 kg/m2) body mass index (P < .001; odds ratio, 2.21), larger number of cases (> or = 18) performed per day in a particular room (P < .001; odds ratio, 2.39), and larger (> or = 7F) catheter diameter (P < .001; odds ratio, 2.82).\nDue to the development of technology and experience, more and more diagnostic and interventional catheterization procedures are performed on a daily basis. In our study, a high volume of cases in a particular room and use of large catheters were important risk factors for FPA complications. When these situations are combined with other risk factors (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis), giving particular attention to local compression therapy would be more crucial to decrease the FPA rate.",

    "abstract": "To assess the long-term patency and clinical success of subintimal angioplasty in patients with limb-threatening ischemia.\nFrom 1999 through 2004, 29 patients with superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal artery occlusion and rest pain or tissue loss underwent subintimal angioplasty. Patients had subintimal wire placement followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement. From 1 to 10 stents were placed. Technical success required stenosis less than 30% by arteriography, a velocity ratio less than 1.5 by duplex scan, and improvement of the ankle-brachial index greater than 0.15. Follow-up duplex scanning was performed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.\nInitial success was obtained in 26 (90%) of the 29 patients, with an improvement in the mean ankle-brachial index of 0.25. Mean follow-up was 38 months (range, 28-54 months). During follow-up, 16 arteries reoccluded. Six of the 16 patients had recurrent symptoms, four required below-knee amputation, two required above-knee amputation, and four died with an intact limb. After treatment failure, two patients had attempted tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and four had prosthetic tibial bypass. Overall, 15 patients died, and only 2 of the 14 who lived had a patent artery. One of the two required percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the recanalized artery. By life-table analysis, success was 85%, 64%, 18%, and 9% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. Periprocedural complications occurred in four patients. Of the 13 patients with wounds, six died (four healed), two were alive with healed wounds, and five had limb loss. Of 16 patients with rest pain, 14 developed recurrent symptoms after reocclusion, 1 was alive without pain, and 1 underwent amputation.\nSubintimal angioplasty is technically successful in most patients, with few complications. Most procedures provide short-term clinical success and have allowed for successful wound healing and temporary relief of rest pain. However, late arterial patency is poor, with a high rate of symptom recurrence. Many patients will have recurrent pain, and some will require major amputation. Nevertheless, limb-salvage rates are significantly better than arterial patency. Intermediate-term patency is higher than that commonly reported for prosthetic bypass, and despite the lack of durable long-term patency, the procedure offers an additional potentially effective therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with limb-threatening ischemia and femoropopliteal occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Infrainguinal angioplasty provides a minimally invasive alternative to bypass surgery in patients with critical ischemia. This study aimed to determine the 2-year patency, limb salvage, and survival rates in patients who underwent infrainguinal angioplasty in a unit where angioplasty is used preferentially whenever possible for critical ischemia.\nA total of 333 consecutive patients who presented with rest pain, tissue loss, or both and who underwent an infrainguinal intervention in the 4-year period between January 1998 and January 2002 were divided into femoropopliteal and femorodistal groups. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus angiogram scoring system was used to classify the lesions. Angioplasty was the preferred procedure in all patients for whom a stump or portion of a superficial femoral artery was patent. Exclusion criteria included the concomitant or sequential treatment of iliac lesions. Patients were followed up after surgery with ankle-brachial indices and duplex ultrasonography.\nA total of 180 patients underwent 198 angioplasties. Primary cumulative patency, limb salvage, and survival for femoropopliteal angioplasty (n = 166) at 2 years were 75%, 90%, and 88%, respectively, and 60%, 76%, and 82% for infrapopliteal angioplasty (n = 32). At 30 days, mortality was 2.7%, and the complication rate was 8.3%. There was a restenosis rate (>50%) of 68% and 65% at 2 years for the femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal angioplasty groups, respectively. Seven patients required repeat angioplasty of the same site, 30 underwent subsequent bypass, and 16 of 43 occluded limbs were amputated. A total of 153 comparative control patients underwent 162 bypass procedures during the same period. Primary cumulative patency, limb salvage, and survival for femoropopliteal bypass (n = 80) at 2 years were 69%, 87%, and 76%, respectively, and were 53%, 57%, and 64% for infrapopliteal bypass (n = 82). The 30-day mortality for bypass was 5.2%, the complication rate was 35%, and 31 limbs were amputated.\nThe results of this study on the intermediate-term outcome of angioplasty suggest that angioplasty, when used preferentially for critical ischemia, in anatomically suitable patients provides very acceptable limb salvage and survival despite a relatively high restenosis rate.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have described the use of popliteal-to-distal bypass grafts, mostly in patients with diabetes mellitus who show tissue loss and represent a high-risk population. The study objective was to conduct meta-analysis to assess the long-term primary and secondary patency and foot preservation after popliteal-to-distal bypass grafts.\nData was retrieved from studies published from 1981 through 2004 that were identified from an electronic database. Thirty-one series that used survival analysis reported a 1-year graft patency rate and included at least 15 bypasses. Data from life tables, survival curves, and texts were used to calculate an interval success rate for each month in each series of grafts. Monthly success rates were combined across series to obtain a pooled estimate of success for each month, according to a random-effects protocol for meta-analysis. Pooled survival curves were then constructed for graft patency and foot preservation.\nThe 5-year pooled estimate +/- standard error was 63.1% +/- 4.3% for primary patency, 70.7% +/- 4.6% for secondary patency, and 77.7% +/- 4.3% for foot preservation. There was a superiority trend favoring reversed vein grafts and tibial bypasses that became more apparent in sensitivity analysis. No publication bias was detected.\nThe popliteal-to-distal vein bypass is a tool of high efficiency in the treatment of severe, chronic critical ischemia in the lower extremity.",

    "abstract": "Extracranial carotid artery aneurysm (CCA), although uncommon, represents a challenge to treatment strategy. The purpose of this study was to analyze the treatment evolution and clinical outcome of all patients with CCA over a two decade period.\nClinical data of all patients diagnosed with CCA who underwent interventions from 1984 to 2004 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I (1985-1994) and group II (1995-2004) were compared with regards to clinical presentation, treatment modality, and clinical outcome.\nA total of 42 cases of CCA were found during the study period (group I, n=22; group II, n=20). Pulsatile neck mass was the most common presenting symptom (n=39, 93%), followed by neurological symptoms (n=6, 14%). Twenty two (52%) were atherosclerotic aneurysms, fifteen (36%) false aneurysms, and five (12%) posttraumatic aneurysms. Both groups shared similar comorbidities and demographic profiles. All patients in group I underwent operative interventions, which included 12 resection with interposition bypass grafting (55%), six resection with patch angioplasty (27%), and four carotid ligation (18%). In group II, five patients underwent resection with interposition placement (25%) and one carotid ligation (5%). The remaining 14 patients underwent endovascular interventions (70%) which included seven stent-graft exclusions, six carotid stenting with coil exclusions, and one endovascular occlusion. Hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in group II than group I (3.5 vs. 9.4 days, p<0.01). The incidence of cranial nerve injury in group I and II were 14% vs. 5% (p<0.04), respectively. The 30-day mortality/major stroke rates in group I and II were 14% vs. 5% (p< 0.04), respectively. During the follow-up period (0.8 months-20 years; mean, 4.6 years), 16 patients died, largely due to cardiac etiologies (n=11, 69%).\nTreatment modality of CCA has largely evolved from operative to endovascular intervention at our institution. Treatment benefits of endovascular modality include shorter convalescent and less procedural-related complications. This evolution reflects the improvement of endovascular devices and increased utility of endovascular applications.",

    "abstract": "To define diameter at three levels along the popliteal artery and its relation to the inflow arteries in the normal state and in popliteal aneurysms.\nThe external diameter of the arteries was determined by duplex ultrasound scanning at the common femoral (CFA), superficial femoral artery (SFA), proximal popliteal artery (PPOP), mid-popliteal artery (MPOP), and distal popliteal artery (DPOP). Examinations were performed in 104 healthy men and 100 women. In addition, patients were screened for the presence of popliteal aneurysms (diameter >10 mm). Findings in healthy male subjects were compared with those with popliteal aneurysms.\nMean arterial diameters in normal men were larger than in women, but the SFA/CFA ratio was smaller in women (0.74 +/- 0.08 vs 0.78 +/- 0.09; P < .001) and the MPOP/SFA ratio was larger (0.98 +/- 0.11 vs 0.94 +/- 0.12; P = .001). In both genders, normal popliteal artery diameter was not uniform throughout its length, with PPOP and MPOP being nearly identical, and DPOP was smaller. MPOP diameter correlated most closely with SFA diameter (r = 0.51; P < .001) and less with height, weight and body surface area (r = 0.2 to 0.3) and was not associated with age or the presence of hypertension. In 27 men with 45 patent, fusiform popliteal aneurysms (10 to 44 mm) the site of maximal dilatation was in the region of the MPOP in 39 cases and near the PPOP in only 6 cases. The DPOP was never the largest segment and only in one case was it >10 mm. Arterial diameter in aneurysm patients was larger than normal at all levels but was greatest near the MPOP level (15.7 +/- 6.9). Popliteal-to-SFA diameter ratios were increased in the aneurysm group at all three levels but were greatest at the MPOP level (1.85 vs 0.94, P < .001). Comparing 15 popliteal aneurysms >20 mm with smaller ones, distal popliteal artery changed to the least extent but did increase in diameter (6.1 +/- 1.2 vs 7.0 +/- 1.4, P < .04). In larger aneurysms the MPOP/SFA ratio increased from 1.54 to 2.5 (P < .001).\nThe diameter of the normal popliteal artery is not uniform throughout its length. In popliteal aneurysms, the region of the MPOP is most commonly the largest diameter. The MPOP/SFA ratio is greater than normal in popliteal aneurysms and increases in larger aneurysms. DPOP does dilate but to a lesser extent then PPOP and MPOP, making endovascular repair anatomically feasible in most popliteal aneurysms.",

    "results": "Mean arterial diameters in normal men were larger than in women, but the SFA/CFA ratio was smaller in women (0.74 +/- 0.08 vs 0.78 +/- 0.09; P < .001) and the MPOP/SFA ratio was larger (0.98 +/- 0.11 vs 0.94 +/- 0.12; P = .001). In both genders, normal popliteal artery diameter was not uniform throughout its length, with PPOP and MPOP being nearly identical, and DPOP was smaller. MPOP diameter correlated most closely with SFA diameter (r = 0.51; P < .001) and less with height, weight and body surface area (r = 0.2 to 0.3) and was not associated with age or the presence of hypertension. In 27 men with 45 patent, fusiform popliteal aneurysms (10 to 44 mm) the site of maximal dilatation was in the region of the MPOP in 39 cases and near the PPOP in only 6 cases. The DPOP was never the largest segment and only in one case was it >10 mm. Arterial diameter in aneurysm patients was larger than normal at all levels but was greatest near the MPOP level (15.7 +/- 6.9). Popliteal-to-SFA diameter ratios were increased in the aneurysm group at all three levels but were greatest at the MPOP level (1.85 vs 0.94, P < .001). Comparing 15 popliteal aneurysms >20 mm with smaller ones, distal popliteal artery changed to the least extent but did increase in diameter (6.1 +/- 1.2 vs 7.0 +/- 1.4, P < .04). In larger aneurysms the MPOP/SFA ratio increased from 1.54 to 2.5 (P < .001).",

    "abstract": "Popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) is uncommon. The clinical presentation of PAA includes rupture, embolism, and thrombosis. In this article, we evaluate the results of our 20-year experience with surgical management of PAAs, analyzing the role of anatomic, clinical, and surgical factors that potentially affect early and long-term results.\nFrom January 1984 to December 2004, 159 PAAs in 137 patients were operated on at our department. Data from all the patients were retrospectively collected in a database. PAAs were asymptomatic in 67 cases (42%); 5 (3%) PAAs were ruptured. In 51 cases (32%), PAA caused intermittent claudication. The remaining 36 limbs (23%) had threatening ischemia due in 30 cases to acute PAA thrombosis, in 4 cases to chronic PAA thrombosis, and in 2 cases to distal embolization. In selected patients with acute ischemia, preoperative intra-arterial thrombolysis with urokinase was performed. Early results in terms of mortality, graft thrombosis, and limb salvage were assessed. Follow-up consisted of clinical and ultrasonographic examinations at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Long-term survival, patency, and limb salvage rates were analyzed.\nForty cases were treated with aneurysmectomy and prosthetic graft interposition; in 39 cases, the aneurysm was opened, and a graft was placed inside the aneurysm. Four patients had aneurysmectomy with end-to-end anastomosis. In 73 cases, ligation of the aneurysm with bypass grafting (39 with a prosthetic graft and 34 with an autologous vein) was performed. The remaining three patients underwent endovascular exclusion of their PAAs. A medial approach was used in 97 patients (61%), and a posterior approach was used in 59 patients (37.1%). The outflow vessel was in most cases (93.7%) the below-knee popliteal artery. Thirty-day amputation and death rates were 4.4% (7/159 limbs) and 2.1% (3/137 patients), respectively. The amputation rate was significantly higher in symptomatic limbs than in asymptomatic ones (6.5% and 1.4%, respectively; P = .05). Eight limbs (5%) had an early graft thrombosis that required a reintervention. Follow-up was available in 116 patients (84.7%) and 138 limbs (86%) with a mean follow-up time of 40 months (range, 1-205 months). The cumulative estimated 60-month survival, limb salvage, and primary and secondary patency rates were 84.2%, 86.7%, 66.3%, and 83.6%, respectively. Asymptomatic limbs had significantly better results than symptomatic ones in terms of limb salvage (93.4% and 80.4%, respectively; P = .03; log-rank, 4.2) and primary patency (86.5% and 51.6%, respectively; P = .001; log-rank, 10.3). Among symptomatic patients, results were better in claudicant limbs than in acutely ischemic ones in terms of limb salvage (90.5% and 58.7%, respectively; P = .001; log-rank, 17.5). Univariate analysis showed the absence of symptoms, the presence of two or three tibial vessels, the use of a posterior approach, the kind of intervention, and the site of distal anastomosis to significantly affect long-term patency. Cox regression for factors affecting 60-month primary patency showed that clinical presentation, runoff status, and the site of distal anastomosis significantly influenced long-term results.\nResults of surgery on asymptomatic PAAs are good-significantly better than those for symptomatic ones. Elective surgical intervention should be performed in patients with a low surgical risk and a long life expectancy when the correct indication exists. In thrombosed aneurysms, intra-arterial thrombolysis may represent an alternative to emergent surgical management. Our data demonstrated that results are similarly good in claudicants, and this fact confirms that only acute ischemia due to PAA thrombosis represents a real surgical challenge. In selected patients with focal lesions, a posterior approach seems to offer better long-term results. The runoff status and the site of distal anastomosis affect long-term patency as well.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms often coexist with reduced lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These conditions are each associated with cigarette smoking, cardiovascular disease, and evidence of increased inflammatory and hemostatic activity. The aim of this study was to determine if these factors accounted for the link between aneurysms and pulmonary disease.\nThe design was a case-control study comparing patients with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm with population-based controls without an aneurysm. Aneurysms were diagnosed by ultrasound scan, and pulmonary function was measured by respiratory questionnaire and spirometry. Activation of inflammation and hemostasis was measured by assay of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, fibrin D-dimer, and plasmin antiplasmin complexes.\nCases with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 89) had more COPD and worse expiratory lung function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) than controls (n = 98) (FEV1, 1.9 vs 2.2 L, P < .01; FEV1/FVC, 0.67 vs 0.75, P < .001) and did not differ in restrictive function (FVC, 2.9 vs 3.0 L, P = .33). Cases also had higher levels of lifetime cigarette smoking (30 vs 24 pack-years, P < 0.01), cardiovascular disease (35% vs 18%, P = .01), plasma fibrinogen (3.5 vs 3.1 g/L, P = .02), IL-6 (2.8 vs 1.8, pg/mL, P < .001), plasmin antiplasmin complexes (596 vs 384 microg/L, P = .01), and D-dimer (442 vs 93 ng/mL, P < .001). On multiple logistic regression analysis of lung function and COPD on the risk of aneurysm, both cigarette smoking and cardiovascular disease had little effect on the relationships. For the markers of activated inflammation and hemostasis, plasmin antiplasmin complexes and D-dimer had the most important confounding effect on the odds ratios. All markers combined had a substantial effect: odds ratio of aneurysm for a one standard deviation decrease in FEV1 fell from 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 3.5) (P < .01) to 1.3 (95% CI, 0.55 to 2.4) (P > or = .05).\nThe association between reduced respiratory function and abdominal aortic aneurysm was not accounted for by cigarette smoking or cardiovascular disease. We hypothesize that activation of inflammation and hemostasis in response to injury may be an important explanation of the association between aneurysm formation and reduced respiratory function. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis.",

The study cohort consisted of 1205 elective and 546 emergency AAA patients. Four independent physiologic variables-age, acute physiology score, emergency operation, and chronic health evaluation-were used to develop multiple regression and ANN models to predict in-hospital mortality. The models were developed on 75% of the patient population and their validity tested on the remaining 25%. The results from these two models were compared with the observed outcome and clinicians' estimates by using measures of calibration, discrimination, and subgroup analysis.\nObserved in-hospital mortality for elective surgery was 9.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.7% to 11.1%) and for emergency surgery, 46.7% (95% CI, 42.5 to 51.0%). The ANN and the statistical models were both more accurate than the clinicians' predictions. Only the statistical model was internally valid, however, when applied to the validation set of observations, as evidenced by calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow C statistic, 14.97; P = .060), discrimination properties (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.869; 95% CI, 0.824 to 0.913), and subgroup analysis.\nThe prediction of in-hospital mortality in AAA patients by multiple regression is more accurate than clinicians' estimates or ANN modelling.

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an increasingly used alternative to open surgical repair of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The effect of EVAR on postprocedure acute renal failure has not been determined. We hypothesized that EVAR would be associated with a lower risk of acute renal failure and acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted of the 2002 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, reflecting discharges from a representative sample of United States hospitals. We identified 6614 discharges with a primary diagnosis of unruptured AAA and a primary procedure code for open AAA repair or EVAR. We excluded 56 patients with end-stage renal disease and 42 patients who underwent concomitant aortorenal bypass. We compared EVAR vs open repair in this cohort. The main outcome measures were acute renal failure and acute renal failure requiring dialysis.\nA total of 6516 patient discharges met the inclusion criteria for the study, and postprocedure acute renal failure developed in 439 (6.7%). EVAR was associated with lower odds of acute renal failure (adjusted odds ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.53) and acute renal failure requiring dialysis (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30, 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.63). Results were similar when EVAR and open AAA repair were compared within quintiles of the propensity score for the receipt of EVAR.\nCompared with open AAA repair, EVAR is associated with a lower risk of postprocedure acute renal failure.",

    "abstract": "The successful application of endovascular techniques for the elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has stimulated a strong interest in their possible use in dealing with a long-standing surgical challenge: the ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA). The use of a conventional open procedure to repair ruptured aneurysms is associated with a high operative mortality of 45% to 50%. In this study, we evaluated the current frequency of endovascular repair of RAAAs in four large states and the impact of this technique on patient outcome.\nWe examined discharge data sets from 2000 through 2003 from the four states of California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York, whose combined population represents almost a third of the United States population. Proportions and trends were analyzed by chi2 analysis and continuous variables by the Student's t test.\nWe found that since the year 2000, endovascular repair has begun to emerge as a viable treatment option for RAAAs, accounting for the repair of 6.2% of cases in 2003. During the same period, the use of open procedures for RAAAs declined. The overall mortality rate for the 4-year period was significantly lower for endovascular vs open repair (39.3% vs. 47.7%, P = .005). Moreover, compared with open repair, endovascular repair resulted in a significantly lower rate of pulmonary, renal, and bleeding complications. Survival after endovascular repair correlated with hospital experience, as assessed by the overall volume of elective and nonelective endovascular procedures. For endovascular repairs, mortality ranged from 45.9% for small volume hospitals to 26% for large volume hospitals (P = .0011). Volume was also a determinant of mortality for open repairs, albeit to a much lesser extent (51.5% for small volume hospitals, 44.3% for large volume hospitals; P < .0001).\nWe observed a benefit to using endovascular procedures for RAAAs in institutions with significant endovascular experience; however, the analysis of administrative data cannot rule out selection bias as an explanation of better outcomes. These data strongly endorse the need for prospective studies to clarify to what extent the improved survival in RAAA patients is to be attributed to the endovascular approach rather than the selection of low-risk patients.",

We examined a national Medicare database to establish the effect of EVAR introduction into the United States.\nA 5% random sample of inpatient Medicare claims from 2000 to 2003 was queried using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis and procedure codes. An EVAR procedure code was available after October 2000. Occurrences were multiplied by 20 to estimate yearly national volumes and then divided into the yearly Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) population of elderly Medicare recipients for rates per capita, reported as cases per 100,000 elderly Medicare recipients. Statistical analysis was performed by using chi2, Student's t test, nonparametric tests, and multiple regression analysis, with significance defined as P < or = .05.\nElective AAA repairs averaged 87.7 per 100,000 Medicare patients between 2000 and 2003, with EVAR has steadily increasing to 41% of elective repairs in 2003. From 2000 to 2003, overall elective AAA mortality declined from 5.0% to 3.7% (P < .001), while open repair mortality remained unchanged. EVAR patients are significantly older than patients treated with open repair. From 2000 to 2003 patients >84 years receiving EVAR increased to 62.7% (P < .001). Overall hospital length of stay (LOS) decreased from 8.6 days in 2000 to 7.3 days in 2003, P < .001, but increased for open AAA patients.

Average elective repair hospital charges were not different between groups, but Medicare reimbursement was lower for EVAR, with a higher proportion cases classified as DRG 111 (major cardiovascular procedure without complications). EVAR was used in 10.6% of ruptured AAA repairs in 2003, with a significant reduction in mortality compared with open repairs for rupture (31.8% vs 50.8%; P < .001).\nEVAR is replacing open surgery without an increase in overall case volume. EVAR is responsible for overall decrease in operative mortality even in ruptured aneurysms while decreasing utilization variables. Reimbursement to hospitals is shrinking, however.",

Criteria for repair were a diameter of > or = 30 mm for anastomotic aneurysms and > or = 35 mm for true aneurysms. Preferentially, tubular grafts were used. Follow-up included both radiographs of the abdomen and duplex examination.\nIn 35 patients, 40 IAAs were treated endovascularly with a tubular stent-graft. Elective repair was performed in 30 patients (86%) and emergent repair in five patients (14%). Aneurysms were false in 26 cases (65%) and true in 14 cases (35%). Local anesthesia was used in 74% of the cases. The stent-grafts that were used included the Excluder contralateral limb (n = 28, 70%), Passager (n = 9, 22.5%), Hemobahn (n = 2, 5%), and Wallgraft (n = 1, 2.5%). The mean operation time was 83 +/- 28 minutes (range, 50 to 150 minutes). Mean hospital stay was 3.3 +/- 2.3 days (range, 1 to 12 days). There was no 30-day mortality.

Complications occurred in two patients during follow-up, including migration with a proximal type I endoleak in one, and occlusion of the stent-graft in the other. The internal iliac artery was intentionally sacrificed in 28 patients (70%), and this led to gluteal claudication in three patients.\nEndovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysms with flexible stent-grafts is a minimally invasive technique and is associated with low mortality and morbidity.

    "abstract": "A rapidly increasing number of thoracic aortic lesions are now treated by endoluminal exclusion by using stent grafts. Many of these lesions abut the great vessels and limit the length of the proximal landing zone. Various methods have been used to address this issue. We report our experience with subclavian artery revascularization in association with endoluminal repair of acute and chronic thoracic aortic pathology.\nThirty (43%) of 70 patients undergoing thoracic endovascular stent-graft placement from January 2001 to August 2005 had lesions adjacent to or involving the origin of the subclavian artery. The mean age was 62 years (range, 22-85 years; 63% were men, and 37% were women). This subgroup of 30 patients had indications for repair that included thoracic aortic aneurysm (n = 15), traumatic transection (n = 6), chronic dissection with pseudoaneurysm (n = 5), and acute dissection with intramural hematoma (n = 4). All 30 patients had the subclavian origin covered by the stent graft. In eight cases (27%), no effort was made to revascularize the subclavian artery before or during the endograft placement procedure. Twenty-three (77%) of 30 patients underwent subclavian to carotid artery transposition (n = 21) or bypass (n = 2) before (n = 12; average of 14 days before stent-graft placement), concomitant with (n = 10), or after (n = 1) the endovascular procedure. Physical examination and computed tomography scans were performed after surgery at 1, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter. The mean follow-up was 18 months (range, 1-51 months).\nFive acute complications occurred in the eight patients (63%) who had the subclavian artery covered without pre-endograft revascularization and included four patients who experienced stroke (accounting for the only death) and one patient who developed symptomatic subclavian-vertebral steal that necessitated transposition 7 months later. Two (9%) of the 23 patients who had subclavian revascularization experienced left-sided vocal cord palsies, and 1 patient (4%) developed lower extremity paraparesis secondary to spinal cord ischemia. No late endoleaks related to retrograde sac perfusion from the most distal great vessel have been identified in any patient.\nSubclavian revascularization procedures can be performed with relatively low risk. Complications are rare, and patient recovery is rapid. Although this is not necessary in all cases, we advocate subclavian to carotid transposition when the aortic lesion is within 15 mm of the left subclavian orifice to prevent type II endoleak or perfusion of a dissected false lumen when the ipsilateral vertebral artery is patent and dominant or when coronary revascularization using an ipsilateral internal mammary artery is anticipated and in cases that necessitate extensive coverage of intercostals that contribute to spinal cord perfusion. Carotid to subclavian artery bypass should be reserved for patients with a patent internal mammary artery conduit perfusing a coronary vessel and should be combined with proximal subclavian ligation.",

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive endovascular treatment of a traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta is a new strategy in the care of multitrauma patients. We report the experience in The Netherlands with endovascular management of patients with acute traumatic ruptures of the thoracic aorta.\nWe reviewed 28 patients with a traumatic thoracic aortic rupture treated with a thoracic aortic endograft between June 2000 and April 2004. All patients underwent treatment at one of the four participating level 1 trauma centers. Data collected included age, sex, injury severity score, type of endovascular graft, endovascular operation time, length of stay, length of stay in the intensive care unit, and mortality. Follow-up data consisted of computed tomographic angiography and plain chest radiographs at regular intervals.\nAll patients (mean age, 40.9 years; SD, 18.5 years) experienced severe traumatic injury, and the mean injury severity score was 37.1 (SD, 7.8). All endovascular procedures were technically successful, and the median operating time for the endovascular procedure was 58 minutes (interquartile range, 47-88 minutes). The overall hospital mortality was 14.3% (n = 4), and all deaths were unrelated to the aortic rupture or stent placement. There was no intervention-related mortality during a median follow-up of 26.5 months (interquartile range, 10-34.6 months). Postoperative data showed no severe endovascular graft- or procedure-related morbidity, except for one patient with an asymptomatic collapse of the endovascular graft during regular follow-up. This was corrected by placing a second graft.\nThis study shows that the results of immediate endovascular repair of a traumatic aortic rupture are at least equal to those of conventional open surgical repair. Especially in these multitrauma patients with traumatic ruptures of the thoracic aorta, endovascular therapy seems to be preferable to conventional open surgical repair.",

The overall hospital mortality was 14.3% (n = 4), and all deaths were unrelated to the aortic rupture or stent placement. There was no intervention-related mortality during a median follow-up of 26.5 months (interquartile range, 10-34.6 months). Postoperative data showed no severe endovascular graft- or procedure-related morbidity, except for one patient with an asymptomatic collapse of the endovascular graft during regular follow-up. This was corrected by placing a second graft.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine the outcome in the United States after endovascular repair (EVAR) of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in patients at high-risk for open surgery by using independently audited, high-compliance, chart-verified data sets, and to compare those results with open surgery.\nHigh-risk was defined to match a recent European trial (EVAR2) and included age of > or =60 years with aneurysm size of > or =5.5 cm, plus at least one cardiac, pulmonary, or renal comorbidity. Data from five multicenter investigational device exemption clinical trials leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval were analyzed. Of 2216 EVAR patients, 565 met the high-risk criteria. Of 342 surgical controls (OPEN), 61 met high-risk criteria. Primary outcome comparisons included AAA-related death, all-cause death, and aneurysm rupture. Secondary measures were endoleak, AAA sac enlargement, and migration.\nAverage age of the high-risk EVAR subset was 76 +/- 7 years vs 74 +/- 6 years OPEN (P = 0.07), mean EVAR AAA size was 6.4 +/- 0.8 cm vs 6.6 +/- 1.0 cm OPEN (P = .33), and average EVAR follow-up was 2.7 years vs 2.5 years OPEN. The 30-day operative mortality was 2.9% in EVAR vs 5.1% in OPEN (P = .32). The AAA-related death rate after EVAR was 3.0% at 1 year and 4.2% at 4 years compared with 5.1% at both time points after OPEN (P = .58). Overall survival at 4 years after EVAR was 56% vs 66% in OPEN (P = .23). After treatment, EVAR successfully prevented rupture in 99.5% at 1 year and in 97.2% at 4 years.\nEndovascular repair of large infrarenal AAAs in anatomically suited high-surgical-risk patients using FDA-approved devices in the United States is safe and provides lasting protection from AAA-related mortality. EVAR mortality remained comparable with OPEN up to 4 years. The decision to treat AAAs in patients with advanced age and significant comorbidities must be individualized and carefully considered, but repair provides excellent protection from AAA-related death.",

    "abstract": "Clinical dextrans, such as Dextran 40 and Dextran 70, are associated with anaphylactoid reactions caused by dextran-reactive immunoglobulin G antibodies. When infused immediately before clinical dextrans, dextran 1 significantly reduces the incidence of severe anaphylactoid reactions. The objective of the study was to describe the frequency and characteristics of reports submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid events after clinical dextran administration.\nWe searched the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System for reports associated with a clinical dextran and describing anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions. Our case definition for a probable anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid event required signs or symptoms from at least two body systems, with at least one sign or symptom being hypotension, vasodilation, or respiratory difficulty, and onset within 60 minutes. Other reports were considered possible cases if the reporter specifically described the reaction as anaphylaxis or an anaphylactoid reaction. Premier RxMarket Advisor provided estimates of total US hospitalizations with clinical dextran or dextran 1 administration from 2000 to 2004, based on discharge billing data from a sample of US hospitals. The IMS National Sales Perspective provided estimates of total doses of dextrans sold in the United States from 1999 to 2004, based on volumes of dextrans sold in a sample of retail and nonretail outlets.\nThe FDA received 366 clinical dextran adverse event reports from 1969 to 2004, of which 90 (24.6%) were anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid events. The ratio of hospitalizations where clinical dextran was administered to hospitalizations where dextran 1 was administered was 28.4:1. The expected ratio would be 1:1 if all clinical dextran patients had received dextran 1 pretreatment. The ratio of clinical dextran doses sold to dextran 1 doses sold in the United States was 38.6:1.\nA high proportion of adverse event reports for clinical dextrans described anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions. Hospital discharge and product sales data suggest that dextran 1 has not been used consistently before clinical dextran administration in recent years. To reduce the risk of anaphylactoid reactions, physicians should consider routine administration of dextran 1 before the infusion of a clinical dextran.",

    "abstract": "The role of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) in the treatment of asymptomatic patients with carotid disease remains controversial. The purpose of this report is to compare outcomes in asymptomatic patients treated with CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This was the initial experience performing CAS for most of the surgeons. For comparison, we also report our outcomes in standard-risk patients treated concurrently with CEA during the same period of time.\nA retrospective, nonrandomized review of asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA or CAS at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis was done. Patients with >70% asymptomatic carotid stenosis treated between September 2003 and April 2005 were identified. CEA was the first therapeutic consideration in all patients. CAS was reserved for high-risk patients. Thirty-day outcomes of stroke or death were recorded. During this time interval, 248 patients were treated including with 93 CAS and with 145 CEA. Symptomatic or clinically detected adverse outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, renal failure, or pulmonary complications were noted but were not the primary end points of this review. This study addresses only the periprocedural outcomes of CEA and CAS in asymptomatic patients. No data >30-day follow-up are included.\nDuring this period, 93 CAS and 145 CEA procedures were done in asymptomatic patients. Patient characteristics in both groups were similar. Carotid protection devices were used in 91.4% of CAS patients. The results in the CAS group showed one death (1.1%) and one stroke (1.1%). In the CEA group, three strokes occurred (2.1%, P = 0.9999), one associated with death (0.7%, P = 0.9999). The CAS group had 1.34 +/- 0.83 risk factors vs 0.39 +/- 0.58 in the CEA group (P < .0001). Median CAS and CEA length of stay was 1 day.\nCAS for asymptomatic carotid stenosis demonstrated equivalent outcomes compared with CEA, despite CAS being reserved for use in a disadvantaged subset of high-risk patients owing to anatomic risk factors or medical comorbidities. These results suggest CAS should be considered a reasonable treatment option in the high-risk but asymptomatic patient. Enthusiasm for CAS should be tempered by the recognition that long-term outcomes in CAS-treated asymptomatic patients remain unknown.",

    "abstract": "Interruption of antegrade cerebral perfusion results in transient neurologic intolerance in some patients undergoing carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study sought to evaluate factors that contributed to the development of cerebral ischemia during PercuSurge balloon occlusion and techniques used to allow successful completion of the CAS procedure.\nThe PercuSurge occlusion balloon was used in 43 of 165 patients treated with CAS for high-grade stenosis (mean stenosis, 90%). All 43 patients were at increased risk for endarterectomy (7 restenosis, 3 irradiation, 3 contralateral occlusion, and 30 Goldman class II-III); 20% were symptomatic. Symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion during temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery occurred in 10 of 43 and included dysarthria (7/10), agitation (6/10), decreased level of consciousness (5/10), and focal hemispheric deficit (3/10). An incomplete circle of Willis or contralateral carotid artery occlusion, or both, was present in 8 of 10 patients. Symptoms resulting from PercuSurge balloon occlusion were managed by balloon deflation with or without evacuation of blood from the internal carotid artery using the Export catheter. All symptoms resolved completely without deficit after deflation of the occlusion balloon.\nThe development of neurologic symptoms after initial PercuSurge balloon inflation and occluded internal carotid artery flow was associated with a decrease in the mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) from 15 to 10 (range, 9 to 14); the GCS returned to normal after occlusion balloon deflation and remained normal during subsequent reinflation. The mean time to spontaneous recovery of full neurologic function was 8 minutes (range, 4 to 15 minutes). No thrombotic or embolic events were present on cerebral angiography or computed tomography scan. Balloon reinflation was performed after a mean reperfusion interval of 10 minutes after full neurologic recovery (range, 4 to 20 minutes). The mean subsequent procedure duration was 11.9 minutes (range, 6 to 21 minutes). No recurrence of neurologic symptoms occurred when the occlusion balloon was reinflated. All 10 patients underwent successful CAS without occlusion, dissection, cerebrovascular accident, or death.\nSeveral factors may contribute to the development of neurologic intolerance during CAS with balloon occlusion. Elucidation of the protective cellular mechanisms that invoke ischemic tolerance after the initial transient ischemic event may enable CAS with embolic protection in patients who cannot tolerate initial interruption of antegrade cerebral perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Complete removal of an aortic endograft with suprarenal fixation is difficult. We report the use of a simple device to extract a Zenith endograft. This device is made by cutting off the tip of the cylinder of a 20-mL syringe and rounding off the edges. The main body of the graft is resheathed by advancing the cylinder cranially while keeping the graft in a stable position. This way, the graft collapses and the hooks are withdrawn without tearing the wall of the aorta. The supraceliac clamping time in our patient was less than 2 minutes. This technique offers a safe and fast solution to the potentially hazardous removal of an aortic endograft with suprarenal fixation.",

We describe an alternative technique that involves the slow pulling of the deployment knob. The key features of this technique include anticipating the asymmetric flowering of the graft that occurs toward the contralateral limb, prompt correction of any graft malpositioning, and maintaining the slow deployment until the contralateral gate is released. Our experience with this technique demonstrates that it is accurate, safe, and reduces the need for proximal extension cuffs.",

Herein we report two cases of traumatic ACF: one asymptomatic and the other presenting with congestive heart failure (CHF) 20 and 30 years, respectively, after their initial injury. The recent onset of CHF, the presence of a continuous abdominal bruit, and, in the second patient, a history of penetrating trauma suggested the diagnosis of ACF. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography scanning in both patients. Surgical repair of the ACF in the symptomatic patient resulted in resolution of the CHF and reversed the dilatation of the aorta and inferior vena cava. The asymptomatic patient was lost to follow-up. CHF in a young male patient with a history of penetrating abdominal trauma should alert the surgeon to this rare complication.",

Three groups were studied: sham-operated rats (n = 10), control rats with endarterectomy (n = 10) or rats with endarterectomy treated with the PARP inhibitor, INO-1001 (5 mg/kg daily) postoperatively (n =10). After 21 days, neointima formation and vascular remodeling were assessed.\nImmunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated activation of the peroxynitrite-PARP pathway with significant staining for nitrotyrosine, poly(ADP-ribose), and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the neointima of the control group. Treatment with INO-1001 significantly reduced the neointima area (0.024 mm2 +/- 0.019 mm2 vs 0.089 mm2 +/- 0.033 mm2 in the control group), the neointima/media thickness ratio (0.81 +/- 0.05 vs 2.76 +/- 1.57 in the control group), and the inflammation score (0.1 +/- 0.07 vs 0.3 +/- 0.12 in the control group) after endarterectomy.\nPharmacologic inhibition of PARP with INO-1001 may be a new concept to prevent neointimal hyperplasia after endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "CD39 (nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase [NTPDase-1]) expressed on the luminal surface of endothelial cells rapidly metabolizes extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and abrogates platelet reactivity. Optimization of CD39 enzymatic activity appears dependent upon the expression of both transmembrane domains within plasma membranes. Thus, motivation exists to examine therapeutic antiplatelet formulations that consist of liposomal CD39.\nFull-length human CD39 was produced by using a yeast expression system, purified, and reconstituted within lipid vesicles. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of CD39-mediated phosphohydrolysis of ADP and ATP was determined both for detergent-solubilized and protein-reconstituted CD39 within lipid membranes. The capacity of CD39-containing lipid vesicles to inhibit platelet activation induced by ADP, collagen, or thrombin was determined in vitro by platelet aggregometry. A murine model of thromboplastin-induced thromboembolism was used to determine the effectiveness of intravenous liposomal CD39 in limiting platelet consumption and mortality.\nReconstitution of human CD39 in lipid vesicles was associated with a decrease in Km of nearly an order of magnitude over the detergent-solubilized form. There was a concomitant increase in both ADPase and ATPase catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km ADPase: sol CD39: 2.7 x 10(6) vs liposomal CD39: 1.4 x 10(7) min/ M; kcat/Km ATPase: sol CD39: 7.2 x 10(6) vs liposomal CD39: 2.0 x10(7) min/M). Furthermore, CD39 lipid vesicles effectively inhibited platelet aggregation when activated by ADP, collagen, or thrombin, and also promoted platelet disaggregation (60.4% +/- 6.1%). Treatment with CD39 lipid vesicles preserved platelet counts after thromboplastin injection (pretreatment, 906.8 +/- 42.9 platelets/microm3; empty vesicles, 278.6 +/- 34.8 platelets/microm3; CD39 vesicles, 563.6 +/- 42.2 platelets/microm3; n = 10 mice/test group; P < .0001). In parallel survival studies, liposomal CD39 reduced mortality from 73% to 33% (P < or = .05; n = 12 mice/experimental test group, n = 15 mice/control test group).\nIncorporation of solubilized CD39 into a lipid bilayer restores enzyme activity and optimizes thromboregulatory potential. Treatment with CD39 in liposomal formulations decreased mortality in a murine model of thromboplastin-induced thromboembolism by limiting intravascular platelet aggregation and thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess whether the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone can inhibit vein graft thickening without the occurrence of serious side effects.\nVenous interposition grafting was performed in the common carotid artery of hypercholesterolemic ApoE3Leiden transgenic mice. Mice were treated with dexamethasone (0.15 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) orally), and after 28 days, vein graft thickening was quantified.\nTreatment with dexamethasone resulted in a significant 43% reduction in lesion area without changes in lesion composition when compared with nontreated controls. However, dexamethasone, when administered for a prolonged period of time, is known for its potentially serious side effects. To overcome these potential side effects of prolonged dexamethasone treatment, the effect of a short-term 7-day dexamethasone treatment was studied. This short dexamethasone treatment resulted in a 49% decrease of vein graft thickening at 28 days. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment led to reduced local expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and factors in the vein grafts 24 hours after surgery. Finally, observations in mice were verified in human saphenous organ cultures. Exposure to dexamethasone for either 7 or 28 days significantly reduced intimal hyperplasia formation on cultured saphenous vein segments.\nShort-term anti-inflammatory treatment with dexamethasone leads to a significant reduction in vein graft thickening over an extended period, possibly by the reduction of early expression of proinflammatory cytokines. This 7-day treatment minimizes the risk of unwanted side effects of long-term dexamethasone treatment and may be a new approach to prevent graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that is associated with the long-term sequelae of chronic pulmonary hypertension. Prior experimental work has suggested that post-PE inflammation is accompanied by pulmonary artery intimal hyperplasia. This study evaluated the effect of the thrombus and tested the hypothesis that thrombolytic, antiplatelet, and anticoagulant agents would decrease pulmonary injury.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 267) underwent laparotomy and temporary clip occlusion of the infrarenal inferior vena cava for the formation of endogenous thrombus or placement of an inert silicone \"thrombus.\" Two days later, repeat laparotomy was performed, the clip removed, and the thrombus or silicone plug was embolized to the lungs. The endogenous thrombus group received normal saline, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or a gIIB/IIIA antagonist (abciximab). Lung tissue was harvested at various times over 21 days and assayed for total collagen, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-13 (IL-13), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Fixed sections were stained with trichrome for intimal hyperplasia determination and ED-1 monocytes and alpha-actin-positive staining.\nThe overall survival for rats undergoing PE was 90%, was not affected by treatment, and 84% of all PE localized to the right pulmonary artery. The PE significantly reduced Pa(O2) in all groups. Compared with controls, the silicone emboli group had an increased level of IL-13 on day 1, an increased level of MCP-1 on day 4, and an increase in the levels of all inflammatory mediators on day 14 (P < .05). Accompanying these differences were greater pulmonary artery intimal hyperplasia at days 4 and 21 in the silicone group compared with controls (P < .05). LMWH treatment in the thrombus of PE rats significantly decreased IL-13 levels at all time points, whereas treatment with abciximab or tPA significantly increased IL-13 levels compared with controls. TGF-beta levels were significantly increased by LMWH at day 4 and 14, and abciximab was associated with lower TGF-beta at day 14. Only LMWH was associated with less pulmonary artery intimal hyperplasia at day 14 compared with controls and the other treatment groups.\nPersistent pulmonary artery distention by an inert material is sufficient to invoke significant inflammation and intimal hyperplasia independent of the thrombus itself. Compared with nontreated PE, LMWH is the only therapy associated with a significant reduction in late intimal hyperplasia and, with the exception of TGF-beta, lower profibrotic growth-factor production.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new neovalve construction technique in postthrombotic syndrome. The surgical procedure is described, and preliminary results of the first case series are given.\nFrom December 2000 to June 2004, neovalve construction in 18 limbs was performed on 16 patients (8 male and 8 female; median age, 55.5 years; range, 34-79 years) to treat severe chronic venous insufficiency in cases of postthrombotic syndrome. Surgical treatment was recommended in cases of nonhealing or recurrent ulcers (CEAP classification class C6). Preoperative duplex scanning, ascending/descending venography, and air plethysmography were routinely performed. Valvular cusps were created by dissecting the thickened venous wall to obtain material with which to fashion a new monocuspid or bicuspid valve. Mean follow-up was 22 months (range, 1-42 months). Postoperative duplex scanning and air plethysmography were performed in all patients. Descending venography was performed after surgery in 15 limbs.\nIn 16 lower extremities (89%), the ulcer healed within 4 to 25 weeks (median, 12 weeks), and no recurrences occurred. Neovalve competence was confirmed in 17 cases (95%). Postoperative duplex scan and air plethysmography showed a significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters (P < .001), especially in younger patients with good muscle pump function. In 17 limbs (95%), the treated segments remained primarily patent at median follow-up of 22 months. Early thrombosis below the neovalve site occurred in two patients (12%). No perioperative pulmonary embolism was observed. A late occlusion occurred in one patient (6%), 8 months after surgery. Minor postoperative complications occurred in three patients (17%).\nNeovalve construction seems to be effective in restoring femoral competence in postthrombotic reflux. Although these preliminary results are encouraging, long-term follow-up and a larger series are required to validate the technique.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to reduce cardiovascular mortality, patients with atherosclerotic arterial disease should undergo risk factor modification according to the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Secondary Prevention Guidelines (hereafter, Guideline). We assessed compliance with the Guideline in a group of patients seen in a vascular surgery practice.\nWe evaluated 200 consecutive patients with lower-extremity occlusive disease, cerebrovascular disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm seen by a university-based vascular surgery practice. The subjects were patients who had been seen previously in our clinic (ESTABLISHED) and new referrals (NEW). Data pertinent to each of the nine AHA/ACC Guideline goals were collected from patient interviews, medication histories, and laboratory records. Compliance with each of the Guideline goals was evaluated. Differences in compliance between ESTABLISHED and NEW patient groups were also compared. We also recorded whether a patient had a previous endovascular or open surgical vascular intervention (EVENT or NO EVENT). Differences in compliance between the EVENT and NO EVENT groups were compared.\nMost patients did not achieve the secondary prevention goals recommended in the Guideline. Patients who had a prior vascular intervention (EVENT) were significantly more likely to achieve goals for low-density lipoprotein level (43% vs 23%), and for statin (71% vs 39%), beta-blocker (46% vs 27%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (53% vs. 35%), and antiplatelet agent (85% vs. 68%) use (P < .05). ESTABLISHED patients were significantly more likely than NEW patients to have a prior EVENT (87% vs 47%, P < .0005). ESTABLISHED patients were significantly more likely than NEW patients to achieve goals for low-density lipoprotein level, beta-blocker, and statin use; however, these differences were likely due to the higher proportion of EVENT patients in the ESTABLISHED group.\nCompliance with the Guideline is suboptimal in patients with atherosclerotic arterial disease. Secondary prevention goals were more often achieved in the EVENT patient group, suggesting that a vascular intervention may lead to increased patient and physician awareness and compliance with the Guideline. A targeted effort towards risk factor modification in patients with atherosclerotic arterial disease could improve compliance with the Guideline and reduce cardiovascular mortality.",

    "abstract": "Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer (DD) have been associated with the presence and progression of various forms of atherosclerotic disease, particularly coronary heart disease. We hypothesize that there is a relationship between elevated levels of baseline CRP and DD and progression of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with symptomatic PAD. The current study is a prospective evaluation of this hypothesis.\nBetween 1996 and 2003, 384 subjects were enrolled in a National Institutes of Health-sponsored blinded, prospective trial evaluating the effects of multiple atherosclerotic risk factors on progression of symptomatic PAD. Baseline levels of CRP and D-dimer were obtained in 332 subjects. Subjects were followed every 6 months with clinical history and exam, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI), and carotid artery duplex scanning (CDS). The primary study end point was a composite of ABI progression, CDS progression, stroke, myocardial infarction, amputation, and death from cardiovascular disease. Secondary end points included each of the components of the primary end point. The relationship between time to the various endpoints and baseline CRP and DD levels was examined by life-table analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis.\nAdequate baseline samples for CRP and DD were available in 332 subjects (mean age, 67 years; 57.8% men) with mean follow-up of 38.4 months (range, 1 to 99 months). Mean baseline levels (+/- SD) for CRP were 0.8 +/- 1.14 (range, 0.03 to 13.0), and mean DD levels were 227.4 +/- 303.3 (range, 1.9 to 2744.8). Progression, as defined by the primary end point, occurred in 48.5% of subjects. Subjects with elevated CRP (highest tertile) were no more likely to have any of the progression end points than those with the lowest values (lowest tertile) (P = NS, log-rank test, for all comparisons). By univariate analysis, subjects with elevated DD (highest tertile) were significantly more likely to die from any cause compared with subjects with the lowest DD values (lowest tertile) (P = .03, log-rank test). They were, however, no more likely to reach any of the other progression end points, including the primary end point (P = NS, log-rank test for all other comparisons). Multivariate analysis showed that DD level was a significant independent variable associated with occurrence of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 2.3; P = .02).\nIn subjects with symptomatic PAD, elevated baseline DD, a marker of thrombotic activity, was significantly associated with the occurrence of myocardial infarction. This study did not confirm a relationship between progression of PAD and baseline DD or CRP during the first 3 years. Baseline DD and CRP do not provide useful risk stratification in patients at high risk for progression of symptomatic PAD. Future studies should evaluate serial levels of these markers to assess their utility in predicting progression of symptomatic PAD.",

Thirteen T2DM with no severe complications and 13 healthy subjects completed the trial.\nTreatment with valsartan in T2DM improved the resting forearm skin blood flow and increased the resting brachial artery diameter but had no effects on arterial blood pressure, large vessel vascular reactivity, or carotid intima-media thickness. Resting skin blood flow increased by 60% (2%-90%; median and 25th-75th percentiles) during valsartan treatment and by only 2% (-22% to 27%) during placebo treatment (P < .05). No changes were observed in the nondiabetic subjects. Immunostaining studies of forearm skin biopsy samples from T2DM and healthy subjects showed that valsartan reduced poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity in 50% (6/12) of the subjects. PARP activity remained unchanged in placebo-treated subjects (P < .02). In addition, valsartan treatment increased CD31 staining in 33% (4/12) of the subjects, whereas no change was noted in sequential skin biopsy samples of placebo-treated subjects (P = .057). Valsartan had no effect on the biochemical markers of endothelial cell activation and other cytokines, including CAMs, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and plasma activator inhibitor 1.\nValsartan increases the resting skin blood flow in T2DM, likely through reduction of PARP activity.",

    "abstract": "Eicosanoids with vasodilating and angiogenic properties have been postulated to be effective therapies for critical leg ischemia (CLI) secondary to atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. The ability to deliver active drug to the site of action at adequate doses for sufficient duration has been a major limitation in the clinical development of such therapies. Lipo-ecraprost is a lipid-encapsulated prostaglandin E1 prodrug with the potential to deliver active prostaglandin to the site of critical arterial ischemia. The current trial was designed to test the hypothesis that lipo-ecraprost would improve amputation-free survival in patients with CLI who had no revascularization options.\nThe study was randomized, multicenter, double blind, and placebo controlled. Patients who met clinical and hemodynamic criteria were randomized to receive placebo or lipo-ecraprost (60 microg) administered intravenously on each of 5 days per week, for a total of 8 weeks. The study's primary endpoint was the rate of a composite end point of death or amputation above the level of the ankle at 180 days (6 months).\nThe study was terminated on a recommendation from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board after the completion of a protocol-specified interim analysis for futility. At the time of termination, 383 of the planned 560 patients had been randomized, of which 379 received at least one dose of study medication and thus were included in the intention-to-treat population. Twenty-three patients were lost to follow-up and were not available for 6-month assessments. At 6 months of follow-up, there were 23 amputations in the 177 patients who received placebo, and 29 amputations in the 179 patients randomized to lipo-ecraprost. At 6 months, 10 deaths had occurred in the placebo group and 18 deaths had occurred in the lipo-ecraprost arm. Changes in lower-extremity hemodynamics over the 6-month study period did not differ between the placebo and lipo-ecraprost treatment arms.\nIntensive treatment with lipo-ecraprost failed to modify the 6-month amputation rate in patients with CLI who were not candidates for revascularization.",

At the time of termination, 383 of the planned 560 patients had been randomized, of which 379 received at least one dose of study medication and thus were included in the intention-to-treat population. Twenty-three patients were lost to follow-up and were not available for 6-month assessments. At 6 months of follow-up, there were 23 amputations in the 177 patients who received placebo, and 29 amputations in the 179 patients randomized to lipo-ecraprost. At 6 months, 10 deaths had occurred in the placebo group and 18 deaths had occurred in the lipo-ecraprost arm. Changes in lower-extremity hemodynamics over the 6-month study period did not differ between the placebo and lipo-ecraprost treatment arms.",

    "abstract": "The PREVENT III study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase III trial of a novel molecular therapy (edifoligide; E2F decoy) for the prevention of vein graft failure in patients undergoing infrainguinal revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nFrom November 2001 through October 2003, 1404 patients with CLI were randomized to a single intraoperative ex vivo vein graft treatment with edifoligide or placebo. After surgery, patients underwent graft surveillance by duplex ultrasonography and were followed up for index graft and limb end points to 1 year. A blinded Clinical Events Classification committee reviewed all index graft end points. The primary study end point was the time to nontechnical index graft reintervention or major amputation due to index graft failure. Secondary end points included all-cause graft failure, clinically significant graft stenosis (>70% by angiography or severe stenosis by ultrasonography), amputation/reintervention-free survival, and nontechnical primary graft patency. Event rates were based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Time-to-event end points were compared by using the log-rank test.\nDemographics, comorbidities, and procedural details reflected a population with CLI and diffuse atherosclerosis. Tissue loss was the presenting symptom in 75% of patients. High-risk conduits were used in 24% of cases, including an alternative vein in 20% (15% spliced vein and 5% non-great saphenous vein) and 6% less than 3 mm in diameter; 14% of the cases were reoperative bypass grafts. Most (65%) grafts were placed to infrapopliteal targets. Perioperative (30-day) mortality occurred in 2.7% of patients. Major morbidity included myocardial infarction in 4.7% and early graft occlusion in 5.2% of patients. Ex vivo treatment with edifoligide was well tolerated. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the primary or secondary trial end points, primary graft patency, or limb salvage. A statistically significant improvement was observed in secondary graft patency (estimated Kaplan-Meier rates were 83% edifoligide and 78% placebo; P = .016) within 1 year. The reduction in secondary patency events was manifest within 30 days of surgery (the relative risk for a 30-day event for edifoligide was 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.76; P = .005). For the overall cohort at 1 year, the estimated Kaplan-Meier rate for survival was 84%, that for primary patency was 61%, that for primary assisted patency was 77%, that for secondary patency was 80%, and that for limb salvage was 88%.\nIn this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, ex vivo treatment of lower extremity vein grafts with edifoligide did not confer protection from reintervention for graft failure.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the value of intraoperative blood flow measurements on early and long-term patency of above-knee prosthetic femoropopliteal bypass.\nFlow was measured with a transit time flowmeter before (basal flow) and after an intragraft injection of papaverine (papaverine flow) in 87 operations (86 patients) between January 1990 and December 2001. Sixty-one grafts were of polyester, and 26 were of polytetrafluoroethylene. The operations were done under epidural anesthesia. The preoperative angiographic run-off score and clinical risk factors were recorded. Patency rates were analyzed with the product limit method and compared with the log-rank test. Variables found to be near significantly related to patency rates (P < .1) were included in a multivariate analysis performed with the Cox proportional hazard model.\nBasal flow measurements were not related to patency. The 2- and 5-year patency rates for grafts with a papaverine flow < or = 500 mL/min were 48% and 18% compared with 66% and 52% for grafts with a papaverine flow > or = 500 mL/min. These differences were statistically significant (P = .012, hazard ratio, 2.6). Two- and 5-year patency rates for smokers vs nonsmokers were 44% and 18% vs 69% and 54%. The patency rates for patients with poor vs good run-off were 42% and 27% vs 66% and 31%. Smoking (P = .008, hazard ratio, 2.75) and poor run-off score (P = .009, hazard ratio, 2.38) were found to be independent risk factors for reduced patency rates. Poor run-off score did not correlate with low values of measured basal or papaverine flow.\nPapaverine flow of < or = 500 mL/min is associated with reduced mid- and long-term patency rates. Additional antithrombotic medication and frequent follow-up for these grafts should be considered. The inferior patency rates of smokers and patients with poor run-off indicate that prosthetic bypass is less suitable for these groups of patients.",

    "abstract": "This study is retrospective cohort study of data on vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery collected during 14 years at a general hospital. We investigated factors in the development of vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery and the effect of vocal cord paralysis on clinical course and outcome.\nWe reviewed data for 182 patients who underwent aortic arch surgery for aortic arch aneurysm and aortic dissection between 1989 and 2003, of whom 58 patients had proximal aortic repair, 62 had distal arch repair, and 62 had total arch repair. We assessed factors associated with the development of vocal cord paralysis and examined in detail the clinical outcome of patients with vocal cord paralysis.\nPostoperative vocal cord paralysis occurred in 40 patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the following risk factors with odds ratios (OR) for vocal cord paralysis: extension of procedures into distal arch (OR, 17.0), chronic dilatation of the aorta at the left subclavian artery (OR, 9.14), and total arch repair (OR, 4.24). Adoption of open-style stent-grafts reduced the incidence of vocal cord paralysis (OR, 0.031). The postoperative occurrence of vocal cord paralysis itself emerges as an independent predictor of pulmonary complications (OR, 4.12) and leads to a longer duration of hospital stay.\nThe risk of vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery depends on surgical factors, such as aneurysmal involvement of the distal arch, or the application of newer, less invasive surgical procedures. Vocal cord paralysis after aortic arch surgery itself, under aggressive postoperative respiratory management, did not increase aspiration pneumonia but was associated with postoperative complications leading to higher hospital mortality and prolonged hospitalization.",

    "results": "Postoperative vocal cord paralysis occurred in 40 patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the following risk factors with odds ratios (OR) for vocal cord paralysis: extension of procedures into distal arch (OR, 17.0), chronic dilatation of the aorta at the left subclavian artery (OR, 9.14), and total arch repair (OR, 4.24). Adoption of open-style stent-grafts reduced the incidence of vocal cord paralysis (OR, 0.031). The postoperative occurrence of vocal cord paralysis itself emerges as an independent predictor of pulmonary complications (OR, 4.12) and leads to a longer duration of hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Systemic hypotension has been observed for up to 36 hours in response to stimulation of the carotid baroreceptor by carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). The aim of this study was to identify risk factors and cardiac outcomes for postprocedural hypotension requiring vasopressor support after CAS.\nBetween 2003 and 2005, 143 patients (87 men; mean age, 75 years) with high-grade carotid artery stenosis (mean, 87.3%) were treated with CAS and prospectively entered into a vascular registry. Data were retrospectively analyzed to determine factors predictive of hypotension requiring vasopressor support after CAS. Atropine and appropriate intravenous crystalloid solution were administered during CAS. For the first 30 patients, atropine was only used for symptomatic patients but then became routine and was used for all patients with primary carotid stenosis. Hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or a mean arterial blood pressure <50 mm Hg) unresponsive to conservative measures was treated with vasopressors (phenylephrine or norepinephrine). Patients were stratified into three groups based on hypotension requiring vasopressors: (1) no vasopressors, (2) vasopressors for < or = 24 hours (short duration), and (3) vasopressors for >24 hours (prolonged duration). Risk factors for hypotension requiring vasopressors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nPostprocedural hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment was seen in 16 (11%) of 143 of patients, with 6 (4%) requiring vasopressor support for >24 hours. Mean duration of vasopressor administration for all patients was 17 +/- 10 hours (range, 6 to 36 hours). By univariate analysis, a history of a previous myocardial infarction (P = .02) or use of the PercuSurge occlusion balloon (P = .05) were both associated with increased incidence of short duration (</=24 hours) use of vasopressors, and female sex (P = .03) and age >80 years old (P = .02) were associated with prolonged (>24 hours) vasopressor requirement. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age and sex, a history of myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 16.4; P = .05) remained an independent predictor of short-duration vasopressors. On multivariate analysis, female sex (OR, 10.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 100.4; P = .04) and age >80 years old (OR, 13.8, 95% CI, 1.5 to 127.2; P = .02) remained independent predictors of prolonged vasopressor use. The incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarctions, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure did not differ between those patients who did not receive vasopressors (5/127) and those who received vasopressors for a short (< or = 24 hours) duration (1/10, P = NS) or prolonged (>24 hours) duration (0/6, P = NS).\nProlonged hypotension requiring vasopressor support occurs in a minority of patients after CAS, with higher incidences in older women. In contrast, hypotension requiring a more limited duration of vasopressor use occurs more commonly in patients who had a prior myocardial infarction, independent of age or sex. In this cohort of patients, vasopressors required for hypotension were not associated with an increased incidence of periprocedural cardiac complications. Despite the increased incidence of prolonged hypotension in older women, this study demonstrates that CAS can be performed without an increase in cardiac morbidity in older women.",

    "abstract": "In patients with aortoiliac occlusion, the internal thoracic artery-inferior epigastric artery (ITA-IEA) collateral is one of the collaterals supplying blood flow to the lower extremity, and the interruption of this collateral may cause severe leg ischemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate by color duplex ultrasonography scans the ITA-IEA pathway and its significance as a collateral in providing lower-extremity perfusion in aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nColor duplex ultrasonography scans were prospectively performed in 64 consecutive patients with aortoiliac occlusion. Blood flow measurement in the ITA, IEA, and common femoral artery was done on both sides. The patients were stratified according to occlusion level (aorta, common iliac artery, external iliac artery), and the data obtained from such groups were compared.\nIn 95% of patients with aortoiliac occlusion, the ITA-IEA pathway was functioning as a collateral, with mean collateral flow of 66 +/- 48 mL/min, and its average contribution to lower-extremity perfusion was 38% +/- 23%. Additionally, a moderately positive correlation was found between flows of ITA and IEA (r = 0.55, P < .0001). Depending on the level of occlusion, the collateral flow and its contribution to perfusion progressively decreased from the proximal to distal aortoiliac occlusion level. Furthermore, the difference in the ITA-IEA flow volume was statistically significant between occlusion levels (P = .009), but the differences in the perfusion contribution were not different among levels (P = .311). There was also no statistical difference between the groups concerning collateral flow volume and contribution to lower-extremity perfusion in relation to unilateral or bilateral occlusion of the iliac artery, the state of distal run-off being good or poor, or the clinical findings being mild or severe.\nIn patients with aortoiliac occlusion, the ITA-IEA collateral pathway is an important route providing lower-extremity perfusion. Additionally, Doppler sonographic flow measurements of the contribution of the ITA-IEA route to lower-extremity perfusion may provide beneficial diagnostic information necessary for the pretreatment work-up of patients with aortoiliac occlusion, especially for whom the ITA is planned to be used as a coronary artery graft.",

    "abstract": "Endoaneurysmorrhaphy with intraluminal graft placement, described by Creech, is the gold standard for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair has gained popularity for its minimal invasiveness and satisfying short-term results, but there are still many concerns about the long-term success of the procedure. Since 1998, laparoscopic surgery has been proposed for AAA treatment. The potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure reproducing the endoaneurysmorrhaphy results over time have been advocated. In our experience, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) has been routinely used for the open-surgery transperitoneal/retroperitoneal approach and for endovascular aneurysm repair. After 4 years, we are able to define the early and middle-term results of such laparoscopic-assisted treatment.\nFrom October 2000 to March 2004, 604 consecutive nonurgent AAAs were treated at our institution. Of these, 122 (20.2%) were treated by HALS. Exclusion criteria for HALS were hostile abdomen (previous major abdominal or aortic surgery), bilateral diffuse common iliac and/or hypogastric aneurysms, massive aortoiliac calcifications, and severe cardiac (ejection fraction <35%) and respiratory (P(O2) <60 mm Hg or carbon dioxide >50 mm Hg) insufficiency. Juxtarenal and proximal iliac aneurysms were not a contraindication, nor was obesity. In all patients, we performed a minilaparotomy (7-8 cm) both for laparoscopic hand-assisted dissection and for endoaneurysmorrhaphy. All perioperative data were prospectively recorded. Follow-up consisted of ultrasonography and clinical evaluation after 6 and 12 months and then every year after surgery.\nThe mean laparoscopic and total operative times were respectively 64 +/- 32 minutes and 257 +/- 70 minutes, the mean aortic cross-clamping time was 76 +/- 26 minutes, and the mean autotransfused blood volume was 1136 +/- 711 mL. The overall mortality and morbidity were respectively 0% and 12.2%. Morbidity was surgery related in only two cases (bleeding from an ipogastric artery lesion and a leg graft thrombosis). The mean intensive care unit stay was 14.3 +/- 13 hours. Oral food intake was resumed after 27.4 +/- 15 hours, and patients were discharged after a mean of 4.4 +/- 1.7 days. Operative times were not affected by obesity, suprarenal aortic cross-clamping, or aneurysm size. Both concomitant iliac aneurysms and bifurcated graft implantation (related to longer vascular reconstruction) involved significantly longer operative times. The learning curve of the procedure (comparing the first 30 patients with the last 92 patients) led to significantly shorter endoscopic, cross-clamping, and total operative times (P = .000). The mean follow-up was 28.6 +/- 16 months. Three incisional hernias and one case of bowel occlusion were detected. All these cases (3.4%) required laparoscopic treatment.\nThe HALS technique is a safe and minimally invasive treatment for AAA; it is useful for limiting the need for conventional open surgery and reducing the length of hospital stay. Despite the lack of randomized studies, HALS seems to be associated with a better postoperative course than standard open surgery. HALS can also be considered as an equivalent of a well-established procedure and as a bridge between open and total laparoscopic surgery.",

The aim of this prospective study, with histologic evaluation of the sigmoid colon mucosa, was to assess the influence of replanting the IMA on IC and mortality.\nFrom January 1999 to December 2003, 160 consecutive patients who were operated on for a symptomatic (n = 21) or asymptomatic (n = 139) infrarenal aortic aneurysm were prospectively assessed and randomly assigned either to replanting or ligating the IMA. Sigmoidoscopy with biopsy was performed on day 4 or 5 after surgery; an autopsy was performed on patients not surviving to day 5 after surgery. All patients gave written informed consent.\nOf the 160 randomized patients, 128 had a confirmed patent IMA and formed the basis of this study. Their age was 70 +/- 8 years (men, 70 +/- 8 years; women, 73 +/- 7 years). The IMA was replanted in 67 patients (52%) and ligated in 61 (48%) intraoperatively. IC developed in six patients with a replanted IMA and in 10 with a ligated IMA (relative risk [RR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 1.41; chi2 = 1.62; P = .203). Blood loss in the two cohorts did not differ significantly (P = .788); however, patients with IC had a significantly higher blood loss compared with the cohort without IC (P = .012) and were older (P = .017). Age, sex distribution, clamping time, the use of tube or bifurcated grafts, and intraoperative hypotension did not differ between patients with ligated or replanted IMA.\nAlthough replanting the IMA did not confer a statistically significant reduction of perioperative morbidity or mortality in this study, it appears that older patients and patients with increased intraoperative blood loss might benefit from IMA replantation, because this maneuver does not increase perioperative morbidity or substantially increase operation time.",

    "abstract": "Patients with blunt traumatic thoracic aortic transection (BTTAT) just distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery typically have concomitant injuries that make open emergent surgical repair highly risky. Over the past decade, endovascular repair of the injured thoracic aorta with commercially available and custom-made covered stents has developed as a viable option, with reported decreases in short-term morbidity and mortality. If active extravasation of contrast from the injured thoracic aorta is not appreciated on chest computed tomography scan, other concurrent injuries of the head, abdomen, and extremities can often be repaired with careful control of blood pressure. The timing of endovascular repair of the traumatic thoracic aortic transection, however, often comes into question, particularly with the presence of fever, pneumonia, or bacteremia. We sought to identify a time frame during which endovascular repair of BTTAT could safely be performed.\nAge, concomitant injuries, time from trauma to repair, type of device, and major outcomes were recorded.\nOver a 5-year period (January 2000 to March 2005), 51 patients presented with BTTAT. Twenty-seven (52.9%) patients with BTTAT died shortly after arrival. Of the remaining 24, 9 underwent emergent open repair, with 1 intraoperative death. Two delayed open repairs were performed. Thirteen patients with BTTAT underwent delayed endovascular repair. Successful endovascular repair of BTTAT was performed in all 13 patients, with no intraoperative deaths. Seven patients were treated with commercial devices and six with custom-made covered stents. None of the repairs was performed emergently. The timing of repair ranged from 1 day to 7 months (median, 6 days), and all patients were treated aggressively with beta-blockade before surgery. One patient was discharged from the hospital and underwent elective repair at a later date. Three patients died in the postoperative period (30 days): two from multisystem organ failure and one from iliac artery complications encountered at the time of device deployment. The remaining 10 patients were successfully discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nThe opportunity to successfully perform endovascular repair of BTTAT may be possible many days after the initial injury in the hemodynamically stable trauma patient.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate preoperative work-up, intra-operative strategy, and outcomes of endovascular stent-grafting of the thoracic aorta in patients undergoing elective repair and those undergoing emergent repair.\nAll patient information was obtained by a retrospective review of an established clinical database for all endovascular thoracic stent-graft cases. From October 1999 to August 2005, 70 patients were treated with endovascular stent-grafts for lesions of the thoracic aorta. Thirty-five patients had an elective endovascular procedure, and 35 patients had an emergent procedure.\nThirty-five patients in the endovascular (EL) group were treated for aneurysm (n = 34) and type B dissection (n = 1). Thirty-five patients in the emergent (EM) group were treated for aneurysm (n = 10), intramural hematoma (n = 10), type B dissection (n = 7), traumatic rupture (n = 7), and aortoesophageal fistula (n = 1). Preoperative angiography was performed in 94.3% (33/35) of EL patients but in only 45.7% (16/35) EM patients (P < .005). The EM procedures had significantly shorter operative times, used lower contrast volumes, used fewer stent-graft components (mode 2, range 1 to 5 vs mode 1, range 1 to 3; P = .02), and spinal cerebrospinal fluid drains were used significantly less often (82.9% vs 57.1%, P = .04). Both groups had similar 30-day morbidity, mortality (0/35 EL vs 1/35 [2.9%] EM, P = .99), postoperative endoleak (9/35 [25.7%] EL vs 7/35 [20.0%] EM, P = .78), endovascular failure (3/35 [8.6%] EL vs 5/35 [14.3%] EM, P = .71), and patient survival.\nThere are significant differences in the underlying pathology, preoperative evaluation, and operative course between elective and emergency treatment endovascular procedures for lesions of the thoracic aorta. Endovascular repair of thoracic aortic lesions can be accomplished with low perioperative mortality and morbidity rates, as well as acceptable endoleak and endovascular failure rates for both elective and emergency procedures.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the consistency and variance in EVAR suitability assessment between clinicians.\nWorksheets that contained anatomic data derived from computed tomography scans and angiography were compiled for 202 patients. Five clinicians, all experienced in EVAR surgery, assessed the anatomic data on the worksheets for suitability for three types of stent-grafts. The obtained 3030 assessments represented a quantification of the likelihood of success the clinician expected for effective and durable sealing and fixation of the stent-graft in EVAR. The Delphi method was used to determine consensus in the thinking process among clinicians, and kappa analysis was used to determine the proportion of variances in the assessment result between clinicians.\nWith the Delphi method, Cronbach alpha values of 0.87, 0.87, and 0.90 were reached for the three types of stent-grafts in the second assessment round. The individual clinician-group correlation in round two was between 0.69 and 0.86 for clinicians 1, 2, 3, and 4. Between clinician 5 and the others, correlation varied between 0.43 and 0.64. The kappa values ranged between 0.32 and 0.51 among clinicians 1, 2, and 3. Between clinician 5 and the others, kappa values between 0.08 and 0.29 were reached.\nEVAR suitability estimation in a cohort of patients is highly consistent in a group of experienced clinicians. The EVAR suitability estimation at the individual patient level varies substantially between clinicians, however. Aggregating expert opinions in abdominal aortic aneurysm anatomic suitability assessment for EVAR had the opportunity to replace individual clinician decision diversification in a more solid and consistent group decision process.",

    "abstract": "Endograft limb occlusion is an infrequent but serious complication of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The insertion of additional stents within the endograft limb may prevent future occlusion. This study evaluates limb patency with and without adjunctive stenting of endograft limbs at the time of endovascular AAA repair.\nWe performed a retrospective review of 248 patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with the Zenith AAA endovascular graft between 1999 and 2004. Among these patients, two groups were identified: 64 patients with adjunctive stents placed in 85 limbs and 184 patients without additional bare stent placement in endograft limbs at the time of endovascular AAA repair.\nWomen comprised 23% of stented and 11% of unstented patients (P = .02). The mean length of follow-up in the stented and unstented groups was 2.0 years. There were 13 instances of limb thrombosis in 13 patients (5.2% of patients, 2.7% of limbs), all in the unstented group. No limb occlusions occurred in the presence of adjunctive bare metal stents. Seventy-three percent of the occlusions occurred < or = 6 months of endovascular AAA repair. Two patients (15%) had no symptoms of lower-extremity ischemia despite graft limb occlusion and did not undergo intervention. The others underwent thrombectomy (n = 2), thrombectomy with bare stent placement (n = 3), femoral-femoral bypass (n = 4), thrombolysis (n = 1), and thrombolysis with bare stent placement (n = 1). Of the seven who underwent thrombectomy or thrombolysis, three had no additional stents placed at the secondary procedure, and two of these three went on to rethrombose. By life-table analysis, primary patency at 3 years in the stented and nonstented limbs was 100% +/- 0% and 94% +/- 3%, respectively (P = .05).\nThe intraoperative insertion of additional bare metal stents appeared to eliminate the risk of thrombosis and was without complication. Of the 85 stented limbs in this series, not one occluded. The overall rate of limb thrombosis was low, with most limb occlusions occurring < or = 6 months of stent-graft insertion, and would probably have been even lower had we been able to identify all high-risk cases for prophylactic adjunctive stenting. Limb occlusion denotes an underlying problem with the graft, which if left untreated after thrombectomy or thrombolysis will lead to rethrombosis. Postoperative imaging was of little value in detecting impending limb occlusion. Based on these findings, we believe one should identify and stent any limbs that appear to be at risk for thrombosis, but this study lacks the data to predict which limbs need stenting.",

There were 13 instances of limb thrombosis in 13 patients (5.2% of patients, 2.7% of limbs), all in the unstented group. No limb occlusions occurred in the presence of adjunctive bare metal stents. Seventy-three percent of the occlusions occurred < or = 6 months of endovascular AAA repair. Two patients (15%) had no symptoms of lower-extremity ischemia despite graft limb occlusion and did not undergo intervention. The others underwent thrombectomy (n = 2), thrombectomy with bare stent placement (n = 3), femoral-femoral bypass (n = 4), thrombolysis (n = 1), and thrombolysis with bare stent placement (n = 1). Of the seven who underwent thrombectomy or thrombolysis, three had no additional stents placed at the secondary procedure, and two of these three went on to rethrombose. By life-table analysis, primary patency at 3 years in the stented and nonstented limbs was 100% +/- 0% and 94% +/- 3%, respectively (P = .05).",

    "abstract": "Most clinical end points after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are endograft-specific, but type II endoleaks have been assumed to be an unavoidable consequence of the repair method and independent of the type of endograft used. Some recent data have suggested that the rate of type II endoleaks may also be graft-dependent. We reviewed a large clinical experience with six endografts to determine the behavior of type II endoleaks and whether they are graft-specific.\nAll elective EVAR cases from five university institutions from 1996 to 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. Endografts used in <50 patients were excluded. Endoleaks were diagnosed and classified from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans by the treating surgeons. Results of angiography and interventions for endoleaks were tracked. The rate of type II endoleaks was compared among endografts at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.\nDuring the study period, 1909 patients underwent elective EVAR and had an adequate imaging follow-up at one of the specified time points. At 1 month, the overall rate of type II endoleak was 14.0% (range, 9.8% to 25.2%.) The Excluder had a significantly higher incidence of type II endoleaks at 1 month but was similar to most other grafts during longer follow-up. At 6 months, the overall rate of type II endoleak was 16.3% (range, 8.3% to 16.8%). The Talent and Lifepath had an apparent lower initial rate of type II leaks, but this was only significant for the Talent at 6 months compared with Excluder, Zenith, and Ancure, and at 1 year compared with Excluder and Zenith. No graft had a long-term statistically significant difference in the rate of type II endoleak formation. Intervention rates varied by institution and graft type but in general were quite low. Of 25 successful interventions (Ancure, 12; AneuRx, 8; Excluder, 2; Lifepath, 2; Zenith, 1; Talent, 0), 21 were performed during the first year. Interim spontaneous resolution, defined as a negative CT scan after a CT positive for endoleak, was high, especially in the first year. Resolution of type II endoleaks occurred in 54 (33%) of 164 between 1 and 6 months, in 37 (33%) of 112 between 6 and 12 months, in 20 (35%) of 57 from 12 to 24 months, and in 5 (20%) of 25 between 24 and 36 months. The various grafts had a nearly identical pattern, but the rates were highest for the Talent. Late appearing endoleaks, defined as a positive CT after a negative CT, were frequent. At 6 months, 44 (30%) of 147 type II endoleaks were newly diagnosed. The rates were 37 (35%) of 107 at 12 months, 15 (27%) of 56 at 2 years and 5 (25%) of 20 at 3 years. No conversions to open repair for type II endoleaks were noted in the first 4 years. The thrombus burden could not be determined in this analysis.\nType II endoleaks occur in nearly 15% of patients treated by EVAR. The early incidence varies only slightly with graft type. The long-term prevalence and clinical significance are masked by different treatment patterns, spontaneous resolution, newly evident endoleaks, and aneurysm size at initial treatment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between aneurysm sac size change at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months and a set of 10 independent \"predictive\" variables by using a general linear model analysis.\nIn a multicenter trial, 351 patients received the Zenith tri-modular bifurcated endograft. The predictive variables used for this analysis were endoleak by type, age, gender, smoking status, and the preprocedure variables of maximum aneurysm major diameter, minor neck diameter, proximal neck length, neck plaque/thrombus, and neck shape; and patent inferior mesenteric artery at predischarge. The aneurysm change was calculated as the difference from the predischarge (< or = 7 days of implant) maximum aneurysm major diameter measurement to the maximum aneurysm major diameter measurement at follow-up examination periods of 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. The same 10 predictive variables were used to assess the absolute change in maximum aneurysm minor diameter and aneurysm area. Additionally, the percent change from predischarge was also assessed for the major diameter, minor diameter, and aneurysm area.\nNone of the independent variables were predictive of absolute sac size change or percent change at 1 month. At 6 months, the presence of an endoleak (P < .01) and preprocedure neck thrombus/plaque (P = .01) were significant predictors of absolute and relative aneurysm size change for all measurements (major diameter, minor diameter, and area) and were more likely to be associated with less sac shrinkage or to have sac growth. Additionally, preoperative maximum aneurysm major diameter was a significant predictor for absolute change in area (P < .01). Larger preprocedure aneurysm diameters were more likely to experience more shrinkage. The significant predictors of size change at 12 months included preprocedure maximum aneurysm major diameter, the presence of endoleak at 12 months, preoperative neck thrombus/plaque, and gender. At 24 months, significant predictors of aneurysm size change included preprocedure maximum aneurysm major diameter, endoleak at 24 months, and preprocedure neck thrombus/plaque. When the longitudinal model was used, the presence of an endoleak, thrombus/plaque within the proximal neck at preprocedure, and preprocedure maximum aneurysm major diameter were found to be significantly related to the size of the maximum aneurysm major diameter over time.\nThis study supports the concept that early and late sac size change following EVAR is influenced by identifiable independent predictive variables.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty with stent placement (CAS) may offer an alternative treatment to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, in contrast to CEA, which has been shown to normalize impaired cerebral hemodynamics, the effects of CAS remain unclear. To investigate alterations in cerebral hemodynamics, we prospectively studied patients undergoing CAS and compared them with a group of similar patients undergoing CEA.\nTwenty-three patients undergoing CAS for recently symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were prospectively studied. Volume flow in the ICAs and basilar artery (BA) were measured with magnetic resonance volume flow quantification before CAS and 1 month after. The results were compared with those in 13 similar patients undergoing CEA and 40 control subjects without ICA stenosis.\nAfter CAS, volume flow in the ipsilateral ICA increased from 114 +/- 17 to 231 +/- 17 mL/min (P < .001), and total volume flow (ICAs plus BA) increased from 495 +/- 24 to 552 +/- 28 mL/min (P < .05). No significant changes were seen in the contralateral ICA and BA after CAS. Total volume flow and flow in the stenosed ICA normalized after CAS compared with control subjects. Volume flow values similarly improved after CEA.\nCAS results in a normalization of impaired cerebral hemodynamics, as assessed by magnetic resonance volume flow measurements. The degree of improvement is similar to that seen after CEA.",

    "abstract": "As the number of endovascular interventions increase and resources become scarce, surgeons need to be aware of cost-effective and efficient practice options. Many surgeons routinely admit their patients for overnight observation after uneventful endovascular interventions. Although this may be appropriate for patients with tissue loss and rest pain, we believe that peripheral angioplasty in patients with claudication can be safely performed as an outpatient procedure with significant cost savings.\nAll patients with intermittent claudication undergoing peripheral angioplasty by a single vascular surgeon were enrolled prospectively in a same-day discharge protocol. Involved arteries and use of stent and closure device were recorded. Time to mobilization and time to discharge were determined. Patients were observed in an observation unit by a registered nurse, and were examined by the surgeon at the time of ambulation and before discharge. Patients were admitted to the hospital if complications arose during the predetermined observation period. Periprocedural complications and reasons for admission were noted. Patients were evaluated at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 3 to 6 months after the intervention.\nDuring 27 months, 112 interventions were performed in 97 patients. The superficial femoral artery was the most frequent site of intervention (47%). Multiple sites had angioplasty in 27 (24%) procedures. Nine (8%) procedures resulted in admission. One patient was admitted for a major puncture site hematoma requiring blood transfusion, two patients for observation of a minor hematoma at the puncture site, one for chest pain, and one for observation of transient bradycardia. The mean time to mobilization was 1.4 +/- 1.3 hours, and the mean time to discharge was 2.8 +/- 1.2 hours. The average postprocedural cost for patients undergoing same-day discharge was $320 per patient, which contrasts with $1800 for routine overnight observation. No deaths or unplanned admissions to the hospital occurred < or =30 days of intervention.\nSame-day discharge after peripheral angioplasty is safe and cost-effective. Need for admission is evident within 2 hours. Routine admission after peripheral angioplasty for patients with claudication is unnecessary and should no longer be the standard of care.",

    "abstract": "In large randomized trials, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic stenosis has shown a net benefit compared with best medical treatment. To justify an increased number of procedures for this indication, the perioperative risk of stroke or death must not exceed that of the trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome in routine clinical practice in Sweden in a population-based study.\nThe Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) covers all centers performing CEA. Data on all registered CEAs during 1994 to 2003 were analyzed both for the whole time period and for two 5-year periods to study alterations over time. Four validation procedures of the registry were performed. Medical records were reviewed for both a random sample and a target sample (a total of 12% of the CEAs for asymptomatic stenosis). Swedvasc data were cross-matched with the In-Patient-Registry (used for reimbursement) and the Population-registry (death).\nA total of 6182 CEAs were registered, 671 being for asymptomatic stenosis. In the validation process, no missed registration of major stroke or death was found. Patients with asymptomatic stenosis had, when the whole time-period was analyzed, a perioperative combined stroke or death rate of 2.1%. Outcome improved over time; the combined stroke or death rate decreased from 3.3% (11/330) from 1994 to 1998 to 0.9% (3/341) from 1999 to 2003 (P = .026). During the second time period, no patient with a perioperative major stroke or death was reported.\nThis extensively validated national audit of CEA for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis showed results well comparable with those of the randomized trials. The results improved over time.",

    "abstract": "We present four patients with rapidly progressive claudication of the lower limbs due to extracranial giant cell arteritis. Additional findings suggestive of giant cell arteritis were involvement of the axillary or brachial arteries in two patients, symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis in three, and all patients had severely elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Lower limb involvement affected preferentially the femoropopliteal, deep femoral, and tibioperoneal arteries. Hypoechogenic, concentric mural thickening suggestive of vasculitis was readily visible in all involved arterial segments by duplex ultrasound imaging, whereas angiography was rather unspecific. Typical changes for large-vessel vasculitis were also detectable by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorine-18-desoxyglucose positron emission tomography. More widespread use of these vascular imaging techniques may show that giant cell arteritis of the lower limbs is more frequent than previously assumed.",

Eight patients with aortoiliac (n = 6) and iliac (n = 2) aneurysms have been treated with this procedure. The technique involves the placement of a hook catheter near the hypogastric artery or in the sac, and the endoprosthesis insertion is done by using the same arteriotomy. The endoprosthesis is deployed and the coil is released. Saline is injected into the sac. The catheter is removed and the balloon at the distal end of the endoprosthesis is inflated. Computed tomography images showed periprosthesis or aneurysm thrombosis. No endoleaks or coils displacement in the sac were found.",

    "abstract": "The W. L. Gore Excluder bifurcated device uses a single-action deployment mechanism with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene string that is stitched to an outer jacket constraining the nitinol self-expanding stent-graft. Under certain anatomic conditions of the proximal neck, the deployment angle of the proximal stent-graft can be difficult to predict and result in the device being seated caudal to the intended landing site just below the lowermost renal artery. This article describes a technique of controlled deployment of the Excluder device where the top of the main bifurcated device is \"flowered\" by slowly pulling the deployment string while being buttressed by an introducer sheath to prevent premature deployment and allow longitudinal positioning of the device. This technique could be used when a more gradual deployment of the Excluder device is desired in angulated or short proximal necks.",

Although long-term results are lacking, most patients seem to benefit in the short-term from EVLT. Reported postoperative complications are limited, consisting usually of pain, ecchymosis, induration, phlebitis, or spot skin burn injuries. The most feared complication is an extension of the saphenous thrombus into the femoral vein, with possible pulmonary embolism. Here we report a septic thrombophlebitis after EVLT resulting in a phlegmonous infection of the whole leg that was treated by surgical drainage. Aggressive local therapy and antibiotic treatment resulted in complete resolution of symptoms and eventual satisfactory healing.",

A 17-year-old male presented with a progressively expanding and pulsatile but otherwise asymptomatic mass in his forehead. The patient's medical history was significant for uveitis since the age of 3, and severe allergic rhinitis, mild asthma, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as a young adolescent. Admission laboratory values included a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. A computed tomography evaluation demonstrated aneurysmal degeneration of the frontal branch of the right superficial temporal artery and confirmed no other cerebrovascular changes. Histologically, the aneurysmal arterial segment demonstrated subacute temporal arteritis. The arterial wall had a primarily lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with rare giant cells and focally marked medial destruction. Additionally, severely obstructive intimal hyperplasia with chronic adventitial and periadvential dense fibrosis was noted. The diagnosis of classic giant cell temporal arteritis was established from the biopsy result. Postoperatively, the patient was treated with prednisone for 3 months. Three years after surgery, the patient remains well and reports no recurrence of temporal artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Microcirculatory impairment caused by chronic venous hypertension is usually not taken into account in chronic venous insufficiency, probably due to lack of practical means to observe it. The objective of this work was to use a new noninvasive technique to access quantitatively the cutaneous microangiopathy in female patients classified according to CEAP from C1 to C5 and matched with healthy controls.\nForty-four patients and 13 healthy subjects (112 lower limbs), with a mean age +/- SD of 48 +/- 8 years, were evaluated by using orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) imaging. Films of the internal perimaleolar region were analyzed by the CapImage software. The microcirculatory parameters evaluated were functional capillary density (number of capillaries with flowing red blood cells/mm), capillary morphology (percentage of abnormal capillaries), diameter (microm) of dermal papilla to quantify edema, diameter of capillary bulk (microm) to assess the degree of change, and diameter capillary limb to detect enlargement. A microcirculatory index combining these five parameters was proposed with I, II, and III stages, indicating normal microcirculation, and moderate and severe microangiopathy, respectively.\nThese microcirculatory parameters were significantly different (P < .05) from control values (C): capillary diameter and capillary morphology from C2 to C5, 8.1 +/- 0.8, 3.6 +/- 5.5 (C), and 9.7 +/- 1.3, 27.5 +/- 17.7 (C2); diameter of dermal papilla and diameter of capillary bulk from C3 to C5, 111.4 +/- 13.5, 52.8 +/- 8.8 (C), and 150.5 +/- 31.7, 87.8 +/- 26.9 (C3); and functional capillary density only from C4 to C5, 20.9 +/- 6.1 (C) and 14.5 +/- 4.5 (C4). The microcirculatory index showed good correlation to CEAP classification.\nIt was possible to quantify the microangiopathy using OPS imaging and to compare the microcirculatory changes of chronic venous insufficiency patients with healthy controls. Two parameters seemed more important to identify the differences between patients and controls: capillary morphology and capillary diameter. The suggested microcirculatory index can possibly demonstrate, in future studies, a prognostic capability when combined with the CEAP classification.",

    "abstract": "The main cause of occlusion and vein graft failure after peripheral and coronary arterial reconstruction is intimal hyperplasia. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) is a pleiotropic cytokine known to have powerful effects on cell growth, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and extracellular matrix synthesis.\nTo investigate the role of TGF-beta1 in intimal hyperplasia, we used adenovirus to deliver to superficial epigastric vein messenger RNA (mRNA) antisense to TGF-beta1 (Ad-AST) or the sequence encoding the bioactive form of TGF-beta1 (Ad-BAT). Infection with \"empty\" virus was used as a control (Ad-CMVpLpA). The treated vein was then used for an interposition graft into rat femoral artery. Grafts were harvested at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks and formalin-fixed for histologic studies or placed in liquid nitrogen for mRNA studies.\nAd-AST treatment resulted in an overall reduction of TGF-beta1 expression (P = .001), and Ad-BAT treatment resulted in an overall increase in TGF-beta1 expression (P = .007). Histologic analysis showed Ad-AST caused reduced collagen build up in the neointima at 12 weeks (P = .0001). Immunohistochemical staining for h-caldesmon at 12 weeks indicated Ad-AST increased smooth muscle cells throughout the vessel wall compared with Ad-CMVpLpA (P = .0024) or Ad-BAT (P = .04). Ad-AST also resulted in reduced CD68-positive cells in the media/adventitia (P = .005 vs Ad-CMVpLpA, P = .01 vs Ad-BAT). To further understand how Ad-AST was influencing the build up of collagen, we performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction on complimentary DNA (cDNA) from homogenates of the vein grafts. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) was increased at 1 week by Ad-BAT (P = .048 vs Ad-CMVpLpA) and decreased by Ad-AST at all time points (P </= .038). The mRNA for collagen-1 alpha-1 was decreased by Ad-AST at 2, 4, and 12 weeks (P < or = .05) and increased by Ad-BAT at 1 week (P = .01).\nTGF-beta1 antisense treatment of vein grafts prevents the accumulation of collagen in the neointima in part by (1) changing the proportions of the cell types populating the vein graft wall, (2) reducing the mRNA for TIMPs, and (3) reducing the amount of collagen mRNA. With the Ad-AST and Ad-BAT treatments, we have been able to tip the maturation of the vein graft toward positive remodeling (artery-like phenotype) or toward negative remodeling (fibroproliferation and stenosis), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is most commonly the cause of graft occlusion in infrainguinal bypass grafting for arterial occlusive disease. We investigated the influence of nitric oxide on the IH of the arterial vessel wall at the region of prosthetic bypass anastomoses.\nExperiments were performed in 10 Foxhound dogs. We used a technique of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) overexpression by a non-virus-mediated, liposome-based iNOS gene transfer. The plasmid pSCMV-iNOS, which drives the expression of iNOS under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was complexed with cationic liposomes (lipoplexes). Segments of both carotid arteries were pretreated by intramural injection of a lipoplex solution by using an infiltrator balloon catheter (Infiltrator Drug Delivery Balloon System). In each dog, iNOS was administered at one side, and a control vector (pSCMV2) was administered at the contralateral side. Carotid arteries were ligated, and bypass grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, 6-mm, ring enforced) were implanted on both sides. The proximal and distal anastomoses (end-to-side fashion; running nonabsorbable sutures) were placed in the pretreated regions. After 6 months, the prostheses were excised, and the intimal thicknesses of 50 cross sections (orcein staining) of each anastomosis were measured planimetrically.\nThe average reduction of the neointima thickness of the iNOS side in proximal anastomoses at the prosthetic wall, suture region, and arterial wall was 43%, 52%, and 81%, respectively. In distal anastomoses, the average reduction was 40%, 47%, and 52%, respectively. All differences of neointima thickness between the iNOS and control sides were statistically significant (Wilcoxon test; P < or = .05).\nInducible NOS expression is an efficient approach for inhibition of IH. In contrast to earlier studies, which investigated the efficacy of gene therapeutic NOS expression at 3 to 4 weeks after intervention, the novelty of our findings is that a single local lipoplex-mediated transfection of the vascular wall with iNOS-expressing plasmids leads to a reduction of IH in a prosthetic in vivo model even after 6 months. Because all components can be manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions (the quality-management system of the European pharmaceutical industry based on ISO 9000), this approach is also amenable to human therapy.",

    "abstract": "To characterize temporal changes in mouse aortic wall gene expression associated with the development of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nC57BL/6 mice underwent transient perfusion of the abdominal aorta with either elastase (n = 61) or heat-inactivated elastase as a control (n = 68). Triplicate samples of radiolabeled aortic wall complementary DNA were prepared at intervals of 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days, followed by hybridization to nylon microarrays (1181 genes). Autoradiographic intensity data were normalized by conversion to z scores, and differences in gene expression were defined by two-tailed z tests at a significance threshold of P < .01.\nElastase perfusion caused a progressive increase in aortic diameter up to 14 days accompanied by transmural inflammation and destructive remodeling of the elastic media. No aneurysms occurred in the control group. Compared with healthy aorta, 336 genes exhibited significant alterations during at least 1 interval after elastase perfusion (135 at more than 1 interval and 14 at all intervals), with pronounced increases for interleukin 6, cyclin E2, interleukin 1beta, osteopontin, CD14/lipopolysaccharide receptor, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, and gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase 9 (all >20-fold on day 3). Sixty-two genes exhibited synchronous alterations in the elastase and control groups, thus suggesting a nonspecific response. By direct comparisons between the elastase and control groups, there were 384 genes with significant differences in expression for at least 1 interval after aortic perfusion, including 234 with differential upregulation (eg, p44MAPK/ERK1, osteopontin, heat shock protein 84, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, apolipoprotein E, monocyte chemotactic protein 3, MIG (monokine induced by gamma interferon), and interleukin 2 receptor gamma) and 163 with differential downregulation (eg, prothrombin, granzyme B, ataxia telangiectasia mutated, and interleukin-converting enzyme).\nDevelopment of elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms in mice is accompanied by altered aortic wall expression of genes associated with acute and chronic inflammation, matrix degradation, and vascular tissue remodeling. Knowledge of these alterations will facilitate further studies on the functional molecular mechanisms that underlie aneurysmal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Clinical dextrans, such as Dextran 40 and Dextran 70, are associated with anaphylactoid reactions caused by dextran-reactive immunoglobulin G antibodies. When infused immediately before clinical dextrans, dextran 1 significantly reduces the incidence of severe anaphylactoid reactions. The objective of the study was to describe the frequency and characteristics of reports submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid events after clinical dextran administration.\nWe searched the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System for reports associated with a clinical dextran and describing anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions. Our case definition for a probable anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid event required signs or symptoms from at least two body systems, with at least one sign or symptom being hypotension, vasodilation, or respiratory difficulty, and onset within 60 minutes. Other reports were considered possible cases if the reporter specifically described the reaction as anaphylaxis or an anaphylactoid reaction. Premier RxMarket Advisor provided estimates of total US hospitalizations with clinical dextran or dextran 1 administration from 2000 to 2004, based on discharge billing data from a sample of US hospitals. The IMS National Sales Perspective provided estimates of total doses of dextrans sold in the United States from 1999 to 2004, based on volumes of dextrans sold in a sample of retail and nonretail outlets.\nThe FDA received 366 clinical dextran adverse event reports from 1969 to 2004, of which 90 (24.6%) were anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid events. The ratio of hospitalizations where clinical dextran was administered to hospitalizations where dextran 1 was administered was 28.4:1. The expected ratio would be 1:1 if all clinical dextran patients had received dextran 1 pretreatment. The ratio of clinical dextran doses sold to dextran 1 doses sold in the United States was 38.6:1.\nA high proportion of adverse event reports for clinical dextrans described anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions. Hospital discharge and product sales data suggest that dextran 1 has not been used consistently before clinical dextran administration in recent years. To reduce the risk of anaphylactoid reactions, physicians should consider routine administration of dextran 1 before the infusion of a clinical dextran.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that exemplary surgical care involves a surgeon's involvement in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative periods. In an era of ever-expanding therapeutic modalities available to the vascular surgeon, it is important that trainees gain experience in preoperative decision-making and how this affects a patient's operative and postoperative course. The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the continuity of care they are able to provide for patients and the factors affecting this experience.\nThis prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and conducted at the University of British Columbia during January 2005. All patients who underwent a vascular procedure at either of the two teaching hospitals were included. In addition to type of case (emergent, outpatient, inpatient), resident demographic data and involvement in each patient's care (preoperative assessment, postoperative daily assessment, and follow-up clinic assessment) were recorded. Categoric data were analyzed with the chi2 test.\nThe study included 159 cases, of which 65% were elective same-day admission patients, 20% were elective previously admitted patients; and 15% were emergent. The overall rate of preoperative assessment was 67%, involvement in the decision to operate, 17%; postoperative assessment on the ward, 79%; and patient follow-up in clinic, 3%. The rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (assessing patient pre-op and post-op) was 57%. Emergent cases were associated with a significantly higher rate of preoperative assessment (92% vs 63%, P < .05). For elective cases admitted before the day of surgery compared with same-day admission patients, the rates of preoperative assessment (78% vs 58%, P < .05) and involvement in the decision to operate (16% vs 4%, P < .05) were significantly higher.\nThe continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the safety of percutaneous endovascular procedures (PEPs) during integration of endovascular skills into an urban academic vascular surgery practice and assess the hypothesis that currently accepted guidelines are a valid benchmark for endovascular competency.\nFrom 2000 through 2004, an endovascular training paradigm was instituted to integrate endovascular procedures into an academic endovascular practice. The paradigm involved individual mentoring of vascular surgery faculty by a partner with mature endovascular skills. Mentoring continued until each surgeon achieved a procedural experience of 100 diagnostic angiograms and 50 percutaneous endovascular interventions. Once achieved, privileges were granted for independent endovascular practice. To assess the effectiveness of the training process and competency of the newly trained endovascular practitioner, the surgeon-specific 30-day incidence of major complications and deaths for all PEPs performed during and after the mentoring process was determined. Complications and deaths were assigned to the mentor during the training process and to the individual surgeon once endovascular privileges were granted. Complications were classified as local vascular, local nonvascular, or systemic/remote.\nFrom 2000 through 2004, 1208 PEPs were performed. During this time, three faculty surgeons achieved sufficient endovascular procedural experience and were granted endovascular privileges. Major complications consisted of 17 local vascular, three local nonvascular, and four systemic/remote. Three deaths occurred. Renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stent procedures had the highest complication and death rate at 9%. The major complication and death rate per year was 1.8% to 4.9% (P = .32) and did not significantly vary. The major complication and death rate for all 1208 PEPs was 2.2%. The surgeon-specific complication and death rate was 1.9% to 3.6% (P = .14) and did not vary between surgeons.\nEndovascular skills can be safely transferred using a vascular surgeon-based training paradigm. When the training paradigm is directed at satisfying currently recommended guidelines for endovascular privileging, competent endovascular surgeons are the result.",

    "abstract": "Buttock claudication due to stenosis or occlusion of the superior gluteal artery is infrequent. The recent development of noninvasive gluteal duplex scanning, combined with aortoiliac angiography using oblique projections and the availability of low-profile devices for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), led us to review our recent experience concerning the diagnosis and mid-term results of PTA for superior gluteal artery stenosis or occlusion.\nThe files of all patients who had been treated in our department by PTA for superior gluteal artery stenosis or occlusion with buttock claudication were analyzed retrospectively, and any associated arterial lesions, morbidity, restenosis, or recurrent buttock claudication were noted. Outcomes were compared with published reports.\nRetrospective review identified six patients (5 men, 1 woman; mean age, 64 years) with seven cases of buttock claudication (1 bilateral localization) who had undergone PTA within the past 2 years. There was no case of isolated buttock claudication. Buttock claudication was associated with impotence, thigh claudication, or calf claudication in seven cases. Gluteal duplex scans were performed for three of the patients diagnosed with two stenoses and one occlusion. Aortoiliac angiography revealed five superior gluteal artery stenoses and two occlusions. PTA without stenting was successful in all cases, without morbidity or mortality. During a mean follow-up of 13 months, restenosis occurred in one patient. A repeat PTA without stenting was successful, with resolution of the buttock claudication.\nButtock claudication due to superior gluteal artery stenosis is probably underestimated when gluteal duplex scanning and aortoiliac angiography with oblique projections are not performed. PTA gives good results, and the procedure can be repeated should restenosis occur.",

    "abstract": "The treadmill exercise test is the most important examination of the functional ability of patients with intermittent claudication or leg pain during exercise, but it does not provide any metabolic information in the calf muscle. The purpose of this study was to investigate the high-energy metabolism in the calf muscle during incremental progressive plantar flexion exercise of a selected peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patient group.\nUsing a 1.5-T whole-body magnetic resonance scanner, 17 male patients with PAD who had 1 symptomatic and 1 asymptomatic leg and 9 healthy male controls underwent serial phosphor 31 (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy during incremental exercise at 2, 3, 4, and 5 W. Furthermore, magnetic resonance angiography was performed, and the ankle-brachial pressure index was determined in the patient group. The runoff resistance (ROR) was separately assessed in each patient's leg.\nThe symptomatic legs exhibited significantly increased phosphocreatine (PCr) time constants during the first three workload increments (2-4 W) and the recovery phase compared with the asymptomatic legs and the normal controls. Only two symptomatic legs reached the last increment at 5 W. Compared with the normal controls, the asymptomatic legs showed significantly increased PCr time constants only at 5 W. In the patient group, we detected significant correlations between the PCr time constants and the ROR, as well as the ankle-brachial pressure index. Moreover, the symptomatic legs presented significantly lower PCr levels and pH values at the end of exercise compared with the asymptomatic and control legs.\nOur study shows that muscle function in PAD patients can be objectively quantified with the help of 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and correlates significantly with hemodynamic parameters such as ROR and ankle-brachial pressure index. Consequently, 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy seems to be a useful method to monitor the muscle function of PAD patients for evaluation of established therapies or new therapeutic strategies during research trials.",

Twelve patients (27.3%) underwent diagnostic angiography, 32 (72.2%) received interventional treatment, 22 (68.8%) received balloon angioplasty, and 10 (31.2%) required stent placement.\nTen (31.3%) of the treated patients developed restenosis within 6 months.

Outcome event rates were assessed by logistic regression analysis, proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier estimations.\nPostoperative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 7.5; P = .001), stroke (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.4; P = .001), and combined stroke and mortality rates (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.0 to 5.8; P < .001) were significantly higher for simultaneous CEA/CABG than for isolated CEA. Ipsilateral postoperative stroke rates were similar (2.6% vs 1.7%, P = .41) in both settings. Vein patching had a lower risk for ipsilateral stroke (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86; P = .015) than primary closure, but was not significantly different from synthetic patching (P = .10). The documented incidence of postoperative carotid thrombosis was 1.5% with primary closure, 0.6% with vein patching, and 2.0% with synthetic patching (P = .088). Overall Kaplan-Meier survival was 92% at 1 year, 71% at 5 years, 41% at 10 years, and 20% at 15 years, but long-term mortality rates were higher after simultaneous CEA/CABG (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5; P = .002) than after CEA alone. Late strokes or retinal infarctions have been reported after 97 (5.0%) of the 1923 operations for which follow-up was available, 51 (2.3%) of which were ipsilateral to CEA. The incidence of > or = 60% recurrent stenosis was independently influenced by carotid patching (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92; P = .019) but not by the choice of patch material (P = .11).\nThese results substantiate the common observation that patients who require simultaneous CEA/CABG have a higher risk for adverse outcomes than patients who undergo isolated CEA. Carotid patching provided significant benefit with respect to the risks for ipsilateral postoperative stroke and > or = 60% recurrent stenosis.",

    "abstract": "The role of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) in the treatment of asymptomatic patients with carotid disease remains controversial. The purpose of this report is to compare outcomes in asymptomatic patients treated with CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This was the initial experience performing CAS for most of the surgeons. For comparison, we also report our outcomes in standard-risk patients treated concurrently with CEA during the same period of time.\nA retrospective, nonrandomized review of asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA or CAS at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis was done. Patients with >70% asymptomatic carotid stenosis treated between September 2003 and April 2005 were identified. CEA was the first therapeutic consideration in all patients. CAS was reserved for high-risk patients. Thirty-day outcomes of stroke or death were recorded. During this time interval, 248 patients were treated including with 93 CAS and with 145 CEA. Symptomatic or clinically detected adverse outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, renal failure, or pulmonary complications were noted but were not the primary end points of this review. This study addresses only the periprocedural outcomes of CEA and CAS in asymptomatic patients. No data >30-day follow-up are included.\nDuring this period, 93 CAS and 145 CEA procedures were done in asymptomatic patients. Patient characteristics in both groups were similar. Carotid protection devices were used in 91.4% of CAS patients. The results in the CAS group showed one death (1.1%) and one stroke (1.1%). In the CEA group, three strokes occurred (2.1%, P = 0.9999), one associated with death (0.7%, P = 0.9999). The CAS group had 1.34 +/- 0.83 risk factors vs 0.39 +/- 0.58 in the CEA group (P < .0001). Median CAS and CEA length of stay was 1 day.\nCAS for asymptomatic carotid stenosis demonstrated equivalent outcomes compared with CEA, despite CAS being reserved for use in a disadvantaged subset of high-risk patients owing to anatomic risk factors or medical comorbidities. These results suggest CAS should be considered a reasonable treatment option in the high-risk but asymptomatic patient. Enthusiasm for CAS should be tempered by the recognition that long-term outcomes in CAS-treated asymptomatic patients remain unknown.",

    "abstract": "Interruption of antegrade cerebral perfusion results in transient neurologic intolerance in some patients undergoing carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study sought to evaluate factors that contributed to the development of cerebral ischemia during PercuSurge balloon occlusion and techniques used to allow successful completion of the CAS procedure.\nThe PercuSurge occlusion balloon was used in 43 of 165 patients treated with CAS for high-grade stenosis (mean stenosis, 90%). All 43 patients were at increased risk for endarterectomy (7 restenosis, 3 irradiation, 3 contralateral occlusion, and 30 Goldman class II-III); 20% were symptomatic. Symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion during temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery occurred in 10 of 43 and included dysarthria (7/10), agitation (6/10), decreased level of consciousness (5/10), and focal hemispheric deficit (3/10). An incomplete circle of Willis or contralateral carotid artery occlusion, or both, was present in 8 of 10 patients. Symptoms resulting from PercuSurge balloon occlusion were managed by balloon deflation with or without evacuation of blood from the internal carotid artery using the Export catheter. All symptoms resolved completely without deficit after deflation of the occlusion balloon.\nThe development of neurologic symptoms after initial PercuSurge balloon inflation and occluded internal carotid artery flow was associated with a decrease in the mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) from 15 to 10 (range, 9 to 14); the GCS returned to normal after occlusion balloon deflation and remained normal during subsequent reinflation. The mean time to spontaneous recovery of full neurologic function was 8 minutes (range, 4 to 15 minutes). No thrombotic or embolic events were present on cerebral angiography or computed tomography scan. Balloon reinflation was performed after a mean reperfusion interval of 10 minutes after full neurologic recovery (range, 4 to 20 minutes). The mean subsequent procedure duration was 11.9 minutes (range, 6 to 21 minutes). No recurrence of neurologic symptoms occurred when the occlusion balloon was reinflated. All 10 patients underwent successful CAS without occlusion, dissection, cerebrovascular accident, or death.\nSeveral factors may contribute to the development of neurologic intolerance during CAS with balloon occlusion. Elucidation of the protective cellular mechanisms that invoke ischemic tolerance after the initial transient ischemic event may enable CAS with embolic protection in patients who cannot tolerate initial interruption of antegrade cerebral perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Ligation and bypass is the most commonly performed surgical treatment for popliteal artery aneurysm. This approach can be complicated by persistent collateral flow to the excluded aneurysm sac, which may lead to aneurysm growth, the development of compressive symptoms, and in some cases, rupture. Repair of popliteal aneurysms by posterior endoaneurysmorrhaphy and reconstruction with a short prosthetic interposition graft avoids these complications because patent collaterals communicating with the aneurysm sac are oversewn at the time of surgery. We report the early and mid-term outcomes of popliteal artery aneurysm repair using this posterior approach.\nThe records of all patients operated on for popliteal artery aneurysm from December 1981 to June 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent popliteal artery aneurysm repair with a posterior approach were included in the study.\nFrom 1981 to 2003, 30 popliteal aneurysms (mean diameter, 3.2 cm; range, 1.9 to 6.2 cm) were repaired in 24 patients using a posterior approach with interposition prosthetic grafting. The median follow up was 21.5 months. Primary patency, primary assisted patency, and secondary patency were 92.2%, 95.8%, and 95.8%, respectively, at 1 and 2 years. The limb salvage rate was 100%.\nPopliteal endoaneurysmorrhaphy using a posterior approach with interposition prosthetic grafting is simple, safe, and effective. The patency and limb salvage rates are equivalent to those obtained with ligation and vein bypass. In addition, the posterior approach eliminates the postoperative complications associated with persistent collateral flow into the aneurysm sac.",

We studied whether it can provide information useful for the diagnosis and treatment of arterial vascular disease.\nBlood was obtained from 429 vascular patients admitted consecutively during September 2004 to March 2005. The APC-PCI complex was measured by using a sandwich immunofluorometric method. The patients were divided into cohorts according to the planned treatment and compared with a control group of healthy individuals.\nThe APC-PCI complex concentration varied from 0.08 to 2.50 microg/L. In the cohort of patients with aortic aneurysms (n = 78), the median APC-PCI value was 0.45 (10th to 90th percentile, 0.24-1.47), and values were clearly increased compared with all other cohorts (P < .0001). Patients with carotid disease (n = 73) yielded a median of 0.22 (10th to 90th percentile, 0.15-0.48). The median for claudicants (n = 74) was 0.26 microg/L (10th to 90th percentile, 0.15-0.75), which was higher than in those (n = 97) with critical ischemia (0.20; 10th to 90th percentile, 0.13-0.36; P < .0023).

Patients with aortic aneurysm had a threefold higher median concentration than the control group. We suggest that this remarkable increase is caused by the local activation of coagulation, and we surmise that APC-PCI measurements can be used as a screening tool to identify patients with aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Research on surgical outcomes has focused on technical results and physical morbidity. However, postoperative psychiatric complications are common and can undermine functional results. High rates of posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder have been documented after cardiac events or surgery. These complications are also expected after abdominal aortic surgery, but their incidence and relevant risk factors in this population have not been documented.\nWe examined the development of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms in patients with aortic aneurysms or occlusive disease, comparing surgical with nonsurgical patients and predicting that surgery and a prolonged intensive care stay would contribute to the development of psychiatric morbidity. A consecutive sample of vascular surgery patients (n = 109) was recruited 6 months to 2 years after surgery. Data were analyzed by using group comparisons, regression, and path analyses.\nRates of objectively determined postoperative psychiatric morbidity were extremely high (32%). Surgical patients were more than four times more likely to develop psychiatric disorders (odds ratio, 4.8; P = .02). Being younger, having increased preoperative blood pressure, and being intubated at the end of surgery were linked to greater rates of psychiatric morbidity (P < .05), but a longer intensive care stay was not.\nNew-onset psychiatric symptoms are common after abdominal aortic surgery, and preoperative and surgical factors were more predictive than postoperative complications and stress, as reflected in intensive care unit stays. Prospective examination of vulnerability in this model could identify risk factors for stress-related psychiatric morbidity and help improve surgical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Few large series document surgical outcomes for patients with pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (PAAAs), defined as aneurysms including the juxtarenal aorta or renal artery origins that require suprarenal aortic clamping. No standard endovascular alternatives presently exist; however, future endovascular branch graft repairs ultimately must be compared with the gold standard of open repair. To this end, we present a 10-year experience.\nBetween 1993 and 2003, 3058 AAAs were repaired. Perioperative variables, morbidity, and mortality were retrospectively assessed. Renal insufficiency was defined as a rise in the concentration of serum creatinine by > or = 0.5 mg/dL. Factors predicting complications were identified by multivariate analyses. Morbidity and 30-day mortality were evaluated with multiple logistic regression analysis.\nOf a total of 3058 AAA repairs performed, 247 were PAAAs (8%). Mean renal ischemia time was 23 minutes (range, 5 to 60 minutes). Cardiac complications occurred in 32 patients (13%), pulmonary complications in 38 (16%), and renal insufficiency in 54 (22%). Multivariate analysis associated myocardial infarction with advanced age (P = .01) and abnormal preoperative serum creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL) (P = .08). Pulmonary complications were associated with advanced age (P = .03), renal artery bypass (P = .02), increased mesenteric ischemic time (P = .01), suprarenal aneurysm repair (P < .0008), and left renal vein division (P = .01). Renal insufficiency was associated with increased mesenteric ischemic time (P = .001), supravisceral clamping (P = .04), left renal vein division (P = .04), and renal artery bypass (P = .0002), but not renal artery reimplantation or endarterectomy. New dialysis was required in 3.7% (9/242). Abnormal preoperative serum creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL) was predictive of the need for postoperative dialysis (10% vs 2%; P = .04). Patients with normal preoperative renal function had improved recovery (93% vs 36%; P = .0002). The 30-day surgical mortality was 2.5% (6/247) but was not predicted by any factors, and in-hospital mortality was 2.8% (7/247). Median intensive care and hospital stays were 3 and 9 days, respectively, and longer stays were associated with age at surgery (P = .007 and P = .0002, respectively) and any postoperative complication.\nPAAA repair can be performed with low mortality. Renal insufficiency is the most frequent complication, but avoiding renal artery bypass, prolonged mesenteric ischemia time, or left renal vein transection may improve results.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair has proven to be an effective treatment for many abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Aneurysms that require open repair have usually been disqualified from an endovascular approach as a result of a variety of anatomic constraints, which may also make open repair more difficult. Our purpose was to review open AAA repair and assess the complexity of the operative procedure and associated morbidity and mortality data in the era of endovascular stent grafting.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records of 606 patients undergoing elective open AAA repair at a single tertiary care community hospital from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2004. Patients with ruptured aneurysms and all endovascular repairs were excluded. Patients were grouped into two categories. Group 1 included 301 patients who underwent open repair before the initiation of an endovascular stent grafting program in November 1999. Group 2 included 305 patients who underwent open repair after the initiation of the stent graft program. Operative reports were reviewed to determine the location of the proximal aortic cross clamp, management of the renal vein, associated iliac aneurysmal or occlusive disease, and type of surgical reconstruction. Morbidity, mortality, and disposition data were compared for the two groups and subjected to chi2 analysis.\nSuprarenal aortic cross-clamp placement was required in 6% of group 1 patients and 20% of group 2 patients (P < .05). Division of the renal vein was necessary in 11% of group 1 patients and 18% of group 2 patients (P < .05). Iliac aneurysms were present in 25% of group 1 patients and 42% of group 2 patients (P < .05). The incidence of associated iliac occlusive disease was 12% in group 1 and 20% in group 2 (P < .05). The type of reconstruction required (aortoaorto, aortoiliac, aortofemoral) was not found to be statistically significant. All major sources of morbidity, including renal insufficiency, myocardial infarction, stroke, and intubation times, were similar between the two groups. The length of stay was 9.2 days in both groups, and 11.3% of group 1 patients and 26% of group 2 patients were discharged to an extended-care facility rather than directly home. The overall mortality rate was 2.0% for patients in group 1 and 3.8% for group 2 patients. This was not a statistically significant difference.\nSurgeons performing open repair of AAA in the era of endovascular stent grafting are operating on patients who require more complex repairs, including a greater frequency of suprarenal cross clamping, renal vein division, and management of associated iliac aneurysmal and occlusive disease. Despite this, morbidity and mortality rates are similar to those in patients operated on before the initiation of an endovascular stent grafting program.",

    "abstract": "Women are usually not considered for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening because of their lower prevalence of disease. This position may, however, be questioned given the higher risk of rupture and the longer life expectancy among women. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening 65-year-old women for AAA.\nA systematic review of the literature was conducted to obtain data of importance to evaluate the effectiveness of screening women for AAA. Data were entered into a Markov simulation cohort model.\nThe review suggested some main assumptions for women with AAA. Prevalence is 1.1%. In 6.8%, the AAA is of a size that merits surgery, and the patients are fit for a procedure. For patients with an AAA, the yearly risk for elective surgery and the rupture incidence was 3.1% and 2.4%, respectively, in the invited group and 1.1% and 5.7% in the noninvited group. The operative mortality for elective surgery was 3.5%, and the total mortality for ruptured AAA was 86.3%. The long-term mortality for AAA patients was 3.6 times higher than for an age-matched healthy population. Screening reduced the AAA rupture incidence by 33% and the AAA-related death rate by 35%. The cost per life year gained was estimated at $5911.\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was similar to that found for screening men, which reflects the fact that the lower AAA prevalence in women is balanced by a higher rupture rate.

    "abstract": "Endograft limb extension to the external iliac artery with embolization of an internal iliac artery (IIA) may be necessary in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) extending to the common iliac artery to prevent endoleak during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Coil embolization of the IIA can be performed at the same operative setting as EVAR or, alternatively, as a staged procedure. Most interventionalists favor the latter approach to avoid excessive contrast material and prolonged operative time. We investigated the clinical outcome of concomitant vs staged unilateral IIA embolization in the setting of EVAR.\nVascular surgeons at our institution treated 24 patients with infrarenal EVAR and unilateral coil embolization of the IIA from October 1, 2000 to June 30, 2005. All patients had normal renal function. The details of the operative procedure and perioperative complications were compared in patients undergoing concomitant vs staged procedures. Follow up was 1 to 40 months (average, 11 months).\nAmong the 24, 16 underwent concomitant unilateral IIA embolization in the setting of EVAR and eight patients underwent the staged procedure. Average duration of operative time (298 vs 284 minutes), amount of intravenous contrast (215 mL vs 164 mL), and preoperative (1.12 vs 1.26 mg/dL), and postoperative (1.15 v. 1.31 mg/dl) creatinine levels were similar in the concomitant vs staged group, respectively (P > .05 for all factors). More sensitive markers of renal insufficiency such as creatinine clearance were not measured. In the concomitant group, 25% (4/16) of patients reported significant symptoms of buttock claudication ipsilateral to the embolized IIA, which resolved after a mean of 8.8 months (range, 1 to 15 months) vs no cases (0/8) in the staged group (P = .02048). One patient in the staged group developed ischemic colitis, which was treated conservatively. Coil embolizations that were performed as staged procedures were all done on an outpatient basis. All 24 patients were admitted the day of the EVAR and were discharged the next day, except one patient in the concomitant group was discharged the second day after the procedure, and one patient in the staged group was discharged 7 days after the procedure.\nDespite concern of prolonged operative time and the amount of contrast needed to perform concomitant IIA embolization and EVAR, our results showed that in patients with normal renal function, concomitant unilateral IIA embolization in the setting of EVAR was safe and effective and associated with shorter hospitalization compared with staged procedures. The disadvantage of a concomitant procedure is an increased likelihood of transient buttock claudication, but the small number of patients in this series prohibits definite conclusions about this complication. The concomitant procedure may be preferable for infirm patients with normal renal function who would be greatly inconvenienced by two procedures.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the need for secondary interventions after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with current stent-grafts.\nStudied were data from 2846 patients treated from December 1999 until December 2004. The data were recorded from the EUROSTAR registry. The only patients studied were those with a follow-up of at least 12 months or until they had a secondary intervention within the first 12 months. The cumulative incidences of secondary transabdominal, extra-anatomic, and transfemoral interventions during follow-up (after the first postoperative month) were investigated.\nA secondary intervention was performed in 247 patients (8.7%) at a mean of 12 months after the initial procedure within a follow-up period of a mean of 23 +/- 12 months. Of these, 57 (23%) transabdominal, 43 (16%) involved an extra-anatomic bypass, and 147 (60%) were by transfemoral approach. The cumulative incidence of secondary interventions was 6.0%, 8.7%, 12%, and 14% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. This corresponded with an annual rate of secondary interventions of 4.6%, which was remarkably lower than in a previously published EUROSTAR study of patients treated before 1999. Type I endoleaks (33% of procedures), migration (16%), and rupture (8.8%) were the most frequent reasons for secondary transabdominal interventions. Graft limb thrombosis was the indication for extra-anatomic bypass (60%). Type I endoleak (17%), type II endoleak (23%), device limb stenosis (14%), thrombosis (23%), and device migration (14%) were the most frequent reasons for secondary transfemoral interventions. Operative mortality was higher after secondary transabdominal interventions (12.3%, P = .007) compared with transfemoral interventions (2.7%). Overall survival was lower in patients with secondary transabdominal (P = .016) and extra-anatomic interventions (P < .0001) compared with patients without a secondary intervention.\nAlthough the incidence of secondary interventions after endovascular aneurysm repair has substantially decreased in recent years, continuing need for surveillance for device-related complications remains necessary.",

    "results": "A secondary intervention was performed in 247 patients (8.7%) at a mean of 12 months after the initial procedure within a follow-up period of a mean of 23 +/- 12 months. Of these, 57 (23%) transabdominal, 43 (16%) involved an extra-anatomic bypass, and 147 (60%) were by transfemoral approach. The cumulative incidence of secondary interventions was 6.0%, 8.7%, 12%, and 14% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. This corresponded with an annual rate of secondary interventions of 4.6%, which was remarkably lower than in a previously published EUROSTAR study of patients treated before 1999. Type I endoleaks (33% of procedures), migration (16%), and rupture (8.8%) were the most frequent reasons for secondary transabdominal interventions. Graft limb thrombosis was the indication for extra-anatomic bypass (60%). Type I endoleak (17%), type II endoleak (23%), device limb stenosis (14%), thrombosis (23%), and device migration (14%) were the most frequent reasons for secondary transfemoral interventions. Operative mortality was higher after secondary transabdominal interventions (12.3%, P = .007) compared with transfemoral interventions (2.7%). Overall survival was lower in patients with secondary transabdominal (P = .016) and extra-anatomic interventions (P < .0001) compared with patients without a secondary intervention.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports have raised concern about the percentage of enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) after endovascular repair with the Gore Excluder device. As part of the investigation into this issue, a morphologic analysis was performed on enlarging aneurysms in the Excluder Pivotal clinical trial.\nComputed tomographic scans were evaluated on all patients identified with enlarging aneurysms (5-mm increase by Core laboratory or site) and at least 4 years of follow-up in the Excluder Pivotal clinical trial. Three-dimensional reconstruction, a set of 24 standard morphologic measurements, and analysis of potential enlargement mechanisms were performed.\nOf 112 trial patients with 4 years of follow-up, 38 AAAs (34%) were identified as enlarging. Data were obtained from 196 computed tomographic scans (the mean interval was 47 months from first to last scan). Of the 158 scans with a prior scan for comparison, 41% demonstrated growth relative to the initial scan by diameter criteria, but 79% demonstrated growth relative to the initial scan by 3-dimensional volume criteria (P < .0001 vs diameter; chi2 analysis). This difference was most evident at early time points: at 1 year, diameter criteria indicated that 8% of these AAAs were enlarging, but 56% were already enlarging by volume criteria. On average, enlargement was detected by volume 18 months before it was detected by diameter (P < .0001), and at a smaller diameter (55 +/- 1 mm vs 60 +/- 1 mm; P < .0001). Only 19% of scans (39% of patients) had apparent endoleaks. Scans with apparent endoleaks demonstrated a greater interval rate of growth as compared with those without apparent endoleak (3.6 +/- 0.8 mm vs 1.9 +/- 0.3 mm [P < .02] by diameter; 23 +/- 4 cm3 vs 11 +/- 1 cm3 [P < .001] by volume). Although the etiology of enlargement may be endotension or device permeability in up to 74% of patients, other potential causes of aneurysm enlargement included neck apposition length less than 15 mm (15 patients; 39%), large aortic diameter relative to device (18%), large iliac diameter (5%), and iliac apposition length less than 15 mm (20%). Multiple potential etiologies of enlargement were present in 53% of AAAs.\nThe etiology of aneurysm enlargement in the Excluder Pivotal trial is likely multifactorial, including endoleak, inadequate attachment site length, and endotension or device permeability. Even by conservative criteria, a substantial percentage of aneurysm growth with the original device is likely due to material permeability. Three-dimensional volume criteria detected aneurysm enlargement more frequently, at a smaller diameter, and on average 18 months sooner than standard diameter criteria, thus suggesting a role in further investigation of this issue.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the use of novel technology to treat complex aortic aneurysms involving branches that provide critical end-organ blood supply.\nA prospective study was conducted in patients with thoracoabdominal, suprarenal, or common iliac aneurysms (TAA, SRA, or CIA) at high risk for open surgical repair. An endovascular graft using the Zenith platform was customized to fit patient anatomy (TAA or SRA) and combined with Jomed balloon-expandable stent-grafts. Prefabricated hypogastric branches were used with a Zenith abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or Fluency self-expanding fenestrated device in conjunction with a self-expanding stent-graft. Analyses were conducted in accordance with the endovascular aneurysm reporting standards document. Follow-up studies occurred at discharge, 1, 6, and 12 months, and included computed tomography and duplex ultrasound scans, and flat plate radiography.\nFifty patients were treated (9 TAA, 20 SRA, 21 CIA). The mean aneurysm size was 7.6 cm (TAA), 7.2 cm (SRA), and 6.1 cm AAA size associated with a mean CIA size of 3.8 cm. Bilateral CIA aneurysms were present in 86% (18/21) of patients with CIA aneurysms. Perioperative mortality was 2% (1/50) and resulted from a myocardial infarction after a planned conduit and iliac endarterectomy required for device access. Five late deaths occurred (2 TAA, 2 SRA, 1 CIA), three of which (2 TAA, 1 SRA) were aneurysm related. Failure to access internal iliac arteries occurred in three cases, and two late hypogastric branch thromboses occurred. No visceral branches were lost acutely or occluded during follow-up. Sac shrinkage (>5 mm) was noted in 65% of patients at 6 months and in all patients (10/10) by 12 months. There were no ruptures or conversions, but nine patients required secondary interventions.\nBranch vessel technology has made it technically feasible to preserve critical end-organ perfusion in the setting of CIA, SRA, and TAA aneurysms. The relatively low acute mortality rate and lack of short-term branch vessel loss are encouraging and merit further investigation. These advances have the potential to markedly diminish the complications associated with conventional management of complex aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to Chlamydia pneumoniae is extremely common, and its incidence increases with age. C pneumoniae infection is strongly associated with coronary artery disease, as well as with atherosclerosis of the carotid artery, aorta, and peripheral arteries. This association has been shown in seroepidemiologic studies and by direct detection of the organism in atherosclerotic lesions by immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, electron microscopy, and tissue culture. Animal models of atherosclerosis have been used to study the role of C pneumoniae in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic disease. The association of this organism with cardiovascular complications has inspired many human trials of antibiotics for the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis. C pneumoniae can infect several types of cells, including circulating macrophages, arterial smooth muscle cells, and vascular endothelial cells, causing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and procoagulants by endothelial cells and foam cell formation by infected macrophages. This report reviews the role of C pneumoniae in atherogenesis in light of recent, large antibiotic treatment trials, animal studies, and in vitro studies. The role of Chlamydia heat shock protein as a potential mediator of this harmful effect is also reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The acute technical failure of endovascular treatment of chronic total occlusions (CTOs) is most often due to the inability to re-enter the true lumen after occlusion is crossed in a subintimal plane. This study reports our initial experience with true lumen re-entry devices in the treatment of CTOs.\nPatients with treatment of CTOs were identified from our vascular registry. All patients in whom the Pioneer catheter or the Outback catheter were used were also identified from a prospectively maintained separate database of cases in which true lumen re-entry devices were used. We used procedural data from the prospective database and reviewed the medical records. Lesion character and location, access type, location of true lumen re-entry, stent usage, procedural times, and complications, were tabulated.\nFrom August 2003 to December 2004, endovascular techniques were used to treat 87 CTOs in 58 iliac and 29 superficial femoral arteries. In 24 (26%), the true lumen could not be re-entered by using standard catheter and wire techniques. The true lumen was not initially re-entered in 20 (34%) of 58 of treated iliac CTOs and four (13%) of 29 of treated superficial femoral artery CTOs (73% TASC C and D lesions). Intravascular ultrasound-guided true lumen re-entry using the Pioneer catheter (21 CTOs), or fluoroscopic-guided true lumen re-entry using the Outback catheter (3 CTOs) was successful in achieving true lumen re-entry in all cases at the location desired. Total time of re-entry catheter manipulation required to achieve re-entry was <10 minutes and was routinely accomplished in <3 minutes. All occlusions were stented. No cases were converted to open repair. Bleeding from the recanalization and angioplasty site occurred in four patients (15%). It was controlled with use of covered stents in two cases, and resolved after placement of uncovered stents in the other two. No significant bleeding occurred at the sites of true lumen re-entry needle deployment. All occlusions treated with true lumen re-entry devices remain clinically patent at a mean follow-up of 5.8 months.\nEndovascular treatment of chronic total occlusions is often limited by the inability to re-enter the true lumen after subintimal crossing of the occluded segment. This occurs more commonly with treatment of iliac occlusions than in superficial femoral artery occlusions. True lumen re-entry catheters are very effective at gaining wire passage back to the true lumen and facilitating successful endovascular treatment of chronic total occlusions that would otherwise require open bypass.",

In 24 (26%), the true lumen could not be re-entered by using standard catheter and wire techniques. The true lumen was not initially re-entered in 20 (34%) of 58 of treated iliac CTOs and four (13%) of 29 of treated superficial femoral artery CTOs (73% TASC C and D lesions). Intravascular ultrasound-guided true lumen re-entry using the Pioneer catheter (21 CTOs), or fluoroscopic-guided true lumen re-entry using the Outback catheter (3 CTOs) was successful in achieving true lumen re-entry in all cases at the location desired. Total time of re-entry catheter manipulation required to achieve re-entry was <10 minutes and was routinely accomplished in <3 minutes. All occlusions were stented. No cases were converted to open repair. Bleeding from the recanalization and angioplasty site occurred in four patients (15%). It was controlled with use of covered stents in two cases, and resolved after placement of uncovered stents in the other two. No significant bleeding occurred at the sites of true lumen re-entry needle deployment. All occlusions treated with true lumen re-entry devices remain clinically patent at a mean follow-up of 5.8 months.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of patients suffer from peripheral artery disease (PAD). Current therapies are often limited by the extent of vascular pathology and the occurrence of restenosis after angioplasty. The stimulatory effect of growth factor administration on collateral vessel formation (arteriogenesis) has evolved as a potential new treatment for this patient group. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was shown to stimulate arteriogenesis in small-animal models and in a pilot study in patients with coronary artery disease. Although a recent clinical study demonstrated disappointing results after subcutaneous GM-CSF application in patients with PAD, we hypothesized that intra-arterial cytokine application using implantable infusion pumps might well stimulate arteriogenesis in a large-species model of peripheral vascular disease. We also aimed to compare continuous and intermittent infusion regimens and to validate experimental and clinically available measurements of collateral artery growth.\nTwenty-four pigs underwent unilateral occlusion of the right femoral artery and received either GM-CSF continuously, GM-CSF intermittently, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After 1 week, collateral conductance was determined under maximal vasodilatation with adenosine and by using a pump-driven extracorporal shunt system.\nConductance showed a significant stimulatory effect of GM-CSF on arteriogenesis (collateral conductance [mL/min/mm Hg]: PBS, 37.7 +/- 5.4; GM-CSF continuous, 69.2 +/- 12.5; GM-CSF intermittent, 71.5 +/- 11.1). Flow measurements under reactive hyperemia were consistent with these results (flow occluded/non-occluded hind limb: PBS, 40.5% +/- 9.1%; GM-CSF continuous, 48.9% +/- 3.9%; GM-CSF intermittent, 48.7% +/- 4.4%). Measurements of ankle/brachial indices were not sensitive enough to detect the differences in collateral growth between the three groups.\nThese results demonstrate the proarteriogenic properties of GM-CSF in larger animal species, revealing comparable efficacy of continuous and intermittent intra-arterial infusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence that implantable pumps offer a possible means for the intra-arterial application of growth factors. Intra-arterial application of GM-CSF might be a future treatment option for vascular occlusive disease. Finally, we show that in the peripheral circulation, pressure measurements alone have a low sensitivity to determine the effects of proarteriogenic therapy compared with flow or combined flow-pressure measurements.",

    "abstract": "We examined the protective effects of the new selective spinal cord cooling by using cold saline infusion into the cross-clamped aorta and a transvertebral cooling pad placed over the lumbar vertebral column from paraplegia caused by ischemic spinal cord injury on thoracoabdominal aortic surgery.\nEighteen rabbits were divided into three groups: groups I, II, and III (n = 6 for each group). In group I (37 degrees C; 5 mL) and group II (3 degrees C; 5 mL), saline was infused into the isolated aortic segment twice, at 0 and 5 minutes after aortic cross clamping. In group III, a 3 degrees C saline solution plus cooling pads placed just after cross clamping were combined. The infrarenal aorta was then isolated proximally and distally by vascular clamps for 12 minutes. In our preliminary study, only the abdominal aorta just distal to the left renal artery was clamped. At 48 hours after reperfusion, the groups clamped for 12 and 15 minutes were all paraplegic. The time of clamping the aorta was set at 12 minutes as the critical point when paraplegia occurred upon simple clamping of the infrarenal aorta only. The spinal cord temperature was monitored at the L4 level continuously during the procedures in all three groups. At 8, 24, and 48 hours after the operation, hind limb function was estimated by using the Tarlov score, which is often used for evaluating motor function in animals. A histopathologic study using hematoxylin and eosin stains was also performed.\nAt 48 hours after the operation, the Tarlov scores in groups I, II, and III were 0 +/- 0, 2.0 +/- 1.9, and 4.0 +/- 0 (mean +/- SD), respectively. The Tarlov score and histopathologic analysis in group III were significantly superior to those of groups I (P < .01) and II (P < .05). The spinal cord temperature in groups II and III decreased by -1.8 degrees C and -4.3 degrees C at its minimum. The rabbits in group III were also protected from paraplegia.\nSelective spinal cord cooling with cold saline infusion into the isolated aortic segment and transvertebral regional cooling can reduce the neurologic damage of spinal cord ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Rho kinase plays an important role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contraction and other cellular functions, such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that long-term inhibition of Rho kinase suppresses coronary artery spasm and vascular lesion formation after arterial injury. In the cardiovascular surgery field, intimal thickening in vein grafts is the major cause of late graft failure, for which no effective treatment has yet been developed. In this study, we examined whether long-term inhibition of Rho kinase suppresses intimal thickening in autologous vein grafts in rabbits.\nMale rabbits were randomly divided into two groups and received normal chow (control group) or a special chow containing 0.09% fasudil (fasudil group). After oral administration, fasudil is metabolized to a specific Rho kinase inhibitor, hydroxyfasudil. Each group underwent reversed autologous vein graft surgery with the internal jugular vein into the left common carotid artery. At 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the operation, we examined the extent of intimal thickening of the graft and VSMC proliferation and apoptosis.\nThe intimal thickening was significantly suppressed in the fasudil group compared with the control group at 2 and 4 weeks after the operation. In the fasudil group, VSMC proliferation was suppressed at 1 and 2 weeks after the operation, whereas VSMC apoptosis was enhanced at 2 weeks after the procedure.\nThese results indicate that Rho kinase is substantially involved in the pathogenesis of intimal thickening of vein grafts and that it is an important therapeutic target for the prevention of graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Chylous ascites is the accumulation of triglyceride-rich, free, milk-like peritoneal fluid caused by the presence of intestinal lymph in the abdominal cavity. Primary chylous ascites is uncommon. We present our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.\nTwelve patients (7 adults, 5 children) affected by primary chylous ascites were studied. Diagnostic investigations included abdominal sonography scans, lymphoscintigraphy, and lymphography combined with computed tomography (CT) with intravenous and intralymphatic lipid-soluble contrast, and laparoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging was used when lymphography and lymphatic CT were not able to define the dysplasia well, or in the presence of lymphatic dilatation. Surgical treatment included laparoscopy (12/12), drainage of ascites (12/12), the search for and treatment of abdominal and retroperitoneal chylous leaks (12/12), exeresis of lymphodysplastic tissues (12/12), ligation of incompetent lymph vessels (9/12), carbon dioxide laser treatment (cut and welding effects) of the dilated lymph vessels using an operating microscope for magnification (9/12), and chylovenous and lymphovenous microsurgical shunts (7/12).\nEight patients did not have a relapse of the ascites, and three patients had a persistence of a small quantity of ascites with no protein imbalance. Postoperative lymphoscintigraphy in seven patients confirmed better lymph flow and less lymph reflux. Median follow-up was 5 years (range, 3 to 7 years). We observed early relapse of chylous ascites in only one case that required a peritoneal-jugular shunt and led to good outcome.\nPrimary chylous ascites is closely correlated to lymphatic-lymphonodal dysplasia that does not involve a single visceral district alone. Medical preoperative treatment played an essential role in the global management of this complex pathology. We demonstrated that the use of laparoscopy is remarkably advantageous for confirming diagnosis, for draining the ascites, and for evaluating the extension of the dysplasia. Our diagnostic work-up provided us with an exact diagnostic assessment and allowed us to plan a precise surgical approach.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical predictors associated with long-term thrombotic recurrences necessitating surgical intervention after initial success with nonoperative management of patients with primary subclavian vein thrombosis.\nSixty-four patients treated for Paget-Schroetter syndrome from 1996 to 2005 at our institution were reviewed. The standardized protocol for treatment includes catheter-directed thrombolysis, a short period of anticoagulation, and selective surgical decompression for patients with persistent symptoms. First-rib resection was performed in 29 patients (45%) within the first 3 months, with a success rate of 93%. The remaining 35 patients (55%) were treated nonoperatively and constitute this study's population.\nOf the 35 patients with successful nonoperative management, 8 (23%) developed recurrent thrombotic events of the same extremity at a mean follow-up time of 13 months after thrombolysis (range, 6-33 months). These eight patients subsequently underwent first-rib resection with a 100% success rate without further sequelae at a mean follow-up time of 51 months (range, 2-103 months). The other 27 patients remained symptom free at a mean follow-up interval of 55 months (range, 10-110 months). Bivariate analyses determined that the use of a stent during the initial thrombolysis was associated with thrombotic recurrence (P = .05). The recurrence group was also significantly younger than the asymptomatic group (22 vs 36 years; P = .01). Sex, being a competitive athlete, a history of trauma, whether the dominant arm was affected, time of delay to lysis, initial clot burden, response to original lysis, use of adjunctive balloons or mechanical thrombectomy devices, residual stenosis on venography, length of time on warfarin, and patency of the vein on follow-up duplex examination were all characteristics not associated with long-term recurrence after nonoperative management.\nConservative nonoperative management of primary subclavian vein thrombosis can be successfully used with acceptable long-term results. A younger age (<28 years old) and the use of a stent during initial thrombolysis are factors associated with long-term recurrent thrombosis. Younger patients should be offered early surgical decompression, and the use of stents without thoracic outlet decompression is not indicated.",

The mean follow-up time was 5 years. The patients were evaluated by interview, clinical examination, computerized strain-gauge plethysmography, and color duplex ultrasound imaging. The grade of post-thrombotic syndrome was rated according to the Villalta score (0 to 3 on each of four subjective and five clinically assessed features).\nThe rate of venous emptying was significantly lower in the arms with DVTs than in the contralateral arms (P < .001). Eleven of the patients (35%) had a remaining outflow obstruction in the affected arm (venous emptying <68 mL/100 mL per min). Eighteen (58%) had a residual thrombus according to color duplex ultrasound scans, with four remaining occluded subclavian veins. None of the patients had deep or superficial venous reflux. There was no statistically significant relationship between plethysmographic and duplex findings. Most (77%) of the patients reported remaining symptoms in the affected arm, and there was a significant side difference in upper arm circumference (P < .001). Approximately one third had developed a moderate grade of post-thrombotic syndrome according to the Villalta score (total, 5 to 9). No significant relation was evident between the post-thrombotic syndrome score and duplex findings. Patients with post-thrombotic syndrome had a lower venous emptying value than those without (69 vs 84 mL/100 mL per min), but this difference was not statistically significant.\nPatients with conservatively treated previous primary UEDVT had significantly reduced venous outflow capacity and a residual thrombus was common. Swelling of the arm was the most common symptom, and one third had a moderate grade of post-thrombotic syndrome. However, there was no clear relation between hemodynamic and morphologic factors and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome in these 31 patients, examined at a mean of 5 years after an acute DVT episode.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a second-generation long-duration temporary caval filter in these situations and compare its utility with that of other temporary filters.\nThis prospective study, including patients who underwent temporary caval filtration with the Tempofilter II, was conducted in nine European centers. All filters were successfully implanted. The filter was removed when the indication for caval filtration ceased.\nA total of 104 filters were inserted in 103 patients with an average age of 60 +/- 15.5 years (range, 22-92 years). Most patients (85%) had pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, or both. The main indications for caval filter placement were complications of or contraindications to anticoagulation therapy (n = 85; 82.5%) or for ineffectiveness of anticoagulation therapy (n = 12; 11.7%). The average duration of implantation was 29.5 +/- 14.0 days (range, 2-86 days). One filter migrated in the right atrium, followed by pulmonary embolism. No other case of pulmonary embolism or of infectious or mechanical complications related to the filter was observed. Thrombus was trapped within the filter in 24 cases (23.3%). All filters but one were removed, regardless of whether thrombus had been trapped. Retrieval was always successful after implantation periods up to 12 weeks. In 16 cases (15.5%), the filter was replaced by a permanent filter.\nThe Tempofilter II is safe, effective, and useful in critical thromboembolic situations.

The average duration of implantation was 29.5 +/- 14.0 days (range, 2-86 days). One filter migrated in the right atrium, followed by pulmonary embolism. No other case of pulmonary embolism or of infectious or mechanical complications related to the filter was observed. Thrombus was trapped within the filter in 24 cases (23.3%). All filters but one were removed, regardless of whether thrombus had been trapped. Retrieval was always successful after implantation periods up to 12 weeks. In 16 cases (15.5%), the filter was replaced by a permanent filter.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous access-related ischemia is an uncommon but serious and occasionally devastating complication. Distal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) has been established as a standard treatment procedure; however, an axial artery is ligated and the distal perfusion is maintained by the construction of an arterial bypass. Because such an approach, in principle, appears undesirable, we developed and applied an alternative technique referred to as proximalization of the arterial inflow (PAI). This procedure converts the arterial supply of the arteriovenous access to a more proximal artery with higher capacity by using a small-caliber polytetrafluoroethylene graft as a feeder.\nFrom January 1999 to June 2005, the PAI technique was applied in 30 patients. The indication was seen in patients with severe distal ischemia who had a flow volume rate of <800 mL/min in a native fistula and <1000 mL/min in prosthetic access.\nPain was the dominant symptom of ischemia in most patients before surgery. In 37%, a tissue loss was observed. The symptoms of access-related ischemia disappeared completely in 84% of patients and improved significantly in 16%. The significant hemodynamic improvement was confirmed by an increase of the intraoperatively measured mean distal arterial pressure from 32 +/- 9 mm Hg to 63 +/- 8 mm Hg. The digital-brachial index increased from 0.40 +/- 0.10 to 0.83 +/- 0.07. The mean access flow rate was 658 +/- 80 mL/min after PAI and did not differ significantly with the preoperative value (634 +/- 181 mL/min). With a mean follow-up interval of 26.1 +/-19.1 months, the primary and secondary patency rates were, respectively, 87% and 90% at 1 year and 67% and 78% at 3 years.\nThe PAI procedure represents a well-suited alternative to the DRIL technique for the treatment of patients who develop ischemia after creation of an arteriovenous access. Results for access salvage and disappearance of ischemic symptoms are equivalent to the DRIL technique. In contrast to the DRIL procedure, the PAI technique preserves the natural arterial pathway. Hence, PAI is preferable for surgeons who are reluctant to ligate an axial artery and are concerned about potentially disastrous consequences.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection has become the initial treatment of choice for femoral access-related pseudoaneurysms. Patients typically undergo serial duplex examinations to assess for spontaneous resolution of small iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms (IPSAs) (<2.5 cm), or may require repeated diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up studies for larger IPSAs (>2.5 cm). We evaluated the impact of a revised treatment algorithm that includes primary treatment of both small (<2.5 cm) and larger pseudoaneurysms (>2.5 cm), rather than observation of smaller ones, and attempts to establish a single duplex examination via a point-of-care treatment strategy.\nWe reviewed 105 consecutive patients treated with ultrasound-guided thrombin injection from July 2001 through September 2004. Patient, IPSAs, characteristics, and treatment methods were examined. The number of duplex examinations per patient was evaluated over the treatment interval. Also, published cost data were used to compare primary treatment of small ISPAs vs observation with serial duplex examinations.\nSuccessful thrombosis occurred in 103 (98.1%) of 105 treated pseudoaneurysms. No minor or major complications occurred after thrombin injection in either small or large ISPAs, and both failures requiring operation were in the large aneurysm group. The recurrence rate for the series was 1.9% (2/105), and both recurrences were successfully treated with an additional thrombin injection. A single injection was successful in treating 43 (97.7%) of 44 small (<2.5 cm) IPSAs, and one required a second injection. Patients had an average of 3.3 duplex examinations in our first year of treatment experience, which declined to 1.5 by our third year with the institution of a point-of-care service model for all pseudoaneurysms. Based on this decreased use of duplex examination and an average treatment cohort of 35 IPSA patients per year our institution, we determined this results in a reduction of 35 hours of laboratory time and nearly 70 ultrasounds per year. Similarly for small pseudoaneurysms, a point-of-service primary treatment program rather than observation results in an estimated cost savings of $12,000, based on treating 15 small IPSAs per year.\nUltrasound-guided thrombin injection is safe and effective for the treatment of nearly all iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms. We recommend primary treatment of small pseudoaneurysms by ultrasound-guided thrombin injection rather than observation with serial duplex scans. A point-of-care treatment algorithm can result in cost savings by reducing the number of necessary duplex examinations.",

    "abstract": "Our group and others have previously established that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are significantly undertreated with respect to overall cardiovascular risk factor management, despite national guidelines to the contrary. In an effort to maximize risk factor control in our patients with PAD, we established a pharmacist-managed, physician-monitored algorithmic approach to the outpatient management of lipids in patients with PAD. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of this service on lipid screening and control in patients with PAD.\nWe analyzed the records of patients treated at a large, group-model, not-for-profit regional managed care system serving approximately 405,000 members. An electronic medical record provided full examination, laboratory, and pharmacy data for all patients. Pharmacy data were analyzed to determine prescriptions for lipid-lowering agents. Lipid control was assessed through fasting lipid data. Patients with validated PAD and the absence of clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) were offered the service between May 2003 and September 2004 and followed up for a minimum of 6 months.\nWe administratively identified 5159 active patients with a diagnosis of PAD. Of these, 1075 could be validated with a noninvasive arterial study. The exclusion of 384 patients with a diagnosis of CAD resulted in a cohort of 691 patients. Of these, 90 patients were enrolled in the lipid service (study group), and 601 received standard care. Mean follow-up was 17.1 months. Screening fasting lipid profiles were found in 95.6% (86/90) of patients in the study group and only 66.9% (402/601) of the standard care patients (P < .0001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control was improved in the pharmacist-managed group, with 79.1% (68/86) achieving an LDL-C of less than 100 mg/dL in comparison to the standard care group (54.8% [219/400]; P < .0001). An LDL-C value of more than 130 mg/dL was noted in 1.2% and 14.0% (56/400) in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P < .001). Statin use was present in 51.9% (312/601) of the control group patients and 84.4% (76/90) of the pharmacist-managed group (P < .001).\nDespite national consensus of PAD as a CAD equivalent, patients are currently undertreated with regard to atherosclerotic risk factor modification. Initiation of a pharmacist-managed, physician-monitored lipid service provides improved compliance with national guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Our objectives were to determine whether obesity is associated with a greater functional decline compared with the ideal body mass index (BMI) among persons with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to determine the associations between weight gain and loss and functional declines in PAD. We hypothesized that baseline obesity and weight gain during follow-up would each be associated with functional declines in persons with PAD.\nThe design was a prospective cohort study. The subjects were 389 men and women with PAD (mean ankle-brachial index, 0.65 +/- 0.14) who were followed up prospectively for a median of 48 months. The main outcome measures were functional assessments (6-minute walk, usual- and rapid-paced 4-m walking speed, and summary performance score). Weight and height were measured at baseline and annually. Results were adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidities, ankle-brachial index, education, leg symptoms, exercise status, depressive symptoms, pack-years of cigarette smoking, prior-year functioning, and patterns of missing data.\nCompared with those with a baseline BMI between 20 and 25 kg/m2, PAD participants with baseline BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 had a significantly greater average annual decline in 6-minute walk performance (-13.1 vs -26.5 m/y; P = .004), usual-paced 4-m walking velocity (-0.028 vs -0.055 m/s per year; P = .024), and fast-paced 4-m walking velocity (-0.053 vs -0.086 m/s per year; P = .012). Persons with weight gain between 5 and 10 pounds after baseline who walked for exercise regularly had significantly less decline in the 6-minute walk than persons without significant weight change who did not walk for exercise (P = .04).\nObesity is associated with functional decline in persons with PAD. Walking exercise may protect against functional decline in PAD persons with modest weight gain.",

Patients were assessed on metabolic syndrome characteristics, PAD-specific measures consisting of ankle/brachial index and claudication distances, physical function measures, health-related quality of life, and calf blood flow and transcutaneous oxygen tension responses after 3 minutes of vascular occlusion.\nInitial claudication distance (mean +/- SD) was 29% shorter (P = .018) in patients with metabolic syndrome than in the controls (128 +/- 121 meters vs 180 +/- 166 meters), and absolute claudication distance was 22% shorter (P = .025) in those with metabolic syndrome (319 +/- 195 meters vs 409 +/- 255 meters). Furthermore, patients with metabolic syndrome had lower peak oxygen uptake (P = .037), a shorter 6-minute walk distance (P = .027), lower values on six domains of health-related quality of life (P < .05), reduced calf hyperemia (P = .028), and greater calf ischemia (P < .001) after vascular occlusion. In the group with metabolic syndrome, calf ischemia was correlated with initial claudication distance (r = 0.30, P = .004), absolute claudication distance (r = 0.40, P < .001), and peak oxygen uptake (r = 0.52, P < .001).\nMetabolic syndrome worsens intermittent claudication, physical function, health-related quality of life, and peripheral circulation in patients with PAD. Calf ischemia in those with metabolic syndrome was predictive of intermittent claudication and physical function. The additive burden of metabolic syndrome thus places patients who are limited by intermittent claudication at an even greater risk for living a functionally dependent lifestyle. Aggressive risk-factor modification designed to treat components of metabolic syndrome should be evaluated for efficacy in modifying physical and vascular function in patients with intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "To examine wound healing and the functional natural history of patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass with reversed saphenous vein for critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nConsecutive patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass for CLI were retrospectively entered into a technical and functional outcomes database. The patients were enrolled from the tertiary referral vascular surgery practices at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and Southern Illinois University Medical School. Main outcome variables included wound healing, self-assessed degree of ambulation (outdoors, indoors only, or nonambulatory), and living status (community or structured) after a mean follow up of 30 +/- 23 months. These outcome variables were assessed relative to the preoperative clinical characteristics (symptom duration before vascular consultation, lesion severity, and serum albumin level) and graft patency.\nFrom August 1997 through December 2004, 334 patients (253 men; median age, 68 years) underwent 409 infrainguinal bypasses (157 popliteal, 235 tibial, and 17 pedal) for CLI (159 Fontaine III and 250 Fontaine IV). Perioperative mortality was 1.2%. At 1 and 3 years, respectively, the primary patency was 63% and 50%, assisted primary patency was 80% and 70%, limb salvage was 85% and 79%, and survival was 89% and 74%. Complete wound healing at 6 and 12 months was 42% and 75%, respectively. Thirty-four patients (10%) died before all wounds were healed. Multivariate analysis indicated that extensive pedal necrosis at presentation independently predicted delayed wound healing (P < or = .01). At baseline (defined as the level of function within 30 days before the onset of CLI), 91% of patients were ambulatory outdoors, and this decreased to 72% at 6 months (P < or = .01). Similarly, 96% of patients lived independently at baseline, and this decreased to 91% at 6 months (P < or = .01) Graft patency was associated with better ambulatory status at 6 months. A longer duration of symptoms before vascular consultation was associated with a worse living status at 6 months.\nDespite achieving the anticipated graft patency and limb salvage results, 25% of patients did not realize wound healing at 1 year of follow-up, 19% had lost ambulatory function, and 5% had lost independent living status. Prospective natural history studies are needed to further define the functional outcomes and their predictors after infrainguinal bypass for CLI.",

    "abstract": "To determine the perioperative mortality, myocardial infarction rate, and long-term survival of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) compared with those with intermittent claudication (IC) within a cohort selected for significant coronary artery disease, a secondary analysis was conducted of a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) before peripheral vascular surgery. This multicenter trial was sponsored by the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nOf the 510 patients enrolled in the CARP trial and randomized to coronary revascularization or no revascularization before elective vascular surgery, 143 had CLI and 164 had IC as an indication for lower limb revascularization; >95% of each group were men. The presence of coronary artery disease was determined by cardiac catheterization. Eligible patients had at least one treatable coronary lesion of > or =70%. Those with significant left main disease, ejection fraction of <20%, and aortic stenosis were excluded. Patients were randomized to coronary artery disease revascularization or no revascularization before vascular surgery and followed for mortality and morbidity perioperatively and for a median of 2.7 years postoperatively. Medical treatment of coronary artery disease was pursued aggressively.\nPatients with IC had a longer time from randomization to vascular surgery (p = .001) and more abdominal operations (p < .001). Patients with CLI had more urgent operations (p = .006), reoperations (p < .001), and limb loss (p = .008) as well as longer hospital stays (p < .001). The IC group had more perioperative myocardial infarctions (CLI, 8.4%; IC, 17.1%; p = .024), although perioperative mortality was similar (CLI, 3.5%; IC, 1.8%; p = .360). In follow-up, the IC group also had numerically more myocardial infarctions (CLI, 16.8%; IC, 25%; p = .079), but mortality was not different (CLI, 21%; IC, 22%; p = .825). Coronary artery revascularization did not lower perioperative or long-term mortality in either group.\nOur data indicate that patients with significant coronary artery disease and either CLI or IC can undergo vascular surgery with low mortality and morbidity, and these results are not improved by coronary artery revascularization before vascular surgery. Furthermore, when selected for the presence of symptomatically stable, severe coronary artery disease, there is no difference in long-term survival between patients with CLI and IC. Finally, the better-than-predicted outcomes for these patients with advanced systemic atherosclerosis may be due to aggressive medical management with beta-blockers, statins, and acetylsalicylic acid.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical outcome in patients treated for aortic graft infections with in situ reconstruction (ISR). As a secondary aim, the outcomes were compared between patients who had similar clinical characteristics and extent of infection, needed total graft excision, and had either ISR or axillofemoral reconstruction (AXFR).\n117 consecutive patients treated for aortic graft infection over a 20 year period from January 1981 to December 2001 were identified. 52 patients had prosthetic ISR, 49 had AXFR, and 16 had other reconstructions. The ISR patients treated with total (n = 35) or partial (n = 17) graft excision comprised the primary analysis. A second analysis was done between 34 ISR and 43 AXFR patients (non-concurrent groups), as stated above. Primary outcome measures were early and late procedure-related death, primary graft patency and limb loss. Secondary outcomes were operative morbidity, patient survival, and graft reinfection rates.\nThere were 40 males and 12 females with a mean age of 69 years treated with ISR. 43 patients had Rifampin-soaked grafts and 39 had omental flap or other autogenous coverage. Operative morbidity occurred in 23 patients (44%). There were 4 early and no late procedure-related deaths after a median follow up of 3.4 years (range, 2 months to 9.6 years). Primary patency and limb salvage rates at 5 years were 89% and 100%, respectively. Graft reinfection occurred in 6 patients (11.5%) and was not associated with procedure-related death. In the comparative analysis, the procedure-related death rate for patients treated with ISR was not different than those treated with AXFR (9% versus 23%; P = 0.11). There was a significant improvement in primary patency between ISR and AXFR at 5 years (89% versus 48%; P = .01). Limb salvage was 100% for ISR and 89% for AXFR at 5 years (P = .06). The incidence of graft reinfection was similar in both groups: 11% for ISR and 17% for AXFR (P = .28). Major complications or procedure-related deaths occurred in 12 patients after ISR (30%) and 26 patients (60%) after AXFR (P < .04).\nISR is a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of select patients with aortic graft infection. Graft reinfection occurred in 11.5% of the patients. The graft patency and limb salvages rates are excellent.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to assess the influence of previous contralateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and of the timing of the procedures on cerebral clamping ischemia during the second operation in patients undergoing staged bilateral CEA.\nWe reviewed the 251 patients who presented with bilateral carotid stenosis of > or =70% at the time of the first admission and underwent staged bilateral CEA between January 2001 and December 2004. Surgery was performed under locoregional anesthesia. Cerebral perfusion was monitored with mental status and contralateral motor function evaluation in awake patients. Selective carotid shunting was performed for patients who manifested neurologic deficits. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the variables of interest.\nTwenty-two patients (8.8%) required carotid shunting during the first procedure and 28 (11.1%) during the second one. Nine of the latter also had shunts during the first CEA, whereas 19 tolerated cross-clamping during the first operation. Among the patients who underwent contralateral CEA < or =30 days, 23 of 146 required carotid shunting; between 31 and 60 days, 4 of 73; and after 61 days, 1 of 32 (P = .023; univariate analysis). The chi2 for trend was statistically significant (P = .009). Patients operated on the second side < or =30 days had a nearly fourfold risk of shunting during the second procedure compared with patients operated on > or =31 days. The highest risk was observed in patients with a shunt during the first operation who underwent the second CEA < or =30 days. Multivariate analysis also identified the time intervals between CEAs and the need of shunting during the first procedure as independent risk factors (P = .042 and P < .001).\nThese data show an increased incidence of cerebral clamping ischemia during contralateral endarterectomy performed < or =30 days; whereas after longer intervals between CEAs, the need for shunting is significantly reduced.",

The best treatment for secondary prophylaxis in vertebrobasilar occlusive disease has not been defined. In patients with high-grade stenoses, and especially those refractory to medication, stenting offers the chance to restore normal flow and prevent major strokes.\nWe provide data regarding outcome and complications on 20 consecutive patients who underwent vertebrobasilar stenting at our institution (9 V0, 2V3, 5 V4, and 4 basilar artery lesions). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on >600 cases of vertebrobasilar stenting, including all published cases up to 2005.\nPrimary interventional success was achieved in all cases, with a mean residual stenosis of 3% +/- 4% in V0, 5% +/- 4% in V3/4, and 7% +/- 3% in basilar artery lesions. No peri-interventional neurologic complications and no transient ischemic attack or stroke at follow-up were noted in patients with vertebral ostial lesions, whereas two transient and three permanent clinical deteriorations occurred in patients with V4 or basilar artery lesions, some of which had presented with acute stroke. Patency rate was 100% at the last examination. According to published data on proximal vertebral artery stenting, mortality is 0.3%, the rate of neurologic complications is 5.5%, and the risk of posterior stroke at follow-up is 0.7%. Interventions for distal vertebral or basilar artery disease carry a 3.2% mortality risk, a 17.3% risk for neurologic complications and a 2% risk for stroke at follow-up.\nStenting of the vertebral origin can be performed safely and with a low rate of cerebral ischemic events at follow-up, although restenosis may occur. Larger comparative trials are needed. Treatment decisions in distal vertebrobasilar disease have been made on an individual basis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the late results in adult patients who underwent surgery of the abdominal aorta as children.\nDuring a 17-year period, eight children underwent surgery for lesions of the abdominal aorta. There were 6 boys and 2 girls, with an average age of 10 years. The presenting symptom that led to diagnosis of abdominal aortic lesions was hypertension in five cases and lower-limb claudication in three. The underlying disease was middle aortic syndrome in three cases, infrarenal aortic hypoplasia in two, infrarenal aortic aneurysm in two, and Takayasu's disease in one. Five children had associated renal artery lesions, including four with bilateral lesions and one with a unilateral lesion. Aortic bypass was used in all cases. A straight tube graft was placed between the distal descending thoracic or supraceliac aorta and the infrarenal aorta in six cases, and a bifurcated bypass was placed between the infrarenal aorta and the iliac arteries in two. Renal artery revascularization procedures (n = 9) included ex vivo repair with renal autotransplantation in five cases, direct reimplantation on the arch of Riolan in two, and direct reimplantation of the renal artery onto the aortic graft in two.\nOne patient died on postoperative day 1. The remaining seven patients recovered uneventfully. Mean follow-up was 10.2 years. No patient was lost to follow-up. Further surgical intervention was required in three patients. The indications for additional surgery were fibrosis of a renal artery reimplanted onto the graft at 3 years, deterioration of the aortoaortic graft at 5 years, and false iliac aneurysm at 20 years. All seven patients had normal physical development. The average increase in height and weight were 28.5 cm and 26.2 kg, respectively. All patients had normal sexual function, and two are parents. All patients are currently asymptomatic. Short Form 36 scores for quality-of-life parameters were 78% to 83%.\nLate results of abdominal aortic surgery in children, in our experience, are encouraging. Quality of life in adulthood was excellent. Insofar as possible, correction should be deferred until the child is 8 to 10 years old so that a prosthesis of sufficient diameter can be used.",

    "abstract": "Secure proximal fixation of endografts to the infrarenal aortic neck is known to be important in the short- and long-term success of endovascular aneurysm repair. We sought to determine the relative importance of distal iliac fixation in preventing endograft migration and adverse clinical events after endovascular aneurysm repair.\nWe reviewed the outcome of 173 patients treated from 1996 to 2003 at Stanford University Medical Center with an externally supported stent graft. Quantitative image analysis of the postimplantation computed tomography scan was performed to determine the proximal aortic and distal iliac fixation lengths and the proximity the distal end of the stent graft to the iliac bifurcation. Subsequent follow-up computed tomography scans were reviewed for evidence of stent graft migration. Patients were grouped according to good (>15 mm), intermediate, or bad (<10 mm) aortic fixation and good (iliac fixation length > or =25 mm and iliac limbs <10 mm from iliac bifurcation), intermediate, or bad (<25-mm fixation length) iliac fixation.\nStent graft migration of 10 mm or more was seen in 17 patients (10%) during the 23 +/- 19-month follow-up period. Patients with no migration had a greater iliac fixation length (30 +/- 12 mm) than those with migration (22 +/- 8 mm; P = .01), and the distal ends of the iliac limbs were closer to the iliac bifurcation (15 +/- 12 mm) than in patients with migration (25 +/- 10 mm; P < .001). Patients with no migration also had a greater proximal aortic fixation length (23 +/- 12 mm) than migration patients (13 +/- 7 mm; P = .001). There were no migrations among patients with good iliac fixation whether aortic fixation was good, intermediate, or bad (0/63; 0%). Among patients with bad/intermediate iliac and good aortic fixation, there were 5 (9%) of 58 patients had migrations. Patients with both bad/intermediate iliac and bad/intermediate aortic fixation had the highest migration rate (12/52; 23%). Cox proportional hazards regression modeling revealed that the significant factors predicting migration were poor proximity of the distal end of the iliac limbs to the iliac bifurcation (odds ratio 17.2; P = .01) and aortic fixation length (odds ratio 2.0; p = 0.007 for each centimeter). Iliac extender modules were placed in 9 patients with bad iliac fixation and migration, with no further migration during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Patients with good iliac and aortic fixation and no endoleak on the initial postprocedure computed tomography scan (n = 43) had no migrations, secondary procedures, or adverse clinical events over a 2-year follow-up period.\nIliac fixation, along with proximal aortic fixation, is an important factor in preventing the migration of stent grafts that have longitudinal columnar support. Patients with good iliac fixation did not experience migration even in the presence of suboptimal proximal aortic fixation. Close proximity of the distal end of the stent graft to the iliac bifurcation seems to provide stability against migration.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine activation of coagulation in patients undergoing open and endovascular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nIn a prospective, comparative study, 30 consecutive patients undergoing open repair (n = 15) or EVAR (n = 15) were investigated. Blood samples to determine fibrinopeptide A, fibrin monomer, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and D-dimer were taken up to 5 days postoperatively. Routine hematologic and hematochemical parameters as well as clinical data were collected.\nBoth groups showed comparable demographic variables. Operating time was longer in open repair (249 +/- 77 minutes vs 186 +/- 69 minutes, P < .05). Perioperatively elevated markers of coagulation were measured in both groups. Fibrinopeptide A levels did not differ significantly between the groups (P = .55). The levels of fibrin monomer and thrombin-antithrombin complex were significantly higher in patients undergoing EVAR (P < .0001), reflecting increased thrombin activity and thrombin formation compared with open surgery. The D-dimer level did not differ significantly between the groups. These results were also valid after correction for hemodilution.\nThese data suggest increased procoagulant activity in EVAR compared with open surgery. A procoagulant state may favor possible morbidity derived from micro- and macrovascular thrombosis, such as in myocardial infarction, multiple organ dysfunction, venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.",

Perioperatively elevated markers of coagulation were measured in both groups. Fibrinopeptide A levels did not differ significantly between the groups (P = .55). The levels of fibrin monomer and thrombin-antithrombin complex were significantly higher in patients undergoing EVAR (P < .0001), reflecting increased thrombin activity and thrombin formation compared with open surgery. The D-dimer level did not differ significantly between the groups. These results were also valid after correction for hemodilution.",

    "abstract": "To understand the potential of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in patients presenting with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA), the proportion in whom this procedure was applicable was assessed. Mortality and morbidity was also determined in patients treated with emergency EVAR (eEVAR) when anatomic and hemodynamic conditions allowed (ie, in the entire cohort with patients receiving endovascular and open repair combined). In addition, a comparison was made between the treatment group with eEVAR and open repair.\nBetween February 2003 and September 2004, 10 participating institutions enrolled a representative sample of 100 consecutive patients in whom eEVAR was considered. Patients in the New Endograft treatment in Ruptured abdominal aortic Aneurysm (ERA) trial were offered eEVAR or open repair in accordance with their clinical condition or anatomic configuration. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal representatives. The study included patients who were treated by stent-graft technique or by open surgery in the case of adverse anatomy for endoluminal stent-grafting or severe hemodynamic instability, or both. Data were collated in a centralized database for analysis. The study was sponsored and supported by Medtronic, and eEVAR was uniquely performed with a Talent aortouniiliac (AUI) system in all patients. Crude and adjusted 30-day or in-hospital and 3-month mortality rates were assessed for the entire group as a whole and the EVAR and open repair category separately. Complication rates were also assessed.\nStent-graft repair was performed in 49 patients and open surgery in 51. No significant differences were observed between these treatment groups with regard to comorbidity at presentation, hemodynamic instability, and the proportion of patients who could be assessed by preoperative computed tomography scanning. Patients with eEVAR more frequently demonstrated a suitable infrarenal neck for endovascular repair, a longer infrarenal neck, and suitable iliac arteries for access than patients with open repair. The primary reason to perform open aneurysm repair was an unfavorable configuration of the neck in 80% of the patients. In patients undergoing eEVAR, operative blood loss was less, intensive care admission time was shorter, and the duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter (P < or = .02, all comparisons). The 30-day or in-hospital mortality was 35% in the eEVAR category, 39% in patients with open repair, and 37% overall. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups with regard to crude mortality rates or rates adjusted for age, gender, hemodynamic shock, and pre-existent pulmonary disease. The cumulative 3-month all-cause mortality was 40% in the eEVAR group and 42% in the open repair group (no significant differences at crude and adjusted comparisons). The 3-month primary complication rate in the two treatment groups was similar at 59%.\nIn approximately half the rAAA patients, eEVAR appeared viable. An unsuitable infrarenal neck was the most frequent cause to select open repair. In dedicated centers using a Talent AUI system, eEVAR appeared to be a feasible method for treatment of a rAAA. The overall first-month mortality did not differ across treatment groups (patients with endovascular and open repair combined), yet was somewhat lower than observed in a recent meta-analysis reporting on open repair.",

    "abstract": "To validate a means by which migration of thoracic stent grafts can be reliably detected and quantified.\nPatients treated for thoracic aneurysms (without dissections) with either the Cook Zenith TX1/TX2 or the Gore TAG device were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with digital imaging data at a baseline study (discharge or 1-month computed tomographic scan) and a minimum of 6 months' follow-up were evaluated on a three-dimensional workstation. Centerline of flow (CLF) calculations were used to determine length measurements to establish distances from native vascular landmarks (left common carotid artery, left common carotid artery, and celiac artery) to the proximal and distal aspects of the fixation systems of stent grafts. Patients with evidence of fixation system migration (>10 mm of movement) or increasing thoracic aortic lengths (left common carotid artery to celiac artery distance) were subjected to more detailed reviews.\nOf 194 patients evaluated (133 Zenith and 61 TAG), 46 were treated for dissections and excluded. Fifty-seven patients did not have a digital baseline study and available DICOM data for follow-up imaging at 6 months or later or had died before such follow-up imaging. The remaining 91 patients underwent assessment for device migration. Analyses were conducted on 19 patients at 6 months, on 42 at 12 months, on 12 at 24 months, on 13 at 36 months, and on 5 at 48 months. CLF analysis noted more than 10 mm of caudal movement of the proximal device in 10 patients and cranial movement of the distal device in 3 patients. When this subset was further scrutinized with regard to morphologic changes remote from the prosthesis and in the context of the overall aortic repair (such as elephant trunk grafts), only four patients had movement of the proximal or distal fixation system with respect to the initially deployed location. Two-dimensional axial image analysis identified migration in only one of the four patients with CLF-detected fixation system movement.\nThe importance of early migration detection cannot be overstated given the potential to avert consequences as evidenced by analyses of counterpart abdominal aortic aneurysm devices. In vivo thoracic device analysis is more complex than that for devices used for infrarenal aneurysms. Distance calculations based on CLF measurements may overestimate the frequency of true migration, yet they serve as a reasonable initial screening tool. The resultant subset of patients then must undergo a more detailed evaluation of device position in the context of the aortic morphology to differentiate true migration from devices that maintain stable fixation system positions.",

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive endovascular treatment of a traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta is a new strategy in the care of multitrauma patients. We report the experience in The Netherlands with endovascular management of patients with acute traumatic ruptures of the thoracic aorta.\nWe reviewed 28 patients with a traumatic thoracic aortic rupture treated with a thoracic aortic endograft between June 2000 and April 2004. All patients underwent treatment at one of the four participating level 1 trauma centers. Data collected included age, sex, injury severity score, type of endovascular graft, endovascular operation time, length of stay, length of stay in the intensive care unit, and mortality. Follow-up data consisted of computed tomographic angiography and plain chest radiographs at regular intervals.\nAll patients (mean age, 40.9 years; SD, 18.5 years) experienced severe traumatic injury, and the mean injury severity score was 37.1 (SD, 7.8). All endovascular procedures were technically successful, and the median operating time for the endovascular procedure was 58 minutes (interquartile range, 47-88 minutes). The overall hospital mortality was 14.3% (n = 4), and all deaths were unrelated to the aortic rupture or stent placement. There was no intervention-related mortality during a median follow-up of 26.5 months (interquartile range, 10-34.6 months). Postoperative data showed no severe endovascular graft- or procedure-related morbidity, except for one patient with an asymptomatic collapse of the endovascular graft during regular follow-up. This was corrected by placing a second graft.\nThis study shows that the results of immediate endovascular repair of a traumatic aortic rupture are at least equal to those of conventional open surgical repair. Especially in these multitrauma patients with traumatic ruptures of the thoracic aorta, endovascular therapy seems to be preferable to conventional open surgical repair.",

Previous aortic surgery had been performed in 13 (45%) of 29 and included aortic valve and root replacement in 3, TAA repair in 1, type I repair in 1), type IV repair in 3, type B dissection in 2, infrarenal aneurysm in 5, and right common iliac aneurysm in 1. Severe preoperative comorbidity was present in 23 (80%) of 29: chronic renal impairment in 5, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 6, myocardial disease in 11 at New York Heart Association grade II (6) and grade III (5), and Marfan's syndrome in 6. Twenty-six patients (90%) had a completed procedure. In two patients, myocardial instability prevented completion of the procedure despite extensive preoperative cardiac assessment, and in one, poor flow in the true lumen of a chronic type B dissection prevented anastomosis of the revascularization grafts. Exclusion of the full thoracoabdominal aorta was achieved in all 26 completed procedures and extended to include the iliac arteries in four, with revascularization of coeliac in 26, superior mesenteric artery in 26, left renal artery in 21, and right renal artery in 21).\nThere was no paraplegia < or =30 days or during inpatient admission, and elective and urgent mortality was 13% (3/23). All of the patients with ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysms died < or =30 days. Major complications included prolonged respiratory support (>5 days) in 9, inotropic support in 4, renal impairment requiring temporary support in 2 and not requiring support in 2, prolonged ileus in 2, resolved left hemispheric stroke in 1, and resection of an ischemic left colon in 1. Median blood loss was 3.9 liters (range, 1.2 to 13 liters). The median ischemia time was 15 minutes (range, 13 to 27 minutes) for the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries and 15 minutes for the renal arteries (range, 13 to 21 minutes). The median hospital stay was 27 days (range, 16 to 84 days). Follow-up was a median of 8 months (range, 2 to 31 months), with 92 of 94 grafts patent. Six patients were found to have a type I endoleak. In four, this was a proximal leak, and stent extension in three reduced, but did not cure, the endoleak. One patient with a distal type I endoleak was successfully treated by embolization. Four type II endoleaks resolved without intervention, and one was treated by occlusion coiling of the origin of the left subclavian artery. A single late type III endoleak was found.\nEarly results of visceral hybrid stent-grafts for types I, II, and III thoracoabdominal aneurysms are encouraging, with no paraplegia in this particularly high-risk group of patients. These results have encouraged us to perform the new procedure, in preference to open surgery, in Crawford type I, II, and III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is defined by the clustering in the same person of at least three risk factors such as hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein, hypertension, and abdominal obesity. In patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its relationship with the severity of peripheral circulatory insufficiency, inflammatory status, and cardiovascular comorbidity.\nThe presence of metabolic syndrome was assessed in 154 consecutive PAD patients (115 men, 39 women). Inflammatory status was assessed by measuring serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).\nMetabolic syndrome was present in 51.9% (42.7 % in men, 74.3% in women, P < .01). Patients with an ankle/brachial index (ABI) <0.64 (median) were more likely to have metabolic syndrome than those with less severe PAD (63.9% vs 42.8%, P < .02). The association between a low ABI and metabolic syndrome was maintained after adjustment for age and sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 4.68). Compared with PAD patients without metabolic syndrome, those with the syndrome had greater body mass index (28.2 [25.6; 29.8] kg/m(2) vs 26.1 [24.2; 27.7] kg/m(2), P < .01) and higher levels of CRP (3.9 [1.6; 7.6] mg/L vs 2.0 [1.1; 3.7] mg/L, P < .02). A previous myocardial infarction was documented in 58.2% of patients with and in 37.5% of those without metabolic syndrome (P < .01). At multivariate analysis, metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with previous myocardial infarction also after adjustment for ABI (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.38).\nMetabolic syndrome is present in >50% of PAD patients. The finding that well-established indicators of increased cardiovascular risk such as low ABI and increased CRP levels cluster with metabolic syndrome suggests that identification of this syndrome in these high-risk patients could indicate an even greater risk of cardiovascular events.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the growth and proliferation of blood vessels from existing vascular structures, and therapeutic angiogenesis seeks to promote blood vessel growth to improve tissue perfusion. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prototypic angiogenic agent that exists in vivo in multiple isoforms, and studies with VEGF to date had used single isoform therapy with disappointing results. We tested plasmid and adenoviral vectors encoding a zinc-finger DNA-binding transcription factor (ZFP-32E) that was designed to increase the expression of all major VEGF isoforms in a preclinical model of peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD) in hypercholesterolemic (ApoE knock-out) mice.\nUnilateral femoral artery ligation/excision was performed in 117 mice. At 7 days postoperatively, the ischemic tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles received either ZFP-32E treatment (125 microg of plasmid, 2.5 x 10(11) viral particle units [vpu] of adenovirus; some mice received a second plasmid injection 3 days later) or no-ZFP treatment (125 microg of beta-galactosidase [beta-gal], a plasmid-lacking insert, or an equal dose of adenoviral encoding beta-gal; some mice received a second plasmid injection 3 days later). Group 1 mice (n = 31) were euthanized 3 days later, and VEGF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were measured. Group 2 mice (n = 38) were euthanized 7 days later, and measures of capillary density, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were quantified. Group 3 mice (n = 48) were euthanized 28 days later, and changes in lower limb blood flow perfusion were measured.\nIn group 1, VEGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in those with ZFP-32E treatment vs beta-gal. In group 2, capillary density and proliferating cells were significantly greater and apoptosis was significantly lower in those with ZFP-32E treatment vs beta-gal. Finally, in group 3, changes in the perfusion ratio (ischemic/nonischemic limb) at 21 days after injection were significantly greater in those with ZFP-32E treatment vs no-ZFP treatment.\nThe ability of this engineered zinc-finger VEGF-activating transcription factor to induce therapeutic angiogenesis in hypercholesterolemic mice suggests this approach warrants investigation as a novel approach to treat PAOD.",

    "abstract": "The optimal timing of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) after ipsilateral hemispheric stroke is controversial. Although early studies suggested that an interval of about 6 weeks after a completed stroke was preferred, more recent data have suggested that delaying CEA for this period of time is not necessary. With these issues in mind, we reviewed our experience to examine perioperative outcome with respect to the timing of CEA in previously symptomatic patients.\nA retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all CEAs performed at our institution from 1992 to 2003 showed that 2537 CEA were performed, of which 1,158 (45.6%) were in symptomatic patients. Patients who were operated on emergently <or=48 hours of symptoms for crescendo transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or stroke-in-evolution were excluded from analysis (n = 25). CEA was considered \"early\" if performed <or=4 weeks of symptoms, and \"delayed\" if performed after a minimum of a 4-week interval following the most recent symptom.\nOf nonurgent CEAs in symptomatic patients, in 87 instances the exact time interval from symptoms to surgery could not be precisely determined secondary to the remoteness of the symptoms (>18 months), and these were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 1,046 cases, 62.7% had TIAs and 37.3% had completed strokes as their indication for surgery. Among the entire cohort, patients who underwent early CEA were significantly more likely to experience a perioperative stroke than patients who underwent delayed CEA (5.1% vs 1.6%, P = .002). Patients with TIAs alone were more likely to be operated on early rather than in a delayed fashion (64.3% vs 46.7%, P < .0001), likely reflecting institutional bias in selecting delayed CEA for stroke patients. However, even when examined as two separate groups, both TIA patients (n = 656) and CVA patients (n = 390) were significantly more likely to experience a perioperative stroke when operated upon early rather than in a delayed fashion (TIA patients, 3.3% vs 0.9%, P = .05; CVA patients, 9.4% vs 2.4%, P = .003). There were no significant differences in demographics or other meaningful variables between patients who underwent early CEA and those who underwent delayed CEA.\nIn a large institutional experience, patients who underwent CEA <or=4 weeks of ipsilateral TIA or stroke experienced a significantly increased rate of perioperative stroke compared with patients who underwent CEA in a more delayed fashion. This was true for both TIA and stroke patients, although the results were more impressive among stroke patients. On the basis of these results, we continue to recommend that waiting period of 4 weeks be considered in stroke patients who are candidates for CEA.",

    "abstract": "Among various methods to achieve rapid occlusion of the aorta during endovascular repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, particular emphasis is placed on two techniques that have been incorporated into our endovascular repair practice. The sheath-over-balloon technique (the Loan SOB technique) facilitates hemodynamic stability by transfemoral endovascular placement of an aortic occlusion balloon catheter to the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The balloon-ahead-of-graft technique (the Hornsby BAG technique) allows suprarenal hemodynamic control using a stent-graft system with a built-in balloon. The two techniques are simple, quick, and effective in achieving hemodynamic stability.",

A 34-year-old man with nephrotic syndrome and hepatic dysfunction presented to the hospital after a 3-month history of lower extremity swelling with an acute deterioration in his condition. Magnetic resonance venography diagnosed a massive IVC occlusion with thrombosis of the entire IVC, iliac veins, and renal vein. He was treated with thrombolysis, and a chronic occlusion of the infrahepatic IVC was discovered. After venous stenting of the IVC and iliac veins, he dramatically improved. After 24 months, he remains symptom-free with a patent IVC and iliac veins.",

The stent's fate is the Achille's heel of this technique; this is the reason why a careful follow-up and further studies are required.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury is a rare complication in patients with aortic dissection. The extrinsic arterial supply to the spinal cord, diminishing caudally, often becomes critically dependent on the great radicular artery (GRA) of Adamkiewicz at the thoracolumbar spine. There are no prior reports of spinal injury or ischemia caused by chronic aortic dissection. We report on a 51-year-old patient with chronic type B dissection of the aorta from below the subclavian takeoff through the iliac arteries, presented with multiple episodes of transient (1 to 5 minutes) spinal ischemic attacks, entailing sudden loss of motor and sensory functions in both legs, with collapse of the patient on the ground. GRA imaging acquired with 64-channel computed tomography angiography enabled aortic fenestration from T11 to L1, performed with supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (T8 to L2) via thoracoabdominal access. We critically appraise the pertinent literature.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of luminal area is essential for the optimal performance of venous bypass grafts. However, injury and response to the arterial circulation evoke vascular remodelling that favors intimal hyperplasia, with luminal encroachment and inward remodelling. Potassium channel-opening drugs reduce tissue workload and peripheral vascular resistance and through these mechanisms could favor outward or expansive remodelling of vein grafts. We tested the hypothesis that levcromakalim, a potassium channel opener, would enhance expansive remodelling in vein grafts.\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 33 rats with vena cava-to-aorta bypass grafts. Drugs were administered via osmotic pump for 7 days after surgery. Half the cohort had bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) infused at day 6. Morphometric analysis was conducted of pressure perfusion-fixed grafts harvested at 1 week and 4 weeks.\nAt 1 week, lumen area was similar in both groups (1.82 +/- 0.39 mm(2) placebo vs 1.85 +/- 0.36 mm(2) levcromakalim), although medial cell density and BrdU staining were significantly increased in the placebo group. At 4 weeks, lumen area was unchanged in the placebo group (1.88 +/- 0.51 mm(2)) but had increased to 2.32 +/- 0.46 mm(2) in the levcromakalim group (P = .039 vs 1 week), with a very significant reduction in the intimal area (levcromakalim, 0.06 +/- 0.02 mm(2) vs placebo, 0.33 +/- 0.17 mm(2); P = .001).\nEarly, short-term treatment with levcromakalim favors expansive remodelling of experimental vein grafts to mimic the effect of external stenting. This expansive remodelling was associated with a reduction in medial cell proliferation at 1 week.\nCritical limb ischemia can be treated by bypass surgery or angioplasty, but inward remodelling with restenosis is a common problem. There has been little previous experimental work to identify treatments associated with expansive remodelling, which would increase the chances of vessel patency. Here, in a randomized trial, we show that short-term treatment with a potassium channel opener (a class of drug that can be used to treat hypertension) results in strong, expansive remodelling, with increases the lumen area and graft size of experimental vein grafts by >25%.",

    "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) have both been shown to possess vasoprotective properties. NO has successfully inhibited intimal hyperplasia in both small-animal and large-animal experimental models, whereas CO has only been studied in rodents. Evidence suggests that these two molecules may exert their vascular effects through common as well as unique signaling pathways. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a low concentration of inhaled CO on intimal hyperplasia in a large-animal model and if CO and NO treatment could exert a synergistic effect to inhibit this process.\nBalloon angioplasty was performed in a porcine model. Animals received inhaled CO (250 ppm) delivered preoperatively for 60 minutes or preoperatively and intraoperatively. Blood was collected for carboxyhemoglobin (COHgb) measurements at the start of the operation and every 30 minutes during the operation. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout. To study the effect of combined CO and NO treatment, another group of pigs received inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene transfer in one iliac artery and control gene transfer (AdlacZ) in the contralateral iliac artery, with or without preoperative and intraoperative inhaled CO. Adenoviral infection was performed immediately after balloon injury. All animals were euthanized at 3 weeks, and iliac arteries were collected for histologic and morphometric analysis.\nOne hour of pretreatment with CO was associated with modest and transient elevations in COHgb levels, resulting in a 25.6% reduction in neointimal area and a 10% reduction in intimal area/medial area ratio (I/M) 3 weeks after injury (NS). In contrast, preoperative followed by intraoperative CO administration increased COHgb in a sustained fashion and inhibited neointima formation by 51.7% and I/M by 31% (P < .001). There was no evidence of toxicity associated with this administration of CO. The treatment of injured iliac arteries with the control adenoviral vector AdlacZ did not further increase the inhibitory effect of CO on intimal hyperplasia. The combination of inhaled CO and iNOS gene transfer resulted in greater protection, however, with a 64% reduction in neointimal area and a 48% reduction in I/M (P < .001).\nCO is an effective means of reducing intimal hyperplasia in large animals after vascular injury when delivered during the operative procedure. No toxicity was associated with the increase in COHgb. The combination of CO and NO provided additional protection against the vascular injury response, with a greater reduction in neointima formation. These data suggest that these agents may prove to be clinically beneficial in prolonging vascular patency after interventions.",

    "abstract": "The new millennium has seen an increase in vascular residency vacancies. The American Board of Vascular Surgery recently proposed new training paradigms, but their impact on recruitment remains unknown. We surveyed vascular fellows regarding factors and timing of career decisions to determine an optimal strategy for recruitment.\nSurveys were sent electronically to vascular residents for completion. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Additional data were obtained from the National Resident Matching Program.\nOf the 90 fellows that responded, 84% committed to vascular surgery during residency. Of these, 18% decided during postgraduate year 1, 54% by year 2, 84% by year three, and 95% by year 4. Sixteen percent of all trainees decided in medical school. Seventy-three percent of residents performed a minimum of 20 to 50 cases before reaching a decision. Among the group deciding between years 2 to 4 of residency, there was a significant difference in the number of vascular rotations before career commitment (P = .0001). In the 2004 Match, 21% of vascular residency positions were unfilled, up from 12% in 2003, 9% in 2002, and 4% in 2001.\nLeaders in the field of vascular surgery have proposed focused training through the new paradigms. The incline in unmatched vascular residency positions over the past 4 years highlights the importance of a strategic plan to optimize recruitment. Few current trainees decided early in training about career choice, and volume appears critical to the decision process. Utilizing the current matching system (an 18-month process) and without any proactive change in recruitment, an integrated program after medical school would be reasonable for only 16% of applicants, or the 3+3 option for 54% of residents. For the new paradigms to be successful and to prevent more unfilled positions, increased medical student integration into vascular rotations and early active exposure to endovascular and open procedures during general surgical training will be necessary across the country.",

    "abstract": "Nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL), such as webs and spurs described by May and Thurner, are commonly found in the asymptomatic general population. However, the clinical syndrome, variously known as May-Thurner syndrome, Cockett syndrome, or iliac vein compression syndrome, is thought to be a relatively rare contributor of chronic venous disease (CVD), predominantly affecting the left lower extremity of young women. The present study describes the much broader disease profile that has emerged with the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) scanning for diagnosis and analyzes stent placement outcome in two specific NIVL subsets that may offer clues to their pathogenic role.\nAmong 4026 patients with CVD symptoms spanning the range of CEAP clinical classes, IVUS examinations were selectively done in severely symptomatic patients for indications as described. Iliac vein obstructive lesions were found in 938 limbs of 879 patients; 53% of the limbs had NIVL, 40% were post-thrombotic, and 7% were a combination. Stents were placed in 332 limbs in 319 patients in two NIVL subsets. The subsets, one with and one without associated distal limb reflux, were compared. Reflux was left untreated in the first subset.\nThe median age was 54 years (range, 18 to 90 years). The female-male ratio was 4:1 and the left-right ratio was 3:1. NIVL lesions in the iliac vein occurred at the iliac artery crossing (proximal lesion) and also at the hypogastric artery crossing (distal lesion), a new IVUS finding. Venography was only 66% sensitive, with 34% of venograms appearing \"normal.\" IVUS had a diagnostic sensitivity of >90%. The cumulative results observed at 2.5 years after stent placement in the NIVL subsets with reflux and without reflux, respectively, were complete relief of pain 82% and 77%, complete relief of swelling 47% and 53%, complete stasis ulcer healing 67% and 76%, and overall clinical relief outcome 75% and 79%. These results are nearly identical between the two subsets even though distal reflux remained uncorrected in the NIVL plus reflux subset.\nNIVL has high prevalence and a broad demographic spectrum in patients with CVD. Similar lesions in the asymptomatic general population may be permissive of future development of CVD. Stent placement alone, without correction of associated reflux, often provides relief.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and/or stenting (RA-PTAS) is increasingly being used as an alternative to surgery for renal artery revascularization. Unfortunately, renal function responses after RA-PTAS appear to be inferior to those observed after surgical revascularization both in terms of improving and preventing deterioration of renal function postintervention. Atheroembolism during RA-PTAS has been postulated as a potential cause for the disparate results. Strategies to limit the occurrence of atheroembolism, such as the use of distal embolic protection (DEP) systems, may result in improved outcomes after RA-PTAS.\nAll RA-PTAS procedures performed with DEP (using a commercially available temporary balloon occlusion and aspiration catheter) between October 2003 and July 2005 were reviewed. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated preintervention and 4 to 6 weeks postintervention using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Renal function and hypertension response rates as well as procedural data were classified and reported according to American Heart Association guidelines. Renal function improvement and deterioration were defined as a 20% increase and decrease in eGFR, respectively, compared with preoperative values. Continuous and categoric data were analyzed using paired t tests and repeated measures linear models.\nDEP was used in 32 RA-PTAS procedures in 15 women and 11 men with a mean age of 71 years. All patients were hypertensive, 24 (92%) had renal insufficiency, and the mean preintervention degree of renal artery stenosis was 79%. Immediate technical success was achieved in 100% of RA-PTAS cases. Mean pre- and postintervention serum creatinine and eGFR values were 1.9 vs 1.6 mg/dL (P < .001) and 37 vs 43 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P < .001), respectively. Renal function was defined as improved after 17 (53%) of 32 procedures and worsened in none (0%).\nRA-PTAS using DEP resulted in 4- to 6-week postintervention renal function results approximating those of surgical revascularization. These data suggest that DEP use may prevent renal function harm during RA-PTAS as a result of atheroembolism and warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "To explore the efficacy of cycle training in the treatment of intermittent claudication, the present study compared performance and physiologic effects of cycle training with more conventional treadmill walking training in a group of patients with claudication.\nForty-two individuals with peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication (24 men, 18 women) were stratified by gender and the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and then randomized to a treadmill (n = 13), cycle (n = 15), or control group (n = 14). Treadmill and cycle groups trained three times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the control group did not train during this period. Maximal and pain-free exercise times were measured on graded treadmill and cycle tests before and after training.\nTreadmill training significantly improved maximal and pain-free treadmill walking times but did not improve cycle performance. Cycle training significantly improved maximal cycle time but did not improve treadmill performance. However, there was evidence of a stronger cross-transfer effect between the training modes for patients who reported a common limiting symptom during cycling and walking at baseline. There was also considerable variation in the training response to cycling, and a subgroup of responsive patients in the cycle group improved their walking performance by more than the average response observed in the treadmill group.\nThese findings suggest that cycle exercise is not effective in improving walking performance in all claudication patients but might be an effective alternative to walking in those who exhibit similar limiting symptoms during both types of exercise.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of limbs affected by ischemic ulceration is poorly understood. In this report, we describe the outcome of limbs with stable chronic leg ulcers and arterial insufficiency that were treated with wound-healing techniques in patients who were not candidates for revascularization.\nA prospectively maintained database of limb ulcers treated at a comprehensive wound center was used to identify patients with arterial insufficiency, defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.7 or a toe pressure <50 mm Hg. Patients were treated without revascularization when medical comorbidity or anatomic considerations did not allow revascularization with acceptable risk. Ulcers were treated with a protocol emphasizing pressure relief, d\u00e9bridement, infection control, and moist wound healing. Risk factors analyzed for their affect on healing and amputation risk included age, gender, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL), severity of ischemia measured by ABI or toe pressure, wound grade, wound size, and wound location.\nBetween January 1999 and March 2005, 142 patients with 169 limbs having arterial insufficiency and full-thickness ulceration were treated without revascularization. Mean patient age was 70.8 +/- 4.5. Diabetes mellitus was present in 70.4% of limbs and chronic renal insufficiency in 27.8%. Toe amputations or other foot-sparing procedures were performed in 28% of limbs. Overall, limb loss occurred in 37 patients. By life-table analysis, 19% of limbs required amputation < or =6 months of initial treatment and 23% at 12 months. Complete wound closure was achieved in 25% by 6 months and in 52% by 12 months. Statistical analysis showed a correlation between ABI and the risk of limb loss. In patients with an ABI <0.5, 28% and 34% of limbs experienced limb loss at 6 and 12 months, respectively, compared with 10% and 15% of limbs in patients with an ABI >0.5 (P = .01). The only risk factor associated with wound closure was initial wound size (P < .005).\nLimb salvage can be achieved in most patients with arterial insufficiency and uncomplicated chronic nonhealing limb ulcers using a program of wound management without revascularization. Healing proceeds slowly, however, requiring more than a year in many cases. Patients with an ABI <0.5 are more likely to require amputation. Interventions designed to improve outcomes in critical limb ischemia should stratify outcomes based on hemodynamic data and should include a comparative control group given the natural history of ischemic ulcers treated in a dedicated wound program.",

    "abstract": "Popliteal arterial trauma carries the greatest risk of limb loss of any peripheral vascular injury. The purpose of this study was to analyze outcomes after popliteal arterial injuries and identify factors contributing to disability.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted of prospectively collected trauma data from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). We studied all patients with popliteal arterial injury in terms of demographics, injury patterns, interventions, limb salvage, resource utilization, and outcomes.\nWe identified 1395 popliteal arterial injuries among the 1,130,000 patients in the NTDB, for an incidence <0.2%. The patients were 82% male, with a mean age of 33 years, and they presented with a mean initial systolic blood pressure of 124 mm Hg, base deficit -4.6, injury severity score of 11.8, and an extremity abbreviated injury score of 2.6. The mechanism was blunt in 61% and penetrating in 39%, and significant baseline demographic differences existed between the two groups. Associated ipsilateral lower-extremity trauma included combined popliteal arterial and venous (AV) injuries, fractures and dislocations, and major nerve disruptions. Fasciotomies were performed in 49%, complex soft tissue repairs in 24%, and amputations in 14.5%. The overall mean hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay were 16.9 and 5.9 days. The mean functional independence measure for locomotion was 2.8, but was significantly lower for patients with blunt trauma. In-hospital mortality was 4.5% and did not significantly differ by mechanism. Amputation rates were 15% with combined AV injuries, 21% for associated nerve injuries, 12% for major soft tissue disruptions, and 21% for femur, 12% for knee, and 20% for tibia-fibula fractures or dislocations. Among the 312 patients with combined AV injuries, those with blunt mechanism had a significantly higher amputation rate than those with penetrating injury (27% vs 9%, P < .001). Adjusting for age, gender, mechanism, and overall physiologic impact of injuries sustained, independent predictors of amputation in logistic regression analysis of the entire cohort included fracture (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 4.1), complex soft tissue injury (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.0), nerve injury (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.8), and extremity abbreviated injury score (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2).\nPopliteal vascular injury remains an uncommon but challenging clinical entity associated with significant rates of limb loss, functional disability, and mortality. Blunt vs penetrating mechanism and associated musculoskeletal injuries generally involve longer hospital stays, worse functional outcomes, and twice the amputation rate.",

    "abstract": "The approach to penetrating trauma of the head and neck has undergone significant evolution and offers unique challenges during wartime. Military munitions produce complex injury patterns that challenge conventional diagnosis and management. Mass casualties may not allow for routine exploration of all stable cervical blast injuries. The objective of this study was to review the delayed evaluation of combat-related penetrating neck trauma in patients after evacuation to the United States.\nFrom February 2003 through April 2005, a series of patients with military-associated penetrating cervical trauma were evacuated to a single institution, prospectively entered into a database, and retrospectively reviewed.\nSuspected vascular injury from penetrating neck trauma occurred in 63 patients. Injuries were to zone II in 33%, zone III in 33%, and zone I in 11%. The remaining injuries involved multiple zones, including the lower face or posterior neck. Explosive devices wounded 50 patients (79%), 13 (21%) had high-velocity gunshot wounds, and 19 (30%) had associated intracranial or cervical spine injury. Of the 39 patients (62%) who underwent emergent neck exploration in Iraq or Afghanistan, 21 had 24 injuries requiring ligation (18), vein interposition or primary repair (4), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft interposition (1), or patch angioplasty (1). Injuries occurred to the carotid, vertebral, or innominate arteries, or the jugular vein. After evacuation to the United States, all patients underwent radiologic evaluation of the head and neck vasculature. Computed tomography angiography was performed in 45 patients (71%), including six zone II injuries without prior exploration. Forty (63%) underwent diagnostic arteriography that detected pseudoaneurysms (5) or occlusions (8) of the carotid and vertebral arteries. No occult venous injuries were noted. Delayed evaluation resulted in the detection of 12 additional occult injuries and one graft thrombosis in 11 patients. Management included observation (5), vein or PTFE graft repair (3), coil embolization (2), or ligation (1).\nPenetrating multiple fragment injury to the head and neck is common during wartime. Computed tomography angiography is useful in the delayed evaluation of stable patients, but retained fragments produce suboptimal imaging in the zone of injury. Arteriography remains the imaging study of choice to evaluate for cervical vascular trauma, and its use should be liberalized for combat injuries. Stable injuries may not require immediate neck exploration; however, the high prevalence of occult injuries discovered in this review underscores the need for a complete re-evaluation upon return to the United States.",

In this study, we analyze our experience with patients who underwent synchronous carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and coronary artery bypass graft procedures (CABG) for hemodynamically significant (>70%) asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and coronary artery disease (CAD).\nDemographics and outcomes of all patients undergoing synchronous CEA/CABG for asymptomatic carotid stenosis between April 1980 and January 2005 were reviewed from our vascular registry and patient charts. We included patients who underwent standard patching of their carotid artery and those undergoing eversion CEA. All neurologic events within the first 30 days that persisted >24 hours were considered a stroke. For purposes of comparison, we also reviewed outcomes for patients undergoing synchronous CEA/CABG for symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nAsymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (>70%) was the indication in 702 patients (276 women and 426 men) undergoing 758 CEAs. In the asymptomatic group, 22 patients, of which 21 succumbed to cardiac dysfunction, and one died from a hemorrhagic stroke. The overall mortality rate was 3.1%. Seven permanent nonfatal neurologic deficits occurred in this series (1 woman, 6 men). The combined stroke mortality was 4.3%. This compares to a 30-day stroke mortality of 6.1% in 132 symptomatic combined CEA/CABG patients. The difference in stroke mortality in women compared with men was not significant.\nIn this experience, patients presenting with hemodynamically significant (>70%) asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis can undergo synchronous CEA/CABG with low morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of patients with carotid artery occlusion is controversial. A few studies have concluded that patients with internal carotid artery occlusion carry a high risk of neurologic events. None of these previously reported studies analyze the natural history of internal artery occlusion contralateral to carotid endarterectomy (CEA), except for a small series including a subset of patients from two randomized trials, the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. This study analyzes the natural history of patients with carotid artery occlusion contralateral to CEA, specifically assessing long-term neurologic events occurring in the hemisphere associated with the occluded carotid artery.\nOf the 599 CEAs in 544 patients that were included in two previously updated prospective studies, 63 patients had contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion, and their perioperative and long-term outcomes were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the rate of freedom from late stroke occurring in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery. The stroke-free survival rate was also noted.\nMean follow-up was 58 months (range, 1 to 147 months). One perioperative stroke (1.6%) occurred, which was not in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery. Two late strokes (3.2%) and nine transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) (14.3%) occurred involving the hemisphere of the occluded carotid artery. There were also three late TIAs (4.8%) and no late strokes involving the hemisphere supplied by the operative site. There were a total of 14 late deaths. Fifteen patients had late > or =50% restenosis of the operative side. Six of these had neurologic events (TIA/stroke) involving the hemisphere of the occluded carotid artery, in contrast to five of 48 patients with no restenosis who had neurologic symptoms (P < .001). Freedom from late strokes in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years was 98%, 96%, 96%, and 96%, respectively. The stroke-free survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 90%, 87%, 80%, and 59%, respectively.\nThe natural history of carotid artery occlusion contralateral to CEA is relatively benign. This may suggest a protective effect of carotid endarterectomy on the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the carotid occlusion from late strokes.",

    "abstract": "Embolic protection devices (EPDs) consisting of an internal carotid artery (ICA) filter or balloon occlusion are typically used during carotid artery stenting (CAS). This study compares the technical difficulties encountered using these two types of EPD.\nA retrospective review was conducted of patients undergoing CAS using a balloon occlusion EPD (balloon group: PercuSurge GuardWire) or filter EPD (filter group: Accunet, AngioGuard, or FilterWire). Complications were defined as minor stroke, National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scale <3; major stroke, NIH stroke scale > or =3; transient ischemic attack (TIA), reversible focal neurologic impairment; technical, reversible neurologic compromise during EPD deployment, inability to cross lesion, ICA spasm requiring treatment, EPD-related factors that prolonged CAS.\nCAS (n = 141) was performed in 133 patients (82% men) with a mean age of 72 of years. Comorbidities included diabetes, 35%; coronary artery disease, 75%; hypertension, 82%; and renal insufficiency, 15%. Indication was previous cerebrovascular accident in 10%, TIA in 29%, and asymptomatic >80% stenosis in 61%. Primary lesions were treated in 83% vs restenosis in 17%. The 30-day event rate was 1.4% major stroke, 2.1% minor stoke, 1.4% myocardial infarction, and 0.7% death. The overall combined 30-day stroke, death, and myocardial infarction rate was 5.6%. The 30-day stroke and death rate was 4.0% in the balloon group (n = 99) and 4.6% in the filter group (n = 42, P = .51). EPD-related technical difficulties occurred in 15% of the balloon group and 31% of the filter group (P < .05). Technical difficulties included a 10% incidence of reversible neurologic compromise during balloon deployment compared with 0% in the filter group (P = .002) and 12% incidence of inability to cross the lesion before predilation in the filter group compared with 0% in the balloon group (P = .001).\nDuring CAS, both balloon occlusion and filter devices provide acceptable results and appear complimentary. Filters can be used preferentially to avoid a 10% incidence of reversible neurologic compromise associated with balloon occlusion, except in critically narrowed or tortuous lesions when balloon occlusion may be preferred because of a 12% need for unprotected predilatation with filters.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to evaluate the clinical results of resection for retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with vascular involvement.\nThe study group consisted of consecutive patients (mean age, 52 years) who underwent surgery for retroperitoneal STS with vascular involvement. The procedures were performed between 1988 and 2004. Vessel involvement by STS was classified as type I, artery and vein; type II, only artery; type III, only vein; and type IV, neither artery nor vein (excluded from the analysis). Patient data were prospectively gathered in a computerized database and retrospectively analyzed.\nOf 141 patients with retroperitoneal STS, 25 (17.7%) underwent surgery for tumors with vascular involvement. The most common vascular involvement pattern was vein only (type III) at 64%. Arterial and vein (type I) and arterial only (type II) involvement were observed in 16% and 20% of the cases, respectively. STS originating from the vessel wall (primary vessel involvement) was seen in eight patients, and 17 patients had secondary vascular involvement. Resection and vascular repair were done in 22 patients (no vascular repair in three patients due to ligation of the external iliac vein in one patient, and debulking procedures in two). All patients with arterial involvement (type I and II) had arterial reconstruction consisting of aortic replacement (Dacron, n = 3; and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [ePTFE], n = 2), iliac repair (Dacron, n = 3), and truncal reimplantation (n = 1). The inferior vena cava (6 ePTFE tube grafts, 3 ePTFE patches, 2 venoplasties), iliac vein (1 ePTFE bypass, 1 Dacron bypass, 1 venous patch), and superior mesenteric vein (1 anastomosis, 1 Dacron bypass) were restored in 80% of the patients (n = 16) with either arterial and venous or only venous involvement (type I and type III setting). Morbidity was 36% (hemorrhage, others), and mortality was 4%. At a median follow-up of 19.3 months (interquartile range, 12.8 to 49.9 months) the arterial patency rate was 88.9%, and the venous patency rate was 93.8% (primary and secondary). Thrombosis developed in one arterial and venous (type I) iliac reconstruction due to a perforated sigmoid diverticulitis 12 months after surgery. The local control rate was 82.4%. The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 90% and 66.7% after complete resection with tumor-free resection margins (n = 10 patients, median survival not reached at latest follow-up). The median survival was 21 months in patients with complete resection but positive resection margins (n = 7) and 8 months in patients with incomplete tumor clearance (n = 8, persistent local disease or metastasis).\nPatency rates and an acceptable surgical risk underline the value of en bloc resection of retroperitoneal STS together with involvement of blood vessels. The oncologic outcome is positive, especially after complete resection with tumor-free resection margins. A classification of vascular involvement can be used to plan resection and vascular replacement as well as to compare results among reports in a standardized fashion.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience with endovascular treatment of isolated iliac artery aneurysms (IAAs).\nMedical records for consecutive patients undergoing endovascular IAA repair from 1995 to 2004 were reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) angiograms were used to assess IAA location, size, and presence of endoleaks after endovascular repair. Rates of primary patency and freedom from secondary interventions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier life-table method.\nFrom July 1995 to November 2004, 45 patients (42 men), with a mean age of 75 years, underwent endovascular repair of 61 isolated IAAs: 41 common iliac, 19 internal iliac, and one external iliac. Five patients (11%) were symptomatic, although none presented with acute rupture. The mean preoperative IAA diameter was 4.2 +/- 1.7 cm. Fifteen patients (33%) had prior open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Local or regional anesthesia was used in 28 cases (62%). Thirty-four patients (75%) were treated with unilateral iliac stent-grafts, eight (18%) with bifurcated aortic stent-grafts, and three (7%) with coil embolization alone. Perioperative major complications included one early graft thrombosis that eventually required conversion to open repair and one groin hematoma that required operative evacuation. On follow-up, late complications included one additional graft thrombosis and one late death after amputation. No late ruptures occurred after endovascular repair, with a mean follow-up of 22 months (range, 0 to 60 months). The mean postoperative length of stay was 1.3 +/- 1.0 days. On postoperative CT scans obtained at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, aneurysm shrinkage was noted in 18%, 29%, 57%, 67%, and 83% of IAAs, respectively, compared with the baseline diameter. One hypogastric aneurysm enlarged in the presence of a later identified type II endoleak. Five endoleaks were noted (4 type II, 1 indeterminate) at 1 month, with four other endoleaks (1 type II, 1 type III, 2 indeterminate) identified on later CT scans. At 2 years, primary patency was 95%, and freedom from secondary interventions was 88%.\nEndovascular repair of isolated IAAs appears safe and effective, with initial results similar to those after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",

    "results": "From July 1995 to November 2004, 45 patients (42 men), with a mean age of 75 years, underwent endovascular repair of 61 isolated IAAs: 41 common iliac, 19 internal iliac, and one external iliac. Five patients (11%) were symptomatic, although none presented with acute rupture. The mean preoperative IAA diameter was 4.2 +/- 1.7 cm. Fifteen patients (33%) had prior open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Local or regional anesthesia was used in 28 cases (62%). Thirty-four patients (75%) were treated with unilateral iliac stent-grafts, eight (18%) with bifurcated aortic stent-grafts, and three (7%) with coil embolization alone. Perioperative major complications included one early graft thrombosis that eventually required conversion to open repair and one groin hematoma that required operative evacuation. On follow-up, late complications included one additional graft thrombosis and one late death after amputation. No late ruptures occurred after endovascular repair, with a mean follow-up of 22 months (range, 0 to 60 months). The mean postoperative length of stay was 1.3 +/- 1.0 days. On postoperative CT scans obtained at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, aneurysm shrinkage was noted in 18%, 29%, 57%, 67%, and 83% of IAAs, respectively, compared with the baseline diameter. One hypogastric aneurysm enlarged in the presence of a later identified type II endoleak. Five endoleaks were noted (4 type II, 1 indeterminate) at 1 month, with four other endoleaks (1 type II, 1 type III, 2 indeterminate) identified on later CT scans. At 2 years, primary patency was 95%, and freedom from secondary interventions was 88%.",

    "abstract": "Proper proximal fixation and stent-graft sealing within the aneurysm neck are critical for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) durability. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the gold standard for preoperative sizing of endograft diameters, but the accuracy of these measurements is uncertain because they rely on static images of a dynamic process. The aortic configuration and diameter may change during the cardiac cycle. We studied these phenomena using dynamic electrocardiograph-triggered magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\nEleven consecutive EVAR patients were included. Dynamic MRA was used to perform preoperative and postoperative measurements. Changes were measured in transverse aortic sections 10 mm below the lowest renal artery (level A), at the level of the renal arteries (level B), and 3 cm above the lowest renal artery (level C). Data were analyzed using image segmentation software. Aortic area and diameter changes along 256 axes were determined.\nDynamic MRA demonstrated significant aortic area changes during the cardiac cycle before and after EVAR at all three measured levels. Pre-EVAR aortic area significantly increased per cardiac cycle: 8.4% at level A; 9.3% at level B; and 13.3% at level C (P < .001 for all levels). Post-EVAR aortic area increased 9.7% at level A, 9.6% at level B, and 15.8% at level C per cardiac cycle (P < .001 for all levels). Significant diameter changes during cardiac cycles were also observed at all three levels. Pre-EVAR mean diameter changed up to 8.9% (P < .001) compared with post-EVAR aortic changes of up to 11.5% (P < .001). EVAR had no effect on change in aortic area and diameter. Dynamic MRA also demonstrated that pulsatile aortic distension was not equal in all axes, but rather occurred as an asymmetrical expansion and contraction.\nIn patients with (atherosclerotic) aneurysm disease, the aortic dimensions at the level of and proximal to the aneurysm neck change during the cardiac cycle. This phenomenon is preserved after EVAR. Therefore, maximum diameter using dynamic MRA may not be similar to the maximum diameter with static CTA in all patients, and a standard regimen of 10% to 15% oversizing of an endograft based on static CTA images may be inadequate for some patients. Further studies using dynamic MRA to evaluate effects of different endografts are anticipated, with possible consequences for endograft designs.",

    "abstract": "Local and regional anesthesia was used in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) shortly after its introduction, and the feasibility has been documented several times. Nevertheless, locoregional anesthesia has not become accepted on a large scale, probably owing to a traditional surgical attitude preferring general anesthesia. This study compared various anesthesia techniques in patients treated with EVAR for infrarenal aortic aneurysms.\nFrom July 1997 to August 2004, 5557 patients who underwent EVAR repair in 164 centers were enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry. Data were compared among three groups: a general anesthesia group (GA-G) of 3848 patients (69%), a regional anesthesia group (RA-G) of 1399 patients (25%), and the local anesthesia group (LA-G) of 310 patients (6%). Differences in preoperative and operative details among the three study groups were analyzed using the chi(2) test for discrete variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on early complications.\nThe duration of the operation was reduced in the LA-G (115.7 +/- 42.2 minutes) compared with the RA-G (127.6 +/- 52.8 min, P < .0009) and GA-G (133.3 +/- 59.1 minutes, P < .0001). Admission to the intensive care unit was significantly less for LA-G patients (2%) than RA-G (8.3%, P = .0004) and GA-G (16.2%, P < .0001), but RA-G still had a distinct advantage (P < .0001) over GA-G. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in LA-G (3.7 +/- 3.1 days [P < .0001] vs GA-G [P = .007] vs RA-G), but RA-G (5.1 +/- 7.5 days) still had an advantage (P < .0001) vs GA-G (6.2 +/- 8.5 days). In EUROSTAR, systemic complications were significantly lower both for LA-G (6.6%, P = .0015) and RA-G (9.5%, P = .0007) than for GA-G (13.0%).\nThe EUROSTAR data indicate that patients appeared to benefit when a locoregional anesthetic technique was used for EVAR. Locoregional techniques should be used more often to enhance the perioperative advantage of EVAR in treating infrarenal aneurysms of the abdominal aorta.",

    "abstract": "The technique of fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been used for the treatment a variety of aortic aneurysms. Although technically successful, longer-term results have been lacking. This article reports on the mid-term results of aneurysm repair with fenestrated and branched endografts from a European center with a large endovascular experience.\nBetween 2001 and 2005, 38 patients were prospectively enrolled in a single institution, investigational device protocol database. Indications for fenestrated or branched EVAR included unfavorable anatomy for traditional EVAR and an abdominal aortic aneurysm >5.5 cm in maximum diameter. Customized stent-grafts were either fenestrated or branched and based on the Zenith system. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Differences between groups were determined using analysis of variance with P < .05 considered significant.\nThe mean (SD) follow-up was 25.8 +/- 12.7 months (median, 25.0 months; range, 9 to 46 months), and no patients were lost to follow-up. All cause mortality was 13% (5/38), with all deaths occurring within the first postoperative year; 30-day mortality was 2.6%. No patient died during the operation. Completion angiography demonstrated successful sealing in 37 of 38 patients and an overall operative visceral vessel perfusion rate of 94% (82/87). Cumulative visceral branch patency was 92% at 46 months. Stent occlusions, when they did occur, all happened within the first postoperative year. All postoperative occlusions occurred in unstented fenestrations or scallops. No occlusions occurred in stented vessels. The difference in serum creatinine preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years was not significant (P = NS). No patient required dialysis. The aneurysm sac size decreased significantly during the first year and then remained stable (P < .05). Limb perfusion as assessed by the ankle/brachial index was not affected by the presence of a fenestrated or branched endograft.\nThe intermediate-term results of fenestrated and branched endografts support their continued use in patients with anatomic contraindications for standard EVAR. Close surveillance is mandatory for early identification of visceral or branched vessel stenosis and preocclusion. All cases of failure appear to occur during the first year and then level off in subsequent longer-term follow-up. This includes death, secondary interventions, branch vessel patency, and complications. As the procedure matures, long-term results and randomized clinical trials will ultimately be required to determine the safety, efficacy, and stability of this system.",

    "abstract": "In our transition from elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) to emergent ruptured AAA (r-AAA) repair with endovascular techniques, we recognized that the availability of endovascularly trained staff in the operating rooms and emergency departments, and adequate equipment were the limiting factors. To this end, we established a multidisciplinary protocol that facilitates endovascular repair (EVAR) of r-AAA.\nIn January 2002, we instituted a multidisciplinary approach that included the vascular surgeons, emergency department physicians, anesthesiologists, operating room staff, radiology technicians, and availability of a variety of stent-grafts to expedite EVAR of r-AAAs. Five patients with symptomatic, not ruptured AAAs suitable for EVAR underwent simulation of patients presenting to the emergency department with r-AAAs. Emergency department physicians alerted the on-call vascular surgery team (vascular surgeon, vascular resident or fellow) and the operating room staff, emergently performed an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in only hemodynamically stable patients with systolic blood pressures > or =80 mm Hg, and transported the patient to the operating room. The vascular surgeon informed the operating room staff to set up for EVAR and open surgical repair in an operating room equipped with interventional capabilities. The operating room setup was rehearsed with the anesthesiologists, operating room staff, and radiology technicians who were knowledgeable of the sequence of steps involved. Since then, 40 patients have undergone emergent EVAR for r-AAAs with general anesthesia.\nNo complications developed in any of the symptomatic (simulation) patients, and 40 (95%) of 42 patients with r-AAAs had a successful EVAR with Excluder (n = 27, 68%), AneuRx (n = 9, 23%), or the Zenith (n = 4, 10%) stent-grafts. The mean age was 73 years (range, 54 to 88 years), and pre-existing comorbidities included coronary artery disease in 26 (65%), hypertension in 23 (58%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 7 (18%), renal insufficiency not on dialysis in two (5%), and diabetes in nine (23%). Fourteen (38%) patients were diagnosed with r-AAAs at another hospital and subsequently were transferred to us, and 26 (62%) presented directly to the emergency department at our institution. At the initial presentation, 30 patients (75%) were hemodynamically stable and either had a CT scan at an outside hospital or in the emergency department, and 10 (25%) hemodynamically unstable patients with systolic blood pressures <80 mm Hg were rushed to the operating room for EVAR without a preoperative CT scan. The mean time from the presumptive diagnosis of a r-AAA in the emergency department to the operating room for EVAR was 20 minutes (range, 10 to 35 minutes), and the mean operative time from skin incision to closure was 80 minutes (range, 35 to 125 minutes). Seven patients (18%) needed supraceliac aortic occlusion balloon, and six (15%) needed aortouniiliac stent-grafts. The mean blood loss was 455 mL (range, 115 to 1100 mL). Two patients each (5%) developed myocardial infarction, renal failure, and ischemic colitis, seven (18%) developed abdominal compartment syndrome, and seven (18%) died. Over a mean follow-up of 17 months, three patients with endovascular r-AAA repair required four secondary procedures.\nThe early results show that emergent endovascular treatment of hemodynamically stable and unstable patients is associated with a limited mortality of 18% once a standardized protocol is established. There is an increased recognition of emerging complications with an endovascular approach, and a synchrony of disciplines must be developed to initiate a successful program for endovascular treatment of r-AAAs.",

The mean age was 73 years (range, 54 to 88 years), and pre-existing comorbidities included coronary artery disease in 26 (65%), hypertension in 23 (58%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 7 (18%), renal insufficiency not on dialysis in two (5%), and diabetes in nine (23%). Fourteen (38%) patients were diagnosed with r-AAAs at another hospital and subsequently were transferred to us, and 26 (62%) presented directly to the emergency department at our institution. At the initial presentation, 30 patients (75%) were hemodynamically stable and either had a CT scan at an outside hospital or in the emergency department, and 10 (25%) hemodynamically unstable patients with systolic blood pressures <80 mm Hg were rushed to the operating room for EVAR without a preoperative CT scan. The mean time from the presumptive diagnosis of a r-AAA in the emergency department to the operating room for EVAR was 20 minutes (range, 10 to 35 minutes), and the mean operative time from skin incision to closure was 80 minutes (range, 35 to 125 minutes). Seven patients (18%) needed supraceliac aortic occlusion balloon, and six (15%) needed aortouniiliac stent-grafts. The mean blood loss was 455 mL (range, 115 to 1100 mL). Two patients each (5%) developed myocardial infarction, renal failure, and ischemic colitis, seven (18%) developed abdominal compartment syndrome, and seven (18%) died. Over a mean follow-up of 17 months, three patients with endovascular r-AAA repair required four secondary procedures.",

    "abstract": "Despite lower reported patency rates than open bypass, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) may result in symptom relief, limb salvage, maintenance of ambulation and independent living, and overall improved quality of life. The goal of this study was to prospectively assess quality of life and functional outcomes after angioplasty and stenting in patients with chronic leg ischemia.\nFrom August to December 2002, 84 patients with 118 chronically ischemic limbs underwent PTA with or without stenting as part of an ongoing prospective project performed to examine management of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. All patients completed a preprocedure health questionnaire (Short Form 36) to provide adequate baseline data. Each patient was followed up every 3 months after treatment for 1 year to determine traditional outcomes of arterial patency, limb salvage, survival and amputation-free survival, and functional outcomes assessed according to improvement in quality of life, maintenance of ambulatory status, and maintenance of independent living status. The entire cohort was analyzed, as were subgroups of patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication and those with critical limb ischemia. Outcomes were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, the log-rank test for survival curves, and the one-sample t test. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine whether presentation and level of disease were independent predictors of outcome.\nOf the 84 patients, 54 (64.3%) were treated for claudication (34 aortoiliac occlusive disease and 20 infrainguinal disease), and 30 (35.7%) were treated for critical limb ischemia (11 aortoiliac occlusive disease and 19 infrainguinal disease). One-year results for the 54 patients with claudication were as follows: primary patency, 78.5%; limb salvage, 100%; amputation-free survival, 96.3%; survival, 96.3%; maintenance of ambulation status, 100%; and maintenance of independence, 100%. There was statistical improvement in all physical function categories, including physical function (29.4 +/- 8.9 vs 37.1 +/- 11.3; P < .0001), role-physical (32.5 +/- 11.3 vs 39.5 +/- 13.0; P = .0001), bodily pain (35.8 +/- 8.5 vs 42.9 +/- 10.9; P < .0001), and aggregate physical scoring (31.1 +/- 9.7 vs 38.1 +/- 11.5; P < .0001). One-year results for the 30 patients with critical limb ischemia were as follows: primary patency, 35.2%; limb salvage, 77.2%; amputation-free survival, 50.0%; survival, 60.0%; maintenance of ambulation status, 75.8%; and maintenance of independence, 92.8%. There was statistical improvement in bodily pain resolution (35.3 +/- 12.0 vs 46.6 +/- 12.0; P = .0009). Cox models with hazard ratios (HRs) revealed that presentation was a significant predictor for outcomes of primary patency (HR, 4.2; P= .0002), secondary patency (HR, 6.0; P < .0001), limb salvage (HR, 20.2; P = .0047), survival (HR, 10.9; P = .0002), and amputation-free survival (HR, 11.2; P < .0001). Conversely, the level of disease was predictive of outcome only for primary patency (HR, 1.8; P = .00289).\nDespite inferior reconstruction patency rates when compared with the historical results of open bypass, PTA provides excellent functional outcomes with good patient satisfaction, especially for treating claudication. These findings support a more liberal use of PTA intervention for patients with vasculogenic claudication.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is defined by the clustering in the same person of at least three risk factors such as hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein, hypertension, and abdominal obesity. In patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its relationship with the severity of peripheral circulatory insufficiency, inflammatory status, and cardiovascular comorbidity.\nThe presence of metabolic syndrome was assessed in 154 consecutive PAD patients (115 men, 39 women). Inflammatory status was assessed by measuring serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).\nMetabolic syndrome was present in 51.9% (42.7 % in men, 74.3% in women, P < .01). Patients with an ankle/brachial index (ABI) <0.64 (median) were more likely to have metabolic syndrome than those with less severe PAD (63.9% vs 42.8%, P < .02). The association between a low ABI and metabolic syndrome was maintained after adjustment for age and sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 4.68). Compared with PAD patients without metabolic syndrome, those with the syndrome had greater body mass index (28.2 [25.6; 29.8] kg/m(2) vs 26.1 [24.2; 27.7] kg/m(2), P < .01) and higher levels of CRP (3.9 [1.6; 7.6] mg/L vs 2.0 [1.1; 3.7] mg/L, P < .02). A previous myocardial infarction was documented in 58.2% of patients with and in 37.5% of those without metabolic syndrome (P < .01). At multivariate analysis, metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with previous myocardial infarction also after adjustment for ABI (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.38).\nMetabolic syndrome is present in >50% of PAD patients. The finding that well-established indicators of increased cardiovascular risk such as low ABI and increased CRP levels cluster with metabolic syndrome suggests that identification of this syndrome in these high-risk patients could indicate an even greater risk of cardiovascular events.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the growth and proliferation of blood vessels from existing vascular structures, and therapeutic angiogenesis seeks to promote blood vessel growth to improve tissue perfusion. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prototypic angiogenic agent that exists in vivo in multiple isoforms, and studies with VEGF to date had used single isoform therapy with disappointing results. We tested plasmid and adenoviral vectors encoding a zinc-finger DNA-binding transcription factor (ZFP-32E) that was designed to increase the expression of all major VEGF isoforms in a preclinical model of peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD) in hypercholesterolemic (ApoE knock-out) mice.\nUnilateral femoral artery ligation/excision was performed in 117 mice. At 7 days postoperatively, the ischemic tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles received either ZFP-32E treatment (125 microg of plasmid, 2.5 x 10(11) viral particle units [vpu] of adenovirus; some mice received a second plasmid injection 3 days later) or no-ZFP treatment (125 microg of beta-galactosidase [beta-gal], a plasmid-lacking insert, or an equal dose of adenoviral encoding beta-gal; some mice received a second plasmid injection 3 days later). Group 1 mice (n = 31) were euthanized 3 days later, and VEGF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were measured. Group 2 mice (n = 38) were euthanized 7 days later, and measures of capillary density, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were quantified. Group 3 mice (n = 48) were euthanized 28 days later, and changes in lower limb blood flow perfusion were measured.\nIn group 1, VEGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in those with ZFP-32E treatment vs beta-gal. In group 2, capillary density and proliferating cells were significantly greater and apoptosis was significantly lower in those with ZFP-32E treatment vs beta-gal. Finally, in group 3, changes in the perfusion ratio (ischemic/nonischemic limb) at 21 days after injection were significantly greater in those with ZFP-32E treatment vs no-ZFP treatment.\nThe ability of this engineered zinc-finger VEGF-activating transcription factor to induce therapeutic angiogenesis in hypercholesterolemic mice suggests this approach warrants investigation as a novel approach to treat PAOD.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty with stent placement (CAS) may offer an alternative treatment to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, in contrast to CEA, which has been shown to normalize impaired cerebral hemodynamics, the effects of CAS remain unclear. To investigate alterations in cerebral hemodynamics, we prospectively studied patients undergoing CAS and compared them with a group of similar patients undergoing CEA.\nTwenty-three patients undergoing CAS for recently symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were prospectively studied. Volume flow in the ICAs and basilar artery (BA) were measured with magnetic resonance volume flow quantification before CAS and 1 month after. The results were compared with those in 13 similar patients undergoing CEA and 40 control subjects without ICA stenosis.\nAfter CAS, volume flow in the ipsilateral ICA increased from 114 +/- 17 to 231 +/- 17 mL/min (P < .001), and total volume flow (ICAs plus BA) increased from 495 +/- 24 to 552 +/- 28 mL/min (P < .05). No significant changes were seen in the contralateral ICA and BA after CAS. Total volume flow and flow in the stenosed ICA normalized after CAS compared with control subjects. Volume flow values similarly improved after CEA.\nCAS results in a normalization of impaired cerebral hemodynamics, as assessed by magnetic resonance volume flow measurements. The degree of improvement is similar to that seen after CEA.",

    "abstract": "As the number of endovascular interventions increase and resources become scarce, surgeons need to be aware of cost-effective and efficient practice options. Many surgeons routinely admit their patients for overnight observation after uneventful endovascular interventions. Although this may be appropriate for patients with tissue loss and rest pain, we believe that peripheral angioplasty in patients with claudication can be safely performed as an outpatient procedure with significant cost savings.\nAll patients with intermittent claudication undergoing peripheral angioplasty by a single vascular surgeon were enrolled prospectively in a same-day discharge protocol. Involved arteries and use of stent and closure device were recorded. Time to mobilization and time to discharge were determined. Patients were observed in an observation unit by a registered nurse, and were examined by the surgeon at the time of ambulation and before discharge. Patients were admitted to the hospital if complications arose during the predetermined observation period. Periprocedural complications and reasons for admission were noted. Patients were evaluated at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 3 to 6 months after the intervention.\nDuring 27 months, 112 interventions were performed in 97 patients. The superficial femoral artery was the most frequent site of intervention (47%). Multiple sites had angioplasty in 27 (24%) procedures. Nine (8%) procedures resulted in admission. One patient was admitted for a major puncture site hematoma requiring blood transfusion, two patients for observation of a minor hematoma at the puncture site, one for chest pain, and one for observation of transient bradycardia. The mean time to mobilization was 1.4 +/- 1.3 hours, and the mean time to discharge was 2.8 +/- 1.2 hours. The average postprocedural cost for patients undergoing same-day discharge was $320 per patient, which contrasts with $1800 for routine overnight observation. No deaths or unplanned admissions to the hospital occurred < or =30 days of intervention.\nSame-day discharge after peripheral angioplasty is safe and cost-effective. Need for admission is evident within 2 hours. Routine admission after peripheral angioplasty for patients with claudication is unnecessary and should no longer be the standard of care.",

    "abstract": "In large randomized trials, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic stenosis has shown a net benefit compared with best medical treatment. To justify an increased number of procedures for this indication, the perioperative risk of stroke or death must not exceed that of the trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome in routine clinical practice in Sweden in a population-based study.\nThe Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) covers all centers performing CEA. Data on all registered CEAs during 1994 to 2003 were analyzed both for the whole time period and for two 5-year periods to study alterations over time. Four validation procedures of the registry were performed. Medical records were reviewed for both a random sample and a target sample (a total of 12% of the CEAs for asymptomatic stenosis). Swedvasc data were cross-matched with the In-Patient-Registry (used for reimbursement) and the Population-registry (death).\nA total of 6182 CEAs were registered, 671 being for asymptomatic stenosis. In the validation process, no missed registration of major stroke or death was found. Patients with asymptomatic stenosis had, when the whole time-period was analyzed, a perioperative combined stroke or death rate of 2.1%. Outcome improved over time; the combined stroke or death rate decreased from 3.3% (11/330) from 1994 to 1998 to 0.9% (3/341) from 1999 to 2003 (P = .026). During the second time period, no patient with a perioperative major stroke or death was reported.\nThis extensively validated national audit of CEA for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis showed results well comparable with those of the randomized trials. The results improved over time.",

    "abstract": "We present four patients with rapidly progressive claudication of the lower limbs due to extracranial giant cell arteritis. Additional findings suggestive of giant cell arteritis were involvement of the axillary or brachial arteries in two patients, symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis in three, and all patients had severely elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Lower limb involvement affected preferentially the femoropopliteal, deep femoral, and tibioperoneal arteries. Hypoechogenic, concentric mural thickening suggestive of vasculitis was readily visible in all involved arterial segments by duplex ultrasound imaging, whereas angiography was rather unspecific. Typical changes for large-vessel vasculitis were also detectable by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorine-18-desoxyglucose positron emission tomography. More widespread use of these vascular imaging techniques may show that giant cell arteritis of the lower limbs is more frequent than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Many factors impair healing of chronic venous ulcer (CVU), and many theories have been proposed to explain their pathogenesis. Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) influences tissue regeneration and angiogenesis with effects on wound healing. Because FXIII properties depend upon its genetic variants, we investigated whether intragene polymorphisms may have modulating effects on the CVU area.\nThe study included 121 patients with nonhealing CVUs (CEAP clinical class C6) that included 67% with primary chronic venous disease (CVD), 26% with post-thrombotic ulcers, and 7% with mixed ulcer origin. Polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype them for Val34Leu, Pro564Leu, and Tyr204Phe variants in the FXIII-A subunit gene and for His95Arg variant in the FXIII-B subunit gene. The same variants were analyzed in 102 controls, healthy subjects who were case-matched by age and gender.\nGenotype distribution for all polymorphisms investigated was not significantly different between cases and controls. Conversely, our CVU cases had a mean ulcer area inversely related with the presence of both Leu34 and Leu564 alleles (ValVal, 12.3 +/- 22.4 cm2 vs LeuLeu, 3.9 +/- 2.6 cm2, P = .002; ProPro, 10.2 +/- 21.2 cm2 vs LeuLeu, 2.9 +/- 1.4 cm2, P = .002). In combined analysis, those cases who were wild-type for both variants (ValVal34/ProPro564) had a further increase in mean ulcer size compared with cases carrying both variants (Leu34/Leu564) (13.3 +/- 27.1 cm2 vs 5.2 +/- 5.6 cm2; P = .034).\nNo correlation exists between FXIII genotypes and the prevalence of chronic venous ulcers, thus demonstrating that FXIII polymorphisms have no role in ulcer development. In contrast, FXIII-gene variants, in particular the non-wild-type alleles Leu34 and Leu564, were associated with a smaller venous ulcer surface and might have favorable effects on reparative processes.",

Our objective was to analyze the influence of increased energy dosing on immediate occlusion and recanalization rates after ELT of the GSV.\nGSVs were treated with either 15 or 30 W of laser power by using a 940-nm diode laser with continuous fiber pullback and tumescent local anesthesia. Patients were followed up prospectively with duplex ultrasonography at day 1 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.\nA total of 114 GSVs were treated with 15 W, and 149 GSVs were treated with 30 W. The average endovenous fluence equivalents were 12.8 +/- 5.1 J/cm2 and 35.1 +/- 15.6 J/cm2, respectively. GSV occlusion rates according to the method of Kaplan and Meier for the 15- and 30-W groups were 95.6% and 100%, respectively, at day 1, 90.4% and 100% at 3 months, and 82.7% and 97.0% at 12 months after ELT (log-rank; P = .001). An endovenous fluence equivalent exceeding 20 J/cm2 was associated with durable GSV occlusion after 12 months' follow-up, thus suggesting a schedule for dosing of laser energy with respect to the vein diameter.\nHigher dosing of laser energy shows a 100% immediate success rate and a significantly reduced recanalization rate during 12 months' follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Patients affected by peripheral arterial disease (PAD) incur a heightened risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular mortality. We examined risk factors, medications, and prognosis of outpatients with PAD enrolled in two national, prospective, practice-based Canadian registries that encompassed 484 physician practices: the Vascular Protection and Guideline Oriented Approach in Lipid Lowering registries.\nThe 2 registries were combined to analyze 9810 patients with vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or age 65 years or older plus at least 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors. Risk factors, medications, and major cardiovascular events were recorded at baseline and again at 6 months' follow-up.\nCompared with patients without PAD (n = 8303), those with PAD (n = 1507) had substantially worse risk factor profiles and were more likely to have coexisting coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Both groups received high rates of treatment with evidence-based therapies, including antiplatelet drugs, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Despite this, patients with PAD had a nearly twofold higher risk of major cardiovascular events at 6 months than non-PAD patients (7.3% vs 4.1%; P < .0001). After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, the presence of PAD at baseline continued to predict a heightened risk of adverse vascular sequelae (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.01; P < .0001).\nThese data support a strong relationship between PAD and worsened vascular prognosis that is independent of both conventional vascular risk factors and concomitant cardiovascular disease. The presence of PAD should therefore provide a clear impetus for intensive risk factor modification and use of preventive medical therapy in affected patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is rapidly becoming the predominant technique for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Results from current studies, however, are conflicting on the effect of EVAR on renal function compared with standard open repair. Furthermore, data for open repair in patients with baseline renal insufficiency suggests worse outcomes, including renal function. This analysis compared the effects of open repair vs EVAR on renal function in patients with baseline renal insufficiency.\nWe reviewed our records for patients with preoperative chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL) who underwent open repair or EVAR between 1999 and 2004. The same group of vascular surgeons at a single institution performed aneurysm repair on 98 patients: 46 open (37 men, 9 women) and 52 EVAR (50 men, 2 women). Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up serum creatinine and creatinine clearance were compared, as was the development of postoperative renal impairment (increase in serum creatinine >30%).\nSerum creatinine and creatinine clearance were not statistically different between the open and EVAR groups during any time period studied. Likewise when comparing the magnitude of change in serum creatinine in patients between the postoperative and follow-up times with preoperative values, no significant differences existed between the open and EVAR groups. When the change in serum creatinine over time within each group was compared, however, the open group had a significant increase in serum creatinine postoperatively (2.43 +/- 1.20 vs 2.04 +/- 0.64, P = .012), which returned to baseline during follow-up (1.96 +/- 0.94, P = .504). Although serum creatinine in the EVAR group increased compared with preoperative values of 2.04 +/- 0.55 (postoperative, 2.27 +/- 1.04; follow-up, 2.40 +/- 1.37), this failed to reach statistical significance for the postoperative (P = .092) or follow-up (P = .081) periods. A similar pattern was noted in creatinine clearance. Postoperative renal impairment was noted in 13 open (28%) and 15 EVAR patients (29%) and was not statistically different between groups. Overall, two patients (4.3%) from the open group and four (7.7%) from the EVAR group required hemodialysis; one in the EVAR group required permanent hemodialysis. This difference was not statistically significant (P = .681).\nOpen and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with pre-existent renal insufficiency can be performed safely with preservation of renal function. In contrast to previous reports, no significant differences existed between open repair and EVAR in postoperative alterations in renal function. Although a significant increase in serum creatinine develops in patients with renal insufficiency postoperatively with open repair, this appears to be transient, and preoperative renal dysfunction alone should not exclude either approach. After EVAR, patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency continue to be at risk for progressive renal dysfunction, and protective measures should be taken to preserve renal function in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Selecting patients based on their risk profiles could improve the outcome after elective surgery of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) is a scoring system developed to determine such risk profiles. In other settings, the GAS has proved to have a predictive value for the postoperative outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the GAS was also valid for the patients in our hospital and to examine risk factors with a possible predictive value for postoperative mortality and morbidity.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study in a university hospital. The medical records of 229 patients who underwent open elective repair for an AAA in the period 1994 to 2003 were retrospectively analyzed to assess the GAS and to determine which of the examined risk factors had a predictive value for the prognosis.\nFive patients (2.2%) died after surgery and 30 (13.1%) had a major complication. The GAS was predictive for postoperative death (P = .021; sensitivity, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.00; specificity, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.73) and also for major morbidity (P = .029; sensitivity, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.78; specificity, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.76). The positive predictive value (mortality, 0.06; morbidity, 0.24) and the positive likelihood ratio (mortality, 3.07; morbidity, 2.14) were low, however. The best cutoff value for the GAS was determined at 77. All the deceased patients (100%) and 63.3% of those who had a major complication had a risk score of >or=77. Of all examined risk factors, suprarenal clamping during surgery was predictive of in-hospital mortality (8.3%, P = .017). For major morbidity, three risk factors, all of which are components of the GAS, were predictive: age (P = .046), cardiac disease (P = .032), and renal disease (P = .041).\nThe Glasgow Aneurysm Score has a predictive value for outcome after open elective AAA repair. Because of its relatively low positive predictive value for death and major morbidity, the GAS is of limited value in clinical decision-making for the individual high-risk patient. In some particular cases, however, the GAS can be a useful tool, especially for low-risk patients because it has good negative predictive value for this group. Suprarenal clamping was found to be a risk factor for postoperative death.",

    "abstract": "Open surgical repair for infected thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysms carries significant mortality and morbidity. Endovascular stent graft repair has been our preferred approach, although its role remains controversial because persistent infection is always a concern. We aimed to assess the efficacy and durability of endovascular stent graft repair in these patients.\nBetween August 2000 and November 2005, seven consecutive patients with eight infected pseudoaneurysms of the thoracic aorta were treated with endovascular stent graft repair. Patients were diagnosed based on a typical appearance of an infected pseudoaneurysm on imaging together with a positive bacteriology culture or clinical evidence of sepsis. The follow-up protocol included regular clinical examination, hematologic tests, and computed tomography scans.\nThere were six men and one woman with a median age of 68 years at operation. Three patients presented with an aortoenteric fistula. The operations were performed in the operating room with the image guidance of a mobile C-arm. Endovascular stent grafts were deployed successfully in all patients, with complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysms. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 1 to 6 weeks and followed by lifelong maintenance oral antibiotics. The median hospital stay was 27 days, with no hospital deaths. No paraplegia or other major complications occurred. Two patients with aortoesophageal fistula where the fistula tracts were persistent died during follow-up. The other five patients remained well, with no evidence of graft infection at a median follow-up of 34 months. A significant reduction in the diameter of the pseudoaneurysm (>5 mm) was noted on computed tomography scans after 12 months.\nEndovascular stent graft repair is effective and may be a durable option for infected pseudoaneurysms of the thoracic aorta.",

    "abstract": "The geometric and biomechanical changes that contribute to vein graft remodeling are not well established. We sought to measure patterns of adaptation in lower extremity vein grafts and assess their correlation with clinical outcomes.\nWe conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of patients undergoing infrainguinal reconstruction with autogenous conduit. In addition to standard duplex surveillance, lumen diameter (of a defined index segment of the conduit) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed by ultrasound imaging at surgery and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Graft dimensions and wall stiffness were correlated with clinical outcomes.\nThere were 92 patients and 96 limbs in this study. On average, vein graft lumen diameter increased during the first month of implantation from 0.37 +/- .01 cm to 0.45 +/- 0.02 cm (mean +/- SEM; P = .002), representing a relative change of +21.6% (median +/- 14%; range, -31 to +67%) during this period. Of the entire cohort, 72% of grafts demonstrated appreciable dilation of the index segment during the first month. Index segment lumen diameter did not change appreciably beyond 1 month, with the notable exception of arm vein conduits, which showed continued tendency to dilate. PWV increased during the first 6 months (17.2 +/- 1.2 m/s to 23.2 +/- 2.4 m/s; P = .008), reflecting a nearly 40% increase in conduit stiffness (2.0 +/- .6 Mdynes/cm to 3.3 +/- .8 Mdynes/cm, P = .01). The greatest relative increase (25%) in PWV occurred from months 1 to 3. Loss of primary patency occurred in 24 cases (19 revisions, 5 occlusions), with a mean reintervention time of 7.6 months. Grafts that demonstrated early positive remodeling (lumen dilatation) had a trend of increased primary patency (P = .08, log rank). Among the grafts that failed, a trend was noted toward greater wall stiffness at 1 month, 2.7 vs 1.5 Mdynes (P = .08).\nVein graft remodeling appears to involve at least two distinct temporal phases. Outward remodeling of the lumen occurs early, and wall stiffness changes occur in a more delayed fashion. Early outward remodeling may be important for successful vein graft adaptation.",

    "results": "There were 92 patients and 96 limbs in this study. On average, vein graft lumen diameter increased during the first month of implantation from 0.37 +/- .01 cm to 0.45 +/- 0.02 cm (mean +/- SEM; P = .002), representing a relative change of +21.6% (median +/- 14%; range, -31 to +67%) during this period. Of the entire cohort, 72% of grafts demonstrated appreciable dilation of the index segment during the first month. Index segment lumen diameter did not change appreciably beyond 1 month, with the notable exception of arm vein conduits, which showed continued tendency to dilate. PWV increased during the first 6 months (17.2 +/- 1.2 m/s to 23.2 +/- 2.4 m/s; P = .008), reflecting a nearly 40% increase in conduit stiffness (2.0 +/- .6 Mdynes/cm to 3.3 +/- .8 Mdynes/cm, P = .01). The greatest relative increase (25%) in PWV occurred from months 1 to 3. Loss of primary patency occurred in 24 cases (19 revisions, 5 occlusions), with a mean reintervention time of 7.6 months. Grafts that demonstrated early positive remodeling (lumen dilatation) had a trend of increased primary patency (P = .08, log rank). Among the grafts that failed, a trend was noted toward greater wall stiffness at 1 month, 2.7 vs 1.5 Mdynes (P = .08).",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy is a less invasive alternative treatment for high-risk patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms. However, this technology alone is often not applicable to complex aneurysmal morphology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of hybrid strategies in high-risk patients who are otherwise unsuitable for endovascular therapy alone.\nDuring an 18-month period, 31 high-risk patients (mean age, 69 years; range, 52-89 years) underwent combined open and endovascular approaches for complex aneurysms, including 16 patients with ascending and arch aneurysms and 15 patients with aneurysms involving visceral vessels. Among them, 11 patients had histories of aneurysm repairs. To overcome the anatomic limitations of endovascular repairs, various adjunctive surgical maneuvers were used, including aortic arch reconstruction in 3 patients, supra-aortic trunk debranching in 13 patients (including 8 patients who required aortas as inflow sources), and visceral vessel bypasses in 15 patients (including 10 patients who required bypasses to all 3 visceral branches). Additionally, carotid artery access was obtained in 1 patient, and iliac artery conduits were created in 12 patients.\nTechnical success was achieved in all patients. There was one perioperative death (3.2%) due to postoperative bleeding. Two patients (6.4%) had immediate type II endoleaks, which were resolved by the 1-month follow-up. Other procedure-related complications occurred in three patients (9.6%), including renal bypass thromboses in two patients and retroperitoneal hematoma, which was successfully managed conservatively, in one patient. During a mean follow-up of 16 months, two patients died of unrelated causes, whereas the remainder of patients were asymptomatic, without aneurysm enlargement.\nOur study highlights how hybrid strategies incorporating surgical and endovascular approaches can be used successfully in treating patients with complex thoracic aortic aneurysms. This combined approach potentially expands the field of endovascular stent grafting and is an attractive solution for patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserves.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the efficacy and safety of autologous bone marrow-mononuclear cells (ABMMNC) implantation in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).\nThe study comprised 28 patients (25 men and 3 women) with a median age of 44 years (range, 25-54 years) who had thromboangiitis obliterans and unilateral critical limb ischemia, defined as ischemic rest pain in a limb with or without nonhealing ulcers. The patients received multiple injections of erythrocyte-depleted and volume-reduced ABMMNC into the gastrocnemius muscle, the intermetatarsal region, and the feet dorsum (n = 26) or forearm (n = 2) vs saline injections into the less ischemic contralateral limbs. The patients were nonresponders to previous Iloprost infusion and smoking cessation >or=6 months and were not candidates for nonsurgical or surgical revascularization. Primary end points were the total healing of the most important lesion while avoiding major or minor amputation, the relief of rest pain without the need for analgesics from baseline to 6 months' follow-up, and the safety and feasibility of the treatment. Secondary end points were the changes in ankle-brachial pressure index and peak walking time, the angiographic evidence of collateral vessel formation or remodeling, and the quality-of-life assessment. Two investigators blinded for treatment assignment performed image analyses.\nUnilateral intramuscular administration of ABMMNC was not associated with any complications. The mean follow-up time was 16.6 +/- 7.8 months (range, 7.6 to 33.8 months). Only one patient required toe amputation during follow-up. A change in the ankle-brachial pressure index >0.15 was achieved in 8 patients at 3 months and in 14 patients at 6 months compared with baseline values. At 6 months, patients demonstrated a significant improvement in rest pain scores (P < .0001), peak walking time (P < .0001), and quality of life (P < .0083). Total healing of the most important lesion was achieved in 15 patients (83%) with ischemic ulcers, and relief of rest pain without the need of narcotic analgesics improved in all patients. Digital subtraction angiography studies before and 6 months after the ABMMNC implantation showed vascular collateral networks had formed across the affected arteries in 22 patients (78.5%).\nABMMNC implantation could be a safe alternative to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans and critical limb ischemia refractory to other treatment modalities.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructions of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are associated with many odd features. Even total occlusions may remain entirely silent or present late with acute symptoms. Renal dysfunction is rare. Many have chronic symptoms, but often only one limb is affected. We describe the clinical features in a series of 120 patients seen over a 10-year period and the results of successful stent placement in 99 limbs.\nPatients with acute onset of symptoms due to distal thromboses underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis. Patients with significant chronic symptoms were investigated by duplex, venous function tests, transfemoral venography and finally intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Stenotic segments were balloon dilated and occluded segments were recannalized when feasible; stents were placed under IVUS control.\nIn the asymptomatic group, 10 patients with total occlusions had transient or no occlusive symptoms. In the acute symptom group, four patients with chronic IVC occlusions presented with acute onset of deep venous thrombosis distal to the occlusion but became asymptomatic when the clot was lysed. In the chronic symptom group, 97 patients (99 limbs) had symptoms of chronic venous disease of variable distribution and intensity. In two-thirds, limb symptoms were unilateral. Pathology was total occlusion in 14%, and the rest were stenoses. The lesion extended above the renal vein in 18%. Common iliac obstruction was concurrent in 93%. Distal reflux was present in 66%. Modifications of the basic stent technique were required in recanalization of total occlusions (four extending up to the atrium), two bilateral stent deployments, and nine IVC filter cases. Stent deployment across the renal and hepatic veins or the contralateral iliac vein had no adverse sequelae. Stent patency (cumulative) at 2 years was 82%. Complete relief (cumulative) of pain and swelling at 3.5 years was 74% and 51%, respectively. The cumulative rate of complete ulcer healing at 2 years was 63%. Overall clinical outcome was rated as good or excellent in 70%.\nThe unusual clinical features of IVC obstructions seem related to the rich collateralization, which has an embryonic basis. Common iliac vein patency seems to be a crucial link in collateral function, and its concurrent occlusion produces symptoms. Percutaneous stent placement has an emerging role in the treatment of IVC obstructive lesions, with good mid-term stent patency and clinical results.",

    "abstract": "When reporting standards for successful lower extremity revascularization were established, it was assumed that arterial reconstruction, patency, and limb salvage would correlate with the ultimate goal of therapy: improved functional performance. In reality, factors determining improvement of ambulation and maintenance of independent living status after revascularization have been poorly studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the important determinants of functional outcome for patients after intervention for critical limb ischemia.\nThe results of 1000 revascularized limbs from 841 patients were studied. Indications were rest pain, 41.1%; ischemic ulceration, 35.6%; gangrene, 23.3%; infrainguinal, 70.9%; aortoiliac, 24.2%; and both, 4.9%. Treatment was by endovascular intervention, 35.5%; open surgery, 61.7%; and both, 2.8%. Patient were mean age of 68 +/- 12 years, and 56.6% were men, 74.7% were white, 54.2% had diabetes mellitus, 67% were smokers, 13.4% had end-stage renal disease and were on dialysis, and 36% had prior vascular surgery. Patients were treated with conventional therapy by fellowship-trained vascular specialists at a single center and were analyzed according to the type of intervention, the arterial level treated, age, race, gender, presentation, the presence of diabetes, smoking history, end-stage renal disease, coronary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous stroke, dementia, prior vascular surgery, preoperative ambulatory status, limb loss <or=1 year of treatment, and independent living status. The technical outcomes of reconstruction patency and limb salvage as well as the functional outcomes of survival, maintenance of ambulation, and independent living status were measured for each variable using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, and differences were assessed using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess independent predictors of outcome and obtain adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.\nAt 5 years, 72.4% of the entire cohort had a patent reconstruction and 72.1% had an intact limb. Overall 5-year functional outcomes were 41.9% for survival, 70.6% for maintenance of ambulation, and 81.3% for independent living status. Outcome was not significantly affected by the type of treatment (endovascular or open surgery) or by the level of disease treated (aortoiliac, infrainguinal, or both). The most important independent, statistically significant predictors of particularly poor functional outcome were impaired ambulatory ability at the time of presentation (70% 5-year mortality, hazard ratio, 3.34; 39.5% failure to eventually ambulate, hazard ratio, 2.83; 30% loss of independent living status, hazard ratio, 7.97), and the presence of dementia (73% late mortality, hazard ratio, 1.57; 41.2% failure to eventually ambulate, hazard ratio, 2.20; 46.4% loss of independent living status, hazard ratio, 5.44). These factors were even more predictive than limb amputation alone.\nFunctional outcome for patients undergoing intervention for critical limb ischemia is not solely determined by the traditional measures of reconstruction patency and limb salvage, but also by certain intrinsic patient comorbidities at the time of presentation. These findings question the benefit of our current approach to critical limb ischemia in functionally impaired, chronically ill patients--patients who undoubtedly will be more prevalent as our population ages.",

    "abstract": "The original Gore Excluder endoprosthesis (OGE) used both during and briefly after clinical trials was associated with less sac regression and more sac growth than some other devices, even without apparent endoleaks, presumably because of transmural movement of serous fluid across the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene material. In July 2004, the device was modified to decrease graft permeability. This study evaluated the efficacy of the new Excluder Low-Permeability Device (ELPD) at 1 year and compared it with the OGE and the Cook Zenith device (ZEN).\nFrom Food and Drug Administration approval of the Excluder in November 2002 until June 2005, 283 patients underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with the Gore Excluder or the ZEN. Postoperative surveillance included computed tomographic scans at 1 and 12 months; 181 (64%) patients completed both scans. The 1-month computed tomographic scan served as a baseline, and the minor axis diameter, measured at the largest axial cut of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, was compared with the same measurement at 1 year. A sac size change of 5 mm or more was considered significant. Sixty patients treated with the OGE were compared with 72 patients treated with the ELPD. Forty-nine patients treated during the same time period with the ZEN, known for early sac shrinkage, were used as a reference. All measurements were performed by one observer from a digital workstation. Wilcoxon signed rank tests (pairwise) or Kruskal-Wallis tests (three groups) were used for intergroup comparison of continuous variables, whereas chi2 statistics or Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables.\nPatient age and sex and mean maximum aneurysm diameter at baseline were similar among groups (P = .59, .27, and .46, respectively). Graft migration, stent fractures, acute surgical conversion, late abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, or aneurysm-related deaths were not observed. Type II endoleak rates were similar between ELPD and ZEN (23.6% and 20.4%; P = .68). Although a higher rate of endoleaks was seen with OGE (36.7%), this was not significant when compared with the other two devices (P = .11). At 1 year, patients treated with ELPD had a sac regression rate that was significantly higher than that for patients treated with OGE (63.9% vs 25%; P < 0.001) and was similar to that for patients treated with ZEN (65.3%). Significant sac expansion was not observed with ELPD.\nAt 1 year, similar to ZEN, significant aneurysm sac regression and minimal sac expansion were noted after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with ELPD. Low-porosity fabric used in the construction of endoprostheses seems to be an important factor in early aneurysm sac shrinkage. Long-term efficacy regarding the prevention of sac enlargement remains unclear, and further follow-up is suggested.",

In this analysis evaluated the clinical outcome <or=15 days of the start of therapy of all enrolled outpatients with acute DVT in the lower limbs.\nDuring the study period, 124 (2.8%) of 4405 DVT patients had at least one adverse event (symptomatic PE, 15; recurrent DVT, 18; major bleeding, 37; death, 68). On multivariate analysis, bilateral DVT, renal insufficiency, body weight <70 kg, recent immobility, chronic heart failure, and cancer were associated with an increased risk for adverse events. When these variables were added into the derivation sample, the area under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.86). Patients with a risk score of <or=2 had a 1.2% incidence of adverse events (23 in 1935 patients) compared with the 6.8% incidence in high-risk patients. In the validation sample, the area under ROC curve was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.88). Low-risk patients had a 1.0% incidence of adverse events, and those at high-risk had a 4.7% incidence.\nA simple risk score based on easily available variables can identify DVT outpatients at low risk for an adverse outcome.

Stent deformation, a phenomenon primarily associated with balloon-expandable stents, is largely avoided by exclusively using self-expanding stents in treating carotid artery stenosis. Nonetheless, we herein report two patients who presented with delayed Wallstent deformation after carotid artery stenting for postendarterectomy restenosis. Our cases highlight the need for caution because delayed deformation of self-expanding stents can occur, particularly during treatment of patients with postendarterectomy stenosis. Furthermore, poststent surveillance is imperative in identifying patients with severe restenosis after carotid artery stenting who need reintervention.",

    "abstract": "We previously described the case of a 47-year-old man who experienced perioperative graft occlusion after infrarenal aortic endarterectomy and aortobifemoral expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass graft for occlusive disease. The patient was treated with local graft thrombolysis and stenting of an intimal flap at the level of the endarterectomized aorta next to the aortic anastomosis. An urgent laparotomy performed 6 years later showed aortic wall perforation by the stent with a large aortoenteric fistula. Surgical treatment included removal of the stent and the aortobifemoral graft, bowel repair, and extra-anatomic lower-limb revascularization by axillofemoral and cross-femoral bypass grafting. The patient was discharged 12 days later with no early complications. Although local thrombolysis and stenting may be a technically feasible technique instead of reoperation in early aortofemoral graft thrombosis, long-term results of this procedure may be affected by perigraft hematoma due to perioperative thrombolysis, increased risk of infection due to the prolonged intragraft cannulation, and risk of stent-related aortic injury, especially if an endarterectomy has been performed. All these issues may increase the risk of late aortoenteric fistula. More experience with hybrid, open/endovascular procedures, and more contemporary stent-based devices is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this alternative treatment.",

This case of tetraplegia occurred in a 64-year-old man with disabling claudication after an aortobifemoral graft repair for occlusive disease associated with a 5-cm infrarenal aneurysm. Magnetic resonance imaging supported lower cervical spinal cord ischemia, an unusual area for ischemia during aortic clamping since this area is usually most resistant. Because the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region, typically T8, is more susceptible to ischemia due to the variable collateral spinal cord circulation, the level of clamping was unlikely to be responsible. Other causes are considered. It was likely to be multifactorial and illustrates the need for great attention to detail in perioperative management and patient consent.",

    "abstract": "ATL-146e protects the spinal cord from ischemia/reperfusion injury, presumably via adenosine A(2A) receptor activation, but this relationship remains unproven. We hypothesized that spinal cord functional and cytoarchitectural preservation from ATL-146e would be lost with simultaneous administration of the specific adenosine A(2A) antagonist ZM241385 (ZM), thus proving that adenosine A(2A) receptor activation is responsible for the protective effects of this compound.\nNew Zealand White rabbits underwent 45 minutes of infrarenal aortic cross-clamping. Groups (n = 10) included sham, ischemia, ischemia plus ATL-146e (ATL-146E), ischemia plus ZM, or ischemia with both compounds (agonist-antagonist). Tarlov scores were recorded every 12 hours. After 48 hours, the spinal cord was fixed for histology and microtubule-associated protein 2 immunohistochemistry.\nTarlov scores at 48 hours were significantly better in the sham and ATL-146E groups (5.0 and 3.9, respectively) compared with the other three groups (all < or =1.3; P < .001). On hematoxylin and eosin, neuronal viability was higher in the sham, ATL-146E, and agonist-antagonist groups compared with the control and ZM groups (P < .05). Microtubule-associated protein 2 expression was preserved in the sham and ATL-146E groups but was lost in the ATL + ZM, ZM241385, and control groups.\nATL-146e preserves the spinal cord in terms of both cytoarchitecture and function after reperfusion of the ischemic spinal cord, but this preservation is not completely blocked by competitive adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonism. Although ATL-146e does seem to partially function through activation of the adenosine A(2A) receptor, the neuroprotective mechanism may not be limited to this particular receptor.",

    "abstract": "The loss of renal function continues to be a frequent complication of the iodinated contrast agents used to perform diagnostic angiography and endovascular procedures. This study examined the hypothesis that contrast-induced renal injury is partly due to a decrease in cortical and medullary microvascular blood flow after the downregulation of endogenous renal cortical and medullary nitric oxide (NO) synthesis.\nAnesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) had microdialysis probes or laser Doppler fibers inserted into the renal cortex to a depth of 2 mm and into the renal medulla to a depth of 4 mm. Laser Doppler blood flow was continuously monitored, and the microdialysis probes were connected to a syringe pump and perfused in vivo at 3 muL/min with lactated Ringer's solution. Dialysate fluid was collected at time zero (basal) and 60 minutes after infusion of either saline or Conray 400 (6 mL/kg). Both groups were treated with saline carrier, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 30 mg/kg), L-arginine (400 mg/kg), or superoxide dismutase (10,000 U/kg), an oxygen-derived free radical scavenger. Dialysate was analyzed for total NO and eicosanoid synthesis. The renal cortex and medulla were analyzed for inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), prostacyclin synthase, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthase content by Western blot analysis.\nConray caused a marked decrease in cortical and medullary blood flow with a concomitant decrease in endogenous cortical NO, PGE(2), and medullary NO synthesis. The addition of L-NAME to the Conray further decreased cortical and medullary blood flow and NO synthesis, which were restored toward control by L-arginine. Neither L-NAME nor L-arginine (added to the Conray) altered cortical or medullary eicosanoids release. Medullary PGE(2) synthesis decreased when superoxide dismutase was added to the Conray treatment, suggesting that oxygen-derived free radicals had a protective role in maintaining endogenous medullary PGE(2) synthesis after Conray treatment. Conray did not significantly alter iNOS, COX-2, prostacyclin synthase, or PGE(2) synthase content.\nThese findings suggest that the downregulation of renal cortical and medullary NO synthesis contributes to the contrast-induced loss of renal cortical and medullary microvascular blood flow. Preservation of normal levels of renal cortical and medullary NO synthesis may help prevent or lessen contrast-induced renal vasoconstriction and lessen contrast-induced renal injury found after diagnostic and therapeutic endovascular procedures.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a sustained-release sheet with vancomycin (VCM) to prevent prosthetic graft infection.\nVCM was incorporated into a poly-L-lactide-co-caprolactone (PLCA) sheet (VCM-PLCA). The release profile of VCM from the VCM-PLCA sheet and the tissue concentration of VCM released in vivo were examined. To assess the antibacterial effect of the VCM-PLCA sheet, a sterile Dacron sheet was implanted into 96 male mice (C57BL/6), who were randomly divided into four groups of 24 each and treated as follows: no treatment (group A, control group), a local bolus injection of an aqueous solution of VCM (group B), a plain PLCA sheet (group C), and a VCM-PLCA sheet (group D). After the treatment, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1 x 10(6) colony forming units) was inoculated onto the Dacron graft surface. The Dacron grafts were retrieved on days 3, 7, 10, and 14 after the implantation, and the number of MRSA in the Dacron grafts was counted.\nVCM was slowly released from the VCM-PLCA sheet over 2 weeks in vivo, and the mean in vivo concentrations of VCM in the tissue around a VCM-PLCA sheet were 7.95, 26.39, 13.87, 12.51, 8.36, and 10.33 mug/mL (the minimum inhibitory concentration of VCM against MRSA is 2.0 mug/ml), at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after the implantation, respectively. MRSA colonization on the cultivated agar plates was detected in all samples from groups A, B, and C at any postoperative time points. In contrast, some samples were negative for bacterial cultures in group D (2, 3, 1, and 2 samples out of 6 samples each on days 3, 7, 10, and 14 after the implantation, respectively). At all time points, the number of MRSA bacteria in the implanted Dacron graft in group D was by far the lowest (P < .01 at each time point).\nThe sustained-release sheet with VCM appears to be effective for the reduction of subcutaneous prosthetic graft infection.",

    "abstract": "Infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) via subcutaneous osmotic pumps into mice promotes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). These AngII-induced AAAs develop via a complex process in which there is a transmedial break, lumen dilation, thrombus formation, inflammation involving cells of both the innate and acquired immune systems, and remodeling. The recent development of a high-frequency ultrasound machine has permitted the noninvasive detection of murine abdominal aortas. We assessed the ability of a Visualsonics Vevo 660 high-resolution imaging system to detect AAAs and sequentially quantify the aortic luminal diameter. This system had 100% accuracy in detecting AngII-induced AAAs in vivo, with intrauser and interuser variation coefficients of less than 10% for quantification of the aortic lumen diameter.\nMale apolipoprotein E (apoE)(-/-) mice were infused subcutaneously with either saline or AngII and were monitored with this ultrasonic system to define the temporal changes in aortic lumen diameter. Aortic luminal diameters were measured in the aneurysm-susceptible region of the suprarenal aorta. For internal controls, abdominal aortic diameters were measured at the level of the left renal branch, because this landmark region did not dilate during AngII infusion.\nLuminal diameters of the suprarenal aorta did not change significantly in saline-infused mice over 28 days of measurement (P = .71). In contrast, AngII infusion led to rapid dilation of suprarenal aortas during the initial 7 days of infusion (0.071 mm/d; P = .0037 for the change in the initial expansion rate). Further luminal diameter expansions occurred for the remaining 21 days of observation at a more modest rate (0.023 mm/d; P = .0001 for continued expansion after day 7). Within the initial 14 days of AngII infusion, some apoE(-/-) mice died as a result of rupture of the aorta in the suprarenal region. We had previously assumed that aortic dilation and rupture occurred simultaneously. However, in the AngII-infused mice that succumbed to aortic rupture, luminal diameters increased several days before death.\nHigh-frequency ultrasonography demonstrated that suprarenal aortic expansion occurs rapidly after the initiation of AngII infusion into apoE(-/-) mice.",

    "abstract": "We explored the role of angiotensin II in determining the histomorphometric features of plaque stability in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice submitted to ligation of the carotid artery.\nSix-month-old apolipoprotein E-deficient mice underwent ligation of the common left carotid artery and were immediately assigned to receive either angiotensin II (1.4 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) subcutaneously) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline; control) via a subcutaneous osmotic minipump for 4 weeks.\nLigated arteries from control animals developed intimal lesions composed of macrophage foam cell plaques, which accumulated adjacent to the internal elastic lamina and were surrounded by a fibromuscular layer. Angiotensin II-treated mice had a greater intimal area (threefold), which was accompanied by a fivefold increase in the foam cell area. Lesions from angiotensin II-treated mice also displayed complex morphology characterized by intralesional neovasculature and hemorrhage. The content of active matrix metalloproteinase 2, mainly colocalized with macrophage foam cells, and the production of the inflammatory mediators monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were also increased by angiotensin II treatment. Although angiotensin II induced vessel expansion and lumen loss to a similar extent, only vessel enlargement correlated with intimal area.\nTaken together, this study's results support a role of angiotensin II in plaque vulnerability by promoting intraplaque neovascularization/hemorrhage, inflammation, and expansive remodeling.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the mid-term (mean, 3.7 years) clinical results and the results of duplex Doppler sonographic examinations of subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) in patients with mild to severe chronic venous insufficiency (clinical class 2-6) and assessed the factors associated with the recurrence of insufficient perforating veins (IPVs).\nEighty patients with mild to severe chronic venous insufficiency undergoing SEPS were evaluated, and duplex findings, as well as clinical severity and disability scores before and after the operation, were compared. Patients with prior deep vein thrombosis (<6 months) or prior SEPS were excluded from this study.\nThere were 27 men and 53 women with a median age of 59.8 years (range, 34.3-80.0 years). The distribution of clinical classes (CEAP) was as follows: class 2, 13.1% (12 limbs); class 3, 22.8% (21 limbs); class 4, 19.6% (18 limbs); class 5, 21.7% (20 limbs); and class 6, 22.8% (21 limbs). The etiology of venous insufficiency was primary valvular incompetence in 83 limbs (90.2%) and secondary disease in 9 limbs (9.8%). Concomitant superficial vein surgery was performed in 89 limbs (95.7%). Twenty (95%) leg ulcers healed spontaneously within 12 weeks after operation, whereas one patient required additional split-thickness skin grafting. Eighteen patients had previous surgery of the great and/or short saphenous vein before SEPS. During a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, recurrence of 22 IPVs was observed in 20 (21.7%) of 92 limbs, and recurrent leg ulcers were observed in 2 (9.5%) of 21 limbs. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to predict factors influencing the recurrence of IPVs (recurrent superficial varicosis, secondary disease, active or healed leg ulcer [C5/6], compression treatment, and previous operation). On multivariate analysis, previous surgery (P = .014) was identified as the only significant factor for the recurrence of IPVs.\nSEPS is a safe and highly effective treatment for IPVs. Within a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, only 2 of 21 venous ulcers recurred, both in patients with secondary disease. Nevertheless, we observed recurrence of IPVs in 21.7% of the operated limbs. On multivariate analysis, patients who had undergone previous surgery were found to have a significantly higher rate of recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasonography assessment of superficial forearm veins is frequently used before a hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is created. There is, however, no standardized preoperative duplex ultrasonography protocol. This study assessed B-mode image analysis reproducibility and reproducibility of repeated forearm superficial venous diameter measurements on different days at different venous congestion pressures (VCPs).\nDiameters were determined using B-mode ultrasonography in 10 healthy male volunteers on days 1 and 14 at incremental VCP values (10 to 80 mm Hg). Intra- and interobserver agreement was assessed for B-mode image analysis by calculating interclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Reproducibility of repeated diameter measurements (maximum and minimum diameter at days 1 and 14), cross-sectional area size increase, and shape change due to incremental VCPs were determined by calculating ICC values.\nAnalysis of intraobserver agreement of B-mode image interpretation yielded ICC values of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.99) for determination of maximum and minimum diameters, respectively. Interobserver agreement analysis yielded ICC values of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.99) for determination of maximum and minimum diameters, respectively. Reproducibility of repeated diameter measurements on days 1 and 14 improved substantially at incremental VCP values, with best reproducibility at VCPs >40 mm Hg. Repeated determination of cross-sectional area size increase and shape change due to VCP increase from 10 to 80 mm Hg yielded ICC values of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.19 to 1.00) and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.92), respectively. Maximum and minimum diameters as well as cross-sectional area size increased significantly (P < .01) due to VCP increase during both sessions. Cross-sectional area shape changed significantly (P < .01) due to VCP increase during both sessions.\nDiameter measurements on B-mode images are largely observer independent. Superficial venous cross-sectional area shape is noncircular, and cross-sectional area size depends on VCP. Both maximum and minimum venous diameters should be determined at VCPs >40 mm Hg to attain the best reproducibility. Further studies are needed to determine whether a standardized preoperative vein mapping protocol can reduce AVF nonmaturation rates.",

    "abstract": "Surgical approaches for forefoot osteomyelitis include amputation with immediate wound closure or resection followed by either staged re-resection and wound closure or local care of the open wound for secondary healing. This study evaluated the effectiveness of closed, staged, and open forefoot amputations in preventing major leg amputation and identified those variables that are associated with successful limb preservation.\nFrom July 2002 to June 2004, 208 patients with forefoot osteomyelitis or gangrene underwent minor amputation according to a standard treatment algorithm. Wounds with limited cellulitis underwent immediate wound closure (CLOSED), wounds with marginally viable soft tissue underwent open amputation followed by wound closure at 2 to 7 days (STAGED), and wounds with tenosynovitis or extensive necrosis underwent d\u00e9bridement with no attempt at wound closure (OPEN). Patient demographics, need for further operative interventions, time to complete healing, and progression to major amputation were recorded.\nWith four subjects lost to follow-up, 204 patients (98%) (94 CLOSED, 56 STAGED, and 54 OPEN) were monitored to complete healing, major amputation, or death. OPEN amputations had a significantly reduced initial healing rate (37%, P < .001) and a frequent need for repeat operative intervention (43%), although successful limb salvage was ultimately achieved in 70% of the cases. Initial healing in the CLOSED and STAGED amputation groups was similar (71% and 78%, respectively), leading to excellent early limb salvage (86% and 91%). The median time to healing for closed, staged, and open amputations was 1.2, 1.6, and 4.6 months, respectively (P < .001). Follow-up evaluation demonstrated the initial improvements in limb salvage with the CLOSED and STAGED groups were lost, resulting in similar amputation rates among the three groups of 30% to 35% over 36 months.\nAlthough open amputation of extensive forefoot infections frequently requires repeat operative interventions and a prolonged time to complete healing, this approach provides limb salvage rates approaching those observed for less invasive infections amenable to immediate closure. Staged closure offers an improved time to healing without negatively impacting the risk of major limb amputation. Independent of their initial operative approach, these patients frequently progress to early leg amputation.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in vascular surgery has focused on development of infection-resistant prosthetic grafts. This article describes the results of a multicenter study to evaluate safety, patency, and infection rates after implantation of the InterGard Silver bifurcated polyester graft coated with collagen and silver.\nBetween October 2000 and February 2002, 289 consecutive patients were implanted with a collagen and silver acetate-coated polyester bifurcated graft at 16 French vascular surgery centers. Mean patient age was 65.3 +/- 10.9 years. The indication for prosthetic bypass was aortic aneurysm in 160 patients (55.4%) and symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease in 129 (44.6%). All but four patients received prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Patency was assessed at 30 days, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, primarily by duplex scan.\nTwo patients (0.7%) died during the first 30 days. Median duration of hospitalization was 11 days. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate at 3 years was 85.7% +/- 4.1%. Primary and secondary patency rates at 3 years were 94.9% +/- 2.6% and 97.5% +/- 1.8%. Thrombectomy was performed successfully in seven patients, and a major amputation was required in two patients with patent grafts. Postoperative complications, including 39 nosocomial infections, were observed in 107 patients (37.0%). Eleven patients presented with 12 wound infections that were classified Szilagyi grade I in eight cases, grade II in two cases, and grade III with graft infection in two cases (0.7%). Among the 149 patients undergoing aortofemoral bypass, eight (5.4%) presented with wound infection, including two graft infections (1.3%). Among the 140 patients undergoing aortoiliac bypass, only three patients (2.1%) presented wound infection and none with graft infection (P = .15). Three (16.7%) of 18 patients who had undergone previous femoral revascularization and eight (3%) of 271 patients without previous femoral revascularization presented with wound infection. This difference was statistically significant (P = .03), with a relative risk of 5.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 19.5). Five (11.9%) of 42 diabetic patients and six (2.4%) of 247 nondiabetic patients presented with wound infection. This difference was also statistically significant (P = .01), with a relative risk of 3.4 (95% CI, 1.7 to 6.9). Lymphorrhea or lymphocele developed in the groin of 25 patients (8.6%) with negative culture.\nThis multicenter prospective study shows that the InterGard Silver graft is safe with no side effects. The primary patency rate was excellent, and the graft infection rate was low, despite a high incidence of nosocomial infections.",

    "abstract": "Although the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its association with smoking in Western populations has been extensively studied, little information is available in China. The objective of this study was to determine the age-standardized prevalence of PAD and examine the relationship between smoking, quitting, and PAD in elderly Chinese.\nWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional study in an urban Beijing sample of 2334 subjects aged > or =60 years (943 men and 1391 women) in 2001 to 2002. PAD was assessed by symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) as measured by the WHO/Rose questionnaire and an ankle-arm systolic blood pressure index (AAI) of <0.90.\nThe prevalence of PAD defined by IC was 11.3% (men, 8.0%; women, 13.6%); 15.3% (men, 11.7%; women, 17.7%) by AAI, and 19.8% (men, 14.7%; women, 23.2%) by both criteria. After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, education, alcohol drinking, exercise, body mass index, and histories of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of PAD for current smokers vs never smokers were 1.54 (1.12 to 2.11) and 1.28 (0.91 to 1.79) for former smokers (stopped smoking for at least 2 years). There was a dose-response relation between the number of cigarettes smoked and increasing risk of PAD. Quitting for > or =10 years nearly eliminated excess risk associated with smoking.\nPAD is common in elderly Chinese and the prevalence is higher in women than in men. About 40% of PAD patients were asymptomatic and unaware of their condition. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for PAD, and smoking cessation substantially reduces the risk.",

    "abstract": "Genes involved in the regulation of immune responses, such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, show genetic variations with potential functional implications. Because atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process apparently modulated by chronic infections, we studied the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR4 and CD14 on the extent of clinically relevant atherosclerosis in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nUsing an in-house-developed polymerase chain reaction-based restriction length polymorphism assay, we determined the genotype, allele frequency, and carrier traits of the TLR4 +896 A>G and the CD14 -260 C>T SNPs in 607 white Dutch patients with PAD. The extent of clinically relevant atherosclerosis was determined on the basis of the number of vascular territories involved, ie, coronary, cerebral, aortic, and peripheral.\nA total of 55% of the patients had PAD only. Approximately one third of the patients had two and 11% had three vascular territories affected by clinically relevant atherosclerosis. The TLR4 +866 G allele frequency was 11%, and the CD14 -260 T allele frequency was approximately 74%. Among PAD patients, TLR4 +896 G allele carriership was univariantly associated with extensive (more than two vascular territories affected) atherosclerotic disease (odds ratio, 2.22; P = .020; chi(2) test), whereas CD14 -260 C>T carriership/homozygosity was not. Trend analysis showed that the TLR4 +866 G allele frequency increased with the number of vascular territories affected by clinically relevant atherosclerosis (P trend, .0074). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis including cardiovascular risk factors and TLR4 and CD14 SNPs, only the interaction variable \"TLR4 +896 G allele carriership/CD14 -260 TT genotype\" survived as an independent predictor of extensive atherosclerotic disease (P = .031; odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-15.4).\nThe carrier trait TLR4 G allele/CD14 TT genotype, rather than each SNP individually, is associated with the extent of clinically relevant atherosclerotic disease. Considering the importance of immune responses in atherogenesis and the genetic variation of immune regulatory genes, our data provide an explanation for interindividual differences in susceptibility to atherosclerosis and demonstrate the need to take a wider approach in analyzing relevant carrier traits instead of individual polymorphisms in relation to atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Premature peripheral vascular disease (PVD), occurring <60 years of age, is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity, limb loss, and death. We hypothesized that different risk factors predict the development of PVD in patients <60 years than in patients > or =60 years.\nTo address this question, we conducted a population-based observational study using the National Health and Nutritional Survey (NHANES) data set, which represents the noninstitutionalized civilian population in the United States. From 1999 to 2002, 5083 participants were analyzed as part of the NHANES survey. PVD status was defined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of <0.9. Putative risk factors for the development of PVD were collected by physical examination, interview, and laboratory testing. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate interactions between age strata and the development of PVD.\nPremature PVD was found in 2.1% +/- 0.2% of the population <60 years, and PVD was found in 12.0% +/- 0.8% of the population > or =60 years. This corresponds to approximately 1.44 million people with premature PVD. Multivariate analysis determined coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.90 vs 1.26, P = .083) and elevated serum fibrinogen (OR 1.07 vs 1.03, P = .034) were stronger predictors of PVD in subjects <60 years than in older subjects. Chronic renal insufficiency (OR 1.02 vs 1.16, P = .006) was more highly predictive of PVD in subjects >60 years. Other significant predictors, irrespective of age, in the multivariate model included hypertension (OR 1.99, P < .001), smoking (OR 2.22, P < .001), and serum homocysteine (OR 1.27, P = .067).\nClinicians should be aware of the high risk of developing premature PVD in patients <60 years with coexisting coronary artery disease or elevated plasma fibrinogen. Routine screening by ABI measurements in high-risk patients would enhance the detection of subclinical premature PVD and allow for secondary intervention.",

    "abstract": "This study is a review and evaluation of our 12-year experience of revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI) with angioplasty/stenting and bypass surgery to identify specific trends of procedure volume and outcomes in this particular group.\nEndovascular and open bypass procedures done for CLI by a single surgeon between 1993 and 2004 were evaluated retrospectively. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy procedures done as the only revascularization procedure were excluded from analysis. The data were divided into three groups by time periods: the first period, 1993 to 1996; the second period, 1997 to 2000; and the third period, 2001 to 2004. Outcomes were defined according to the reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. The study included 416 procedures done in 237 limbs in 192 patients. The mean follow-up was 23 months (range, 1 to 122 months).\nPrimary revascularization procedures for CLI were angioplasty in 153 limbs (65%) and bypass surgery in 84 (35%). Subsequent procedures were angioplasty in 102 limbs (57%) and open surgery (bypass and/or patch angioplasty) in 77 limbs (43%). The rates for technical and clinical success and complications in the entire group were 99%, 95%, and 4%, respectively. One patient died perioperatively (0.5%). Among the three periods, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus lesion types were significantly more severe in patients in the first period (P < .05). Additionally, the complication rate was significantly higher and the mean hospital stay was significantly longer in the first period compared with the second and third periods (P < .05). Furthermore, between the first and third periods, the number of endovascular revascularization procedures done as primary and secondary procedures significantly increased from 15 to 84 (+460%) and from 13 to 57 (+340%), whereas the number of open surgical procedures done as primary and secondary procedures decreased from 39 to 20 (-49%) and from 35 to 18 (-49%), respectively (P < .0001). The assisted primary patency rates in the third period were significantly higher than those in the first and second periods (P = .012); otherwise, the long-term outcomes among the three periods were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis revealed that, while controlling for other factors, the third period showed improvement in the primary patency (P = .032) and assisted primary patency (P = .051), and the bypass group showed improvement in the primary patency (P = .008).\nIn our experience, open surgical procedures for the treatment of CLI have been largely replaced by angioplasty procedures without compromising outcomes. Angioplasty is a feasible, safe, and effective procedure and can be the procedure of choice for the primary and secondary treatment of CLI. Open surgical procedures can be reserved for lesions technically unsuitable for endovascular procedures and patients who do not demonstrate clinical improvement after angioplasty.",

Subsequent procedures were angioplasty in 102 limbs (57%) and open surgery (bypass and/or patch angioplasty) in 77 limbs (43%). The rates for technical and clinical success and complications in the entire group were 99%, 95%, and 4%, respectively. One patient died perioperatively (0.5%). Among the three periods, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus lesion types were significantly more severe in patients in the first period (P < .05). Additionally, the complication rate was significantly higher and the mean hospital stay was significantly longer in the first period compared with the second and third periods (P < .05). Furthermore, between the first and third periods, the number of endovascular revascularization procedures done as primary and secondary procedures significantly increased from 15 to 84 (+460%) and from 13 to 57 (+340%), whereas the number of open surgical procedures done as primary and secondary procedures decreased from 39 to 20 (-49%) and from 35 to 18 (-49%), respectively (P < .0001). The assisted primary patency rates in the third period were significantly higher than those in the first and second periods (P = .012); otherwise, the long-term outcomes among the three periods were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis revealed that, while controlling for other factors, the third period showed improvement in the primary patency (P = .032) and assisted primary patency (P = .051), and the bypass group showed improvement in the primary patency (P = .008).",

    "abstract": "Minimal incision techniques for vein harvest may lessen wound complications after lower extremity revascularization, but long-term patency and limb salvage data are limited.\nThis retrospective case-control study used a computerized vascular registry set in an academic vascular surgical practice. All patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization using autogenous reversed great saphenous vein by a single vascular surgeon in a 10-year period were reviewed. Harvest of great saphenous vein via long single incision (SI) in 133 patients was compared with minimal incisions with endoscopy (MIE) in 85, or MI without endoscopy in 106. The main outcome measures were primary and secondary graft patency by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis and cumulative sum failure (CUSUM). Secondary outcomes of interest were limb salvage and wound complications.\nNo differences were observed between MIE, MI, and SI patients for demographic data, risk factors, or primary indications, including claudication, rest pain, ischemic ulcer, and gangrene. Endoscopic vein harvest patients were significantly more likely than MI or SI to be women and more likely to use tobacco. Primary patency at 5 years was better after SI vein harvest (59%) than with either MI (33%, P = .004) or MIE (44%, P = .045) techniques, although both MI groups had a higher proportion of bypass grafts to the popliteal artery. Similarly, cumulative secondary patency was better after SI (66%) than with MI (47%, P = .045), but not MIE (58%, P = .45). Differences in limb salvage at 5 years in SI (73%) were not statistically superior to either MI (59%, P = .24) or MIE (58%, P = .13). No learning curve for MI or MIE vein grafts was evident by CUSUM for primary patency at 12 months. No differences in wound complication rates were observed for SI (9%), MI (10%), or MIE (6%) grafts (P = .54).\nGraft patency and limb salvage deteriorated during the time when MI or MIE techniques of great saphenous vein harvest were adopted. This observation raises concern about the advisability of limiting the extent of the incision at the potential cost of compromised outcomes without an obvious advantage in limiting wound complications.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of endoscopic vein harvest (EVH) in coronary artery bypass grafting is accepted, few studies have documented the implementation of EVH in peripheral vascular disease surgery. We hypothesized that EVH improves outcomes compared with open vein harvest (OVH) in patients undergoing femoral to below the knee arterial bypass surgery.\nThe charts of 144 consecutive patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery over the course of 27 months were reviewed. A femoral to below the knee arterial bypass with saphenous vein was done in 88 patients (29 had EVH, 59 had OVH). The preoperative characteristics evaluated were age, gender, renal function, history of diabetes, hypertension, tobacco use, and previous infrainguinal bypass surgery on the affected side. End points included wound complications, length of hospital stay, operative time, angiographic and operative interventions for graft occlusion, patency rates, limb salvage, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, and death.\nPatient characteristics and demographics were similar in the EVH and OVH groups. No operative intervention for occlusion was required in the EVH group (0/29) compared with 13.4% in the OVH group (8/59) (P = .03). At the mean follow-up time of 21 months, primary patency rate was 92.8% in the EVH group and 80.6% in the OVH group (P = .12). No significant differences were found between the EVH and OVH groups in postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, operative time, patency rates, limb salvage, and death.\nDespite our initial concerns of damaging the venous conduit with a minimally invasive approach to saphenous vein harvest, EVH in our experience has resulted in a trend toward improved patency rates and decreased infectious wound complications while affording the benefit of improved cosmesis. An endoscopic approach results in smaller incisions, decreased interventions for occlusion, and improved outcomes compared with OVH. EVH is the procedure of choice for harvesting saphenous vein for femoral to below the knee arterial bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Controversy continues about the mere existence of the celiac artery compression syndrome. Earlier results of treatment of unselected patients groups showed varying, mostly disappointing, results. The recently introduced gastric exercise tonometry test is able to identify patients with actual gastrointestinal ischemia. We prospectively studied the use of gastric exercise tonometry as a key criterion for revascularization treatment in patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal complaints and significant stenosis of the celiac artery by compression of the arcuate ligament.\nPatients were prospectively selected using abdominal artery angiography and gastric exercise tonometry. Patients with a significant compression of the celiac artery, typical abdominal complaints, and abnormal tonometry were considered for revascularization.\nOver a 7-year period, 43 patients with significant celiac artery compression were included in this study, and 30 patients were diagnosed as ischemic. Twenty-nine patients had revascularization, 22 (76 %) had a trunk release only. After a median follow-up of 39 months, 83% of patients were free of symptoms. The repeated tonometry after treatment improved in 100% of patients free of symptoms, compared with 25% in patients with persistent complaints after revascularization.\nThe results of this study suggest that the celiac axis compression syndrome exists and that the actual ischemia can be detected by gastric exercise tonometry and treated safely, with success.",

    "abstract": "Recently, carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS) has evolved as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the treatment of carotid occlusive disease. Some concerns have arisen regarding the high cost of stents and neuroprotection devices, which may inflate the overall procedural costs relative to CEA. We report here a review and analysis contrasting the clinical outcomes and associated hospital costs incurred for patients treated with either CAS or CEA.\nNinety-four consecutive patients with surgically amenable carotid stenosis were offered CAS or CEA. Forty-six patients elected CAS, and 48 patients underwent CEA. CAS was performed with the Smart Precise or Acculink stents, and all procedures included neuroprotection (Filter Wire or Accunet). CEA was performed with patients under general anesthesia with routine shunting and with Dacron or bovine pericardium patches. Clinical outcomes such as perioperative mortality, major adverse events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death), length of stay, and the incidence of hemodynamic instability were analyzed. Total costs, indirect costs, and direct procedural costs associated with hospitalization were also reviewed.\nCAS was associated with a shorter length of stay compared with CEA (1.2 vs 2.1 days; P = .02). Differences in perioperative mortality (0% vs 2%; P = NS), major adverse events (2% vs 10%; P = .36), strokes (2% vs 4%; P = NS), myocardial infarctions (0% vs 4%; P = .49), and hypotension necessitating pressor support (21% vs 18%; P = NS) were not statistically significant. By using cost to charge ratio methodology according to the Medicare report, CAS was associated with higher total procedural costs (US dollars 17,402 vs US dollars 12,112; P = .029) and direct costs (US dollars 10,522 vs US dollars 7227; P = .017). The differences in indirect costs were not significant (US dollars 6879 vs US dollars 4885; P = .063).\nCAS with neuroprotection was associated with clinical outcomes equivalent to those with CEA but had higher total hospital costs. These higher costs reflect the addition of expensive devices that have improved the technical success and the clinical outcomes associated with CAS.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy is the standard of care for most patients with severe extracranial carotid bifurcation disease. However, its safety and efficacy in patients with significant surgical risk are unclear. The ARCHeR (ACCULINK for Revascularization of Carotids in High-Risk patients) trial was performed to determine whether carotid artery stenting with embolic protection is a safe and effective alternative to endarterectomy in high-surgical-risk patients.\nThe ARCHeR trial is a series of three sequential, multicenter, nonrandomized, prospective studies. Forty-eight sites enrolled 581 high-surgical-risk patients between May 2000 and September 2003. Patients with severe carotid artery stenosis (angiographically defined, symptomatic > or =50%, or asymptomatic > or =80%) had an ACCULINK nitinol stent implanted. The ACCUNET filter embolic protection system was added to the procedure in the final 2 studies (422 patients). The primary efficacy end point was a composite of periprocedural (< or =30 days) death, stroke, and myocardial infarction, plus ipsilateral stroke between days 31 and 365.\nThe 30-day rate of death/stroke/myocardial infarction was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2%-10.8%), and that of stroke/death was 6.9% (95% CI, 5.0%-9.3%). Most (23/32) strokes were minor, of which more than half (12/23) returned to baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores within 30 days. The 30-day major/fatal stroke rate was 1.5% (95% CI, 0.7%-2.9%). No hemorrhagic strokes were observed in the study. Ipsilateral cerebrovascular accident occurred in 1.3% between 30 days and 1 year, thus giving a primary composite end point of 30-day death/stroke/myocardial infarction plus ipsilateral stroke at 1 year of 9.6% (95% CI, 7.2%-12.0%), which is below the 14.4% historical control comparator. Target lesion revascularization at 12 months and 2 years was 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively.\nThe ARCHeR results demonstrate that extracranial carotid artery stenting with embolic filter protection is not inferior to historical results of endarterectomy and suggest that carotid artery stenting is a safe, durable, and effective alternative in high-surgical-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Aortoenteric fistulas (AEFs) are a rare but often fatal cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Operative repair of AEF has been historically associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality. We reviewed our experience of open surgical and endovascular treatment of AEF to compare outcomes over a contemporaneous time period.\nOver a 9-year period between January 1997 and January 2006, 16 patients (11 men and 5 women) were diagnosed with and treated for AEFs. Seven patients underwent open surgical repair, and nine, with anatomically suitable lesions, underwent endovascular repair. The outcome after treatment of these patients was investigated for survival, perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, and long-term disposition.\nThree primary and 13 secondary AEFs were treated. The mean time from the initial aortic operation until AEF diagnosis was 5.9 years (range, 0.7-12.2 years) for patients with secondary AEFs. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 18.8%. One intraoperative death and one in-hospital death secondary to multisystem organ failure occurred in patients undergoing open repair. One in-hospital death related to persistent sepsis occurred in the endovascular group. The overall perioperative complication rate was 50.0%. Complications in the open group included sepsis, renal failure, bowel obstruction, and pancreatitis. Complications in the endovascular group were related to persistent sepsis. The mean in-hospital length of stay was significantly longer for patients undergoing open repair compared with endovascular repair (44.0 vs 19.4 days; P = .04). Four (80%) of five patients who were discharged from the hospital in the open group were placed in skilled nursing facilities, and seven (87.5%) of eight patients discharged in the endovascular group returned home. The median overall survival after hospital discharge was 23.1 months. There were no late aneurysm-related deaths or late deaths related to septic complications.\nPatients with AEFs have limited overall survival. Endovascular therapy offers an alternative to open surgical repair, seems to be associated with decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality and a shorter in-hospital stay, and allows for acceptable survival given the presence of coexisting medical comorbidities. Furthermore, endovascular repair provides a therapeutic option to control bleeding and allow for continued intervention in a stabilized setting.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is increasingly used. We evaluated if a difference exists in the rate of change of the aortic neck diameter between non-ruptured and ruptured AAAs after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nDetails of patients undergoing elective (group I) and emergency (group II) EVAR using Talent stents between October 1999 and September 2005 were reviewed. Top neck diameters were prospectively recorded on the hospital database from computed tomography scans preoperatively and at 1, 3, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The aortic neck diameter rate of change was calculated for each group.\nEndovascular repair was performed on 110 elective and 41 emergency patients, of which 100 (80 male) elective and 29 (26 male) emergency patients were included in this analysis. Mean age was similar in each group. Stents were oversized by 20.9% +/- 13.6% in group I and by 24.7% +/- 16.3% in group II (P = .37). The preoperative mean proximal aortic neck was larger in group II (25.0 +/- 3.3 mm vs 23.5 +/- 2.8 mm; P = .029). The growth rate of the top neck diameter was significantly greater at 12 months (1.48 +/- 2.4 mm/year vs 3.89 +/- 6.24 mm/year; P = .04) and 24 months (.99 +/- 1.1 mm/year vs 2.61 +/- 3.3 mm/year; P = .04) in group II than in group I. A decreasing sac size was found in 68.2% of patients whose neck dilated. The complication rate was similar in each group.\nAneurysm necks in patients with ruptured aneurysms are larger and dilate at a greater rate than those with nonruptured aneurysms. The accelerated rate of expansion in some patients must be borne in mind during follow-up and in secondary endovascular interventions and conversion to open surgery.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present population-based study was to assess the trends of age- and gender-specific incidence of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA).\nPatients with rAAA from the city of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, were studied between 2000 and 2004. An analysis of trends of incidence and mortality of rAAA in Malm\u00f6 was possible because of a previous population-based study on patients with rAAA between 1971 and 1986 (autopsy rate 85% compared with 25% for the time period 2000 to 2004). The in-hospital registry of Malm\u00f6 University Hospital and the databases at the Department of Pathology, Malm\u00f6, and the Institution of Forensic Medicine, Lund, identified patients with rAAA, and the in-hospital registry identified all elective repairs for AAA.\nCompared with the time period 1971 to 1986, the overall incidence of rAAA significantly increased from 5.6 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4.9 to 6.3) to 10.6 (95% CI, 8.9 to 12.4) per 100,000 person-years (standardized mortality ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.1). In men aged 60 to 69 and 70 to 79 years, the incidence increased significantly from 16 (95% CI, 11 to 21) and 56 (95% CI, 43 to 69) to 46 (95% CI, 28 to 63) and 117 (95% CI, 84 to 149) per 100,000 person-years, respectively, whereas no increase in the age-specific incidence in women could be demonstrated. The overall incidence of elective repair of AAA increased significantly from 3.4 (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.0) to 7.0 (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.4) per 100,000 person-years and increased most significantly from 12 (95% CI, 3.4 to 32) to 68 (95% CI, 34 to 102) per 100,000 person-years in men aged 80 to 89 years and from 5.1 (95% CI, 2.4 to 9.3) to 28 (95% CI, 15 to 41) per 100,000 person-years in women aged 70 to 79 years. The elective-acute repair ratio in women increased from 2.4 to 5.6 and decreased in men from 2.1 to 1.0.\nBetween 1971 to 1986 and 2000 to 2004, the incidence of rAAA increased significantly, despite a 100% increase in elective repairs and notwithstanding a potential for bias towards underestimation due to lower autopsy rates in recent years. The reason behind this increase is unclear, and further studies are needed to identify risk groups for direction of effective prevention and screening.",

    "abstract": "Despite lower reported patency rates than open bypass, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) may result in symptom relief, limb salvage, maintenance of ambulation and independent living, and overall improved quality of life. The goal of this study was to prospectively assess quality of life and functional outcomes after angioplasty and stenting in patients with chronic leg ischemia.\nFrom August to December 2002, 84 patients with 118 chronically ischemic limbs underwent PTA with or without stenting as part of an ongoing prospective project performed to examine management of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. All patients completed a preprocedure health questionnaire (Short Form 36) to provide adequate baseline data. Each patient was followed up every 3 months after treatment for 1 year to determine traditional outcomes of arterial patency, limb salvage, survival and amputation-free survival, and functional outcomes assessed according to improvement in quality of life, maintenance of ambulatory status, and maintenance of independent living status. The entire cohort was analyzed, as were subgroups of patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication and those with critical limb ischemia. Outcomes were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, the log-rank test for survival curves, and the one-sample t test. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine whether presentation and level of disease were independent predictors of outcome.\nOf the 84 patients, 54 (64.3%) were treated for claudication (34 aortoiliac occlusive disease and 20 infrainguinal disease), and 30 (35.7%) were treated for critical limb ischemia (11 aortoiliac occlusive disease and 19 infrainguinal disease). One-year results for the 54 patients with claudication were as follows: primary patency, 78.5%; limb salvage, 100%; amputation-free survival, 96.3%; survival, 96.3%; maintenance of ambulation status, 100%; and maintenance of independence, 100%. There was statistical improvement in all physical function categories, including physical function (29.4 +/- 8.9 vs 37.1 +/- 11.3; P < .0001), role-physical (32.5 +/- 11.3 vs 39.5 +/- 13.0; P = .0001), bodily pain (35.8 +/- 8.5 vs 42.9 +/- 10.9; P < .0001), and aggregate physical scoring (31.1 +/- 9.7 vs 38.1 +/- 11.5; P < .0001). One-year results for the 30 patients with critical limb ischemia were as follows: primary patency, 35.2%; limb salvage, 77.2%; amputation-free survival, 50.0%; survival, 60.0%; maintenance of ambulation status, 75.8%; and maintenance of independence, 92.8%. There was statistical improvement in bodily pain resolution (35.3 +/- 12.0 vs 46.6 +/- 12.0; P = .0009). Cox models with hazard ratios (HRs) revealed that presentation was a significant predictor for outcomes of primary patency (HR, 4.2; P= .0002), secondary patency (HR, 6.0; P < .0001), limb salvage (HR, 20.2; P = .0047), survival (HR, 10.9; P = .0002), and amputation-free survival (HR, 11.2; P < .0001). Conversely, the level of disease was predictive of outcome only for primary patency (HR, 1.8; P = .00289).\nDespite inferior reconstruction patency rates when compared with the historical results of open bypass, PTA provides excellent functional outcomes with good patient satisfaction, especially for treating claudication. These findings support a more liberal use of PTA intervention for patients with vasculogenic claudication.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine the outcome in the United States after endovascular repair (EVAR) of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in patients at high-risk for open surgery by using independently audited, high-compliance, chart-verified data sets, and to compare those results with open surgery.\nHigh-risk was defined to match a recent European trial (EVAR2) and included age of > or =60 years with aneurysm size of > or =5.5 cm, plus at least one cardiac, pulmonary, or renal comorbidity. Data from five multicenter investigational device exemption clinical trials leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval were analyzed. Of 2216 EVAR patients, 565 met the high-risk criteria. Of 342 surgical controls (OPEN), 61 met high-risk criteria. Primary outcome comparisons included AAA-related death, all-cause death, and aneurysm rupture. Secondary measures were endoleak, AAA sac enlargement, and migration.\nAverage age of the high-risk EVAR subset was 76 +/- 7 years vs 74 +/- 6 years OPEN (P = 0.07), mean EVAR AAA size was 6.4 +/- 0.8 cm vs 6.6 +/- 1.0 cm OPEN (P = .33), and average EVAR follow-up was 2.7 years vs 2.5 years OPEN. The 30-day operative mortality was 2.9% in EVAR vs 5.1% in OPEN (P = .32). The AAA-related death rate after EVAR was 3.0% at 1 year and 4.2% at 4 years compared with 5.1% at both time points after OPEN (P = .58). Overall survival at 4 years after EVAR was 56% vs 66% in OPEN (P = .23). After treatment, EVAR successfully prevented rupture in 99.5% at 1 year and in 97.2% at 4 years.\nEndovascular repair of large infrarenal AAAs in anatomically suited high-surgical-risk patients using FDA-approved devices in the United States is safe and provides lasting protection from AAA-related mortality. EVAR mortality remained comparable with OPEN up to 4 years. The decision to treat AAAs in patients with advanced age and significant comorbidities must be individualized and carefully considered, but repair provides excellent protection from AAA-related death.",

    "abstract": "Current treatment modalities for chronic leg ulcers are time consuming, expensive, and only moderately successful. Recent data suggest that creating a subatmospheric pressure by vacuum-assisted closure (V.A.C., KCI Concepts, San Antonio, Texas) therapy supports the wound healing process.\nThe efficacy of vacuum-assisted closure in the treatment of chronic leg ulcers was prospectively studied in a randomized controlled trial in which 60 hospitalized patients with chronic leg ulcers were randomly assigned to either treatment by V.A.C. or therapy with conventional wound care techniques. The primary outcome measure was the time to complete healing (days). Statistical analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat basis.\nThe median time to complete healing was 29 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.5 to 32.5) in the V.A.C. group compared with 45 days (95% CI, 36.2 to 53.8) in the control group (P = .0001). Further, wound bed preparation during V.A.C. therapy was also significantly shorter at 7 days (95% CI 5.7 to 8.3) than during conventional wound care at 17 days (95% CI, 10 to 24, P = .005). The costs of conventional wound care were higher than those of V.A.C. Both groups showed a significant increase in quality of life at the end of therapy and a significant decrease in pain scores at the end of follow-up.\nV.A.C. therapy should be considered as the treatment of choice for chronic leg ulcers owing to its significant advantages in the time to complete healing and wound bed preparation time compared with conventional wound care. Particularly during the preparation stage, V.A.C. therapy appears to be superior to conventional wound care techniques.",

The procedures took place between January 1995 and December 2003. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained for all patients in 2004 to assess changes in CIA diameter. Measurements on preoperative and postoperative CT scans were all made at the same level using the same technique.\nEntered in the study were 147 patients (138 men, 9 women) with a mean age of 68 years. Mean follow-up from aortic surgery to verification of CIA diameter on the postoperative CT scan was 4.8 years. Mean preoperative CIA diameter was 13.6 mm vs 15.2 mm postoperatively. No patient developed occlusive iliac artery disease during follow-up. Three patients (2%) required repeat surgery during follow-up for a CIA aneurysm. The 147 patients were divided into three groups based on preoperative CIA diameter shown in CT scan: group A (n = 59, 40.1%), both CIA were of normal diameter; group B (n = 53, 36.1%), ectasia (diameter between 12 and 18 mm) of at least one CIA; group C (n = 35, 23.8%), an aneurysm (diameter >18 mm) of at least one CIA. CIA diameter increased by a mean of 1 mm (9.4%) over 5.5 years in group A vs 1.7 mm (12.1%) over 4.3 years in group B and 2.3 mm (12.7%) over 4.2 years in group C. The three patients who required repeat surgery for a CIA aneurysm during follow-up were all in group C. Four variables were associated with aneurysmal change in CIA: initial CIA diameter, celiac aorta diameter on the preoperative CT scan, a coexisting aneurysm site, and the follow-up duration.\nTube-graft placement during AAA surgery is justified even for moderate CIA dilatation (<18 mm). CIA aneurysms with a preoperative diameter > or =25 mm enlarge more rapidly and warrant insertion of a bifurcated graft during the same surgical session as AAA repair. The evolutive potential of CIA between 18 mm and 25 mm in diameter justifies a bifurcated graft when the celiac aorta diameter is >25 mm or the patient's life expectancy is > or =8 years.",

    "abstract": "Three main types of anesthesia are used for infrainguinal bypass: general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA), spinal anesthesia (SA), and epidural anesthesia (EA). We analyzed a large clinical database to determine whether the type of anesthesia had any effect on clinical outcomes in lower extremity bypass.\nThis study is an analysis of a prospectively collected database by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) of the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. All patients from 1995 to 2003 in the NSQIP database who underwent infrainguinal arterial bypass were identified via Current Procedural Terminology codes. The 30-day morbidity and mortality outcomes for various types of anesthesia were compared by using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression to control for confounders.\nThe NSQIP database identified 14,788 patients (GETA, 9757 patients; SA, 2848 patients; EA, 2183 patients) who underwent a lower extremity infrainguinal arterial bypass during the study period. Almost all patients (99%) were men, and the mean age was 65.8 years. The type of anesthesia significantly affected graft failure at 30 days. Compared with SA, the odds of graft failure were higher for GETA (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.77; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day graft failure between EA and SA. Regarding cardiac events, defined as postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest, patients with normal functional status (activities of daily living independence) and no history of congestive heart failure or stroke did worse with GETA than with SA (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.32-2.48; P < .0001). There was no statistically significant difference between EA and SA in the incidence of cardiac events. GETA, when compared with SA and EA, was associated with more cases of postoperative pneumonia (odds ratio: 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1-4.4; P = .034]. There was no significant difference between EA and SA with regard to postoperative pneumonia. Compared with SA, GETA was associated with an increased odds of returning to the operating room (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20-1.64; P < .001), as was EA (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31; P = .005). GETA was associated with a longer surgical length of stay on univariate analysis, but not after controlling for confounders. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality among the three groups with univariate or multivariate analyses.\nAlthough GETA is the most common type of anesthesia used in infrainguinal bypasses, our results suggest that it is not the best strategy, because it is associated with significantly worse morbidity than regional techniques.",

Almost all patients (99%) were men, and the mean age was 65.8 years. The type of anesthesia significantly affected graft failure at 30 days. Compared with SA, the odds of graft failure were higher for GETA (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.77; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day graft failure between EA and SA. Regarding cardiac events, defined as postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest, patients with normal functional status (activities of daily living independence) and no history of congestive heart failure or stroke did worse with GETA than with SA (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.32-2.48; P < .0001). There was no statistically significant difference between EA and SA in the incidence of cardiac events. GETA, when compared with SA and EA, was associated with more cases of postoperative pneumonia (odds ratio: 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1-4.4; P = .034]. There was no significant difference between EA and SA with regard to postoperative pneumonia. Compared with SA, GETA was associated with an increased odds of returning to the operating room (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20-1.64; P < .001), as was EA (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31; P = .005). GETA was associated with a longer surgical length of stay on univariate analysis, but not after controlling for confounders. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality among the three groups with univariate or multivariate analyses.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of infrapopliteal bypass when an adjuvant arteriovenous (AV) fistula was reconstructed as means of rescue as a result of poor runoff. The design was a retrospective multicenter case-control study.\nSeventy-seven infrapopliteal vein bypasses required an adjuvant AV fistula among 1813 patients operated on for critical leg ischemia in 3 vascular centers between 1996 and 2003. The mean age was 74 years (range, 39-90 years). A total of 70% of the patients had diabetes, and 24% had undergone previous vascular surgery. In 25% of the bypasses, the distal anastomosis was in a crural artery, in 55% it was in the dorsal pedal artery, and in 20% it was in a plantar artery. An adjuvant AV fistula was reconstructed in all cases because of poor intraoperative arterial status, intraoperative angiography, or low intraoperative flow. A control group was retrieved that matched the study group according to the recipient artery and runoff score.\nThe primary and secondary patency were 61% and 75%, respectively, at 1 year in the AV fistula group and 57% and 71% in the control group. The 3-year patency rates were 49% and 62% for the AV fistula group and 46% and 71% for the control group, respectively. There was a 76% leg-salvage rate at 3 years in the study group, compared with 87% in the control group. There were no major complications related to the AV fistula. Intraoperative flow was increased from a median of 20 mL/min to 115 mL/min by the AV fistula (P = .003). The graft flow was significantly higher in the AV fistula group than in the control group (P = .001).\nThe adjuvant AV fistula increased graft flow significantly in a poor-outflow venous bypass. In this extreme patient group, acceptable patency and leg salvage was achieved without adverse effects. Despite this, the AV fistula did not improve the outcome.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports from select hypertensive patients suggest that atherosclerotic renovascular disease (RVD) is rapidly progressive and associated with a decline in kidney size and kidney function. This prospective, population-based study estimates the incidence of new RVD and progression of established RVD among elderly, free-living participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).\nThe CHS is a multicenter, longitudinal cohort study of cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality among men and women aged >65 years old. From 1995 through 1996, 834 participants underwent renal duplex sonography (RDS) to define the presence or absence of significant RVD. Between 2002 and 2005, a second RDS study was performed in 119 participants (mean study interval, 8.0 +/- 0.8 years). Significant RVD was defined as hemodynamically significant stenosis (renal artery peak systolic velocity [RA-PSV] exceeding 1.8 m/s) or renal artery occlusion. Prevalent RVD was significant RVD at the first RDS, and incident disease was defined as new significant RVD at the second RDS. Significant change of RVD was defined as a change in RA-PSV of greater than two times the standard deviation of expected change over time, regardless of hemodynamic significance or progression to renal artery occlusion.\nThe second RDS study cohort included 119 CHS participants with 235 kidneys (35% men; mean age, 82.8 +/- 3.4). On follow-up, no prevalent RVD (n = 13 kidneys; 6.0%) progressed to occlusion. Twenty-nine kidneys without RVD at the first RDS demonstrated significant change in PSV at the second RDS; including nine kidneys with new significant RVD (8 new stenoses; 1 new occlusion). Controlling for within-subject correlation, the overall estimated change in RVD among all 235 kidneys was 14.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2% to 21.4%), with progression to significant RVD in 4.0% (95% CI, 1.9% to 8.2%). Longitudinal increase in diastolic blood pressure and decrease in renal length were significantly associated with progression to new (ie, incident) significant RVD but not prevalent RVD.\nThis is the first prospective, population-based estimate of incident RVD and progression of prevalent RVD among free-living elderly Americans. In contrast to previous reports among select hypertensive patients, CHS participants with a low rate of clinical hypertension demonstrated a significant change of RVD in only 14.0% of kidneys on follow-up of 8 years (annualized rate, 1.3% per year). Progression to significant RVD was observed in only 4.0% (annualized rate, 0.5% per year), and no prevalent RVD progressed to occlusion.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine whether the different inflation rates of intermittent pneumatic compression systems used in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis influence their hematologic and hemodynamic effects.\nA rapidly inflating intermittent calf compression system and a more gently inflating equivalent were applied to 20 healthy male volunteers for 2 hours each. Venous blood samples were taken for analysis of blood coagulation and fibrinolytic potential. Blood flow velocity was measured in the femoral vein with Doppler ultrasound.\nTissue factor pathway inhibitor significantly increased after the 2 hours of compression for both pumps (78.0 to 85.0 ng/mL rapid, P = .004; 76.5 to 78.0 ng/mL gentle, P = .5), as did plasminogen activator activity (0.85 to 1.05 IU/mL rapid, P = .006; 0.85 to 1.5 IU/mL gentle, P = 0.5). Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity was reduced, although only approaching significance for the gentle system (16.5 to 14.3 AU/mL, P = .06). A D-dimer test for global fibrinolysis showed significant increases for the gently inflating system (97 to 411 ng/mL P < .001) but not for the rapidly inflating system (276 to 350 ng/mL P = .9). The rapidly inflating system produced significantly higher venous peak velocities and augmentations as expected.\nAlthough the data confirm that both types of intermittent compression suppress procoagulant activation, rapid inflation clearly produced no extra benefit in increasing global fibrinolysis, and may be less hematologically effective.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of severe extracranial carotid stenosis in patients with anatomic or clinical factors that increase their risk of complications with surgery, yet there remains a substantial amount of variability and uncertainty in clinical practice in the referral of patients for stenting vs endarterectomy. By undertaking a thorough review of the literature, we sought to better define which subsets of patients with \"high-risk\" features would be likely to preferentially benefit from carotid stenting or carotid endarterectomy. Although only a single randomized trial comparing the outcomes of carotid stenting with distal protection and endarterectomy has been completed, a wealth of observational data was reviewed. Relative to endarterectomy, the results of carotid stenting seem favorable in the setting of several anatomic conditions that render surgery technically difficult, such as restenosis after prior endarterectomy, prior radical neck surgery, and previous radiation therapy involving the neck. The results of stenting are also favorable among patients with severe concomitant cardiac disease. Carotid endarterectomy, alternatively, seems to represent the procedure of choice among patients 80 years of age or older in the absence of other high-risk features. Overall, existing data support the concept that carotid stenting and endarterectomy represent complementary rather than competing modes of therapy. Pending the availability of randomized trial data to help guide procedural selection, which is likely many years away, an objective understanding of existing data is valuable to help select the optimal mode of revascularization therapy for patients with severe carotid artery disease who are at heightened surgical risk.",

A 56-year-old man was brought into the emergency unit of our hospital with massive bleeding from an ulcer on his left calf. A duplex scan and arteriography revealed arteriovenous communication at the site of stasis ulceration. After primary hemostasis, coil embolization of the feeding artery to the arteriovenous communication was successfully performed, followed by stripping of the greater saphenous vein. Careful attention thus needs to be paid to arteriovenous communication that can cause life-threatening bleeding from stasis ulceration. Coil embolization of the feeding arterial branch can safely and effectively treat this disease.",

    "abstract": "An infected pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery in a 69-year-old patient receiving methotrexate therapy was confirmed to have been caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After surgical excision of the aneurysm and revascularization using femoral vein, cutaneous manifestations of M tuberculosis infection in the foot complicated the course. We hypothesized that methotrexate may have triggered the reactivation of dormant tuberculosis in this patient. Because extrapulmonary tuberculous pseudoaneurysms are clinically similar to other types of infected pseudoaneurysm, M tuberculosis infection should always be suspected during the initial diagnosis. We propose that mycobacterial cultures should be routine when initial cultures and Gram stain are negative.",

It often presents as a systemic and multiorgan disease that affects the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and nervous system. Nonspecific signs and symptoms are the hallmarks of PAN. It rarely affects single vessels, although there have been case reports of PAN involving single intra-abdominal vessels. The authors present a case of a 42-year-old white man who presented with mild epigastric pain but was otherwise asymptomatic. The workup ultimately revealed a rare case of an isolated celiac artery aneurysm with a concomitant stenosis of the splenic artery secondary to PAN. The patient was treated with high-dose steroid therapy, with resultant resolution of the vasculitis and a decreased size of the aneurysm.",

The retromandibular position of the aneurysm would have mandated a complex surgical procedure.

A hybrid approach, in which the kink was surgically straightened and the saccular aneurysm coiled after stenting of its orifice, was therefore used to treat this challenging case. A review of the literature supporting this approach is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia is a major obstacle to patency after vein grafting. Despite of a diverse array of trials to prevent it, a satisfactory therapeutic strategy for clinical use has not been established. However, sufficient inhibition of early stages of intimal hyperplasia may prevent this long-term progressive disease. Midkine (MK) is a heparin-binding growth factor that was originally discovered as the product of a retinoic acid-responsive gene. We previously demonstrated that MK-deficient mice exhibit a striking reduction of neointima formation in a restenosis model, which is reversed on systemic MK administration. In this study, we evaluated a strategy of using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MK as a therapy for vein graft failure.\nWe first made a highly effective siRNA to rabbit MK. Jugular vein-to-carotid artery interposition vein grafts, which are applied to a low flow condition, were made in Japanese white rabbits. Small interfering RNA mixed with atelocollagen was administrated to the external wall of grafted veins. Cy3-conjugated stabilized siRNA was used to confirm its stability and successful transfer into the vein graft wall. Neointimal hyperplasia was evaluated 4 weeks after the operation. The proliferation index and leukocyte infiltration were determined.\nMK expression was induced and reached the maximum level 7 days after operation. Fluorescence of Cy3-labeled siRNA could be detected in the graft wall even 7 days after operation. Knockdown of the gradually increasing expression was achieved by perivascular application of siRNA using atelocollagen. The intima-media ratio and the intima thickness at 28 days after grafting were both reduced >90% by this treatment compared with controls. This phenomenon was preceded by significant reductions of inflammatory cell recruitment to the vessel walls and subsequent cell proliferation in MK siRNA-treated grafts.\nThese results suggest that midkine is a candidate molecular target for preventing vein graft failure. Furthermore, for clinical applications of siRNA, a single intraoperative atelocollagen-based nonviral delivery method could be a reliable approach to achieve maximal function of siRNA in vivo. This strategy may be a useful and practical form of gene therapy against human vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Vein wall injury after thrombosis is multifactorial but seems dependent on thrombus and local thrombotic and inflammatory mechanisms. We hypothesized that inhibition of vein wall injury through reduction of thrombotic and inflammatory events with P-selectin inhibition and/or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) occurs independently of thrombus resolution in a rat model of venous thrombosis.\nMale rats underwent inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis (94.4% +/- 0.5% reduction in IVC diameter) to induce thrombosis. Rats were treated from 2 days after thrombosis until they were killed 7 days later. Groups consisted of (1) PSI-697, a P-selectin inhibitor (30 mg/kg; oral gavage daily); (2) LMWH-Lovenox (LOV; enoxaparin) 3 mg/kg subcutaneously daily; (3) PSI-697 (30 mg/kg; oral gavage daily) plus LOV 3 mg/kg subcutaneously daily (PSI + LOV); (4) and untreated controls. Evaluations included thrombus mass, vein wall tensiometry (stiffness [inverse of compliance]), intimal thickness scoring by light microscopy, vein wall inflammatory mediators by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and vein wall inflammatory cells by histologic evaluation.\nThrombus mass was not reduced by any treatment. Animals treated with PSI-697 alone, LOV alone, or PSI + LOV demonstrated significant decreases in vein wall stiffness when compared with controls. The vein wall stiffness of the PSI-697-treated groups was also significantly lower than in the LOV-only group. Animals treated with PSI-697 showed a significantly decreased intimal thickness score when compared with vehicle control IVCs. Vein wall intimal thickening was also significantly decreased in animals treated with PSI-697 vs LOV. The PSI-697 and PSI + LOV groups manifested significant decreases in the immunoregulatory and inflammatory cytokine interleukin 13 as compared with controls and LOV. Vein wall monocyte chemotactic protein 1 levels were also significantly reduced in the PSI-697 and PSI + LOV groups vs control. Only PSI-697 significantly decreased vein wall levels of platelet-derived growth factor betabeta. Both the LOV and PSI + LOV groups had significant increases in vein wall monocytes and total inflammatory cells vs controls.\nThese data suggest that both LMWH and PSI-697 inhibit vein wall injury independently of thrombus mass. P-selectin inhibition seemed superior to LMWH in measured parameters of injury and mediator inhibition.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the current clinical experience of temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement and its related complications.\nFrom January 2000 to December 2005, we enrolled 33 patients (8 men and 25 women) who underwent percutaneous insertion of a temporary IVC filter in the Department of Vascular Surgery of Tokyo University Hospital. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was proven in 78.8% of the patients. The indications for filter insertion were contraindication to anticoagulation therapy (9.1%), thrombolytic therapy (12.1%), perioperative prophylactic implantation (84.8%), pregnancy with DVT (3.0%), and prophylactic implantation in the absence of DVT (15.2%). A Neuhaus Protect was used in 13 patients, and an Antheor was used in 20 patients.\nThe mean +/- SD duration of filter placement was 10.6 +/- 7.0 days. There was no case of pulmonary embolism during filter protection and retraction. Filter thrombosis (capture of thrombus) was observed in four patients (12.1%), who then received additional thrombolytic therapy. Thrombi were dissolved by thrombolysis in three, one of whom had replacement with a permanent filter. The thrombus was not dissolved in one patient and was removed under venotomy at the insertion site. Major filter-related complications occurred in nine patients (27.3%), including filter dislocation in four patients (12.1%), catheter fracture in three (9.1%), and catheter-related infection in one (3.0%). In a patient with giant ovarian cancer, the IVC was nearly occluded with massive thrombus around the filter 2 days after operation, and the vena cava was then ligated under open laparotomy. No patients died during filter protection and retraction.\nTemporary IVC filters were effective for the prevention of fatal pulmonary embolism. However, our experience of a high incidence of complications related to temporary filters suggests that this device has limited indications and supports the need for innovative design of temporary filters.",

    "abstract": "A large tortuous vein coursing over the posterior aspect of the knee and the upper calf may give rise to a constellation of varicose veins unrelated to the great (GSV) or small (SSV) saphenous veins. Designated the popliteal fossa vein (PFV), it perforates the deep popliteal fascia and empties into the deep system. We examined the prevalence, anatomic reflux patterns, hemodynamic role, and clinical significance of the PFV.\nWe examined 543 patients (818 limbs) with venous disease, aged 14 to 94 years (median, 55 years). The study consisted of group A, comprising limbs with a PFV, and group B, formed by the remaining limbs. The history, clinical examination, and venous duplex scan findings were analyzed retrospectively. Venous clinical severity and venous segmental disease scores of group A were compared with those of an equal number of CEAP-, sex-, and age-matched control limbs. In situ venous hemodynamics of the PFV obtained with duplex scan are reported.\nA PFV was found in 24 (2.93%) of 818 limbs (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-4.1%); 24 (4.4%) of 543 subjects (95% CI, 2.7%-6.2%), 12 men and 12 women aged 23 to 82 years (median, 54 years) had a PFV. CEAP clinical classes in limbs with a PFV were as follows: C2, 15 limbs; C3, 5 limbs; C4, 2 limbs; C5, 1 limb; and C6, 1 limb. Proximal and distal (92%), superficial (100%), perforator (87.5%), and complex-pattern (41.7%) reflux occurred more often in group A (P < .01). Incompetence in the GSV (75%), posterior arch, and posteromedial and saphenous tributaries was also more frequent in group A (P < .05). SSV reflux in group A (29%) matched that in group B. The PFV terminated at the deep system (96% in the popliteal vein) above the SSV (median distance, 1.5 cm; 95% CI, 0.5-2 cm). The odds ratio for a PFV in limbs with prior SSV disconnection was 5.68. Deep reflux was evenly distributed in group A (41.7%) and group B (27%). The prevalence of incompetent perforators was 283% (95% CI, 194%-373%) in group A and 96% (95% CI, 95%-98%) in group B (P < .001). PFV tributaries were distributed at the popliteal area (100%); the posterior (87.5%), medial (62.5%), and lateral (37.5%) upper calf; and the posterior distal thigh (17%), often projecting to the posterior GSV arch (50%). The (median) peak velocity of reflux in the PFV was 82.6 cm/s, the mean velocity was 17.7 cm/s, the duration was 2.4 seconds, the volume flow was 231.5 mL/min, and the expelled volume was 9.3 mL. The median diameter of the PFV at the crossing of the fascia was 0.527 cm. Venous clinical severity (range, 2-17; median, 5.5) and venous segmental disease (range, 0.5-8; median, 2.75) scores in limbs with a PFV exceeded (P <or= .04) those of the control limbs.\nWith a prevalence of 4.4%, the PFV presents in limbs featuring complex reflux patterns involving all three venous systems proximally and distally. Limbs with a PFV have a higher propensity for GSV and superficial tributary reflux and have perforator vein incompetence three times more often than limbs without this vein. The PFV perforates the deep popliteal fascia terminating at the deep system (ie, the popliteal vein in 96%) distinctly above the SSV. In light of its reflux dynamics, nearing or exceeding those of severely impaired perforator veins, and the complex patterns of reflux (venous segmental disease) and venous clinical severity (high venous clinical severity scores) of the affected limbs, clinical and investigational awareness of the PFV is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Superficial venous surgery (SVS) results in a significant improvement in generic health-related quality of life (HRQL). However, it is unclear how this improvement compares with that observed after other commonly performed general and vascular operations. The aim of this study was to compare the changes in generic HRQL observed before and after SVS for CEAP clinical grade 2 to 4 venous disease with those observed before and after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) for biliary colic.\nThe Short Form 12 questionnaire was mailed to patients before and 3, 6, and 12 months after SVS (n = 143) and ELC (n = 60). The responses were used to calculate physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores at each time point. A higher score indicates a better HRQL.\nBefore surgery and 3 and 12 months after surgery, patients in the ELC group had a significantly lower PCS than those in the SVS group (40.2 vs 49.5, 48.9 vs 53.1, and 45.4 vs 53.8; P < .001, P = .033, and P < .001, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test). However, the change in PCS observed over the first 12 postoperative months was not significantly different between the SVS and ELC groups. Patients in the ELC group had a significantly lower MCS than those in the SVS group before surgery (45.9 vs 50.8; P = .002; Mann-Whitney U test), but not after surgery. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of postoperative change in MCS.\nSVS is associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in generic HRQL that is similar to that observed after ELC. These novel data lend further support to the clinical benefit of SVS and will help health care purchasers make decisions regarding the prioritization of vascular and general surgical services.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous ablation of the great saphenous vein (GSV) may be performed simultaneously with stab phlebectomy of branch varicose veins or as a stand-alone procedure. A clinical approach of performing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) alone as initial treatment for varicose veins was reviewed.\nPatients with duplex ultrasound-documented reflux in the GSV and CEAP clinical stage 2 to 6 were selected for RFA. Patients were examined within a week preoperatively with duplex ultrasound imaging. Patients were seen within a week postoperatively and again at 2 to 3 months to ascertain if further treatment was required. A retrospective review of the initial 184 procedures in a series from June 2002 through February 2005 was performed, allowing for a 9-month follow-up period.\nThree procedures were performed under general anesthesia and 181 with intravenous sedation and tumescent anesthesia. Postoperative duplex scans showed total occlusion or partial patency of <10 cm in 155 limbs. Seven (4.5%) had concomitant stab phlebectomy, seven subsequently had sclerotherapy, and 39 (25.2%) underwent subsequent stab phlebectomy of persistent symptomatic varicosities. In 101 limbs (65.1%), symptoms resolved and had no further therapy, and 24 limbs had a GSV that was patent for >10 cm on postoperative duplex imaging. Nine limbs had no further therapy (37.5%), eight (33.3%) had subsequent stab phlebectomy, and three had stripping of the GSV and stab phlebectomy. Four limbs had a redo RFA, four limbs had an aborted RFA procedure, and one limb was lost to follow-up. Failure of total GSV occlusion was more often associated with use of a 6F catheter. Complications were generally mild, and there was no postoperative deep vein thrombosis.\nEndovenous ablation of the GSV can be performed safely and effectively as the initial treatment for lower extremity varicose veins.

    "abstract": "Compression of the left common iliac vein (LCIV) by the right common iliac artery is an anatomic variant that may increase the risk for LCIV thrombosis. The incidence of LCIV compression in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is unknown, however. The aim of this descriptive anatomic study was to determine (1) the incidence of LCIV compression in patients with and without AAA and (2) if endovascular AAA repair acutely alters the incidence of LCIV compression and, hence, the risk of LCIV thrombosis.\nA retrospective analysis of medical records and helical computed tomography (CT) scans was conducted in 100 AAA patients and 100 non-AAA patients (n = 200). Medical records were reviewed for symptoms and risk factors for deep vein thrombosis, and data were reported according to the Joint Society Reporting Standards for acute lower-extremity venous thrombosis. The minor diameters of the aorta, inferior vena cava, and common iliac arteries and veins were measured. For AAA patients, measurements were obtained from preoperative and 30-day postoperative CT scans.\nThe mean age of the study cohort was 38 years (range, 17 to 85 years) for non-AAA subjects and 73 years (range, 51 to 89 years) for AAA subjects. The mean acute lower-extremity venous thrombosis risk factor score was low for both patient groups (non-AAA, 0.82 +/- 0.12; AAA, 2.63 +/- 0.14). Mean compression of the LCIV was 37.8% (range, 0% to 74.8%) for non-AAA patients but only 27.3% (range, 0% to 74.2%; P < .0006) for AAA patients. Of non-AAA patients with venous compression, the right common iliac artery was the compressing structure in 87% of cases. However, of AAA patients with venous compression, the left common iliac artery was the compressing structure in 76% of cases. There was no statistically significant change in the degree of compression of the LCIV before and after endovascular repair (27.3% vs 25.1%, respectively) nor was there a change in the structure that compressed the LCIV.\nPatients with AAA were found to have more tortuous iliac arteries that led to less anatomic compression of the LCIV compared with nonaneurysmal patients. Furthermore, the left common iliac artery was found to compress the LCIV in most of the AAA patients, and the right iliac artery was found to compress the LCIV in most non-AAA patients. Endovascular AAA repair did not acutely alter these anatomic findings. Patients with AAA may therefore be at lower risk of developing LCIV thrombosis owing to the nature of their anatomy.",

Of non-AAA patients with venous compression, the right common iliac artery was the compressing structure in 87% of cases. However, of AAA patients with venous compression, the left common iliac artery was the compressing structure in 76% of cases. There was no statistically significant change in the degree of compression of the LCIV before and after endovascular repair (27.3% vs 25.1%, respectively) nor was there a change in the structure that compressed the LCIV.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and profile of patients presenting with chronic venous insufficiency (class C3-C6) and cascading deep venous reflux involving femoral, popliteal, and crural veins to the ankle.\nFrom September 2001 to April 2004, 2,894 patients were referred to our center for possible venous disorders. The superficial, deep, and perforator veins of both legs were investigated with color duplex scanning. The criterion for inclusion in this study was the existence of cascading deep venous reflux involving the femoral, popliteal, and crural veins to the ankle whose duration had to be longer than 1 second for the femoropopliteal vein and longer than 0.5 seconds for the crural vein. The advanced CEAP classification, the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), the Venous Segmental Disease Score (reflux; VSDS), and the Venous Disability Score (VDS) were used.\nSeventy-one limbs in 60 patients were identified. Eleven limbs (15.5%) were classified as C3, 36 (50.7%) as C4, 21 (29.6%) as C5, and 3 (4.2%) as C6. A primary etiology was identified in 11 (15.5%) limbs, and a postthrombotic etiology was identified in 60 limbs (84.5%). In the latter group, all but four patients were aware that they had had a previous deep venous thrombosis. In addition to femoropopliteal and calf veins, reflux was present in the common femoral vein in 60 (84.5%), the deep femoral vein in 27 (38%), and the muscular calf veins in 62 (87.3%). Incompetent perforator veins were identified in 53 (74.6%) limbs. Fifty-one (71.8%) limbs had a combination of superficial venous insufficiency (AS(2), AS(2,3), AS(4), or their combination) previously treated or present. Of these, 11 had primary etiology alone, and 40 had a secondary etiology with or without primary disease. Means and 95% confidence intervals of the VCSS, VSDS, and VDS were 9.72 (8.91-10.53), 7.2 (6.97-7.42), and 1.08 (0.83-1.32), respectively. A significant increase in the VCSS and in the VSDS (P < .0001) paralleled the CEAP clinical class. The VDS was higher in the C3 and C6 classes but did not reach significance. There was a significant link between the pain magnitude in the VCSS and the VDS (P < .0001). Severity of pain and high VDS did not depend on the wearing of elastic compression stockings. VCSS increased significantly according to the presence of an incompetent perforator vein (P < .05) and/or reflux in the deep femoral vein (P < .05).\nThis study confirmed the value of the Venous Severity Score as an instrument for evaluation of chronic venous insufficiency. A significant increase in the VCSS and VSDS paralleled CEAP clinical class; VDS was higher in classes C3 and C6 without reaching significance, probably because of the small size of the samples. Some clinical and anatomic features need to be clarified to facilitate scoring.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology underlying the skin changes seen in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is multifactorial. Sedentary lifestyle and prolonged sitting and standing at work have been proposed by some authors to be influential in the development of CVI skin changes. This study compared the 24-hour activity profiles in patients with different clinical severities of CVI and normal controls.\nPatients were classified into groups according to CEAP clinical severity classes: mild (C2&C3), moderate (C4) and severe (C5&C6). Activity profiles were measured in 60 patients and 15 controls using a Newcastle Universities Medical Activity (NUMACT) monitor, which recorded the duration spent in supine, sitting, and standing postures as well as duration spent walking and the walking intensity over a 24-hour period. Analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests and Spearman correlation.\nWalking intensity was significantly different between the controls and patient groups during prolonged walking (P < .001). The controls spent significantly more time standing in a 24-hour period than any of the CVI clinical groups (P = .036), and the percentage time spent sitting was significantly higher in the patient groups (P = .025). No significant differences were found in the total number of steps taken or total duration spent walking in the 24-hour period between any of the groups.\nThis study shows that walking intensity is lower in the more severe clinical groups and may be influenced by the clinical severity of CVI. The study provides evidence that prolonged sitting and reduced standing is associated with increased severity of CVI, which may by an effect of the patient's symptoms rather than a cause of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this retrospective study was to present 7 years of data from operations of currently active, chronic venous leg ulcers (CEAP: C6), focusing on the short- and long-term effects of healing and recurrence and considering concomitant risk factors.\nBetween January 1997 and March 2004, 173 patients (239 legs) with a currently active, chronic venous leg ulcer were surgically treated. The surgical procedures included two main steps: (1) the surgical interruption of reflux in the superficial and perforating veins to reduce venous hypertension in the entire leg and/or the affected area and (2) the surgical procedure involving the ulcer. A total of 123 patients (173 legs) who came to the follow-up were examined. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 7 years. The data collection integrated a preoperative examination that included medical history and clinical diagnoses and incorporated measurements such as body mass index, ankle-brachial pressure index, and the neutral position method at the follow-up. The function of the veins was measured with duplex ultrasonography. Finally, the data were analyzed by using various statistical methods, including Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression analysis, and paired t tests.\nInitially, ulcer healing occurred in 87% of the cases (151 legs). A total of 13% (22 legs) of the venous ulcers never healed, and recurrent venous ulcers occurred in 5% (9 legs). The Kaplan-Meier analyses of ulcer healing showed a healing rate of 85% in 6 months for all legs. The mean time of healing was 1.5 months. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier analyses of ulcer recurrence showed a 1.7% rate of recurrence in 6 months for all legs. The 5-year ulcer recurrence rate was 4.6%. The mean time of recurrence was 70.4 months.\nOn the basis of the results from the 7 years of data from functional surgery of venous leg ulcers and as a result of the outcomes of our study, we recommend surgical treatment of venous leg ulcers at any stage. We therefore conclude that surgery is indicated before an ulcer is intractable to treatment. In general, our findings are based on the understanding and identification of the causes and symptoms of venous ulceration and illustrate that standard surgical methods can be applied for the therapy of venous leg ulcers at any stage.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of venous leg ulcers is as high as 1% to 1.5%, and the total costs of this disease are 1% of the total annual health care budget in Western European countries. Treatment modalities are conservative or surgical. Subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) combined with superficial vein ligation is performed in many centers to address vein incompetence in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers. Several reports describe good healing and low recurrence rates, although a randomized trial to compare surgical treatment including SEPS and treatment of the superficial venous system to conservative modalities has never been performed. Therefore, a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted to study whether ambulatory compression therapy with venous surgery is a better treatment than just ambulatory compression therapy in venous leg ulcer patients.\nPatients with an active (open) venous leg ulcer (CEAP C6) qualified for the study. The study consisted of two treatment groups. All patients were treated by standardized ambulatory compression therapy, and half of the patients received SEPS. Concomitant superficial venous incompetence was also treated in the second group. For allocation to both treatment groups, each patient was assigned by a computer program at the randomization center. The primary goal of the study was to compare the ulcer-free period during follow-up in both study groups. Secondary end points were ulcer healing and recurrence rates.\nFrom April 1997 until January 2001, 200 ulcerated legs (170 patients) were included in the study in 12 centers in The Netherlands. A total of 97 ulcers were allocated to the surgical group and 103 to the conservative group. Patient characteristics were similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, with the exception of a higher proportion in the conservative group of diabetes mellitus. Healing rates were 83% in the surgical group and 73% in the conservative group (not significant; median time to healing, 27 months). Recurrence rates were the same in both treatment groups (22% surgical vs 23% conservative). During follow-up of a mean of 29 months (median, 27 months) in the surgical group and 26 months (median, 24 months) in the conservative group, we found that in the surgical group, the ulcer-free rate was 72%, whereas in the conservative group this rate was 53% (P = .11; Mann-Whitney test). Patients with recurrent ulceration or medially located ulcers in the surgical group had a longer ulcer-free period than those treated in the conservative group (P = .02 for both). A first-time ulcer and one of the centers also had a positive effect on the ulcer-free period during follow-up (P < .001 and P = .02), independent of the treatment group. Deep vein incompetence did not affect the ulcer-free period.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that patients with medial and/or recurrent ulceration should receive surgery combined with ambulatory compression therapy. A dedicated center should provide care for those patients.",

    "abstract": "Role of superficial venous surgery in reducing the time it takes for ulcers to heal is still controversial, although all studies confirm a significant reduction in ulcer recurrences. Recently, the HFE-C282Y and FXIII-V34L gene variants demonstrated a role in the risk of venous ulceration in primary chronic venous disorder (CVD) and in modulating lesion size in chronic venous ulcer (CVU), respectively. This study was conducted to investigate the role of HFE-C282Y and FXIII (V34L and P564L) gene variants in ulcer healing time after superficial venous surgery, by assessing the outcome of a cohort of homogeneous CVU patients.\nThe study selected 91 patients affected by primary CVU (CEAP C6, Ep, Asp, Pr), with the exclusion of any other comorbidity factor involved in delayed healing process, who underwent surgery. We assessed the ulcer area and the healing time. Patients were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction for FXIII (V34L and P564L) and for HFE-C282Y substitutions.\nGlobally, CVU cases had a postoperative mean healing time of 8.5 +/- 5.7 weeks. For the subset of cases above and below the median value (M = 8.0 weeks), FXIII-V34L genotype distribution significantly differed (P < .0001). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded specific healing time profiles for the different FXIII-V34L classes of genotype (P = .00001), with an increased risk of delayed healing for the FXIII-VV genotype (hazard ratio, 4.14; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 8.2; P = .00005). Although FXIII-P54L genotype distributions did not differ, homozygous 564LL cases (P = .005) and double carriers for both FXIII variants (P < .0001), had a significantly reduced healing time vs wild types. No differences in healing time were observed between carriers and noncarriers of the HFE-C282Y variant, whereas when these cases were stratified by FXIII-V34L genotypes, the L34 carriers had a significantly shorter healing time, irrespective of the HFE genotype.\nThe FXIII-34L variant was significantly associated with shorter healing time after superficial venous surgery, suggesting a role in the healing and tissue regeneration phases. Conversely, HFE-C282Y, despite its role in ulcer establishment, did not affect the postoperative healing time. In perspective, the identification of patients with a poor prognosis may give clinicians the opportunity to modify management and to target tailored therapies in the view of a new and alternative concept of treatment based on pharmacogenomics.",

Conversely, HFE-C282Y, despite its role in ulcer establishment, did not affect the postoperative healing time. In perspective, the identification of patients with a poor prognosis may give clinicians the opportunity to modify management and to target tailored therapies in the view of a new and alternative concept of treatment based on pharmacogenomics.",

In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded specific healing time profiles for the different FXIII-V34L classes of genotype (P = .00001), with an increased risk of delayed healing for the FXIII-VV genotype (hazard ratio, 4.14; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 8.2; P = .00005). Although FXIII-P54L genotype distributions did not differ, homozygous 564LL cases (P = .005) and double carriers for both FXIII variants (P < .0001), had a significantly reduced healing time vs wild types. No differences in healing time were observed between carriers and noncarriers of the HFE-C282Y variant, whereas when these cases were stratified by FXIII-V34L genotypes, the L34 carriers had a significantly shorter healing time, irrespective of the HFE genotype.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the clinical risk factors for the development of leg length discrepancy (LLD) in patients with congenital vascular malformation (CVM) affecting the lower extremity.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted of a prospectively collected database that included 361 patients who underwent assessment of a CVM lesion from September 1994 to January 2005. We measured LLD using lower extremity scanograms of 229 patients who were suspected of having LLD on physical examination. The risk factor analysis for a clinically significant LLD (>2 cm) was performed with the variables of age, gender, features of CVM (type, extent and depth), and the deep vein status (agenesis, hypoplasia, phlebectasia) of the affected limb. Fisher's exact test and the chi(2) test were used for the univariate analysis, and a logistic regression test was performed for the multivariate analysis. Among the patients with LLD, we compared the overgrowth group and undergrowth group with the Fisher's exact test to identify differences between the two subgroups.\nThe included patients were 153 males (42%) and 208 females (57%) with a mean age of 20 +/- 14 years (range, 1 to 62). There were 157 patients (43%) in the still growing age group (age <15 years) and 204 (57%) were in the finished growing age group (age >15 years). The types of CVMs included 215 venous (60%), 43 arteriovenous (12%), 46 lymphatic (13%), and 57 (16%) combined venolymphatic malformations. On the lower extremity scanogram, 26 patients (7%) had a LLD of >2 cm due to overgrowth (n = 20) or undergrowth (n = 6) of the affected limbs. The univariate analysis showed that a venolymphatic malformation (P = .003) and a whole leg CVM (P = .000) were significant risk factors for development of LLD. However, the multivariate analysis identified the whole leg CVM lesion as a single independent risk factor for LLD (P = .004; odds ratio, 6.512, 95% confidence interval, 1.788 to 23.713). On subgroup analysis, a whole leg CVM was also identified as a risk factor for overgrowth of the affected limb. In a comparison between two subgroups of LLD (overgrowth v. undergrowth), overgrowth was significantly (P = .022) more common in female than in male patients.\nAs a clinical risk factor for development of LLD, the extent of the CVM lesion was a single independent risk factor regardless of the type or depth of the CVM lesion. In addition, our data suggest that overgrowth or undergrowth of the affected limb, as a cause of LLD, might be related to gender.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of surgical reconstruction of the renal artery after complicated or failed percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA).\nThis was a retrospective study of 45 consecutive patients who were referred to our centers for surgical renal artery reconstruction after 52 complicated or failed PTRA procedures performed between 1980 and 2003. There were 27 women and 18 men, with a median patient age of 28 years (25th percentile, 13.5 years; 75th percentile, 59.5 years). The mean number of PTRA per artery per patient was 1.4 +/- 0.6. Renal artery stenosis was due to arterial fibrodysplasia in 25 patients, atherosclerosis in 17, and inflammatory arteritis in three.\nForty-eight renal artery revascularizations were performed (3 bilateral). The procedure consisted of in situ surgery in 38 patients (79%) and extracorporeal repair in 10 (21%). Primary nephrectomy was required in three patients. One patient did not undergo surgical repair after failed PTRA because of kidney atrophy. Major technical problems were encountered during surgical revascularization in 14 (74%) of the 19 patients treated after complicated PTRA and in four (12%) of the 33 patients treated after failed PTRA. Multiple organ failure led to one death on postoperative day 90 in a patient with atherosclerosis and severe kidney insufficiency. Postoperative thrombosis of the repaired renal artery led to kidney loss in three patients, but only one patient required secondary nephrectomy. Primary patency for the overall series of renal revascularizations was 93.5% +/- 6.5% at 5 years.\nSurgical reconstruction after complicated or failed PTRA is feasible and effective and allows kidney salvage in most patients. Technical problems during surgical revascularization may require extracorporeal repair in some patients.

    "abstract": "Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) is a simple, inexpensive, and useful tool in the detection of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). The current guidelines published by the American Heart Association define ABI as the quotient of the higher of the systolic blood pressures (SBPs) of the two ankle arteries of that limb (either the anterior tibial artery or the posterior tibial artery) and the higher of the two brachial SBPs of the upper limbs. We hypothesized that considering the lower of the two ankle arterial SBPs of a side as the numerator and the higher of the brachial SBPs as the denominator would increase its diagnostic yield.\nThe former method of eliciting ABI was termed as high ankle pressure (HAP) and the latter low ankle pressure (LAP). ABI was assessed in 216 subjects and calculated according to the HAP and the LAP method. ABI findings were confirmed by arterial duplex ultrasonography. A significant arterial stenosis was assumed if ABI was <0.9.\nLAP had a sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.93. The HAP method had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.99. McNemar's test to compare the results of both methods demonstrated a two-tailed P < .0001, indicating a highly significant difference between both measurement methods.\nLAP is the superior method of calculating ABI to identify PAD. This result is of great interest for epidemiologic studies applying ABI measurements to detect PAD and assessing patients' cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator produced by endothelial cells, is reduced in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Because NO is rapidly inactivated by superoxide anion, we speculated that enhanced oxidative stress could lower NO generation. The aim of our study was to investigate if an imbalance between oxidative stress and NO does exist in patients with PAD and if an increase of NO formation could be achieved by an antioxidant treatment.\nIn a first study, serum levels of nitrite and nitrate (NOx), markers of NO generation, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress and maximal walking distance (MWD), were measured in 40 PAD patients and 40 controls. In a second study, 10 PAD patients were randomly allocated in a crossover design to intravenous propionyl-L-carnitine (6 g/day) or placebo for 7 days, with a washout of 30 days between the two phases of the trial. Serum levels of NOx and 8-OHdG were measured before and after the study.\nCompared with controls, serum levels of 8-OHdG (mean +/- SD) were significantly increased in PAD patients (4.4 +/- 3.1 ng/mL vs 2.4 +/- 1.2 ng/mL; P < .001), and serum levels of NOx were significantly decreased (11.6 +/- 6 microM vs 17 +/- 6.1 microM; P < .001). Levels of 8-OHdG and NOx were inversely correlated (r = -0.879; P < .001). Serum levels 8-OHdG were inversely correlated with MWD (r = -0.48, P = .002). The interventional trial showed no changes in the patients given placebo. Patients treated with propionyl-L-carnitine showed a significant increase of MWD from 101 +/- 31 meters to 129 +/- 35 meters (P = .007) and in NOx from 14.5 +/- 4.5 microM to 17.1 +/- 3.8 microM (P = .007). A significant decrease of 8-OHdG from 3.6 +/- 1.1 ng/mL to 2.6 +/- 1 ng/mL was also found (P = .005.)\nThis study suggests that in PAD patients, the reduction of NO generation could be dependent upon enhanced oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "We systematically reviewed clinical studies on the use of venous and arterial allografts for infrainguinal revascularization. We attempted to find evidence for the best infrainguinal vascular allograft by a systematic review of the available literature.\nAn electronic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was used to determine key articles from studies on the different types of vascular allografts used in infrainguinal reconstruction from 1966 to 2004. Articles were independently reviewed by using previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study results were gathered with cumulative primary patency as the primary end point. Secondary end points were major complications, graft disintegration, and major limb loss. Quantitative analysis was performed on the prospective randomized trials, and linear regression analysis was performed on cumulative primary patency. Fontaine's classification system was applied.\nNo systematic review of randomized controlled trials was found. Five randomized controlled trials, 3 prospective cohort or case series, and 15 retrospective case series with 3,837 vascular allografts were found. Methods of allograft preservation were cryopreservation (5 studies), cold storage (3 studies), and glutaraldehyde preservation of human umbilical veins (15 studies). One-year cumulative primary patency rates were 13% to 79% for cryopreservation, 63% to 80% for cold storage, and 40% to 91% for glutaraldehyde. The weighted mean 1-year cumulative primary graft patency rate was 41% for cryopreservation, 71% for cold storage, and 70% for glutaraldehyde allografts. Four randomized trials on femoropopliteal bypasses demonstrated higher patency rates of glutaraldehyde-preserved human umbilical veins than polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Statistical heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 91.4%) was too high to perform a formal meta-analysis. The rate of major limb loss was 20% to 58% for cryopreservation, 10% to 69% for cold storage, and 0% to 65% for glutaraldehyde, and the percentage of graft disintegration was 2% to 6% for cryopreservation, 4% to 15% for cold storage, and 0% to 11% for glutaraldehyde.\nA firm conclusion could not be made because there were no studies available in which direct comparison was performed between different preservation methods of vascular allografts. In addition, heterogeneity of the individual studies hampered direct comparison of different types of vascular allografts. However, the overall graft performance of glutaraldehyde-preserved human umbilical vein allografts may be superior to that of other vascular allografts.",

Five randomized controlled trials, 3 prospective cohort or case series, and 15 retrospective case series with 3,837 vascular allografts were found. Methods of allograft preservation were cryopreservation (5 studies), cold storage (3 studies), and glutaraldehyde preservation of human umbilical veins (15 studies). One-year cumulative primary patency rates were 13% to 79% for cryopreservation, 63% to 80% for cold storage, and 40% to 91% for glutaraldehyde. The weighted mean 1-year cumulative primary graft patency rate was 41% for cryopreservation, 71% for cold storage, and 70% for glutaraldehyde allografts. Four randomized trials on femoropopliteal bypasses demonstrated higher patency rates of glutaraldehyde-preserved human umbilical veins than polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Statistical heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 91.4%) was too high to perform a formal meta-analysis. The rate of major limb loss was 20% to 58% for cryopreservation, 10% to 69% for cold storage, and 0% to 65% for glutaraldehyde, and the percentage of graft disintegration was 2% to 6% for cryopreservation, 4% to 15% for cold storage, and 0% to 11% for glutaraldehyde.",

    "abstract": "In femoropopliteal bypass surgery, the use of saphenous vein grafts is preferable, but synthetic grafts are widely used above the knee. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the long-term patency of femoropopliteal bypass grafts classified as above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene, above-knee saphenous vein, or below-knee saphenous vein.\nStudies published from 1986 through 2004 were identified from electronic databases and reference lists; 73 articles contributed 1 or more series that used survival analysis, assessed femoropopliteal bypasses in one of the foregoing configurations, reported a 1-year graft patency rate, and included at least 30 bypasses. The series with a predominance of claudicant patients were included in meta-analysis C, and the series in which critical ischemia predominated were included in meta-analysis CI. Pooled survival curves of graft patency were constructed.\nIn meta-analysis C, the pooled primary graft patency was 57.4% for above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene, 77.2% for above-knee vein, and 64.8% for below-knee vein at 5 years; there was a significant difference between above-knee grafts at 3, 4, and 5 years (P < .05). The corresponding pooled secondary graft patency was 73.2%, 80.1%, and 79.7%, respectively (P > .05). In meta-analysis CI, the pooled primary graft patency was 48.3% for above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene, 69.4% for above-knee vein, and 68.9% for below-knee vein at 5 years; there was a significant difference between above-knee grafts until 4 years (P < .05). The corresponding pooled secondary graft patency was 54.0%, 71.9%, and 77.8%, respectively, with a significant difference between above-knee grafts at 2, 3, and 4 years (P < .05).\nThe great saphenous vein performs better than polytetrafluoroethylene in femoropopliteal bypass grafting and should be used whenever possible.",

    "abstract": "The optimal therapy for TransAtlantic Societal Consensus (TASC) type C femoropopliteal lesions remains a critical issue in the treatment of infrainguinal occlusive disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of limbs with TASC C femoropopliteal lesions and critical limb ischemia treated with the FoxHollow SilverHawk atherectomy catheter.\nFrom September 2004 to September 2005, 18 consecutive femoropopliteal procedures performed in 17 limbs in 16 patients were reviewed. Demographic data, baseline angiographic findings, and indications for the procedures were recorded. Clinical outcomes including symptom resolution and limb salvage were determined for the 17 primary procedures. Hemodynamic improvement was compared by using the paired Student t test. Stenosis-free patency was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nThe mean age was 72.5 years (range, 47-88 years). Fifty percent of the patients had four or more of the following risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and coronary artery disease. The indication was tissue loss in 13 limbs and rest pain in 4. All patients had a second level of disease, either inflow or tibial/pedal, which was treated concurrently when appropriate. Initial resolution of symptoms was achieved in 12 limbs, and partial healing was achieved in 2 others. Early amputation was necessary in the remaining three patients, but this was likely due to severe inframalleolar disease and advanced forefoot ischemia at the time of presentation. Five patients have remained symptom-free without restenosis at a mean follow-up of 6 months. Two patients have required late amputation for hemodynamic failure. The ankle-brachial index improved from 0.39 +/- 0.08 (mean +/- SEM) before surgery to 0.75 +/- 0.08 in the immediate postoperative period (P = .02). However, it returned toward baseline at 6 months after surgery, with a mean of 0.48 +/- 0.07. Stenosis-free patency of the femoropopliteal segment was 22% at 12 months.\nPeripheral atherectomy can achieve good early clinical and hemodynamic success in patients with TASC C lesions and critical limb ischemia. However, mid-term restenosis rates are high in this challenging cohort of patients.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of duplex ultrasound surveillance on the patency of femorofemoral bypasses performed for symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).\nA retrospective review was conducted of 108 patients (78 men, 30 women) with a mean age of 62 +/- 10 years who underwent femorofemoral prosthetic (n = 100) or vein (n = 8) bypass grafting for symptomatic PAOD (claudication, 38%; rest pain, 41%; tissue loss, 11%; infection, 10%) during a 10-year period. Prior or concomitant inflow iliac artery stenting was performed in 26 patients (24%), and a redo femorofemoral bypass was performed in 19 patients (18%). Duplex ultrasound surveillance of the reconstruction was performed at 6-month intervals to assess patency, graft (midgraft peak systolic flow velocity) hemodynamics, and identify inflow or outflow stenotic lesions. Repair was recommended for a stenosis with a peak systolic velocity (PSV) >300 cm/s and a PSV ratio >3.5. Life-table analysis was used to estimate primary, assisted-primary, and secondary graft patency.\nDuring a mean 40-month follow-up (range, 2 to 120 months), 31 bypasses (29%) were revised: 19 duplex-detected stenosis involving the inflow iliac artery (n = 15) or anastomotic stenosis (n = 4), or both, 11 for graft thrombosis, and 1 for graft infection. Abnormal inflow iliac (PSV >300 cm/s) hemodynamics or a mid-graft PSV <60 cm/s was measured in eight of 11 grafts before thrombosis. Mean time to revision was 30 +/- 17 months. The primary graft patency at 1, 3, and 5 years was 86%, 78%, and 62%, respectively. Correction of duplex-detected stenosis resulted in assisted-primary patency of 95% at 1 year and 88% at 3 and 5 years (P < .0001, log-rank). Secondary graft patency was 98% at 1 year and 93% at 3 and 5 years.\nVascular laboratory surveillance after femorofemoral bypass that included duplex ultrasound imaging of the inflow iliac artery and graft accurately identified failing grafts. A duplex-detected identified stenosis with a PSV >300 cm/s correlated with failure, and repair of identified lesions was associated with excellent 5-year patency.",

The following patients were included in the analysis: (1) International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure code 38.12 (endarterectomy of the vessels of the head and neck other than intracranial vessels) in the primary coding position but not in any secondary position, or (2) the diagnosis code 433.00 to 433.91 (occlusion/stenosis, precerebral artery), or (3) the diagnosis-related group (DRG) 5 (extracranial vascular procedure). Symptomatic patients were identified by history of previous stroke (ICD-9 codes 342 or 438), transient ischemic attack (435 or 781.4), or amaurosis fugax (362.34 or 368.12). In-hospital strokes were identified by ICD-9 codes 997.0, 997.00, 997.01, and 997.09. Low-, moderate-, and high-volume surgeons were defined as performing <15, 15 to 74 and >or=75 CEAs annually. Hospital volumes were similarly classified as low for those performing <or=20 CEAs, moderate for 21 to 100, and high for >100 annually.\nIn the Maryland data, 23,237 CEA cases were identified with 169 in-hospital strokes over 10 years (0.73%), whereas the 51,331 California CEAs had 232 in-hospital strokes over 5 years (0.45%). The stroke rate in Maryland was 2.12% in 1994, 1.47% in 1995, and 0.29% to 0.65% from 1996 to 2003.

A similar decrease was identified in the asymptomatic patient population but was less pronounced: 1.64% in 1994, 0.81% in 1995, and 0.15% to 0.44% from 1996 to 2003. The low recent stroke rates were confirmed by the California data (0.44% to 0.48% from 1999 to 2003). Changes in the death rate for CEA during this time frame have not been as pronounced, from 0.33% to 0.58% for Maryland and 0.78% to 0.91% for California.\nA dramatic decrease in the in-hospital stroke rates in Maryland occurred around 1995. The stroke rates in Maryland in the past 5 years are similar to those in California during the same period. An analysis of data from the two states shows that the in-hospital stroke rate now for carotid endarterectomy is approximately 0.54%.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been introduced as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. Both techniques seem to be associated with postoperative hemodynamic lability. Both may induce baroreceptor dysfunction, possibly leading to transient impairment of cardiovascular autonomic activity and resulting in hemodynamic instability. This instability might contribute to postoperative morbidity. To elucidate these phenomena, we studied the cardiac baroreflex and autonomic cardiovascular control after CAS and CEA.\nIn 20 patients scheduled for CAS (n = 10) or CEA (n = 10), intra-arterial pressures and electrocardiograms were recorded during 10 minutes before and 8 and 24 hours after the procedure. Spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was assessed using the sequence method and cross-spectral analysis. In addition, cardiovascular autonomic activity was investigated using spectral analysis of heart rate variability and systolic arterial pressure variability.\nAfter CAS, we demonstrated an increase of the spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity median (interquartile range) from 5.6 (5.1 to 6.2) ms/mm Hg before the procedure to 8.8 (6.8 to 10.5) ms/mm Hg and 7.7 (3.9 to 8.6) ms/mm Hg (P < .001), 8 and 24 hours after the procedure. This was consistent with the increase of the high frequency component of heart rate variability reflecting cardiac parasympathetic activity and a decrease of the low frequency of systolic arterial pressure variability reflecting sympathetic vascular activity. The postoperative period was also associated with decreased systolic arterial pressure from 173 (162 to 190) mm Hg at baseline to 122 (109 to 143) mm Hg and 136 (121 to 143) mm Hg at 8 and 24 hours after CAS (P < .001). No changes in baroreflex sensitivity or in autonomic activity were observed after CEA.\nThese preliminary data suggest that CAS is associated with parasympathetic predominance postoperatively and may probably explain the lower systolic arterial pressure observed after CAS.",

    "abstract": "The use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been restricted to a small number of specialized units on a selected group of patients. The aim of this study is to assess if the overall mortality in these patients with ruptured AAA may be reduced in a unit where all patients with ruptured AAA are considered first for EVAR.\nDuring a 24-month period beginning in July 2002, 51 patients admitted with ruptured AAA were considered for EVAR as the treatment of choice and comprised the study group. EVAR was performed in 17 patients. Open repair was performed in 34 patients: 13 patients had hemodynamic instability and 16 patients had an unsuitable aortic neck anatomy. The study group was compared with a historical control group of 41 patients with ruptured AAA who were treated by open repair from July 2000 to June 2002.\nMortality rate was 39% in the study group compared with 59% in the control group (P = .065). The duration of stay in the intensive care unit was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (P = .01), although the total in-hospital stay was similar (17 days vs 14 days, P = .83). Within the study group, EVAR patients had a mortality rate of 24% compared with 47% in the open group (P = .14).\nAlthough the number of patients was small, offering EVAR to as many patients as possible with ruptured AAA has resulted in a 20% reduction in mortality, albeit statistically insignificant. However, it is in the unstable patients that EVAR will need to improve survival before it may be hailed to supersede the conventional approach.",

    "abstract": "Traditional repair of aortic arch aneurysms requires cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermia, and circulatory arrest and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Endovascular stent-graft placement has developed as a safe and effective treatment for various diseases of the descending aorta and, recently, even in delicate anatomic regions such as the aortic arch. The aim of this study is to review our clinical experience with endovascular treatment of aortic arch aneurysms after surgical transposition of supra-aortic vessels.\nFifteen patients received thoracic stent-graft implants after aortic debranching for repair of aortic arch aneurysms during the 3-year period ending December 31, 2005. All patients were not candidates for standard endovascular repair due to inadequate proximal landing zones on the aortic arch. Device design and implant strategy were determined by an evaluation of aortic morphology with angiography and computed tomography (CT) scanning. Stent-grafts were used to repair the arch after supra-aortic vessel transposition was performed. The endografts were implanted transfemorally or via an iliac Dacron conduit graft using standardized endovascular techniques. Follow-up was 100% complete (mean, 18 +/- 2.5 months; range, 12 to 36 months). Outcome variables included death and treatment failure (endoleak, aortic rupture, reintervention, or aortic-related or sudden death). Follow-up included clinical examination, chest radiograph, and CT at discharge, 6 months after stent-graft placement, and yearly thereafter.\nStent-graft deployment success was 100% after staged supra-aortic vessel transposition. Patency of all endografts and conventional bypasses was 100%. No endoleak or graft migration was observed. There were no neurologic complications. One patient died 2 months after the procedure from pulmonary complications.\nRepair of aortic arch aneurysms by sequential transposition of the supra-aortic branches and endovascular stent-graft placement is feasible. Extended application of this technique will enable safe and effective treatment of a highly selected subgroup of patients with aortic aneurysms by avoiding conventional arch aneurysm repair in deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of type II endoleaks remains controversial because little is known about their long-term natural history and impact on changes in aneurysm morphology. This study reviews type II endoleaks occurring in patients after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) at a single-institution over an 8-year period.\nAll patients undergoing EVAR who had type II endoleaks documented on follow-up imaging studies at our institution between January 1997 and March 2005 were reviewed. Data regarding patient demographics in addition to aneurysm size, device type, operative complications, and secondary interventions were reviewed. Outcomes evaluated included the rate of spontaneous sealing, freedom from secondary intervention, and aneurysm enlargement, rupture, or conversion.\nType II endoleaks were present in 154 of 965 patients (16.0%) undergoing EVAR. Mean follow-up time was 22.0 months (range, 1 to 72 months). Fifty-five patients (35.7%) with type II endoleaks sealed spontaneously in a mean time of 14.5 months. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, approximately 75% of type II endoleaks sealed spontaneously within a 5-year period. Nineteen patients (12.3%) with type II endoleaks were treated at a mean time of 19.9 months at the operating surgeon's discretion, including 13 with sac enlargement >5 mm. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that approximately 65% of the patients remained free of intervention after a period of 4 years. Thirteen patients (8.4%) experienced aneurysm sac enlargement >5 mm. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that approximately 80% of patients with type II endoleaks remained free of sac enlargement >5 mm over a 4-year period. No patients with type II endoleaks experienced rupture or required conversion to open repair during their follow-up. Cox regression analysis showed that cancer, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with earlier spontaneous closure of the type II endoleaks (P < .05).\nWe observed that type II endoleaks have a relatively benign course, and in the absence of sac expansion, can be followed for a prolonged course of time without the need for intervention. The rate of spontaneous seal continues to increase with time and, therefore, close follow-up of patients with type II endoleaks who show no signs of aneurysm expansion is a safe approach. For patients in whom the exact etiology of their endoleak is in question, dynamic imaging should be used to exclude the presence of a type I endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Endoleaks are one of the unique complications seen after endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TEVAR). This investigation was performed to evaluate the incidence and determinants of endoleaks, as well as the outcomes of secondary interventions in patients with endoleaks, after TEVAR.\nOver a 6-year period, 105 patients underwent TEVAR in the context of pivotal Food and Drug Administration trials with the Medtronic Talent (n = 64) and Gore TAG (n = 41) devices. The medical and radiology records of these patients were reviewed for this retrospective study. Of these, 69 patients (30 women and 39 men) had follow-up longer than 1 month and were used for this analysis. The patients were evaluated for the presence of an endoleak, endoleak type, aneurysm expansion, and endoleak intervention.\nThe mean follow-up in this patient cohort was 17.3 +/- 14.7 months (range, 3-71 months). Endoleaks were detected in 29% (20/69) of patients, of which 40% (8/20) were type I, 35% (7/20) were type II, 20% (4/20) were type III, and 5% (1/20) had more than one type of endoleak. Patients without endoleaks experienced greater aneurysm sac regression than those with endoleaks (-2.89 +/- 9.1 mm vs -0.13 +/- 7.2 mm), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = .232). All but 2 endoleaks (90%; 18/20) were detected on the initial postoperative computed tomographic scan at 30 days. Two endoleaks (10%; 2/20) developed late. The endoleak group had more extensive aneurysms with significantly larger aneurysms at the time of intervention (69.4 +/- 10.5 mm vs 60.6 +/- 11.0 mm; P = .003). Factors predictive of endoleak included male sex (P = .016), larger aneurysm size (P = .003), the length of aorta treated by stent grafts (P = .0004), and an increasing number of stents used (P < .0001). No open conversions were performed for treatment of endoleaks. Four (50%) of the eight type I endoleaks were successfully repaired by using endovascular techniques. None of the type II endoleaks was treated by secondary intervention. During follow-up, the maximum aneurysm diameter in the type II endoleak patients increased a mean of 2.94 +/- 7.2 mm (range, -4.4 to 17 mm). Spontaneous thrombosis has occurred in 29% (2/7) of the type II endoleaks. Patients with type III endoleaks experienced a decrease in mean maximal aneurysm diameter of 0.78 +/- 3.1 mm during follow-up.\nEndoleaks are not uncommon after TEVAR. Many type I endoleaks may be treated successfully by endovascular means. Short-term follow-up suggests that observational management of type II endoleaks is associated with continued sac expansion, and these patients should be monitored closely.",

    "abstract": "There is a paucity of data regarding gastrointestinal (GI) complications after descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic (DTA/TAA) surgical repairs. We examined our 14-year experience with these repairs to determine the incidence, outcomes, and risk factors for postoperative GI complications.\nBetween February 1991 and February 2005, we repaired 1,159 DTA/TAA. Data were prospectively collected. The mean patient age was 68 years and 36% were women. Complications were classified as biliary disease, hepatic dysfunction, pancreatitis, GI bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, bowel ischemia, and ileus. Risk factors for the occurrence of GI complications were ascertained by univariate and multivariable analysis.\nOf the 1,159 patients, 81 had 109 GI complications, for a 7% incidence. The mortality associated with GI complications was 39.5% compared with 13.5% (P < .0001) in patients without GI complications. The incidences of complications were bowel ischemia, 2.5% with 62% mortality; biliary disease, 0.3% with 75% mortality; hepatic dysfunction, 1.6% with 38% mortality; acute pancreatitis, 0.3% with 20% mortality; GI bleeding, 1.5% with 29% mortality; peptic ulcer disease, 0.9% with 30% mortality; and ileus, 2.2% with 26% mortality. Postoperative biliary disease (odds ratio [OR], 16.58; P = .001), hepatic dysfunction (OR, 3.58; P = .006), and bowel ischemia (OR, 10.03; P = .0001) were significantly associated with an increased postoperative mortality. Risk factors for the occurrence of GI complications were visceral involvement of the aortic repair (TAA extent II, III, and IV) (OR, 2.08; P = .002) and low preoperative glomerular filtration rate (OR, .98; P = .0002).\nBiliary disease, hepatic dysfunction, and bowel ischemia after DTA/TAA surgical repairs were associated with an increased mortality. Visceral involvement and preoperative renal insufficiency were risk factors for the occurrence of GI complications.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) size and growth has been found to be associated with local generation of inflammation markers such as interleukin-6. Inflammation also seems to be important in perioperative adverse cardiac events. We hypothesized that patients with a large AAA are at increased risk for cardiac events.\nConsecutive patients who underwent a computed tomography angiography scan before open elective infrarenal AAA repair between March 2000 and December 2005 at three hospitals were analyzed. All patients were screened for the clinical risk factors of age, gender, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabetes, stroke, renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as for cardioprotective medication. Postoperative data on troponin release, creatine kinase/creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, and electrocardiogram were routinely collected on days 1, 3, 7, and 30. The main outcome measure was the combined end point of 30-day cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the influence of AAA size on postoperative cardiac outcome.\nThe study included 500 patients. Their mean age was 69.8 +/- 9.5 years, and 431 (86%) were men. Thirty-one patients (6.2%) had perioperative cardiovascular complications, consisting of 15 (3.0%) cardiovascular deaths and 16 (3.2%) nonfatal myocardial infarctions. After correction for other risk factors, including age, Revised Cardiac Risk Index, medication use, duration of surgery, and intraoperative blood loss, AAA size was independently associated with perioperative nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death (3.2% increase in risk for each millimeter added, 95% confidence interval 1.1% to 6.2%, P = .007).\nA larger AAA size is independently associated with an increased incidence of perioperative cardiovascular complications after elective infrarenal AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "The optimal timing of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) after ipsilateral hemispheric stroke is controversial. Although early studies suggested that an interval of about 6 weeks after a completed stroke was preferred, more recent data have suggested that delaying CEA for this period of time is not necessary. With these issues in mind, we reviewed our experience to examine perioperative outcome with respect to the timing of CEA in previously symptomatic patients.\nA retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all CEAs performed at our institution from 1992 to 2003 showed that 2537 CEA were performed, of which 1,158 (45.6%) were in symptomatic patients. Patients who were operated on emergently <or=48 hours of symptoms for crescendo transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or stroke-in-evolution were excluded from analysis (n = 25). CEA was considered \"early\" if performed <or=4 weeks of symptoms, and \"delayed\" if performed after a minimum of a 4-week interval following the most recent symptom.\nOf nonurgent CEAs in symptomatic patients, in 87 instances the exact time interval from symptoms to surgery could not be precisely determined secondary to the remoteness of the symptoms (>18 months), and these were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 1,046 cases, 62.7% had TIAs and 37.3% had completed strokes as their indication for surgery. Among the entire cohort, patients who underwent early CEA were significantly more likely to experience a perioperative stroke than patients who underwent delayed CEA (5.1% vs 1.6%, P = .002). Patients with TIAs alone were more likely to be operated on early rather than in a delayed fashion (64.3% vs 46.7%, P < .0001), likely reflecting institutional bias in selecting delayed CEA for stroke patients. However, even when examined as two separate groups, both TIA patients (n = 656) and CVA patients (n = 390) were significantly more likely to experience a perioperative stroke when operated upon early rather than in a delayed fashion (TIA patients, 3.3% vs 0.9%, P = .05; CVA patients, 9.4% vs 2.4%, P = .003). There were no significant differences in demographics or other meaningful variables between patients who underwent early CEA and those who underwent delayed CEA.\nIn a large institutional experience, patients who underwent CEA <or=4 weeks of ipsilateral TIA or stroke experienced a significantly increased rate of perioperative stroke compared with patients who underwent CEA in a more delayed fashion. This was true for both TIA and stroke patients, although the results were more impressive among stroke patients. On the basis of these results, we continue to recommend that waiting period of 4 weeks be considered in stroke patients who are candidates for CEA.",

    "abstract": "The study assessed mid-term outcome of emergency endovascular repair for acute infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms, with special attention to secondary interventions.\nBetween May 1998 and August 2005, 56 patients underwent emergent endovascular repair for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 34) or an acute nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 22). During the same period, 322 consecutive patients underwent elective endovascular aneurysm repair and were used as control group. Five types of stent grafts were used: Vanguard, Talent, Excluder, Zenith, and Quantum. Follow-up included abdominal radiograph, duplex ultrasound scanning, and computed tomographic angiography. Outcome measures included all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality, complications, and secondary interventions.\nMortality at 30 days was 18%, 5%, and 1% in the ruptured, acute nonruptured, and elective aneurysm groups, respectively. Overall mean follow-up was 38 +/- 26 months. In the ruptured aneurysm group, survival was 67.8% +/- 8.6% at 1 year and 62.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 and 3 years. Seven secondary interventions (4 early and 3 late) were required in five patients (15%), with a cumulative risk of 9.2% +/- 5.1% at 1 year and 16.2% +/- 8.2% at 2 and 3 years. In the acute nonruptured aneurysm group, survival was 90.9% +/- 6.1% at 1 year, 84.8% +/- 8.2% at 2 years, and 76.4% +/- 10.9% at 3 years. Four secondary interventions (1 early and 3 late) were required in four patients (18%), with a cumulative risk of 9.6% +/- 6.5% at 1 and 2 years and 20.9% +/- 12.0% at 3 years.

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to characterize the contemporary surgical treatment of pediatric renovascular hypertension.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted of the clinical data of 97 consecutive pediatric patients (39 girls, 58 boys), aged from 3 months to 17 years, who underwent operation at the University of Michigan from 1963 to 2006. All but one patient had refractory hypertension not responsive to contemporary medical therapy. Developmental renal artery stenoses accounted for 80% of the renal artery disease, with inflammatory and other ill-defined stenoses encountered less frequently. Splanchnic arterial occlusive lesions affected 24% and abdominal aortic coarctations, 33%.\nPrimary renal artery operations were undertaken 132 times. Procedures included resection beyond the stenosis and implantation into the aorta in 49, renal artery in 7, or superior mesenteric artery in 3; aortorenal and iliorenal bypasses with vein or iliac artery grafts in 40; focal arterioplasty in 10; resection with reanastomosis in 4; operative dilation in 4; splenorenal bypass in 2; and primary nephrectomy in 13 when arterial reconstructions proved impossible. Bilateral renal operations were done in 34 children, and 17 underwent celiac or superior mesenteric arterial reconstructions, including 15 at the time of the renal operation. Thirty patients underwent abdominal aortic reconstructions with patch aortoplasty (n = 19) or thoracoabdominal bypass (n = 11). Twenty-five of the aortic procedures were performed coincidently with the renal operations. Thirty secondary renal artery procedures were done in 19 patients, including nine nephrectomies. Hypertension was cured in 68 children (70%), improved in 26 (27%), and was unchanged in three (3%). Follow-up averaged 4.2 years. No patients required dialysis, and there were no operative deaths.\nContemporary surgical treatment of pediatric renovascular hypertension emphasizes direct aortic implantation of the normal renal artery beyond its stenosis and single-staged concomitant splanchnic and aortic reconstructions when necessary. Benefits accompany carefully executed operative procedures in 97% of these children.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral embolism is the first cause of neurologic complications of carotid artery stenting (CAS). A large debate has been raised to identify the caseload necessary for an appropriate learning curve before systematic use of CAS. This study examined (1) the timing of periprocedural complications during CAS and how these complications vary over time to identify factors that contribute to neurologic morbidity and (2) a sufficient number of procedures for adequate training.\nDuring 2001 to 2006, 627 CAS procedures with cerebral protection devices (CPD) were performed in a single vascular surgery center by a team including a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist. These represented 38% of a total of 1598 carotid revascularizations performed in the same interval. CAS procedures were divided into two groups according to time interval: the first period, 2001 to 2003, included 195 CAS procedures, and the second period, 2004 to 2006, included 432 CAS procedures. During each CAS procedure, five major steps were considered: phase 1, or the catheterization phase, included the passage of the aortic arch, catheterization of the target vessel, and introduction of a guiding catheter or sheath. Phase 2, or the crossing stenosis phase, included the placement of a CPD. Phase 3, or the stent ballooning phase, included predilation (when indicated), stent implantation, postdilation, and recovery of the protection system. Phase 4, or the early postinterventional phase, included the first 24 hours after leaving the catheterization table. Phase 5, or the late postinterventional phase, included the interval from the first postoperative day to 30 days.\nAt 30 days, 10 major strokes (2 of which were fatal) and 1 cardiac death occurred, for an overall major stroke/death rate of 1.75%. Furthermore, 18 minor strokes (2.9%) were recorded. By analyzing the occurrence of major strokes according to the three intraprocedural phases, four occurred in phase 1 and six in phase 3. All strokes but one were ischemic; six were ipsilateral, three were contralateral, and one was posterior. Minor strokes occurred prevalently after the procedure (11 in phase 4, 5 in phase 5, and 1 for phases 1 and 3). Comparing the first with the second interval of the study period, the 30-day major stroke and death rate decreased from 3.1% to 0.9% (P = .047), and the 30-day any stroke and death rate decreased from 8.2% to 2.7% (P = .005). According to multivariate analysis, study interval (hazard ratio, 3.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-9.01; P = .005) and age (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.12; P = .05) were significant predictors of stroke.\nA large proportion of major strokes (4/10) from CAS cannot be prevented by using CPD, because these strokes occur during catheterization (phase 1). This finding, together with the significant decrease in the overall stroke/death rate between the first and the last interval of the study period, enhances the importance of an appropriate learning curve that involves a caseload larger than that generally accepted for credentialing. The noticeable number of postprocedural cerebral embolizations leading to minor strokes and occurring in the early and late postinterventional phases (16/18) is likely due to factors less strictly related to the learning-curve effect, such as stent design and medical therapy. Moreover, expertise in selecting material and design of the stents according to different vessel morphology, in association with correct medical treatment, may be useful in reducing the number of minor strokes that occur in the later postinterventional phases of CAS.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing open gastric bypass (OGB) for morbid obesity are at significant risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) despite the use of subcutaneous heparin injections and sequential compression devices. Prophylactic preoperative inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement may reduce this risk. We report our experience with simultaneous IVC filter placement and OGB in an operating room setting.\nFrom July 1999 to April 2001, 193 patients (group 1) underwent OGB. Eight patients had prophylactic intraoperative IVC filters placed for deep vein thrombosis, PE, or pulmonary hypertension. From May 2001 to January 2003, 181 patients (group 2) underwent OGB. There were 33 IVC filters placed for body mass index (BMI) greater than 55 kg/m2 in addition to the above-mentioned criteria. To confirm observations made in group 1 and 2 patients, from July 2003 to May 2005, 197 patients (group 3) underwent OGB, and patients with a BMI greater than 55 kg/m2 (n = 35) were offered IVC filter placement. Group 3A (n = 17) consented to IVC filter placement, and group 3B (n = 18) did not.\nFifty-eight IVC filters were placed (100% technical success rate) with an increase in operating room time of 20 +/- 5 minutes. In group 1, the eight patients with IVC filters had a BMI greater than 55 kg/m2. There were four PEs (3 fatal and 1 nonfatal) in the other 185 patients, all which occurred in patients with BMIs greater than 55 kg/m2. In group 2, there were no PEs. The perioperative PE rate in these patients was reduced from 13% (4/31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1%-25.7%) to 0% (0/33; 95% CI, 0%-8.7%). Perioperative mortality was reduced from 10% (3/31; 95% CI, 0%-20.0%) to 0% (0/33; 95% CI, 0%-8.7%). There were no pulmonary emboli or deaths related to PE in group 3A patients. Group 3B patients had a 28% PE rate (two fatal and three nonfatal) and an 11% PE-related death rate. None of the remaining patients in group 3 had a PE.\nIntraoperative IVC filter placement for the prevention of PE in morbidly obese patients undergoing OGB is feasible. We observed a significant reduction in the perioperative PE rate when a BMI greater than 55 kg/m2 was used as an indication for IVC filter placement despite the use of subcutaneous heparin injections and sequential compression devices.",

    "abstract": "The standard technique of balloon angioplasty with or without subintimal dissection of infrainguinal arteries requires contrast arteriography and fluoroscopy. We attempted to perform this procedure with duplex guidance to avoid the use of nephrotoxic contrast material and eliminate or minimize radiation exposure.\nFrom September 2003 to June 2005, 196 patients (57% male) with a mean age of 73 +/- 10 years (range, 42-97 years) had a total of 253 attempted balloon angioplasties of the superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery under duplex guidance in 218 limbs. Critical ischemia was the indication in 38% of cases, and disabling claudication was the indication in 62%. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, smoking, and coronary artery disease were present in 78%, 51%, 41%, 39%, and 37% of patients, respectively. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification was used for morphologic description of femoral-popliteal lesions. The common femoral artery was cannulated under direct duplex visualization. Still under duplex guidance, a guidewire was directed into the proximal superficial femoral artery, across the diseased segment(s), and parked at the tibioperoneal trunk. The diseased segment(s) were then balloon-dilated. Balloon diameter and length were chosen according to arterial measurements obtained by duplex scan. Hemodynamically significant defects causing diameter reductions greater than 30% and peak systolic velocity ratios greater than 2 were stented with a variety of self-expandable stents under duplex guidance. Completion duplex examinations and ankle-brachial indices were obtained routinely before hospital discharge.\nThere were 11 (4%) TASC class A lesions, 31 (12%) TASC class B lesions, 177 (70%) TASC class C lesions, and 34 (14%) TASC class D lesions in this series. The overall technical success was 93% (236/253 cases). Eight of the 17 failed subintimal dissections belonged to TASC class C and the remaining 9 to TASC class D. End-stage renal disease was the only significant predictor of subintimal dissection failure in patients with femoral-popliteal occlusions (5/17 cases; P < .04). Intraluminal stents were placed in 153 (65%) of 236 successful cases. Overall pre-procedure and post-procedure ankle-brachial indices changed from a mean of 0.69 +/- 0.16 (range, 0.2-1.1) to 0.95 +/- 0.14 (range, 0.55-1.3), respectively (P < .0001). The mean duration of follow-up was 10 +/- 7 months (range, 1-29 months). The overall 30-day survival rate was 100%. Overall limb salvage rates were 94% and 90% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Six-month patency rates for TASC class A, B, C, and D lesions were 89%, 73%, 72%, and 63%, respectively. Twelve-month patency rates for TASC class A, B, C, and D lesions were 89%, 58%, 51%, and 45%, respectively.\nDuplex-guided balloon angioplasty and stent placement seems to be a safe and effective technique for the treatment of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease. Technical advantages include direct visualization of the puncture site, accurate selection of the proper size balloon and stent, and confirmation of the adequacy of the technique by hemodynamic and imaging parameters. Additional benefits are avoidance of radiation exposure and contrast material.",

    "abstract": "An easy-to-use vascular sealant with good safety and efficacy is needed to prevent anastomotic bleeding in vascular surgery. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cyanoacrylate surgical sealant in establishing hemostasis of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene to arterial vascular anastomoses in arteriovenous (AV) grafts and femoral bypass grafts.\nThis multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study was conducted in a hospital setting at 12 sites: 10 in the United States and 2 in Europe. A total of 151 patients undergoing femoral bypass procedures or AV shunt procedures for hemodialysis access using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were randomized 2:1 to receive cyanoacrylate surgical sealant or the control (oxidized cellulose) between April 26, 2004, and January 18, 2005. Randomization was stratified by clinical site and type of procedure. After the anastomosis, cyanoacrylate surgical sealant or the control was applied to all anastomosis sites for patients undergoing femoral bypass procedures and to only the arterial anastomosis sites for patients undergoing AV shunt procedures. The primary end point was the elapsed time from clamp release to hemostasis. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients achieving hemostasis at t = 0 (immediate), 1, 5, or 10 minutes after clamp release, use of additional adjunctive measures to achieve hemostasis, and occurrence of adverse events.\nBaseline demographics and clinical characteristics showed that the two treatment groups were similar at baseline. The mean time from clamp release to hemostasis was 119.3 seconds with cyanoacrylate surgical sealant vs 403.8 seconds with the control (P < .001). Immediate hemostasis was achieved in 54.5% of patients receiving cyanoacrylate surgical sealant and in 10% of those receiving the control. The proportion of patients requiring additional adjunctive measures was lower with cyanoacrylate surgical sealant, and the occurrence of adverse events was similar in both groups.\nThis study demonstrates that cyanoacrylate surgical sealant is effective at reducing the time to hemostasis and achieving immediate hemostasis in AV shunt and femoral bypass procedures and that it is safe for internal use. Cyanoacrylate surgical sealant is an easy-to-use vascular sealant with good safety and efficacy that significantly decreases anastomotic bleeding in vascular surgery.",

Although contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a powerful means for looking at the vascular lumen, it provides little information on the vessel wall, particularly when mask subtraction methods are used. We report three cases in which the maximal intensity projections obtained from gadolinium-enhanced MRA source images showed only internal carotid artery stenoses, whereas source images revealed a focal increased T1 signal in the wall of the internal carotid artery, representing either intraplaque hemorrhage or thrombosed ulceration. Hence, the physicians interpreting an MRA in an acute stroke patient should not limit themselves to the synthetic maximal intensity projections but should also always review the source partitions, which can contain information related to an acute intraplaque accident.",

    "abstract": "Left-sided superior vena cava (SVC) as the result of persistence of the left superior cardinal vein in postnatal life is a rare congenital anomaly, is usually associated with other cardiac defects, and can cause symptoms of right to left shunt. We report the case of a 58-year-old Asian man with a history of end-stage renal disease and Ebstein anomaly that was corrected surgically who presented with progressively worsening disabling dyspnea. An echocardiogram with concomitant intravenous saline injection raised the suspicion of right to left shunt, a finding that was confirmed with contrast injection of the left SVC that rapidly filled the left heart chambers and subsequently the aortic arch. To treat this anomaly, we accessed the left basilic vein under ultrasound guidance and inserted a 14F sheath into the left subclavian vein. A covered stent was then prepared at the back table with three Prolene 4-0 sutures that were wrapped around the middle portion of the graft to achieve a controlled area of stenosis after deployment. The stent graft was placed along the proximal innominate vein and the contiguous part of the left SVC. Coil embolization was then performed with coils that were positioned at the stenotic area of the covered stent. An immediate venogram demonstrated residual flow into the left SVC; however, a delayed venogram 2 weeks after the procedure showed occlusion of the left SVC and the development of collaterals to the right innominate vein that was draining to a normal right SVC. The patient remained marginally hypotensive after surgery, but he soon noted a substantial improvement in his symptoms. A repeat echocardiogram with intravenous saline injection confirmed the correction of the right to left shunt. Endovascular repair of persistent left SVC is feasible and safe and can be performed with minimal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to characterize the coordinated molecular changes evoked in the structure and composition of the wall of a venous segment when exposed to fistula flow.\nAn arteriovenous shunt was created in adult C57BL/6J mice. Remodeled veins and contralateral control jugular veins were isolated 7 days after surgery. Total RNA was isolated, linearly amplified, and the transcriptional profiles of this early adaptive response were obtained by microarray analysis. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on remodeled veins and control veins isolated on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after surgery to further examine distinct spatial and temporal aspects of this early process.\nThere were 131 significantly upregulated and 165 downregulated genes in the remodeled vein compared with the control jugular vein. Genes involved in extracellular matrix reorganization were highly upregulated. Movat's pentachrome staining revealed ground substance on day 3 that was not observed on day 5. The appearance of elastin fibers was first observed on day 7. Morphometric analysis demonstrated maximum wall thickness on day 3. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of tenascin-C, thrombospondin, lysyl oxidase, and osteopontin in different cell types at different time points throughout the first week after surgery.\nMajor changes in the organization of the extracellular matrix occur during the early response of venous remodeling. Elastin, tenascin-C, thrombospondin, lysyl oxidase, and osteopontin are expressed within the wall of the remodeling vein resulting in the de novo formation of an extracellular matrix scaffold that may be part of a critical adaptation program being evoked to allow the vessel to cope with its new biomechanical environment.\nThe Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative has proposed the construction of arteriovenous fistulas as the primary vascular access for hemodialysis. As the vein is exposed to arterial flow, the vein wall dilates and a vascular remodeling process is triggered. With continued exposure, intimal hyperplasia occurs at the anastomosis that in many cases leads to failure. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the outflow vein remodels into a mature fistula remain incompletely understood. By investigating venous remodeling in a fistula model, candidate genes important for the remodeling process are discovered and their functional significance examined. Thus, the identification of relevant genes involved in this process should provide insight into arteriovenous fistula maturation and may suggest novel approaches for achieving higher patency rates.",

    "abstract": "Homocysteine is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether ginkgolide A (GA), a major constituent of Ginkgo biloba, could block homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction in porcine coronary arteries.\nPorcine coronary artery rings were assigned to six treatment groups: control; homocysteine (50 micromol/L); low-dose (50 micromol/L) or high-dose (100 micromol/L) GA; and homocysteine plus low-dose or high-dose GA. After 24 hours' incubation, the rings were analyzed for vasomotor function in response to a thromboxane A2 analogue (U46619), bradykinin, and sodium nitroprusside. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was studied by using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis. Superoxide anion production was assessed by chemoluminescence analysis.\nEndothelium-dependent relaxation (bradykinin) was significantly reduced in ring segments treated with homocysteine as compared with the control (P < .05). When homocysteine was combined with either low-dose or high-dose GA, endothelium-dependent relaxation was markedly recovered. There was no significant difference in maximal contraction (U46619) or endothelium-independent relaxation (sodium nitroprusside) among all groups. In addition, superoxide anion production was increased by 113% in the homocysteine-treated group, whereas there was no statistically significant difference between the control and GA/homocysteine groups. Furthermore, eNOS messenger RNA and protein levels were substantially reduced in the homocysteine-treated group (P < .05), but not in the GA/homocysteine combined groups.\nHomocysteine significantly impairs endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation through oxidative stress and downregulation of eNOS in porcine coronary arteries. GA effectively prevents homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction and molecular changes in porcine coronary arteries. This study underscores the potential clinical benefits and applications of GA in controlling homocysteine-associated vascular injury and cardiovascular disease.\nHomocysteine is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis.

    "abstract": "Because of the low patency rate of currently available vascular bypass grafts, researchers are working towards the development of alternative bypass grafts, ranging from synthetic prostheses to wholly biologic living grafts. The philosophy of measurement required by regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as to gain the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene (CE) mark is to test above and beyond the limits that would be expected physiologically. The critical parameter of burst pressure is needed for Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene (CE) mark or United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before clinical trials can proceed. An accurate measurement of burst pressure in potential porous vascular bypass grafts is, therefore, of utmost importance to ensure adequate strength on implantation in animals and subsequent clinical use. A wide range of methods to measure burst pressure have been used. We tested the burst pressure of a new polyurethane-based nanocomposite vascular prosthesis by using different methods to assess whether the method used affected the results.\nWater was infused at flow rates of 0.2, 50, and 100 mL/min through a syringe pump into latex sleeve-lined porous prostheses manufactured from a poly(carbonate-urea)urethane nanocomposite incorporating silsesquioxane. At the lowest infusion rate, the inflation was done with and without a nonporous inner lining sleeve. A pressure transducer was used to record the peak pressure achieved.\nUsing a nonporous sleeve resulted in a higher burst pressure (428 mm Hg vs 341 mm Hg) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. A lower infusion rate (0.2 mL/min) produced a lower burst pressure than 50 mL/min (428 mm Hg vs 451 mm Hg). No significant difference was found in burst pressure using infusion rates of 50 mL/min and 100 mL/min.\nThe use of a nonporous sleeve removes the potential weakness presented by the pores themselves. A continuous high infusion rate consistently overestimates burst pressure. These methods may not reflect the physiologic state. Care needs to be taken in interpretation of methodology for burst pressure measurement, and the rate of infusion should be stated in any description of the method.\nThe poor patency of small-caliber vascular bypass prostheses has stimulated a large body of research into alternative graft materials. This includes synthetic and, more recently, tissue-engineered hybrid products. Acceptance for international standards requires demonstration of a rigorous mechanical testing regimen, including graft strength, which has on the whole involved burst strength measurement. However, the methods used to measure burst strength have varied with respect to apparatus used and rate of graft inflation. We show that these variables lead to markedly different results. In particular, fast infusion rates may overestimate the actual burst pressure, leading to a false sense of security.",

    "abstract": "Severe chronic venous disease frequently has a complex pathophysiology. This study describes results after combined interventions to correct outflow obstruction and superficial reflux, even in the presence of deep venous reflux.\nBetween 1997 and 2005, 99 limbs in 96 patients had percutaneous iliofemoral venous stenting combined with great saphenous vein (GSV) stripping (39 limbs), or percutaneous GSV ablation performed by radiofrequency (27 limbs) or laser (33 limbs). Clinical severity score in CEAP was C4 in 51 limbs, C5 in eight limbs, and C6 in 40 limbs; median age was 56 years (range, 27 to 87 years); left-right limb ratio, 2.3:1; female-male ratio, 1.8:1; primary-secondary etiology, 58:41. Perioperative investigations included visual analogue pain scale (VAS), degree of swelling (grade 0 to 3); quality-of-life questionnaire; venous filling index in milliliters per second (VFI90), venous filling time in seconds (VFT), percentage in ambulatory venous pressure drop (AVP), duplex Doppler scanning, and radiologic studies.\nClinical follow-up was performed in 97 (98%) of 99 for up to 5.5 years. Axial deep reflux was found in 27% (27/99). At least three venous segments were refluxing in 40% of limbs. Preoperative hemodynamic parameters reflected the presence of reflux and improved significantly (P < .01) after the procedure (VFI90, 3.8 to 2.3 mL/s; VFT, 11 to 16 seconds; AVP, 55% to 65%). No patients died, and the morbidity with endovenous GSV ablation was largely limited to ecchymosis and thrombophlebitis in the thigh area. Cumulative primary, assisted primary, and secondary stent patency rates at 4 years were 83%, 97%, and 97%, respectively. After treatment, limb swelling and pain substantially improved. The rate of limbs with severe pain (>or=5 on VAS) fell from 44% to 3% after intervention. Gross swelling (grade 3) decreased from 30% to 6% of limbs. Cumulative analysis showed sustained complete relief of pain (VAS = 0) and swelling (grade 0) after 4 years in 73% and 47% of limbs, respectively. Ulcers healed in 26 (68%) of 38 ulcerated limbs. Cumulative ulcer-healing rate was 64% at 48 months. All quality-of-life categories significantly improved after treatment.\nThe single-stage combination of percutaneous venous stenting and superficial ablation in patients with severe chronic venous disease is safe, gives excellent symptom relief and improvement of quality of life, and a well-maintained ulcer-healing rate. It seems logical to initially perform multiple minimally invasive interventions rather than open surgery. Any associated deep reflux can initially be ignored pending clinical response to the combined intervention.",

    "abstract": "It is unknown if the pressure values of compression stockings indicated by the producers correspond to the actual compression pressure exerted in vivo. This study compared pressure and stiffness of ready-made compression stockings (Venosan) of different classes, measured on the leg and by laboratory testing.\nThis was an experimental study conducted in a textile laboratory of a company that manufactures compression stockings. Twelve legs from healthy volunteers were fitted with ready-made calf-length compression stockings of the European classes I, II and III. In addition, two class I stockings were applied over each other. The in vivo interface pressure was measured using the medical stocking tester (MST) in position B1, eight cm proximal to the inner ankle. Stiffness was defined by an increase of pressure due to an increase of stretch that reflects the elastic property of the textile and was assessed by measuring the difference of interface pressure between standing and supine position at B1. In the laboratory, the MST was used to check the pressure of these stockings on wooden leg models. Then circular slices were cut out from the stockings at the B1 level and stretched by a Zwick dynamometer in the transverse direction. Force/extension-curves were plotted, from which the pressure and stiffness of each individual stocking was calculated.\nThe pressure profile measured on four positions along the leg by MST showed a degressive gradient on the wooden model but not on the human leg due to the measuring geometry in the ankle region. Pressure values on the leg correspond to the in vitro measurements calculated from the force/extension-curve with a bias (difference of the means) of -2.1 and 4.1 mm Hg. In 95% of the subjects, the difference was between -10.1 and 5.8 mm Hg (Bland Altman plot). The correlation between in vivo and in vitro measurement was highly significant (P < .0001, Spearman correlation coefficient; r = .8161). In vivo and in vitro measurement shows an increase of stiffness with increasing compression classes. The highest values are found for two class I stockings applied over each other.\nPressure and stiffness can be measured in vivo, correlate well with laboratory findings, and should be used in future studies, especially when different compression devices are to be compared.",

    "abstract": "To compare venous ulcer recurrence and compliance with two strengths of compression hosiery.\nThis study was a randomized controlled trial with a 5-year follow-up. The setting was the leg ulcer clinics of a teaching and a district general hospital in Scotland, United Kingdom. Patients were 300 outpatients with recently healed venous ulcers, with no significant arterial disease, rheumatoid disease, or diabetes mellitus. Interventions were fitting and supply of class 2 or class 3 compression hosiery. Four-monthly refitting by trained orthotists and surveillance by specialist nurses were performed. The main outcome measures were recurrence of leg ulceration and compliance with treatment.\nThirty-six percent (107/300) of patients had recurrent leg ulceration by 5 years. Recurrence occurred in 59 (39%) of 151 class 2 elastic compression cases and in 48 (32%) of class 3 compression cases. One hundred six patients did not comply with their randomized compression class, 63 (42%) in class 3 and 43 (28%) in class 2. The difference in recurrence is not statistically significant, but our estimate of the effectiveness of class 3 hosiery is diluted by the lower compliance rate in this group. Restricted ankle movement and four or more previous ulcers were associated with a higher risk of recurrence.\nThere was no evidence of a difference in recurrence rates at the classic level of significance (5%), but the lowest recurrence rates were seen in people who wore the highest degree of compression. Therefore, patients should wear the highest level of compression that is comfortable.",

One hundred six patients did not comply with their randomized compression class, 63 (42%) in class 3 and 43 (28%) in class 2. The difference in recurrence is not statistically significant, but our estimate of the effectiveness of class 3 hosiery is diluted by the lower compliance rate in this group.

    "abstract": "Quantitative measurements of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are sensitive in detecting the presence of CVI but have low specificity in differentiating clinical severities of CVI as defined by the CEAP classification. One possible reason for this is measurement techniques do not assess variables that reflect hemodynamic changes that occur during normal exercise. Our aim was to compare the association of variables determined from a new technique, continuous ambulatory venous pressure monitoring (CAVPM), and those of conventional AVP measurement with the clinical severity of chronic venous insufficiency in patients with primary venous reflux.\nFifty-four limbs of 49 patients with CVI and 15 healthy controls were studied. CVI clinical severity was classified according to CEAP as C2&C3 (mild disease), C4 (moderate disease), and C5&C6 (severe disease). All participants underwent duplex ultrasound scanning to rule out the presence of reflux in the control group and to confirm it in the patient groups. Conventional AVP measurements, including 90% refilling time (RT90), were compared with the new CAVP variables of mean walking pressure (MWP) and percentage fall in walking pressure (%FWP). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and comparisons between groups were performed using Mann-Whitney tests. Discriminant analysis was used to determine the ability of a test to classify limbs into clinical classes.\nConventional AVP measurements could not differentiate between the control group and the presence of mild disease (P = .56) but did differentiate between controls and severe disease as well as mild and severe disease (P < .001). RT90 detected differences between controls and reflux groups (P < .001) but not between moderate (C4) and severe (C5&C6) clinical groups (P > .5). MWP and %FWP showed significant differences between all clinical severities and controls (P < .001).\nIn the assessment of CVI, mean walking pressure and percent fall in walking pressure are more reliably associated with anatomic distribution of reflux and clinical severity of CVI than the gold standard investigations of conventional AVP and RT90.",

    "abstract": "Physical function is limited in patients with peripheral arterial disease who are symptomatic with intermittent claudication (PAD-IC). When patients with PAD-IC experience claudication, previous reports have described gait abnormalities, including alterations in step length and cadence. This study tested the hypothesis that patients with PAD-IC would have a decrease in usual and maximal walking speed and that this alteration in gait parameters would contribute to their decreased physical function scores, even in the absence of claudication. The aims were to evaluate usual and maximal walking speed and gait parameters (step length, cadence and toe out angle) in subjects with PAD-IC and control subjects with similar baseline activity levels.\nA cross-sectional study of 25 subjects with PAD-IC compared with 26 age-matched controls was conducted in a research laboratory in an academic medical center. Study subjects were similar in age, gender, and physical activity status. Subjects with PAD-IC had an ankle-brachial index <0.90 in at least one leg and reported symptoms of intermittent claudication that limited walking ability. Subjects in either group were excluded if they used assistive devices to walk or were limited in walking ability by orthopedic, neurologic, cardiac, or pulmonary symptoms. Gait parameters were assessed at the onset of walking (before the development of claudication pain in the PAD-IC group) at self-selected and maximal walking speeds during which step and stride characteristics were collected. Subjects completed a physical activity recall, a Short Form questionnaire (SF-36), and a 6-minute walk that was limited by claudication in the PAD-IC group.\nDuring gait testing, no patient with PAD-IC developed claudication. There were no significant differences between the PAD-IC and control groups in usual or maximal walking speed or other gait variables (step length, cadence, stride width, toe out angle). In contrast, the SF-36 physical function score was reduced 15.2 percentage points (P < .02) and the summary physical component score was reduced 6.7 percentage points in the PAD-IC group compared with controls (P = .002). In addition, the 6-minute walk distance was significantly less in the PAD-IC group than in the control group by 308.8 feet (P < .001). A series of bivariate analyses demonstrated that PAD-IC was the best predictor of reduced physical function, whereas no gait parameter was associated with reduced physical function.\nPatients with PAD-IC have significantly reduced 6-minute walk distance and reduced physical function by questionnaire scores that was not explained by any effects of PAD-IC on walking speed and selected gait parameters assessed before the onset of claudication pain.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous endovascular therapy is becoming a primary option for managing infrainguinal occlusive disease. This study examined the results of femoropopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with intermediate (mean, 24 months) follow-up in a contemporary series of patients presenting with critical limb ischemia or claudication.\nFemoropopliteal PTA was performed on 238 consecutive limbs (208 patients) from January 2002 to July 2004. Study end points, including primary patency, assisted patency, and limb salvage (Society of Vascular Surgery reporting standards), were assessed by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, and factors predictive of hemodynamic or clinical failure, or both, were evaluated by univariate and multivariate methods.\nClinical and demographic features included a mean age, 72 years; male (62%); critical limb ischemia (46%); diabetes mellitus (49%); and renal insufficiency (creatinine >or= 1.5 mg/dL) (29%). Lesions were classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) A (11%), B (43%), C (41%), and D (5%). PTA was confined to the femoropopliteal segment in 77 patients (33%), and 161 (67%) underwent concurrent interventions in other anatomic locations. Femoropopliteal interventions included angioplasty only in 183 (78%), and the remaining 53 (22%) received at least one stent. Technical success was achieved in 97% of patients, with no deaths and a major morbidity rate of 3%. The 36-month actuarial primary patency was 54.3%, and assisted patency was 92.6% (37 peripheral reinterventions), resulting in a limb preservation rate of 95.4% in all patients regardless of clinical presentation. Interval conversion to bypass surgery occurred in 19 patients (8%). Comparison between critical limb ischemia and claudication revealed a primary patency of 40.8% vs 64.8%, assisted patency of 93.8% vs 92.6%, and limb salvage of 89.7% vs 100%, respectively. Negative predictors of primary patency determined by multivariate analysis included history of congestive heart failure (P = .02) and TASC C/D (P = .02). However, further evaluation of TASC C/D vs A/B revealed an assisted patency of 89.7% vs 94.3% (P = .37) and limb salvage of 94.3% vs 96.4% (P = .58).\nFemoropopliteal PTA can be performed with a low perioperative morbidity and mortality. Intermediate primary patency is directly related to TASC classification. Although secondary intervention is often necessary to maintain patency in TASC C/D lesions, these data suggest that it would be appropriate to use PTA as initial therapy for chronic femoropopliteal occlusive disease regardless of clinical classification at presentation or TASC category of lesion severity.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of antibiotic-loaded polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads in the management of lower extremity extracavitary prosthetic arterial graft infection.\nThis was a retrospective review of 34 patients treated for vascular surgical site (VSS) infections involving 36 prosthetic lower extremity arterial bypasses using antibiotic-loaded PMMA beads and culture-specific parenteral antibiotics for 4 to 6 weeks. Sites of graft infection were explored, debrided, and cultured. As determined from the results of Gram's stains of VSS purulence, PMMA powder was polymerized with an antibiotic (vancomycin, daptomycin, or tobramycin/gentamicin, or a combination), molded into a chain of beads, and implanted adjacent to the infected graft after debridement and pulsed-spray antibacterial lavage. All wounds were closed primarily with planned exploration to verify sterilization before a graft preservation or in situ replacement procedure. Treatment outcomes, including wound sterilization, were analyzed based on tissue culture isolates, procedures for persistent infection, and freedom from graft infection.\nCultures isolated 42 pathogens, (32 gram-positive, 9 gram-negative, 1 Candida albicans) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cultured from 16 (44%) of 36 surgical site infections. As determined from the initial operative Gram's stain or a prior culture result, vancomycin PMMA beads were implanted in 29 of 36 VSS infections at the first procedure; daptomycin (n = 4) or tobramycin (n = 3) beads were implanted in the rest. Repeat VSS exploration and culture results led to an average of 2.5 antibiotic bead replacements before definitive treatment. A sterile (no growth on tissue culture) VSS was achieved in 87% of cases before a graft preservation (n = 16) or in-situ replacement of an infected graft (n = 20) procedure. No patient deaths occurred. Early and late limb salvage was 100%. Infection recurred in 4 (11%) VSSs during a mean 23-month follow-up period, one within 3 months owing to unrecognized bowel injury associated with in situ replacement of an aortofemoral graft limb.\nAntibiotic-loaded PMMA beads may be a useful adjunct in the contemporary surgical management of VSS infection involving a prosthetic graft. Wound sterilization was achieved in most VSSs before graft preservation or an in-situ replacement procedure, including infections caused by MRSA, a pathogen isolated in half of the extracavitary prosthetic graft infections. This preliminary trial shows the potential benefit of this new technique, but further study is required to prove efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to identify patient and procedural parameters that negatively impact the 30-day rates for stroke, death and transient ischemic attack (TIA) after carotid artery stenting (CAS) and that might be modified or further studied in future efforts to improve CAS.\nThis was a retrospective investigation of a dual-center CAS database of 701 consecutive CAS patients (414 men; mean age, 72.4 +/- 8.4). A subset of patient-related, lesion-related, or procedure-related variables (age >or=80, left sided lesion, symptomatic, nicotine abuse, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, other peripheral vascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, embolic protection devices usage, predilation, ulcerated lesion, echolucent plaque, restenosis after surgery) were analyzed for association with occurrence of stroke, death, or TIA <or=30 days after CAS. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) and P value were calculated for each variable to predict adverse outcome.\nThe overall combined rate of stroke, death, and TIA within this database was 3.7% at 30 days. In the total population of 701 patients, only the OR of 2.7 for hypercholesterolemia (95% CI, 1.0 to 7.3; P = .041) was found to be significant. Subgroup analysis of the 304 symptomatic patients (43%) showed that open-cell stent designs and concentric EPD designs yielded an OR of 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4 to 12, P = .0136) and 3.3 (95% CI, 1.016 to 10, P = .0525), respectively, for 30-day stroke/death/TIA within this database. Analysis of open-cell stent designs and concentric EPD designs in patients with echolucent lesions yielded an OR of 3.1 (95% CI,1.2 to 8.2, P = .0343) and 3.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 10, P = .0174), respectively, for 30-day stroke/death/TIA.\nWe conclude that increased analysis of device design variables may be necessary. Particularly in symptomatic patients or with echolucent lesions, closed-cell design and eccentric filters seem superior. Prospective investigation comparing open-cell vs closed-cell stents and eccentric vs concentric filter devices may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms involving branches of the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries are uncommon and require proper management to prevent rupture and death. This study compares surgical and endovascular treatment of these aneurysms and analyzes outcome.\nPatients at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York who were treated for aneurysms in the branches of the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery were identified through a search of the institution's medical records and endovascular database. Patient demographics, history, clinical presentation, aneurysm characteristics, treatments, and follow-up outcome were retrospectively recorded. Significant differences between patients treated by surgical or endovascular therapy were determined by using Student's t test and chi2 analysis.\nBetween January 1, 1991, and July 1, 2005, 59 patients with 61 aneurysms were treated at a single institution. Twenty-four patients had surgical repair, and 35 underwent endovascular treatment, which included coil embolization and stent-graft therapy. Splenic (28) and hepatic (22) artery aneurysms predominated. Eighty-nine percent of splenic artery aneurysms were true aneurysms and were treated by endovascular and surgical procedures in near equal numbers (14 and 11, respectively). Pseudoaneurysms were significantly more likely to be treated by endovascular means (P < .01). The technical success rate of endovascular treatment for aneurysms was 89%, and failures were successfully treated by repeat coil embolization in all patients who presented for retreatment. Patients treated by endovascular techniques had a significantly higher incidence of malignancy than patients treated with open surgical techniques (P = .03). Furthermore, patients treated by endovascular means had a shorter in-hospital length of stay (2.4 vs 6.6 days, P < .001).\nEndovascular management of visceral aneurysms is an effective means of treating aneurysms involving branches of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and is particularly useful in patients with comorbidities, including cancer. It is associated with a decreased length of stay in the elective setting, and failure of primary treatment can often be successfully managed percutaneously.",

    "abstract": "Many factors impair healing of chronic venous ulcer (CVU), and many theories have been proposed to explain their pathogenesis. Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) influences tissue regeneration and angiogenesis with effects on wound healing. Because FXIII properties depend upon its genetic variants, we investigated whether intragene polymorphisms may have modulating effects on the CVU area.\nThe study included 121 patients with nonhealing CVUs (CEAP clinical class C6) that included 67% with primary chronic venous disease (CVD), 26% with post-thrombotic ulcers, and 7% with mixed ulcer origin. Polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype them for Val34Leu, Pro564Leu, and Tyr204Phe variants in the FXIII-A subunit gene and for His95Arg variant in the FXIII-B subunit gene. The same variants were analyzed in 102 controls, healthy subjects who were case-matched by age and gender.\nGenotype distribution for all polymorphisms investigated was not significantly different between cases and controls. Conversely, our CVU cases had a mean ulcer area inversely related with the presence of both Leu34 and Leu564 alleles (ValVal, 12.3 +/- 22.4 cm2 vs LeuLeu, 3.9 +/- 2.6 cm2, P = .002; ProPro, 10.2 +/- 21.2 cm2 vs LeuLeu, 2.9 +/- 1.4 cm2, P = .002). In combined analysis, those cases who were wild-type for both variants (ValVal34/ProPro564) had a further increase in mean ulcer size compared with cases carrying both variants (Leu34/Leu564) (13.3 +/- 27.1 cm2 vs 5.2 +/- 5.6 cm2; P = .034).\nNo correlation exists between FXIII genotypes and the prevalence of chronic venous ulcers, thus demonstrating that FXIII polymorphisms have no role in ulcer development. In contrast, FXIII-gene variants, in particular the non-wild-type alleles Leu34 and Leu564, were associated with a smaller venous ulcer surface and might have favorable effects on reparative processes.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports indicated a correlation between the amount of energy released during endovenous laser treatment (ELT) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and the success and durability of the procedure. Our objective was to analyze the influence of increased energy dosing on immediate occlusion and recanalization rates after ELT of the GSV.\nGSVs were treated with either 15 or 30 W of laser power by using a 940-nm diode laser with continuous fiber pullback and tumescent local anesthesia. Patients were followed up prospectively with duplex ultrasonography at day 1 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.\nA total of 114 GSVs were treated with 15 W, and 149 GSVs were treated with 30 W. The average endovenous fluence equivalents were 12.8 +/- 5.1 J/cm2 and 35.1 +/- 15.6 J/cm2, respectively. GSV occlusion rates according to the method of Kaplan and Meier for the 15- and 30-W groups were 95.6% and 100%, respectively, at day 1, 90.4% and 100% at 3 months, and 82.7% and 97.0% at 12 months after ELT (log-rank; P = .001). An endovenous fluence equivalent exceeding 20 J/cm2 was associated with durable GSV occlusion after 12 months' follow-up, thus suggesting a schedule for dosing of laser energy with respect to the vein diameter.\nHigher dosing of laser energy shows a 100% immediate success rate and a significantly reduced recanalization rate during 12 months' follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Patients affected by peripheral arterial disease (PAD) incur a heightened risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular mortality. We examined risk factors, medications, and prognosis of outpatients with PAD enrolled in two national, prospective, practice-based Canadian registries that encompassed 484 physician practices: the Vascular Protection and Guideline Oriented Approach in Lipid Lowering registries.\nThe 2 registries were combined to analyze 9810 patients with vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or age 65 years or older plus at least 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors. Risk factors, medications, and major cardiovascular events were recorded at baseline and again at 6 months' follow-up.\nCompared with patients without PAD (n = 8303), those with PAD (n = 1507) had substantially worse risk factor profiles and were more likely to have coexisting coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Both groups received high rates of treatment with evidence-based therapies, including antiplatelet drugs, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Despite this, patients with PAD had a nearly twofold higher risk of major cardiovascular events at 6 months than non-PAD patients (7.3% vs 4.1%; P < .0001). After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, the presence of PAD at baseline continued to predict a heightened risk of adverse vascular sequelae (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.01; P < .0001).\nThese data support a strong relationship between PAD and worsened vascular prognosis that is independent of both conventional vascular risk factors and concomitant cardiovascular disease. The presence of PAD should therefore provide a clear impetus for intensive risk factor modification and use of preventive medical therapy in affected patients.",

Both groups received high rates of treatment with evidence-based therapies, including antiplatelet drugs, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Despite this, patients with PAD had a nearly twofold higher risk of major cardiovascular events at 6 months than non-PAD patients (7.3% vs 4.1%; P < .0001).

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is rapidly becoming the predominant technique for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Results from current studies, however, are conflicting on the effect of EVAR on renal function compared with standard open repair. Furthermore, data for open repair in patients with baseline renal insufficiency suggests worse outcomes, including renal function. This analysis compared the effects of open repair vs EVAR on renal function in patients with baseline renal insufficiency.\nWe reviewed our records for patients with preoperative chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL) who underwent open repair or EVAR between 1999 and 2004. The same group of vascular surgeons at a single institution performed aneurysm repair on 98 patients: 46 open (37 men, 9 women) and 52 EVAR (50 men, 2 women). Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up serum creatinine and creatinine clearance were compared, as was the development of postoperative renal impairment (increase in serum creatinine >30%).\nSerum creatinine and creatinine clearance were not statistically different between the open and EVAR groups during any time period studied. Likewise when comparing the magnitude of change in serum creatinine in patients between the postoperative and follow-up times with preoperative values, no significant differences existed between the open and EVAR groups. When the change in serum creatinine over time within each group was compared, however, the open group had a significant increase in serum creatinine postoperatively (2.43 +/- 1.20 vs 2.04 +/- 0.64, P = .012), which returned to baseline during follow-up (1.96 +/- 0.94, P = .504). Although serum creatinine in the EVAR group increased compared with preoperative values of 2.04 +/- 0.55 (postoperative, 2.27 +/- 1.04; follow-up, 2.40 +/- 1.37), this failed to reach statistical significance for the postoperative (P = .092) or follow-up (P = .081) periods. A similar pattern was noted in creatinine clearance. Postoperative renal impairment was noted in 13 open (28%) and 15 EVAR patients (29%) and was not statistically different between groups. Overall, two patients (4.3%) from the open group and four (7.7%) from the EVAR group required hemodialysis; one in the EVAR group required permanent hemodialysis. This difference was not statistically significant (P = .681).\nOpen and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with pre-existent renal insufficiency can be performed safely with preservation of renal function. In contrast to previous reports, no significant differences existed between open repair and EVAR in postoperative alterations in renal function. Although a significant increase in serum creatinine develops in patients with renal insufficiency postoperatively with open repair, this appears to be transient, and preoperative renal dysfunction alone should not exclude either approach. After EVAR, patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency continue to be at risk for progressive renal dysfunction, and protective measures should be taken to preserve renal function in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Selecting patients based on their risk profiles could improve the outcome after elective surgery of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) is a scoring system developed to determine such risk profiles. In other settings, the GAS has proved to have a predictive value for the postoperative outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the GAS was also valid for the patients in our hospital and to examine risk factors with a possible predictive value for postoperative mortality and morbidity.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study in a university hospital. The medical records of 229 patients who underwent open elective repair for an AAA in the period 1994 to 2003 were retrospectively analyzed to assess the GAS and to determine which of the examined risk factors had a predictive value for the prognosis.\nFive patients (2.2%) died after surgery and 30 (13.1%) had a major complication. The GAS was predictive for postoperative death (P = .021; sensitivity, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.00; specificity, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.73) and also for major morbidity (P = .029; sensitivity, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.78; specificity, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.76). The positive predictive value (mortality, 0.06; morbidity, 0.24) and the positive likelihood ratio (mortality, 3.07; morbidity, 2.14) were low, however. The best cutoff value for the GAS was determined at 77. All the deceased patients (100%) and 63.3% of those who had a major complication had a risk score of >or=77. Of all examined risk factors, suprarenal clamping during surgery was predictive of in-hospital mortality (8.3%, P = .017). For major morbidity, three risk factors, all of which are components of the GAS, were predictive: age (P = .046), cardiac disease (P = .032), and renal disease (P = .041).\nThe Glasgow Aneurysm Score has a predictive value for outcome after open elective AAA repair. Because of its relatively low positive predictive value for death and major morbidity, the GAS is of limited value in clinical decision-making for the individual high-risk patient. In some particular cases, however, the GAS can be a useful tool, especially for low-risk patients because it has good negative predictive value for this group. Suprarenal clamping was found to be a risk factor for postoperative death.",

Toe-brachial pressure indices demonstrated a positive correlation with foot transcutaneous oxygen values, but values >1.2 demonstrated a negative correlation.\nWe demonstrated two influences on cutaneous foot perfusion in diabetes: (1) a global microcirculatory dysfunction, reflected in low chest and foot transcutaneous oxygen values, and (2) macrovascular disease as indicated by reduced toe-brachial pressure indices and foot transcutaneous oxygen values. Further, the results demonstrated that in diabetic individuals without critical limb ischemia, impaired foot perfusion secondary to arterial disease is amplified significantly by coexisting microcirculatory disease.",

    "abstract": "Open surgical repair for infected thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysms carries significant mortality and morbidity. Endovascular stent graft repair has been our preferred approach, although its role remains controversial because persistent infection is always a concern. We aimed to assess the efficacy and durability of endovascular stent graft repair in these patients.\nBetween August 2000 and November 2005, seven consecutive patients with eight infected pseudoaneurysms of the thoracic aorta were treated with endovascular stent graft repair. Patients were diagnosed based on a typical appearance of an infected pseudoaneurysm on imaging together with a positive bacteriology culture or clinical evidence of sepsis. The follow-up protocol included regular clinical examination, hematologic tests, and computed tomography scans.\nThere were six men and one woman with a median age of 68 years at operation. Three patients presented with an aortoenteric fistula. The operations were performed in the operating room with the image guidance of a mobile C-arm. Endovascular stent grafts were deployed successfully in all patients, with complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysms. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 1 to 6 weeks and followed by lifelong maintenance oral antibiotics. The median hospital stay was 27 days, with no hospital deaths. No paraplegia or other major complications occurred. Two patients with aortoesophageal fistula where the fistula tracts were persistent died during follow-up. The other five patients remained well, with no evidence of graft infection at a median follow-up of 34 months. A significant reduction in the diameter of the pseudoaneurysm (>5 mm) was noted on computed tomography scans after 12 months.\nEndovascular stent graft repair is effective and may be a durable option for infected pseudoaneurysms of the thoracic aorta.",

    "abstract": "The geometric and biomechanical changes that contribute to vein graft remodeling are not well established. We sought to measure patterns of adaptation in lower extremity vein grafts and assess their correlation with clinical outcomes.\nWe conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of patients undergoing infrainguinal reconstruction with autogenous conduit. In addition to standard duplex surveillance, lumen diameter (of a defined index segment of the conduit) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed by ultrasound imaging at surgery and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Graft dimensions and wall stiffness were correlated with clinical outcomes.\nThere were 92 patients and 96 limbs in this study. On average, vein graft lumen diameter increased during the first month of implantation from 0.37 +/- .01 cm to 0.45 +/- 0.02 cm (mean +/- SEM; P = .002), representing a relative change of +21.6% (median +/- 14%; range, -31 to +67%) during this period. Of the entire cohort, 72% of grafts demonstrated appreciable dilation of the index segment during the first month. Index segment lumen diameter did not change appreciably beyond 1 month, with the notable exception of arm vein conduits, which showed continued tendency to dilate. PWV increased during the first 6 months (17.2 +/- 1.2 m/s to 23.2 +/- 2.4 m/s; P = .008), reflecting a nearly 40% increase in conduit stiffness (2.0 +/- .6 Mdynes/cm to 3.3 +/- .8 Mdynes/cm, P = .01). The greatest relative increase (25%) in PWV occurred from months 1 to 3. Loss of primary patency occurred in 24 cases (19 revisions, 5 occlusions), with a mean reintervention time of 7.6 months. Grafts that demonstrated early positive remodeling (lumen dilatation) had a trend of increased primary patency (P = .08, log rank). Among the grafts that failed, a trend was noted toward greater wall stiffness at 1 month, 2.7 vs 1.5 Mdynes (P = .08).\nVein graft remodeling appears to involve at least two distinct temporal phases. Outward remodeling of the lumen occurs early, and wall stiffness changes occur in a more delayed fashion. Early outward remodeling may be important for successful vein graft adaptation.",

PWV increased during the first 6 months (17.2 +/- 1.2 m/s to 23.2 +/- 2.4 m/s; P = .008), reflecting a nearly 40% increase in conduit stiffness (2.0 +/- .6 Mdynes/cm to 3.3 +/- .8 Mdynes/cm, P = .01). The greatest relative increase (25%) in PWV occurred from months 1 to 3. Loss of primary patency occurred in 24 cases (19 revisions, 5 occlusions), with a mean reintervention time of 7.6 months. Grafts that demonstrated early positive remodeling (lumen dilatation) had a trend of increased primary patency (P = .08, log rank). Among the grafts that failed, a trend was noted toward greater wall stiffness at 1 month, 2.7 vs 1.5 Mdynes (P = .08).",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy is a less invasive alternative treatment for high-risk patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms. However, this technology alone is often not applicable to complex aneurysmal morphology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of hybrid strategies in high-risk patients who are otherwise unsuitable for endovascular therapy alone.\nDuring an 18-month period, 31 high-risk patients (mean age, 69 years; range, 52-89 years) underwent combined open and endovascular approaches for complex aneurysms, including 16 patients with ascending and arch aneurysms and 15 patients with aneurysms involving visceral vessels. Among them, 11 patients had histories of aneurysm repairs. To overcome the anatomic limitations of endovascular repairs, various adjunctive surgical maneuvers were used, including aortic arch reconstruction in 3 patients, supra-aortic trunk debranching in 13 patients (including 8 patients who required aortas as inflow sources), and visceral vessel bypasses in 15 patients (including 10 patients who required bypasses to all 3 visceral branches). Additionally, carotid artery access was obtained in 1 patient, and iliac artery conduits were created in 12 patients.\nTechnical success was achieved in all patients. There was one perioperative death (3.2%) due to postoperative bleeding. Two patients (6.4%) had immediate type II endoleaks, which were resolved by the 1-month follow-up. Other procedure-related complications occurred in three patients (9.6%), including renal bypass thromboses in two patients and retroperitoneal hematoma, which was successfully managed conservatively, in one patient. During a mean follow-up of 16 months, two patients died of unrelated causes, whereas the remainder of patients were asymptomatic, without aneurysm enlargement.\nOur study highlights how hybrid strategies incorporating surgical and endovascular approaches can be used successfully in treating patients with complex thoracic aortic aneurysms. This combined approach potentially expands the field of endovascular stent grafting and is an attractive solution for patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserves.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the efficacy and safety of autologous bone marrow-mononuclear cells (ABMMNC) implantation in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).\nThe study comprised 28 patients (25 men and 3 women) with a median age of 44 years (range, 25-54 years) who had thromboangiitis obliterans and unilateral critical limb ischemia, defined as ischemic rest pain in a limb with or without nonhealing ulcers. The patients received multiple injections of erythrocyte-depleted and volume-reduced ABMMNC into the gastrocnemius muscle, the intermetatarsal region, and the feet dorsum (n = 26) or forearm (n = 2) vs saline injections into the less ischemic contralateral limbs. The patients were nonresponders to previous Iloprost infusion and smoking cessation >or=6 months and were not candidates for nonsurgical or surgical revascularization. Primary end points were the total healing of the most important lesion while avoiding major or minor amputation, the relief of rest pain without the need for analgesics from baseline to 6 months' follow-up, and the safety and feasibility of the treatment. Secondary end points were the changes in ankle-brachial pressure index and peak walking time, the angiographic evidence of collateral vessel formation or remodeling, and the quality-of-life assessment. Two investigators blinded for treatment assignment performed image analyses.\nUnilateral intramuscular administration of ABMMNC was not associated with any complications. The mean follow-up time was 16.6 +/- 7.8 months (range, 7.6 to 33.8 months). Only one patient required toe amputation during follow-up. A change in the ankle-brachial pressure index >0.15 was achieved in 8 patients at 3 months and in 14 patients at 6 months compared with baseline values. At 6 months, patients demonstrated a significant improvement in rest pain scores (P < .0001), peak walking time (P < .0001), and quality of life (P < .0083). Total healing of the most important lesion was achieved in 15 patients (83%) with ischemic ulcers, and relief of rest pain without the need of narcotic analgesics improved in all patients. Digital subtraction angiography studies before and 6 months after the ABMMNC implantation showed vascular collateral networks had formed across the affected arteries in 22 patients (78.5%).\nABMMNC implantation could be a safe alternative to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans and critical limb ischemia refractory to other treatment modalities.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructions of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are associated with many odd features. Even total occlusions may remain entirely silent or present late with acute symptoms. Renal dysfunction is rare. Many have chronic symptoms, but often only one limb is affected. We describe the clinical features in a series of 120 patients seen over a 10-year period and the results of successful stent placement in 99 limbs.\nPatients with acute onset of symptoms due to distal thromboses underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis. Patients with significant chronic symptoms were investigated by duplex, venous function tests, transfemoral venography and finally intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Stenotic segments were balloon dilated and occluded segments were recannalized when feasible; stents were placed under IVUS control.\nIn the asymptomatic group, 10 patients with total occlusions had transient or no occlusive symptoms. In the acute symptom group, four patients with chronic IVC occlusions presented with acute onset of deep venous thrombosis distal to the occlusion but became asymptomatic when the clot was lysed. In the chronic symptom group, 97 patients (99 limbs) had symptoms of chronic venous disease of variable distribution and intensity. In two-thirds, limb symptoms were unilateral. Pathology was total occlusion in 14%, and the rest were stenoses. The lesion extended above the renal vein in 18%. Common iliac obstruction was concurrent in 93%. Distal reflux was present in 66%. Modifications of the basic stent technique were required in recanalization of total occlusions (four extending up to the atrium), two bilateral stent deployments, and nine IVC filter cases. Stent deployment across the renal and hepatic veins or the contralateral iliac vein had no adverse sequelae. Stent patency (cumulative) at 2 years was 82%. Complete relief (cumulative) of pain and swelling at 3.5 years was 74% and 51%, respectively. The cumulative rate of complete ulcer healing at 2 years was 63%. Overall clinical outcome was rated as good or excellent in 70%.\nThe unusual clinical features of IVC obstructions seem related to the rich collateralization, which has an embryonic basis. Common iliac vein patency seems to be a crucial link in collateral function, and its concurrent occlusion produces symptoms. Percutaneous stent placement has an emerging role in the treatment of IVC obstructive lesions, with good mid-term stent patency and clinical results.",

    "abstract": "When reporting standards for successful lower extremity revascularization were established, it was assumed that arterial reconstruction, patency, and limb salvage would correlate with the ultimate goal of therapy: improved functional performance. In reality, factors determining improvement of ambulation and maintenance of independent living status after revascularization have been poorly studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the important determinants of functional outcome for patients after intervention for critical limb ischemia.\nThe results of 1000 revascularized limbs from 841 patients were studied. Indications were rest pain, 41.1%; ischemic ulceration, 35.6%; gangrene, 23.3%; infrainguinal, 70.9%; aortoiliac, 24.2%; and both, 4.9%. Treatment was by endovascular intervention, 35.5%; open surgery, 61.7%; and both, 2.8%. Patient were mean age of 68 +/- 12 years, and 56.6% were men, 74.7% were white, 54.2% had diabetes mellitus, 67% were smokers, 13.4% had end-stage renal disease and were on dialysis, and 36% had prior vascular surgery. Patients were treated with conventional therapy by fellowship-trained vascular specialists at a single center and were analyzed according to the type of intervention, the arterial level treated, age, race, gender, presentation, the presence of diabetes, smoking history, end-stage renal disease, coronary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous stroke, dementia, prior vascular surgery, preoperative ambulatory status, limb loss <or=1 year of treatment, and independent living status. The technical outcomes of reconstruction patency and limb salvage as well as the functional outcomes of survival, maintenance of ambulation, and independent living status were measured for each variable using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, and differences were assessed using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess independent predictors of outcome and obtain adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.\nAt 5 years, 72.4% of the entire cohort had a patent reconstruction and 72.1% had an intact limb. Overall 5-year functional outcomes were 41.9% for survival, 70.6% for maintenance of ambulation, and 81.3% for independent living status. Outcome was not significantly affected by the type of treatment (endovascular or open surgery) or by the level of disease treated (aortoiliac, infrainguinal, or both). The most important independent, statistically significant predictors of particularly poor functional outcome were impaired ambulatory ability at the time of presentation (70% 5-year mortality, hazard ratio, 3.34; 39.5% failure to eventually ambulate, hazard ratio, 2.83; 30% loss of independent living status, hazard ratio, 7.97), and the presence of dementia (73% late mortality, hazard ratio, 1.57; 41.2% failure to eventually ambulate, hazard ratio, 2.20; 46.4% loss of independent living status, hazard ratio, 5.44). These factors were even more predictive than limb amputation alone.\nFunctional outcome for patients undergoing intervention for critical limb ischemia is not solely determined by the traditional measures of reconstruction patency and limb salvage, but also by certain intrinsic patient comorbidities at the time of presentation. These findings question the benefit of our current approach to critical limb ischemia in functionally impaired, chronically ill patients--patients who undoubtedly will be more prevalent as our population ages.",

    "abstract": "The original Gore Excluder endoprosthesis (OGE) used both during and briefly after clinical trials was associated with less sac regression and more sac growth than some other devices, even without apparent endoleaks, presumably because of transmural movement of serous fluid across the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene material. In July 2004, the device was modified to decrease graft permeability. This study evaluated the efficacy of the new Excluder Low-Permeability Device (ELPD) at 1 year and compared it with the OGE and the Cook Zenith device (ZEN).\nFrom Food and Drug Administration approval of the Excluder in November 2002 until June 2005, 283 patients underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with the Gore Excluder or the ZEN. Postoperative surveillance included computed tomographic scans at 1 and 12 months; 181 (64%) patients completed both scans. The 1-month computed tomographic scan served as a baseline, and the minor axis diameter, measured at the largest axial cut of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, was compared with the same measurement at 1 year. A sac size change of 5 mm or more was considered significant. Sixty patients treated with the OGE were compared with 72 patients treated with the ELPD. Forty-nine patients treated during the same time period with the ZEN, known for early sac shrinkage, were used as a reference. All measurements were performed by one observer from a digital workstation. Wilcoxon signed rank tests (pairwise) or Kruskal-Wallis tests (three groups) were used for intergroup comparison of continuous variables, whereas chi2 statistics or Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables.\nPatient age and sex and mean maximum aneurysm diameter at baseline were similar among groups (P = .59, .27, and .46, respectively). Graft migration, stent fractures, acute surgical conversion, late abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, or aneurysm-related deaths were not observed. Type II endoleak rates were similar between ELPD and ZEN (23.6% and 20.4%; P = .68). Although a higher rate of endoleaks was seen with OGE (36.7%), this was not significant when compared with the other two devices (P = .11). At 1 year, patients treated with ELPD had a sac regression rate that was significantly higher than that for patients treated with OGE (63.9% vs 25%; P < 0.001) and was similar to that for patients treated with ZEN (65.3%). Significant sac expansion was not observed with ELPD.\nAt 1 year, similar to ZEN, significant aneurysm sac regression and minimal sac expansion were noted after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with ELPD. Low-porosity fabric used in the construction of endoprostheses seems to be an important factor in early aneurysm sac shrinkage. Long-term efficacy regarding the prevention of sac enlargement remains unclear, and further follow-up is suggested.",

However, little information is known about what influences the clinical outcome in these patients.\nThe Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmb\u00f3lica (RIETE) is an ongoing registry of consecutive patients with symptomatic, objectively confirmed, acute DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). In this analysis evaluated the clinical outcome <or=15 days of the start of therapy of all enrolled outpatients with acute DVT in the lower limbs.\nDuring the study period, 124 (2.8%) of 4405 DVT patients had at least one adverse event (symptomatic PE, 15; recurrent DVT, 18; major bleeding, 37; death, 68). On multivariate analysis, bilateral DVT, renal insufficiency, body weight <70 kg, recent immobility, chronic heart failure, and cancer were associated with an increased risk for adverse events. When these variables were added into the derivation sample, the area under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.86). Patients with a risk score of <or=2 had a 1.2% incidence of adverse events (23 in 1935 patients) compared with the 6.8% incidence in high-risk patients. In the validation sample, the area under ROC curve was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.88). Low-risk patients had a 1.0% incidence of adverse events, and those at high-risk had a 4.7% incidence.\nA simple risk score based on easily available variables can identify DVT outpatients at low risk for an adverse outcome. This information may help clinicians to decide which DVT patients may be eligible for ambulatory treatment.",

    "abstract": "This randomized prospective study was designed to compare the effectiveness of treating superficial femoral artery occlusive disease percutaneously with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)/nitinol self-expanding stent grafts vs surgical femoral-to-above knee (AK) popliteal artery bypass with synthetic graft material.\nFrom March 2004 to May 2005, 100 limbs in 86 patients with femoral-popliteal arterial occlusive disease were identified. Patients had symptoms ranging from claudication to rest pain, with or without tissue loss, and were prospectively randomized for treatment into one of two groups. The limbs were treated percutaneously with angioplasty and one or more self-expanding stent grafts (n = 50) or surgically with femoral-to-AK popliteal artery bypass using synthetic Dacron or ePTFE grafts (n = 50). The mean +/- SD total length of artery stented was 25.6 +/- 15 cm. Follow-up evaluation with ankle-brachial indices and color flow duplex sonography imaging were performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment.\nPatients were monitored for a median of 18 months. No statistical difference was found in the primary patency (P = .895) or secondary patency (P = .861) between the two treatment groups. Primary patency at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up was 84%, 82%, 75.6%, and 73.5% for the stent graft group and 90%, 81.8%, 79.7%, and 74.2% for the femoral-popliteal surgical group. Thirteen patients in the stent graft group had 14 reinterventions, and 12 reinterventions occurred in the surgical group. This resulted in secondary patency rates of 83.9% for the stent graft group and 83.7% for the surgical group at the 12-month follow-up.\nManagement of femoral-popliteal arterial occlusive disease using percutaneous treatment with a stent graft is comparable with surgical revascularization with conventional femoral-to-AK popliteal artery bypass using synthetic material up to 12 months. Longer-term follow-up would be helpful in determining ongoing efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as an independent predictor of coronary artery disease; however, its importance in peripheral arterial disease is less clear. The aim of this study was to assess the association between obesity and the severity and outcome of intermittent claudication.\nThis study was a prospective cohort study based at a tertiary referral center. Sixty patients with intermittent claudication selected for conservative treatment were assessed for obesity and metabolic syndrome by using the International Diabetes Federation definition. Other risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, serum lipids, adipocytokines, and C-reactive protein, were measured by clinical and blood assessment. Obesity and metabolic syndrome were related to the severity of peripheral arterial disease, defined by ankle-brachial pressure index and graded treadmill measured maximum walking distance (MWD) and initial claudication distance, by using multiple linear regression analysis allowing for traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. Patients were followed up for 24 months, and combined outcome was reported in terms of death, cardiovascular events, or requirement for revascularization. The effect of obesity and metabolic syndrome on outcome was investigated by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis.\nObesity and serum adiponectin were independently associated with the severity of peripheral arterial disease measured by ankle-brachial pressure index (P = .03 and .001), initial claudication distance (P = .009 and .03), and MWD (P = .001 and .04). Metabolic syndrome was independently associated only with MWD (P = .02). By 24 months, outcome events occurred in 37% +/- 7% and 43% +/- 9% of patients with metabolic syndrome or obesity, respectively, compared with 0% and 11% +/- 6% of those without these diagnoses. Waist circumference independently predicted the likelihood of outcome events (relative risk, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.26; P < .001).\nThese findings, if confirmed in other cohorts, suggest the importance of treating obesity in patients with intermittent claudication. Serum adiponectin concentrations may be an important guide to the efficacy of treatment in patients with intermittent claudication and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and with the severity of peripheral arterial disease. The effects of inflammation on the development of vein graft disease remain speculative. We hypothesized that high levels of inflammatory markers would identify patients at increased risk for adverse events (graft failure, major cardiovascular events) after lower extremity bypass surgery.\nPatients (n = 91) scheduled to undergo lower extremity bypass using autogenous vein were enrolled into a prospective study at two institutions. Exclusion criteria included the presence of major infection. A baseline plasma sample was obtained on the morning of lower extremity bypass. Biomarkers for inflammation included hsCRP, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A (SAA). Values between patients with and without critical limb ischemia were compared. Proportions of events among dichotomized populations (upper limit of normal of each laboratory assay) were compared by log-rank test.\nOf the patients undergoing lower extremity bypass, 69% were men, 53% were diabetic, 81% were smokers, and their mean ankle-brachial index was 0.51 +/- 0.19. The indication for lower extremity bypass was critical limb ischemia in 55%. There were no perioperative deaths and two early graft occlusions. During a mean follow-up of 342 days (range, 36-694 days) there were four deaths, 27 graft-related events, and 10 other cardiovascular events. No relationships were found between events and demographics, comorbidities, baseline ankle-brachial index, or statin use. High-sensitivity CRP (P = .005), fibrinogen (P < .001), and SAA (P = .0001) levels were associated with critical limb ischemia at presentation. Among patients with an elevated hsCRP (>5 mg/L) immediately before surgery, major postoperative vascular events occurred in 60% (21/35), compared with a 32% (18/56) rate in those with a baseline CRP <5 mg/L (P = .004, log-rank test). On multivariable analysis, only elevated hsCRP correlated with adverse graft-related or cardiovascular events (P = .018).\nThe inflammatory biomarkers of hsCRP, fibrinogen, and SAA correlate with peripheral arterial disease severity at presentation in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass. Patients with elevated hsCRP are at increased risk for postoperative vascular events, most of which are related to the vein graft. These findings suggest a potential relationship between inflammation and outcomes after lower extremity vein bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the incidence and characteristics of graft infection in patients who underwent early vs late revisional surgery of lower extremity arterial bypass grafts.\nBetween 1992 and July 2005, 500 revisional procedures were performed on 198 lower extremity bypass grafts. Patients whose revisions were performed <30 days after the primary bypass were in the early revision (ER) group (n = 99), and those done >30 days after bypass were in the late revision (LR) group (n = 99). Infection was defined as cellulitis with graft exposure or purulence in continuity with a graft that required antibiotics and operation for infection control. Mean follow-up was 60 months (range, 2 to 60 months). Groups were compared using Student's t test.\nThe ER group included 66 autogenous and 33 prosthetic grafts. The LR group consisted of 53 autogenous and 46 prosthetic grafts. Of the 500 revisional procedures performed, 17 graft infections occurred (3.4%). Twelve (70.6%) were prosthetic grafts and five (29.4%) were autogenous grafts (P = .004). Defining the infection rate per graft rather than per revisional procedure, the ER group had a significantly higher graft infection rate at 11% (11/99) compared with 6.1% in the LR group (6/99; P = .012). The risk of infection for prosthetic grafts was significantly higher within the ER group at 27.3% (9/33) compared with autogenous grafts at 3.1% (2/66; P = .0001). Infection developed in three vein grafts and three prosthetic grafts in the LR group (P = NS). For prosthetic graft revisions only, infection risk was 27.3% (9/33) in the ER group and 6.5% (3/46) in the LR group (P = .005). The most common cultured pathogen was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ER, 6/11 vs LR, 3/6; P = NS). Within the ER group, the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly higher at 27.3% (3/11) compared with 0% (0/6) in the LR group (P = .04).\nEarly revision of lower extremity arterial bypass grafts has a significantly higher risk of graft infection compared with revision >1 month after surgery. Infection will develop in approximately 25% (9/33) of prosthetic grafts that are reoperated on early. If feasible, reoperation should be delayed >1 month for prosthetic grafts needing revision. Endovascular or extra-anatomic interventions should be considered if early revision is mandated in this group.",

Of the 500 revisional procedures performed, 17 graft infections occurred (3.4%). Twelve (70.6%) were prosthetic grafts and five (29.4%) were autogenous grafts (P = .004). Defining the infection rate per graft rather than per revisional procedure, the ER group had a significantly higher graft infection rate at 11% (11/99) compared with 6.1% in the LR group (6/99; P = .012). The risk of infection for prosthetic grafts was significantly higher within the ER group at 27.3% (9/33) compared with autogenous grafts at 3.1% (2/66; P = .0001). Infection developed in three vein grafts and three prosthetic grafts in the LR group (P = NS). For prosthetic graft revisions only, infection risk was 27.3% (9/33) in the ER group and 6.5% (3/46) in the LR group (P = .005). The most common cultured pathogen was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ER, 6/11 vs LR, 3/6; P = NS). Within the ER group, the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly higher at 27.3% (3/11) compared with 0% (0/6) in the LR group (P = .04).",

    "abstract": "We have investigated whether popliteal artery volume flow (PAVF) measured immediately after balloon angioplasties of the superficial femoral artery-popliteal segments (SFA/POP) was predictive of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis.\nDuring the last 24 months, 203 patients (56% men) with a mean age of 73 +/- 9 years had 268 duplex-guided balloon angioplasties of the SFA/POP. Critical ischemia was the indication in 36%. Group I included 176 (66%) with stenoses, and group II had 92 (34%) with occlusions. All patients had completion duplex examinations that included three measurements of PAVF of below-the-knee popliteal artery.\nEarly (30 days) thrombosis of the treated femoropopliteal arterial segment developed in 10 patients (3.7%), three in group I (1.7%) and seven in group II (7.6%; P < .04). All 10 cases of early thrombosis were in patients with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) class C (6/185, 3.2%) and D (4/26, 15%) lesions. Moreover, the 19% incidence (n = 4) of early thrombosis in patients with PAVF <100 mL/min (mean, 73 +/- 24 mL/min; range, 20 to 99 mL/min) was higher compared with the 2.4% rate for patients with higher flows (mean, 176 +/- 60 mL/min; range, 100 to 450 mL/min; P < .01). At 6 months of follow-up, femoropopliteal occlusions had developed in nine more patients, and it became apparent that low PAVF measurements were still predictive of thrombosis (29%) when compared with higher PAVF cases (6%; P < .002). Log-rank comparison of survival curves for cumulative primary stenosis-free patency in group I and group II demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < .02). PAVF <100 mL/min and TASC classification were significant predictors of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis after femoropopliteal angioplasties. PAVF was the most powerful predictor of arterial thrombosis. The respective 6-month and 12-month limb salvage rates were 98% and 94% for patients with claudication and 88% and 85% for those with limb-threatening ischemia (P < .0001).\nOur results demonstrate that low PAVF is the most powerful predictor of early (30 days) and mid-term (6 months) arterial thrombosis after femoropopliteal interventions. In the presence of a low postprocedure PAVF (<100 mL/min), one may consider not reversing the heparin or using intermittent calf compression, or both, to augment the arterial flow.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether more \"modern\" complex wound dressings further improve the healing of venous ulcers over that with simple wound dressings, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of wound dressing trials that were published from October 1, 1997, through September 1, 2005.\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry Database to identify RCTs. Criteria for ultimate selection included treatment with compression and an objective outcome describing the proportion of wounds healed. Twenty RCTs were identified that satisfied these criteria and were classified into three wound dressing classes: semiocclusive/occlusive group (n = 8), growth factor group (n = 7), and human skin equivalent group (n = 5).\nAssessment of study design quality for the 20 RCTs showed a low percentage (<49%) of RCTs that incorporated at least 3 of 7 indicators of trial quality, but it seemed better in the 5 RCTs that showed significance for ulcer healing; 4 of the studies used at least 6 of the 7 characteristics of adequate study design. Five (25%) of the 20 RCTs had a statistically significantly improved proportion of ulcers healed in the experimental dressing group over control values: zinc oxide paste bandage (79% vs 56%) and Tegasorb (59% vs 15%) in the semiocclusive/occlusive group and perilesional injection of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (57% vs 19%) and porcine collagen derived from small-intestine submucosa (Oasis; 55% vs 34%) in the growth factor group. In the sole significant RCT from the human skin equivalent group, Apligraf (63%) was superior to Tegapore (48%). Four of these five studies also showed an improved time to complete healing by Kaplan-Meier estimate.\nCertain wound dressings can improve both the proportion of ulcers healed and the time to healing over that achieved with adequate compression and a simple wound dressing. The selection of a specific dressing, however, will depend on the dressing characteristics for ease of application, patient comfort, wound drainage absorption, and expense.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of acute limb-threatening ischemia from blunt traumatic tibial arterial disruption managed with endoluminal techniques. An otherwise healthy 37-year-old man involved in a motorcycle crash sustained a compound fracture of his right tibia and fibula. Arterial insufficiency developed after surgical reduction of the orthopedic injuries that warranted selective angiography of the involved extremity. This demonstrated complete occlusion of the infrageniculate circulation at the level of the ankle. Recanalization of the posterior tibial artery was achieved by using coronary balloon-expandable stents, thereby reestablishing in-line flow to the foot. Clinical and noninvasive surveillance at 2 years confirmed patency of the recanalized artery with the absence of any ischemic symptoms. Arterial reconstruction of the infrapopliteal arterial tree poses a formidable challenge in the setting of blunt trauma. Recent improvements in endovascular skills, endoluminal technology, and imaging capabilities have allowed percutaneous reconstruction of challenging arterial pathology. Endovascular treatment of blunt tibial injuries is an alternative to complex open reconstructions. These patients require close long-term postoperative surveillance because the durability of such a repair remains unknown.",

We report a novel case of successful endovascular treatment of acute cerebral malperfusion due to a dissection involving the aortic arch.\nA 66 year old man was transferred from another hospital with an acute type I aortic dissection and underwent emergent repair of the aortic valve and ascending aorta with a composite graft. Left hemiplegia and altered cognitive function were noted on postoperative day 1. A carotid duplex scan showed partial thrombosis of the right carotid artery with very slow flow and reversal of flow in the right vertebral artery. A head CT was normal, while a head MRI and MR angiogram showed intraluminal defects in the inominate and right carotid arteries and perfusion abnormality of the entire right middle cerebral artery territory, but only small infarcts of watershed areas. The patient underwent stenting of the right carotid and inominate arteries through the right carotid artery with complete resolution of a large pressure gradient that was noted prior to stenting. The patient's left hemiplegia and cognitive impairment subsequently resolved during his inpatient hospitalization. On follow up five months later, he had a normal neurologic exam and MRI showed old watershed infarcts but no perfusion abnormality. On most recent follow-up 2.5 years after treatment, he remains well and a CT angiogram shows that his stented vessels remain patent.\nEndovascular techniques may be safely applied to correct cerebral malperfusion that results from type I aortic dissection.",

The use of uPA as a thrombolytic agent in the treatment of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis is not suitable for all patients. This study aimed to determine whether thrombus resolution could be enhanced by upregulating uPA expression using adenoviral gene transfer as an alternative method of delivery.\nThe production of functional uPA by an adenoviral gene construct (ad.uPA) was confirmed by a colorimetric substrate assay and fibrin plate lysis. Thrombus was formed in the inferior vena cava of wild-type mice and injected, 48-hours after induction, with either a control virus at 10(8) plaque-forming units (pfu) or ad.uPA at 10(7) or 10(8) pfu. Thrombi were removed and weighed 7 days after treatment. Activity of metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 was measured by zymography and the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and D-dimer levels by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. The results were expressed as a mean +/- SEM. Values were standardized for wet weight or for soluble protein content (mg/sol protein).\nTreatment with ad.uPA reduced thrombus weight by twofold compared with thrombi treated by control virus (15.1 +/- 1.1 mg vs 7.4 +/- 1.3 mg, P = .004). Urokinase activity (17 +/- 3 pg/mg wet weight) was detected in all treated thrombi, but there was no dose-dependent effect. D-dimer activity was increased twofold after treatment with ad.uPA (1.7 +/- 0.15 ng/mg of sol protein vs 0.8 +/- 0.1 ng/mg of sol protein, P = .0015) and was associated with a reduction in thrombus size (P = .03). Urokinase overexpression did not affect the activity of MMP2, MMP9, or VEGF in the thrombus.\nIncreasing urokinase activity within the thrombus significantly enhanced natural thrombus resolution by a fibrinolytic action.

    "abstract": "Using endothelial cell/smooth muscle cell (SMC) cocultures, we have demonstrated that pressurized endothelial cell coculture inhibits SMC proliferation and promotes apoptosis, and that this effect is transferable through pressurized endothelial medium. We now hypothesized that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays a significant role in mediating these pressure-induced effects.\nConditioned media from endothelial cells and SMCs exposed to ambient and increased pressure were transferred to recipient SMCs. We counted cells after 5 days of incubation with these media and evaluated eNOS and inducible NOS (iNOS) levels by Western blot.\nConditioned media from pressurized endothelial cells significantly decreased recipient SMC counts. This effect was sustained when N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) was added to recipient cells but abolished when L-NAME was added to donor cells. SMCs were then exposed to control and pressurized conditions in monoculture or in coculture with endothelial cells. Pressure and coculture caused similar increase in iNOS levels but had no additive effect in combination. Finally, endothelial cells were exposed to control and pressurized environments. Pressure caused a 24% +/- 1.6% increase in eNOS protein (P = .04, n = 12). This effect was sustained when cells were treated with L-NAME (32% +/- 1.6% increase, P = .02) but abolished when endothelial cells were treated with calphostin C or PD98059 to block protein kinase C (PKC) or extracellular regulated kinase (ERK). Pressure also increased endothelial phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) by 1.8-fold to 2.6-fold compared with control conditions after exposure of 2, 4, and 6 hours (P = .02, n = 4). This increase was sustained after pretreatment with calphostin C.\nPressure modulates endothelial cell effects on SMC growth by increasing eNOS in an ERK-dependent and PKC-dependent manner.\nIntimal hyperplasia is the main cause for restenosis that complicates 10% to 30% of all such vascular procedures and 30% to 40% of endovascular procedures. This article provides some novel information about smooth muscle cell/endothelial cell interaction, one of the main regulators of vascular remodeling and intimal hyperplasia. The role of endothelial cell/smooth muscle cell interaction cannot be studied well in vivo because these interactions cannot be distinguished from other factors that coexist in vivo, such as flow dynamics, matrix proteins, inflammatory factors, and interactions with other cells in the vascular wall and in the bloodstream. In this work, we use pressure as a triggering stimulus to alter in vitro endothelial behavior and identify important changes in endothelial regulation of smooth muscle cell biology. The pathways involved in this process and discussed in this article could ultimately be used to manipulate endothelial cell/smooth muscle cell interaction in clinical disease.",

    "abstract": "Arterial cell and gene therapies are promising strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases; however, the optimal cell type and delivery technique for such treatment remain to be determined. The aim of the present study was to design a new approach for arterial cell and gene therapy in which genetically modified autologous skin fibroblasts are percutaneously delivered in stented rabbit femoral arteries in vivo.\nAutologous skin fibroblasts underwent in vitro transfection with the cationic lipid FuGene and plasmids expressing the human form of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (hTIMP-1) or nls-LacZ reporter genes.\nTransfection efficiency was about 50% and there were high levels of hTIMP-1 secretion up to 14 days after gene transfer. We demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo percutaneous transplantation of fluorescent fibroblasts in the rabbit femoral artery. Results were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. In vivo local delivery of hTIMP-1-expressing fibroblasts in stented femoral arteries also resulted in high-levels of hTIMP-1 secretion ex vivo for 7 days. Fibroblast transplantation resulted in a modest increase in intimal hyperplasia at the target site, which was reversed with hTIMP-1-transfected fibroblasts.\nPercutaneous transplantation of genetically modified autologous fibroblasts could be used as a cellular platform for locoregional secretion of therapeutic proteins to treat either specific arterial diseases or the diseased organ (eg, the heart) supplied by the target artery.\nCell and gene therapies are potential new treatments for cardiovascular diseases. We demonstrated that autologous fibroblasts could be easily harvested from a skin biopsy specimen, genetically modified in vitro with nonviral vectors, and percutaneously seeded in vivo in rabbit femoral arteries, leading to locoregional secretion of abundant amounts of recombinant proteins. This new approach has important advantages over alternative approaches that use endothelial cells, viral vectors, and intraoperative cell delivery. Clinical applications may include local treatment of atherosclerotic plaques or aneurysms and also treatment of the diseased organs supplied by the target artery (eg, ischemic or failing heart).",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in aortic aneurysm formation. Its activation requires formation of a trimolecular complex of MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), and membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, which is attached to the cell surface. At higher concentrations, TIMP-2 becomes an inhibitor of MMP-2. Thus, TIMP-2 could both augment and inhibit matrix degradation. This study was undertaken to define the net effect of TIMP-2 on matrix destruction and aneurysm formation.\nThe abdominal aortas of wild-type and TIMP-2-deficient (TIMP-2 -/-) mice were exposed to 0.25 mol/L CaCl2 or 0.9% NaCl for 15 minutes after laparotomy. Aortic diameters were measured before treatment and 6 weeks after aneurysm induction. In addition, aortic tissues were studied for MMP-2 activation by zymography, and matrix structure was studied by connective tissue staining.\nThe aortic diameter increased in both wild-type and TIMP-2-/- mice. The increase in the TIMP-2 -/- mice was significantly smaller after CaCl2 treatment (51% +/- 3%) compared with the diameter of wild-type mice (67% +/- 4%). Connective staining of aortic sections from the CaCl2-treated mice revealed disruption and fragmentation of the medial elastic lamellae in both wild-type and TIMP-2 -/- mice. Zymographic analysis showed that active MMP-2 levels were decreased in TIMP-2 -/- aortas compared with wild-type mice.\nTargeted deletion of TIMP-2 results in attenuation of aneurysm development. Despite its name as an inhibitor of MMPs, TIMP-2 promotes aortic enlargement in vivo, presumably through its role as a cofactor in the activation of MMP-2.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysmal (AAA) disease is a potentially fatal disorder that screening studies have detected in 2% to 9% of the general population. Medical therapy designed to inhibit the progression of small aneurysms includes control of hypertension and smoking cessation; neither of these measures is of proven benefit. Effective and directed medical treatments for small AAAs await elucidation of key etiologic factors. Understanding precisely which molecules mediate AAA development, and blocking the activity of these molecules, could lead to important new therapies. Through our research, we have found that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 has a role in this process in an experimental model of aortic aneurysms. We believe that TIMP-2 promotes aortic enlargement in vivo by activating matrix metalloproteinase 2.",

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. Recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. The aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, followed by cloning and sequencing.\nUniversal eubacterial primers were used to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. Subsequently, PCR amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in GenBank.\nSequences of Stenotrophomonas spp., including S. maltophilia (formerly Pseudomonas homology group V) were detected in six aneurysm samples. Propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and Brevundimonas diminuta (formerly P. diminuta) in four samples. Other species previously assigned to the Pseudomonas genus such as Comamonas testosteroni, Delftia acidovorans, Burkholderia cepacia, Herbaspirillum sp., and Acidovorax sp. were also detected. Some clones fell into other environmental species, including Methylobacterium sp. and Bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria that have not yet been cultivated. DNA sequences from oral bacteria, including Streptococcus sanguinis, Tannerella forsythia, and Leptotrichia buccalis were detected. Sequences from Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. Additional species included Dermacoccus spp. and Corynebacterium vitaeruminis.\nA wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development. Several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated.\nAlthough Chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. Overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. In the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. The presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at C.pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to investigate the occurrence of residual varicose veins (visible and ultrasonic) at the below-knee level after short-stripping the great saphenous vein (GSV) and to investigate the possible role of preoperative incompetent perforating veins (IPVs) on the persistence of these varicose veins.\nIn this prospective study in 59 consecutive patients (74 limbs) with untreated primary varicose veins, a preoperative clinical examination and preoperative color flow duplex imaging were performed. Re-evaluation (clinical examination and color flow duplex imaging) was performed 6 months after surgery. Dissection of the saphenofemoral junction and short-stripping of the GSV from the groin to just below the knee level was performed without additional stab avulsions on the lower leg. The association between postoperative reflux in the three GSV branches below the knee level and preoperative IPV and the association between postoperative visible varicose veins in the GSV below knee level and preoperative IPV were determined with odds ratios with the help of a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nPreoperative varicosities in the GSV below the knee were visible in 62 limbs (70%) and were visible after surgery in 12 limbs (16%). The number of limbs with reflux in the 3 below-knee GSV branches was as follows: anterior branch, 34 (49%) before surgery and 31 (44%) after surgery; main stem, 59 (79%) before surgery and 62 (91%) after surgery; and posterior branch, 49 (67%) before surgery and 46 (63%) after surgery. No statistically significant association between postoperative reflux in the three GSV branches and preoperative IPV nor between postoperative visible varicose veins and preoperative IPV was found.\nThis study shows that reflux in the GSV below knee level after the short-stripping procedure persists in all below-knee GSV branches. Approximately 20% of patients with visible varicose veins in the GSV area below the knee level will have visible varicose veins in this area 6 months after the short-strip procedure. These clinical and ultrasonic residual varicose veins are not significantly related to the presence of preoperative IPV.",

    "abstract": "Patients with tumors in the limbs who undergo surgical treatment may have involvement of major vessels. Major arteries are always reconstructed for limb salvage. Major veins may be reconstructed to avoid the onset of venous hypertension signs and symptoms. The objective of this study was to analyze the results from surgical treatment of a sample of patients who underwent lower limb venous reconstructions associated with the resection of malignant tumors.\nFollow-up was performed of 17 patients with malignant tumors involving major vessels in the lower limbs. The median length of follow-up was 22 months. Venous reconstruction concomitant to arterial reconstruction was performed in 15 patients, and an isolated venous reconstruction was performed in 2 patients. The venous substitutes used were the contralateral long saphenous vein (n = 12), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis (n = 3), and Dacron prosthesis (n = 2).\nVascular complications occurred in seven patients: three occlusions of the venous graft, edema in seven patients, and one rupture of the arterial graft. The primary 2- and 5-year patency rates of venous reconstructions were 79.3% and 79.3%, respectively. Nonvascular complications occurred in six patients: neurological deficit (n = 3), partial necrosis of the flap (n = 2), wound infection (n = 1), hematoma (n = 1), and enteric fistula (n = 1). Eight patients were still alive and disease free, although one of them underwent above-knee amputation as a result of local disease recurrence. One patient experienced regional disease recurrence and is undergoing chemotherapy. Eight patients died due to pulmonary metastases. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 58.6% and 42.4%, respectively. The 2- and 5-year thrombosis-free survival rates were 51.9% and 35.2%, respectively.\nLower limb venous reconstructions associated with tumor resection in this study gave good functional results, although the prognosis for these patients had been unfavorable.

Of these, 78 met the diagnostic criteria for RP (RP+). From April 2002 to March 2003, we were able to get follow-up information on 292 people (dropout rate, 1.4%). Eighteen subjects (6.1%) had died, and the remaining 274 were successfully contacted. They were first evaluated by a standardized phone interview regarding their cold sensitivity, digital color changes, and RP. If any significant medical changes related to RP and/or suggesting scleroderma were reported, these subjects were invited for a medical evaluation.\nMortality was similar in RP+ and RP- subjects, and no death was due to an RP-related condition. Seven cases of new RP were diagnosed in the RP- group, which corresponds to an annual incidence rate of 0.25%. Among the 72 RP+ subjects and the 7 subjects with a new RP available for follow-up, none developed clinical features of scleroderma. A disappearance of RP attacks for 2 winters or more was reported by 24 RP+ subjects (33%).\nThese results show that, in the general population, RP is most often a benign condition and may disappear in a substantial proportion of subjects.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine the effect of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) on the hemodynamic parameters and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) and examine the relation between preprocedural exhausted CVR and perioperative neurologic events.\nThe study included 29 patients with severe extracranial carotid stenosis undergoing CAS. Transcranial Doppler imaging was performed before the procedure, 2 days, and 2 to 4 months postoperatively. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, mean flow velocity, and pulsatility index of the ipsilateral MCA were recorded at rest. CVR was assessed with the breath holding test: the increase of mean flow velocity and the breath holding index were calculated.\nPeak systolic and mean flow velocities increased significantly in both postoperative studies compared to the preoperative values, end-diastolic velocity was significantly elevated only in the first study, and pulsatility index did not change significantly. When stimulated by breath holding, preoperative mean flow velocity did not increase significantly compared with the resting values; however, it did increase significantly during breath holding in both studies after CAS. The breath holding index improved significantly from -0.35 (-0.71 to 0.55) to 0.38 (0.12 to 0.61) at 2 days (P = .049) and 0.44 (0.31 to 0.92) at 2 to 4 months (P = .020). Exhausted CVR of the MCA preoperatively was associated with increased risk of neurological complications during or after the procedure (P = .006).\nCAS may improve the hemodynamic parameters and the vasomotor reactivity in the ipsilateral MCA. Exhausted CVR is associated with an increased risk of periprocedural neurologic complications.",

    "abstract": "With carotid artery stenting (CAS) becoming an ever-increasing procedure, we sought to determine risk factors for in-stent restenosis after CAS.\nConsecutive patients undergoing CAS between January 2002 and October 2004 at a tertiary care hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patient, filter, and stent selection were left to the discretion of the attending surgeon. High-risk patients were defined by significant comorbidities or a hostile neck (prior surgery or radiation, or both), and risk factor analysis was performed. In-stent restenosis was defined as >60%, and selective angiography was performed on patients with an in-stent restenosis >80% by duplex ultrasound imaging.\nReviewed were 101 patients (55 men, 46 women) who underwent 109 CAS procedures. Comorbidities were typical for patients with atherosclerosis. In addition, 38% (n = 41) of procedures were performed in patients who had prior neck surgery, of which 29% (n = 32) had previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy. Seventeen patients (16%) had a history of neck cancer, and all had prior neck radiation. Median follow-up was 5 months (range, 0 to 30 months). Neurologic complications included three transient ischemic attacks (2.8%) and one nondisabling stroke (0.9%). There were two myocardial infarctions (1.9%) and no periprocedural deaths (30 days), for a combined stroke, myocardial infarction, and death rate of 2.9%. Asymptomatic in-stent restenosis developed in 12 carotids (11%), five of which required endovascular intervention, with a mean of 6 months to restenosis. Univariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine risk factors for the development of restenosis. Prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, and prior neck cancer were all significant risk factors. When these significant risk factors from univariate analysis were put into multivariate analysis, however, the only marginally significant risk factor was prior neck cancer (P = .06). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a cumulative freedom from in-stent restenosis at 24 months of 88% +/- 6% in patients without neck cancer compared with 27% +/- 17% (P = .02) in patients with neck cancer.\nCAS has been shown to be safe and effective in high-risk patients, with minimal adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has the potential to detect unsuspected extravascular pathology in patients with vascular disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of unexpected findings, additional associated costs, and alterations in treatment in vascular patients undergoing CTA.\nDuring a recent 15-month period, 350 subjects (207 men, 143 women; mean age of 66 +/- 14 years) underwent CTA for evaluation of aortic aneurysms (43%), lower extremity occlusive disease (33%), renal artery disease (17%), or aortic graft infection (7%). Unexpected CTA findings were categorized as incidental, clinically important but probably benign, or possibly serious. Medical records were reviewed to determine the outcome of additional testing and to identify alterations in treatment plans.\nOf the 163 subjects (47%) with positive findings, 95 (27%) were categorized as incidental, 27 (8%) as probably benign, and 41 (12%) as potentially serious. Additional tests were required in 57 subjects (15%) to confirm these results. Seventeen (5%) of the 350 original subjects were ultimately considered to have life-threatening pathology found on CTA, but 11 of these were lost to follow-up. Significant alterations in treatment plan occurred in the six patients with life-threatening pathology and in one other patient with benign disease.\nThese data suggest that unexpected CTA findings are common in vascular patients. Although few prove to be serious, treatment delays associated with evaluation of benign lesions are modest. Of major concern, one fourth of patients with potentially serious lesions did not undergo further evaluation in this study. Vascular surgeons need to ensure adequate follow-up for their patients with potentially serious extravascular lesions.",

Intragroup differences between SBF and HBF were significant before and after angioplasty (P < .001).

Univariate and multivariable linear regressions were performed to determine RU predictors and outcomes.\nCompared with patients with rest pain, patients presenting with TL as the indication for bypass surgery had a longer index length of stay (mean, 9.8 vs 6.2 days), more rehospitalizations (mean, 1.6 vs 1.2), and a longer cumulative length of stay (mean, 27.7 vs 17.3 days; P < .0001 for all comparisons). Rehospitalizations over the ensuing year were for additional procedures (37.5%), wound infection (14.6%), graft failure (10.7%), and other cardiovascular (10%) and noncardiovascular (26%) reasons. Early GRE (stenosis > or =70%, thrombosis, revision, or major amputation within 30 days) occurred in 162 (11.5%) patients, resulting in a longer index length of stay (mean, 11.8 vs 8.6 days; P = .0002) and cumulative length of stay (mean, 25.9 vs 24.6 days; P = .0043), but no difference in the number of rehospitalizations (mean, 1.6 vs 1.5 days; P = .3272). During the 1-year follow-up, 554 (39.5%) patients had GREs, and this resulted in more rehospitalizations (mean, 2.1 vs 1.1; P < .0001) and a longer cumulative length of stay (mean, 28.2 vs 21.9 days; P < .0001) compared with patients without GRE. Multivariable analysis demonstrated the highly positive association of TL (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75) and early GRE (HR, 1.77) with the index length of stay, whereas comorbidities-namely, dialysis dependency (HR, 1.31), nonsmoking status (HR, 1.29), hypertension (HR, 1.26), and increasing age (HR, 1.01)-also had strong effects. The effect of TL and GRE on later RU (number of rehospitalizations and cumulative length of stay) was present but less pronounced than patient comorbidities (namely, dialysis).\nThe stage of disease at presentation (TL vs rest pain) and the patency of the bypass graft (freedom from GRE) are critical determinants of RU over the first year after limb-salvage surgery. These effects predominate early (index length of stay) and persist through 1 year. Patient-specific factors, particularly dialysis-dependent renal failure, are also critical comorbidities affecting RU in these patients.",

The results were included in a systematic review of studies evaluating the Hardman index.\nIn-hospital mortality after operation was 41% (67/162). There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between open repair (n = 106) and EVAR (n = 56), whereas the Hardman index was associated with operative mortality in our institution and in the systematic review of 970 patients (P < .001). Mortality rate in patients with Hardman index > or =3 was 77% in the pooled analysis. A full data set of all five scoring variables was obtained in 94 (58%) of 162 patients in our study, and potential underscoring was thus possible in 68 patients. Of the available ECGs, 12 (8.7%) of 138 were judged nondiagnostic. Five studies did not state their missing data on ECG and hemoglobin and serum creatinine concentrations, nor did they specify the criteria for ECG ischemia.\nA strong correlation between the Hardman index and mortality was found. A Hardman index > or =3 cannot be used as an absolute limit for denial of surgery. The utility of the Hardman index seems to be impeded by variability in scoring resulting from missing or nondiagnostic data.",

    "abstract": "Transrenal fixation of abdominal aortic endografts may provide a more secure proximal attachment with few deleterious effects with respect to renal function. This study's purpose was to determine whether different metals used in two commercially available endografts (Cook Zenith and Medtronic Talent) result in different effects on renal function when placed across renal ostia.\nA total of 140 consecutive patients, between August 2003 and April 2005, who underwent elective endovascular repair of an aortic aneurysm with a nitinol or stainless steel-based endograft with transrenal fixation were reviewed with a mean follow-up period of 5.5 months (range, 1-22 months). The main outcome variable was the percentage change in creatinine clearance (CrCl), which was determined before surgery and at the most recent follow-up. Multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze the contribution of various factors to any deterioration in renal function.\nThe 140 patients were predominantly male (86%), with a mean age of 75 years (range, 56-92) and a mean aneurysm diameter of 62 mm (range, 42-110 mm). The mean intraoperative contrast use was 67 mL (range, 45-160 mL), and after surgery these patients received a mean of 3 surveillance computed tomographic scans (range, 1-7). Nineteen cases (13.6%) required deliberate accessory renal artery coverage. CrCl did not change significantly after surgery; the mean change in CrCl at the end of follow-up was a 2.5% decrease. There was no difference in the reduction in CrCl between endograft types. Only 14.3% of patients experienced a greater than 20% decrease in CrCl. Multiple regression analysis failed to show a relationship between change in renal function and age, sex, aneurysm diameter, infrarenal neck dimensions, endograft type, coverage of accessory renal arteries, intraoperative contrast volume, preoperative CrCl, and postoperative computed tomographic scans. Length of follow-up was an independent predictor (P = .04).\nTransrenal endograft fixation results in little deterioration in renal function during intermediate follow-up. The few patients who do experience a decline in renal function do so independently of any features related to the initial endovascular repair, and there is no difference in renal deterioration between endografts with nitinol and stainless steel transrenal bare metal stents.",

    "abstract": "The appropriate size threshold for endovascular repair of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is unclear. We studied the outcome of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as a function of preoperative aneurysm diameter to determine the relationship between aneurysm size and long-term outcome of endovascular repair.\nWe reviewed the results of 923 patients treated in a prospective, multicenter clinical trial of EVAR. Small aneurysms were defined according to two size thresholds of 5.5 cm and 5.0 cm. Two-way analysis was used to compare patients with small aneurysms (<5.5 cm, n = 441) to patients with large aneurysms (> or =5.5 cm, n = 482). An ordered three-way analysis was used to compare patients with small AAA (<5.0 cm, n = 145), medium AAA (5.0 to 5.9 cm, n = 461), and large AAA (> or =6.0 cm, n = 317). The primary outcome measures of rupture, AAA-related death, surgical conversion, secondary intervention, and survival were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates at 5 years.\nMedian aneurysm size was 5.5 cm. The two-way comparison showed that 5 years after EVAR, patients with small aneurysms (<5.5 cm) had a lower AAA-related death rate (1% vs 6%, P = .006), a higher survival rate (69% vs 57%, P = .0002), and a lower secondary intervention rate (25% vs 32%, P = .03) than patients with large aneurysms (> or =5.5 cm). Three-way analysis revealed that patients with small AAAs (<5.0 cm) were younger (P < .0001) and were more likely to have a family history of aneurysm (P < .05), prior coronary intervention (P = .003), and peripheral occlusive disease (P = .008) than patients with larger AAAs. Patients with smaller AAAs also had more favorable aortic neck anatomy (P < .004). Patients with large AAAs were older (P < .0001), had higher operative risk (P = .01), and were more likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .005), obesity (P = .03), and congestive heart failure (P = .004). At 5 years, patients with small AAAs had better outcomes, with 100% freedom from rupture vs 97% for medium AAAs and 93% for large AAAs (P = .02), 99% freedom from AAA-related death vs 97% for medium AAAs and 92% for large AAAs (P = .02) and 98% freedom from conversion vs 92% for medium AAAs and 89% for large AAAs (P = .01). Survival was significantly improved in small (69%) and medium AAAs (68%) compared to large AAAs (51%, P < .0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed that aneurysm size was a significant independent predictor of rupture (P = .04; hazard ratio [HR], 2.195), AAA-related death (P = .03; HR, 2.007), surgical conversion (P = .007; HR, 1.827), and survival (P = .001; HR, 1.351). There were no significant differences in secondary intervention, endoleak, or migration rates between small, medium, and large AAAs.\nPreoperative aneurysm size is an important determinant of long-term outcome following endovascular repair. Patients with small AAAs (<5.0 cm) are more favorable candidates for EVAR and have the best long-term outcomes, with 99% freedom from AAA death at 5 years. Patients with large AAAs (> or =6.0 cm) have shorter life expectancy and have a higher risk of rupture, surgical conversion, and aneurysm-related death following EVAR compared to patients with smaller aneurysms. Nonetheless, 92% of patients with large AAAs are protected from AAA-related death at 5 years. Patients with AAAs of intermediate size (5 to 6 cm) represent most of the patients treated with EVAR and have a 97% freedom from AAA-related death at 5 years.",

The two-way comparison showed that 5 years after EVAR, patients with small aneurysms (<5.5 cm) had a lower AAA-related death rate (1% vs 6%, P = .006), a higher survival rate (69% vs 57%, P = .0002), and a lower secondary intervention rate (25% vs 32%, P = .03) than patients with large aneurysms (> or =5.5 cm). Three-way analysis revealed that patients with small AAAs (<5.0 cm) were younger (P < .0001) and were more likely to have a family history of aneurysm (P < .05), prior coronary intervention (P = .003), and peripheral occlusive disease (P = .008) than patients with larger AAAs. Patients with smaller AAAs also had more favorable aortic neck anatomy (P < .004). Patients with large AAAs were older (P < .0001), had higher operative risk (P = .01), and were more likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .005), obesity (P = .03), and congestive heart failure (P = .004). At 5 years, patients with small AAAs had better outcomes, with 100% freedom from rupture vs 97% for medium AAAs and 93% for large AAAs (P = .02), 99% freedom from AAA-related death vs 97% for medium AAAs and 92% for large AAAs (P = .02) and 98% freedom from conversion vs 92% for medium AAAs and 89% for large AAAs (P = .01). Survival was significantly improved in small (69%) and medium AAAs (68%) compared to large AAAs (51%, P < .0001).

    "abstract": "The feasibility of laparoscopic aortic surgery with robotic assistance has been sufficiently demonstrated. Reported is the clinical experience of robot-assisted aortoiliac reconstruction for occlusive disease and aneurysm performed using the da Vinci system.\nBetween November 2005 and June 2006, 30 robot-assisted laparoscopic aortoiliac procedures were performed. Twenty-seven patients were prospectively evaluated for occlusive disease, two patients for abdominal aortic aneurysm, and one for common iliac artery aneurysm. Dissections of the aorta and iliac arteries were performed laparoscopically using a transperitoneal direct approach technique, a modification of the St\u00e1dler method. The robotic system was used to construct anastomoses, to perform thromboendarterectomies and, in most of the cases, for posterior peritoneal suturing.\nRobot-assisted procedures were successfully performed in all patients. The robot was used to perform both the abdominal aortic and common iliac artery aneurysm anastomoses, the aortoiliac reconstruction with patch, and to complete the central, end-to-side anastomosis in another operation. Median operating time was 236 minutes (range, 180 to 360 minutes), with a median clamp time of 54 minutes (range, 40 to 120 minutes). Operative time is defined as the time elapsed from the initial incision to final skin closure. Median anastomosis time was 27 minutes (range, 20 to 60 minutes), and median blood loss was 320 mL (range, 100 to 1500 mL). No conversion was necessary, 30-day survival was 100%, median intensive care unit stay was 1.8 days, and median hospital stay was 5.3 days. A regular oral diet was resumed after a mean time of 2.5 days.\nRobot-assisted laparoscopic surgery is a feasible technique for aortoiliac surgery. The da Vinci robotic system facilitated the creation of the aortic anastomosis and shortened aortic clamp time in comparison with our laparoscopic techniques.",

    "abstract": "An easy-to-use vascular sealant with good safety and efficacy is needed to prevent anastomotic bleeding in vascular surgery. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cyanoacrylate surgical sealant in establishing hemostasis of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene to arterial vascular anastomoses in arteriovenous (AV) grafts and femoral bypass grafts.\nThis multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study was conducted in a hospital setting at 12 sites: 10 in the United States and 2 in Europe. A total of 151 patients undergoing femoral bypass procedures or AV shunt procedures for hemodialysis access using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were randomized 2:1 to receive cyanoacrylate surgical sealant or the control (oxidized cellulose) between April 26, 2004, and January 18, 2005. Randomization was stratified by clinical site and type of procedure. After the anastomosis, cyanoacrylate surgical sealant or the control was applied to all anastomosis sites for patients undergoing femoral bypass procedures and to only the arterial anastomosis sites for patients undergoing AV shunt procedures. The primary end point was the elapsed time from clamp release to hemostasis. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients achieving hemostasis at t = 0 (immediate), 1, 5, or 10 minutes after clamp release, use of additional adjunctive measures to achieve hemostasis, and occurrence of adverse events.\nBaseline demographics and clinical characteristics showed that the two treatment groups were similar at baseline. The mean time from clamp release to hemostasis was 119.3 seconds with cyanoacrylate surgical sealant vs 403.8 seconds with the control (P < .001). Immediate hemostasis was achieved in 54.5% of patients receiving cyanoacrylate surgical sealant and in 10% of those receiving the control. The proportion of patients requiring additional adjunctive measures was lower with cyanoacrylate surgical sealant, and the occurrence of adverse events was similar in both groups.\nThis study demonstrates that cyanoacrylate surgical sealant is effective at reducing the time to hemostasis and achieving immediate hemostasis in AV shunt and femoral bypass procedures and that it is safe for internal use. Cyanoacrylate surgical sealant is an easy-to-use vascular sealant with good safety and efficacy that significantly decreases anastomotic bleeding in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Current treatment modalities for chronic leg ulcers are time consuming, expensive, and only moderately successful. Recent data suggest that creating a subatmospheric pressure by vacuum-assisted closure (V.A.C., KCI Concepts, San Antonio, Texas) therapy supports the wound healing process.\nThe efficacy of vacuum-assisted closure in the treatment of chronic leg ulcers was prospectively studied in a randomized controlled trial in which 60 hospitalized patients with chronic leg ulcers were randomly assigned to either treatment by V.A.C. or therapy with conventional wound care techniques. The primary outcome measure was the time to complete healing (days). Statistical analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat basis.\nThe median time to complete healing was 29 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.5 to 32.5) in the V.A.C. group compared with 45 days (95% CI, 36.2 to 53.8) in the control group (P = .0001). Further, wound bed preparation during V.A.C. therapy was also significantly shorter at 7 days (95% CI 5.7 to 8.3) than during conventional wound care at 17 days (95% CI, 10 to 24, P = .005). The costs of conventional wound care were higher than those of V.A.C. Both groups showed a significant increase in quality of life at the end of therapy and a significant decrease in pain scores at the end of follow-up.\nV.A.C. therapy should be considered as the treatment of choice for chronic leg ulcers owing to its significant advantages in the time to complete healing and wound bed preparation time compared with conventional wound care. Particularly during the preparation stage, V.A.C. therapy appears to be superior to conventional wound care techniques.",

The procedures took place between January 1995 and December 2003. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained for all patients in 2004 to assess changes in CIA diameter. Measurements on preoperative and postoperative CT scans were all made at the same level using the same technique.\nEntered in the study were 147 patients (138 men, 9 women) with a mean age of 68 years. Mean follow-up from aortic surgery to verification of CIA diameter on the postoperative CT scan was 4.8 years. Mean preoperative CIA diameter was 13.6 mm vs 15.2 mm postoperatively. No patient developed occlusive iliac artery disease during follow-up. Three patients (2%) required repeat surgery during follow-up for a CIA aneurysm. The 147 patients were divided into three groups based on preoperative CIA diameter shown in CT scan: group A (n = 59, 40.1%), both CIA were of normal diameter; group B (n = 53, 36.1%), ectasia (diameter between 12 and 18 mm) of at least one CIA; group C (n = 35, 23.8%), an aneurysm (diameter >18 mm) of at least one CIA. CIA diameter increased by a mean of 1 mm (9.4%) over 5.5 years in group A vs 1.7 mm (12.1%) over 4.3 years in group B and 2.3 mm (12.7%) over 4.2 years in group C. The three patients who required repeat surgery for a CIA aneurysm during follow-up were all in group C. Four variables were associated with aneurysmal change in CIA: initial CIA diameter, celiac aorta diameter on the preoperative CT scan, a coexisting aneurysm site, and the follow-up duration.\nTube-graft placement during AAA surgery is justified even for moderate CIA dilatation (<18 mm). CIA aneurysms with a preoperative diameter > or =25 mm enlarge more rapidly and warrant insertion of a bifurcated graft during the same surgical session as AAA repair. The evolutive potential of CIA between 18 mm and 25 mm in diameter justifies a bifurcated graft when the celiac aorta diameter is >25 mm or the patient's life expectancy is > or =8 years.",

    "abstract": "Three main types of anesthesia are used for infrainguinal bypass: general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA), spinal anesthesia (SA), and epidural anesthesia (EA). We analyzed a large clinical database to determine whether the type of anesthesia had any effect on clinical outcomes in lower extremity bypass.\nThis study is an analysis of a prospectively collected database by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) of the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. All patients from 1995 to 2003 in the NSQIP database who underwent infrainguinal arterial bypass were identified via Current Procedural Terminology codes. The 30-day morbidity and mortality outcomes for various types of anesthesia were compared by using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression to control for confounders.\nThe NSQIP database identified 14,788 patients (GETA, 9757 patients; SA, 2848 patients; EA, 2183 patients) who underwent a lower extremity infrainguinal arterial bypass during the study period. Almost all patients (99%) were men, and the mean age was 65.8 years. The type of anesthesia significantly affected graft failure at 30 days. Compared with SA, the odds of graft failure were higher for GETA (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.77; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day graft failure between EA and SA. Regarding cardiac events, defined as postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest, patients with normal functional status (activities of daily living independence) and no history of congestive heart failure or stroke did worse with GETA than with SA (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.32-2.48; P < .0001). There was no statistically significant difference between EA and SA in the incidence of cardiac events. GETA, when compared with SA and EA, was associated with more cases of postoperative pneumonia (odds ratio: 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1-4.4; P = .034]. There was no significant difference between EA and SA with regard to postoperative pneumonia. Compared with SA, GETA was associated with an increased odds of returning to the operating room (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20-1.64; P < .001), as was EA (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31; P = .005). GETA was associated with a longer surgical length of stay on univariate analysis, but not after controlling for confounders. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality among the three groups with univariate or multivariate analyses.\nAlthough GETA is the most common type of anesthesia used in infrainguinal bypasses, our results suggest that it is not the best strategy, because it is associated with significantly worse morbidity than regional techniques.",

Almost all patients (99%) were men, and the mean age was 65.8 years. The type of anesthesia significantly affected graft failure at 30 days. Compared with SA, the odds of graft failure were higher for GETA (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.77; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day graft failure between EA and SA. Regarding cardiac events, defined as postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest, patients with normal functional status (activities of daily living independence) and no history of congestive heart failure or stroke did worse with GETA than with SA (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.32-2.48; P < .0001). There was no statistically significant difference between EA and SA in the incidence of cardiac events. GETA, when compared with SA and EA, was associated with more cases of postoperative pneumonia (odds ratio: 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1-4.4; P = .034]. There was no significant difference between EA and SA with regard to postoperative pneumonia. Compared with SA, GETA was associated with an increased odds of returning to the operating room (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20-1.64; P < .001), as was EA (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31; P = .005). GETA was associated with a longer surgical length of stay on univariate analysis, but not after controlling for confounders. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality among the three groups with univariate or multivariate analyses.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of infrapopliteal bypass when an adjuvant arteriovenous (AV) fistula was reconstructed as means of rescue as a result of poor runoff. The design was a retrospective multicenter case-control study.\nSeventy-seven infrapopliteal vein bypasses required an adjuvant AV fistula among 1813 patients operated on for critical leg ischemia in 3 vascular centers between 1996 and 2003. The mean age was 74 years (range, 39-90 years). A total of 70% of the patients had diabetes, and 24% had undergone previous vascular surgery. In 25% of the bypasses, the distal anastomosis was in a crural artery, in 55% it was in the dorsal pedal artery, and in 20% it was in a plantar artery. An adjuvant AV fistula was reconstructed in all cases because of poor intraoperative arterial status, intraoperative angiography, or low intraoperative flow. A control group was retrieved that matched the study group according to the recipient artery and runoff score.\nThe primary and secondary patency were 61% and 75%, respectively, at 1 year in the AV fistula group and 57% and 71% in the control group. The 3-year patency rates were 49% and 62% for the AV fistula group and 46% and 71% for the control group, respectively. There was a 76% leg-salvage rate at 3 years in the study group, compared with 87% in the control group. There were no major complications related to the AV fistula. Intraoperative flow was increased from a median of 20 mL/min to 115 mL/min by the AV fistula (P = .003). The graft flow was significantly higher in the AV fistula group than in the control group (P = .001).\nThe adjuvant AV fistula increased graft flow significantly in a poor-outflow venous bypass. In this extreme patient group, acceptable patency and leg salvage was achieved without adverse effects. Despite this, the AV fistula did not improve the outcome.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports from select hypertensive patients suggest that atherosclerotic renovascular disease (RVD) is rapidly progressive and associated with a decline in kidney size and kidney function. This prospective, population-based study estimates the incidence of new RVD and progression of established RVD among elderly, free-living participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).\nThe CHS is a multicenter, longitudinal cohort study of cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality among men and women aged >65 years old. From 1995 through 1996, 834 participants underwent renal duplex sonography (RDS) to define the presence or absence of significant RVD. Between 2002 and 2005, a second RDS study was performed in 119 participants (mean study interval, 8.0 +/- 0.8 years). Significant RVD was defined as hemodynamically significant stenosis (renal artery peak systolic velocity [RA-PSV] exceeding 1.8 m/s) or renal artery occlusion. Prevalent RVD was significant RVD at the first RDS, and incident disease was defined as new significant RVD at the second RDS. Significant change of RVD was defined as a change in RA-PSV of greater than two times the standard deviation of expected change over time, regardless of hemodynamic significance or progression to renal artery occlusion.\nThe second RDS study cohort included 119 CHS participants with 235 kidneys (35% men; mean age, 82.8 +/- 3.4). On follow-up, no prevalent RVD (n = 13 kidneys; 6.0%) progressed to occlusion. Twenty-nine kidneys without RVD at the first RDS demonstrated significant change in PSV at the second RDS; including nine kidneys with new significant RVD (8 new stenoses; 1 new occlusion). Controlling for within-subject correlation, the overall estimated change in RVD among all 235 kidneys was 14.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2% to 21.4%), with progression to significant RVD in 4.0% (95% CI, 1.9% to 8.2%). Longitudinal increase in diastolic blood pressure and decrease in renal length were significantly associated with progression to new (ie, incident) significant RVD but not prevalent RVD.\nThis is the first prospective, population-based estimate of incident RVD and progression of prevalent RVD among free-living elderly Americans. In contrast to previous reports among select hypertensive patients, CHS participants with a low rate of clinical hypertension demonstrated a significant change of RVD in only 14.0% of kidneys on follow-up of 8 years (annualized rate, 1.3% per year). Progression to significant RVD was observed in only 4.0% (annualized rate, 0.5% per year), and no prevalent RVD progressed to occlusion.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine whether the different inflation rates of intermittent pneumatic compression systems used in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis influence their hematologic and hemodynamic effects.\nA rapidly inflating intermittent calf compression system and a more gently inflating equivalent were applied to 20 healthy male volunteers for 2 hours each. Venous blood samples were taken for analysis of blood coagulation and fibrinolytic potential. Blood flow velocity was measured in the femoral vein with Doppler ultrasound.\nTissue factor pathway inhibitor significantly increased after the 2 hours of compression for both pumps (78.0 to 85.0 ng/mL rapid, P = .004; 76.5 to 78.0 ng/mL gentle, P = .5), as did plasminogen activator activity (0.85 to 1.05 IU/mL rapid, P = .006; 0.85 to 1.5 IU/mL gentle, P = 0.5). Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity was reduced, although only approaching significance for the gentle system (16.5 to 14.3 AU/mL, P = .06). A D-dimer test for global fibrinolysis showed significant increases for the gently inflating system (97 to 411 ng/mL P < .001) but not for the rapidly inflating system (276 to 350 ng/mL P = .9). The rapidly inflating system produced significantly higher venous peak velocities and augmentations as expected.\nAlthough the data confirm that both types of intermittent compression suppress procoagulant activation, rapid inflation clearly produced no extra benefit in increasing global fibrinolysis, and may be less hematologically effective.",

    "abstract": "Noncoronary atherosclerotic vascular disease, including symptomatic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD), promises to extract a steadily rising medical and economic toll over the coming decades. Although drug-eluting stents have led to substantial advances in the management of coronary atherosclerosis, endovascular treatment of noncoronary, peripheral arterial lesions continues to yield high restenosis rates and early clinical failures. In this report, we review recent developments in microfabrication and nanotechnology strategies that offer new opportunities for improving stent-based technology for the treatment of more extensive and complex lesions. In this regard, stents with microfabricated reservoirs for controlled temporal and spatial drug release have already been successfully applied to coronary lesions. Microfabricated needles to pierce lesions and deliver therapeutics deep within the vascular wall represent an additional microscale approach. At the nanoscale, investigators have primarily sought to alter the strut surface texture or coat the stent to enhance inductive or conductive schemes for endothelialization and host artery integration. Nanotechnology research that identifies promising strategies to limit restenosis through targeted drug delivery after angioplasty and stenting is also reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The Angio-Seal arterial closure device is widely used to prevent bleeding and facilitate early ambulation after arterial puncture. We had referred to us three female patients in whom this device had been used; its sponge had been unintentionally deployed in the arterial lumen. In a fourth female patient, a dissected plaque underneath the device occluded the femoral artery. Severe lower extremity ischemia occurred in each case. One intraluminal sponge was detected only after 20 days, when the patient had developed severe symptoms due to microembolization; in another patient, ischemia occurred 9 days after intraluminal deployment. In two, or possibly three, of the cases, the superficial femoral artery had been punctured. The device should not be used when the superficial femoral artery has been punctured, in which case complications are more likely to occur. Lower limb ischemia within several months after deployment of these devices should be investigated with duplex ultrasound scanning to examine the possibility that the ischemia may be caused by the device or by device-related thrombus. It is important to register the use of such devices in the procedural reports to make it possible to link their use to eventual later ischemic events.",

The size and the natural history pose unique challenges in the management of these lesions. We present one such case that was associated with a primary arteriovenous malformation in the splenic hilum. This is the third largest aneurysm reported in literature so far and the characteristic feature is that this is the first case of a hilar arteriovenous fistula complicated by formation of a giant aneurysm and another smaller aneurysm. In our opinion the hilar malformation was congenital in origin and responsible for the formation of the two aneurysms. We also present an up to date review of literature on this subject.",

    "abstract": "Currently available synthetic polymer vascular patches used in cardiovascular surgery have shown serious shortcomings, including thrombosis, calcification, infection, and lack of growth potential. These problems may be avoided by vascular patches tissue-engineered with autologous stem cells and biodegradable polymeric materials. The objective of this study was to develop a tissue-engineered vascular patch by using autologous bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) and a hybrid biodegradable polymer scaffold.\nHybrid biodegradable polymer scaffolds were fabricated from poly(lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) (PLCL) copolymer reinforced with poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) fibers. Canine bone marrow mononuclear cells were induced in vitro to differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Tissue-engineered vascular patches (15 mm wide x 30 mm long) were fabricated by seeding vascular cells onto PGA/PLCL scaffolds and implanted into the inferior vena cava of bone marrow donor dogs.\nCompared with PLCL scaffolds, PGA/PLCL scaffolds exhibited tensile mechanical properties more similar to those of dog inferior vena cava. Eight weeks after implantation of vascular patches tissue-engineered with BMCs and PGA/PLCL scaffolds, the vascular patches remained patent with no sign of thrombosis, stenosis, or dilatation. Histological, immunohistochemical, and scanning electron microscopic analyses of the retrieved vascular patches revealed regeneration of endothelium and smooth muscle, as well as the presence of collagen. Calcium deposition on tissue-engineered vascular patches was not significantly different from that on native blood vessels. Immunofluorescent double staining confirmed that implanted BMCs survived after implantation and contributed to regeneration of endothelium and vascular smooth muscle in the implanted vascular patches.\nThis study demonstrates that vascular patches can be tissue-engineered with autologous BMCs and hybrid biodegradable polymer scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) is identical to thymidine phosphorylase (TP), and it can induce angiogenesis, including arteriogenesis, in chronically ischemic canine myocardium. Because its effect on peripheral arterial disease has not been elucidated, we investigated whether overexpression of PD-ECGF/TP could ameliorate chronic limb ischemia in rabbits.\nLeft femoral arteries were resected from 24 male rabbits. After 10 days, a plasmid vector containing human PD-ECGF/TP complimentary DNA was injected into 10 sites in the adductor muscles. Control groups received either the LacZ plasmid vector or saline vehicle only (n = 8 per group). Blood pressure was measured in the calf before surgery, at the onset of ischemia, 10 days later, and 20 and 30 days after gene transfer. Collateral vessel development and limb perfusion were assessed by angiography, and resected tissues underwent molecular and histologic examination.\nIn the PD-ECGF/TP group, human PD-ECGF/TP messenger RNA and protein were still detected at 30 days after treatment. Calf blood pressure decreased significantly after femoral artery resection in all three groups. It subsequently showed a greater increase in the PD-ECGF/TP group than in either control group, and the difference was significant at 20 days after treatment (PD-ECGF/TP, 97.4 +/- 7.4; LacZ, 58.6 +/- 6.9; saline, 41.3 +/- 3.6). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated an increased ratio of capillaries and arterioles to muscle fibers in the PD-ECGF/TP group (2.14 +/- 0.13 and 1.51 +/- 0.06), but not in the LacZ group (1.39 +/- 0.04 and 0.71 +/- 0.05) or the saline group (1.34 +/- 0.05 and 0.71 +/- 0.04, P < .01). The angiographic score was higher in the PD-ECGF/TP group (0.96 +/- 0.08) than in the LacZ group (0.50 +/- 0.02) or saline group (0.51 +/- 0.03) at 30 days after gene transfer (P < .01).\nThis study demonstrated that PD-ECGF/TP gene transfer induced angiogenesis and decreased ischemia in a rabbit hindlimb model by promoting arteriogenesis, suggesting that targeting this gene may be a promising therapeutic strategy for peripheral vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has been widely described to play a critical role in aneurysm development. The goal of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal changes in MMP-9 expression and abundance in the early stages of aortic dilatation during the course of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) formation in a mouse model.\nIn this study, TAAs were surgically induced in a transgenic reporter mouse strain expressing the beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene under control of the MMP-9 promoter. Terminal studies were performed during the early stages of TAA development at 1 week (n = 6), 2 weeks (n = 6), and 4 weeks (n = 6) post-TAA induction surgery. Changes in aortic outer diameter were determined in vivo by video micrometry. MMP-9 transcriptional activity (beta-gal staining) and protein content (immunohistochemistry) were quantified at each time point and expressed as a percentage of unoperated reference control mice (n = 6).\nAortic dilatation was evident at 1 week and reached maximal size at 2 weeks (21% +/- 6% increase from baseline, P < .05). MMP-9 transcriptional activity was detected at 1 week post-TAA induction (722% +/- 323%, P = .19), reached a maximum within the adventitia at 2 weeks (1770% +/- 505%, P < .05), and returned to baseline by 4 weeks (167% +/- 47%, P = .21). MMP-9 transcription at 2 weeks colocalized with fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. MMP-9 protein content within the aortic adventitia was increased at 2 weeks post-TAA induction (413% +/- 124%, P < .05) and remained elevated at 4 weeks (222% +/- 41%, P < .05). MMP-9 staining was most intense at the adventitial-medial border and could be detected throughout the elastic media.\nThese findings demonstrate a unique spatiotemporal pattern of MMP-9 transcriptional activation and protein content in the developing TAA. Colocalization studies suggest that early dilatation may be driven in part by MMP-9 produced by endogenous cells residing within the aortic vascular wall.",

    "abstract": "The utility of intra-aneurysmal pressure determination is dependent on the ability to measure pressure in the presence of endoleak and thrombosis. In this study, the accuracy of a CardioMEMS wireless pressure sensor (CardioMEMS, Atlanta, Ga) transducer in the presence of thrombus associated with type II endoleak was measured.\nType II endoleaks were created in four mongrel dogs by implanting four collateral arterial side branches (lumbar and caudal mesenteric arteries) as a Carrel patch onto a 3-cm prosthetic polytetrafluoroethylene abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aneurysm was excluded 2 weeks later from antegrade perfusion by a stent graft. The wireless pressure sensor was positioned in the AAA external to the stent graft. A Konigsberg intraluminal solid-state strain-gauge pressure transducer (Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, Calif) that is accurate in the presence of thrombus served as the control to determine AAA pressure. Both of the transducers were implanted on the luminal surface of the aneurysm, 180 degrees opposite from the Carrel patch and endoleak channel. Intra-aneurysmal pressure resulting from the type II endoleak was measured twice daily for 4 weeks using both transducers. A total of 56 pre-exclusion and 224 post-exclusion distinct pressure determinations were made. Intra-aneurysmal pressure was indexed to the systemic pressure that was simultaneously measured by a strain-gauge pressure transducer implanted in the native aorta. Histologic analysis of the aneurysm contents was performed with hematoxylin and eosin.\nThe intra-aneurysmal systolic, mean, and pulse pressures produced by the type II endoleak were significantly lower than systemic pressure in all animals and were < 60% of systemic pressure (P < .001). Close correlation between the wireless transducer and the control strain-gauge transducer was observed (R = 0.83, P < .001). Arteriography and Doppler ultrasound documented retrograde flow through the aneurysm side branches and persistent endoleak patency up to the time of euthanasia. Pathologic analysis demonstrated the endoleak channel to be patent and separated from the transducers by thrombus, which surrounded both transducers.\nIntra-aneurysmal pressure generated by type II endoleaks may be accurately measured through thrombus using a wireless pressure sensor in the canine model. The wireless sensor has the potential for clinical applicability in diagnosing and characterizing type II endoleaks.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to verify the efficacy of external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein in the treatment of primary chronic venous insufficiency (PCVI).\nForty patients with PCVI of the bilateral lower extremities were enrolled at the time of surgical management. All 80 limbs were classified as CEAP C2 to C4, with moderate incompetence of the deep vein. The limbs of each patient were randomized into one of two groups according to the operative method, so that when one limb was randomized to group A, regardless of whether it was the right or left limb, the other limb was assigned to group B. In group A, external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein was combined with surgery of the superficial venous system; in group B, surgery of the superficial venous system alone was performed. The therapeutic effects between the limbs in groups A and B were compared by color duplex scanning, a color Doppler velocity profile, air plethysmography (APG), and a CEAP severity score at 1 month, 1 year, and 3 years postoperatively.\nWithin each group of limbs, no significant differences were found in the average operative time within each group of limbs. The varicose veins resolved, there were no deep vein thromboses, and the wounds healed well postoperatively in all cases. Leg heaviness was relieved completely in 90% of group A limbs (36/40) and 55% of group B limbs (22/40). Venous valve competence was achieved in 100%, 98.1%, and 90.9% of group A limbs at 1 month, 1 year, and 3 years postoperatively, respectively. The amount of venous reflux, APG indices, and CEAP severity scores were not significantly different between the two groups preoperatively (P > .05). The amount of venous reflux, reflux indices, CEAP severity scores, and muscle pumping indices improved markedly in group A limbs postoperatively compared with group B limbs (P < .01); muscle pumping indices did not improve significantly in group B limbs postoperatively (P > .05). There were significant differences in the amount of venous reflux, reflux indices, and CEAP severity scores between group A and B limbs at 1 month and 1 year postoperatively (P < .01). There were significant differences in all parameters assessed between group A and B limbs 3 years postoperatively (P < .05).\nExternal valvuloplasty of the femoral vein combined with surgical repair of the superficial venous system improved the hemodynamic status of the lower limbs, restored valvular function more effectively, and achieved better outcomes than surgical repair of the superficial venous system alone.",

    "abstract": "Primary varicose veins are commonly considered a progressive disease starting from the saphenous junctions and extending to tributaries in a retrograde fashion along the saphenous trunks. This theory has been criticized by studies indicating different patterns of development and progression of varicose veins. To contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, the anatomy of the venous bed was comparatively evaluated by duplex sonography in patients with varicose veins with a marked difference in age.\nThe study included 100 varicose limbs in 82 patients aged < 30 years and 238 limbs in 183 patients aged > 60 years. Veins were designated as saphenous veins (SVs), tributaries of the SVs (STVs), and veins not connected with the SVs (NSVs). Four main anatomic patterns were comparatively evaluated: (1) varicose changes only along SVs, (2) varicose changes along SVs and STVs, (3) varicose changes only in STVs, and (4) varicose changes only in NSVs.\nSVs were normal in 44% of varicose limbs. In most limbs from young subjects, varicose changes afflicted only SVTs (25%) and NSVs (36%). Varicose SVs were more frequent in the older group (62%) than in younger one (39%) owing to a higher prevalence of limbs with combined SV and STV varicosities (respectively, 59% and 37%). In the older group, varicosities in the STVs were more frequently observed in association with incompetence of the SV trunks.\nThe frequent occurrence of normal SVs in varicose limbs of all patients does not support the crucial role commonly credited to SVs in the pathogenesis of primary varicosities. Moreover, the SV trunks were normal in most varicose limbs from young patients. These findings suggest that varicose disease may progressively extend in an antegrade fashion, spreading from the STVs to the SVs. This hypothesis suggests that the saphenous trunks could be spared in the treatment of a relevant number of varicose legs. Prospective longitudinal studies with serial duplex evaluations of large series of extremities are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.",

Interposition of a prosthetic barrier (patch saphenoplasty) may be useful for this purpose; however, the incidence of postoperative complications after patch saphenoplasty is unknown. A prospective study examined the incidence of complications after patch saphenoplasty in primary and repeat varicose vein surgery.\nSilicone patch saphenoplasty was performed in a consecutive series of 462 limbs (primary GSV surgery in 380, repeat surgery in 82) in 387 patients. Early and late complications in the groin potentially related to patch saphenoplasty were registered at clinical follow-up after 1 week and at clinical and duplex ultrasound examination after 2 months, 1 year, and later in case of new symptoms.\nComplications occurred in 44 limbs (9.5%), 28 (7.4%) after primary GSV surgery and 16 (19.5%) after repeat surgery (P < .01). After repeat surgery, half of the complications were lymphatic problems. Nine limbs (2.0%) developed a complication after >2 months. Wound infection was registered in 13 limbs (2.8%), lymphocele or lymphedema in the groin or thigh in 15 limbs (3.2%), symptomatic or asymptomatic proximal venous thromboembolism in 14 limbs (3.0%), and swelling of the thigh due to important stenosis of the common femoral vein visible on duplex scan in 4 limbs (0.9%). Two of the latter remained symptomatic even after venoplasty and stenting of the pinpoint stenosis of the common femoral vein.\nPatch saphenoplasty can cause early and late postoperative complications in the groin, which are usually minor. In exceptional cases, major complications may cause important morbidity and may be difficult to handle.",

    "abstract": "Varicose vein recurrence after surgery occurs in up to 60% of patients. A variety of technical factors have been implicated, but biological factors such as neovascularization have more recently been proposed. The objective of this study was to characterize the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to recurrence in a large prospective series of recurrent varicose veins.\nDuplex and operative findings were recorded prospectively in a consecutive series of 500 limbs undergoing surgery for recurrent varicose veins between 1995 and 2005 in a university teaching hospital. Only limbs with previous saphenofemoral junction surgery were included. All limbs had preoperative duplex mapping by an accredited vascular technician who assessed the status of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in the thigh and groin, sought sonographic evidence of neovascularization, and reported on the presence of reflux in the short saphenous vein and perforator sites (typical and atypical). All operations were performed with an attending vascular surgeon as the lead operator.\nPrimary GSV surgery was incomplete in 83.2% of limbs. A completely intact GSV system was present in 17.4% of limbs. An incompetent thigh saphenous vein was present in 44.2% of limbs, 37.6% had GSV stump incompetence with one or more intact tributaries, and 16% had both a residual thigh GSV and an incompetent stump with intact tributaries. Non-GSV sites of reflux were identified in 25% of limbs. Neovascularization was identified on duplex scanning in 41 (8.2%) limbs. However, in 27 of these, surgical exploration revealed a residual GSV stump with 1 or more significant tributaries. Each of the remaining 14 (2.8%) limbs had a residual incompetent thigh GSV.\nDespite reports to the contrary, neovascularization occurs in a relatively small proportion of patients with recurrent varicose veins. All recurrent varicose veins associated with duplex-diagnosed neovascularization are also associated with persistent reflux in the GSV stump tributaries, thigh GSV, or both. Recurrence after primary varicose vein surgery is associated with inadequate primary surgery or progression of disease, and neovascularization alone is not a cause of recurrent varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "This study used intraoperative monitoring of the access flow to evaluate the results of flow reduction in the management of high-flow arteriovenous access-related symptoms of distal ischemia and cardiac insufficiency.\nA retrospective study was conducted of 95 patients (78 with ischemia, 17 with cardiac failure) who underwent flow reduction between 1999 and 2005. A preoperatively measured access flow-volume rate > 800 mL/min for autogenous accesses (n = 77) and > 1200 mL/min for prosthetic accesses (n = 18) was the selection criterion for the use of a flow reduction procedure. Flow reduction was achieved using a spindle-like narrowing suture near the anastomosis and final placement of a polytetrafluoroethylene strip while a flow meter was used for intraoperatively measuring the access flow. The desired postoperative flow was 400 mL/min for autogenous and 600 mL/min for prosthetic accesses.\nThe mean preoperative access flow was 1469 +/- 633 mL/min in patients with ischemia and 2084 +/- 463 mL/min in patients with cardiac failure, without significant differences between access types. The flow was reduced to 499 +/- 175 mL/min for autogenous accesses and to 676 +/- 47 mL/min for prosthetic accesses. The mean follow-up was 25 months (range, 1 to 73 months). Complete long-term relief of symptoms was observed in 86% of patients with ischemia and in 96% of patients with cardiac failure. Reconstruction significantly increased the digital-brachial index (0.41 +/- 0.12 vs 0.74 +/- 0.11; P < .05) and mean distal arterial pressure (47 +/- 17 mm Hg vs 79 +/- 21 mm Hg; P < .05) in patients with ischemia. Primary patency rates were significantly better for reconstructed autogenous accesses compared with rates of prosthetic accesses (91% +/- 4% vs 58% +/- 12% at 12 months; 81% +/- 6% vs 41% +/- 14% at 36 months; P < .001). The low patency of reconstructed prosthetic accesses is due to the high thrombosis risk of accesses that have a flow < 700 mL/min.\nFlow reduction using intraoperative access flow monitoring is an effective and durable technique allowing for the correction of distal ischemia and cardiac insufficiency in patients with a high-flow autogenous access. The desired postoperative access flow of 400 mL/min is not associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Flow reduction of prosthetic access is as effective; however, a higher access flow than the desired 600 mL/min seems to be necessary to achieve an acceptable patency in prosthetic accesses.",

    "abstract": "Several lumbar disc prostheses are being developed with the goal of preserving mobility in patients with degenerative disc disease. The disadvantage of lumbar artificial disc replacement (ADR) compared with anterior interbody fusion (ALIF) is the increased potential for displacement or component failure. Revision or removal of the device is complicated by adherence of the aorta, iliac vessels, and the ureter to the operative site. Because of these risks of anterior lumbar procedures, vascular surgeons usually provide access to the spine. We report our experience with secondary exposure of the lumbar spine for revision or explantation of the Charit\u00e9 disc prosthesis.\nBetween January 2001 and May 2006, 19 patients with prior implantation of Charit\u00e9 Artificial Discs required 21 operations for repositioning or removal of the device. Two patients had staged removal of prostheses at two levels. One patient had simultaneous explantation at two levels. The mean age was 49 years (range, 31 to 69 years; 56% men, 42% women). The initial ADR was performed at our institution in 14 patients (74%). The mean time from implantation to reoperation was 7 months (range, 9 days to 4 years). The levels of failure were L3-4 in one, L4-5 in nine, and L5-S1 in 12.\nThe ADR was successfully removed or revised in all patients that underwent reoperation. Three of the 12 procedures at L5-S1 were performed through the same retroperitoneal approach as the initial access. One of these three, performed after a 3-week interval, was converted to a transperitoneal approach because of adhesions. The rest of the L5-S1 prostheses were exposed from a contralateral retroperitoneal approach. Four of the L4-5 prostheses were accessed from the original approach and five from a lateral, transpsoas exposure (four left, one right). The only explantation at L3-4 was from a left lateral transpsoas approach. Nineteen of the 22 ADR were converted to ALIF. Two revisions at L5-S1 involved replacement of the entire prosthesis. One revision at L4-5 required only repositioning of an endplate. Access-related complications included, in one patient each, iliac vein injury, temporary retrograde ejaculation, small-bowel obstruction requiring lysis, and symptomatic, large retroperitoneal lymphocele. There were no permanent neurologic deficits, deep vein thromboses, or deaths.\nOwing to vascular and ureteral fixation, anterior exposure of the lumbar spine for revision or explantation of the Charit\u00e9 disc replacement should be performed through an alternative approach unless the procedure is performed < or = 2 weeks of the index procedure. The L5-S1 level can be accessed through the contralateral retroperitoneum. Reoperation at L3-4 and L4-5 usually requires explantation and fusion that is best accomplished by way of a lateral transpsoas exposure.",

    "abstract": "Reduced lower limb blood flow and resistive hemodynamic conditions potentially promote aortic inflammation and aneurysmal degeneration. We used abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computational flow modeling to determine the relationship between reduced infrarenal aortic blood flow in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) subjects and risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease.\nAortic diameter in consecutive SCI subjects (n = 123) was determined via transabdominal ultrasonography. Aortic anatomic and physiologic data were acquired via magnetic resonance angiography (MRA; n = 5) and cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance flow imaging (n = 4) from SCI subjects whose aortic diameter was less than 3.0 cm by ultrasonography. Computational flow models were constructed from magnetic resonance data sets. Results were compared with those obtained from ambulatory control subjects (ultrasonography, n = 129; MRA/phase-contrast magnetic resonance flow imaging, n = 6) who were recruited at random from a larger pool of risk factor-matched individuals without known AAA disease.\nAge, sex distribution, and smoking histories were comparable between the SCI and control groups. In the SCI group, time since injury averaged 26 +/- 13 years (mean +/- SD). Aortic diameter was larger (P < .01), and the prevalence of large (> or = 2.5 cm; P < .01) or aneurysmal (> or = 3.0 cm; P < .05) aortas was greater in SCI subjects. Paradoxically, common iliac artery diameters were reduced in SCI subjects (< 1.0 cm; 48% SCI vs 26% control; P < .0001). Focal preaneurysmal enlargement was noted in four of five SCI subjects by MRA. Flow modeling revealed normal flow volume, biphasic and reduced oscillatory flow, slower pressure decay, and reduced wall shear stress in the SCI infrarenal aorta.\nCharacteristic aortoiliac hemodynamic and morphologic adaptations occur in response to chronic SCI. Slower aortic pressure decay and reduced wall shear stress after SCI may contribute to mural degeneration, enlargement, and an increased prevalence of AAA disease.",

Aortic diameter was larger (P < .01), and the prevalence of large (> or = 2.5 cm; P < .01) or aneurysmal (> or = 3.0 cm; P < .05) aortas was greater in SCI subjects. Paradoxically, common iliac artery diameters were reduced in SCI subjects (< 1.0 cm; 48% SCI vs 26% control; P < .0001). Focal preaneurysmal enlargement was noted in four of five SCI subjects by MRA. Flow modeling revealed normal flow volume, biphasic and reduced oscillatory flow, slower pressure decay, and reduced wall shear stress in the SCI infrarenal aorta.",

    "abstract": "Restenosis after angioplasty is essentially due to intimal hyperplasia. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have experimentally been shown to have antiproliferative effects in addition to their antithrombotic properties. Their potential in reducing restenosis remains to be established. Therefore, we wanted to test the hypothesis that LMWH plus aspirin is more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of restenosis/reocclusion in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of femoropopliteal arteries. Further, different effects of LMWH in patients treated for critical limb ischemia (CLI) or claudication only should be investigated.\nAfter successful PTA, 275 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (claudication or critical limb ischemia) and femoropopliteal obstructions were randomized to receive either 2500 IU of dalteparin subcutaneously for 3 months plus 100 mg of aspirin daily (n = 137), or 100 mg aspirin daily alone (n = 138). The primary end point was restenosis or reocclusion documented by duplex ultrasonography imaging at 12 months.\nRestenosis/reocclusion occurred in 58 patients (44%) in the dalteparin group and in 62 patients (50%) in the control group (P = .30). In a subgroup analysis according to the severity of peripheral arterial disease, we found that in patients treated for claudication, restenosis/reocclusion developed in 43 (43%) in the dalteparin group, and in 35 (41%) in the control group (P = .70); in patients treated for CLI, restenosis/reocclusion was significantly lower in the dalteparin group (15, 45%) than in the control group (27, 72%; P = .01). No major bleeding events occurred in either group.\nTreatment with 2500 IU dalteparin subcutaneously given for 3 months after femoropopliteal PTA failed to reduce restenosis/reocclusion at 12 months. However, dalteparin may be beneficial in the subgroup of patients with CLI at 12 months follow-up.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the hypothesis that superficial femoral artery (SFA) subintimal angioplasty (SI-PTA) can maintain limb salvage with minimal complications in patients with symptomatic occlusive arterial disease.\nFrom March 1, 2004, until April 28, 2006, 78 patients with rest pain (62.2%), gangrene (25.6%), or severe progressive claudication (12.2%) were treated consecutively with 82 SFA SI-PTAs (4 bilateral). The mean age was 59 +/- 1.2 years, and 21 (27%) of the patients were female. All patients were treated in the operating room under local anesthesia by using fluoroscopic guidance, and the percentage SFA that was occluded was measured during the diagnostic portion of the procedure. Selective stent placement was performed after successful recanalization of the occluded arterial segments. Patients were treated with chronic aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate for 3 months and followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months with physical examination and arterial duplex scan.\nOf the 82 SFA SI-PTA attempts, 76 (92%) were initially successful, with an increase in the ankle-brachial index from 0.46 +/- 0.02 to 0.88 +/- 0.01 (P < .001). Five of the six patients with a failed SFA SI-PTA were female, two of the six had had previous bypass attempts, and one of the six had had a previous SFA SI-PTA attempt by another physician. Forty-nine (64%) of the 76 initially successful SFA SI-PTAs required placement of a stent, and 43 (56.5%) of the successful 76 SFA SI-PTAs required additional PTA of 1 or more arterial segments. The group treated with a successful SFA SI-PTA had 42.5% +/- 3.5% SFA occlusion, compared with 82% +/- 10% (P < .05) in the group with a failed attempt at SFA SI-PTA. Two of the six patients with initial SI-PTA failure underwent leg amputation within 30 days, three were treated with successful leg bypass surgery, and one was lost to follow-up. Of the 76 successful SFA SI-PTAs, 5 (6.5%) failed within 90 days, and the patients were treated successfully with leg bypass surgery. Of the 71 limbs with patent SI-PTAs at 90 days, 68 have remained patent with a mean follow-up 10.4 +/- 0.7 months (range, 2-24 months). Three of the 71 SFA SI-PTAs failed between 4 and 7 months (mean, 5 +/- 0.7 months): 1 patient was treated with successful bypass surgery, 1 patient is currently considering further intervention, and 1 patient was treated with amputation. Ten (14%) of the 71 successful SFA SI-PTAs required limited PTA for asymptomatic restenosis, as identified by the arterial duplex scan (7.4 +/- 1.4 months; range, 2-16 months). There were no perioperative deaths, and three patients have died during follow-up with patent SFA SI-PTAs (9.3 +/- 1.4 months).\nThese data suggest that SFA SI-PTA can be successfully used for limb salvage with minimal morbidity and mortality in a group of patients with severe lower extremity occlusive vascular disease.",

Electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreflex system has been shown to produce significant chronic blood pressure decreases in animals. The phase II Rheos Feasibility Trial was performed to assess the response of patients with multidrug-resistant hypertension to such stimulation.\nThe system consists of an implantable pulse generator with bilateral perivascular carotid sinus leads. Implantation is performed bilaterally with patients under narcotic anesthesia (to preserve the reflex for assessment of optimal lead placement). Dose-response testing at 0 to 6 V is assessed before discharge and at monthly intervals thereafter; the device is activated after 1 month's recovery time. This was a Food and Drug Administration-monitored phase II trial performed at five centers in the United States.\nTen patients with resistant hypertension (taking a median of six antihypertensive medications) underwent implantation. All 10 were successful, with no significant morbidity. The mean procedure time was 198 minutes. There were no adverse events attributable to the device. Predischarge dose-response testing revealed consistent (r = .88) reductions in systolic blood pressure of 41 mm Hg (mean fall is from 180-139 mm Hg), with a peak response at 4.8 V (P < .001) and without significant bradycardia or bothersome symptoms.\nA surgically implantable device for electrical stimulation of the carotid baroreflex system can be placed safely and produces a significant acute decrease in blood pressure without significant side effects.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and infection have been implicated in the pathogenesis of carotid artery atherosclerosis, but their role in cerebrovascular disease symptomatology is not so well defined. We hypothesized that carotid disease symptomatology was associated with specific serologic markers of inflammation and Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and the presence of the pathogen and concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the atheroma.\nIn 2004, 78 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy in our department, 46 of whom were symptomatic (group A) and 32 were asymptomatic (group B). A detailed medical history, the presence of atherosclerosis risk factors, ankle-brachial index and boxy mass index were recorded. We measured preoperatively the levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, TNF-alpha, and the titers of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG antibodies against C pneumoniae in the serum. Finally, the atherosclerotic plaques of all patients were immunohistochemically examined for the presence of C pneumoniae and their TNF-alpha concentration was determined.\nIsolation of the pathogen on the atheromatous lesion was statistically correlated with several risk factors and some of the variables that were tested. After testing independence of association, using the multiple regression analysis, only male gender (P = .024), hypertension (P = .008), hypercholesterolemia (P = .001), and TNF-alpha plaque values (P = .008) remained significantly associated. Hypertension, serum levels of fibrinogen and anti-C pneumoniae immunoglobulin A, detection of C. pneumoniae on the plaque, and plaque TNF-alpha values were significantly correlated with carotid disease symptomatology. After multiple analyses, only the presence of the pathogen on the lesion (P = .008) and atheroma TNF-alpha levels (P = .025) remained significantly associated with cerebrovascular events.\nIt seems that hypertensive hypercholesterolemic men are more likely to have C. pneumoniae infected carotid plaques and that these plaques have higher TNF-alpha concentrations. Cerebrovascular disease symptomatology is strongly correlated with both C. pneumoniae infection and TNF-alpha concentration of the atheroma.",

    "abstract": "Pivotal and comparative trial data are emerging for stent graft (SG) vs open repair of the thoracic aorta. We reviewed procedure-related perioperative morbidity, mortality, and mid-term outcomes in a contemporary series of patients treated with SG of the thoracic aorta. The data were compared with those of a patient cohort concurrently treated with open surgical repair confined to the descending aorta.\nA review of patients undergoing SG procedures and open surgery of the thoracic aorta from January 1, 1996, to November 30, 2005, was performed from a prospectively compiled database. Study end points included perioperative complications, late survival, freedom from reinterventions, and graft-related complications. Multivariate methods were used to assess variables potentially associated with study end points; late outcomes were compared with actuarial methods.\nIn 105 patients (mean age, 70 years; 66 male [62.9%]) SG repairs were done for 68 degenerative aneurysms (64.7%), 12 penetrating ulcers (11.4%), 15 pseudoaneurysms (14.3%), 9 traumatic tears (8.6%), and 1 acute dissection (0.9%). Mean follow-up was 22 months (range, 0 to 101 months). Eighty-nine (84.8%) SG patients were asymptomatic at presentation and underwent elective repair, whereas 16 (15.2%) presented with acute conditions and underwent urgent repair. Perioperative mortality was 7.6% (8/105), and actuarial survival at 48 months was 54% +/- 7%. The perioperative mortality rate among SG patients treated for degenerative pathology was 10.4% (8/77). Seven (6.7%) of 105 patients experienced spinal cord ischemic complications, including 2 patients with transient paraparesis that resolved by the time of discharge. Reinterventions were performed in 10.5% of patients (11/105), with freedom from reintervention approaching 81% by 48 months. Over the same interval, 93 patients were treated with open-surgical repair for descending thoracic aneurysm (anastomosis cephalad to the celiac axis). Perioperative mortality in the open cohort was 15.1% (14/93; P = .09 vs SG repair), and the 48-month actuarial survival was 64% +/- 6%. The incidence of spinal cord ischemic complications was 8.6% (8/93), including 4 patients with transient paraparesis (P = .44 vs SG repair). Nine patients (9.7%) required surgical reintervention during the follow-up period, with 48-month freedom from reintervention approaching 79% (P = .73 vs SG repair).\nOperative mortality was halved with SG, with similar late survival for both cohorts. Reinterventions were required at a nearly identical rate for open repair and SG, and both groups experienced similar rates of spinal cord ischemic complications.",

Seven (6.7%) of 105 patients experienced spinal cord ischemic complications, including 2 patients with transient paraparesis that resolved by the time of discharge. Reinterventions were performed in 10.5% of patients (11/105), with freedom from reintervention approaching 81% by 48 months. Over the same interval, 93 patients were treated with open-surgical repair for descending thoracic aneurysm (anastomosis cephalad to the celiac axis).

Patient demographics, procedural details, postoperative follow-up data, and SF-36 scores were compared between groups.\nBoth groups had total SF-36 scores that were significantly lower than preoperative scores at 1 week and 1 month after surgery but were not significantly different from the preoperative scores at 6 months (OR 66.2 +/- 21.1 to 72.3 +/- 19.8, P > .1; and EVAR 61.0 +/- 17.7 to 58.7 +/- 19.4, P > .1). Six-month total SF-36 scores were significantly higher in the OR group compared with the EVAR group (mean 72.3 +/- 19.8 OR vs 58.7 +/- 19.4 EVAR; P = .009). In the postoperative period, a significant drop occurred in mean scores in six of the eight domains of the SF-36 in the OR patients (physical function, PF; role physical, RP; bodily pain, BP; vitality, VT; social function, SF; role emotional, RE) and five domains for EVAR patients (PF, RP, BP, SF, RE). In two domains, RE and PF, scores returned to baseline values significantly sooner in EVAR patients than in OR patients (RE, EVAR 1 month vs OR 6 months; and PF, EVAR 1 month vs OR 6 months). In the VT domain, no significant postoperative drop occurred in the EVAR group, but in the OR group, mean scores were significantly lower at 1 week and 1 month compared with preoperative values. In the domains of general health and mental health, no significant drop occurred in SF-36 score postoperatively in either group.\nPatient reported health-related quality of life after infrarenal AAA repair is significantly impaired in the early postoperative period but returns to baseline by 6 months in patients treated with EVAR and OR. Patients having EVAR had significantly more rapid return to preoperative scores in selected domains of the SF-36. Even though EVAR is associated with shorter and less invasive perioperative hospital course and fewer postoperative complications, EVAR patients had lower quality of life scores 6 months after surgery than OR patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complicated by the potential for stent graft migration over time. Factors including the type of fixation, initial proximal fixation length, and dilation and elongation of the infrarenal aortic neck may contribute to device migration. We sought to determine when device migration is a real phenomenon with actual device movement that compromises aneurysm exclusion.\nComputed tomographic (CT) scans and computer reconstructions of all patients undergoing endovascular AAA repair with a passive fixation device at our institution from June 1996 to October 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. The distance from the distal renal artery to the proximal end of the stent graft at the time of initial deployment was determined for each patient. Migration was defined as a distance increase greater than 5 mm in the follow-up period; proximal fixation length, aortic neck enlargement and elongation, and neck angle were then measured. Data were further analyzed with respect to AAA growth, development of endoleak, AAA rupture, and the need for reintervention.\nA total of 308 patients with endovascular AAA repairs using a passive fixation device had complete postoperative imaging data sets; 48 patients (15.6%) with stent graft migration of 5 mm or more were identified, and 25 (8.1%) of these had a migration of 10 mm or more. Seventeen (35.4%) of 48 migration patients had a total loss of the proximal seal zone (loss patients); their average migration distance was 17.7 +/- 12.0 mm, with a mean neck shortening of 13.6 +/- 14.2 mm, and the average proximal fixation length loss was 14.0 +/- 7.6 mm. Those 31 patients with an intact proximal seal zone (nonloss patients) showed an average migration of 9.4 +/- 3.7 mm, with a mean neck lengthening of 9.6 +/- 8.4 mm and an average proximal fixation length change of 0.7 +/- 8.0 mm. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences between the loss and nonloss patients in follow-up duration (65.9 +/- 20.4 months vs 45.9 +/- 26.4 months; P = .01), neck dilatation at the distal renal artery (4.6 +/- 4.5 mm vs 1.8 +/- 1.9 mm; P = .026), stent graft migration distance (17.7 +/- 12.0 mm vs 9.4 +/- 3.7 mm; P = .001), change in aortic neck length (-13.6 +/- 14.2 mm vs 9.6 +/- 8.4 mm; P < .0001), change in proximal fixation length (-14.0 +/- 7.6 mm vs 0.7 +/- 8.0 mm; P < .0001), change in AAA size (1.8 +/- 7.1 mm vs -3.6 +/- 9.7 mm; P = .033), and use of a stiff body stent graft (47.1% vs 19.4%; P = .043). However, only change in aortic neck length was statistically significant on multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.591-0.961; P = .022). There were no differences between the loss and nonloss patients in time to migration discovery, initial AAA size, initial aortic neck diameter or length, initial device oversizing, initial neck angle, neck angle increase, type II endoleak, or AAA rupture. Eight of the 17 loss patients have been treated with proximal aortic cuffs; the remainder have refused reintervention, died of unrelated causes, or elected to have open repair.\nPostoperative elongation of the infrarenal aortic neck may create the radiographic perception of migration without necessarily causing a loss of proximal stent graft fixation. Patients with a total loss of the proximal seal zone actually have infrarenal aortic neck shortening, with a degree of neck dilatation beyond initial device oversizing that may compromise proximal fixation length. Conversely, those with an intact proximal seal zone demonstrate aortic neck elongation equivalent to migration, with no loss of proximal fixation length; these patients have a benign natural history without intervention. Thus, aortic neck dilatation beyond oversizing, aortic neck shortening, and loss of proximal fixation length are more clinically relevant predictors of proximal stent graft failure than simple migration distance.",

    "abstract": "The endovascular repair (EVAR) of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a bilateral common iliac artery aneurysm (CIAA) often requires exclusion of the bilateral hypogastric artery (HA), which can be associated with pelvic ischemic complications such as erectile dysfunction and buttock claudication. This study assessed the effect of HA bypass on improving pelvic circulation.\nFive patients who underwent endovascular repair with HA bypass for an AAA with bilateral CIAA were evaluated. In all patients, the patency of the inferior mesenteric artery and bilateral HAs arteries was confirmed with preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and angiography. During EVAR, penile blood flow was monitored with pulse-volume plethysmography measuring the penile brachial pressure index (PBI), and bilateral buttock blood flow was monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy measuring the gluteal tissue oxygenation index (TOI). An aortouni-external iliac artery stent graft with a crossover bypass was performed after embolization of the contralateral HA. HA bypass was performed between the crossover bypass graft and the ipsilateral HA via a retroperitoneal incision.\nUnilateral coil embolization of the contralateral side HA trunk slightly decreased blood flow to the contralateral side buttock but did not cause significant changes in penile blood flow. At the completion of EVAR, the levels of both PBI and the contralateral side TOI were significantly lower than the baseline levels. After ipsilateral side HA revascularization with HA bypass, both PBI and bilateral gluteal flow returned almost to the baseline levels. Postoperative angiography and CT scans demonstrated the patency of all HA bypasses and no endoleaks. None of the patients experienced new onset of erectile dysfunction or buttock claudication 1 month after surgery.\nBilateral HA interruption during EVAR for AAA with bilateral CIAA was associated with significant depletion of both penile and gluteal blood flow. Intraoperative monitoring of PBI and TOI at the bilateral buttocks showed significant improvement of both parameters after HA bypass. HA bypass is an excellent procedure to improve pelvic circulation despite its increased surgical complexity.",

    "abstract": "Multiple strategies have been devised to extend the applicability of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in patients with common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms. This study was designed to examine outcome in patients undergoing EVAR with either hypogastric artery embolization or common iliac artery bifurcation advancement by hypogastric bypass.\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing EVAR since the inception of our program (1997-2006) was performed. Data were prospectively collected in an EVAR registry. Patients with large common iliac artery aneurysms (> or = 20 mm) and patent hypogastric arteries not amenable to a cuff or \"bell bottom\" technique were treated with coil embolization (EMBO) and/or hypogastric revascularization (BYPASS). The perioperative and mid-term outcomes were compared with the larger group of patients undergoing EVAR that did not require either treatment (CTRL). Bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms were treated with unilateral coil embolization and contralateral bypass.\nCommon iliac artery aneurysms were present in 137 (31%) of the 444 patients undergoing EVAR, but only 57 (42%) of 137 required direct management. This included hypogastric artery embolization alone (EMBO) in 31 or hypogastric artery revascularization (BYPASS) in 26, with and without contralateral embolization (both revascularization/embolization in 46%). The procedure length (CTRL, 159 +/- 72 minutes; EMBO, 153 +/- 39 minutes; BYPASS, 283 +/- 75 minutes) and estimated blood loss (CTRL, 251 +/- 313 mL; EMBO, 233 +/- 158 mL; BYPASS, 400 +/- 287 mL) were significantly greater (P < .05) in the BYPASS group. The incidence of any postoperative complication (CTRL, 26%; EMBO, 68%; BYPASS, 54%), any ischemic complication (CTRL, 6%; EMBO, 55%; BYPASS, 27%), and new-onset buttock claudication (CTRL, 3%; EMBO, 39%; BYPASS, 27%) were all significantly greater in the BYPASS and EMBO group relative to the control (CTRL) group (n = 387). The incidence of new-onset buttock claudication ipsilateral to the hypogastric bypass was 4%; the balance of the new onset claudication in the BYPASS group was due to the contralateral embolization. The primary hypogastric artery bypass patency was 91 +/- 11% (SE) at 36 months by life-table analysis.\nDespite its increased complexity, hypogastric artery bypass is an excellent alternative to embolization in terms of patency and freedom from ischemic symptoms for patients with large common iliac artery aneurysms undergoing EVAR.",

The incidence of any postoperative complication (CTRL, 26%; EMBO, 68%; BYPASS, 54%), any ischemic complication (CTRL, 6%; EMBO, 55%; BYPASS, 27%), and new-onset buttock claudication (CTRL, 3%; EMBO, 39%; BYPASS, 27%) were all significantly greater in the BYPASS and EMBO group relative to the control (CTRL) group (n = 387). The incidence of new-onset buttock claudication ipsilateral to the hypogastric bypass was 4%; the balance of the new onset claudication in the BYPASS group was due to the contralateral embolization.

    "abstract": "To compare the clinical outcomes of treatment after endovascular repair and open surgery in patients with ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), including 1-year follow-up.\nAll consecutive conscious patients with ruptured infrarenal AAAs who presented to our tertiary care teaching hospital between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005, were included in this study (n = 55). Twenty-six patients underwent endovascular repair, and 29 patients underwent open surgery. Patients who were hemodynamically too unstable to undergo a computed tomography angiography scan were excluded. Outcomes evaluated were intraoperative mortality, 30-day mortality, systemic complications, complications necessitating surgical intervention, and mortality and complications during 1-year follow-up. The statistical tests we used were the Student t test, chi2 test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test (two sided; alpha = .05).\nThirty-day mortality was 8 (31%) of 26 patients who underwent endovascular repair and 9 (31%) of 29 patients who underwent open surgery (P = .98). Systemic complications and complications necessitating surgical intervention during the initial hospital stay were similar in both treatment groups (8/26 [31%] and 5/26 [19%] for endovascular repair, respectively, and 9/29 [31%] and 8/29 [28%] for open surgery, respectively; P > .40). During 1-year follow-up, two patients initially treated with endovascular repair died as a result of non-aneurysm-related causes; no death occurred in the open surgery group. Complications during 1-year follow-up were 1 (5%) of 20 for endovascular repair and 4 (16%) of 25 for open surgery (P = .36).\nOn the basis of our study with a highly selected population, the mortality and complication rates after endovascular repair may be similar compared with those after open surgery in patients treated for ruptured infrarenal AAAs.",

Patients with symptomatic or acute (but not ruptured) AAAs were not included in this study. Thirty-three patients underwent EVAR, and 91 underwent open repair. Seventy-two patients (EVAR, 45%; open, 63%) were classified as hemodynamically unstable at arrival, and 52 were classified as stable (EVAR, 55%; open, 37%). Ninety-seven percent of EVAR procedures commenced under local anesthesia, and 100% of open repairs occurred with general anesthesia. Overall successful graft deployment, 30-day mortality, overall reintervention rate, and complications were the study primary end points.\nOverall successful graft deployment for EVAR was 91%; for open repair, it was 96%. Overall 30-day mortality for EVAR was 30% (unstable, 53%; stable, 11%), and the rate was 46% for open repair (unstable, 61%; stable, 21%). The EVAR postoperative reintervention rate (within 30 days) was 15% (unstable, 20%; stable, 11%), and for open repair it was 10% (unstable, 9%; stable, 15%). We recorded a 27% severe complication rate for EVAR patients (unstable, 40%; stable, 17%), and for patients treated with open repair, it was 33% (unstable, 35%; stable, 29%). Our overall EVAR eligibility rate was 52%, and our overall EVAR treatment rate was 27%.\nOur study's overall results for EVAR remain encouraging when compared with those of conventional repair, but large randomized trials are required to confirm the efficacy of the procedure.",

All but one patient had refractory hypertension not responsive to contemporary medical therapy. Developmental renal artery stenoses accounted for 80% of the renal artery disease, with inflammatory and other ill-defined stenoses encountered less frequently. Splanchnic arterial occlusive lesions affected 24% and abdominal aortic coarctations, 33%.\nPrimary renal artery operations were undertaken 132 times. Procedures included resection beyond the stenosis and implantation into the aorta in 49, renal artery in 7, or superior mesenteric artery in 3; aortorenal and iliorenal bypasses with vein or iliac artery grafts in 40; focal arterioplasty in 10; resection with reanastomosis in 4; operative dilation in 4; splenorenal bypass in 2; and primary nephrectomy in 13 when arterial reconstructions proved impossible. Bilateral renal operations were done in 34 children, and 17 underwent celiac or superior mesenteric arterial reconstructions, including 15 at the time of the renal operation. Thirty patients underwent abdominal aortic reconstructions with patch aortoplasty (n = 19) or thoracoabdominal bypass (n = 11). Twenty-five of the aortic procedures were performed coincidently with the renal operations. Thirty secondary renal artery procedures were done in 19 patients, including nine nephrectomies. Hypertension was cured in 68 children (70%), improved in 26 (27%), and was unchanged in three (3%). Follow-up averaged 4.2 years. No patients required dialysis, and there were no operative deaths.\nContemporary surgical treatment of pediatric renovascular hypertension emphasizes direct aortic implantation of the normal renal artery beyond its stenosis and single-staged concomitant splanchnic and aortic reconstructions when necessary. Benefits accompany carefully executed operative procedures in 97% of these children.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral embolism is the first cause of neurologic complications of carotid artery stenting (CAS). A large debate has been raised to identify the caseload necessary for an appropriate learning curve before systematic use of CAS. This study examined (1) the timing of periprocedural complications during CAS and how these complications vary over time to identify factors that contribute to neurologic morbidity and (2) a sufficient number of procedures for adequate training.\nDuring 2001 to 2006, 627 CAS procedures with cerebral protection devices (CPD) were performed in a single vascular surgery center by a team including a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist. These represented 38% of a total of 1598 carotid revascularizations performed in the same interval. CAS procedures were divided into two groups according to time interval: the first period, 2001 to 2003, included 195 CAS procedures, and the second period, 2004 to 2006, included 432 CAS procedures. During each CAS procedure, five major steps were considered: phase 1, or the catheterization phase, included the passage of the aortic arch, catheterization of the target vessel, and introduction of a guiding catheter or sheath. Phase 2, or the crossing stenosis phase, included the placement of a CPD. Phase 3, or the stent ballooning phase, included predilation (when indicated), stent implantation, postdilation, and recovery of the protection system. Phase 4, or the early postinterventional phase, included the first 24 hours after leaving the catheterization table. Phase 5, or the late postinterventional phase, included the interval from the first postoperative day to 30 days.\nAt 30 days, 10 major strokes (2 of which were fatal) and 1 cardiac death occurred, for an overall major stroke/death rate of 1.75%. Furthermore, 18 minor strokes (2.9%) were recorded. By analyzing the occurrence of major strokes according to the three intraprocedural phases, four occurred in phase 1 and six in phase 3. All strokes but one were ischemic; six were ipsilateral, three were contralateral, and one was posterior. Minor strokes occurred prevalently after the procedure (11 in phase 4, 5 in phase 5, and 1 for phases 1 and 3). Comparing the first with the second interval of the study period, the 30-day major stroke and death rate decreased from 3.1% to 0.9% (P = .047), and the 30-day any stroke and death rate decreased from 8.2% to 2.7% (P = .005). According to multivariate analysis, study interval (hazard ratio, 3.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-9.01; P = .005) and age (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.12; P = .05) were significant predictors of stroke.\nA large proportion of major strokes (4/10) from CAS cannot be prevented by using CPD, because these strokes occur during catheterization (phase 1). This finding, together with the significant decrease in the overall stroke/death rate between the first and the last interval of the study period, enhances the importance of an appropriate learning curve that involves a caseload larger than that generally accepted for credentialing. The noticeable number of postprocedural cerebral embolizations leading to minor strokes and occurring in the early and late postinterventional phases (16/18) is likely due to factors less strictly related to the learning-curve effect, such as stent design and medical therapy. Moreover, expertise in selecting material and design of the stents according to different vessel morphology, in association with correct medical treatment, may be useful in reducing the number of minor strokes that occur in the later postinterventional phases of CAS.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing open gastric bypass (OGB) for morbid obesity are at significant risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) despite the use of subcutaneous heparin injections and sequential compression devices. Prophylactic preoperative inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement may reduce this risk. We report our experience with simultaneous IVC filter placement and OGB in an operating room setting.\nFrom July 1999 to April 2001, 193 patients (group 1) underwent OGB. Eight patients had prophylactic intraoperative IVC filters placed for deep vein thrombosis, PE, or pulmonary hypertension. From May 2001 to January 2003, 181 patients (group 2) underwent OGB. There were 33 IVC filters placed for body mass index (BMI) greater than 55 kg/m2 in addition to the above-mentioned criteria. To confirm observations made in group 1 and 2 patients, from July 2003 to May 2005, 197 patients (group 3) underwent OGB, and patients with a BMI greater than 55 kg/m2 (n = 35) were offered IVC filter placement. Group 3A (n = 17) consented to IVC filter placement, and group 3B (n = 18) did not.\nFifty-eight IVC filters were placed (100% technical success rate) with an increase in operating room time of 20 +/- 5 minutes. In group 1, the eight patients with IVC filters had a BMI greater than 55 kg/m2. There were four PEs (3 fatal and 1 nonfatal) in the other 185 patients, all which occurred in patients with BMIs greater than 55 kg/m2. In group 2, there were no PEs. The perioperative PE rate in these patients was reduced from 13% (4/31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1%-25.7%) to 0% (0/33; 95% CI, 0%-8.7%). Perioperative mortality was reduced from 10% (3/31; 95% CI, 0%-20.0%) to 0% (0/33; 95% CI, 0%-8.7%). There were no pulmonary emboli or deaths related to PE in group 3A patients. Group 3B patients had a 28% PE rate (two fatal and three nonfatal) and an 11% PE-related death rate. None of the remaining patients in group 3 had a PE.\nIntraoperative IVC filter placement for the prevention of PE in morbidly obese patients undergoing OGB is feasible. We observed a significant reduction in the perioperative PE rate when a BMI greater than 55 kg/m2 was used as an indication for IVC filter placement despite the use of subcutaneous heparin injections and sequential compression devices.",

    "abstract": "The standard technique of balloon angioplasty with or without subintimal dissection of infrainguinal arteries requires contrast arteriography and fluoroscopy. We attempted to perform this procedure with duplex guidance to avoid the use of nephrotoxic contrast material and eliminate or minimize radiation exposure.\nFrom September 2003 to June 2005, 196 patients (57% male) with a mean age of 73 +/- 10 years (range, 42-97 years) had a total of 253 attempted balloon angioplasties of the superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery under duplex guidance in 218 limbs. Critical ischemia was the indication in 38% of cases, and disabling claudication was the indication in 62%. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, smoking, and coronary artery disease were present in 78%, 51%, 41%, 39%, and 37% of patients, respectively. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification was used for morphologic description of femoral-popliteal lesions. The common femoral artery was cannulated under direct duplex visualization. Still under duplex guidance, a guidewire was directed into the proximal superficial femoral artery, across the diseased segment(s), and parked at the tibioperoneal trunk. The diseased segment(s) were then balloon-dilated. Balloon diameter and length were chosen according to arterial measurements obtained by duplex scan. Hemodynamically significant defects causing diameter reductions greater than 30% and peak systolic velocity ratios greater than 2 were stented with a variety of self-expandable stents under duplex guidance. Completion duplex examinations and ankle-brachial indices were obtained routinely before hospital discharge.\nThere were 11 (4%) TASC class A lesions, 31 (12%) TASC class B lesions, 177 (70%) TASC class C lesions, and 34 (14%) TASC class D lesions in this series. The overall technical success was 93% (236/253 cases). Eight of the 17 failed subintimal dissections belonged to TASC class C and the remaining 9 to TASC class D. End-stage renal disease was the only significant predictor of subintimal dissection failure in patients with femoral-popliteal occlusions (5/17 cases; P < .04). Intraluminal stents were placed in 153 (65%) of 236 successful cases. Overall pre-procedure and post-procedure ankle-brachial indices changed from a mean of 0.69 +/- 0.16 (range, 0.2-1.1) to 0.95 +/- 0.14 (range, 0.55-1.3), respectively (P < .0001). The mean duration of follow-up was 10 +/- 7 months (range, 1-29 months). The overall 30-day survival rate was 100%. Overall limb salvage rates were 94% and 90% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Six-month patency rates for TASC class A, B, C, and D lesions were 89%, 73%, 72%, and 63%, respectively. Twelve-month patency rates for TASC class A, B, C, and D lesions were 89%, 58%, 51%, and 45%, respectively.\nDuplex-guided balloon angioplasty and stent placement seems to be a safe and effective technique for the treatment of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease. Technical advantages include direct visualization of the puncture site, accurate selection of the proper size balloon and stent, and confirmation of the adequacy of the technique by hemodynamic and imaging parameters. Additional benefits are avoidance of radiation exposure and contrast material.",
