    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in addition to stimulating angiogenesis, also serves a repair/maintenance or survival function, modulating various aspects of endothelial cell function. This study was designed to examine the effect of VEGF pretreatment in a model of vein graft intimal hyperplasia.\nReversed jugular vein-to-common carotid artery interposition grafts were constructed in New Zealand White rabbits. White rabbits. Vein conduits were immersed in solution containing 500 micrograms rhVEGF165 or saline solution for 20 minutes before implantation. Twenty-eight days later the vein grafts and contralateral control jugular veins were harvested for either histologic or isometric tension studies.\nVEGF-treated vein grafts showed a 23% reduction in intimal area (0.76 +/- 0.07 mm2 vs 0.98 +/- 0.06 mm2; p = 0.028) and a 30% reduction in intimal thickness (62 +/- 6 microns vs 89 +/- 5 microns; p = 0.001) when compared with control grafts. After precontraction with norepinephrine, the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent, receptor-mediated agonist) for control vein grafts was 0%, whereas for VEGF-treated vein grafts it was 25% +/- 9% (p < 0.05 vs control grafts). The maximal relaxation to the calcium ionophore A23187 (endothelium-dependent, receptor-independent agonist) was also greater in VEGF-treated grafts than in control grafts (172.3% +/- 19.4% vs 122.5% +/- 13.7%; p < 0.05). There was no difference in the response to sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent agonist) between the two groups.\nA single topical application of VEGF before implantation reduces intimal hyperplasia and improves endothelial function in a rabbit vein graft model. Further evaluation of this simple strategy to improve vein graft patency appears warranted.",

    "abstract": "Greater saphenous veins removed at surgery for correction of venous dysfunction have few valves. Those that are present may be shrunken, deformed, or monocuspid. This study was carried out to determine whether leukocyte infiltration is associated with valve damage.\nSeventeen specimens were removed at surgery from five men and eight women (age, 29 to 80 years). These consisted of the proximal 15 cm of the duplex-confirmed, refluxing proximal greater saphenous vein, one proximal lesser saphenous vein, and one midportion of greater saphenous vein. The severity of venous stasis in each patient limb was classified by the CEAP formula. Twelve were class 2, two were class 3, and three were class 4. Control specimens were obtained from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. These were two men and two women, ages 72, 66, 62, and 60 years, free of venous insufficiency, with the specimens obtained from the proximal saphenous vein. Two of the control specimens contained venous valves corresponding to the test specimens. Longitudinal 10 microns paraffin sections were labeled with anti-CD64 monoclonal antibody, specific for tissue monocytes and macrophages, and studied by light microscopy. Five regions were chosen for quantification of the leukocyte infiltrate. Cells were categorized and counted directly. Volume proportions were calculated using stereologic techniques.\nThree of seven specimens studied for morphologic changes had clearly shortened valve leaflets. Collagen degeneration was noted in all seven specimens. Leaflets had essentially disappeared in three and were shortened to 100 to 2100 microns in five. Specific leukocyte staining was accomplished on 10 additional specimens. All specimens showed monocyte/macrophage infiltration in valve leaflets and venous wall. These were more numerous in the valve sinus and proximal wall both on and under the endothelium. Control specimens showed no monocyte/macrophage infiltration.\nThese observations suggest that venous valve damage in refluxing saphenous veins is associated with a leukocyte (monocyte/macrophage) infiltrate. Cell activation and fluid dynamic factors, such as eddies recirculation, and stasis in the valve sinus may be a part of the process of leukocyte penetration of the endothelium. The magnitude of leukocyte infiltration in the vein wall and in the base of the valve leaflet may be important in the genesis of primary venous dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Primary radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (RCAVFs) have classically been used for the initiation of dialysis. If a suitable forearm cephalic vein can be demonstrated, it is used to construct such a fistula. However, we have noted a tendency for RCAVF in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus (type I and type II) to remain patent but not mature to the point of cannulation. Therefore, the present study was undertaken.\nFifty-eight consecutive patients with diabetes who required initial access for hemodialysis at an urban medical center and tertiary Veterans Medical Center underwent creation of an RCAVF (n = 10), brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (BCAVF; n = 22), or transposed basilic vein arteriovenous fistula (TBAVF; n = 26). The vein used was determined by physical examination with tourniquet compression. If neither forearm or upper-arm cephalic veins were 2 mm in diameter, a TBAVF was created after venography. Patency was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimate; differences between groups were assessed by Fisher's exact test.\nThe 70% rate of nonmaturation of RCAVFs was significantly greater than the 27% rate for BCAVFs and 0% for TBAVFs (p < 0.05). The 33% cumulative primary patency rate at 18 months for RCAVFs was significantly less than 78% for BCAVFs and 79% for TBAVFs (p < 0.001). Within and between groups, there were no significant differences in age, gender, aspirin use, history of congestive heart failure, erythropoietin use, hematocrit level, history of peripheral vascular disease, or mortality rate.\nIn patients with renal failure and a history of diabetes, both primary BCAVFs and TBAVFs demonstrate significantly greater maturation and increased primary cumulative patency rates compared with RCAVFs; therefore, these autogenous conduits are considered to be optimal in this group of patients. Whether the discrepancy in lower-arm vein maturation is a result of a lack of compensatory increase in radial arterial flow or an intrinsic defect in the lower-arm cephalic vein is currently under investigation.",

    "abstract": "We examined the impact of distal aortic and visceral perfusion on liver function during thoracoabdominal and descending thoracic aortic repair.\nBetween January 1991 and July 1996, 367 patients underwent thoracoabdominal and descending thoracic aortic repair. Baseline and postoperative total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were measured for 286 patients. We examined the impact of distal aortic and direct visceral perfusion on liver function-related clinical laboratory values. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods for categorical and continuous variables were used.\nIn categorical analysis, type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, history of hepatitis, and emergency presentation had a statistically significant multivariate association with abnormal laboratory values. In continuous-distributed multivariate data analysis, type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm and visceral perfusion were statistically significant predictors of postoperative alkaline phosphatase, PT, and PTT. Type II aneurysms increased postoperative liver function-related laboratory values significantly above other aneurysm types (alkaline phosphatase, +114 IU, p < 0.0001; PT, +1.99 seconds, p < 0.02; PTT, +6.7 seconds, p < 0.03). Visceral perfusion was associated with a concomitant decrease (alkaline phosphatase, -101.2 IU, p < 0.0001; PT, -1.8 seconds, p < 0.07; PTT, -5.6 seconds, p < 0.02).\nVisceral perfusion negates the rise in postoperative liver function-related clinical laboratory values associated with type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Late graft failure is a critical problem, particularly in the presence of poor runoff vessels. Intimal hyperplasia is considered to be the main cause of graft failure. We have already reported that intimal thickening of experimental vein grafts in dogs with poor runoff vessels is more pronounced than that in dogs with normal vessels. We and others also have reported that production of nitric oxide (NO) in the endothelium of canine vein grafts is impaired. In the present study, we asked whether in vivo gene transfer of endothelial cell NO synthase (ecNOS) would inhibit intimal hyperplasia of autogenous vein grafts implanted in limbs with poor distal runoff in dogs.\nAfter exposing femoral veins, the nuclear-targeted lac Zgene, bovine ecNOS cDNA, or control vector plasmid encapsulated in the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposomes was infused intraluminally, followed by incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature under a distending pressure of 100 mm Hg. Twenty reversed vein grafts were implanted under normal runoff conditions, and 4 days later these were used to confirm gene transfer to the vein grafts. Twelve reversed vein grafts were implanted under conditions of poor runoff, and 4 weeks after the operation intimal thickening was evident.\nIn vein grafts under normal runoff conditions, lac Z gene transfer exhibited diffuse and frequent X-Gal-positive signals in both medial and adventitial layers 4 days after implantation (n = 3). In case of the ecNOS gene-transferred vein grafts, bovine ecNOS protein was mainly detected in medial smooth muscle cells and adventitial cells 4 days after implantation, determined using immunohistochemical techniques and bovine ecNOS specific antibody (n = 3). In addition, ecNOS-transferred vessels showed intense purple signals by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and nitroblue tetrazolium reaction, in both medial and adventitial layers, whereas weak NOS activity was recognized at the adventitial vasa vasorum of the untreated veins or control vector transferred veins (n = 3, respectively). In vein grafts under poor runoff conditions, the intimal thickness at 4 weeks after implantation was significantly reduced by ecNOS gene transfer (n = 4; 90.0 +/- 7.6 microns and 1.18 +/- 0.07 mm2) in comparison with buffer-treated vessels (n = 4; 195.8 +/- 25.7 microns and 2.62 +/- 0.48 mm2) or vector vehicle-treated vessels (n = 4; 193.0 +/- 15.8 microns and 2.65 +/- 0.22 mm2).\nOur findings show that gene transfer of ecNOS inhibited intimal hyperplasia of canine vein grafts caused by poor runoff conditions, as a result of an increased local production of NO. Thus ecNOS gene transfer warrants further study as a possible approach to prevent late graft failure.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether endogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) production contributes to the intimal hyperplastic response to injury in a model of rabbit femoral artery balloon injury. Inhibition of de novo production of bFGF protein was targeted by intramural adenoviral gene transfer of antisense bFGF (Ad.ASbFGF) RNA. The adenovirus was delivered locally intraluminally at the time of arterial injury.\nNew Zealand White rabbits underwent balloon injury of the superficial femoral artery, followed by intraluminal delivery of an adenoviral vector encoding a rat antisense bFGF (ASbFGF) transcript at a concentration of 1 x 10(10) plaque-forming units per milliliter. Control animals were treated in a similar fashion, using either an adenovirus encoding the lac Z reporter gene (Ad.lacZ) or phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS; vehicle) alone. Two weeks after balloon injury, rabbits were killed and perfusion fixed. Femoral arteries were harvested for histomorphometric analysis. Intimal and medial wall thickness was measured at eight points around the vessel perimeter, and mean intimal/medial (I/M) thickness ratios were compared by analysis of variance and Student's t test. In addition, medial cell proliferation in Ad.ASbFGF and Ad.lacZ treated arteries was evaluated 4 days and 2 weeks after balloon injury by 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling.\nAt 14 days (n = 25) after balloon injury, histomorphometric analysis revealed a significant inhibition of intimal thickening in Ad.ASbFGF-treated arteries as compared with Ad.lacZ-treated and PBS-treated controls (I/M thickness ratios +/- SD, 0.43 +/- 0.22 for Ad.ASbFGF vs 1.03 +/- 0.28 for Ad.lacZ and 0.86 +/- 0.19 for PBS; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.004, respectively). There was no significant difference in the I/M thickness ratios of Ad.lacZ-treated and PBS-treated vessels (p = 0.27). Although there was no significant difference in the proliferation index of Ad.ASbFGF-treated and Ad.lacZ-treated vessels 4 days after injury, an increase in apoptosis was noted in the Ad.ASbFGF-treated vessels 4 days after balloon injury.\nThe use of ASbFGF RNA gene transfer, designed to inhibit de novo bFGF synthesis after balloon injury, results in a significant inhibition of neointimal formation. This suggests that continued bFGF synthesis contributes to the arterial response to injury in rabbits. ASbFGF gene transfer may be an effective strategy in limiting the intimal hyperplastic response after vascular reconstructive procedures.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a ubiquitous signaling protein that has been associated with cellular proliferation; however, its role in cellular migration has not been established. In this study, we investigate the role of MAPK in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced migration and proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nSMC migration was measured using a microchemotaxis assay (4 hours), and proliferation was assessed using 3H-thymidine uptake and cell counts. PD098059 was used as a specific noncompetitive inhibitor of MAPK activation.\nCoincubation of SMCs with PD098059 resulted in significant inhibition of PDGF-BB (5 ng/ml)-induced SMC chemotaxis and proliferation. The IC50 for both processes was approximately 10 mumol/L with complete inhibition at 50 mumol/L. Stimulation of SMCs with PDGF produced an early peak in MAPK activity followed by a plateau of activity that persisted for 24 hours. We hypothesized that variations in the temporal activation of MAPK might explain the action of this enzyme on these two disparate cellular events. By adding PD098059 at intervals after stimulation of SMCs with PDGF, we demonstrated an association between MAPK activity within the first 15 minutes and SMC migration, whereas MAPK activity between 1 and 4 hours was associated with SMC proliferation.\nMAPK activity is essential for both SMC migration and proliferation, and distinct phases of enzyme activation are required to stimulate these two discrete cellular events. Inhibition of this signaling protein may prove to be a useful method for preventing intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The medium molecular weight fraction of pentastarch (HES-Pz) has been shown to decrease reperfusion injury to myocardium and brain by reducing capillary leak. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of HES-Pz on neurologic function, microvascular permeability, and spinal cord infarction after temporary aortic cross-clamping in a rabbit model.\nIn 30 New Zealand White rabbits, a snare occlusion device was placed around the infrarenal aorta and tunneled into a subcutaneous position. Animals were allowed to recover for 48 hours and were randomized into three groups. In each group, the infrarenal aorta was occluded by tightening the snare in the awake animal for 21 minutes. Immediately after unclamping, animals received an intravenous infusion of 4% of their estimated blood volume of one of the following solutions: normal saline solution (NS; group 1); 6% standard hydroxyethyl starch (HES), molecular weight 10 to 3400 kD (group 2); and 6% HES-Pz, molecular weight 100 to 1000 kD (group 3). During 5 days of observation, neurologic recovery was graded by an independent observer using the Tarlov scale. Animals were then killed and their spinal cords harvested for histologic examination using hematoxylin-eosin and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. In a separate group of animals (n = 15), the occurrence of spinal cord capillary permeability after NS, HES, and HES-Pz infusions was evaluated by spectrophotometric analysis of extravasated Evans blue.\nComplete paraplegia and marked histologic evidence of spinal cord cellular injury were seen in 90% of group 1 (NS) and in 78% of group 2 (HES). Treatment with HES-Pz (group 3) resulted in full neurologic recovery in 89% of animals (p < 0.05) and a threefold reduction of extravasated Evans blue compared with controls (p < 0.05).\nThese results indicate that microvascular hyperpermeability plays an important role in reperfusion injury to the spinal cord. Treatment with HES-Pz reduced the capillary permeability, neuron membrane injury, and incidence of paraplegia after reperfusion of ischemic spinal cord in a rabbit model.",

    "abstract": "The intimal hyperplasia hypothesis that equates lumen narrowing after arterial injury with intimal mass has recently been challenged. Evidence has emerged to suggest that lumen narrowing is caused in large part by changes in artery wall geometry rather than intimal mass per se. We have begun to explore this hypothesis in a unique nonhuman primate model of atherosclerosis.\nMonkeys who were fed an atherogenic diet for 3 to 5 years underwent experimental angioplasty of the left iliac artery. The contralateral iliac artery served as an intraanimal control. Arteries were removed 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, or 112 days later for analysis (6 or 13 per time point). Angioplasty dilated arteries by fracturing atheroma and stretching or tearing the media. Cross-sections of injured arteries were analyzed for expression of extracellular matrix components and cell surface integrins that are important in wound healing. Antibodies, riboprobes, or histochemical stains specific for fibrin, hyaluronan, versican (chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycan), procollagen-I, elastin, and the alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha V beta 3 integrins were used.\nA thin mural thrombus was seen at sites of denudation and plaque fracture (days 2 to 7). This provisional matrix was invaded by leukocytes (days 2 to 4) and alpha-actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs; days 4 to 7). Thrombus was replaced by SMCs expressing hyaluronan and the associated versican proteoglycans (day 14). Versican was expressed throughout the neointima as it enlarged (day 28), but expression later subsided (day 112). Procollagen-I expression initially increased in the adventitia (day 4) and then in the forming neointima (day 14). Procollagen-I expression was found to persist within the adventitia and in the neointima in SMCs nearest the lumen (days 28 to 112). Elastin staining was prominent within the mature neointima (day 112) but not at earlier time points. Integrin expression also increased within the injured artery wall. alpha v beta 3 staining (fibrin[ogen] receptor) increased in the injured media (days 2 to 7) and was then seen throughout the early neointima (day 7). Low level expression of alpha V beta 3 subsequently persisted within the forming neointima (day 28). alpha 2 beta 1 (collagen receptor) expression increased in the neointima in SMCs nearest the lumen (day 28).\nLumen narrowing after angioplasty in this model of atherosclerosis is caused largely by decreased artery wall diameter. The pattern of matrix and integrin expression within the injured artery wall is in many ways analogous to that of healing wounds. These observations suggest that tissue contraction may play a role in lumen narrowing at sites of arterial reconstruction. Strategies to inhibit wound contraction may prove effective in preventing restenosis.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to minimize costs and patient discomfort, we determined whether duplex ultrasound (DU) could selectively replace preoperative arteriography performed in the radiology suite to diagnose failing arterial bypass grafts (FABs) constructed of autogenous vein.\nBetween January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1996, we treated 106 FABs. Graft revision solely on the basis of DU was performed only if a focal stenosis was clearly identified in the graft (peak systolic velocity [PSV] > 300 cm/sec, ratio of adjacent PSVs > 3.0) or in inflow or outflow arteries (resulting in uniform graft PSVs < 45 cm/sec). Intraoperative arteriograms were frequently obtained to confirm DU findings. Preoperative arteriograms were obtained if DU revealed multiple or ill-defined stenoses, diffuse inflow or outflow arterial disease, uniformly low PSVs without an identifiable lesion, or equivocal stenosis despite clinical evidence of an FAB.\nSeventy-three (69%) FABs with 81 lesions were revised on the basis of DU only. Of 76 stenotic lesions, an intraoperative arteriogram or surgical findings confirmed a diameter stenosis of 75% to 99% in 69 grafts (91%) and stenosis of 50% to 74% in three grafts (4%). DU incorrectly identified the site of stenosis or underdiagnosed the extent of disease in four grafts (5%). DU correctly identified the site of missed arteriovenous fistulas in five grafts. The 73 FABs were treated with intraoperative balloon angioplasty (30 grafts), patch angioplasty (20), interposition or jump grafts (12), ligation of arteriovenous fistula (3), a new bypass graft (1), or a combination of these interventions (7). A significant change in intraoperative strategy potentially could have been avoided if a preoperative arteriogram had been obtained in three of the 73 FABs (4.1%).\nDU can reliably be used to revise FABs and avoid the morbidity, discomfort, and cost of confirmatory arteriography in two thirds of cases.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgery decreases postoperative pain, shortens hospital stay, and returns patients to full functional status more quickly than open surgery for a variety of surgical procedures. This study was undertaken to evaluate laparoscopic techniques for application to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nTwenty patients who had AAAs that required a tube graft underwent laparoscopically assisted AAA repair. The procedure consisted of transperitoneal laparoscopic dissection of the aneurysm neck and iliac vessels. A standard endoaneurysmorrhaphy was then performed through a minilaparotomy using the port sites for the aortic and iliac clamps. Data included operative times, duration of nasogastric suction, intensive care unit days, and postoperative hospital days. Pulmonary artery catheters and transesophageal echocardiography were used in seven patients. For these patients data included heart rate, pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, and end diastolic area. Data were obtained before induction, during and after insufflation, during aortic cross-clamp, and at the end of the procedure.\nLaparoscopically assisted AAA repair was completed in 18 of 20 patients. Laparoscopic and total operative times were 1.44 +/- 0.44 and 4.1 +/- 0.92 hours, respectively. Duration of nasogastric suction was 1.3 +/- 0.7 days. Intensive care unit stay was 2.2 +/- 0.9 days. The mean length of hospital stay was 5.8 days excluding three patients who underwent other procedures. There were two minor complications, one major complication (colectomy after colon ischemia), and no deaths. For the eight patients who had intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring, no changes were noted in heart rate, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac index. Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure and central venous pressure were greatest during insufflation without changes in end-diastolic area. Volume status, as reflected by end-diastolic area and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, did not change.\nLaparoscopically assisted AAA repair is technically challenging but feasible. Potential advantages may be early removal of nasogastric suction, shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays, and prompt return to full functional status. The hemodynamic data obtained from the pulmonary artery catheter and transesophageal echocardiogram during pneumoperitoneum suggest that transesophageal echocardiography may be sufficient for evaluation of volume status along with the added benefit of detection of regional wall motion abnormalities and aortic insufficiency. Further refinement in technique and instrumentation will make total laparoscopic AAA repair a reality.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete endovascular graft exclusion of an abdominal aortic aneurysm results in an endoleak. To better understand the pathogenesis, significance, and fate of endoleaks, we analyzed our experience with endovascular aneurysm repair.\nBetween November 1992 and May 1997, 47 aneurysms were treated. In a phase I study, patients received either an endovascular aortoaortic graft (11) or an aortoiliac, femorofemoral graft (8). In phase II, procedures and grafts were modified to include aortofemoral, femorofemoral grafts (28) that were inserted with juxtarenal proximal stents, sutured endovascular distal anastomoses within the femoral artery, and hypogastric artery coil embolization. Endoleaks were detected by arteriogram, computed tomographic scan, or duplex ultrasound. Classification systems to describe anatomic, chronologic, and physiologic endoleak features were developed, and aortic characteristics were correlated with endoleak incidence.\nEndoleaks were discovered in 11 phase I patients (58%) and only six phase II patients (21%; p < 0.05). Aneurysm neck lengths 2 cm or less increased the incidence of endoleaks (p < 0.05). Although not significant, aneurysms with patent side branches or severe neck calcification had a higher rate of endoleaks than those without these features (47% vs 29% and 57% vs 33%, respectively), and patients with iliac artery occlusive disease had a lower rate of endoleaks than those without occlusive disease (18% vs 42%). Endoleak classifications revealed that most endoleaks were immediate, without outflow, and persistent (71% each), proximal (59%), and had aortic inflow (88%). One patient with a persistent endoleak had aneurysm rupture and died.\nEndoleaks complicate a significant number of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs and may permit aneurysm growth and rupture. The type of graft used, the technique of graft insertion, and aortic anatomic features all affect the rate of endoleaks. Anatomic, chronologic, and physiologic classifications can facilitate endoleak reporting and improve understanding of their pathogenesis, significance, and fate.",

    "abstract": "We studied the relationship of neurologic deficit to ligation, reimplantation, and preexisting occlusion of intercostal arteries to determine which arteries and consequent management are most critical to outcome in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nFrom February 1991 to July 1996, 343 patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms underwent repair by one surgeon. In this study, only Crawford types I, II, and III (n = 264) were considered. Of these, 110 (42%) were type I, 116 (44%) type II, and 38 (14%) type III. The adjuncts of distal aortic perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid drainage were used in 164 patients (62%). Data were analyzed by contingency table and by multiple logistic regression.\nEarly neurologic deficit occurred in 23 patients (8.7%), and late deficit in 10 patients (3.8%). Neurologic deficit in patients with at least one reimplantation and no ligation of arteries T11 or T12 occurred in 19 of 147 (12.9%). Neurologic deficit for occlusion of the same arteries occurred in 11 of 111 (9.9%), whereas for ligation of T11 and T12 neurologic deficit occurred in three of six (50%; reimplantation, p < 0.03; occlusion, p < 0.006). In addition, reimplantation of intercostal arteries T9 or T10 was significantly associated with reduced late neurologic deficit in multivariate analysis (p = 0.05). No other intercostal artery status was associated with modification of the neurologic deficit rate. Multivariate analysis showed type II aneurysms and acute dissections to be significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative neurologic deficit (p < 0.0009, 0.002, respectively). Adjuncts were protective (p < 0.007), most often in types II and III (14.1% neurologic deficit in type II with adjunct, 35.3% without; 0% in type III with adjunct, 20% without).\nPatients with patent arteries at the T11/T12 level have highly variable outcomes depending on whether the arteries are reattached or ligated. Our data suggest that reimplantation of thoracic intercostal arteries T11 and T12 is indicated when these arteries are patent. Reimplantation of T9 and T10 lowers the risk of late neurologic deficit, probably by decreasing the spinal cord's vulnerability to changes in blood and cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the days after surgery. Adjuncts lower overall risk and provide adequate time for targeted intercostal artery reimplantation.",

Neurologic deficit in patients with at least one reimplantation and no ligation of arteries T11 or T12 occurred in 19 of 147 (12.9%). Neurologic deficit for occlusion of the same arteries occurred in 11 of 111 (9.9%), whereas for ligation of T11 and T12 neurologic deficit occurred in three of six (50%; reimplantation, p < 0.03; occlusion, p < 0.006). In addition, reimplantation of intercostal arteries T9 or T10 was significantly associated with reduced late neurologic deficit in multivariate analysis (p = 0.05). No other intercostal artery status was associated with modification of the neurologic deficit rate. Multivariate analysis showed type II aneurysms and acute dissections to be significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative neurologic deficit (p < 0.0009, 0.002, respectively). Adjuncts were protective (p < 0.007), most often in types II and III (14.1% neurologic deficit in type II with adjunct, 35.3% without; 0% in type III with adjunct, 20% without).",

    "abstract": "Despite the frequent occurrence of isolated calf vein thrombosis (ICVT), little is known about the long-term clinical and hemodynamic sequelae of this condition. This study was conducted to determine late clinical symptoms and vascular laboratory abnormalities in patients after ICVT.\nOf 146 patients in whom ICVT was documented by color flow duplex scanning between 1989 and 1994, 37 were reexamined. Data included history, physical examination, venous recovery time (VRT), and duplex valve closure time (DVCT). A control group with no history of venous disease also underwent identical clinical and hemodynamic testing.\nThirty-seven patients (18 male and 19 female) with a median age of 56 years (range, 22 to 76 years) were examined at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (range, 2.2 to 5.8 years) after the diagnosis of ICVT in 39 extremities. Seventeen subjects (34 extremities) were recruited as normal controls. Presenting symptoms at the time of ICVT included calf pain in 17 patients, calf swelling in seven, pain and swelling in seven, pulmonary symptoms in four, pulmonary symptoms and calf pain in one, and no symptoms in one. In the patients with ICVT, VRT was abnormal in 23% of extremities with ICVT and in 9% of extremities without ICVT. None of the extremities in the control group had an abnormal VRT (p < 0.05). DVCT was abnormal in one or more venous segments in 26% of extremities diagnosed with ICVT and in 6% of control extremities (p < 0.05). Follow-up clinical examination in patients with ICVT revealed 13 (35%) with reticular veins, 10 (27%) with varicose veins, two (5.4%) with edema, one (2.7%) with pigmentation and ulcer (contralateral extremity to ICVT with a previous history of proximal deep venous thrombosis), 13 (35%) with mild discomfort, and one (2.7%) with severe pain. All symptoms attributable to ICVT were mild in nature except in one patient who had severe pain and no physical or hemodynamic vascular laboratory abnormalities at follow-up.\nAt an average of 3.4 years after ICVT, approximately one third of patients showed evidence of mild to moderate venous valvular insufficiency, but mostly in segments not involved with ICVT, and few had significant clinical symptoms attributable to venous disease.",

    "abstract": "Early amputation has been suggested to be the optimal treatment for severe combined vascular and neural injuries of the proximal upper extremity. This retrospective study was done to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome of our policy of limb salvage by revascularization and delayed treatment of neural injuries.\nForty-six patients with neural and vascular trauma to the upper extremity were treated at our institution. All of these patients had aggressive treatment directed at limb salvage with restoration of vascular supply and nerve function. Long-term vascular and neurologic outcomes were recorded. Neurologic deficits were validated by the American Medical Association's standardized disability impairment scale (0% to 100%).\nThe rate of preoperative disability was 83%, which improved to 52% (p < 0.01) after treatment (mean follow-up, 43 months). Overall, 87% showed improvement.\nThese results suggest that early amputation should not be performed unless there is massive tissue loss or an attempt at limb salvage might endanger life. Final outcomes cannot be predicted on the basis of initial clinical presentation. As a group, the majority of these patients improved with aggressive intervention.",

    "abstract": "This is a review of 100 consecutive supraaortic trunk reconstructions (SAT) performed over 16 years.\nThere were eight innominate endarterectomies and 92 bypass procedures based on the thoracic aorta (n = 86) or proximal innominate artery (n = 6) in 98 patients 24 to 79 years of age. Indications included cerebrovascular ischemia in 83 and upper extremity ischemia in four. Thirteen patients were asymptomatic. An innominate lesion was bypassed in 78 cases. The left common carotid and left subclavian arteries required reconstruction in 38 and nine patients, respectively. Multiple trunks were reconstructed by direct bypass grafting in 35. Approach was via median sternotomy in 92, partial sternotomy in six, and left thoracotomy in two. Seven patients underwent concomitant cardiac surgery.\nEight deaths and eight nonfatal strokes occurred, for a combined stroke/death rate of 16%. The operative mortality rate was 6% for SAT and 29% for SAT/cardiac operations. Perioperative complications included two asymptomatic graft occlusions, three nonfatal myocardial infarctions, seven significant pulmonary complications, three sternal wound infections, and one recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 184 months (mean, 51 +/- 4.8 months). Eight patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty-one late deaths occurred. Two SATs required late revision. The cumulative primary patency rates at 5 and 10 years were 94% +/- 3% and 88% +/- 6%, respectively. The stroke-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 87% +/- 4% and 81% +/- 7%, respectively. Patients who survived beyond 30 days had a median stroke-free life expectancy of 10 years, 7 months (SE, 6%).\nDirect reconstruction of complex symptomatic SAT lesions can be performed with acceptable death/stroke rates and with long-term patient benefit. Asymptomatic lesions in patients who have significant concomitant conditions should be managed with a less-morbid cervical or endovascular approach, even if long-term outcome of the latter is inferior.",

During a concurrent 14-month period, 218 patients were admitted 229 times for 234 procedures for the treatment of 239 carotid bifurcation stenoses, 109 by PTAS and 130 by CEA. Hospital charges were reviewed for each hospitalization and were categorized according to radiology, operating room, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and all other hospital charges.\nThe combined incidence of postprocedure strokes and deaths were: PTAS, eight strokes (7.7%) and one death (0.9%); CEA, two strokes (1.5%) and two deaths (1.5%). Total hospital charges per admission for the two groups were $30,140 for PTAS and $21,670 for CEA.

    "abstract": "Several centers use atriodistal bypass (ADB) as a protective adjunct against distal ischemia during extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Most current ADB circuits use indirect-drive centrifugal pumps. The purpose of this report is to describe our initial clinical experience with the Nikkiso pump, a more compact direct-drive centrifugal pump recently developed at Baylor, for ADB during TAAA repair.\nThe Nikkiso pump was used for ADB perfusion in 10 consecutive patients during graft repair of TAAAs (six Crawford extent I and four extent II). Two patients had aortic dissection. In the four patients who had extent II repairs, selective renal and visceral perfusion was also performed with the Nikkiso pump.\nNo mechanical pump malfunctions or adverse events related to the device occurred. All 10 patients survived and were discharged from the hospital. No patient had paraplegia after surgery. Two patients had delayed lower extremity weakness after undergoing extent I repairs; both recovered and were ambulating at the time of discharge. No complications were associated with bleeding or cerebral, respiratory, renal, or hepatic function.\nOur initial experience with the Nikkiso centrifugal pump during TAAA repair demonstrated excellent pump function that provided sufficient flow for both distal aortic and selective organ perfusion. The prevention of permanent spinal cord injury and distal organ failure was successful in this group.",

All treated aneurysms were electively ligated and excised as an ambulatory procedure.\nThe symptoms were resolved. No recurrences or other complications were seen.\nAlthough rare, a superficial temporal artery aneurysm should be considered when a temporal head mass is evaluated. This condition is almost always a result of blunt or penetrating head trauma. Clinical examination is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Simple elective ligation and excision of the aneurysm is curative.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by degradation of the extracellular matrix, with a reduction in the elastin concentration of the arterial media. These changes are mediated by increased levels of endogenous metalloproteinases (MMPs) within the aorta, which provide a potential therapeutic target for pharmacologic agents aimed at reducing the growth rate of small aneurysms. In this study, the ability of doxycycline--an MMP inhibitor--to reduce matrix degradation was assessed in a previously described model of aneurysmal disease that used a brief pulse of elastase to induce MMP production and elastin degradation in arterial organ cultures.\nPorcine aortic segments (n = 8) were preincubated in exogenous pancreatic elastase for 24 hours before culture in standard conditions for 13 days with both 1 and 10 mg/L doxycycline. Control segments were cultured both without doxycycline and without elastase. At the termination of culture, MMPs were extracted from the tissue and quantified by a combination of substrate gel enzymography and immunoblotting. The volume fractions of elastin and collagen were determined by stereologic analysis of sections stained with Miller's elastin and van Gieson's stain.\nStereologic analysis demonstrated a significant preservation of elastin in aorta treated with doxycycline 10 mg/L (p < 0.001) and demonstrated that this preservation was accompanied by a significant reduction in MMP-9 activity (p < 0.02). Immunoblotting for tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) showed no decreased production in the doxycycline-treated groups.\nTherapeutic ranges of doxycycline significantly inhibited elastin degradation and MMP-9 production within aortic organ cultures. These data suggest that doxycycline may have a potential application in reducing the growth rates of small abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to acquire insight into the interpretation of intravascular ultrasound images of the abdominal aorta and to assess to what extent this technique can provide useful parameters for the endovascular treatment of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nThis was a descriptive study.\nFifteen abdominal aortic specimens (normal, atherosclerotic, or aneurysmal) were studied. Ultrasonic images and corresponding histologic sections were compared for vessel wall characteristics, lesion morphologic characteristics, and lumen diameter. The length of the aneurysm and the length of the proximal and distal neck were measured and compared with external measurements. Tomographic images were reconstructed to a three-dimensional format.\nNormal aortic wall was seen as a two- or three-layered structure corresponding with intima, media, and adventitia. A distinction could be made among fibrous lesion, calcified lesion, and thrombus and between normal and aneurysmal aorta. Correlation between the histologic specimens and intravascular ultrasonography for lumen diameter measurements was high (r = 0.93; p < 0.001). In a similar fashion, correlation between external measurements and intravascular ultrasound measurements on the length of the aneurysm and its proximal and distal neck was high (r = 0.99; p < 0.001). Three-dimensional analysis enhanced interpretation of the tomographic images by visualizing the spatial position of anatomic structures and contributed to understanding the shape and dimensions of the aneurysm.\nIntravascular ultrasonography provides accurate information on the vessel wall, lesion morphologic characteristics, and quantitative parameters of the abdominal aorta. Spatial information supplied by three-dimensional analysis contributes to a more realistic interpretation of the tomographic images.",

In this series STP of the proximal greater saphenous vein extended into the common femoral vein in 8.6% of the cases, of which 10% embolized to the lungs. When the DVS is involved, standard deep venous thrombosis treatment (heparin, warfarin, bed rest) should be instituted. We recommend duplex imaging for STP involving the greater saphenous vein in the thigh to rule out occult deep venous thrombosis. STP is not always benign and self-limiting as previously described.",

    "abstract": "Controversy exists regarding the best technique to identify cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Regional anesthesia allows continuous evaluation of neurologic function and therefore can help determine the incidence, timing, and causes of cerebral ischemia.\nThe timing and clinical manifestations of any neurologic event during CEA and as long as 30 days afterward was determined by review of operative reports, hospital charts, and outpatient records of consecutive patients who underwent CEA under regional anesthesia over a 68-month period.\nTwo hundred patients underwent CEA; indications were asymptomatic stenosis > 60% in 25%, transient ischemic attack with stenosis > 50% in 52%, and prior stroke with stenosis > 50% in 23%. Eight patients (4%) were converted to general anesthesia for non-ischemic reasons. Of the remaining 192 patients, 183 (95.5%) underwent the procedure with regional anesthesia and no shunt, 2% had cerebral ischemia and underwent shunt placement, and 2.5% had cerebral ischemia, were converted to general anesthesia, and underwent shunt placement. Cerebral ischemia developed in nine patients after carotid cross-clamping, manifested by loss of consciousness in four, confusion in two, dysarthria and confusion in one, and decreased contralateral motor strength in two. Immediate cerebral ischemia developed in four of the nine patients within 1 minute of cross-damping; all four underwent shunt placement. In five of the nine patients, cerebral ischemia occurred between 20 and 30 minutes after cross-clamping; all occurred during relative intraoperative hypotension (average reduction of 35 mm Hg in the systolic pressure). All awake patients in whom ischemic symptoms developed immediately regained and maintained normal neurologic function with shunt placement. Five of 26 patients (19%) with contralateral occlusion required a shunt; none had postoperative ischemia. The mean carotid cross-clamp time was 27 minutes. Postoperative (30 day) complications included a 0.5% stroke rate, a 0.5% rate of postoperative transient ischemic attack, a 0.5% rate of worsening of preexisting acute stroke, and a 0.5% rate of myocardial infarction (no deaths). Of the nine patients who had intraoperative ischemic changes, none had a postoperative neurologic deficit; the three patients who had postoperative neurologic changes had no intraoperative ischemic symptoms.\nCEA with regional anesthesia allows continuous neurologic monitoring and can be performed safely even when contralateral occlusion coexists; intraoperative shunting for ischemia is necessary in 4.5% of all cases and in 19% of patients with contralateral occlusion. Intraoperative ischemia was flow-related in our patients; it occurred early from ipsilateral carotid clamping and late from reduced collateral flow as a result of hypotension. Monitoring should be continued throughout cross-clamping to identify late cerebral ischemia. Postoperative cerebral ischemia is not associated with intraoperative ischemia, if corrected.",

    "abstract": "This study was carried out to determine whether early failure of infrainguinal bypass grafts is associated with increased expression of platelet thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptors. A prospective correlation of preoperative platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor-mediated activity with lower extremity graft patency was sought.\nTwenty-five patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass surgery for limb salvage were studied at an inpatient academic tertiary referral center and Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Outcome measures were primary graft patency rate at 3 months, platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor activity by equilibrium binding with 125I-BOP, and aggregation to the TXA2-mimetic U46619.\nPreoperative platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor density was higher (Bmax, 3100 +/- 1300 vs 1500 +/- 1100 sites/platelet [mean +/- SD]; p = 0.004) in the five patients who had graft thrombosis within 3 months. The EC50 for U46619 was lower (26 +/- 6 nmol/L vs 57 +/- 30 nmol/L; p < 0.05) in these patients as well, confirming the functional effect of the increased receptor density. Early graft thrombosis was more likely in patients with a platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor density greater than 3000 sites/platelet (odds ratio, 76; 95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 1500) or an EC50 for U46619 less than 30 nmol/L (odds ratio, 16; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 180).\nElevated platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor levels and enhanced sensitivity of platelet aggregation to TXA2 predict early arterial graft thrombosis. Specific TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonism may prevent one of the mechanisms that contributes to early graft occlusion.",

    "abstract": "We reported a 61% morbidity rate and a 23% mortality rate for the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) syndrome in 1983. We subsequently reported in 1987 that with early recognition, immediate cessation of the administration of heparin, and platelet function inhibition, the morbidity rate could be reduced to 23% and the mortality rate to 12%. One hundred recent cases of patients with heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies (HAAb) have been reviewed to determine whether aggressive screening, early diagnosis, and alternate management could further reduce morbidity and mortality rates.\nThe consecutive records of 100 patients with positive platelet aggregation tests were reviewed. Sixty-six patients were male. The patients' ages ranged from 23 days to 92 years. The patients were from vascular (28), cardiothoracic (42), and other (30) services. HIT was suspected in patients who received heparin and had falling platelet counts, platelet counts less than 100,000/mm3, or new thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events.\nHeparin was not offered to six patients with known HAAb. Twelve patients were successfully treated with antiplatelet therapy and limited reexposure to heparin, and 75 patients were successfully treated with early diagnosis and prompt cessation of heparin. Alternate forms of anticoagulation therapy were used selectively. Seven patients had 11 complications. Three of the seven patients were treated successfully with warfarin anticoagulation and aspirin (2) or with aspirin alone (1). A fourth patient was treated with thrombectomy, hematoma evacuation, and aspirin. A fifth patient underwent thrombolysis and coronary angioplasty in addition to receiving warfarin and aspirin. The sixth patient required two thrombectomies and warfarin. A seventh patient required two thrombectomies and aspirin. HIT was responsible for one of 17 deaths.\nA 7.4% morbidity rate and a 1.1% mortality rate have been achieved in patients with HAAb by aggressive screening, early recognition of HIT, and prompt cessation of the administration of heparin. Platelet function inhibitors and other anticoagulants, including nonreacting low molecular weight heparin, are important adjuncts in the management of the thromboembolic disorders associated with HIT.",

    "abstract": "We studied the efficacy of preoperative noninvasive assessment of the upper extremity to identify arteries and veins suitable for hemodialysis access to increase our use of autogenous fistulas (AF).\nFrom Sep. 1, 1994, to Apr. 1, 1997, 172 patients who required chronic hemodialysis underwent segmental upper extremity Doppler pressures and duplex ultrasound with mapping of arteries and veins. The following criteria were necessary for satisfactory arterial inflow: absence of a pressure gradient between arms, patent palmar arch, and arterial lumen diameter 2.0 mm or more. The criteria necessary for satisfactory venous outflow were venous luminal diameter greater than or equal to 2.5 mm for AF and greater than or equal to 4.0 mm for synthetic bridging grafts (BG) and continuity with distal superficial veins in the arm. Intraoperative and duplex ultrasound measurements were compared. Contemporary experience was compared with the 2-year period (1992 to 1994) before implementation of the protocol.\nDuring the period from Sep. 1, 1994, to Apr. 1, 1997, 108 patients (63%) had AF, 52 (30%) had prosthetic BG, and 12 (7%) had permanent catheters (PC) placed. Early failure was seen in 8.3% of AFs. Primary cumulative patency rates were 83% for AF and 74% for BG at 1 year (p < 0.05), with a mean clinical follow-up of 15.2 months. No postoperative infections were observed with AF, whereas six infections (12%) were observed with BG and two (17%) with PC insertion. During the period from June 1, 1992, to Aug. 31, 1994, 183 procedures were performed with a distribution of 14% AF, 62% BG, and 24% PC. In this earlier period the AF early failure rate was 36%, and the patency rates were 48%, 63%, and 48% for AF, BG, and PC, respectively (mean follow-up, 13.8 months).\nA protocol of noninvasive assessment increased use of AFs. The cumulative patency rate of AFs was improved, and early failure rates were reduced when compared with the preceding institutional experience.

    "abstract": "Superior vena cava (SVC) reconstructions are rarely performed; therefore the need for surveillance and the results of secondary interventions are unknown.\nDuring a 14-year period 19 patients (11 male, 8 female; mean age 41.9 years, range 8 to 69 years) underwent SVC reconstruction for symptomatic nonmalignant disease. Causes included mediastinal fibrosis (n = 12), indwelling foreign bodies (n = 4), idiopathic thrombosis (n = 2), and antithrombin III deficiency (n = 1). Spiral saphenous vein graft (n = 14), polytetrafluoroethylene (n = 4), or human allograft (n = 1) was implanted.\nNo early death or pulmonary embolism occurred. Four early graft stenoses or thromboses (spiral saphenous vein graft, n = 2, polytetrafluoroethylene, n = 2) required thrombectomy, with success in three. During a mean follow-up of 49.5 months (range, 4.7 to 137 months), 95 imaging studies were performed (average, five per patient; range, one to 10 studies). Venography detected mild or moderate graft stenosis in seven patients; two progressed to severe stenosis. Two additional grafts developed early into severe stenosis. Four of 19 grafts occluded during follow-up (two polytetrafluoroethylene, two spiral saphenous vein graft). Computed tomography failed to identify stenosis in two grafts, magnetic resonance imaging failed to confirm one stenosis and one graft occlusion, and duplex scanning was inconclusive on graft patency in 10 patients. Angioplasty was performed in all four patients with severe stenosis, with simultaneous placement of Wallstents in two. One of the Wallstents occluded at 9 months. Repeat percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was necessary in two patients, with placement of Palmaz stents in one. Only one graft occlusion and one severe graft stenosis occurred beyond 1 year. The primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were 61%, 78%, and 83% at 1 year and 53%, 70%, and 74% at 5 years, respectively.\nLong-term secondary patency rates justify SVC grafting for benign disease. Postoperative surveillance with contrast venography is indicated in the first year to detect graft problems. Endovascular techniques may salvage and improve the patency of SVC grafts.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent visceral ischemia after a failed visceral revascularization occurs in up to one third of patients, yet no comprehensive report has described the management of this problem. The purpose of this study was to examine the presentation, surgical management, and outcome of patients with recurrent visceral ischemia.\nBetween 1959 and 1997, 109 patients underwent primary visceral revascularization at the University of California, San Francisco. Nineteen patients (17.4%) had recurrent visceral ischemia (12 chronic visceral ischemia, seven acute visceral ischemia). Fourteen additional patients with recurrent chronic visceral ischemia were referred after failed primary revascularization (two patients underwent multiple operations before referral). Thirty visceral reoperations were performed for recurrent visceral ischemia in 24 patients (10 patients with recurrence at University of California, San Francisco, 14 referred patients). Symptom-free and overall survival rates were determined by life table analysis.\nOf seven patients (6.4%) who had recurrent acute visceral ischemia, six (85.7%) died of bowel infarction. Twelve patients (11%) had recurrent chronic visceral ischemia. Patients with recurrent chronic visceral ischemia received their diagnoses earlier and lost less weight than at their initial presentation (p = 0.004 and 0.001, respectively). Recurrent ischemia was associated with younger age, greater weight loss, and modification of surgical technique at the time of initial operation (p = 0.5, 0.009, and 0.02, respectively). For 20 (90.9%) of the 22 first reoperations, antegrade aortovisceral bypass (n = 10) or transaortic visceral endarterectomy (n = 10) was used. Multiple techniques (four antegrade bypass, two retrograde bypass, one endarterectomy, one anastomotic revision) were used in the eight second or third reoperations. Postoperative mortality and complication rates were 6.7% and 33.3%, respectively. Symptoms recurred in six of 22 patients (27.3%) after the first reoperation, three of whom were cured or improved after additional reoperations. The life table symptom-free survival rate after reoperation was 77.3% and 62.8% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The life table overall survival rate after reoperation was 74.6% at 5 years.\nRecurrent visceral ischemia is not uncommon after primary visceral revascularization. These results show that reoperation for recurrent chronic visceral ischemia can be accomplished safely and effectively with established revascularization techniques. Furthermore, after repeat visceral revascularization patients achieve durable relief of symptoms and have life expectancy rates comparable with those of patients who undergo primary visceral revascularization.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of cilostazol on walking distances in patients with intermittent claudication (IC) caused by peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\nThe study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundred thirty-nine patients with IC were randomly assigned to receive cilostazol (100 mg b.i.d.) or a placebo for 16 weeks. All patients underwent serial, variable-grade, constant-speed treadmill testing. Absolute claudication distance (ACD), assessed at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval (trough), was the primary end point. Secondary end points included ACD assessed 3 to 4 hours after dosing (peak) and initial claudication distances (trough and peak). Functional status measures, including the Medical Outcomes Scale (SF-36) and Walking Impairment Questionnaire, were used to assess subjective changes over the 16-week treatment period. Ankle-brachial indexes were calculated from Doppler-measured systolic pressures at every visit with treadmill testing.\nPatients treated with cilostazol demonstrated significant improvements over the placebo patients in ACD at all three time points tested after baseline (weeks 8, 12, and 16). Peak treadmill testing at weeks 8 and 12 also showed significant improvement in walking distances for cilostazol-treated patients over placebo-treated patients. At week 16, patients in the cilostazol group had a 96.4-meter (47%) increase in ACD compared with 31.4 meters (12.9%) for the placebo group (p < 0.001). In the SF-36, significant improvement was observed in the physical component subscale and the composite physical component score. In the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, improvements were significant in patient reports of walking speed and specific measures of walking difficulty. Ankle-brachial indexes improved in the cilostazol group (0.64 +/- 0.02 to 0.70 +/- 0.02) compared with the placebo group (0.68 +/- 0.02 to 0.69 +/- 0.02) (p < 0.0125). The most frequent adverse events were headache, abnormal stools (e.g. loose stools), diarrhea, and dizziness.\nCilostazol significantly increased ACD at all measured time points and initial claudication distances at most time points. This agent may represent a new treatment option for patients with intermittent claudication.",

Peak treadmill testing at weeks 8 and 12 also showed significant improvement in walking distances for cilostazol-treated patients over placebo-treated patients. At week 16, patients in the cilostazol group had a 96.4-meter (47%) increase in ACD compared with 31.4 meters (12.9%) for the placebo group (p < 0.001). In the SF-36, significant improvement was observed in the physical component subscale and the composite physical component score. In the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, improvements were significant in patient reports of walking speed and specific measures of walking difficulty. Ankle-brachial indexes improved in the cilostazol group (0.64 +/- 0.02 to 0.70 +/- 0.02) compared with the placebo group (0.68 +/- 0.02 to 0.69 +/- 0.02) (p < 0.0125).

    "abstract": "The outcome of infrainguinal bypass surgery for limb salvage has traditionally been assessed by graft patency rates, limb salvage rates, and patient survival rates. Recently, functional outcome of limb salvage surgery has been assessed by patient ambulatory status and independent living status. These assessments fail to consider the adverse long-term patient effects of delayed wound healing, episodes of recurrent ischemia, and need for repeat operations. An ideal result of infrainguinal bypass surgery for limb salvage includes an uncomplicated operation, elimination of ischemia, prompt wound healing, and rapid return to premorbid functional status without recurrence or repeat surgery. The present study was performed to determine how often this ideal result is actually achieved.\nThe records of 112 consecutive patients who underwent initial infrainguinal bypass surgery for limb salvage 5 to 7 years before the study were reviewed for operative complications, graft patency, limb salvage, survival, patient functional status, time to achieve wound healing, need for repeat operations, and recurrence of ischemia.\nThe mean patient age was 66 years. The mean postoperative follow-up was 42 months (range, 0 to 100.1 months). After operation 99 patients (88%) lived independently at home and 103 (92%) were ambulatory. There were seven perioperative deaths (6.3%), and wound complications occurred in 27 patients (24%). By life table, the assisted primary graft patency and limb salvage rates of the index extremity 5 years after operation were 77% and 87%, respectively, and the patient survival rate was 49%. At last follow-up or death, 73% of the patients (72 of 99) who lived independently at home before the operation were still living independently at home, and 70% (72 of 103) of those who were ambulatory before the operation remained ambulatory. Wound (operative and ischemic) healing required a mean of 4.2 months (range, 0.4 to 48 months), and 25 patients (22%) had not achieved complete wound healing at the time of last follow-up or death. Repeat operations to maintain graft patency, treat wound complications, or treat recurrent or contralateral ischemia were required in 61 patients (54%; mean, 1.6 reoperations/patient), and 26 patients (23.2%) ultimately required major limb amputation of the index or contralateral extremity. Only 16 of 112 patients (14.3%) achieved the ideal surgical result of an uncomplicated operation with long-term symptom relief, maintenance of functional status, and no recurrence or repeat operations.\nMost patients who undergo infrainguinal bypass surgery for limb salvage require ongoing treatment and have persistent or recurrent symptoms until their death. A significant minority have major tissue loss despite successful initial surgery. Clinically important palliation is frequently achieved by bypass surgery, but ideal results are distinctly infrequent.",

    "abstract": "The benefit of carotid endarterectomy for patients who are asymptomatic with > 60% carotid stenosis has been established by the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS). Which screening strategy is most appropriate is still unclear. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening for asymptomatic carotid stenosis.\nCost-effectiveness analysis was performed with a Markov model and with data from ACAS and other studies.\nFor 60-year-old patients with a 5% prevalence of 60% to 99% asymptomatic stenosis, duplex ultrasound screening increased average quality-adjusted life years (QALY; 11.485 vs 11.473) and lifetime cost of care ($5500 vs $5012) under base-case assumptions. The incremental cost per QALY gained (cost-effectiveness ratio) was $39,495. Screening was cost-effective with the following conditions: disease prevalence was 4.5% or more, the specificity of the screening test (ultrasound) was 91% or more, the stroke rate of patients who were medically treated was 3.3% or more, the relative risk reduction of surgery was 37% or more, the stroke rate associated with surgery was 160% or less than that of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial or ACAS perioperative complication rates, and the cost of ultrasound screening was $300 or less. A one-time screening, compared with a screening every 5 years, had more QALY (11.485 vs 11.482) and lower cost ($5500 vs $5790). Screening without arteriography, compared with screening with arteriographic verification, provided few additional QALYs (11.486 vs 11.485) at additional cost ($6896 vs $5500). The cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to assumptions about the stroke rate of patients who were asymptomatic and other variables.\nScreening for asymptomatic carotid stenosis can be cost-effective when both screening and carotid endarterectomy are performed in centers of excellence.",

    "abstract": "Anatomic features, such as a high carotid bifurcation (< 1.5 cm from the angle of the mandible), excessive distal extent of plaque (> 2.0 cm above the carotid bifurcation), or a small diameter (< or = 0.5 cm) redundant or kinked internal carotid artery can complicate carotid endarterectomy. In the past, arteriography was the only preoperative study capable of imaging these features. This study assessed the ability of duplex ultrasound to evaluate their presence before surgery.\nA consecutive series of 20 patients who underwent 21 carotid endarterectomies had preoperative duplex ultrasound evaluations of these anatomic features. These evaluations were correlated with operative measurements from an observer blinded to the duplex findings.\nThe mean difference between duplex and operative measurements for the distance between the carotid bifurcation and the angle of the mandible, the distal extent of plaque, and the internal carotid artery diameter was 0.9 cm, 0.3 cm, and 0.8 mm, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.86, 0.75, and 0.59, respectively. Duplex ultrasound predicted a high carotid bifurcation, excessive distal extent of plaque, or a redundant or kinked internal carotid artery with 100% sensitivity (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively). The sensitivity of duplex ultrasound in predicting a small internal carotid artery diameter was 80%. The specificity of duplex ultrasound for predicting excessive distal extent of plaque, small internal carotid artery diameter, high carotid bifurcation, and a coiled or kinked carotid artery was 92%, 56%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.\nDuplex ultrasound can predict the presence of anatomic features that may complicate carotid endarterectomy.

Restenoses necessitating a redo CEA were also higher for PC (11%) than for PTFE-P (1%) and VPC (2%) (p < 0.001). Women with PC had a higher recurrent stenosis rate than men (46% vs 23%, p = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that freedom from recurrent stenosis at 48 months was 47% for PC, 84% for VPC, and 96% for PTFE-P (p < 0.001). The SVP and JVP results were comparable. The mean operative diameter of the internal carotid artery was similar in patients with or without restenosis. Significantly more late internal carotid artery dilatations occurred in the VPC group compared with the PC group.\nPatch closure (VPC or PTFE-P) is less likely than PC to cause perioperative stroke.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treated concurrently by open operation and endoluminal intervention by the same surgeons during a defined interval.\nBetween May 1992 and May 1996, 362 consecutive patients with AAA underwent repair. Fifty-three patients who underwent open operations for ruptured AAA plus two patients who underwent endoluminal repair of false AAA and four patients who underwent secondary endoluminal repair of AAA were excluded, leaving 303 patients who underwent elective repair of true AAA in the study. The elective operations were conventional open repair (OR) in 195 patients (151 men, 44 women; mean age, 69 years) and endoluminal repair (ER) in 108 patients (100 men, 8 women; mean age, 70 years). The decision to perform ERwas based on comorbidities that precluded open repair (n = 48) and patient choice (n = 60). Graft configuration in the open repair group was tubular (n = 180) and bifurcated (n = 15), and in the ER group tubular (n = 48), aortoiliac/femoral (n = 25), and bifurcated (n = 35). All procedures were performed in the operating department, and radiographic guidance was used in the ER group. Follow-up was by interview, examination, and telephone. In addition, contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed within the first 10 days after operation, 6 months and 12 months after operation, and then annually thereafter in the ER group. Outcome measures were successful exclusion of the aneurysm sac from the general circulation and survival. Data were analyzed by the life table method. Other outcome measures were length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, and operative blood loss.\nNo significant difference was found between the perioperative mortality rate for OR (11 deaths [5.6%] in 195 patients) and ER (six deaths [5.6%] in 108 patients). Three of the six deaths in the latter group occurred in patients with successful ER, and three occurred in 18 patients with failed ER who were converted to OR. Similarly, no significant difference was seen in the survival rate between the endoluminal and open repair groups when analyzed by the log-rank test (p = 0.14). The rate of graft failure, however, was significantly higher in the ER group than in the OR group (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). Success in the ER group was defined as continuing graft function without endoleak or conversion to open repair. Kaplan-Meier curve for graft failure times for the endoluminal group revealed a 3-year graft success probability of 70%.\nThis study suggests that ER is safe, sharing the same perioperative mortality risk as OR despite 44% of the ER group being rejected as unfit for OR. Conventional open repair is the most reliable method of successfully managing AAA. The endoluminal method, however, results in shorter length of hospital stay, shorter length of intensive care unit stay, and less blood loss than the open method. Patients who opt for the endoluminal method of repair should be made aware that the minimally invasive technique carries the disadvantage of a higher failure rate.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the routine use of pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) in patients who undergo aortic surgery.\nOne hundred twenty patients were randomized to placement of PACs for perioperative monitoring and hemodynamic optimization (tune up) in the intensive care unit on the night before aortic operation, or to intravenous hydration in the ward and perioperative monitoring without PACs. Before randomization, all patients underwent routine adenosine thallium-201 scintigraphy.\nTo meet predetermined endpoints, 30 PAC patients (50%) received nitrates, inotropic agents, or both. PAC patients received more fluid in the preoperative period (p < 0.001) and in the first 24 hours after operation (p = 0.002) than control subjects. Eleven PAC patients (18%) and three control subjects (5%) had adverse intraoperative events (p = 0.02). There were 20 adverse postoperative events in 15 PAC patients (25%; nine cardiac, seven pulmonary, four acute tubular necrosis), which was not different compared with 11 postoperative events in 10 control subjects (17%; five cardiac, five pulmonary, one acute tubular necrosis). There were also no differences in duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, or hospital stay between groups. Postoperative cardiac complications were more common among patients who had a history of congestive heart failure (p = 0.02; odds ratio, 3.75; confidence interval, 1.3 to 11) or reperfusion defects on adenosine thallium scintigraphy (p = 0.01; odds ratio, 3.4; confidence interval, 1.2 to 9.4), regardless of group.\nRoutine use of PACs for perioperative monitoring with the above protocol during aortic surgery is not beneficial and may be associated with a higher rate of intraoperative complications. Preoperative tune up does not prevent postoperative cardiac, renal, and other complications. Variables such as cardiac risk factors and adenosine thallium scintigraphy may be more important predictors of cardiac events in patients who undergo aortic operations.",

    "abstract": "To identify the predictive risk factors for rupture of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAA).\nThirty-one patients with TAA who did not have the indications for surgical repair of the aneurysm were selected. Inclusion criteria were maximum diameter less than 60 mm, refusal of surgical treatment, and high surgical risk. The selected patients participated in a prospective follow-up study for a median period of 47 months and underwent at least two thoracoabdominal computed tomographic scans a year to measure transverse and anteroposterior diameters. Identification of the predictive factors associated with rupture was undertaken with multivariate analysis by means of Cox regression model.\nDuring the study period five patients underwent elective repair, six died of unrelated causes, nine had aneurysms that ruptured (all with diameters greater than 50 mm), and 11 reached the end of the study without rupture or surgical management. Initial anteroposterior diameter and annual growth rate of the anteroposterior diameter were the variables associated with rupture of the TAA according to the multivariate statistical analysis by means of Cox regression model.\nWe recommend elective repair for a fit patient with asymptomatic TAA with an initial anteroposterior diameter of 50 mm only when there is an annual growth rate of at least 10 mm. Patients with similar diameters but with smaller annual growth rates should be treated conservatively and undergo thoracoabdominal computed tomography every 6 months. Patients with an initial anteroposterior diameter of 60 mm and an annual growth rate of 6 mm should undergo surgical treatment. These guidelines for elective repair of TAA are based on the results of a relatively small series and have to be carefully individualized for each patient.",

    "abstract": "A new technique extending the incision used for thoracic outlet decompression with a subclavicular approach to the first rib is presented. After the first rib and scalenotomy are removed, the subclavicular incision is continued into the sternum medially and superiorly to the sternal notch. This gives easy access to the innominate-subclavian-axillary vein segment. Eight patients with extensive chronic fibrotic obstruction of the subclavian-innominate vein segment underwent operation with this technique. It allows placement of either long patches of saphenous vein to reestablish normal caliber or replacement, as is our choice, with a small-sized cryopreserved descending thoracic aortic homograft. The operation is carried out in an extrapleural plane preserving the sternoclavicular joint, avoiding the deformity caused by transclavicular techniques. Repair of the sternotomy creates a stable incision. Follow-up to 14 months shows patency of the venous channel with no complications. This surgical approach is recommended to solve the problem of satisfactory exposure of the subclavian-innominate venous channel after decompression of the thoracic outlet.",

    "abstract": "Primary tumors of the aorta are rare and are difficult to diagnose preoperatively. These tumors are malignant and ultimately fatal. A patient had initial evidence of aortoiliac obstructive disease. Aortic endarterectomy produced an excellent postoperative clinical result until the pathology report from the endarterectomy specimen revealed aortic sarcoma. The patient refused a second operation for en bloc aortic resection. One year later with recurrent symptoms, the patient underwent en bloc resection of the aorta and common iliac vessels until clear margins were obtained. The tumor was found to be intimal aortic sarcoma of endothelial cell origin. The only metastasis was to bone, and it was controlled with radiation and chemotherapy. The patient lived a total of 8 years from the time of initial diagnosis. Abdominal aortic intimal sarcoma of the endothelial cell type is a rare variety of aortic sarcoma that can be managed successfully if diagnosed early. This specific type of tumor has a longer survival period and better prognosis than other types of aortic sarcoma when managed with aggressive surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Cryopreserved human blood vessels are important tools in bypass surgery. However, several in vitro studies have demonstrated diminished postthaw functional activity. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of various freezing/thawing protocols and the role of protein kinase C in the postthaw functional activity of cryopreserved human arteries.\nIn vitro responses of frozen/thawed human internal mammary arteries (IMA) were used to investigate the functional activity after thawing at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 100 degrees C/min and after different prefreezing equilibration times (10, 60, 120, 240 minutes) with the cryomedium (Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 1.8 mol/L dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.1 mol/L sucrose) at room temperature followed by cryostorage at -196 degrees C.\nPrefreezing equilibration for 10 to 120 minutes diminished maximal alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses to noradrenaline to approximately 60%, and equilibration for 240 minutes attenuated noradrenaline effects to less than 25% of that produced by unfrozen controls. Contractile responses were slightly better when thawing was performed at 15 degrees C/min compared with 100 degrees C/min. The postthaw sensitivity to direct activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was enhanced. Compared with unfrozen tissues (pD2 = 7.36 +/- 0.07, n = 32) maximal sensitization to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was observed in IMA that had been frozen after 60 minutes of equilibration with the cryomedium (pD2 = 8.31 +/- 0.09, n = 30). Responses to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate of cryopreserved IMA were highly susceptible to blockade of calcium influx by nifedipine, whereas those of unfrozen IMA were resistant to nifedipine. Against noradrenaline nifedipine was equipotent in cryopreserved (pD'2 = 7.75 +/- 0.15, n = 8) and unfrozen IMA (pD'2 = 7.70 +/- 0.10, n = 6). Endothelium-dependent relaxant responses to acetylcholine were significantly attenuated after cryopreservation (Emax = 26% +/- 5%, n = 4) compared with unfrozen IMA (Emax = 71% +/- 4%, n = 4, p < 0.001); endothelium-independent relaxant responses to sodium nitroprusside were unchanged.\nCryopreservation of human IMA under the conditions applied in this study (1) attenuated endothelial cell function and (2) induced an activation of protein kinase C, thereby increasing calcium influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. These experimental data suggest that postoperative administration of calcium channel blockers alone or combined with long-acting nitrates should effectively prevent the development of spasms in arterial grafts.",

    "abstract": "Although saphenous vein is the most reliable conduit for arterial interposition procedures in the coronary circulation, graft thrombosis remains a clinical problem. We hypothesized that an important factor in early graft thrombosis is sudden change in the hemodynamic environment of the vein as it is placed in the coronary circulation.\nWe used an ex vivo perfusion system to study freshly excised segments of human saphenous vein (HSV) and pig internal jugular vein. For coronary graft (CAVG) simulation, sections of HSV were subjected to arterial pulsatile pressure and flow and twisting and stretching to mimic deformations caused by the beating heart. Using functional and immunohistochemical assays, we investigated the effect of these conditions on expression of tissue factor (TF), an important prothrombotic surface molecule.\nIn each of 11 experiments (6 human, 5 porcine), vein segments from a single donor were subjected to venous conditions (VEN), CAVG perfusion, or no perfusion. Expression of TF was measured as the amount of factor Xa generated per unit area of luminal vein surface. VEN perfusion did not cause a significant change in mean TF expression over nonperfused control values (human: 14.3 +/- 1.5 versus 11.4 +/- 2.3 U/cm2, p = 0.31; pig: 11.6 +/- 1.5 versus 12.5 +/- 1.4 U/cm2, p = 0.70). CAVG perfusion led to significant enhancement of TF expression over VEN perfusion (human: 36.8 +/- 6.2 versus 14.3 +/- 1.5 U/cm2, p < 0.05; pig: 40.0 +/- 9.9 versus 11.6 +/- 1.5 U/cm2, p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive TF staining on the luminal side of a CAVG-stimulated HSV segment, but not on a VEN-stimulated segment. In four additional studies, HSV segments were subjected to arterial perfusion without twist and stretch to mimic lower extremity arterial interposition grafts. TF expression for lower extremity venous graft perfusion was significantly higher than for VEN perfusion (25.3 +/- 2.5 versus 14.3 +/- 1.5, p < 0.01) but not significantly different from CAVG perfusion.\nOur studies in a unique perfusion system suggest that exposure of vein to coronary arterial hemodynamic conditions results in elevated expression of the important prothrombotic molecule TF. This phenomenon may contribute to early graft thrombosis.",

VEN perfusion did not cause a significant change in mean TF expression over nonperfused control values (human: 14.3 +/- 1.5 versus 11.4 +/- 2.3 U/cm2, p = 0.31; pig: 11.6 +/- 1.5 versus 12.5 +/- 1.4 U/cm2, p = 0.70). CAVG perfusion led to significant enhancement of TF expression over VEN perfusion (human: 36.8 +/- 6.2 versus 14.3 +/- 1.5 U/cm2, p < 0.05; pig: 40.0 +/- 9.9 versus 11.6 +/- 1.5 U/cm2, p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive TF staining on the luminal side of a CAVG-stimulated HSV segment, but not on a VEN-stimulated segment. In four additional studies, HSV segments were subjected to arterial perfusion without twist and stretch to mimic lower extremity arterial interposition grafts. TF expression for lower extremity venous graft perfusion was significantly higher than for VEN perfusion (25.3 +/- 2.5 versus 14.3 +/- 1.5, p < 0.01) but not significantly different from CAVG perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell proliferation is a key event in the development of intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. Heparin can suppress smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro and prevents intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury, but the mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Recently, we observed that heparin inhibited serum-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in smooth muscle cells, but heparin did not inhibit signaling induced by platelet-derived growth factor BB and basic fibroblast growth factor, both ligands of tyrosine kinase receptors. Here, we examined the possibility that heparin inhibits signaling by thrombin and other activators of heterotrimeric G-proteins.\nBaboon aortic smooth muscle cells were stimulated with thrombin, angiotensin II, endothelin-1, and lysophosphatidic acid in the presence or absence of heparin. After stimulation, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was measured with an in-gel phosphorylation assay, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 was immunoprecipitated from the same samples, and activity was measured with recombinant mitogen-activated protein kinase as a substrate. DNA synthesis was measured by 3H-thymidine labeling and scintillation counting.\nHeparin inhibited sustained activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase and prevented DNA synthesis induced by thrombin, angiotensin II, endothelin-1, and lysophosphatidic acid.\nHeparin inhibits growth of baboon smooth muscle cells by preventing prolonged mitogen-activated protein kinase activation elicited by ligands of seven transmembrane domain receptors and heterotrimeric G-proteins. The results indicate that heparin interferes with a specific pathway in smooth muscle cell growth, which could be a future target in attempts to inhibit lesion development after vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "To perform an in vitro evaluation of electrostatic endothelial cell transplantation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) onto segments of 4 mm internal diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular prostheses.\nThis evaluation consisted of exposing vascular graft segments that had been subjected to either electrostatic or gravitation transplantation with HUVEC to a physiologic shear stress (15 dynes/cm2) under steady flow conditions within a flow loop system. Biochemical assays were performed on freshly transplanted grafts by means of radioimmunoassay for prostacyclin and thromboxane A2.\nThere was a 30% loss of HUVEC after 30 minutes of shear stress exposure from the grafts subjected to gravitational transplantation with no additional significant (alpha = 0.05) loss after 120 minutes. Grafts subjected to electrostatic transplantation had no significant (alpha = 0.05) loss of HUVEC during exposure to physiologic shear stress. Furthermore, after 120 minutes of shear-stress exposure, the grafts subjected to electrostatic transplantation (78,420 +/- 6274 HUVEC/cm2) retained 2.3 times more HUVEC than the counterparts subjected to gravitational transplantation (34,427 +/- 4637 HUVEC/cm2). The biochemical assay results indicated no significant (alpha = 0.05) production of prostacyclin or thromboxane A2 regardless of the method of cell transplantation.\n(1) The electrostatic transplantation technique was superior to the gravitational transplantation technique in terms of cellular retention when the ePTFE grafts were exposed to physiologic shear stress.

    "abstract": "Although it has been claimed that allografts of blood vessels might be successful because of minimal immunogenicity, they are subject to frequent and early failure, the cause of which has not been thoroughly investigated. We sought to define the immune response to allograft bypass. In a prospective trial, 40 patients underwent cryopreserved venous allograft bypass. Allograft biopsies were performed at implantation and at allograft explantation in instances of graft failure. Tissues were evaluated in a blinded manner by means of standard histologic examination and paraffin immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies against a variety of immune markers. During the 31-month follow-up period, 22 allografts were removed, and 19 were suitable for immunohistochemical study. Of these 19, 6 (32%) had moderate or severe infiltrates, which were evenly distributed throughout the intima, media, and adventitia. Immunohistochemical study of the explants demonstrated all of these infiltrates to be leukocytes (+LCA), which were predominantly activated T lymphocytes (+CD3, CD8, CR3) containing cytotoxic granules (+TIA-1). Macrophages were uncommon (+CD68); B cells (+L26, CD79) and natural killer cells (+CD56) were rare. Immunosuppression was associated with decreased presence of cytotoxic granules (TIA-1). Human venous allografts are immunogenic and prompt a T cell-mediated response. Allografts also fail without strong evidence of rejection, presumably because of local injury, hypercoagulability, or stasis. It may be possible to modify the contribution of rejection to venous allograft failure by means of immunosuppression and to modify the contribution of local hypercoagulability by means of anticoagulation.",

To define reflux, reversed flow in 31 healthy persons was measured.\nIn a review of all veins of the 72 patients, 8 patients (11%) had completely normal duplex results in all veins, 33 (46%) had reflux, 6 (8%) had at least one noncompressible vein segment, and 25 (35%) had a combination of both.

Flow was present in 99% of the 611 previously thrombosed proximal and distal segments.\nMost patients with deep venous thrombosis still had venous abnormalities 7 to 13 years after the initial diagnosis. The most common abnormality was reflux. Significantly more abnormalities were found in initially thrombosed segments. The abnormalities were found in the proximal vein segments and in the distal vein segments, although less frequently in the latter.",

    "abstract": "To develop an ex vivo human carotid artery stenting model that can be used for the quantitative analysis of risk for embolization associated with balloon angioplasty and stenting and to correlate this risk with lesion characteristics to define lesions suitable for balloon angioplasty and stenting.\nSpecimens of carotid plaque (n = 24) were obtained circumferentially intact from patients undergoing standard carotid endarterectomy. Carotid lesions were prospectively characterized on the basis of angiographic and duplex findings before endarterectomy and clinical findings. Specimens were encased in a polytetrafluoroethylene wrap and mounted in a flow chamber that allowed access for endovascular procedures and observations. Balloon angioplasty and stenting were performed under fluoroscopic guidance with either a Palmaz stent or a Wallstent endoprosthesis. Ex vivo angiograms were obtained before and after intervention. Effluent from each specimen was filtered for released embolic particles, which were microscopically examined, counted, and correlated with various plaque characteristics by means of multivariate analysis.\nBalloon angioplasty and stenting produced embolic particles that consisted of atherosclerotic debris, organized thrombus, and calcified material. The number of embolic particles detected after balloon angioplasty and stenting was not related to preoperative symptoms, sex, plaque ulceration or calcification, or artery size. However, echolucent plaques generated a higher number of particles compared with echogenic plaques (p < 0.01). In addition, increased lesion stenosis also significantly correlated with the total number of particles produced by balloon angioplasty and stenting (r = 0.55). Multivariate analysis revealed that these two characteristics were independent risk factors.\nEcholucent plaques and plaques with stenosis > or = 90% produced a higher number of embolic particles and therefore may be less suitable for balloon angioplasty and stenting. This ex vivo model can be used to identify high-risk lesions for balloon angioplasty and stenting and can aid in the evaluation of new devices being considered for carotid balloon angioplasty and stenting.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relation between endoleaks and intraaneurysmal pressure (IAP) and the effect of coil embolization in the management of endoleaks.\nThe infrarenal aorta of a dog (n = 15) was replaced by a polytetrafluoroethylene aneurysm containing a pressure transducer. Group I (n = 4) had untreated aneurysms. Group II (n = 4) had endovascularly excluded aneurysms without an endoleak. Group III (n = 7) had aneurysms excluded by means of grafts with a defect that represented the source of an endoleak. After 4 weeks of follow-up study, the endoleaks in group III dogs were subjected to coil embolization. Systolic IAP was measured daily and expressed as a ratio of systolic blood pressure obtained from a forelimb cuff. Arteriography, duplex ultrasonography, and spiral contrast computed tomography were performed to evaluate endoleaks.\nIn group I, the LAP remained close to systolic blood pressure (ratio of 0.96 +/- 0.06), whereas in group II the IAP ratio showed a decline to 0.34 +/- 0.16 (p = 0.0009 group I versus II). After an initial decrease, the IAP ratio in group III stabilized at 0.75 +/- 0.18 (p = 0.003, group II versus III). Aneurysms with an endoleak remained pulsatile with a pulse pressure of 30 +/- 16 mm Hg, which was less than that of untreated aneurysms (62 +/- 15 mm Hg; p < 0.0001 group I versus III). Arteriography and computed tomography revealed \"sealing\" of endoleaks after coil embolization, but IAP ratio did not decrease (0.76 +/- 0.14) after coil embolization.\nIncomplete endovascular aneurysm exclusion caused by an endoleak fails to reduce IAP ratio and may subject the aneurysm to a continued risk for rupture. Although coil embolization resulted in angiographic and computed tomographic sealing, it failed to reduce IAP ratio.",

A total of 47 men and 27 women with a median age of 73 years (range, 52 to 86 years) were evaluated.\nCT and operative findings were compared.\nCT correctly diagnosed rupture in 22 of 28 patients who underwent operation and correctly excluded rupture in 30 of 39 patients who underwent operation. The sensitivity and specificity of CT when compared with operative findings were therefore 79% and 77%, respectively.\nThese data indicate that CT has little additional diagnostic value. If in the opinion of an experienced vascular surgeon rupture cannot be excluded on clinical grounds alone, and the patient has no medical contraindications to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, then the patient should be taken directly to the operating department.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to obtain health values from patients with intermittent claudication with five different instruments and to study the construct validity of these measures of health-related quality of life by examining their relation with symptom severity.\nWe included all patients with intermittent claudication who participated in an exercise program of the Department of Internal Medicine at our university hospital (n = 92). Health value instruments included the verbal rating scale, time trade-off, standard gamble, EuroQol, and the Health Utilities Index (Mark III). Symptom-free walking distance was used as a measure of symptom severity.\nFor all instruments the average health values in groups of patients with a symptom-free walking distance < or = 150 m were lower than the average values in patients with a greater walk distance, but the differences for the time trade-off and the standard gamble were small, and only the differences for the verbal rating scale and the EuroQol were statistically significant. At the individual patient level considerable heterogeneity was seen, and the statistical association of the symptom-free walking distance with health values varied from poor to moderate (Spearman rank correlations, 0.03 to 0.48; p values, 0.003 to 0.78).\nAt least for the verbal rating scale and the EuroQol, the results of our study provide evidence of the validity of the various health value instruments in a population of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.",

The annual incidence rate of contralateral critical ischemia and claudication combined varied from 7.7% to 21.3%. Cox regression analysis indicated that the initial ipsilateral symptoms and the initial contralateral ankle/brachial index can be used to predict the occurrence of contralateral symptoms.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of color-flow duplex surveillance parameters to detect infrainguinal vein graft stenoses and to investigate whether graft revision without angiography is justified.\nIn a prospective study in which three centers participated, the data of graft surveillance in 300 patients were analyzed. For the evaluation of surveillance criteria all patients underwent a digital subtraction angiography if a graft stenosis was suspected. To create a control group, in patients with normal grafts a consented digital subtraction angiography was performed also. From these data the accuracy of seven duplex and three ankle blood pressure-derived variables was assessed. The relation between various surveillance criteria and continued graft patency was determined with life table analysis with the transient state method.\nThe mean follow-up period was 20 months (range, 1 to 40 months). At univariate and multivariate analysis the peak systolic velocity (PSV) ratio provided the best correlation with angiographic stenoses > or = 70% (PSV ratio cutoff 3.0: sensitivity 80%, specificity 84%). This finding did not differ between the participating centers. With life table methods it was demonstrated that the best combination of efficacy (limitation of the number of unnecessary revisions), safety (minimal number of correctable lesions missed), and reduction of angiograms was obtained by a two-parameter surveillance algorithm. This algorithm included a PSV ratio < 2.5 to delineate patients in whom a conservative approach without angiography or revision was appropriate, a PSV ratio > or = 4.0 to indicate patients in whom vein graft revision without angiography could be scheduled, and a group with PSV ratios between 2.5 and 4.0 in whom angiography was to be performed to determine clinical management on the basis of the stenosis severity. This algorithm had a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 89%. In addition, it resulted in a reduction of the number of angiograms of 49% compared with a policy of angiographies in all patients with a PSV ratio > or = 2.5.\nThe best criterion to identify a failing graft is the PSV ratio. With a two-parameter algorithm for vein graft surveillance, the incidence of unnecessary revisions and of missed high-grade lesions was acceptably low, whereas the number of angiograms was reduced by one half.",

    "abstract": "When operating on abdominal aortic aneurysms associated with stenoses or occlusions of iliac vessels, surgeons may face the problem of reestablishing circulation to pelvic or gluteal territories. A new technique consists of anastomosing a posterior opening in the body or one of the branches of a bifurcated graft, distally sutured to the femoral artery, to the distal aortic stump, which contains all the patent vessels arising from the end of the aorta, such as inferior mesenteric and lumbar arteries. This technique, successfully performed in two cases, has the advantages of avoiding closure of the distal aortic stump and a possible backflow leak and of ensuring adequate pelvic circulation.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery is the most common abnormality of the aortic arch vessels and occurs in approximately 0.5% to 1% of the population. Symptoms can result from compression of the esophagus by the aberrant vessel, aneurysm formation, or atherosclerotic occlusion. Occlusive symptoms are typically relieved by surgical revascularization (i.e., transposition or carotid-subclavian bypass) through a cervical approach. An alternative approach to the management of stenosis of normal subclavian arteries is percutaneous angioplasty and stenting, an approach not previously used for occlusive disease of an aberrant right subclavian artery. We describe a case of focal stenosis of an aberrant right subclavian artery causing dizziness and arm claudication in a patient who underwent successful percutaneous angioplasty and stenting.",

    "abstract": "A technique to decrease visceral ischemic time during thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair is reported.\nA 10 mm Dacron side-arm graft is attached to the aortic prosthesis and positioned immediately distal to the planned proximal thoracic aortic anastomosis. On completion of the anastomosis, a 16 to 22 Fr perfusion catheter is attached to the side-arm graft and inserted into the orifice of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. The cross-clamp is then placed on the aortic graft distal to the mesenteric side-arm graft. Pulsatile arterial perfusion is thus established to the visceral circulation while intercostal anastomoses or reconstruction of celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries is performed. Visceral ischemic time and the rise in end-tidal Pco2 after reconstruction of the visceral vessels in patients with mesenteric shunting was compared with a control group matched for aneurysm extent and treated immediately before use of the mesenteric shunt technique.\nBetween July and Oct, 1996, the technique was applied in 15 patients undergoing type I, II, or III TAA repair with a clamp and sew technique. The mean decrease in systolic arterial pressure was 12.5 +/- 8.5 mm Hg, with a concomitant rise in end-tidal Pco2 (mean, 6.9 +/- 5.8 mm Hg), after perfusion was established through the mesenteric shunt. Mean time to establishment of visceral perfusion through the shunt was 25.5 +/- 4.4 minutes; the resultant decrement in visceral ischemic time averaged 31.3 minutes (i.e., until celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries were reconstructed). Compared with controls, patients with shunts had a significantly decreased (6.9 +/- 5.8 versus 21.6 +/- 8.4 mm Hg; p = 0.0003) rise in end-tidal CO2 on completion of visceral vessel reconstruction.\nIn-line mesenteric shunting is a simple method to decrease visceral ischemia during TAA repair, and it is adaptable to clamp and sew or partial bypass and distal perfusion operative techniques.",

The primary tumors of two were intravenous leiomyomatoses originating from the uterus; a third patient had invasive thymoma, and the fourth patient had clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. In 1985, one patient had a curative, staged resection. One-stage operations were carried out in three patients, and all intracardiac tumors were successfully resected en bloc with the primary tumors under conditions of electrical ventricular fibrillation and mild hypothermia. Combined venous reconstructions were necessary for en bloc resection in three cases. Two patients with malignancy received postoperative chemoradiotherapy, and all four patients were discharged uneventfully from our hospital. We consider radical resection with curative intent only for patients with tumors extending into the heart. In these cases, a one-stage operation is preferable, and electrical ventricular fibrillation with mild hypothermia is a recommended method of circulatory assist because of its simplicity.",

The expression of two genes, BCL2, which inhibits apoptosis, and BAX, which induces apoptosis, was examined and correlated to the presence of risk factors that included hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.\nBAX expression was found in 26 of 86 cases (30%), and no immunoreactivity was found in the normal carotid specimens. BCL2 expression was not seen in any examined tissues (atherosclerotic or normal carotid arteries). Of the 26 patients who expressed the BAX gene, 22 were hypertensive (85%), and hypertension (>160/95 mm Hg) was present in 25 of 60 patients (41%) who did not express the BAX gene (p < 0.01). No significant correlation was found between the expression of the BAX gene and other risk factors (smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus) or presenting symptoms.\nIn a significant number of stenosed carotid arteries (30%), we found no evidence of apoptosis suggested by the presence of BAX expression. Hypertension was more prevalent in those patients with BAX gene expression than in those patients without BAX gene expression. BCL2 expression, which inhibits apoptosis, was not found. Further study of this phenomenon may contribute to the discovery of new treatments for atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) at the arterial wall is increased subsequent to the abrupt elevation of blood flow in resistance arteries.\nEight dogs underwent laparotomy with anesthesia, and their small bowels were exteriorized. NO concentration was measured with NO-specific electrodes (200-micro-tip diameter) at the outer wall of the mesenteric arteries. Flow was increased by occlusion of the adjacent mesenteric arteries. In four animals, flow and NO concentration were measured after the administration of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) to inhibit NO production.\nAs arterial flow was increased from a baseline of 5.4 +/- 1.3 ml/min to 10.9 +/- 1.8 ml/min (p = 0.001), NO electrode current was elevated in every animal. With repetition of the flow stimulus, the response tended to be attenuated. In the first experimental trial, NO electrode current measured at the arterial wall increased from 2.86 +/- 0.56 to 3.00 +/- 0.60 nA (p = 0.02). L-NAME (10 mg/kg intravenous) effectively inhibited NO synthase as indicated by the elevation of mean arterial pressure (11 +/- 1.7 mm Hg; p = 0.04). After administration of L-NAME, NO electrode current measured at the outer arterial wall fell 0.23 +/- 0.05 nA (p = 0.02).\nThe data indicate that a doubling of blood flow in the canine mesenteric resistance arteries is associated with an increase in NO concentration of at least 100 nm at the outer arterial wall. This association is probably a substantial underestimation of the actual concentration because of the geometry of the electrode tip. To our knowledge, ours is the first report of direct in vivo measurement of flow-dependent NO release in resistance arteries.",

In the first experimental trial, NO electrode current measured at the arterial wall increased from 2.86 +/- 0.56 to 3.00 +/- 0.60 nA (p = 0.02). L-NAME (10 mg/kg intravenous) effectively inhibited NO synthase as indicated by the elevation of mean arterial pressure (11 +/- 1.7 mm Hg; p = 0.04). After administration of L-NAME, NO electrode current measured at the outer arterial wall fell 0.23 +/- 0.05 nA (p = 0.02).",

    "abstract": "This investigation was designed to evaluate the mechanism used to acquire a tolerance to spinal ischemia. We investigated inductions of the heat shock protein (HSP) 70 gene and protein in rabbit spinal cord with or without preconditioning.\nNeurologic function, morphologic changes, and inductions of HSP70 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were compared in the cases of a 15-minute ischemia 2 days after sham treatment and a 15-minute ischemia 2 days after 10-minute preconditioning.\nHSP70 mRNA was induced at 8 hours of reperfusion after a 15-minute ischemia 2 days after sham treatment. HSP70 protein was induced slightly in selective motor neuron cells at 8 hours of reperfusion, and about 70% of motor neuron cells showed selective cell death after 7 days of reperfusion (p < 0.01). On the other hand, large populations of the motor neuron cells survived at 7 days after the 15-minute ischemia that was applied at 2 days after preconditioning (p < 0.01). HSP70 mRNA was induced persistently as compared with the case of a 15-minute ischemia 2 days after sham treatment. The motor neuron cells strongly produced immunoreactive HSP70 from 8 hours to 2 days.\nPreconditioning with 10-minute ischemia enhanced and prolonged the HSP70 gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels and saved the motor neuron cells from subsequent lethal ischemia. These changes of HSP70 gene expression may play an important role in the acquisition of ischemic tolerance of motor neuron cells in rabbit spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Near-infrared Raman spectroscopy provides an important new means of analyzing the chemical composition of the arterial wall. The objective of this study was to show that Raman spectroscopy can be used to evaluate the lipid and calcium salt contents of human peripheral arteries. The results extend a recently developed Raman-based method for analyzing the chemical composition of coronary arteries.\nWe studied 167 segments of carotid and femoral artery wall in various pathologic states. The Raman spectra from these samples was accurately modeled. The resulting chemical concentrations were compared with the amounts of cholesterol and calcium mineral determined at histologic evaluation by an experienced cardiovascular pathologist. Strong correlations between spectroscopic measurements and morphologic findings were demonstrated and validated the applicability of the method to peripheral arteries.\nRaman spectroscopy can provide reliable histochemical information about peripheral and coronary arteries. Such information may help identify rupture-prone plaques before the onset of symptoms and allow aggressive and directed intervention. Accurate knowledge of the chemical composition of a lesion may be useful in selecting the most appropriate treatment.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, and transgene expression from adenovirus vectors can provide in vivo delivery of proteins. On the basis of this knowledge, we hypothesized that local administration of a replication-deficient adenovirus vector expressing complementary DNA for VEGF (AdVEGF) would induce collateral vessel formation in the setting of ischemia that could protect against subsequent acute vascular occlusion.\nHindlimb ischemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by means of unilateral ligation of the common iliac artery immediately followed by administration of 4 x 10(9)-plaque-forming units VEGF, the control vector AdNull, or phosphate-buffered saline solution into the iliofemoral adipose tissue and thigh muscles. Untreated rats with common iliac ligation were used as an additional control group.\nLocal VEGF expression was observed for 5 days in AdVEGF-treated rats but not in controls. Three weeks after ligation and vector administration, the ipsilateral femoral artery was ligated for a model of an acute vascular occlusion in the setting of preexisting ischemia. Blood flow to the ischemic hindlimb relative to the contralateral hindlimb evaluated with color microspheres demonstrated significantly increased blood flow in the AdVEGF-treated rats compared with each control group (p < 0.0001). Relative blood flow assessed by means of 99mTc-sestamibi radionuclide scans also demonstrated increased blood flow to the ligated hindlimb of AdVEGF-treated rats compared with each control group (p < 0.002). AdVEGF-treated rats also demonstrated increased vascularity in the ligated limb compared with each control group as assessed by means of angiography (p < 0.0001) and histologic quantification of blood vessels less than 80 microm diameter in local adipose tissue and capillaries per muscle fiber (p < 0.0002). AdVEGF treatment prevented a rise in femoral venous lactate femoral venous concentrations 1 hour after femoral artery ligation in control rats (p < 0.04).\nAn adenovirus vector expressing VEGF complementary DNA is capable of stimulating an angiogenic response that protects against acute vascular occlusion in the setting of preexisting ischemia, suggesting that in vivo gene transfer of VEGF complementary DNA might be useful in prophylaxis of advancing arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to prove the efficacy of cryopreserved aortic allografts to treat an established vascular graft infection by in situ replacement in an animal model and to evaluate the role of the antibiotics normally used to decontaminate the allografts.\nTwenty-three dogs underwent infrarenal aortic replacement with a gelatin-sealed knitted polyester graft contaminated in vitro by Staphylococcus epidermidis RP-62. One week later, the 18 surviving animals underwent reoperation for graft removal and were randomized into three groups for in situ replacement: group I (control, n = 6) received a new gelatin-sealed graft; group II (n = 6) received a non-antibiotic-treated cryopreserved allograft; and group III (n = 6) received an antibiotic-treated cryopreserved allograft. Control grafts and allografts were removed 4 weeks after the initial intervention for quantitative bacteriologic analysis and histologic analysis. Bacteriologic results were expressed as colony-forming units per square centimeter of graft material. Qualitative bacteriologic analysis was also obtained from perigraft fluid and tissue.\nAll of the initially implanted grafts and all of the control grafts (group I) were infected at the time of removal. In group II, three out of six allografts were not totally incorporated, whereas in group III incorporation was always complete, with a significantly decreased inflammatory reaction. All of the antibiotic-treated allografts were sterile, whereas three untreated allografts grew bacteria.\nIn this model, cryopreserved aortic allografts were more resistant to reinfection than synthetic grafts after in situ replacement of an infected prosthetic graft. However, the antibiotic loading of the cryopreserved aortic allograft appears to be essential to obtain optimal therapeutic effects.",

    "abstract": "The study was done to improve quantification of multiple arterial stenoses and to investigate a new imaging technique for lower limb arteries. Three-dimensional power Doppler angiography was used to quantify in vitro arterial stenoses.\nWe built two types of artery phantoms containing multiple stenoses. One used stenotic porcine arteries, and the other was designed to control the proximal and distal stenoses while we assessed central stenosis of a wall-less agar lumen. Three-dimensional power Doppler angiograms of the flow lumens were generated at different flow rates under steady and pulsatile flow conditions with a PowerPC 8500 computer-based three-dimensional ultrasound imaging system. This experimental system works off-line, performs three-dimensional acquisition, reconstruction, and display of ultrasound images. Images of flow lumens were compared with the measured B-mode images or the true geometry.\nThis technique produces good three-dimensional angiographic images of the flow lumen, and multiple stenoses do not affect the diagnosis of arterial stenoses. With this technique, the average errors for estimating 80% and 50% area reduction stenoses were -10% and 4%, respectively.\nThree-dimensional power Doppler angiography has the potential to quantitatively grade multisegmental stenoses in lower limbs and generate a map for vasculature surgery planning.",

    "abstract": "The association between deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the hypercoagulable state is a well-established entity. However, the association between saphenous vein thrombophlebitis and coagulation abnormalities has not been investigated. Although thrombosis of varicose veins typically runs a benign course, phlebitis of the saphenous system may propagate to the deep system or saphenofemoral junction that requires more aggressive therapy. Given the potential similarity in clinical outcome between saphenous vein thrombophlebitis (SVT) and DVT, we have investigated the coagulation profile of patients presenting with isolated SVT.\nSeventeen consecutive patients who presented to our vascular laboratory with isolated SVT had a coagulation profile performed that included antithrombin III (AT III), protein C (PC), protein S (PS) antigen and activity levels, activated protein C (APC) resistance, factor V DNA mutation, and coagulation factors II and X. All patients had duplex scans performed on both the superficial and deep venous systems. Patients with SVT only were treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and warm soaks as outpatients, whereas those patients found to have DVT or a clot at the saphenofemoral junction were fully anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin therapy. All 17 patients had at least one repeat coagulation profile performed up to 5 months after their SVT occurrence to ensure that the results of hypercoagulability were not transient.\nTen (59%) of the 17 patients with SVT had abnormal coagulation profiles on initial presentation. All 10 patients who were hypercoagulable had repeat tests and 6 (35%) remained abnormal. Four patients who had abnormal results converted to normal values. Seven patients with normal coagulation profiles on initial presentation had repeat tests and all remained normal.\nThe incidence of the hypercoagulable state in patients with SVT is high. Thirty-five percent of patients with isolated SVT had consistently abnormal coagulation profiles. Patients with SVT may be prone to the development of DVT or saphenofemoral junction thrombophlebitis and should be closely followed after the initial diagnosis of hypercoagulability.",

    "abstract": "Foot venous pressure measurement is considered to be useful for assessing lower limb venous insufficiency, because venous hypertension is the main factor predisposing to venous insufficiency. In this study, we investigated the utility of foot venous pressure measurement in the evaluation of venous insufficiency.\nA total of 148 limbs of 101 patients with venous insufficiency associated with varicose veins and treated over 5 years were studied. The measurements assessed were percentage decrease in foot venous pressure with manual calf compression (%drop), rate of increase in foot venous pressure during a 4-second period after release of compression (4SR%), and time to 50% recovery of foot venous pressure (RT50).\nA higher incidence of skin changes (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic classification classes 4 to 6) caused by venous insufficiency was associated with %drop, 4SR%, and RT50 values. Skin changes were found in more than 50% of the limbs with a %drop less than 50%, 4SR% more than 50%, or RT50 less than 4 seconds. After tourniquets were applied to occlude the superficial veins, limbs with severe below-knee deep venous reflux (%drop 60.3 +/- 14.6, 4SR% 36.7 +/- 30.2, RT50 13.9 +/- 14.7) showed significantly worse values than those with no reflux (%drop 79.9 +/- 3.2, 4SR% 8.1 +/- 3.1, RT50 48.9 +/- 17.9) or with mild above-knee reflux (%drop 77.0 +/- 5.0, 4SR% 7.1 +/- 3.2, RT50 46.9 +/- 26.7). After sclerotherapy or surgical treatment, including deep venous reconstruction for severe below-knee reflux, all limbs showed significant improvement in clinical manifestations and foot venous pressure values (%drop 68.1 +/- 7.5 to 76.5 +/- 5.8, 4SR% 33.1 +/- 12.9 to 12.7 +/- 7.6, RT50 7.5 +/- 4.2 to 20.1 +/- 6.5).\nFoot venous pressure measurements showed a good correlation with clinical severity and degree of venous reflux and were very useful for evaluating the outcome of therapy for venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "The role of air plethysmography (APG) in the diagnosis of venous disease is not well defined. We conducted this study to investigate the value of APG in the diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency and to determine its correlation with the clinical severity of disease and the anatomic distribution of reflux.\nWe studied 186 lower extremities with duplex scanning and venography and measured the venous volume, venous filling index (VFI), ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction with APG. Limbs were categorized according to the Society for Vascular Surgery and International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery classification of clinical severity of disease and according to the anatomic distribution of valvular incompetence.\nSixty-one limbs had no evidence of disease (class 0), 60 limbs had mild disease (classes 1, 2, and 3), and 65 limbs had severe disease (classes 4, 5, and 6). According to the results of duplex scanning and venography, there was no evidence of reflux in 56 limbs. Isolated superficial venous reflux occurred in 52 limbs, and perforator reflux, alone or in conjunction with superficial reflux, occurred in 30. Deep reflux, with or without superficial reflux, was found in 25 limbs. Deep and perforator reflux, with or without superficial reflux, was found in 19 limbs. The VFI had a sensitivity of 80% and 99% positive predictive value for any type of reflux. The VFI was significantly different between groups of limbs with different clinical severities of disease or different types of reflux. The incidence of deep or perforator reflux in limbs with a normal VFI value was 7%, and it was 82% in limbs with a VFI of more than 5. Among 86 limbs with VFI values not corrected with use of a thigh tourniquet, 28% did not have evidence of deep or perforator reflux, and among 15 limbs with VFI values corrected with the use of a tourniquet, 33% had perforator reflux, deep reflux, or both. All APG parameters had low positive predictive values for severe disease or ulceration. The ejection fraction and residual volume fraction did not influence the clinical severity of disease, did not discriminate between types of reflux, and in combination with the VFI did not improve the predictive value of APG.\nThe VFI measured by APG is an excellent predictor of venous reflux, provides an estimate of the clinical severity of disease, and at high levels predicts deep reflux, perforator reflux, or both. Correction of an abnormal VFI with a thigh tourniquet is an unreliable predictor of the absence of deep or perforator incompetence. The predictive value of APG for severe disease or ulceration is poor. The ejection fraction and residual volume fraction, individually or in combination with the VFI, add little to the diagnostic value of APG, and their routine performance may not be clinically justified.",

    "abstract": "To highlight a special subset of cases of venous stasis in which the profunda femoris vein enlarges to a variable extent (axial transformation) to compensate for severe postthrombotic changes in the accompanying superficial femoral vein.\nAmong 500 consecutively treated patients with severe venous stasis, 57 patients had axial transformation of the profunda femoris vein. Venous obstruction and reflux were assessed by means of arm-foot pressure differential, ambulatory venous pressure measurement, air plethysmography, and duplex examination. Ascending and descending venograms also were obtained. A variety of valve reconstruction techniques were useful in correcting reflux in the enlarged profunda femoris vein and the companion postthrombotic superficial femoral vein.\nIn 55% of patients the profunda femoris vein was larger than normal and provided partial outflow from the leg through a profunda-popliteal connection, but the superficial femoral vein was still the dominant outflow tract (grades I and II). In 36% of patients the profunda femoris was the dominant outflow tract from the leg, and in another 9% it was the sole axial outflow tract (grades III and IV). The skin changes of advanced venous stasis were present among 92% of patients and frank ulceration among 88%. Antireflux operations on the profunda femoris vein and companion superficial femoral vein, including ligation and division in some instances, were well tolerated. Despite a postthrombotic cause, obstruction did not worsen after surgical treatment, and reflux improved according to most laboratory measurements. Complete ulcer healing was obtained with the surgical techniques described. The actuarial recurrence-free survival rates were 90% 1 year and 66% 5 years after treatment.\nAxial transformation of the profunda femoris vein is present in a subset of instances in which severe postthrombotic changes are present in the companion superficial femoral vein. Profunda femoris reflux is invariably present in these instances because of compensatory dilatation and enlargement of this vessel. Simultaneous valve repair of the axially transformed profunda femoris vein and companion superficial femoral vein to abolish reflux yields excellent long-term results and healing of stasis ulceration.",

    "abstract": "Acute complications of atherosclerosis such as stroke and myocardial infarction are caused by thrombosis and may be associated with impaired fibrinolytic activity. The current study was performed to determine whether peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its progression are also associated with impaired fibrinolysis, by measurement of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, the activator of fibrinolysis) and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).\nThe study group consisted of 80 men with a mean age of 69 years. This included 18 patients with mild intermittent claudication (MC, pain-free walking distance > or = 200 meters) and 51 patients with severe claudication (SC, walking distance <200 meters). Eleven age- and sex-matched patients without PAD served as controls. All patients had measurements of serum tPA antigen using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. Serum levels of tPA and PAI-1 activity were assayed with an amidolytic method. Mean +/- SEM levels of the enzyme levels in patients with progressively more severe PAD were compared with normal controls.\nSerum PAI-1 activity levels were significantly elevated in both PAD groups compared with normal controls (p < 0.02). There were no significant differences in the PAI-1 activity levels in groups with worsening degrees of PAD. There was a significant decrease in tPA activity levels in patients with SC (p = 0.01) relative to those with MC and the normal subjects. There was also a significant increase in tPA antigen level in the patients with SC compared with those with MC and the control subjects, as well as a significant inverse correlation between tPA antigen levels and pain-free walking time in patients with claudication (p = 0.001).\nAll patients with PAD in this study had significant reductions in endogenous fibrinolytic activity. Patients with SC had more impaired fibrinolytic activity than those with MC and the control subjects, suggesting that the progression to more severe levels of PAD may be associated with worsening endogenous fibrinolysis.",

Alternative dialytic methods (i.e., external shunts and vascular grafts) cannot easily be applied to pediatric patients, and in addition, these methods are responsible for higher complication rates.\nFrom January 1985 to December 1994, 112 Brescia-Cimino AVFs were performed in 90 children (average age, 5.5 years; range, 5 months to 18 years). The average weight of the children was 28 kg (range, 6.5 to 54 kg); 16% of AVFs were performed in children who were less than 5 years old, and 18% in children who were less than 15 kg in body weight.\nChronic renal failure was caused by a nephropathy in 53 cases (14 with a nephrotic syndrome), and 37 cases had a uropathy. In all cases a phlebography was performed before the microsurgical treatment. Since 1994 an inflatable tourniquet has been placed on the selected upper arm because of an optimal exsanguination of the operating field. The primary patency rate was obtained in all but six of the children; 35% of AVFs had either immediate or late complications. Thrombosis was the most frequent complication that we observed. In comparison with 79% of late thrombosis, 60% of early thrombosis was cured. Of the 80 AVFs, 63.5% with a 4-year follow-up are still patent.\nWe emphasize the following two conclusions: first, microsurgery is essential to create AVFs with good results in children as well as in adult patients; and second, the results improved after the adoption of an upper-arm exsanguination and ischemia (pressure range, 400 mm Hg to 600 mm Hg) that avoided spasm of the vessels with a final 35% reduction in surgical time.",

    "abstract": "Risk for rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is widely believed to be related to its maximum diameter. From a biomechanical standpoint, however, risk is probably more precisely related to mechanical wall stress. Many abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymmetric (for example because of anterior bulging with posterior expansion limited by the vertebral column). The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of maximum diameter and asymmetric bulge on wall stress.\nThree-dimensional computer models of abdominal aortic aneurysms were generated. In one protocol, maximum diameter was held constant while bulge shape factor was varied. The shape factor took into account the asymmetric shape of the bulge. In a second protocol, the shape of the aneurysmal wall was held constant while maximum diameter was varied. Wall stress was computed in each instance with a commercial software package and assumption of physiologic intraluminal pressure.\nBoth maximum diameter and the shape factor were found to have substantial influence on the distribution of wall stress within the aneurysm. In some instances the maximum stress occurred at the midsection, and in others it occurred elsewhere. The magnitude of peak stress acting on the aneurysm increased nonlinearly with increasing maximum diameter or increasing asymmetry.\nOur computer models showed that the stress within the wall of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and possibly the potential for rupture are as dependent on aneurysm shape as they are on maximum diameter. This information may be important in determining severity of individual abdominal aortic aneurysms and in improving understanding of the natural history of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The reduced size of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) after endovascular repair suggests lowered intraaneurysmal pressure. In the presence of endoleaks, the size is not decreased. Although postoperative intraaneurysmal pressure is difficult to record, the pulsatile wall motion (PWM) of aneurysms can be measured noninvasively. The aim of this study was to assess the PWM of AAAs before and after endovascular repair and to relate the change in the PWM to aneurysmal size and presence of endoleaks.\nForty-seven patients underwent endovascular repair of an AAA. The aneurysm diameter and PWM were measured with the use of ultrasonic echo-tracking scans preoperatively; at 1, 3, and 6 months; and thereafter biannually. Fifteen aneurysms developed endoleaks, whereas 32 were completely excluded. The leaks were characterized with the use of computed tomographic scanning and angiography. Median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range, 5 to 24 months).\nThe preoperative PWM of the aneurysms was 1.0 mm (range, 0.8 to 1.3 mm). After complete endovascular exclusion, the PWM was 25% (range, 16% to 37%) of the preoperative value (p < 0.001), and aneurysm diameter decreased by 8 mm (range, 6 to 14 mm) (p < 0.001). After 18 months, no further diameter reduction occurred. In three patients without endoleaks but with enlarging aneurysms, the postoperative PWM showed less reduction (p < 0.05). Aneurysms with endoleaks showed no diameter decrease, and the postoperative PWM was 50% higher than that in the totally excluded cases (p < 0.01). In five patients with transient endoleaks, the PWM was reduced after leakage ceased (p < 0.05). Leaks of various sources displayed similar PWM.\nThe size and PWM of aneurysms are reduced after endovascular repair. The diameter reduction may cease after 1.5 years. Endoleaks are associated with higher PWM than expected. Pressure may be transmitted without evidence of leaks.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) during balloon angioplasty and stenting of atherosclerotic aortoiliac occlusive lesions improved long-term clinical outcome. IVUS has been previously shown to be more accurate than arteriography in evaluating the deployment of stents in both peripheral and coronary arteries. Incomplete stent deployment has been anecdotally identified as a cause of restenosis or occlusion of a treated lesion. To our knowledge, there have been no previous studies that demonstrate whether the use of IVUS will affect the long-term patency rate of stented arterial lesions.\nBetween March 1992 and October 1995, 52 patients with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of their lesions. We retrospectively reviewed these cases to determine whether the use of IVUS influenced the long-term patency rate of these interventions. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 years with a mean of 28 months.\nFifty-two patients had confirmation of adequate stent deployment by arteriography. IVUS was used in conjunction with arteriography in 36 patients to evaluate stent deployment. Patients in the IVUS-assisted group were slightly younger than those patients who were evaluated solely by arteriography (p < 0.01). No statistical differences were noted between the two groups with respect to coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or obesity. Length of hospital stay, number of stents used, and preoperative ankle brachial indexes were comparable in both groups. In the arteriography plus IVUS group, 40% of patients had underdeployed stents by IVUS evaluation, though they appeared adequately expanded by arteriography. No restenoses or occlusions were seen in the arteriography plus IVUS group. Restenosis or occlusion of the stented lesion occurred in 25% of patients evaluated by arteriography alone (p < 0.01). These failures were treated by either thrombolysis or catheter thrombectomy and were then evaluated with IVUS. All were found to have underdeployed stents. Subsequent treatment consisted of adequate redeployment of existing stents using IVUS criteria. These salvaged reconstructions have continued to remain patent.\nThe use of IVUS may be the best means for assessing adequacy of arterial stent deployment. Our study suggests that the use of IVUS improves the long-term clinical outcome of balloon angioplasty and stented aortoiliac occlusive lesions.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to evaluate risk factors, natural history, and clinical consequences of a periprosthetic leak after endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nWe reviewed the initial and follow-up data, including angiograms, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans, abdominal duplex scans, and plain abdominal films for all patients undergoing tube graft repair using the endovascular graft system (early prototype) between February 10, 1993, and January 24, 1995.\nSixty-eight patients underwent placement or attempted placement of a tube graft implant in 13 centers in the United States. Nine patients required conversion to open repair, leaving 59 patients with functioning grafts for evaluation. The mean follow-up time was 27 +/- 8 months (range, 2 to 48 months). Twenty-eight (47%) of 59 patients had initial periprosthetic leaks (6 proximal, 14 distal, 3 proximal and distal, 5 indeterminate) on their first postoperative CT scans. Fourteen (50%) of the initial 28 leaks sealed spontaneously. Two other patients had their leaks sealed by endovascular means, leaving 12 patients with persistent leaks for follow-up evaluation. Four patients developed late leaks between 18 and 24 months of follow-up: one who had a spontaneously sealed initial leak, one with a second leak, and two who developed late leaks. Of the 16 patients with sealed leaks, 10 had aneurysm size reduction during follow-up. Three aneurysm sacs enlarged before spontaneous sealing but have not had sufficient follow-up time to document the size change since the seal. One patient died of respiratory failure 5 months after graft implantation. One patient whose leak was sealed by intervention has not yet had a CT scan for evaluation. In one patient with a sealed leak and whose aneurysm had initially shrunk, the area reopened and progressed to a nonfatal rupture that was surgically corrected. There were two late deaths from unrelated causes. Twelve patients in the sealed group are alive and well. Of the 12 patients with persistent leaks, five underwent open surgical repair without complication, and one underwent successful endovascular repair with a second graft. Six patients continue to live with their initial grafts and have an average aneurysm sac enlargement of 0.1 cm per year.\nAlthough initial periprosthetic leaks were common with the use of this early prototype, 50% spontaneously sealed. The subsequent clinical course of patients with persistently sealed leaks was no different from that of patients who had no leaks. However, continued CT surveillance is warranted, because in one patient with an initially sealed leak, the area reopened and progressed to nonfatal rupture. Another two patients without initial leaks developed late leaks. In a small group of selected patients with continued leaks, their aneurysms appeared to enlarge at a rate considerably slower than would have been expected in patients with untreated aneurysm, suggesting that even a person after endovascular repair with a persistent leak may have had some beneficial hemodynamic modification.",

    "abstract": "The EVEREST Trial was designed to determine whether the surgical technique influences the durability and complications of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The current report focuses on the study design and preliminary results.\nEVEREST is a randomized multicenter trial. A total of 1353 patients with carotid stenosis requiring surgical treatment were randomly assigned to received standard (n = 675) or eversion (n = 678) CEA. Primary end points included carotid occlusion, major stroke, death, and restenosis rate.\nThe rate of perioperative major stroke and death (1.3 for each study group) and the incidence of early carotid occlusion (0.6% for eversion vs 0.4% for standard) were similar. No significant differences were found between eversion and standard CEA with respect to incidence of perioperative transient ischemic accident, minor stroke, cranial nerve injuries, neck hematoma, myocardial infarction, or surgical defects as detected with intraoperative quality controls. Clamping time was significantly shorter for eversion CEA compared with patch standard procedures (31.7 +/- 15.9 vs 34.5 +/- 14.4 minutes, p = 0.02). A shunt was inserted in 11% of patients undergoing eversion CEAs and in 16% of patients undergoing standard procedures. Overall 30-day events occurred in 13.3% of the eversion group and in 11.4% of the standard group (p = 0.3). At a mean follow-up of 14.9 months (range, 1 to 38 months), 16 (2.4%) restenoses occurred in the eversion group and 28 (4.1%) occurred in the standard group (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.1; p = 0.08).\nThe preliminary results of the EVEREST Trial suggest that eversion CEA is a safe and rapid procedure with low major complication rates. No significant differences in restenosis rates were observed between eversion and standard CEA at the available follow-up. Longer-term results are necessary to assess whether the eversion technique influences the durability of CEA.",

Thrombin stimulation of vascular smooth muscle is associated with activation of mitogen-associated protein kinase.

The activity of a novel kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein-2 kinase (MAPKAP2 kinase), was determined by immunoprecipitation and a phosphotransferase assay. A small heat shock protein, HSP27, was identified with immunoblotting.\nThrombin induces contraction of vascular smooth muscle and is associated with increased activity of MAPKAP2 kinase and increased phosphorylation of HSP27. Multiple isoforms of HSP27 are the predominant phosphoproteins in vascular smooth muscle, and peptide mapping suggests that the isoforms of HSP27 are structurally related and phosphorylated within similar peptide sequences.\nActivation of the MAPKAP2 kinase pathway and phosphorylation of HSP27 are associated with thrombin-induced contraction of vascular smooth muscle.",

    "abstract": "The antiproliferative and antisecretory effects of somatostatin have many potential uses in the clinical setting. Retroviral gene transfer of somatostatin to endothelium is a potential means of local delivery of this peptide to specific vascular beds. This investigation was designed to determine whether transduced endothelial cells (ECs) could produce and post-translationally process somatostatin.\nCultured canine venous, rat aortic, and rat microvascular ECs were transfected with retroviruses containing a human somatostatin cDNA or a control beta-galactosidase gene. Total and isoform somatostatin production and uniformity of beta-galactosidase expression were analyzed, as were the effects of somatostatin production on EC proliferation.\nSomatostatin-transduced canine venous ECs, but not rat ECs, produced approximately 10 times as much total somatostatin as did control-transfected ECs (450 +/- 32 vs 49 +/- 10 pmol/L, p < 0.05). The predominant isoform of somatostatin produced was somatostatin-14. Production of somatostatin was stable with passage and did not impair the growth of canine ECs. The failure of rat ECs to produce somatostatin correlated with nonuniform expression of beta-galactosidase, suggesting that promoter silencing was responsible for failure of transgene expression.\nRetroviral gene transfer of somatostatin to canine ECs results in the production of physiologically relevant concentrations of biologically active somatostatin. Significant species differences exist in EC production of somatostatin, with promoter silencing being a potential mechanism of failure of gene expression. Gene therapy strategies using retroviral transfer of somatostatin to ECs may allow somatostatin delivery to focal areas of the vasculature.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine whether videoendoscopic thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery bypass is a technically feasible operation.\nAn acute canine study involving five mongrel dogs was carried out. After the dogs had been given a general anesthetic, the femoral arteries were exposed in the traditional fashion. On the left side, a retroperitoneal, retrorenal tunnel was extended from the common femoral artery to the diaphragm. Under videoendoscopic control, the tunnel was opened through the posterior thoracic attachments of the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity. A Dacron graft was tunneled from the thoracic cavity on the left to the left groin. The thoracic aorta was controlled with a side-biting clamp, and an endoscopically performed end graft-to-side thoracic aortic anastomosis was created. After completion of the thoracic anastomosis, the left femoral anastomosis was created in a traditional manner. A left-to-right femoral bypass completed the lower extremity vascular procedure. An open thoracotomy was avoided.\nVideoendoscopic thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery bypass was successfully performed in all five animals. All components of the thoracic procedure, including exposure, dissection, vessel control, cross-clamping, and anastomosis, were performed through the thoracic ports with conventional laparoscopic instruments. Blood loss was minimal. All animals survived the procedure before being killed.\nVideoendoscopic thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery bypass is a technically feasible operation in a canine model. Advantages of this unique approach over the experimental laparoscopic and the traditional transperitoneal open aortofemoral bypass include ease of aortic exposure, ability to control a segment of disease-free aorta, and anastomosis in a disease-free segment of aorta. Potential advantages include decreased perioperative morbidity rates with the videoendoscopic approach. Before there is clinical consideration of this surgical approach, long-term experiments are required to demonstrate the safety of the procedure.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome after the shortening and reimplantation of tortuous internal carotid arteries to prevent kinking after endarterectomy.\nThrough a review of prospective records, we studied patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) (n = 233) between 1993 and 1996 who had symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) of more than 70%. An elongated proximal ICA was excised, and the ICA was reimplanted into the bifurcation in 30 (13%) patients, with additional patch angioplasty in 5 patients. Of the remaining 203 patients, 50 (21%) had Dacron patch angioplasty, and the rest had conventional CEA with simple closure.\nIn the reimplanted group, one patient had a minor stroke with complete recovery on discharge. Three patients (10%) had neck hematomas requiring reexploration, but in none of these was the bleeding from the artery. At mean follow-up of 15 months, 93% of the arteries were widely patent. Significant stenosis secondary to neointimal hyperplasia was detected in only two patients, for a restenosis rate of 6.7%, which is in line with other published reports. In the control group, 8 (3.9%) patients had perioperative transient ischemic attacks, 5 (2.5%) had strokes, and 13 (6.4%) had hematomas requiring evacuation. At follow-up, 14 (6.9%) of the arteries had restenosed.\nIn carotid surgery, reconstructive techniques must be tailored to operative findings. Excision of a tortuous elongated proximal ICA with reimplantation is not associated with additional mortality or morbidity rates over those of conventional CEA alone and has the advantage of removing disease at the bifurcation. This procedure was carried out in 13% of our patients and should be a procedure with which the vascular surgeon is familiar.",

    "abstract": "We describe our initial experience with the use of perigeniculate vessels as outflow tracts in infrainguinal revascularizations for critical limb ischemia.\nTwenty-two such reconstructions were carried out in 20 patients over a 2-year period. Indications for surgery consisted of tissue loss in 9 patients and rest pain in the other 13 patients. Inflow was obtained from the femoral vessels. A variety of graft materials were used, including saphenous vein (16 patients), polytetrafluoroethylene (2 patients), composite (1 patient), and arterial homografts (3 patients). The perigeniculate vessels used were the medial sural artery to the gastrocnemius (arteria suralis) in 16 patients and the highest genicular artery (arteria genu suprema) in the other 6 patients. These vessels were approached via a medial above-the-knee popliteal-type exposure.\nThere were three postoperative deaths. Mean follow-up for the other 17 patients averaged 12 months (range, 3 to 37 months). Three grafts failed (thrombosis) during follow-up, leading to two above-the-knee amputations. One graft stenosis was treated with percutaneous angioplasty. The average postoperative increase in the ankle-brachial index was 0.20.\nThese early results appear promising with a 1-year primary patency rate of 77%, assisted primary patency rate of 85%, and a limb-salvage rate of 90% according to the Kaplan-Meier life-table method. This technique is particularly useful when adequate length saphenous vein is not available, no other outflow vessels are available, or other outflow vessels are very calcified and not safely clamped. The continued study of the long-term effectiveness is warranted.",

PKC from the soluble and particulate fraction were separated by centrifugation, and protein normalized immunoblots were performed with antibodies to the PKC isoforms alpha, betaI, betaII, delta, epsilon, gamma and zeta. Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed densitometrically, with results expressed as the mean percentage of each fraction +/- SEM. Translocation was defined as a significant (p < 0.05) change in the particulate fraction for each isoform. Immunofluorescent staining of cultured SMC visualized the resting location and stimulated translocation of each isoform.\nIsoforms alpha and betaI were detected primarily in the soluble fraction, translocating to the particulate fraction with TPA stimulation (p < 0.0001). The isoforms betaII, delta, and epsilon were found primarily in the particulate fraction and did not translocate. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed these locations. Neither gamma or zeta were detected in these SMC.\nThe PKC isoforms expressed in human arterial SMC differ from those reported in animal models. Their specific locations and response to stimulation suggest unique functions in cellular regulation and provide the groundwork for further investigation into their role in the development of vascular disease and regulation of matrix metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration to the subintima or intimal hyperplasia (IH) occur after arterial injury and are thought to be induced by mitogenic factors released from activated platelets. Because low flow (LF) and shear have been attributed to the localization and progression of IH, we postulated that hemodynamic factors may regulate the degree of platelet activation, as measured by plasma thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) release at regions of experimental arterial injury.\nThe right common carotid artery (CCA) was subjected to balloon injury in 18 New Zealand White male rabbits. Flow in the injured CCA was reduced by out-flow ligation (LF group, n = 6) or increased by ligation of the left CCA (high flow [HF] group, n = 6). In six other animals, flow was preserved (normal flow [NF] group). Mean blood flow and pressure in the right CCA were measured thereafter at 10 and 30 minutes. Plasma TXB2 and PDGF-AB levels were determined with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method in each animal with blood samples taken systematically before injury (baseline) and in the distal CCA at similar time points.\nAt 10 minutes, mean blood flow was reduced from 20 +/- 2 ml/min in the NF group to 7 +/- 1 ml/min in the LF group animals (p < 0.01) and increased to 32 +/- 2 ml/min in the HF group animals (p < 0.05). Mean arterial blood pressure did not differ among the groups. Hemodynamic parameters were similar at 10 and 30 minutes. TXB2 levels were more than fourfold greater in the LF group than in the HF and NF groups at both time points (p < 0.05). In addition, there was a twofold increase in plasma PDGF-AB level at 10 minutes in the LF group compared with baseline levels (p < 0.05).\nPlatelet activation at regions of acute vascular injury was determined to be flow dependent. Upregulated platelet activity in low flow conditions may be due to increased platelet exposure time to subendothelial collagen and is greatly attenuated if normal or increased flow is present.",

    "abstract": "A significant limitation to using genetically modified endothelial cells (ECs) to seed prosthetic grafts before implantation has been poor cell adherence to the graft lumen. Methodologic changes to improve cell adherence were evaluated in a canine carotid interposition graft model using 4 mm interior diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene.\nECs harvested from external jugular veins were grown in culture, with 80% of the cells from each culture transduced by incubation with an LXSN-type retroviral vector carrying a gene for human prourokinase and a neomycin resistance gene for selection in antibiotic G418. Control grafts had passive luminal coating with fibronectin and were seeded with transduced ECs immediately after G418 selection; these grafts were incubated for 2 days before implantation. Experimental grafts had fibronectin forcefully squeezed through the interstices and were seeded with ECs that had recovered in culture for 5 days after G418 selection; these grafts were incubated for 4 days before implantation. For each control (n = 9) and experimental (n = 12) graft, a graft prepared in the same fashion but seeded with the remaining autologous nontransduced cells was placed in the contralateral carotid artery. Grafts were explanted after 30 days and were evaluated for patency, thrombus-free surface area, and cell-free surface area.\nNo significant differences in patency rates were seen between any groups. The thrombus-free surface area was improved for experimental grafts (90%) compared with control grafts (76%), but this improvement did not achieve statistical significance. The cell-free surface area for transduced cells on experimental grafts was 65% compared with 96% for control grafts (p = 0.021) and was comparable with that for nontransduced cells on both control grafts (62%) and experimental grafts (51%; p = 0.201).\nAdherence of genetically modified endothelial cells to small-diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in an in vivo physiologic flow model is significantly improved when cells have a more prolonged recovery from G418 selection, when the graft lumen is more uniformly coated with fibronectin before EC seeding, and when seeded grafts are left longer in culture before implantation to develop cell lining stability. The short-term patency rate of these seeded grafts is not affected by increased cell retention; long-term graft patency data and luminal healing require further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Thromboresistant synthetic grafts should decrease the frequency of graft thromboses and could be useful in bypasses to small arteries and to arteries with compromised flow. Heparin-bonded grafts (HBG) have been developed. Studies were done to determine whether the heparin bond is permanent and whether the HBG would aggregate platelets in the presence of heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies (HAAbs).\nWe studied an 8 mm HBG from company A (HBGA) and 8 mm and 6 mm HBGs from company B (HBGB-8 and HBGB-6), none of which is available for clinical use in the United States. Five 1 cm long segments of HBGA, HBGB-8, and HBGB-6 were incubated for 24 hours in 5 ml of plasma, 10 ml of saline, or 10 ml of Ringer's lactate. After incubation, 1 ml was obtained from each solution and assayed for heparin. Segments of each graft that leached off an equivalent of 1 U of heparin/ml (i.e., 1 mm2 of HBGA, 5 mm2 of HBGB-8, and 20 mm2 of HBGB-6) were incubated with 0.15 ml of plasma with HAAbs (six samples per graft) for 30 minutes at 25 degrees C. The grafts were removed, and 0.1 ml of normal-donor, platelet-rich plasma was added. The samples were placed in an aggregometer and allowed to react until positive aggregation occurred or 27 minutes had elapsed. Segments of non-heparin-bonded polyester grafts served as controls.\nHeparin leached off all grafts in plasma (mean values: HBGA, 83.4 U of heparin/ml; HBGB-8, 4 U of heparin/ml; HBGB-6, 6.2 U of heparin/ml). In normal saline, the mean heparin concentrations were lower (HBGA, 10.8 U of heparin/ml; HBGB-8, 0 U of heparin/ml; HBGB-6, 0.01 U of heparin/ml. The mean heparin concentration after incubation in Ringer's lactate were 10 U of heparin/ml for HBGA, 0 U of heparin/ml HBGB-8, and 0.22 U of heparin/ml HBGB-6. All of the HBGs induced platelet aggregation inHAAb-positive plasma. None of the control grafts induced platelet aggregation in HAAb-positive plasma.\nAll HBGs leached heparin into plasma, and all induced platelet aggregation in the presence of HAAbs. The possibility of sensitizing patients to heparin leeching from a HBG with the activation of platelets and secondary thrombosis strongly suggests that HBG be used with great caution. Other methods for inducing graft thromboresistance should be developed.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) modulates new blood vessel development and growth and has been suggested as a potential therapeutic agent that could alleviate debilitating claudication in patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether controlled, local delivery of a low dose of VEGF from an osmotic pump could promote neovascularization, limb perfusion, and functional improvements in the hind limbs of rabbits rendered partially ischemic by surgery. The effects of VEGF were compared with those of the vasodilator nitroglycerin (NTG) and to saline administered similarly.\nThirty rabbits were randomly assigned to either VEGF (n = 10), NTG (n = 10), or saline (n = 10) treatment groups. Partial ischemia was induced in each left hind limb by surgical ligation of the common and superficial femoral arteries, leaving the internal iliac artery intact. The right limb of each animal served as a nonischemic control. Immediately after vessel ligations, a 28-day osmotic pump was implanted to deliver VEGF (0.22 microg/kg/day), NTG (17.8 microg/kg/day), or saline solution into the common iliac artery just proximal to the ligation site. Comparative vascularity between ischemic and nonischemic limbs within treatment groups and between groups was evaluated by (1) capillary counts from representative fields of hematoxylin and eosin stained muscle tissue taken from hind limbs at day 40; (2) digitized arteriograms of ischemic legs at day 40, which were used to quantify the complexity of vascular branching (fractal dimension index) and the total extent of vascularization (vascular density index); (3) measuring capillary refill times in ischemic limbs; and (4) observations of functional and trophic changes in ischemic limbs. Statistical differences between treatment groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA.\nComplexity of vascular branching and vascular density were significantly greater (p < 0.001) in VEGF-treated ischemic limbs compared with NTG- and saline-treated ischemic limbs. By postoperation day 14, all VEGF-treated ischemic limbs had restored capillary refill (p < 0.001), new hair growth, and greatly improved limb function and appearance. Saline-treated limbs exhibited ischemic changes, with poor capillary refill and negligible limb function. Capillary refill in NTG-treated ischemic limbs did not differ significantly from saline-treated limbs. Ischemic VEGF-treated limbs had significantly more capillaries compared with both ischemic and nonischemic limbs in saline-treated animals (p < 0.05). Ischemic NTG-treated limbs also had significantly more capillaries compared with ischemic limbs in saline-treated animals (p < 0.05). Because of high variability, however, capillary counts in VEGF-treated ischemic limbs did not differ significantly from those of contralateral nonischemic limbs, or from capillary counts in either ischemic or nonischemic limbs of NTG-treated rabbits.\nControlled release of microgram quantities of VEGF significantly enhanced neovascularization and vascular perfusion in ischemic limbs compared with controls in this rabbit model of partial ischemia. In addition, VEGF-treated ischemic limbs demonstrated near-normal function and appearance, whereas NTG- and saline-treated ischemic controls remained noticeably impaired. This novel approach of VEGF delivery may prove clinically useful either alone or combined with revascularization procedures.",

    "abstract": "We present a review of 35 patients who underwent an operation for subclavian (n = 18) or axillary (n = 17) vessel injury. In some patients, both an artery and a vein were damaged, resulting in a total of 30 arterial and 16 venous injuries.\nThe wounding source included a gunshot (n = 19), a stab wound (n = 9,) and blunt trauma (n = 7). Seven patients had hypotension and were taken immediately to the operating room. Seventeen patients had diminished or absent pulses, whereas 13 patients had normal pulses despite an arterial injury. Associated injuries included nerve injury (n = 15), pneumohemothorax (n = 5), and fractures (n = 7). Angiography in 21 patients demonstrated an intimal flap (n = 8), extravasation (n = 5), a pseudoaneurysm (n = 3), an arteriovenous fistula (n = 2), and occlusion (n = 1). Two angiograms were normal. Arterial repair was accomplished by interposition graft (n = 17), primary repair (n = 9), patch angioplasty (n = 3,) and ligation (n = 1).\nNo functional deficits occurred in patients with an isolated vascular injury. Seven patients with associated brachial plexus injuries experienced severe disability. One arm of a patient was amputated. Two patients died.\nThe use of angiography helps to confirm and localize injuries. Prompt correction of the vascular injury avoids disability resulting from ischemia. Although the amputation rate is low with vascular repair, the functional disability resulting from associated nerve injuries can be devastating.",

    "abstract": "In carotid artery disease, correlation of carotid plaque morphology with the patient's presenting symptoms has drawn conflicting conclusions. The purpose of this series was to correlate carotid plaque characteristics with the presenting symptoms from a large cohort of patients who underwent operation for carotid artery disease.\nFrom a series of 1252 consecutive patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy, presenting symptoms were divided into three groups: transiently symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA] or amaurosis fugax), prior stroke, and asymptomatic. Plaque characteristics, including ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and degree of stenosis, were recorded prospectively for 1008 procedures. All endarterectomy specimens were inspected during the procedure, and plaque characteristics were recorded immediately after operation.\nThere was a higher incidence of plaque ulceration in the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke groups (391 of 508 [77%] and 91 of 115 [79%]) than in the asymptomatic cohort (231 of 385 [60%]; p < 0.0001, chi2 test). There was no significant difference in the incidence of plaque hemorrhage between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke patients compared with the asymptomatic patients. There was no statistical difference for ulcerated plaque or plaque hemorrhage between the transiently symptomatic and prior stroke group. Intraplaque hemorrhage occurred more frequently in patients with high-grade stenosis (90% to 99%) than in those with less than 90% stenosis (202 of 299 [68%] versus 97 of 299 [32%]; p = 0.01, chi2 test).\nOn gross examination of the carotid specimen in the operating room, plaque ulceration correlates with an initial presentation of amaurosis fugax, TIA, or prior stroke compared with patients operated on for asymptomatic disease. The presence of intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with more advanced stenosis of the internal carotid artery. These findings suggest that plaque morphology does play an important role in the presentation of carotid artery disease.",

One hundred procedures (55%) were performed for severe asymptomatic stenosis, whereas 48 (26%) were performed for hemispheric transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or amaurosis fugax, 24 (13%) for prior stroke, and 10 (5%) for vertebrobasilar symptoms. Thirteen CEAs (7%) were combined with myocardial revascularization, and another five (3%) represented carotid reoperations. Nine arteriotomies (5%) were closed primarily, whereas the remaining 173 (95%) were repaired using either vein patch angioplasty (141, 77%) or synthetic patches (32, 18%). Two patients were lost to follow-up, but late information was available for 165 patients (180 operations) at a mean interval of 2.7 years (median, 2.4 years; maximum, 7.4 years).\nConsidering all 182 procedures, there were five early (<30 days) postoperative neurologic events (2.7%), including three strokes (1.6%) and two TIAs (1.1%). An additional 15 neurologic events occurred during the late follow-up period, consisting of 11 strokes (6.1%) and four TIAs (2.2%). The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year rate of freedom from stroke was 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77% to 93%). There was one early postoperative death (0.6%) of cardiac complications 9 days after CEA. The estimated 5-year survival rate was 45% (95% CI, 33% to 57%), and the 5-year stroke-free survival rate was 42% (95% CI, 30% to 53%). Multivariable analysis yielded age at operation (p = 0.001), abnormal creatinine level (p = 0.025), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.019) as variables that significantly influenced the survival rate. The presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.009) and, surprisingly, a lesser degree of contralateral internal carotid stenosis (p = 0.003) were found to be significantly associated with stroke after CEA. Causes of late death were cardiovascular in 16 patients (30%), unknown in 13 (24%), carcinoma in six (11%), stroke in six (11%), and miscellaneous in 13 (24%).\nWe conclude that CEA may be safely performed in selected octogenarians with carotid stenosis, and that the majority of these patients live the rest of their lives free from stroke. Therefore, age alone should not exclude otherwise-qualified candidates from consideration for CEA.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to assess the outcome of distal vertebral artery (VA) reconstructions through a retrospective review conducted at a university-affiliated referral center.\nOne hundred consecutive distal VA reconstructions had been performed during a period of 14 years (98 patients) and included reversed saphenous vein bypass from the ipsilateral common, internal, or external carotid to the third portion of the VA at the C1-2 level (68 reconstructions) or the C0-1 level (4); transposition of the external carotid or its occipital branch to the VA (23); and transposition of the third portion of the VA onto the internal carotid artery (2). Other methods were used in 3 additional patients. Eighteen patients underwent concomitant carotid operations, and 1 patient underwent a concomitant subclavian transposition. Symptoms were present in 98% of patients and included vertebrobasilar ischemia (89%), vertebrobasilar plus hemispheric ischemia (7%), and hemispheric ischemia (2%). Two asymptomatic patients with bilateral carotid occlusions underwent operations to provide a single artery for cerebral perfusion (2%). Sixty-three lesions were atherosclerotic, 18 were dynamic bony compressions, and 14 were dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, arteritis, or aneurysm. Five had miscellaneous anatomic indications.\nStroke caused the four perioperative deaths that occurred. There was one occurrence of nonfatal hemispheric stroke. Routine postoperative arteriography identified 16 graft abnormalities; 11 patients underwent attempted revision. The introduction of the use of intraoperative angiography in 1990, halfway through the series, lowered the incidence of graft abnormalities from 28% to 4% and the incidence of perioperative death from 6% to 2%. Eighty-seven percent of patients had complete or significant resolution of symptoms. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 168 months (mean, 79 months). Ten patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty late deaths occurred; none were stroke related. Five reconstructions required late revision.

    "abstract": "The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) advocated the use of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), nondisabling strokes, and ipsilateral high-grade stenosis in highly selected patients. Whether similar results are achieved when CEA is applied to an entire geographically defined population is unknown but important if the NASCET recommendations are to be applied broadly to all community patients.\nTo determine the survival rate to ipsilateral stroke after CEA for all symptomatic patients in a defined population, we reviewed the medical records of all patients residing in Olmsted County, Minn. (approximately 100,000), who underwent a CEA for TIA or nondisabling stroke between 1970 and 1995. Their outcomes were compared with the NASCET results.\nIn the community of Olmsted County, 297 patients (108 women and 189 men) underwent 322 CEAs during the study period. TIAs or nondisabling stroke was the indication in 254 patients (86%), whereas the remaining 14% had asymptomatic stenosis. After CEA for symptomatic lesions, survival rate free of ipsilateral stroke was 97% at 2 years, 93% at 5 years, and 92% at 10 years. These results are similar to the NASCET survival rates free of ipsilateral stroke at 2 years (91%). However, the 30-day postoperative stroke rate for patients older than 80 years was significantly higher than that for patients younger than 80 years.\nWhen the NASCET results are compared with a population-based experience in which all symptomatic patients undergoing CEA were analyzed, the early outcomes were similar. Our population-based data also document the remarkably durable long-term results of CEA in preventing stroke and present another benchmark for carotid stent angioplasty.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of developing acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia in patients identified by lateral aortography to have significant mesenteric artery stenosis.\nFrom 1989 through 1995, 980 consecutive aortograms with anteroposterior and lateral projections were reviewed within 1 week of arteriography to identify patients who had significant mesenteric stenosis but no symptoms of mesenteric ischemia. Eighty-two patients were found to have 50% stenosis of at least one mesenteric artery and were monitored by interview to determine if symptoms of acute or chronic mesenteric ischemia developed.\nTen patients were lost to follow-up, and 12 patients were withdrawn from the study because of mild mesenteric arterial disease (1% to 49% stenosis) in combination with more significant disease of other vessels. Follow-up was 1 to 6 years. The overall mortality rate was 40%, and mesenteric ischemia developed in four patients. Each of these four patients had significant (>50%) stenosis or occlusion of the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. Eighty-six percent of the 15 patients with significant three-vessel arterial disease had mesenteric ischemia, had other vague abdominal symptoms, or died.\nPatients with significant three-vessel mesenteric arterial stenosis should be considered for prophylactic mesenteric arterial reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Physiologic observations with blood flow waveform analysis and pressure measurements can document the severity of lower extremity arterial disease. Segmental blood pressures (SEGPs) taken at the thigh, calf, and ankle are commonly used, but their utility has seldom been studied. We quantified improvements in accuracy compared with arteriography when ankle pressures alone (ABI) or SEGP data were added to velocity waveforms obtained by Doppler ultrasound.\nContinuous-wave Doppler velocity waveforms were recorded at common femoral (CFA), popliteal (POP), and dorsal pedal and posterior tibial (TIB) arterial levels. Systolic SEGP data were obtained with appropriately sized upper thigh, upper calf, and ankle cuffs. Waveforms, waveforms plus ABI, and waveforms plus SEGP data from 81 patients were randomly interpreted by 14 technologists or physicians from four institutions blinded to clinical and arteriographic data. Arteriograms were assigned negative or significant, severe (>75% diameter stenosis) values for four segments: iliofemoral (CFA), superficial femoral (SFA), popliteal (POP), and infrapopliteal (TIB) arteries. A total of 9072 segmental interpretations were analyzed.\nCompared with arteriography, the accuracy of waveform analysis was 83% for severe disease at and proximal to the CFA, 79% for SFA disease, 64% for POP disease, and 73% for TIB disease. Adding ABI improved the accuracy significantly (p < 0.01) to 88% (CFA), 86% (SFA), 70% (POP), and 85% (TIB). Accuracy was inferior when SEGP data replaced ABI: 86% (CFA), 85% (SFA), 70% (POP), and 80% (TIB).\nABIs significantly improved Doppler waveform accuracy at all levels. Compared with ABI, the addition of segmental pressure to waveform data failed to improve accuracy. Pressure measurements above the ankle may lack cost effectiveness and clinical utility.",

A mathematical model of paraplegia risk was used to study the efficacy of paraplegia reduction strategies. We analyzed preoperative and operative factors for paralysis risk, renal function, and mortality for 217 consecutive patients surgically treated from 1984 through 1996 for 176 thoracoabdominal and 41 thoracic aneurysms at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. No patient had intercostal reimplantation or assisted circulation. One hundred fifty patients (group A) received cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) and low-dose naloxone (1 microg/kg/hour) as adjuncts to reduce the risk of paralysis. Sixty-seven patients (group B) did not receive CSFD and naloxone.\nSeventeen deficits occurred in 205 surviving patients: 5 of the 147 in group A (expected deficits = 31) and 12 of the 58 in group B (expected deficits = 13) (p < 0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression model, acute presentation, Crawford type 2 aneurysm, group B membership, and a decrease in cardiac index with aortic occlusion remained significant risk factors for deficit (p < 0.0001). By odds ratio analysis, group A patients had 1/40th the risk of paralysis of group B. The only significant predictor of postoperative renal function was the preoperative creatinine level (p < 0.0001); renal revascularization significantly improved renal function. The mortality rate was 1.6% (2) for patients undergoing elective treatment and 21% (19) for patients who had acute presentations. Acute presentation, age, and the preoperative creatinine level were found to be significant factors for operative mortality in a logistic regression model (p < 0.001) and defined a group at high risk for death.\nCSFD and low-dose naloxone significantly reduce the paralysis risk associated with thoracoabdominal aortic replacement. A decrease in the cardiac index with aortic occlusion is a previously unreported variable that defines a subset of patients at higher risk for paralysis.",

    "abstract": "Long-term survival and late vascular complications in patients who survived repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA) is not well known. The current study compared late outcome after repair of RAAA with those observed in patients who survived elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nThe records of 116 patients, 102 men and 14 women (mean age: 72.5 (8.3 years), who survived repair of RAAA (group I) between 1980 to 1989 were reviewed. Late vascular complications and survival were compared with an equal number of survivors of elective AAA repair matched for sex, age, surgeon, and date of operation (group II). Survival was also compared with the age and sex-matched white population of west-north central United States.\nLate vascular complications occurred in 17% (20/116) of patients in group I and in 8% (9/116) in group II. Paraanastomotic aneurysms occurred more frequently in group I than in group II (17 vs. 8, p = 0.004). At follow-up, 32 patients (28%) were alive in group I (median survival: 9.4 years) and 53 patients (46%) were alive in group II (median survival: 8.7 years). Cumulative survival rates after successful RAAA repair at 1, 5, and 10 years were 86%, 64%, and 33%, respectively. These were significantly lower than survival rates at the same intervals after elective repair (97%, 74%, and 43%, respectively, p = 0.02) or survival of the general population (95%, 75%, and 52%, respectively, p < 0.001). Coronary artery disease was the most frequent cause of late death in both groups. Vascular and graft-related complications caused death in 3% (3/116) in group I and 1% (1/116) in group II. Cox proportional hazards modeling identified age (p = 0.0001), cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.009), and number of days on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01) to be independent prognostic determinants of late survival in group I.\nLate vascular complications after repair of RAAA were higher and late survival rates lower than after elective repair. These data support elective repair of AAA. As two-thirds of the patients discharged after repair of RAAA are alive at 5 years, aggressive management of RAAA remains justified.",

Cumulative survival rates after successful RAAA repair at 1, 5, and 10 years were 86%, 64%, and 33%, respectively. These were significantly lower than survival rates at the same intervals after elective repair (97%, 74%, and 43%, respectively, p = 0.02) or survival of the general population (95%, 75%, and 52%, respectively, p < 0.001). Coronary artery disease was the most frequent cause of late death in both groups. Vascular and graft-related complications caused death in 3% (3/116) in group I and 1% (1/116) in group II. Cox proportional hazards modeling identified age (p = 0.0001), cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.009), and number of days on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01) to be independent prognostic determinants of late survival in group I.",

    "abstract": "We determined the natural history of the residual native infrarenal aortic segment after conventional abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nFor the retrospective arteriographic case series, 800 hundred translumbar aortograms (TLAs) were obtained for 272 patients, before and after conventional AAA repair. The main outcome measures were changes in the aortographic diameter and the length of the infrarenal aortic segment, corrected and uncorrected for magnification by normalization to the first lumbar vertebral body height.\nThe mean follow-up time from the preoperative TLA to the most recent postoperative TLA was 42 months (range, 1 to 257 months). Vertebral body height did not change (p = 0.35). The length of the native infrarenal aorta cephalad to the proximal anastomosis increased a mean of 3 mm, from 23 to 26 mm (p = 0.001). However, in 115 patients (43%), this aortic segment elongated more than 5 mm, and in 63 patients (24%), it elongated more than 10 mm. The native residual infrarenal aorta above the proximal anastomosis dilated a mean of 1 mm, from 23 to 24 mm (p = 0.001), but in 21 patients (8%), it dilated more than 5 mm. There was a weak positive correlation between the increase in residual native aortic diameter and duration of follow-up. There was a negative correlation between this increase and the initial size. The diameters of the proximal anastomosis and proximal graft did not change. Marked variability in the changes in aortic dimensions was observed.\nA mean period of 42 months after conventional AAA repair, the native infrarenal aortic segment elongates and dilates. Although such enlargement is statistically significant, the average increase appears to be small. However, residual aortic cuff diameter increased more than 5 mm and neck length more than 10 mm in a significant number of patients, with potentially serious implications for endovascular treatment of AAA.",

Group 3 (n = 11) was postmenopausal and taking estrogen replacement therapy; the mean age was 53 years (range 43-58 years). Eleven women in group 1 underwent testing twice, once during menstruation (mean serum estradiol level 73 +/- 30 pg/ml) and once during midcycle (mean serum estradiol level 268 +/- 193 pg/ml; p = 0.003). Single-point laser Doppler ultrasound and laser Doppler imaging with a scanner were used to measure vasodilatation in the forearm skin in response to iontophoresis of 1% acetylcholine (endothelium dependent) and 1% sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent smooth muscle relaxant).\nAll three groups were matched for body mass index and fasting glucose, total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. All women had normal blood pressure, and none smoked. Mean serum estradiol levels were 196 +/- 170 pg/ml (group 1), 35 +/- 12 pg/ml (group 2), and 107 +/- 78 pg/ml (group 3) (p = 0.004).

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of ionic and nonionic contrast agents on endothelial cell (EC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, and to determine the role of osmolality as the etiology of these effects.\nCultured bovine aorta EC and SMC were exposed to ionic (iothalamate meglumine) or nonionic (ioversol or iopamidol) contrast, or varying osmolar solutions of mannitol, for periods of 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 minutes. Cells were then incubated in growth media at 37 degrees C and proliferation and structure were assessed 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later.\nBoth EC and SMC showed decreased proliferation after brief exposure to both ionic and nonionic contrast. Proliferation was markedly decreased at 24 hours after exposure, and began to recover by day 3 after exposure. EC showed a significant decrease up to 7 days after exposure to ionic contrast (p < 0.03), whereas SMC showed a significant decrease up to 7 days after exposure to nonionic contrast (p < 0.001). The decrease in proliferation was directly dependent on the length of exposure to the contrast and the concentration of the contrast. EC proliferation decreased in proportion to increasing osmolality of the test solution (p < 0.05). SMC proliferation did not show a decrease proportional to osmolality. No change was observed in cell viability as assessed by LDH activity studies. After contrast exposure, bare areas with no cells present were noted in the previously confluent EC and SMC culture wells. Cell structure was altered immediately after exposure to contrast, with normal structure recovered by 24 hours after exposure.\nThis study demonstrates that brief exposure to contrast agents injures EC and SMC, altering their structure and decreasing proliferation for up to 7 days in vitro. This response is both dose and time dependent. EC are more severely affected by ionic contrast, and SMC are more severely affected by nonionic contrast. EC injury appears to be mediated by the osmolar effect of the contrast, but the effects of contrast on SMC seem to be due to a different mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Our laboratory has developed methods required to covalently bind recombinant hirudin (rHir) to the surface of polyester vascular grafts. Using alkaline hydrolysis of the polyester surface, carboxyl-binding sites are created on the outer periphery of each fiber. A series of static, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that surface-bound rHir rapidly removes and inhibits activated human alpha-thrombin from the reaction system; however, the performance of this modified graft material under physiologic flow conditions was undefined.\nAn in vitro flow loop was used to evaluate structural stability of the 125I-rHir and 131I-albumin covalently bound to the surface of 6 mm interior diameter crimped polyester grafts exposed to either constant flow (n = 4; shear rate, 300 sec(-1)) or pulsatile flow (n = 4; maximum shear rate, 780 sec(-1)) conditions for a 7-day period. In a separate series of experiments, the kinetics of thrombin-rHir interaction were evaluated through perfusion of 125I-rHir-coated grafts (n = 6) with 131I-thrombin for a 27-hour period under constant flow conditions. Identically prepared 125I-albumin-coated grafts (n = 3) were used as controls.\nResults of the stability experiments were independent of flow conditions, demonstrating moderate loss of both proteins, with rHir and albumin losses of 52.1% and 19.9% under constant flow and 49.1% and 21.6% under pulsatile flow, respectively. With results comparable with those of previous static experiments, rHir-coated grafts were significantly more effective at removing thrombin from the perfusion stream with 131I-thrombin binding densities of 3.08 +/- 0.61 and 0.64 +/- 0.04 NIHU/cm2 (p < 0.01) for rHir-coated and albumin-coated grafts, respectively. Estimates of the total amount of thrombin inactivated during the perfusion period similarly demonstrated a marked difference between the rHir-coated and control graft segments (125 +/- 8 vs. 3 +/- 14 NIHU; p < 0.005).\nThese in vitro flow results illustrate that polyester grafts with covalently bound rHir can provide significant reductions in local thrombin concentration under physiologic flow conditions, and can serve as a foundation with which to understand the performance of these grafts when implanted in vivo under physiologic flow and shear rates.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of venous stasis ulceration, but the involvement of activated platelets and leukocyte-platelet aggregates has not been previously investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with venous stasis ulceration have increased platelet activation and a propensity toward formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates.\nBlood was drawn from the superficial veins of the leg just proximal to a venous stasis ulcer and from an antecubital vein in 14 patients with venous stasis ulceration. Blood was also drawn from the antecubital vein of 14 volunteers without evidence of venous disease. Whole-blood flow cytometry was used to analyze the samples before and after activation with a panel of agonists for evidence of platelet activation and the formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates.\nPatients with venous stasis ulceration had a greater number of monocyte-platelet aggregates in both the arm and leg samples than did the control subjects (p < 0.01). Furthermore, antecubital blood samples from patients with venous stasis ulceration stimulated with either thrombin-receptor agonist peptide, adenosine diphosphate, or phorbol myristate acetate formed more monocyte-platelet aggregates than did control samples (p < 0.05). No differences in platelet activation or neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation were noted among the three sample groups.\nPatients with venous stasis ulceration have an increase in the number of monocyte-platelet aggregates in systemic venous blood as well as in venous blood adjacent to a venous stasis ulcer, implicating the monocyte as the leukocyte involved in the pathogenesis of venous stasis ulceration. No association was identified between the presence of a venous stasis ulcer and either neutrophil-platelet aggregation or the activation of individual platelets. Because platelet activation is necessary for the formation of monocyte-platelet aggregates, these data also suggest that monocyte-platelet aggregation is a more sensitive marker for in vivo platelet activation than is the identification of individual activated platelets.",

    "abstract": "Effective treatment of primary subclavian vein thrombosis focuses on restoration of venous patency, relief of intrinsic stenosis, and decompression of the thoracic inlet. The appropriate method and timing for surgery, however, have not been not well defined. We conducted a study to determine an acceptable treatment approach.\nA retrospective review evaluated 11 patients seen at our institution in an 8-year period. Seven patients were male and four were female, with an average age of 30 years (range 15 to 54 years). Two patients who had symptomatic stenosis without occlusion were omitted from the study. All patients with occlusion received urokinase therapy and underwent surgical decompression within 5 days of thrombolytic therapy. Five percutaneous transluminal angioplasties were attempted before operative intervention. Eleven decompressions were performed, including nine first-rib resections and two scalenectomies. Five operative venous procedures, consisting of thrombectomy with patch closure (n = 3) and bypass (n = 2), and seven venolysis procedures were performed. All patients received coumadin for 3 to 6 months after the operation.\nUrokinase therapy established wide venous patency in nine of the 11 extremities treated, with the remaining two requiring thrombectomy for residual thrombus at the time of operation. One patient who underwent transluminal angioplasty before the operation had rethrombosis, and the remaining four showed no improvement in venous stenosis after the intervention. Eight of nine extremities treated by first-rib resection and one of two treated by scalenectomy were free of residual symptoms at follow-up.\nPreoperative use of percutaneous balloon angioplasty is ineffective and should be avoided in this setting. Surgical intervention within days of thrombolysis obviates the need for interim oral anticoagulation and enables patients to return to normal activity sooner.",

    "abstract": "Telemedicine coupled with digital photography could potentially improve the quality of outpatient wound care and decrease medical cost by allowing home care nurses to electronically transmit images of patients' wounds to treating surgeons. To determine the feasibility of this technology, we compared bedside wound examination by onsite surgeons with viewing digital images of wounds by remote surgeons.\nOver 6 weeks, 38 wounds in 24 inpatients were photographed with a Kodak DC50 digital camera (resolution 756 x 504 pixels/in2). Agreements regarding wound description (edema, erythema, cellulitis, necrosis, gangrene, ischemia, and granulation) and wound management (presence of healing problems, need for emergent evaluation, need for antibiotics, and need for hospitalization) were calculated among onsite surgeons and between onsite and remote surgeons. Sensitivity and specificity of remote wound diagnosis compared with bedside examination were calculated. Potential correlates of agreement, level of surgical training, certainty of diagnosis, and wound type were evaluated by multivariate analysis.\nAgreement between onsite and remote surgeons (66% to 95% for wound description and 64% to 95% for wound management) matched agreement among onsite surgeons (64% to 85% for wound description and 63% to 91% for wound management). Moreover, when onsite agreement was low (i.e., 64% for erythema) agreement between onsite and remote surgeons was similarly low (i.e., 66% for erythema). Sensitivity of remote diagnosis ranged from 78% (gangrene) to 98% (presence of wound healing problem), whereas specificity ranged from 27% (erythema) to 100% (ischemia). Agreement was influenced by wound type (p < 0.01) but not by certainty of diagnosis (p > 0.01) or level of surgical training (p > 0.01).\nWound evaluation on the basis of viewing digital images is comparable with standard wound examination and renders similar diagnoses and treatment in the majority of cases. Digital imaging for remote wound management is feasible and holds significant promise for improving outpatient vascular wound care.",

EDV was more accurate (95%) than peak systolic velocity (PSV), which had a maximal accuracy of 86% at a PSV > or =300 cm/sec, with low sensitivity (62%), but high specificity (100%). For CA, accurate velocity thresholds were not identified, but we subsequently noted that retrograde common hepatic artery flow direction from SMA collateral was highly predictive of severe CA stenosis or occlusion. Since publication of those findings, 243 mesenteric duplex scans were performed for clinical evaluation of suspected chronic mesenteric ischemia. Angiographic confirmation was available for a subset of 46. SMA and CA diameters were measured on lateral aortograms by observers blinded to the duplex results, and the original duplex diagnostic criteria were tested for accuracy. In addition, receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was performed on the velocity data to identify the most accurate velocity thresholds in the new data.\nDuplex was technically adequate in 98% of SMA, 96% of CA, and 89% of hepatic arteries, and arteriograms were adequate in 100% of SMA and 98% of CA. For the SMA, EDV > or =45 cm/sec again provided the best sensitivity (90%), specificity (91%), positive predictive value (90%), negative predictive value (91%), and overall accuracy (91%). As in the retrospective study, PSV > or =300 cm/sec provided low overall accuracy (81%), low sensitivity (60%), but high specificity (100%). Lowering the PSV threshold improved sensitivity but reduced accuracy. For CA, retrograde common hepatic artery flow direction was 100% predictive of severe CA stenosis or occlusion. Velocity data in CA provided accuracy not found in the original study. EDV > or =55 cm/sec or no flow signal had best overall accuracy (95%) with high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (100%). PSV > or =200 cm/sec or no signal also had excellent accuracy (93%), sensitivity (93%), and specificity (94%). In addition, three of four anatomic anomalies were correctly identified by duplex. These included one right hepatic and one common hepatic artery originating from the SMA, and one common celiacomesenteric trunk.\nThis validation analysis confirms that duplex velocity criteria are accurate in the identification of mesenteric occlusive disease. Retrograde common hepatic artery flow direction correctly predicts severe CA stenosis or occlusion. Duplex ultrasound may also identify mesenteric anatomic variants that can influence study interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Managed care whether through risk or through capitated contracts results in reduction in resources, reduced length of hospital stay, and reduced utilization of hospital resources (collectively referred to as resource reductions). These resource reductions will become even more noticeable as a greater proportion of Medicare patients who need vascular operations select a managed-care senior product. We examined the results of a 4-year experience with resource management in an academic vascular surgery practice during which best practice plans were developed and implemented.\nWe analyzed hospital cost data, which included both total hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, average units per operation for laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology services and operating room and direct hospital costs for 257 carotid endarterectomies performed over fiscal years (FY) 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 (6 month data) and 175 infrainguinal bypass procedures performed during the same period.\nFor carotid endarterectomy, length of stay decreased 66% over the 4-year period to an average of 2.07 days in FY97. Both radiology and pharmacy utilization were reduced after the first year of institution of best practice plans (56% and 32% respectively) with 4-year total reductions of 86% and 55% by FY97. The most notable changes included elimination of routine postoperative laboratory testing, use of aspirin rather than low-molecular-weight dextran, emphasis on oral rather than intravenous vasoactive drugs, and routine use of duplex scanning alone rather than angiography for diagnosis after FY94-95. The length of operating room time for carotid endarterectomy remained relatively constant from FY94 to FY97. As a result of these multiple factors, our study showed a 30% decrease in total average direct hospital costs for carotid endarterectomy from $9974 to $7002 in this 4-year period. Infrainguinal bypass graft procedures showed a progressive decrease in total cost of 28% for patients without complications to $15,186 but remained unchanged for those with complications. Laboratory use, pharmacy use, and radiology use were not significantly different.\nCase management for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and infrainguinal bypass grafting involving an integrated team of vascular surgeons, surgical house staff, a dedicated vascular nurse, and a social work case manager resulted in dramatic reductions both in length of stay and hospital resource utilization. As these costs decreased, operating room expenses assumed increasing importance. Operating room costs account for 60% of the direct costs of carotid endarterectomy and a comparable percentage for uncomplicated infrainguinal bypass grafting. Further substantial reductions in direct hospital costs will depend primarily on reductions in operating room costs, particularly those related to length of time in the operating room.",

Infrainguinal bypass graft procedures showed a progressive decrease in total cost of 28% for patients without complications to $15,186 but remained unchanged for those with complications. Laboratory use, pharmacy use, and radiology use were not significantly different.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effect of a critical pathway on postoperative length of stay and outcomes after infrainguinal bypass.\nA critical pathway for care of patients after infrainguinal bypass was introduced in December 1995 to coordinate postoperative care at our institution. We compared care of 67 consecutively treated patients before institution of the pathway with care of 69 consecutively treated patients with the critical pathway in place. Data collection was done by means of chart review. Univariate analyses were used to identify differences between prepathway and postpathway patients and to identify factors influencing postoperative length of stay. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors that influenced length of stay and to examine the effect of use of the pathway after adjusting for other factors.\nPatients on the pathway were similar to prepathway controls with respect to comorbid illnesses, vascular risk factors, indications for surgical treatment, type of conduit, and type of operation. Factors associated with longer postoperative stays included distal anastomoses to tibial rather than popliteal vessels (p = 0.02), preexisting cardiac disease (p = 0.005), postoperative complications (p = 0.0003), lower preoperative hematocrit (p = 0.01), and elevated preoperative creatinine level (p = 0.006). Overall, pathway patients had somewhat shorter postoperative lengths of stay (median value 7 days; range 2 to 29 days) than prepathway patients (median value 6 days; range 2 to 35; p = 0.01), and the two groups had similar frequencies of postoperative complications, readmission, and 6-month mortality. However, patients on the pathway were more likely to be discharged to an intermediate-care facility rather than directly home. After 12 patients with extraordinarily prolonged postoperative stays were excluded, multivariate analysis indicated that pathway patients had significantly shorter postoperative stays (p = 0.001). However, the difference was not significant if patients with extraordinarily long postoperative stays were included in the analysis (p = 0.28).\nUse of a critical pathway was associated with a modest decrease in postoperative length of stay for most patients. This was accomplished without an adverse effect on readmission, complication, or mortality rates. However, the decrease in stay may have been achieved primarily by discharging more patients to intermediate-care facilities. The pathway did not appear to have any effect when the subset of patients with extraordinarily long stays because of complex medical problems was included.",

    "abstract": "Both end-stage renal disease and diabetes have been demonstrated to have a negative effect on the outcome of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction, primarily because of increased perioperative morbidity and wound complications. This study was undertaken to determine whether the combination of these comorbid factors affects the outcome of distal arterial reconstruction.\nEighty-three distal lower extremity arterial bypasses originating from the femoral artery and terminating at the peroneal, anterior, or posterior tibial artery were performed on 76 patients over a 5-year period at a tertiary care medical center. Autogenous greater saphenous vein was used as the bypass conduit in all instances. Combined inflow and composite vein procedures were excluded.\nThere was one perioperative death, for a mortality rate of 1.2%. The diabetes mellitus (DM) plus end-stage renal disease (DM+ESRD) cohort displayed a significantly lower 1-year primary patency rate compared with the diabetes mellitus cohort, 53% versus 82% (p < 0.02). However, the limb salvage rate for the DM+ESRD and DM cohorts during the same time interval were not significantly different, 63% versus 84% (p < 0.06). The 52% 1-year survival rate for the DM+ESRD cohort was strikingly lower than the 90% 1-year survival rate for the DM cohort (p < 0.002).\nDespite the use of the optimal autogenous conduit, the combination of diabetes and end-stage renal disease can be expected to significantly decrease primary graft patency without affecting limb salvage.

    "abstract": "To identify variables predictive of the need for future vascular intervention in a leg contralateral to one currently undergoing infrainguinal bypass.\nWe reviewed the records of 450 consecutively treated patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass for occlusive disease to examine the outcome of a previously untreated contralateral leg. Patients with coexistent contralateral limb-threatening ischemia at the time of initial ipsilateral operation were excluded, as were patients with bilateral disease who underwent a staged contralateral procedure within 3 months of the ipsilateral operation. This yielded a study cohort of 383 patients with no anticipated intervention in the contralateral leg who were followed for a mean value of 38 months. Patient survival and subsequent intervention in the contralateral leg were examined with life-table and regression analysis.\nMean age of the patients was 68 years; 60% were men; 54% had diabetes; and 50% had coronary artery disease. The initial ipsilateral operation was performed for limb threat in 90% of instances. Twenty percent of patients subsequently needed intervention in the contralateral leg (infrainguinal bypass 83%, primary major amputation 17%). According to life-table analysis, 30% of patients needed intervention at 5 years, and the overall survival rate was 51% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis indicated that the need for future contralateral intervention was independently predicted with the following four risk factors: diabetes (relative risk [RR] 2.4x), coronary artery disease (RR 1.8x), lower initial ankle-brachial index (RR 2.1x with ankle-brachial index less than 0.7), and younger age (RR 2.2x if age less than 70 years). Regression models predicted the need for contralateral intervention for only 8% of patients at 5 years when none of these risk factors was present but for 67% when all risk factors were present.\nThe fate of the contralateral leg after infrainguinal bypass is affected by diabetes, coronary artery disease, contralateral ankle-brachial index, and age at initial ipsilateral bypass. The effect of these risk factors is additive in prediction of the likelihood of future intervention. Knowledge of these factors may help identify instances in which the contralateral greater saphenous vein will be important for future limb salvage and also determine which patients need more careful follow-up care.",

    "abstract": "Since its introduction in 1991, ultrasound guided compression repair of postcatheterization femoral artery pseudoaneurysms has been shown to be effective. Disadvantages of ultrasound guided compression repair include patient discomfort during compression, inability to treat noncompressible pseudoaneurysms, prolonged use of ultrasound equipment and personnel, limited success with patients being treated with anticoagulants, and some early recurrences. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate a new method of treating femoral pseudoaneurysms, percutaneous ultrasound guided thrombin injection.\nUnder duplex ultrasound guidance, a 22- or 25-gauge needle was percutaneously positioned within the pseudoaneurysm. Without compressing the pseudoaneurysm, 0.5 to 1 ml thrombin solution (1000 U/ml) was injected to induce thrombosis. Early in the study, the procedure was modified to allow more than one injection. After successful thrombosis, the patients were kept at rest in bed for at least 1 hour. Duplex ultrasound examination was repeated in 1 to 4 days. Distal pulses and ankle-brachial indexes were measured before and after the procedure.\nTwenty of 21 consecutive pseudoaneurysms were successfully treated with thrombin injection. Fifteen pseudoaneurysms thrombosed immediately (<20 seconds) after one injection. The other five had partial thrombosis after one injection and complete thrombosis immediately after a second injection. The one failure occurred in a patient who had only one injection and then underwent subsequent ultrasound guided compression repair, which failed. No patient required sedation or analgesia during thrombin injection. There were no procedure-related complications and no recurrences.\nPercutaneous ultrasound guided thrombin injection appears to be a safe and expeditious method for treating postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms. It has significant advantages with respect to ultrasound guided compression repair or surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "Since the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis Study (ACAS) established the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy at large academic centers, there have been two community-based studies of outcomes after this operation. The purpose of this study was to perform a statewide survey to evaluate postoperative morbidity and mortality after carotid endarterectomy among patients throughout Maine.\nA statewide registry was established to collect prospective data on carotid operations from January 1 to December 31, 1995. All surgeons and hospitals in the state were solicited to participate. All carotid endarterectomies were intended to be included; the only exclusion criterion was out-of-state residence. Comorbidities, preoperative studies, surgical indications, operative technique, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. State administrative data were used to assess registry coverage.\nTen of 17 hospitals participated, and 58% of all carotid endarterectomies performed in the state were included. Three hundred sixty-four operations were entered into the registry. Forty-four percent of the operations were performed for transient ischemic attack, 37% for asymptomatic stenosis, and 19% for stroke. The postoperative stroke rate was 2.5% with a total neurologic complication rate of 4.7% (transient ischemic attack and stroke). There was one postoperative death (mortality rate 0.3%). Patients with symptoms had a higher incidence of postoperative stroke (4.0% vs 0% asymptomatic; p < 0.05) and transient ischemic attacks (3.8% vs 0.8% asymptomatic). Hospital stroke rates varied from 0% to 7%. Stroke rate did not differ significantly between low-volume hospitals (2 to 28 patients/year, 3.3%) and high-volume hospitals (29 to 101 patients/year, 2.3%) or between low-volume surgeons (fewer than 11 operations/year, 1.7%) and high-volume surgeons (more than 12 operations/year, 2.4%). Among 26 reporting surgeons, stroke rate varied from 0% to 10%; the absolute number of strokes per surgeon varied between zero and two.\nThe statewide registry showed a postoperative stroke plus death rate of 2.8%, comparable with the NASCET and ACAS findings. Although this study had inherent limitations, the results from one state, including a variety of community practices, achieved results comparable with those of landmark trials.",

    "abstract": "Although classic type A and B aortic dissections have been well described, less is known about the natural history of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers of the thoracic aorta. This study differentiates penetrating ulcer from aortic dissection, determines the clinical features and natural history of these ulcers, and establishes appropriate correlates regarding optimal treatment.\nA retrospective review of patient records and imaging studies was conducted with 198 patients with initial diagnoses of aortic dissection (86 type A, 112 type B) at our institution from 1985 to 1997.\nOf the 198 patients, 15 (7.6%) were found to have a penetrating aortic ulcer on re-review of computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance images, angiograms, echocardiograms, intraoperative findings, or pathology reports. Two ulcers (13.3%) were located in the ascending aorta; the other 13 (86.7%) were in the descending aorta. In comparison with those with type A or B aortic dissection, patients with penetrating ulcer were older (mean age 76.6 years, p = 0.018); had larger aortic diameters (mean diameter 6.5 cm); had ulcers primarily in the descending aorta (13 of 15 patients, 86.7%); and more often had ulcers associated with a prior diagnosed or managed AAA (6 of 15 patients, 40.0%; p = 0.0001). Risk for aortic rupture was higher among patients with penetrating ulcers (40.0%) than patients with type A (7.0%) or type B (3.6%) aortic dissection (p = 0.0001).\nAccurate recognition and differentiation of penetrating ulcers from classic aortic dissection at initial presentation is critical for optimal treatment of these patients. For penetrating ulcer, the prognosis may be more serious than with classic type A or B aortic dissection. Surgical management is advocated for penetrating ulcers in the ascending aorta and for penetrating ulcers in the descending aorta that exhibit early clinical or radiologic signs of deterioration.",

    "abstract": "To determine the safety, effectiveness, and problems encountered with endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Initial experience with endoluminal stent grafts was examined and compared with outcome for a matched concurrent control group undergoing conventional operative repair of AAA.\nOver a 3-year period, 30 patients underwent attempts at endovascular repair of infrarenal AAA. Of the 28 (93%) successfully implanted endografts, 8 were tube endografts, 8 bifurcated grafts, and 12 aortouniiliac grafts combined with femorofemoral bypass. Most of the procedures were performed in the past year because the availability of bifurcated and aortoiliac endografts markedly expanded the percentage of patients with AAA who might be treated with endoluminal methods. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 44 months, with a mean value of 11 months.\nEndovascular procedures demonstrated significant advantages with respect to reduced blood loss (408 versus 1287 ml), use of an intensive care unit (0.1 versus 1.75 days), length of hospitalization (3.9 versus 10.3 days), and quicker recovery (11 versus 47 days). Although the total number of postoperative complications was identical for the two groups, the nature of the complications differed considerably. Local and vascular complications characteristic of endovascular repair could frequently be corrected at the time of the procedure and tended to be less severe than systemic or remote complications, which predominated among the open surgical repair group. On an intent-to-treat basis, 23 (77%) of the 30 AAAs were successfully managed with endoluminal repair. The seven (23%) failures were attributable to two immediate conversions caused by access problems, three persistent endoleaks, one late conversion caused by AAA expansion, and one late rupture.\nAlthough less definitive than those for conventional operations, these early results suggest that endovascular AAA repair offers considerable benefits for appropriate patients. The results justify continued application of this method of AAA repair, particularly in the treatment of older persons at high risk.",

    "abstract": "We describe a case of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with rupture 16 months after treatment by an endograft. A 76-year-old patient on Coumadin after aortic valve replacement had initially successful exclusion by stentgraft. There was no evidence of an endoleak seven months after stentgraft repair, although a computed tomography scan detected an enlargement of the aneurysm sac. Sixteen months after initial endograft surgery, rupture of the aneurysm occurred and we performed open emergency surgery. We treated the aneurysm by conventional technique, and the patient survived the rupture. This case emphasized the fact that patients after endograft AAA repair require a close follow-up. An expansion of the aneurysm sac after the procedure should signal failed exclusion, even if a computed tomography scan does not demonstrate an endoleak. Anticoagulation can be an important factor in failure after endoluminal graft treatment. Supravisceral aortic cross clamping is helpful in dealing with a stented aorta.",

    "abstract": "Sustained (late-phase) renovascular hypertension is associated with lower plasma renin activity than is the early phase. It is not clear to what extent this reduced plasma renin activity reflects diminished influence of the renin-angiotensin system. It also is not clear whether this change in the character of the disease influences the effectiveness of surgical removal of the renal artery stenosis in reversing hypertension. Using an animal model of sustained (> or =10 weeks after renal artery clipping) two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertension, we hypothesized that the magnitude of the depressor response to selective angiotensin II receptor blockade with losartan would reflect the influence of the renin-angiotensin system on hypertension and enable us to predict the depressor response to subsequent surgical removal of the clip.\nThe left renal arteries of 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150 to 200 gm were fitted with a silver clip (0.23 mm internal diameter). Systolic blood pressure was measured by means of tail-cuff plethysmography for 10 weeks. Rats were then given losartan orally (30 mg/kg a day) for 1 week while blood pressure was monitored. After an additional week to allow recovery, 13 rats underwent surgical unclipping, and seven underwent sham repair. Blood pressure again was monitored over the final week.\nAll two-kidney one-clip rats had hypertension 10 weeks after clipping (mean systolic blood pressure 206 +/- 10 mm Hg). Losartan decreased systolic blood pressure by 36 +/- 6 mm Hg. The response was variable, ranging from 3 to 66 mm Hg, and overall blood pressure did not normalize (170 +/- 8 mm Hg). Subsequent surgical unclipping decreased systolic blood pressure by 46 +/- 9 mm Hg. Again the response was variable, ranging from 10 to 99 mm Hg, although overall blood pressure did not normalize (164 +/- 7 mm Hg). The decrease in blood pressure after unclipping showed a high correlation with the blood pressure decrease after losartan administration (r = 0.861, p < 0.001). Resting plasma renin activity (before intervention) was 16 +/- 4 ng angiotensin I per milliliter per hour and was not predictive of the response to either losartan or surgical unclipping. The rats subjected to sham operations had no statistically significant changes in blood pressure. Histologic evaluation showed patent renal arteries without appreciable stenosis or intimal hyperplasia after removal of the clips.\nIn sustained two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertension, the depressor response to angiotensin II receptor blockade is attenuated, suggesting that late-phase hypertension becomes increasingly angiotensin II-independent. In our model, the extent to which sustained renovascular hypertension becomes refractory to 7 days of angiotensin II blockade is highly predictive of the ultimate outcome of surgical repair of renal artery stenosis.",

The decrease in blood pressure after unclipping showed a high correlation with the blood pressure decrease after losartan administration (r = 0.861, p < 0.001). Resting plasma renin activity (before intervention) was 16 +/- 4 ng angiotensin I per milliliter per hour and was not predictive of the response to either losartan or surgical unclipping. The rats subjected to sham operations had no statistically significant changes in blood pressure. Histologic evaluation showed patent renal arteries without appreciable stenosis or intimal hyperplasia after removal of the clips.",

    "abstract": "Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia remains a significant cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure. Prior studies have identified several genes with altered expression within the hyperplastic region at the downstream polytetrafluoroethylene arterial anastomosis as compared with normal arteries. The purpose of the current study was to determine the sequence of early gene-related events at the distal anastomosis of an in vivo prosthetic arterial graft model. Messenger RNA (mRNA) differential display was used to screen for alterations in gene expression between anastomotic sites and control arterial segments.\nSix carotid interposition 6-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were placed in mongrel dogs, with the intervening carotid artery segment serving as the baseline control. Five days after graft implantation, the distal anastomotic artery segments were harvested and total RNA was isolated from both the intervening normal arteries and anastomotic segments. Differential mRNA display was used to identify candidate complementary DNA (cDNA) clones with expression that differed in anastomotic segments as compared with normal intervening arteries. Northern blot analysis confirmed alteration of gene expression. The cDNA clones were sequenced, and gene databases were searched. Novel sequences were used as probes for screening human cDNA libraries.\nApproximately 7000 mRNA species were screened, and 26 candidate clones were obtained. Northern blot analysis showed altered gene expression in 10 (38%) of the clones, undetectable signals in 13 (50%), and nonregulation in 3 (12%). Seven clones with 92% homology at the nucleotide level to human alpha1 (III) procollagen gene and novel sequence were expressed only at the distal anastomosis. A clone representing apolipoprotein J and a novel sequence had increased expression at the distal anastomosis of 364% +/- 236% and 156% +/- 47%, respectively (mean percentage, control +/- standard deviation).\nThese studies identified genes with expressions that increased or were exclusive to the distal anastomosis of healing prosthetic arterial grafts in an in vivo prosthetic arterial graft model. Type III collagen may contribute significantly to the composition of the extracellular matrix associated with intimal hyperplasia by increasing lesion volume. Apolipoprotein J, through its association with proteases, may modulate some of the matrix changes seen early after grafting.",

    "abstract": "The precise role played by hemodynamics, particularly wall shear stress, in the development and progression of vascular disease remains unclear, in large part because of a lack of in vivo studies with humans. Although technical challenges remain for noninvasively imaging wall shear stresses in humans, vascular anatomy can be imaged with sufficiently high resolution to allow reconstruction of three-dimensional models for computational hemodynamic studies. In this paper we present an entirely noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol that provides carotid bifurcation geometry and flow rates from which the in vivo hemodynamics can be computed. Maps of average, oscillatory, and gradients of wall shear stress are presented for two normal human subjects, and their data are compared with those computed for an idealized carotid bifurcation model.\nAn MRI protocol was developed to acquire all necessary image data in scan times suitable for patient studies. Three-dimensional models of the carotid bifurcation lumen were reconstructed from serial black blood MR images of two normal volunteers. Common and internal carotid artery flow rate waveforms were determined from MRI phase-contrast velocity imaging in the same subjects and were used to impose fully developed velocity boundary conditions for the computational model. Subject-specific time-resolved velocities and wall shear stresses were then computed with a finite element-based Navier-Stokes equation solver.\nModels reconstructed from in vivo MRI of two subjects showed obvious differences in branch angle, bulb size and extent, and three-dimensional curvature. Maps of a variety of wall shear stress indices showed obvious qualitative differences in patterns between the in vivo models and between the in vivo models and the idealized model. Secondary, helical flow patterns, induced primarily by the asymmetric and curved in vivo geometries, were found to play a key role in determining the resulting wall shear stress patterns. The use of in vivo flow rate waveforms was found to play a minor but noticeable role in some of the wall shear stress behavior observed.\nConventional \"averaged\" carotid bifurcation models mask interesting hemodynamic features observed in realistic models derived from noninvasive imaging of normal human subjects. Observation of intersubject variations in the in vivo wall shear stress patterns supports the notion that more conclusive evidence regarding the role of hemodynamics in vascular disease may be derived from such individual studies. The techniques presented here, when combined with subject-specific MRI measurements of carotid artery plaque thickness and composition, provide the tools necessary for entirely noninvasive, prospective, in vivo human studies of hemodynamics and the relationship of hemodynamics to vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The study objective was to apply laparoscopic techniques to conventional bypass procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nFrom October 1995 to August 1997, we performed seven iliofemoral (IFB), five unilateral aortofemoral (UAFB), and 11 aortobifemoral (AFB) bypass procedures and one aortic endarterectomy (TEA) totally laparoscopic. A transabdominal approach with pneumoperitoneum was preferred, and only laparoscopic vascular instruments were used. Endoscopic intervention followed principles of vascular surgery. As in open surgery, we used Dacron grafts and polypropylene sutures.\nTwenty procedures were carried out totally laparoscopic; four conversions to open surgery were necessary. Severe complications included one postoperative respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support for four days, and one iliac vein lesion with subsequent open surgery. Mean operating time was 258 +/- 49 minutes for IFB, 218 +/- 54 minutes for UAFB, 279 +/- 69 minutes for AFB, and 290 minutes for aortic TEA. Mean blood loss was 92 +/- 49 ml for IFB, 390 +/- 316 ml for UAFB, 563 +/- 516 ml for AFB, and 100 ml for aortic TEA. Mean postoperative stay was 7.4 days for IFB, 7.8 days for UAFB, and 10.1 days for AFB. After the aortic TEA, the patient was discharged on day 6. At control examination all grafts were patent; two patients had mild claudication because of one progressive disease and one distal suture stenosis.\nLaparoscopic vascular surgery for aortoiliac occlusive disease is feasible, safe, and effective. At the beginning, a cooperation between experienced laparoscopists and vascular surgeons is needed to overcome procedural challenge, because operating time and conversion rate decrease with growing experience. The advantages observed in the majority of our patients were minimal tissue trauma, decreased blood loss, and faster postoperative recovery when compared with patients who had open aortic surgery at our institution. Further evidence has to be gained by clinical trials to define the role of laparoscopic vascular surgery for aortoiliac occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "An in vivo model of acute deep venous thrombosis was developed in rats to assess the role of venous thrombosis and outflow obstruction in recanalization and development of secondary wall changes.\nThe left femoral veins of male Sprague-Dawley rats were thrombosed either by means of proximal ligation (obstruction, group A, n = 38) or by means of temporary 24-hour occlusion with a microvascular clamp (unobstructed, group B, n = 20). Right femoral veins served as controls. The rats were killed at intervals over 5 weeks. Wall thickness was compared among groups by means of counting of cells on representative sections through the midvein area. Thrombi were indirectly quantitated with a radiolabeled fibrinogen assay in a parallel series of rats.\nControl veins showed no evidence of cellular or structural changes. Early thrombus extension was seen in group A (peak at day 4) followed by recanalization after 2 weeks. Group A veins had marked wall thickening (27 +/- 7 vs 6 +/- 2 cells, p < 0.01, peak at 10 days) consisting of smooth muscle-type, neointimal, and medial cellular proliferations. Within 2 to 3 weeks, local neovascular channels had grown to bypass the outflow obstruction, and resumption of normal cephalad flow was seen. At the same time neointimal proliferation regressed, but medial cellular growth persisted, resulting in chronic wall thickening (11 +/- 3 vs 5 +/- 1 cells, p < 0.01, after 21 days). In contrast, group B veins exhibited no thrombus extension, had significantly less wall thickening (13 +/- 2 vs 5 +/- 1 cells, p < 0.01, peak at 4 days), and did not induce growth of local collateral blood vessels. Within 2 weeks, group B veins regained normal appearance and resumed normal flow.\nThrombosis of rat femoral veins without chronic obstruction results in rapid lysis of thrombus and transient proliferative changes. In contrast, thrombosis with chronic outflow obstruction results in delayed recanalization, early extension of thrombus, and development of vigorous and persistent proliferative cellular responses. Thrombus-induced chronic wall thickening may be an important factor in development of postthrombotic venous insufficiency.",

    "results": "Control veins showed no evidence of cellular or structural changes. Early thrombus extension was seen in group A (peak at day 4) followed by recanalization after 2 weeks. Group A veins had marked wall thickening (27 +/- 7 vs 6 +/- 2 cells, p < 0.01, peak at 10 days) consisting of smooth muscle-type, neointimal, and medial cellular proliferations. Within 2 to 3 weeks, local neovascular channels had grown to bypass the outflow obstruction, and resumption of normal cephalad flow was seen. At the same time neointimal proliferation regressed, but medial cellular growth persisted, resulting in chronic wall thickening (11 +/- 3 vs 5 +/- 1 cells, p < 0.01, after 21 days). In contrast, group B veins exhibited no thrombus extension, had significantly less wall thickening (13 +/- 2 vs 5 +/- 1 cells, p < 0.01, peak at 4 days), and did not induce growth of local collateral blood vessels. Within 2 weeks, group B veins regained normal appearance and resumed normal flow.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the results and complications of stents placed for initially unsuccessful or complicated iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), the effect of location (external iliac or common iliac) on outcome, and the influence of superficial femoral artery patency on benefit.\nFrom 1992 through 1997, 350 patients underwent iliac artery PTA at the authors' institutions. Of this group, 88 patients (88 arteries) had one or more stents placed after PTA (140 stents in total) for residual stenosis or pressure gradient (63 patients), iliac dissection (12 patients), long-segment occlusion (10 patients), or recurrent stenosis (3 patients). Thirty patients required the placement of more than one stent. The indications for PTA in these 88 patients were claudication (48 patients) and limb-threatening ischemia (40 patients). Forty-seven patients had stents placed in the common iliac, 29 patients had stents placed in the external iliac, and 12 patients had stents placed in both. Seventy-one arteries (81%) were stenotic, and 17 (19%) were occluded before PTA. Sixty-six arteries were treated by interventional radiologists, 15 by a vascular surgeon, and 7 jointly.\nCriteria for success included (1) increase of at least one clinical category of chronic limb ischemia from baseline or satisfactory wound healing, (2) maintenance of an ankle/brachial index increase of more than 0.10 above the preprocedure index, and (3) residual angiographic stenosis less than 25% and, for patients with pressure gradient measurements, a residual gradient less than 10 mm Hg.\nStent placement was accomplished in all 88 patients with 16 (18%) major complications. Mean follow-up was 17 months (range, 3 to 48 months). By life-table analysis, success was 75% at 1 year, 62% at 2 years, and 57% at 3 years. No cardiovascular risk factor or independent variable was statistically significant in predicting success. There was no difference in success rates for common iliac or external iliac lesions. Superficial femoral artery patency did not correlate with outcome.\nAlthough stents can eliminate residual lesions and arterial dissection, these patients are likely to require adjuvant or subsequent procedures to attain clinical success. By controlling the PTA complication and treating the emergent problem, stents may allow for subsequent elective intervention.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to compare complication rate, primary patency, and cost of stent deployment with direct surgical reconstruction for the treatment of severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nFrom March 1, 1992, to May 31, 1996, 119 patients receiving treatment for aortoiliac occlusive disease were analyzed after exclusions. Sixty-five patients had stent deployment and 54 patients had surgical reconstruction. Data were evaluated within and between the groups by univariate and multivariate logistic regression, life-table, t-test, and cross tabulation with chi2 analysis.\nThere was no significant difference between the groups with regard to demographic features or presenting symptoms (all p values > 0.07). Incidence of procedure-related complications was similar (p = 0.30). However, there were more systemic complications in the surgery group (15 versus 2; RR = 5.5, p < 0.01) and more vascular complications in the stent group (16 versus 3; RR = 12, p < 0.002). Incidence and type of late complications were not appreciably different (all p values > 0.05). Cumulative primary patency rate of bypass grafts was significantly better than stented iliac arteries at 18 months (93% versus 77%), 30 months (93% versus 68%) and 42 months (93% versus 68%); p = 0.002, log rank. Multivariate analysis identified female gender (RR = 4.6, p = 0.03), ipsilateral SFA occlusion (RR = 5.6, p = 0.01), procedure-related vascular complication (RR = 9.7, p = 0.002), and hypercholesterolemia (RR = 5.0, p = 0.02) as independent predictors of bypass graft or stent thrombosis. Mean total hospital cost per limb treated did not differ significantly between surgery and stent deployment groups ($9383 versus $8626, respectively; p = 0.66, t-test).\nTreatment of severe aortoiliac occlusive disease by surgical reconstruction or stent deployment has a similar complication rate. Mean hospital cost per limb treated is essentially equal. However, cumulative primary patency rate of bypass grafts is superior to stents. Therefore, considering the elements of cost and patency, surgical revascularization has greater value. The benchmark for cost-effective treatment of severe aortoiliac occlusive disease is direct surgical reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Because the natural history of carotid body tumors is believed to be unpredictable, immediate surgical removal has been recommended. The present study reviews our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of these uncommon lesions.\nThe medical records of patients who appeared for treatment with carotid body tumors between 1981 and 1997 were reviewed. Patients demographics, mode of presentation, imaging and treatment modalities, Shamblin classification, and neurologic complications (stroke, cranial nerve injuries) were analyzed.\nOver the past 16 years, 31 patients with 32 carotid body tumors have been evaluated, with an average follow-up of 3.2 years. The patients were arbitrarily classified into two groups on the basis of the mode of detection. Seventy percent (23 of 32) of the tumors discovered on clinical or self-examination were classified as Group 1; 28% (9 of 32) of the tumors detected during duplex scanning for carotid artery disease (8) or MRI (1) were classified as Group 2. The mean size of chemodectomas found on palpation (4.3 +/- 1.7 cm) was larger than that of those detected by duplex ultrasound (2.7 +/- 1.0 cm; p < 0.05, by paired t test). Preoperative embolization was successfully performed in 5 of 6 instances of large tumors; the remaining patient suffered a procedure-related stroke. Thirty-one carotid body tumors were resected. In one case, the tumor was felt by the primary surgeon to be too small (0.9 x 0.7 cm on duplex scan) to warrant immediate excision; this patient is being followed by periodic duplex scanning. Five neurologic complications were noted in Group 1, one after preoperative embolization and four after surgery. One cranial nerve injury occurred in Group 2. One patient had a large recurrent chemodectoma with clinical evidence of metastatic disease.\nThe increasing use of sophisticated imaging modalities may allow earlier discovery of carotid body tumors before they can be clinically detected. Resection of carotid body tumors of all sizes in appropriate surgical candidates remains the standard of care. Unfortunately, resection of even small tumors is associated with a low but constant incidence of neurologic complications.",

    "abstract": "Although the fact is well accepted that deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins can lead to the post-thrombotic (postphlebitic) syndrome, the significance of isolated calf DVT on the development of late venous sequelae and physiologic calf dysfunction is unknown. The purpose of this study was to review the outcome of 58 limbs with isolated calf DVT and report the clinical, physiologic, and imaging results up to 6 years after the onset of DVT.\nThe study consisted of 58 limbs of 54 patients in whom isolated calf vein DVT was diagnosed between 1990 and 1995. Proximal propagation of clot, lysis of thrombi, and development of symptomatic pulmonary emboli were examined. Of the patients, 28 received anticoagulation therapy, and 26 did not, but they had follow-up with serial duplex scans. At late follow-up 1 to 6 years later (median, 3 years), 23 patients were examined for the post-thrombotic syndrome, and all 23 underwent clinical examination, color-flow duplex scanning, and air plethysmography.\nProximal propagation of DVT from the calf veins into the popliteal or thigh veins occurred in 2 of 49 cases (4%) within 2 weeks of diagnosis. No patient had clinically overt pulmonary emboli develop regardless of whether anticoagulation therapy was received or not. The most common site for calf DVT was the peroneal vein (71%). Complete lysis of calf thrombi was found in 88% of the cases by 3 months. At 3 years, 95% of the patients were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and 5% had discoloration of the limb. No ulcers occurred. By air plethysmography, physiologic abnormalities were found in 27% of the cases, which was not significantly different from normal controls. Valvular reflux by duplex scanning of the calf vein segment with DVT was found in 2 of 23 cases (9%). However, reflux in at least one venous segment not involved with DVT was found in 7 of 23 cases (30%), which was higher than, but not statistically different from, normal controls, with reflux occurring in 5 of 26 cases (19%).\nIsolated calf vein DVT leads to few early complications (ie, clot propagation, pulmonary emboli) and few adverse sequelae at 3 years. The peroneal vein is most commonly involved and should be a part of the routine screening for DVT. Lysis of clot usually occurs by 3 months. Although valvular reflux rarely is found in the affected calf vein at 3 years, reflux may be found in adjacent uninvolved veins in approximately 30% of the cases. The question of whether this will lead to future sequelae, such as ulceration, will require longer follow-up.",

No patient had clinically overt pulmonary emboli develop regardless of whether anticoagulation therapy was received or not. The most common site for calf DVT was the peroneal vein (71%). Complete lysis of calf thrombi was found in 88% of the cases by 3 months. At 3 years, 95% of the patients were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and 5% had discoloration of the limb. No ulcers occurred. By air plethysmography, physiologic abnormalities were found in 27% of the cases, which was not significantly different from normal controls. Valvular reflux by duplex scanning of the calf vein segment with DVT was found in 2 of 23 cases (9%). However, reflux in at least one venous segment not involved with DVT was found in 7 of 23 cases (30%), which was higher than, but not statistically different from, normal controls, with reflux occurring in 5 of 26 cases (19%).",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis associated with central venous catheters is a significant cause of device failure, morbidity, and loss of access sites. We hypothesized that central vein thrombosis is caused by catheter injury to the vein wall and that it can be reduced by stabilizing the catheter tip. To test these hypotheses, we studied central vein catheters in a porcine model. Test catheters had a silicone-encased stainless steel loop at the indwelling end that contacted the vein wall and stabilized the catheter tip in the center of the vessel.\nSealed silicon elastic (Silastic) catheters (3.2 mm outer diameter) with and without a stabilizing loop were inserted via the external jugular vein into the superior vena cava just above the right atrium. Animals were killed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and the vena cava was inspected for the presence of thrombus and entrapment of the catheter tip.\nIn control animals mural thrombus developed at the site of the catheter tip. This thrombus organized by invasion of macrophages and smooth muscle cells, eventually forming a lesion similar to intimal hyperplasia. Lesion cross-sectional area was significantly smaller in animals with loop catheters than in control animals at 2 weeks (1.2 +/- 1.3 vs 34.5 +/- 23.9 mm2; p = 0.05) and 4 weeks (2.8 +/- 0.3 vs 13.9 +/- 5.8 mm2; p < 0.05). By 8 weeks the vena cava was nearly occluded in most animals and the catheter tip was entrapped in this lesion in all cases. Test catheters eliminated the injury process for up to 8 weeks (p < 0.01, chi2 control vs loop catheter entrapment). Very little injury response was found where the loop contacted the vein wall, and the catheter tip was free of thrombus in all cases.\nMural thrombosis at the tip of indwelling central catheters is caused by chronic mechanical venous wall injury. Vessel injury and the resulting thrombosis can be prevented by a catheter modification that stabilizes the tip. Such a catheter may significantly reduce catheter malfunction and morbidity associated with these devices.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the long-term growth and outcomes of vascular surgery procedures over time. Trends in the use of three major vascular surgery procedures by a general population-lower extremity arterial bypass (LEAB), carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA)-are described. The extent to which these procedures are being performed in low-, moderate-, and high-volume hospitals is examined.\nCalifornia hospital discharge records for LEAB, CEA, AAA, lower extremity angioplasty, coronary angioplasty, and coronary bypass surgery (CABG) were studied in all non-federal hospitals between 1982 and 1994. The data were age- and sex-adjusted to describe procedure growth. In-hospital mortality rates for LEAB, CEA, and AAA are related to overall hospital procedure volume, using logistic regression to control for risk factors and time trends.\nGrowth in the number of vascular procedures performed in California was modest between 1982 and 1994, with no age-adjusted growth. Lower extremity angioplasty grew considerably in the 1980s and has since plateaued. Annual in-hospital death rates declined for all procedures except ruptured AAA. Comparing the two 5-year periods of 1982-1986 and 1990-1994, in-hospital death rates decreased from 4.2% to 3.3% for LEAB, from 9.2% to 6.2% for unruptured AAA, and from 1.6% to 1.0% for CEA (p < 0.0001). The odds of dying for patients treated in high-volume hospitals for LEAB and CEA procedures compared with patients treated in hospitals performing fewer than 20 procedures in a year were 66.7% (p = < 0.0001) and 66.1% (p < 0.0001), respectively. For patients with ruptured and unruptured AAA procedures, the odds of dying in hospitals with at least 50 AAA procedures in a year were 49.1% (p < 0.0001) and 83.8% (p = 0.016), respectively, compared with the odds of dying in low-volume hospitals.\nIn-hospital mortality rates for CEA, LEAB, and unruptured AAA have been significantly decreasing over time. Mortality is inversely related to hospital volume and directly related to patient age and emergency status. Mortality trends over time for ruptured AAA remains unchanged; however, mortality is less in high-volume hospitals. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has not had an impact on rates for LEAB.",

This study documents the natural history of ARAS in patients who require aortic reconstruction.\nTwo hundred patients who required aortic reconstruction from 1985 to 1990 for indications other than hypertension or renal salvage were identified. ARAS was not repaired. Preoperative angiograms were available for 171 of 200 patients and were reviewed for renal artery stenosis. Patients were assessed for atherosclerotic risk factors, survival, preoperative and follow-up blood pressure, serum creatinine level, antihypertensive medication usage, and need for dialysis.\nThe mean duration of follow-up was 6.3 years. Twenty-four of 171 patients (14%) had preoperative unilateral 70% to 99% diameter reduction ARAS, and eight (5%) had bilateral 70% to 99% ARAS. Clinical features associated with > or =70% ARAS included coronary artery disease, increased age, and a diagnosis of hypertension (p < 0.05). Patients with > or =70% ARAS did not have a decreased 7-year survival rate (66% vs 84%; p = 0.10) but had higher systolic blood pressures (153 +/- 25 vs 138 +/- 30 mm Hg; p < 0.05) as well as increased numbers of antihypertensive medications at follow-up (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs 0.7 +/- 1; p < 0.05). The mean serum creatinine level (1.1 +/- 0.3 preoperative vs 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dl; p = NS) was not increased. One patient (0.58%) with polycystic kidney disease and minimal renal artery stenosis required dialysis.\nHigh-grade ARAS in patients who are undergoing infrarenal aortic reconstruction is associated at late follow-up with increased systolic blood pressure and a need for increased numbers of antihypertensive medications, but not decreased survival rate, dialysis dependence, or an increase in serum creatinine level. These data do not support renal artery repair in patients with ARAS who undergo infrarenal aortic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Because isolated common iliac artery aneurysms are infrequent, are difficult to detect and treat, and have traditionally been associated with high operative mortality rates in reported series, we analyzed the outcomes of operative repair of 31 isolated common iliac artery aneurysms in 21 patients to ascertain morbidity and mortality rates with contemporary techniques of repair.\nA retrospective review study was conducted in a university teaching hospital and a Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Perioperative mortality and operative morbidity rates were examined in 17 men and four women with isolated common iliac artery aneurysms between 1984 and 1997. Ages ranged from 38 to 87 years (mean 69 +/- 8 years). Slightly more than half of the cases were symptomatic, with abdominal pain, neurologic, claudicative, genitourinary, or hemodynamic symptoms. One aneurysm had ruptured and one was infected. There was one iliac artery-iliac vein fistula. All aneurysms involved the common iliac artery. Coexistent unilateral or bilateral external iliac aneurysms were present in four patients; there were three accompanying internal iliac aneurysms. Overall, 52% of patients had unilateral aneurysms and 48% had bilateral aneurysms. Aneurysms ranged in maximal diameter from 2.5 to 12 cm (mean 5.6 +/- 2 cm). No patients were unavailable for follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years.\nNineteen patients underwent direct operative repair of isolated iliac aneurysms. One patient had placement of an endoluminal covered stent graft; another patient at high risk had percutaneous placement of coils within the aneurysm to occlude it in conjunction with a femorofemoral bypass graft. Patients with bilateral aneurysms underwent aortoiliac or aortofemoral interposition grafts, whereas unilateral aneurysms were managed with local interposition grafts. There were no deaths in the perioperative period. Only one elective operation (5%) resulted in a significant complication, compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. The patient treated with the covered stent required femorofemoral bypass when the stent occluded 1 week after the operation. The patient treated with coil occlusion of a large common iliac aneurysm died 2 years later when the aneurysm ruptured.\nIsolated iliac artery aneurysms can be managed with much lower mortality and morbidity rates than aneurysm previously been reported by using a systematic operative approach. Percutaneous techniques may be less durable and effective than direct surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "Turf issues exist largely because of emerging endovascular technologies. Vascular surgeons must develop skills with catheters, guidewires, and imaging techniques. Turf battles will result from unrestrained competition. Center/partnerships between vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists will minimize these turf battles and facilitate cross-training, which will improve the functioning of both specialists. These center/partnerships will, therefore, provide the best, most cost-effective care. Finally, all specialists who are interested in vascular disease must recognize the dangers of overproduction of competing specialists. More importantly, their leaders and specialty societies must make a serious effort to deal with this problem fairly.",

    "abstract": "Recently, William W. McGuire, Chief Executive Officer of United Health-Care, emphasized that the key from the patient's viewpoint is access. He stated, \"We use the term gateway rather than gatekeeper.\" He emphasizes the importance of direct access of the patient to the right physician, whether it be a specialist or a generalist. Although some health care strategists believe that patients should initially see a generalist before receiving specialty care, this approach may not save dollars in the long run. Managed care is likely to have a major impact on vascular surgeons. Currently, business purchasing cooperatives are one model for containing costs of expensive invasive procedures among the working population. Such cooperatives are likely to achieve a stronger penetration in the health care market and to negotiate aggressively for packaged fee contracts for specialized cardiovascular care and procedures. Because the vast majority of vascular patients are more than 65 years of age, the movement of Medicare toward managed care may also affect vascular surgery in a major way. If vascular surgeons are to survive financially in the managed care environment, they must continue to provide evidence-based solutions to clinical problems at a reasonable cost and with good outcomes. They must also understand that involvement in the administrative and political leadership of health care is essential to maintaining some influence on the future reimbursement for our services.",

    "abstract": "A 22-year-old man came to our institution with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. His history included an abdominal gunshot, with aortic and multiple intestinal perforations, 9 months before. At the time of the original injury, he was treated elsewhere by primary closure of the aortic laceration and multiple intestinal resections. An aortic pseudoaneurysm was revealed by means of an angiogram of the descending aorta. Conventional surgical procedures were deemed not feasible because of previous abdominal operations, so a balloon-expandable bifurcated endoprosthesis was constructed and inserted into the terminal aorta through the femoral approach, with resolution of the abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty (CA) has been suggested to be a safer and more cost-effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the management of symptomatic severe internal carotid artery (ICA) disease.\nThe study was conducted as a prospective consecutive randomized trial of CEA versus CA for symptomatic severe ICA disease in a university teaching hospital. All patients were assessed before and after surgery by a neurologist. The study consisted of 23 patients with focal carotid territory symptoms and severe ICA stenosis (> 70%) who were randomized to either CEA or CA. However, only 17 had received their allocated treatment before trial suspension. CEA with patching or CA with stenting were used as interventions. The main outcome measures were death or disabling or nondisabling stroke within 30 days.\nAll 10 CEA operations proceeded without complication, but 5 of the 7 patients who underwent CA had a stroke (P=.0034), 3 of which were disabling at 30 days.\nAfter referral, the Data Monitoring Committee invoked the stopping rule and the trial was suspended. The investigators and the Ethics Committee subsequently concluded that the trial could not be restarted--even in an amended format-primarily because of problems with informed consent. We review many of the ethical dilemmas encountered in the performance of this study. If future trials do suggest a selected role for CA, it is essential that both the inclusion and the exclusion criteria are fully documented.",

The effect of HSPGs, applied in a periadventitial gel, on neointimal formation was assessed 14 days after balloon catheter injury of rabbit carotid arteries. Their effect on SMC phenotype and proliferation was measured by point-counting morphometry of the cytoplasmic volume fraction of myofilaments (Vvmyo) and 3H-thymidine incorporation in SMCs in culture.\nArterial HSPGs (680 microg) reduced neointimal formation by 35% at 14 days after injury (P=.029), whereas 2000 microg of the low-molecular-weight heparin Enoxaparin was ineffective. HSPGs at 34 microg/mL maintained subconfluent primary cultured SMCs with the same high Vvmyo (52.1%+/-13.8%) after 5 days in culture as did cells freshly isolated from the arterial wall (52.1%+/-15.1%). In contrast, 100 microg/mL Enoxaparin was ineffective in preventing phenotypic change over this time period (Vvmyo 38.9%+/-14.6%, controls 35.9%+/-12.8%). HSPGs also inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation into primary cultured SMCs with an ID50 value of 0.4 microg/mL compared with a value of 14 microg/mL for Enoxaparin (P< .01).\nWhen used periadventitially in the rabbit arterial injury model, natural arterial HSPGs are effective inhibitors of neointimal formation. In vitro, the HSPGs maintain SMCs in a quiescent state by inhibiting phenotypic change and DNA synthesis. This study suggests that HSPGs may be a natural agent for the treatment of clinical restenosis.",

    "abstract": "A new protective method against the spinal cord ischemia that occurs during aortic clamping was investigated in dogs. Oxygenated blood containing prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was administered at the clamped aortic segment, and the effect was evaluated by measurement of the sensory evoked spinal potential (SESP).\nIn 30 dogs, a thoracotomy was made with dissection of the thoracic aorta. After intravenous heparin (100 units/kg) was administered, the proximal and distal descending thoracic aortas were cross-clamped for 60 minutes. Group A (n=10) received oxygenated blood at the rate of 1.0 ml/kg/min. Groups B (n=10) and C (n=10) received oxygenated blood at the same rate, with PGE1 at the dosage of 25 and 50 ng/kg/min, respectively. The infusion was continuously administered throughout the entire period of ischemia. SESP was measured with epidural electrodes before clamping, 10 and 60 minutes after clamping, and 10 and 60 minutes after declamping. Neurologic outcome was assessed at 24 hours after the operation and graded according to the method of Tarlov.\nThere was no significant hemodynamic change in any group. At 60 minutes after damping and at 10 and 60 minutes after declamping, the amplitude of SESP was lower than that at preclamping in groups A and B (p < 0.05). At 60 minutes after damping and at 10 and 60 minutes after declamping, the SESP was more markedly decreased in group A compared with groups B and C. Regarding postoperative neurologic outcome, the dogs with SESP amplitude of more than 50% of the preclamping control value at 60 minutes after clamping showed neither paralysis nor paraplegia. Seven of nine dogs with less than 50% SESP amplitude showed neurogenic deficit. In a comparison of groups A, B, and C, the Tarlov score for group A dogs was significantly lower than that for group C dogs (p < 0.05).\nIn this model, PGE1 administration at the rate of 50 ng/kg/min showed sufficient spinal cord protection against ischemia without a decrease in the blood pressure. Further studies are needed to determine the dose that will provide the maximal protective effect and to determine the maximum duration of ischemia against which PGE1 shows protective effects.",

Regarding postoperative neurologic outcome, the dogs with SESP amplitude of more than 50% of the preclamping control value at 60 minutes after clamping showed neither paralysis nor paraplegia. Seven of nine dogs with less than 50% SESP amplitude showed neurogenic deficit. In a comparison of groups A, B, and C, the Tarlov score for group A dogs was significantly lower than that for group C dogs (p < 0.05).",

    "abstract": "To determine the utility and accuracy of helical CT angiography (CTA) in the evaluation of carotid artery stenosis.\nA comparison of CTA and conventional arteriogram was performed in 53 patients undergoing evaluation for carotid artery stenosis. Ninety-six carotid systems were evaluable. CTA stenosis was determined by the percent of area reduction seen on axial images through the level of greatest narrowing. MIP images were used to identify the point of maximal stenosis and to visualize overall vascular anatomy. The percent diameter stenosis was measured on conventional arteriograms using strict North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) criteria.\nSignificant correlation was found between CTA and arteriography (NASCET method R=0.87, ECST method R=0.87, p < 0.001). Using NASCET >60% as an indicator for disease, CTA had a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 90%, accuracy of 89%, negative predictive value of 88%, and positive predictive value of 89%. CTA identified plaque characteristics such as ulcerations (8), occlusion (10), fatty plaques (22), calcifications (48), and fibrosis (2). CTA underestimated 2 cases of short segment stenoses because of volume averaging, but this discrepancy was detected by duplex scan. No complications or renal dysfunction occurred with CTA; 1 patient became symptomatic during arteriography, necessitating termination of the procedure.\nCTA is a safe, non-invasive technique that precisely measures carotid artery area reduction and highly correlates to conventional arteriography. With this new technology, the current standards for carotid artery imaging may need to be reevaluated, and the precise role for helical CTA more clearly defined.",

    "abstract": "To determine the relevance of popliteal dilatations, knowledge of the normal popliteal artery diameter is essential. This study investigates the diameter of the popliteal artery in healthy males and females.\nWe measured the diameter of the popliteal artery in 121 healthy volunteers (59 males and 62 females), ages 8 to 81, with echo-tracking B-mode ultrasonography. We analyzed the influence of age, sex, height, weight, body surface area (BSA) and systolic blood pressure with a multiple regression model.\nThe popliteal artery increased steadily in diameter throughout life. From 25 years on, the diameter was larger in males than in females. If corrected for BSA, this difference decreased from 17% to 7%. This study found a correlation between popliteal artery diameter and BSA (r=0.47 and r=0.61, respectively, p < 0.0001). Age, followed by BSA, was the most influencing factor on popliteal diameter in both males and females (r=0.62 and r=0.66, respectively, p < 0.0001). We used age and BSA in creating a model for prediction of popliteal artery diameter.\nThe diameter of the popliteal artery increases with age, initially during growth, but also in adults. This is related to age, body size and sex, with males having larger arteries than females. It is now possible to predict the normal popliteal arterial diameter, and nomograms are presented for use in the study of aneurysmal arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "An established method of cryostorage that might preserve the vascular and endothelial responses of human femoral arteries (HFAs) to be transplanted as allografts was studied.\nHFAs were harvested from multiorgan donors and stored at 4 degrees C in Belzer solution before cryostorage. One hundred eleven HFA rings were isolated and randomly assigned to 1 control group of unfrozen HFAs and 2 groups of HFAs cryopreserved for 7 and 30 days, respectively. Cryopreservation was performed in Elohes solution containing dimethyl sulfoxide (1.8 mmol/L), and the rate of cooling was 1.6 degrees C/min, until -141 degrees C was reached. The contractile and relaxant responses of unfrozen and frozen/thawed arteries were assessed in organ bath by measurement of isometric force generated by the HFAs.\nAfter thawing, the maximal contractile responses to all the contracting agonists tested (KCl, U46619 [a thromboxane A2-mimetic], norepinephrine, serotonin, and endothelin-1) were in the range of 7% to 34% of the responses in unfrozen HFAs. The endothelium-independent relaxant responses to forskolin and verapamil were weakly altered, whereas the endothelium-independent relaxant responses to sodium nitroprusside were markedly reduced. Cryostorage of HFAs also resulted in a loss of the endothelium-dependent relaxant response to acetylcholine. The vascular and endothelial responses were similarly altered in the HFAs cryopreserved for 7 and 30 days.\nThe cryopreservation method used provided a limited preservation of HFAs contractility, a good preservation of the endothelium-independent relaxant responses, but no apparent preservation of the endothelium-dependent relaxation. It is possible that further refinements of the cryopreservation protocol, such as a slower rate of cooling and a more controlled stepwise addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, might allow better post-thaw functional recovery of HFAs.",

Two periods were studied. Period 1 was a retrospective analysis of documented cases of VTE in the trauma registry from 1993 to 1995 (n=39). The period was also a review of all patients admitted to a trauma ICU in 1994 without VTE who met the following criteria: age greater than 11 years, ICU stay of more than 36 hours, and survival of more than 72 hours (n=227). Period 2 was a concurrent analysis of 1996 documented cases of VTE and similarly selected ICU admissions (VTE, n=10; no VTE, n=224). Risk factor scores (R1, admitting; R2, total) were calculated from the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery/Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards. The scores were cumulative by category and over time. The suitability of such standards was determined in period 1. The resulting therapeutic and surveillance guidelines were evaluated in period 2.\nPeriod 1 risk factor scores, R1 and R2, were correlated with the occurrence of VTE from chi2 test (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Risk categories were grouped as low, moderate, and high. VTE was not observed in the low-risk group (0 to 2). Among all VTE (n=49), 11 cases occurred in patients with moderate-risk scores and 38 in patients with high-risk scores. In 1994 and 1996, the selected groups were analyzed and the incidence rate of VTE was 4.7% in both years for the moderate-risk group and 2.5% and 4.8% for the high-risk group, respectively. Most VTE cases (78%) received some form of prophylaxis (PRx), and 26% of cases had multiple methods of prophylaxis (MPRx). This included 80% of the cases that received unfractionated heparin. In period 2, no pulmonary emboli (PE) occurred, in contrast to period 1, in which 16 of 39 cases of VTE (41%) were first seen with PE. In period 2, no patient receiving MPRx, including compression and LMWH, had VTE develop. Surveillance VDUS discovered 60% of 1996 cases in period 2. No PE were seen in period 2.\nStandard risk factors were easily applied to the trauma patient at the bedside. Patients at low risk needed no PRx. Patients at high risk did best with both compression devices and LMWH. VDUS was recommended selectively in patients at high risk in whom multiple-method PRx could not be achieved. Patients at moderate risk required further study to define optimal PRx and need for surveillance VDUS. Intracaval devices were used prophylactically only twice.",

    "abstract": "To differentiate between the phenomenon of collateral perfusion from a side branch versus graft-related endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), with respect to aneurysm size and prognosis.\nWe successfully treated 64 AAA patients with endovascular grafting. We followed all the patients postoperatively with spiral computed tomography at one, three, six and 12 months, and biannually thereafter. We measured aneurysm diameters preoperatively and postoperatively. We calculated preoperatively the relation of maximum aortic diameter (D) to the thrombus-free lumen diameter (L) expressed as an L/D ratio. Median follow-up was 15 months.\nSixteen patients had collateral perfusion during follow-up. We successfully treated two patients with embolization. One patient showed resolution of collateral perfusion after we stopped warfarin treatment. Two patients died of unrelated causes during follow-up. One patient was converted to surgical treatment, and two patients showed spontaneous resolution of their collateral perfusion. The group of patients with perfusion showed no statistically significant change of their aortic diameter on follow-up. The group of patients without perfusion showed a median decrease in aortic diameter of 8mm (p < 0.0001) at 18 months postoperatively. The group of patients with perfusion had significantly less thrombus in their aneurysm sac preoperatively than the group without perfusion, as expressed by the L/D ratio (mean L/D 0,61 versus 0,78, respectively; p=0.0021.)\nThere was no significant increase in aortic diameter on an average 18 months postoperatively despite persistent collateral perfusion. This may indicate a halted disease progression in the short term. Embolization of collateral vessels is associated with risk of paraplegia. We recommend a conservative approach with close observation if aneurysm diameter is stable.",

    "abstract": "Endoleakage is a fairly common problem after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm and may prevent successful exclusion of the aneurysm. The consequences of endoleakage in terms of pressure in the aneurysmal sac are not exactly known. Moreover, the diagnosis of endoleakage is a problem because visualization of endoleaks can be difficult.\nWith an ex vivo model of circulation with an artificial aneurysm managed by means of a tube graft, studies were performed to evaluate precisely known diameters of endoleaks with both imaging techniques (computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography) and pressure measurements of the aneurysmal sac. The experiments were performed without endoleak (controls) and with 1.231-French (0.410 mm), 3-French (1 mm), and 7-French (2.33 mm) endoleaks. Pressure and imaging were evaluated in the absence and presence of a simulated open lumbar artery. The pressure in the prosthesis and in the aneurysmal sac were recorded simultaneously. Digital subtraction angiography with and without a Lucite acrylic plate, computed tomographic angiography, and delayed computed tomographic angiography were performed. For the first experiments, the aneurysmal sac was filled with starch solution. All tests were repeated with fresh thrombus in the aneurysmal sac.\nEach endoleak was associated with a diastolic pressure in the aneurysmal sac that was identical to diastolic systemic pressure, although the pressure curve was damped. At digital subtraction angiography without a Lucite acrylic plate, the 1.231-French (0.410 mm) endoleak was visualized without an open lumbar artery. When a Lucite acrylic plate was added, the endoleak was not visible until a lumbar artery was opened. In the presence of thrombus within the aneurysmal sac, all endoleaks were not visualized at digital subtraction angiography. At computed tomographic angiography, all endoleaks were not visualized in the absence of a thrombus mass in the aneurysmal sac. In the presence of thrombus within the aneurysmal sac, the 1.231-French (0.410 mm) endoleak became visible after opening of a simulated lumbar artery. At delayed computed tomographic angiography, all endoleaks were visualized without and with thrombus.\nEvery endoleak, even a very small one, caused pressure greater than systemic diastolic pressure within the aneurysmal sac. However, small endoleaks were not visualized with digital subtraction angiography and computed tomographic angiography, whereas all endoleaks were visualized with a delayed computed tomographic angiography protocol. We believe that follow-up examinations after stent graft placement for aortic aneurysms should focus on pressure measurements, but until this is clinically feasible, delayed computed tomographic angiography should be performed.",

All previous diagnoses recorded in a hospital computer database were received for 4404 men 65 to 73 years of age who had been invited to a population screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. One hundred forty-one men had AAA (4.2%). They were asked to participate in an interview, a clinical examination, and collection of blood sample. Men with an abdominal aortic aneurysm 3 to 5 cm in diameter were offered annual ultrasound scans to check for expansion.\nAmong patients with COPD 7.7% had abdominal aortic aneurysms (crude odds ratio=2.05). The adjusted odds ratio, however, was only 1.59 after adjustment for coexisting diseases associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (P=.13). The mean annual expansion was 2.74 mm per year among patients with COPD, 2.72 among patients without COPD, and 4.7 mm among patients who used oral steroids compared with 2.6 among patients who did not use steroids (P < .05). Concentration of serum elastin peptide and plasma elastase-alpha1-antitrypsin complexes correlated negatively with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) among patients with COPD. However, multivariate regression analysis showed that concentration of serum elastin peptide, therapy with beta-agonists, and FEV1 correlated positively with degree of expansion but that concentration of plasma elastase-alpha1-antitrypsin complexes and serum alpha1-antitrypsin did not influence expansion, suggesting that elastase plays an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD but not of abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nThe high prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm among patients with COPD is more likely to be caused by medication and coexisting diseases rather than a common pathway of pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate our results with lower extremity arterial reconstruction (LEAR) in patients 80 years of age or older and to assess its impact on ambulatory function and residential status.\nWe performed a retrospective review of all patients 80 years of age or older undergoing LEAR at a single institution from January 1990 through December 1995. Preoperative information regarding residential status and ambulatory function was obtained from the hospital record and vascular registry. Telephone interviews with patients or next of kin were undertaken to provide information regarding postoperative residential status and ambulatory function. Residential status and level of ambulatory function were graded by a simple scoring system in which 1 indicates living independently, walking without assistance; 2 indicate living at home with family, walking with an ambulatory assistance device; 3 indicates an extended stay in a rehabilitation facility, using a wheelchair; and 4 indicates permanent nursing home, bedridden. Preoperative and postoperative scores for both residential status and ambulatory function were compared. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for graft patency, limb salvage, and patient survival.\nTwo hundred ninety-nine lower extremity bypass operations were performed in 262 patients 80 years of age or older (45% men, mean age 83.6 years, range 80 to 96 years). Sixty-seven percent of the patients had diabetes mellitus. Limb salvage was the indication for operation in 96%. The preoperative mean residential status and ambulatory function scores were 1.79+/-0.65 and 1.55+/-0.66, respectively. The perioperative mortality rate at 30 days was 2.3%. The median length of hospital stay decreased from 16 days in 1990 to 8 days in 1995 (range 4 to 145 days). Eighty-seven percent of grafts were performed with the autologous vein. The 5-year primary, assisted primary, and secondary graft patency rates for all grafts were 72%, 80%, and 87%, respectively. The limb salvage rate at 5 years was 92%. The patient survival rate at 5 years was 44%. The postoperative residential status and ambulatory function scores were 1.95+/-0.80 and 1.70+/-0.66, respectively. Overall scores remained the same or improved in 88% and 78% of patients, respectively.\nLEAR in octogenarians is safe, with graft patency and limb salvage rates comparable to those reported for younger patients.

The additional affliction of renal and other splanchnic arteries often affords complex corrective procedures. We report on our single-center long-term experiences with operative treatment of this malformation.\nOver a period of 21 years, 15 patients (10 female and 5 male patients; age range, 8 to 57 years) were operated on for DAAC. Six patients had additional stenoses of eight renal arteries, and three had splanchnic arterial obstructions. At 4 to 25 years after the operation, all surviving patients underwent a clinical and a spiral computed tomography examination.\nThere was one intraoperative death due to exsanguination after the rupture of a poststenotic aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta. Fourteen patients were discharged free of symptoms. During follow-up, four repeated operations were necessary for renal arterial bypass stenoses or aneurysms. One late death occurred as the result of an unrelated disease.\nComplete operative correction of DAAC usually can be accomplished as a single-stage procedure with low morbidity and mortality rates. The reconstruction of all renal arteries is essential to cure hypertension. Consequent follow-up is recommended for detection of late postoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "Six cases of adventitial cystic disease were studied, and the existing theories of the aetiology of adventitial cystic disease were reviewed to present evidence in support of a variation of the developmental hypothesis that might explain the sites of occurrence of this rare condition.\nCases of adventitial cystic disease were collected by interrogation of the records of a group of vascular surgeons in the Johannesburg area. After reviewing the relevant literature, the sites of occurrence of 323 cases of adventitial cystic disease were documented, and the theories of the formation of adventitial cystic disease were reviewed. The embryological origin of those vessels in which adventitial cystic disease occurs was investigated. Clinical cases were collected in private practice vascular referral centers. The clinical features, treatment, and subsequent course of six cases of adventitial cystic disease (four related to the popliteal artery, one in the femoral artery, and one in the radial artery) are included.\nAll cases of adventitial cystic disease reported have occurred in the nonaxial arteries, which form at a later stage than the axial vessels during limb differentiation and development. It is therefore postulated that during limb bud development cell rests derived from condensations of mesenchymal tissue destined to form the knee, hip, wrist, or ankle joints are incorporated into the nearby and adjacent nonaxial vessels during development of these vessels in the 15-22-week stage. These newly forming nonaxial vessels develop from vascular plexuses during the same stage of development, and in close proximity to the adjacent condensing joint structures. It is further postulated that these cell rests are then responsible for the formation of adventitial cystic disease later in life, when the mucoid material secreted results in a mass lesion within the arterial or venous wall.\nThere is evidence supporting the hypothesis that adventitial cystic disease is a developmental condition occurring in the nonaxial blood vessels.",

The first patient, a 62-year-old man, had a two-week history of left lower quadrant pain, tenderness, and nonpulsatile mass after a paracentesis for ascites. A left inferior epigastric artery pseudoaneurysm measuring 10 cm in diameter and 20 cm in length was diagnosed by means of Duplex ultrasound and arteriography. The patient was treated with percutaneous embolization, with successful thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm. The second patient, a 33-year-old woman, had a six-week history of left lower quadrant pain, tenderness, and nonpulsatile mass after a paracentesis for ascites. Computerized tomography and arteriography showed a left inferior epigastric artery pseudoaneurysm, measuring 7 cm in diameter and 9 cm in length. The patient was treated with percutaneous embolization with successful thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm. Both patients were discharged in good condition 2 days after embolization. Inferior epigastric artery pseudoaneurysm is a complication of paracentesis, and percutaneous embolization may be preferable to surgical repair in patients with chronic liver failure and portal hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Collections of serous fluid surrounding prosthetic grafts can be caused by infection or transudation of serum, and making the distinction is often troublesome. Bergamini and his colleagues developed a dog model of low-grade prosthetic graft contamination with Staphylococcus epidermatis. All animals developed evidence of graft infection, and 13 of 18 dogs developed a fluid-filled perigraft cyst. Signs of systemic infection, however, were present in only 1 animal, and the Staphylococcus epidermatis study strain was isolated from the tissue surrounding the graft in only 1 dog. The authors had to disrupt the biofilm to achieve positive cultures in 14 of 18 animals. This animal model seemed to conform to clinical experience and placed great emphasis on the role of indolent infections in the pathogenesis of perigraft fluid collection. It is equally clear that perigraft fluid collections may result from transudation of fluid through the prosthetic surfaces, which act similar to a dialysis membrane under certain circumstances. Noninfectious seromas are characterized generally by the accumulation of clear serous fluid with a protein and glucose content of serum and the lack of acute inflammatory cells when the sediment is examined. The need to distinguish between these 2 forms of fluid accumulation became important in the treatment of a 62-year-old man who was seen 2 1/2 years after the repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with an aortobiiliac stretch polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prosthesis. There was no evidence of infection, and there was a 12 cm cystic mass surrounding a patent PTFE prosthesis.",

Fourteen days after the procedure, the patient had a fever, hypotension, and an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. Blood cultures were positive for S. aureus on admission and during the patient's hospitalization, despite intravenous vancomycin therapy. Evaluation included serial CT scans, revealing increasing persistent inflammation with development of multiple renal intraparenchymal abscesses, and arteriography, showing marked degeneration of the renal artery. Therapy required resection of the renal artery/stent and nephrectomy. This case confirms the severe nature of S. aureus stent infection; we recommend prophylactic antibiotics before these procedures, as well as expeditious evaluation and consideration for aggressive surgical therapy if this complication is suspected.",

    "abstract": "The usefulness of vascular stenting was demonstrated in both arterial and venous applications to restore patency and improve suboptimal results after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Dislodgment of venous stents with an embolization into the right cavities or the pulmonary artery, however, is one of the most feared complications of this procedure. Percutaneous removal of these migrated stents is an appealing method of replacing more invasive operative intervention with cardiopulmonary bypass, which may be very hazardous in these often severely ill patients. We describe the cases of two patients with stents that migrated into the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. In one patient, we were able to successfully remove these stents by using an angioplasty balloon with an operative extraction from the iliac vein, thereby obviating the need for a major operative procedure.",

    "abstract": "Skin damage in the presence of chronic venous disease is partially mediated through leukocytes. The endothelium is activated and exhibits proliferation in the skin. Up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the skin of patients with chronic venous disease has been demonstrated with immunohistologic techniques. Abnormal VEGF expression can have local deleterious effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with chronic venous disease have elevated plasma levels of VEGF. We conducted a prospective study with 30 patients with varicose veins of clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathologic class C3 (normal skin, n = 15) and C4 (trophic skin changes, n = 15) and 25 control subjects with no clinical evidence of venous or arterial disease of the lower limb. Blood samples were collected from a foot vein of each subject before and after a period of experimental venous hypertension produced by means of standing. Assay of VEGF protein was performed with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma VEGF level was elevated in both groups of patients with venous disease compared with the control group. The median VEGF levels among patients were 81 pg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 56 to 122) supine and 98 pg/mL (IQR 63 to 153) after standing for 30 minutes. Median VEGF levels among control subjects were 52 pg/mL (IQR 35 to 71) lying supine and 60 pg/mL (IQR 39 to 105) after standing for 30 minutes. Experimental venous hypertension caused a small rise in VEGF levels among the patients but not the control subjects. Further studies are required to determine whether increased VEGF expression contributes to tissue injury in chronic venous disease.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of vascular prosthesis failure are reported to be associated, in part, with an atherosclerotic degenerative process that is related to an abnormal lipid infiltration. The lipid uptake in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts was reproduced in vitro, and the effect of time on the permeability of these prostheses was studied.\nWater permeability tests were carried out under dynamic flow conditions at various hydrostatic pressures. Lipid uptake was simulated by circulating a phosphatidylcholine suspension inside an expanded Teflon prosthesis under pulsatile or continuous transmural pressure ranging between 80 mm Hg and 180 mm Hg, at a flow rate of 500 mL/min and 2000 mL/min, for a duration ranging from 2 hours to 1 month.\nWater permeability tests indicated that under hydrostatic pressures of 180 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg, water percolated through the prosthesis wall after an exposure of 720 minutes and 75 minutes, respectively. After exposing the prostheses to the lipid dispersion under the various flow conditions, the fluid convection through the wall occurred. Preferential convection pathways with a constant periodicity were observed across the length of each prosthesis and were, therefore, associated with regularly spaced perforations depicted in the structure of the devices. Phospholipids gradually agglomerated within the prosthesis wall, allowing a restrictive molecular mobility.

Preferential convection pathways with a constant periodicity were observed across the length of each prosthesis and were, therefore, associated with regularly spaced perforations depicted in the structure of the devices. Phospholipids gradually agglomerated within the prosthesis wall, allowing a restrictive molecular mobility.

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and matrix metalloproteases have been noted to be elevated in human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) as compared with normal and occlusive aortic disease. Because TNF and IL-1 have been shown to cause release of proteases that weaken the aortic matrix, it has been suggested that these cytokines may play a central role in the aortic dilatation process. To substantiate this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of TNF and IL-1 antagonists, tumor necrosis factor binding protein (TNF-BP) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), on the development of AAAs in a well-described rat model.\nIsolated segments of infrarenal aorta of 16 rats were perfused with porcine elastase. In the treated group, eight rats were given intravenous TNF-BP prior to elastase perfusion, at 48 hours and at 96 hours. In the control group, eight rats were given only intravenous vehicle at the same time intervals. Isolated segments of infrarenal aorta of an additional 16 rats were perfused with porcine elastase in a similar fashion. In the treated group, eight rats were given intraperitoneal IL-1RA prior to celiotomy and every eight hours. In the control group, eight rats were given only intraperitoneal vehicle at the same time intervals. On the sixth postoperative day, all rats underwent celiotomy and measurement of the infrarenal aortic diameter with a micrometer while the animal was alive. Aortic specimens were collected on day six for hematoxylin and eosin staining, trichrome staining, and gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) zymography.\nTNF-BP was completely able to block post elastase dilation, whereas IL-1Ra seemed to have no effect. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and trichrome staining revealed that animals treated with TNF-BP had less of an inflammatory response and preservation of the elastin and smooth muscles in the media of the aortic wall as compared with animals treated with IL-1RA or vehicle. Zymography was not able to detect significant protease activity in the aortic wall of any of the rats at six days.\nTNF-BP, but not IL-1RA, may inhibit the development of AAAs in this model.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of isovolemic hemodilution with dextran-70 on thrombus formation and blood flow in synthetic venous vessel grafts. Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (length, 11 mm; inner diameter, 3 mm) were inserted into the vena cava of rabbits. Six groups were studied: (1) the control group; (2) animals that underwent isovolemic hemodilution with dextran-70 to a hematocrit of about 30%; (3) animals that underwent isovolemic dextran hemodilution combined with a bolus injection of heparin; (4) animals that underwent heparin treatment only; (5) animals that underwent isovolemic dextran hemodilution combined with infusion of desmopressin; and (6) animals that underwent an identical treatment to group 3 but with a 2-week, instead of a 2-day, follow-up. Vena cava blood flow was measured before and after hemodilution and graft insertion and at the termination of the experiments at 2 days (groups 1 to 5) and 2 weeks (group 6) after surgery. Graft patency and thrombus mass weight were evaluated. In the control group, most of the vessels occluded within 2 days. Hemodilution with dextran improved blood flow and reduced thrombus mass weight significantly. Desmopressin, which increases factor VIII, did not influence the effects of hemodilution with dextran, which suggests that the effects of dextran are not mediated by a reduction in the level of this coagulation factor. A single bolus dose of heparin did not reduce thrombus formation in the grafts but did potentiate the effects of isovolemic hemodilution on thrombus mass and graft blood flow. We conclude that isovolemic dextran hemodilution combined with a single bolus of heparin had beneficial long-lasting effects. The grafts in groups 3 and 6 were all patent.",

Patients with malignant disease were excluded from this series. All patients had transfemoral venous thrombectomy with construction of an inguinal arteriovenous fistula and perioperative anticoagulation with heparin with a switch to warfarin sodium for at least 12 postoperative months. Immediate results of thrombectomy were documented by means of intraoperative completion venography. Arteriovenous fistulas were ligated 3 months after control arteriovenography. Since 1995 venous spurs eventually detected during thrombectomy were treated immediately by means of stent implantation.\nAmong 61 patients with left-sided thrombosis, intraoperative phlebography revealed common iliac venous obstruction suggestive of venous spurs in 30 patients (49%). In 16 of 22 patients (73%) with untreated spurs, postoperative rethrombosis of the iliac vein was documented despite adequate anticoagulation. Only one of eight patients (13%) with stented spurs had reocclusion (chi2 test P < .01).\nVenous spurs are found among about half of patients with left-sided iliac venous thrombosis. As long as the underlying venous pathologic process is left untreated, thrombectomy will not restore patency. Stent implantation is a simple and safe means to correct central venous strictures and provides excellent long-term results.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the accuracy of color-flow duplex ultrasound (DUS) in planning lower extremity revascularization procedures, we prospectively compared operations predicted by means of DUS arterial scanning (DUSAS) and operations predicted by means of conventional angiography (CA) with actual operations performed in 36 patients undergoing 40 vascular reconstructions for critical (grade II/III) lower extremity ischemia.\nAll patients were examined with lower extremity DUSAS followed by CA. DUSAS was performed from the aorta to the pedal vessels of the affected extremity. Adequacy of inflow was assessed, and the best distal target vessel with continuous, unobstructed flow was defined. An operative prediction was made and recorded based upon the DUSAS findings, and in a blinded fashion, based upon subsequent CA. The McNemar test for comparing correlated proportions was applied to test for the statistical significance of the difference (P < .05) between correct operations predicted by DUSAS and CA.\nOf the actual operations performed, 83% were correctly predicted by means of DUSAS (95% CI; range, 77% to 89%). Seven operations were incorrectly predicted with DUSAS. Of the actual operations performed, 90% were correctly predicted by means of CA (95% CI; range, 81% to 99%). Four operations were incorrectly predicted with CA.

    "abstract": "No currently available noninvasive test can preoperatively predict a successful outcome to renal revascularization. Resistance measurements from the renal parenchyma obtained with duplex sonography reflect the magnitude of intraparenchymal disease, and patients with extensive intrarenal disease may respond less favorably to revascularization. To address this question, we reviewed our (primarily) operative experience in patients undergoing renal artery revascularization, and compared the blood pressure (BP) and renal function response with resistance measurements obtained from the kidney both before and after revascularization.\nDuring a 56-month period, 31 consecutive renal artery revascularizations (25 surgical and 6 percutaneous angioplasties) were performed in 23 patients (21 atherosclerotic, 2 fibromuscular dysplasia). Duplex sonography was performed in each patient before and after revascularization, and parenchymal diastolic/systolic (d/s) ratios were calculated. BP and renal function response to intervention were compared with measurements of intrarenal flow patterns before and after revascularization.\nMean parenchymal peak systolic velocity was significantly higher after repair in all patients (pre-repair: 19.5 +/- 1.3, postrepair: 27.2 +/- 1.7; P < .0001). Despite this, there were no statistical differences between preoperative and postoperative parenchymal d/s ratios. A favorable (cured or improved) BP response was seen in 81% (17 of 21) of revascularizations performed for hypertension. Among these successes, parenchymal d/s ratios were in the normal range (ie, > or = 0.30) both before and after repair (mean prerepair: 0.34 +/- 0.03, mean postrepair: 0.31 +/- 0.03; not significant). In 4 patients in which BP failed to improve after intervention, the d/s ratio was abnormal before surgery (< 0.3), and remained so after revascularization (mean preoperative d/s ratio: 0.18 +/- 0.04, mean postoperative d/s ratio: 0.11 +/- 0.04; P = .003). Mean preoperative parenchymal d/s ratios were significantly higher in all patients with a successful BP response when compared with failures (P = .048). Similarly, among patients with single artery repairs, mean preoperative d/s ratios approached significance in successes vs. failures (success: 0.40 +/- 0.03, failure: 0.21 +/- 0.03; P = .054). A decrease in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 20% was seen in 8 of 18 patients (44%) with ischemic nephropathy. These patients also had normal d/s ratios preoperatively (mean 0.39 +/- 0.04), whereas the 10 patients who failed to improve had significantly lower ratios (mean 0.24 +/- 0.03; P = .041). Kidney length did not correlate with d/s ratio.\nAlthough we do not believe that duplex sonographic measurement of intrarenal flow patterns alone is an accurate means of assessing main renal artery occlusive disease, the resistive indices seem to reflect the magnitude of intraparenchymal disease, and thus may provide important prognostic information for patients undergoing surgical revascularization. Our data suggest that a preoperative d/s ratio below 0.3 correlates with clinical failure relative to BP and renal function responses.",

Long-term studies to study the durability and complication rate of the different wall configurations of ePTFE grafts have not been carried out. The primary, secondary, and cumulative patency and other complications between standard thickness (STD) and thin wall (THN) 6 mm stretch ePTFE grafts (WL Gore & Assoc, Flagstaff, AZ) was prospectively evaluated.\nFrom September 1993 to August 1995, 108 patients receiving new grafts were randomized into 2 groups: those receiving STD grafts (n = 56) or those receiving THN (n = 52) grafts. Data prospectively collected included day of first access, primary patency, interventions required, and long-term results. Infections, pseudoaneurysms, and mortality were also documented. Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare the 2 groups, and log-rank life tables were constructed and compared.\nMean follow-up examination time was 38.1 +/- 0.8 months for STD grafts and 35.1 +/- 1.0 months for THN grafts (P<.03). Longer patency was noted in the STD group of grafts (18.2 months for STD vs. 12.1 months for THN).

We sought to evaluate the effects of anticoagulation therapy after autogenous vein infrainguinal revascularization on duration of patency, limb salvage rates, and complication rates in this subset of patients.\nThis randomized prospective trial was performed in a university tertiary care hospital and in a Veterans Affairs Hospital. Fifty-six patients who were at high risk for graft failure were randomized to receive aspirin (24 patients, 27 bypass grafts) or aspirin and warfarin (WAR; 32 patients, 37 bypass grafts). All patients received 325 mg of aspirin each day, and the patients who were randomized to warfarin underwent anticoagulation therapy with heparin immediately after surgery and then were started on warfarin therapy to maintain an international normalized ratio between 2 and 3. Perioperative blood transfusions and complications were compared with the Student t test or with the chi2 test. Graft patency rates, limb salvage rates, and survival rates were compared with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.\nSixty-one of the 64 bypass grafts were performed for rest pain or tissue loss, and 3 were performed for short-distance claudication. There were no differences between the groups in ages, indications, bypass graft types, risk classifications (ie, conduit, runoff, or graft failure), or comorbid conditions (except diabetes mellitus). The cumulative 5-year survival rate was similar between the groups. The incidence rate of postoperative hematoma (32% vs 3.7%; P = .004) was greater in the WAR group, but no differences were seen between the WAR group and the aspirin group in the number of packed red blood cells transfused, in the incidence rate of overall nonhemorrhagic wound complications, or in the overall complication rate (62% vs 52%). The immediate postoperative primary graft patency rates (97.3% vs 85.2%) and limb salvage rates (100% vs 88.9%) were higher in the WAR group as compared with the aspirin group. Furthermore, the cumulative 3-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were significantly greater in the WAR group versus the aspirin group (74% vs 51%, P = .04; 77% vs 56%, P = .05; 81% vs 56%, P = .02) and cumulative limb salvage rates were higher in the WAR group (81% vs 31%, P = .01).\nPerioperative anticoagulation therapy with heparin increases the incidence rate of wound hematomas, but long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin improves the patency rate of autogenous vein infrainguinal bypass grafts and the limb salvage rate for patients at high risk for graft failure.",

    "abstract": "This study prospectively assessed the incidence of heparin-induced antibodies in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery and determined whether the incidence is influenced by previous heparin exposure.\nFifty-four hospitalized patients (36 men and 18 women) undergoing peripheral vascular surgery and receiving intraoperative heparin anticoagulation were studied. Unfractionated porcine heparin was given for intraoperative anticoagulation and was not continued postoperatively. Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 36 patients, aortic reconstruction in 11 patients, and infrainguinal bypass in 7 patients. Plasma was tested before and after (14 +/- 7.5 [SD] days) surgery for IgG antibodies to the complex of heparin/platelet factor 4, using a standardized, validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results are expressed as an optical density ratio (ODR) of patient plasma to normal plasma, with the threshold for a positive result of > or = 1.8. Platelet counts and clinical outcomes were also assessed.\nThe mean patient age was 67.2 +/- 9.7 years. A prior exposure to heparin was documented in 41% of patients. The mean intraoperative heparin dose was 9089 +/- 3607 units. Only 1 patient converted from a negative antibody status to a positive status (1.9%, 95% CI = 0.10%-11.18%).

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the clinical outcomes for patients with Greenfield filters placed in the suprarenal (SR) inferior vena cava (IVC).\nWe collected data prospectively from annual follow-up evaluations of patients with filters. Patients underwent venous color-flow duplex examinations of the IVC and lower extremities, abdominal radiographs, and physical assessment. The outcomes for those patients with filters in the SR IVC were compared with the outcomes previously reported and with the outcomes for patients with filters in the infrarenal cava.\nSR placement accounted for 7.6% (148/1932) of all filter placements. Follow-up data were available for 73 placements, or 49%. No cases of renal dysfunction were related to filter placement. The rate of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) was 8%, and the rate of long-term caval occlusion was 2.7%. These rates did not differ statistically from the rates for patients with infrarenal filters (P > .05). Male patients tended to be older by 15 years, to have more recurrent PE, and to experience more filter migration (6 vs 2 mm). Failure of SR filters to prevent PE was associated statistically with the primary indication for placement. Recurrent PE was the indication in 5 of 6 patients who sustained PE after SR filter placement (P = .007). Filter limb fracture was seen only with the stainless-steel Greenfield filter.\nGreenfield filters placed above the renal vein provide protection from PE with a minimal risk of occlusion.

    "abstract": "Longitudinal studies have revealed that the aortic segment proximal to an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is at risk for continued enlargement after a standard aneurysm repair. Similarly, preliminary reports have shown expansion of one or both aortic necks after endovascular repair. Although some investigators have suggested that this may be a transient effect, continued dilatation at the endograft attachment site could effect the overall device stability.\nAs part of a multi-institutional trial of endovascular grafting for the treatment of AAA, 59 patients were successfully implanted with straight endografts between February 1993 and January 1995. A morphometric analysis of aortic neck size was undertaken with serial review of computed tomography scans available through April 1997. The neck sizes at both graft attachment sites were measured, with investigators blinded to patient identity and date of scan. Changes in minor diameter were defined, annual interval expansion rates were calculated, and the data were correlated with endoleak, device migration, aneurysm size change, endograft diameter, attachment system fractures, and initial preimplant neck size.\nSignificant aortic neck enlargement, particularly at the level of the distal neck, was observed for at least 24 months after AAA repair. The annual interval dilation rates of the proximal aortic neck were 0.7 +/- 2.1 mm/year (P = .023) and 0.9 +/- 1.9 (P = .008) mm/year during the first and second years, respectively. Enlargement of the distal neck during the observation period was more marked, with corresponding annual expansion rates of 1.7 +/- 2.9 mm/year (P < .001) and 1.9 +/- 2.5 (P < .001) mm/year. In 5 patients (14%), the minor diameter of the distal neck was at least 6 mm larger than the preimplant diameter of the graft. Migration of the distal attachment system was observed in 3 of these 5 patients. Expansion rates did not have a statistically significant correlation with initial neck size, endograft dimensions, aneurysm size change, presence of endoleak, or attachment system fracture.\nAortic neck enlargement was observed for at least 2 years after endovascular grafting. Close patient follow-up remains mandatory in lieu of the potential risk of late failure as a result of continued aortic expansion. The relative contribution of device design to this phenomenon will need to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture has been historically associated with high operative mortality rates. In this community-based, cross-sectional study, we examined factors influencing outcome after operations performed for ruptured AAA (rAAA).\nAn analysis of a state database identified 3820 patients who underwent AAA repair between 1990 and 1995, including 527 (13.8%) who had an operation for an rAAA. Demographic variables examined included patient age, gender, race, associated comorbidity rates, operative surgeon experience with rAAA, and annual hospital rAAA and total AAA operative volumes. Outcomes measured included operative mortality rates, hospital length of stay, and charges.\nOperative mortality rates increased significantly with advancing age (P < 0.0001) but were not related to gender (P = 0.474) or race (p = 0.598) and were significantly lower among patients with hypertension (P = 0.006) or pulmonary disease (P = 0.045). There was no relationship between hospital rAAA or total AAA volume and rAAA repair mortality rate, although high-volume surgeons (i.e., performing more than 10 rAAA repairs) had decreased mortality rates and hospital charges compared with other surgeons. Hospital lengths of stay and charges increased with age among survivors, but not nonsurvivors, of rAAA repair. Despite a stable incidence of rAAA repairs during the study interval and no significant change in the mean age of patients undergoing operation or the percentage of operations performed by high-volume surgeons, the statewide mortality rate declined from 59.3% to 43.2% (P = 0.039).\nThe incidence of rAAA does not appear to be declining. Although operative rAAA repair continues to be associated with substantial risk and remains an especially lethal condition among the elderly, the operative mortality rate has declined in recent years in Maryland. Lower operative mortality rates and hospital charges are associated with operations performed by high-volume surgeons.",

This study was performed to determine the risk factors, associated events, and outcomes for patients with GIC.\nWe performed a secondary analysis of a prospective study that examined 120 consecutive patients who underwent transperitoneal aortic revascularization for aneurysmal or occlusive disease.\nThe following 29 GICs developed in 25 patients (21%) within 30 days of aortic surgery: paralytic ileus that required replacement of nasogastric tubes (n = 12), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5), Clostridium difficile enterocolitis (n = 5), acute cholecystitis (n = 2), mechanical obstruction (n = 2), ascites (n = 2), and colon ischemia (n = 1). Seven patients required operations for GICs after aortic revascularization. A comparison of patients with and without GICs showed no differences in the prevalence of risk factors, presence of mesenteric artery stenoses, coexisting medical illnesses, antecedent gastrointestinal history, operative indication, preoperative fluid administration, or duration of operation. However, patients with GICs had more intraoperative complications (P = .004), greater intraoperative blood loss (P = .02), and more fluids during the postoperative period (P = .008). The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 71 +/- 23 hours for patients with GICs versus 7 +/- 2 hours for patients without GICs (P = .006). A higher prevalence of pulmonary (P = .004) and renal (P = .001) complications was seen in the patients with GICs. The mean stay in the intensive care unit was 16 +/- 2 days for patients with GICs as compared with 5 +/- 0.4 days for patients without GICs (P < .001). Four deaths occurred, all caused by multisystem organ failure: 3 patients had GICs, and 1 did not have a GIC (P = .007).\nThese results show that GICs are prevalent in transperitoneal aortic surgery and are associated with severe morbidity rates, increased hospital costs because of prolonged stay, and increased mortality rates. Some GICs appear to be associated with intraoperative events that lead to visceral hypoperfusion, and others can be attributed to mechanical causes. However, none of the variables examined in this study were predictive of GICs. In all, GICs should be considered serious adverse sequela after aortic revascularization. Because no risk factors for GICs have been identified, these complications currently cannot be prevented.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting (PTAS) has been considered a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for stroke prevention. Interventionalists have suggested that PTAS carries less anesthetic risk than CEA. The treatment of carotid stenosis with local or regional anesthesia (LRA) allows direct intraprocedural neurologic evaluation and avoids the potential risks of general anesthesia.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical charts of 377 patients who underwent 414 procedures for the elective treatment of carotid stenosis in 433 cerebral hemispheres with LRA between August 1994 and May 1997. Group I (312 hemispheres) underwent PTAS, and group II (121 hemispheres) underwent CEA.\nThe indications for treatment included the following: asymptomatic severe stenosis (n = 272; 62.8%), transient ischemic attack (TIA; n = 100; 23.1%), and prior stroke (n = 61; 14.1%). The early neurologic results for the patients in group I (n = 268) included 11 TIAs (4.1%), 23 strokes (8.6%), and 3 deaths (1.1%). The early neurologic results for the patients in group II (n = 109) included 2 TIAs (1.8%), one stroke (0.9%), and no deaths. The total stroke and death rates were 9.7% for the patients in group I and 0.9% for the patients in group II (P = .0015). The cardiopulmonary events that led to additional monitoring were evident after 96 procedures in group I (32.8%) and 21 procedures in group II (17.4%; P = .002).\nPTAS carries a higher neurologic risk and requires more monitoring than CEA in the treatment of patients with carotid artery stenosis with LRA. The proposed benefit for the use of PTAS to avoid general anesthesia cannot be justified when compared with CEA performed with LRA.",

He was initially considered for participation in a trial of early thrombolysis in stroke, but an innominate artery embolus was found with no apparent arterial source. The embolus was removed by means of a combined brachial and carotid bifurcation approach to protect the cerebral vasculature from embolic fragmentation during extraction. Further investigation revealed deep venous thrombosis, evidence of pulmonary emboli, and a patent foramen ovale, supporting a diagnosis of paradoxic embolus. Additional treatment included anticoagulation and placement of an inferior vena caval filter. The unusual condition of paradoxic embolus is reviewed, and the management of this patient is discussed.",

The iliac vein confluence crossed anteriorly (rather then posteriorly) the right common iliac artery. Even though the patient had undergone a computed tomography scan, this rare anomaly had not been detected and therefore was unexpected by the surgeon. The aim of this report is to describe the technical details required to perform the aortic reconstruction and to stress the importance of routine computed tomography scans and their careful reading in the case of stable patients before retroperitoneal operation. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of an aortic prosthetic grafting for ruptured aortic aneurysm in association with a marsupial cava.",

Despite its rarity, early diagnosis is imperative to prevent limb-threatening or fatal complications. The treatment may be complicated, because it must allow for the growth of the child. A saccular AAA in an 11-year-old boy, complicated by three repeated embolizations to the lower extremities and treated by aneurysmorrhaphy 25 years ago, was studied. In addition, the long-term function of a vein interposition graft in the common femoral artery was identified.",

Neither patient had any other atherosclerotic occlusive disease, and both lesions occurred precisely where the extensor pollicis longus crossed the artery and would be expected to compress it against the proximal epiphysis of the first metacarpal when the hand was closed.

This is an unusual cause of digital embolization that should be considered in patients with emboli to the thumb and index finger.",

    "abstract": "Although a number of pharmacologic agents have been shown to reduce intimal hyperplasia in animal models of restenosis, to date no systemic agent has conclusively been shown to be effective in humans. Recently, considerable attention has been directed towards endothelin (ET), a potent vasoconstrictor and a powerful mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells, as a mediator of intimal hyperplasia. Endothelin-1 has been shown to be mitogenic for human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells, and expression also is elevated in human vein graft stenosis. The aim of this study was the investigation of whether ET receptor antagonists can attenuate neointima formation in a laboratory model of vein graft intimal hyperplasia and the determination of whether the effects are mediated by a specific ET receptor subtype.\nWe used an organ culture of human saphenous vein, a well-validated model of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. Paired segments of human long saphenous vein were cultured with and without the following antagonists: bosentan, a nonselective ET receptor antagonist; BQ 123, a specific endothelin-A antagonist; or BQ 788, a specific endothelin-B (ETB) antagonist. After 14 days in the culture, the segments were fixed and processed and the sections were immunostained to facilitate the measurements of neointimal thickness with a computerized image analysis system.\nThe nonselective antagonist bosentan and the ETB selective antagonist BQ 788 significantly reduced neointima formation by 70% (P = .001) and 50% (P = .03), respectively, but the ETA antagonist BQ 123 had no significant effect on the reduction of neointima formation (P = 1.0).\nThe results of this study imply an important role for ET as a mediator of human vein graft intimal hyperplasia and imply further that a specific ETB antagonist may have a therapeutic potential for the prevention of vein graft stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is associated with atheromatosis and is a common finding with diabetes. We have studied the effects of acute hyperglycemia on the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of both the microcirculation and the macrocirculation of healthy subjects. Because of the presence of endothelial dysfunction with diabetes, we hypothesize that acute hyperglycemia causes impaired endothelial-dependent responses.\nTwenty healthy subjects (15 men, 5 women) with a mean age of 32.3 years (range, 23 to 49 years) were examined during fasting conditions and at 1 hour after the ingestion of 75 g of glucose. The endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of the brachial artery, a conduit vessel, was evaluated with high-resolution ultrasound scan to measure the changes in the vessel diameter induced with reactive hyperemia. In the microcirculation, the endothelial function was assessed by measuring the changes in the erythrocyte flux after the acetylcholine iontophoresis.\nThe brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilatation was greater during fasting as compared with the response after the glucose load was administered (11.7% [8.3 to 14.3] vs 4.2% [1.5 to 9.6]; P < .001; median, first, and third quartile). Both peak and average blood flow velocities during the hyperemic response were higher after the administration of the glucose load as compared with the fasting period (P < .05), but no changes were found in the blood flow volume. During fasting, microcirculatory endothelial-dependent vasodilatation was also significantly greater than the response after the administration of the glucose load (1293% [591 to 1856] vs 863% [385 to 1180]; P < .01).\nIn healthy subjects, the ingestion of a glucose load impairs the endothelial-dependent vasodilation in both the microcirculation and the macrocirculation. Because impairment of endothelial responses is associated with the early changes of atherosclerosis, it is possible that prolonged hyperglycemia and endothelial dysfunction may lead to the early and accelerated atherosclerosis of diabetes. Further studies are necessary to examine the long-term effects of hyperglycemia.",

    "abstract": "In vivo and in vitro observations strongly suggest that marked differences exist in the phenotype, growth, and matrix-producing capabilities of distinct smooth muscle cell subpopulations. An earlier study from our laboratory showed differences in matrix metalloproteinase expression patterns in cultures of medial smooth muscle cells from tissue affected by abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or atherosclerotic occlusive disease and from normal arterial tissue. In this study we were interested in ascertaining whether smooth muscle cells from the same sample groups also synthesized different proteoglycan profiles that correlated with vascular disease.\nProteoglycans from smooth muscle cell monolayer cultures from tissue affected by AAA or atherosclerotic occlusive disease and from normal arterial tissue were examined by means of immunoblotting and affinity-blotting composite agarose polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (CAPAGE) and sodium dodecyl sulphate PAGE. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantitate perlecan levels in smooth muscle cell monolayer media samples.\nVersican, perlecan, and biglycan levels were significantly elevated in AAA smooth muscle cell cultures. Two populations of smooth muscle cell versican were identified by means of CAPAGE-immunoblotting and by means of a novel affinity-blotting technique with biotinylated hyaluronan. A small keratan sulfate-substituted proteoglycan was present in similar levels in all smooth muscle cell cultures. This proteoglycan had a free core protein of about 55 kd after keratanase digestion and had a relatively high charge-to-mass ratio, as was evident from its electrophoretic mobility in CAPAGE; this proteoglycan was tentatively identified as keratocan. Immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies 3-G-10 (anti-delta heparan sulfate, heparan sulfate stubs generated by heparitinase treatment) and 10-E-4 (anti-native heparan sulfate chains) helped identify several smooth muscle cell heparan sulfate-substituted proteoglycans. Elevated levels of intact and processed perlecan core protein were identified in AAA cultures by means of immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to perlecan core protein (A76). ELISA measurements confirmed that perlecan levels were significantly higher in AAA smooth muscle cell cultures compared with the normal arterial tissue and tissue affected by atherosclerotic occlusive disease.\nBecause heparan sulfate proteoglycans can bind growth factors, their elevated synthesis by AAA smooth muscle cells in combination with an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases may at least partly explain the differential proliferative capacity of the AAA smooth muscle cells examined and may govern the pattern of abnormal cellular proliferation and matrix protein synthesis observed in the pathogenesis of vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the present study was to examine the role of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the development of varicose changes in the superficial veins of the lower extremity.\nNormal-caliber vein segments from the saphenofemoral junction were harvested from patients undergoing saphenous vein ligation for varices and from patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass graft procedures. The activity and quantity of MMPs and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases [TIMPs]) in the vein segments were compared. Vein segments were obtained from 13 patients. Seven patients had varicose disease in the leg, including 6 women and 1 man (average age, 48 years). Six patients had no evidence of varicose disease, including 2 women and 4 men (average age, 59 years). Proteolytic activity was determined with substrate gel zymography, and enzyme content was determined with Western immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies directed against MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and alpha2-macroglobulin. Signals were quantified by scanning densitometry and normalized to a positive control (densitometric index [DI]). Immunohistochemistry was performed for enzyme localization.\nZymography did not detect a difference between groups at loci consistent with the major MMPs; however, a small but significant decrease in proteolytic activity was noted in veins from patients with varices. TIMP-1 is increased in vein segments from patients with varices (DI 0.8 +/- 0.1 vs 0.2 +/- 0.05, P < .05) while MMP-2 levels were decreased (DI 1.5 +/- 0.3 vs 0.5 +/- 0.1, P < .05). Immunohistochemistry localized MMPs to the adventitia of the vein wall.\nA decrease in proteolytic activity may be responsible for the histological and structural alterations leading to varicose degeneration of superficial lower extremity veins.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that endovascular aortic aneurysm repair might induce a significant inflammatory response, mainly involving tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) release. This study determined in vitro whether these inflammatory responses could depend on white blood cell (WBC) activation caused by the aneurysmal mural thrombus.\nMural thrombus specimens obtained from 10 different aortic aneurysms were weighed, homogenized, and assayed for interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF-alpha, and soluble TNF receptor (sTNFRI).\nOnly high amounts of IL-6 (mean, 2973 pg/mL) were found. In contrast, after the addition of healthy donor WBCs to the thrombus mass supernatants, elevated levels of TNF-alpha (mean, 523 pg/mL) were seen. Theoretically, WBCs were stimulated by IL-6, resulting in TNF-alpha release. In additional experiments, it was proven that stimulated WBCs, induced by thrombus mass supernatants, synthesize TNF-alpha (mean, 796 pg/mL), and monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, prevented such TNF-alpha production (mean, 62 pg/mL).\nThe biologic responses during endovascular repair may be explained by a release of IL-6 from the aneurysmal thrombus, causing WBC stimulation and production of TNF-alpha. More complex processes cannot be excluded, but the present findings suggest that restrictions of manipulations within the aneurysm may be advisable.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a color duplex ultrasound scan (CDU) to a computerized axial tomography scan (CT) in the diagnosis of endoleaks after stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nThe Endovascular Aneurysm Clinical Trial Core Laboratory records were reviewed from 117 concurrent CDU and CT studies that were performed in 79 patients who were implanted with the Endovascular Technologies stent graft device between December 1995 and January 1997. All of the studies were interpreted by the Core Laboratory as having the presence or the absence of an endoleak or as being indeterminate because of technical factors. Of the 117 videotaped CDU studies available for reexamination, 100 were reassessed for technical adequacy on the basis of the following criteria: a satisfactory imaging of the aneurysm sac and of the stent graft with gray scale, and both color and spectral Doppler scan evaluation for endoleak outside the endograft and within the aneurysm sac.\nOf the 117 studies, 103 CDUs (88%) and 114 CTs (97%) were recorded as having the presence or the absence of an endoleak and 14 CDUs (12%) and 3 CTs (3%) were indeterminate. For the studies that were recorded to have the presence or the absence of an endoleak, the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive and the negative predictive values, and the accuracy of CDUs as compared with CTs were 97%, 74%, 66%, 98%, and 82%, respectively. Of the 100 CDU videotaped studies available for review, the following results were seen: (1) 93 CDUs had satisfactory B-mode images, (2) 76 had satisfactory color Doppler scan images to evaluate for endoleaks, (3) 55 had color Doppler scan assessment of the entire abdominal aortic aneurysm sac for endoleak, and (4) 27 had spectral Doppler scan waveform confirmation of suspected endoleaks. Only 19 CDU studies (19%) with all 4 criteria for complete assessment of endoleak were performed.\nAlthough most of the CDU studies were technically suboptimal, the CDUs reliably identified endoleaks with an excellent sensitivity and a negative predictive value as compared with CT scans.",

For these patients, the endograft was delivered through a femoral cutdown in an occluding aortoiliac configuration. The contralateral iliac artery was occluded with an iliac endograft. Axillofemoral bypass grafting was performed. Computed tomographic scans were obtained regularly.\nThere was 1 postoperative death of severe arrhythmia. All aneurysms were found to be affected by thrombosis on immediately postoperative computed tomographic scans, except in 1 patient with a proximal leak, which was managed successfully with angiographic embolization. The mean follow-up time was 12 months. Aortic aneurysm diameter decreased from 2 mm at 6 months (2 patients) to 6 mm at 12 months (6 patients). All axillofemoral bypass grafts are patent.\nPlacement of an occluding endograft associated with axillofemoral bypass grafting is a good alternative for patients at high risk with complex anatomic features.

    "abstract": "Successful endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) requires the creation of a hemostatic seal between the endograft and the underlying aortic wall. A short infrarenal aortic neck may be responsible for incomplete aneurysm exclusion and procedural failure. Sixteen patients who had an endograft positioned completely below the lowest renal artery and 37 patients in whom a porous portion of an endograft attachment system was deliberately placed across the renal arteries were studied to identify if endograft positioning could impact on the occurrence of incomplete aneurysm exclusion.\nFifty-three patients underwent aortic grafting constructed from a Palmaz balloon expandable stent and an expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft implanted in an aorto-ilio-femoral, femoral-femoral configuration. Arteriography, duplex ultrasonography and spiral CT scans were performed in each patient before and after endografting to evaluate for technical success, the presence of endoleaks, and renal artery perfusion.\nThere was no statistically significant difference in patient demography, AAA size, or aortic neck length or diameter between patients who had their endografts placed below or across the renal arteries. However, significantly more proximal aortic endoleaks occurred in those patients with infrarenal endografts (P < or = .05). Median serum creatinine level before and after endografting was not significantly different between the 2 patient subgroups, with the exception of 2 patients who had inadvertent coverage of a single renal orifice by the endograft. Median blood pressure and the requirement for antihypertensive therapy remained the same after transrenal aortic stent grafting. Significant renal artery compromise did not occur after appropriately positioned transrenal stents as shown by means of angiography, CT scanning, and duplex ultrasound scan. Mean follow-up time was 10.3 months (range, 3 to 18 months). Patients who had significant renal artery stenosis (> or =50%) before aortic endografting did not show progression of renal artery stenosis after trans-renal endografting. Two patients with transrenal aortic stent grafts had inadvertent coverage of 1 renal artery by the endograft because of device malpositioning, which resulted in nondialysis dependent renal insufficiency. In addition, evidence of segmental renal artery infarction (<20% of the kidney), which did not result in an apparent change in renal function, was shown by means of follow-up CT scans in 2 patients with transrenal endografts.\nTransrenal aortic endograft fixation using a balloon expandable device in patients with AAAs can result in a significant reduction in the risk of proximal endoleaks. Absolute attention to precise device positioning, coupled with the use of detailed imaging techniques, should reduce the risk of inadvertent renal artery occlusion from malpositioning. Long-term follow-up is essential to determine if there will be late sequelae of transrenal fixation of endografts, which could adversely effect renal perfusion.",

Absolute attention to precise device positioning, coupled with the use of detailed imaging techniques, should reduce the risk of inadvertent renal artery occlusion from malpositioning. Long-term follow-up is essential to determine if there will be late sequelae of transrenal fixation of endografts, which could adversely effect renal perfusion.",

However, significantly more proximal aortic endoleaks occurred in those patients with infrarenal endografts (P < or = .05). Median serum creatinine level before and after endografting was not significantly different between the 2 patient subgroups, with the exception of 2 patients who had inadvertent coverage of a single renal orifice by the endograft. Median blood pressure and the requirement for antihypertensive therapy remained the same after transrenal aortic stent grafting. Significant renal artery compromise did not occur after appropriately positioned transrenal stents as shown by means of angiography, CT scanning, and duplex ultrasound scan. Mean follow-up time was 10.3 months (range, 3 to 18 months). Patients who had significant renal artery stenosis (> or =50%) before aortic endografting did not show progression of renal artery stenosis after trans-renal endografting. Two patients with transrenal aortic stent grafts had inadvertent coverage of 1 renal artery by the endograft because of device malpositioning, which resulted in nondialysis dependent renal insufficiency. In addition, evidence of segmental renal artery infarction (<20% of the kidney), which did not result in an apparent change in renal function, was shown by means of follow-up CT scans in 2 patients with transrenal endografts.",

    "abstract": "The long-term risk for recurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) after long-term anticoagulation (LTA) therapy have been widely debated. In this study, we compare the results of short-term anticoagulation therapy versus conventional LTA therapy in patients with DVT of the lower extremity.\nBaseline assessments of DVT symptoms and risk factors were recorded in 105 patients. Diagnosis was made using duplex ultrasound/venography. Patients were sequentially assigned to 1 of the following treatment protocols: (A) conventional LTA therapy, which included initial intravenous standard heparin followed by warfarin on days 3 to 5 and was continued for 3 months for patients without pulmonary embolism (PE); or (B) short-term therapy, which included the same heparin therapy followed by warfarin on days 2 to 3 and was continued for 6 weeks only. Clinical and duplex ultrasound follow-up was done at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter.\nRisk factors, location of DVT, and mean age of the 2 groups were comparable. Mean follow-up was 59 months. There were 4 immediate major complications in patients of group A (4 of 54 [7%]; 2 PEs and 2 significant bleeds) and 3 in patients of group B (3 of 51 [6%]; 1 PE and 2 bleeds). On long-term follow-up, 18 of 43 (42%) patients in group A and 20 of 44 (46%) patients in group B had PTS. Similarly, 10 of 43 (23%) patients in group A and 9 of 44 (20%) patients in group B had 1 or more recurrent thromboembolic events (not statistically significant). A significant difference was demonstrated only in patients with cancer; LTA was favored in reducing recurrent DVT and PTS. Two other patients in group A had late significant complications secondary to warfarin (hemorrhage in 1 and coumadin necrosis in the other), with no complications in group B. The mean number of days of hospitalization were fewer for patients in group B (5 versus 8 days), which is mainly due to earlier initiation of warfarin therapy for group B.\nIn this study of our local population, we observed that short-term anticoagulation therapy was as effective as LTA therapy and less costly for use in most patients. It may also carry less risk of long-term warfarin complications, such as bleeding or skin necrosis.",

Baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and its prolongation after the addition of a standard amount of APC were determined. The factor V R506Q gene mutation (Leiden) was analyzed in patients with an APC ratio less than 3.0. Statistical comparisons were made to an age-matched control population (n = 278).\nThe factor V Leiden gene mutation or abnormal APC ratio was detected in 154 of the patients (22.7%), compared with 34 of 278 the control subjects (12.2%; t = 13.65; P < .001). The factor V Leiden gene mutation was found in 102 patients (15.2%), compared with 29 control subjects (10.4%; t = 4.64; P < .05); an abnormal APC ratio was found in 132 patients (19.8%), compared with 26 (9.8%) of controls (t = 14.56; P < .001).

Overall, 63% of the patients with abnormal APC ratios tested positive for the factor V Leiden gene mutation. A significantly increased frequency of APC resistance was demonstrated in patients undergoing aorto-iliac (n = 37) or femoro-crural graft reconstructions (n = 72); it was found in 41% and 35%, respectively (P < .001). In addition, a significantly increased frequency of APC resistance was found in patients who suffered from occlusion after reconstruction; 13 of 41 (32%) had the factor V Leiden gene mutation (P < .001), and 19 of 39 (49%) had an abnormal APC ratio (P < .001).\nThe factor V Leiden gene mutation and abnormal APC ratios are significantly increased in patients with lower extremity peripheral vascular disease and failed reconstructions.

    "abstract": "To delineate management strategies and outcomes for true aneurysms involving arteries of the upper extremity distal to the axillary artery. The management of these rare lesions has not been well established in the literature.\nRetrospective chart review was performed at tertiary referral centers. All patients who received the diagnosis of true upper extremity aneurysms distal to the axillary artery between 1975 and 1995 were included in the review. Nineteen patients were found; seven were excluded because no confirmatory diagnostic imaging study or operative exploration was performed. This represents the largest reported series of true upper extremity arterial aneurysms.\nTwelve patients (9 men or boys) had 12 confirmed true aneurysms of the brachial or more distal arteries. The average diameters were as follows: brachial artery 4.6 cm, radial artery 2.0 cm, ulnar artery 1.4 cm, and digital artery 0.8 cm. The mean age was 51 years (range, 10 to 86 years). The most common presentation was the presence of a mass. This occurred among eight patients (67%). Four patients (33%) reported pain or paresthesia. One patient (8%) had cold intolerance only. Three patients (25%) had thromboembolic complications. Complications did not consistently correlate with size or presence of intramural thrombus. Three aneurysms (25%) were initially managed nonoperatively and followed for a mean period of 71 months. One of these required operative repair after 5 months because of progressive pain. Ten patients (83%) were treated surgically as follows: five underwent ligation and excision only, and five underwent excision and revascularization. Morbidity was minimal, and there were no perioperative deaths.\nTrue arterial aneurysms of the upper extremity distal to the axillary artery are rare and most commonly caused by blunt trauma. Fifty-eight percent of these lesions present with symptoms or complications. Thirty-three percent of asymptomatic lesions later become symptomatic. These factors combined with the minimal morbidity associated with repair suggest that operative repair should be routinely performed for these aneurysms. Revascularization can be performed selectively.",

The average diameters were as follows: brachial artery 4.6 cm, radial artery 2.0 cm, ulnar artery 1.4 cm, and digital artery 0.8 cm. The mean age was 51 years (range, 10 to 86 years). The most common presentation was the presence of a mass. This occurred among eight patients (67%). Four patients (33%) reported pain or paresthesia. One patient (8%) had cold intolerance only. Three patients (25%) had thromboembolic complications. Complications did not consistently correlate with size or presence of intramural thrombus. Three aneurysms (25%) were initially managed nonoperatively and followed for a mean period of 71 months. One of these required operative repair after 5 months because of progressive pain. Ten patients (83%) were treated surgically as follows: five underwent ligation and excision only, and five underwent excision and revascularization. Morbidity was minimal, and there were no perioperative deaths.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that 11% to 18% of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have a first-degree relative with an AAA. A familial pattern among patients with peripheral arterial aneurysms and arteriomegaly has not been reported. The objective of this study was to examine familial patterns among patients with peripheral arterial aneurysm and arteriomegaly and compare them with patterns among patients with AAA.\nPedigrees were constructed for first-degree relatives of patients who received the diagnosis of peripheral arterial aneurysm, arteriomegaly, or AAA from 1988 through 1996. The presence of aneurysms and risk factors was confirmed for patients and relatives by means of telephone interviews and review of hospital and physician records.\nSeven hundred three first-degree relatives older than 50 years were contacted for 140 probands with peripheral arterial aneurysm, AAA, or arteriomegaly. There were differences in risk factors for hernia and diabetes mellitus among the probands with peripheral arterial aneurysm, AAA, or arteriomegaly but none for relatives. Patients with peripheral arterial aneurysm (n = 40) had a 10% (4/40) familial incidence rate of an aneurysm, patients with AAA (n = 86) had a 22% (19/86) familial incidence rate, and patients with arteriomegaly (n = 14) had a 36% (5/14) familial incidence rate. AAA (24/28, or 86%) was the aneurysm diagnosed most commonly among first-degree relatives. Most aneurysms (85%) occurred among men.\nThere appears to be a gradation of familial patterns from peripheral arterial aneurysm to AAA to arteriomegaly among patients with degenerative aneurysmal disease, and there appears to be a predominance among men. Relatives of patients with any of the 3 lesions-peripheral arterial aneurysm, AAA, arteriomegaly--most frequently have AAA. Relatives of patients with AAA, peripheral arterial aneurysm, or arteriomegaly may be screened by means of a physical examination for peripheral aneurysmal disease. Screening by means of ultrasound examination of the aorta should be limited to first-degree relatives of patients with aortic aneurysms or arteriomegaly.",

    "abstract": "Although some authors advocate hypothermic circulatory arrest for spinal cord protection in descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal repair, this method has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in other studies. The safety and effectiveness of this surgical adjunct were evaluated.\nBetween February 1991 and April 1997, 409 patients underwent thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic repair. Because of an inability to gain proximal aortic control because of anatomic or technical difficulty, hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 21 patients (4.9%). Thirteen patients were men, 8 were women, and the median age was 57 (range, 21 to 81 years). Four patients (19%) had Marfan's syndrome, and 1 had aortitis. Seven patients (33%) had aortic dissection (4 chronic type A, 2 chronic type B, 1 acute B), and 1 had aortic laceration. All but 6 patients had hypertension. Fifteen patients (73%) were operated on for repair of the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta, 4 (19%) for repair of the distal arch and thoracoabdominal aorta, and 2 for repair of either the thoracoabdominal or descending thoracic aorta alone. Surgery for 9 patients (43%) also included bypass grafts to the subclavian or innominate arteries. Six operations (29%) were urgent.\nThe overall 30-day mortality rate was 29% (6 of 21 patients). Among urgent patients, the mortality rate was 50% (3 of 6 patients) versus 20% (3 of 15) for elective patients. Of the remaining 15 patients, renal failure occurred in 1 (7%) and heart failure in 2 (13%). Ten patients (67%) had pulmonary complications. Encephalopathy occurred in 5 patients (33%) and stroke in 2 (13%), and spinal cord neurologic deficit developed in 2 (13%). The median recovery was 28 days (range, 10 to 157 days).\nHypothermic circulatory arrest did not reduce the incidence of deaths and morbidity to a rate comparable with our conventional methods. We recommend the judicious application of this method in rare instances when proximal control is not feasible or catastrophic intraoperative bleeding leave the surgeon with no other option.",

    "abstract": "This study is an analysis of the outcome of a common method of management of the external carotid artery (ECA) during routine carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nBetween 1986 and 1997, 1069 primary CEAs were performed with a combination of proximal eversion technique and blind distal endarterectomy on the ECA. Of these, 973 CEAs (91%) had 1 or more postoperative duplex scans that included the ECA. Both preoperative and early postoperative studies were performed on 313 of these CEAs. Intraoperative post-CEA continuous-wave Doppler scans identified low flow or occlusion of the ECA in 37 CEAs (4%). These ECAs were isolated and repaired.\nThe early post-CEA duplex scan velocities were 143 +/- 81 cm/s (mean +/- 1 standard deviation of the mean). In the first 6 months after the CEAs, 692 ECAs (72%) had <50% stenosis, 175 (18%) had 50% to 74% stenosis, 90 (9%) had > or =75% stenosis, and 9 (1%) were occluded. Of the 37 repaired ECAs, 20 (54%) had <50% stenosis, 10 (27%) had 50% to 74% stenosis, 5 (14%) had > or =75% stenosis, and 2 (5%) were occluded.

The repair of severely obstructed or occluded ECA identified during surgery after CEA has a similarly poor outcome. The technique and management of the ECA during routine CEA needs further investigation and modification.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction and other comorbidities contribute to complications after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, because the combined stroke and death rate after CEA is less than 5%, even relatively large series have small numbers of adverse events that preclude a detailed analysis of the association between the outcome and the patient factors, such as comorbidity and age. We sought to overcome this limitation by studying patients who underwent CEA in a large random sample of Medicare beneficiaries.\nWe used a database that contained a 20% random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries to identify patients who underwent CEA between the years 1988 to 1990 (n = 22,165), and we followed these cases until 1992. With multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models, we examined the impact of age, race, gender, geographic location, hospital characteristics, and comorbidity, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), on the risk of stroke and death after CEA.\nAMI and CHF had the greatest negative impact on the long-term survival rates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.40, P < .0001, and 2.85, P < .0001, respectively). Other variables with a significant impact on the long-term survival rates were an age of >80 years (HR, 2.16; P < .0001), an acute stroke (HR, 1.51; P < .0001), diabetes mellitus (DM; HR, 1.52; P < .0001), and male sex (HR, 1.32; P < .0001). In addition, AMI, CHF, DM, and advanced age were associated with an increased risk of perioperative stroke and death.\nPatients with AMI, CHF, DM, and an age of >80 years have diminished perioperative and long-term survival rates after CEA. These results may alter the risk/benefit analysis for such patients, especially those with asymptomatic disease.",

    "abstract": "True aneurysm formation in arterialized autologous veins is an unusual complication. We studied a patient with 2 aneurysms occurring in the mid and distal portion of an in situ femoropopliteal bypass. The first aneurysm led to graft occlusion 4 years after the primary intervention, requiring replacement of the ectatic graft segment. The graft was still patent when the patient was examined 7 years after the primary intervention and 3 years after the first aneurysm. In the mid portion of the graft, a true aneurysm measuring 5 by 8 cm had developed. The aneurysm was replaced by a reversed segment of the contralateral greater saphenous vein. Recovery was uneventful. Advanced atherosclerotic changes with extensive intimal fibroplasia, subendothelial cholesterol deposits, and ulcerations were revealed by means of histopathology of the aneurysm wall. Atherosclerosis is considered to be the main cause of aneurysm formation in vein grafts, but a review of the literature suggests the additional etiopathogenic factors should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Malignant aortic tumors occur infrequently. At least 70 cases of primary aortic malignancies have been reported in the literature. Within this group, chondrosarcoma is exceedingly rare, with only 1 case having been reported. An aortic chondrosarcoma developed in our patient and embolized to the small bowel and lower extremities. Although initially thought to arise from the abdominal aorta, this tumor, in fact, originated from the thoracic aorta. This case illustrates the need for complete aortic imaging when unexplained recurrent embolization occurs. In general, the survival rates with chondrosarcoma are diminished, but this patient survived 69 months after he was initially seen.",

    "abstract": "Veins develop unique endothelial and smooth muscle cell physiologic phenotypes after implantation as vein grafts in the arterial circulation. Receptor-mediated relaxation is reduced or absent in these grafts. This study examines the responses of vein grafts to adenosine, a known potent endogenous vasodilator, and compares these responses with the native veins and arteries.\nThe presence of adenosine receptors (A1 and A2) by radioligand binding and the in vitro responses to the adenosine analogue N-ethyl-carboxyamido-adenosine were assessed in precontracted common carotid jugular vein bypass grafts placed in New Zealand white rabbits for 28 days. Results were compared with those obtained in precontracted jugular veins and carotid arteries. Both endothelialized and de-endothelialized vessels were studied. The contribution of nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoid production to relaxation was also determined by preincubation with the specific inhibitors l-monomethylarginine and indomethacin, respectively. Finally, the in vitro relaxation in response to the respective A1 and A2 adenosine receptor agonists R-phenyl-isopropyl-adenosine and CGS-21680 was also examined.\nThe results show that the adenosine-induced responses of the vein grafts differ from those of the jugular vein and carotid artery. First, in contrast to the carotid artery, vein graft adenosine-mediated relaxation is NO and prostanoid dependent, similar to the response of the jugular vein. Second, A1 receptor activation in the vein graft produces an endothelium-dependent contractile response. Third, the A2 receptor-mediated responses in the vein grafts appear to be independent of the endothelium. Fourth, radioligand studies show the presence of both receptor subtypes (A1 and A2) on the vein grafts with a ratio (A1/A2 = 1.4) closer to that of the jugular vein (A1/A2 = 1.8) than to that seen in the carotid artery (A1/A2 = 0.5).\nVein graft adenosine responses appear to be unique in that they neither maintain a venous phenotype nor acquire an arterial phenotype. In particular, endothelial A1 receptor-mediated responses change from relaxation to contraction, and receptor activated NO-mediated relaxation is preserved within the vein grafts probably via A2 receptor signalling.",

    "abstract": "In a rabbit model, transposition of a muscle pedicle flap to an ischemic hind limb has been shown to result in the development of new blood vessels that connect the arterial circulation of the flap to the circulation of the limb. The hypothesis that exogenous recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) would enhance the development of this new blood supply was examined and the regulation of bFGF in this process was investigated.\nThe right common iliac artery was ligated in 12 male New Zealand white rabbits. An abdominal wall muscle flap based on the left inferior epigastric artery was transposed to the right thigh. bFGF in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 3 ng/h (n = 6), or PBS alone (n = 6), was infused for 7 days via mini-osmotic pumps with an infusion catheter positioned at the flap-muscle interface. The flap-muscle interface was immunostained with anti-alpha-actin antibody to determine blood vessel density (number of vessels/mm) and with anti-bFGF antibody to evaluate bFGF distribution. RNA was isolated from these sections, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine endogenous bFGF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression.\nBlood vessel density was significantly increased in animals receiving exogenous bFGF (22. 0 +/- 10.6 vessels/mm vs. 10.7 +/- 8.8 vessels/mm, P =.009). In the controls, neovessels were arranged in clusters with endogenous bFGF concentrated around these clusters. In bFGF-treated animals, vessels were diffusely scattered throughout the flap-limb interface, corresponding to the distribution pattern of infused bFGF. There was no difference in bFGF mRNA expression between the control and the bFGF-treated groups.\nExogenous bFGF infusion significantly augmented new blood vessel development at the flap-limb interface. Endogenous bFGF was up-regulated around the newly developed microvessels in control animals, and vessel growth correlated with the diffuse distribution of exogenous bFGF, implicating bFGF as an important factor in angiogenesis. Exogenous bFGF did not affect bFGF mRNA expression, suggesting that the regulation of bFGF is not under autocrine control.",

The animals underwent anesthesia, and a left common CEA was performed. After 14 days, the serum H(e) levels were measured and the left carotid artery was harvested and elastin stained. Morphometric measurements were used to calculate the area of stenosis of the lumen. The mean and the standard deviation of the mean were determined. The 2 groups were compared with the Mann-Whitney test and a linear regression model. Three additional rats per group were studied, with carotid artery sectioning with double immunohistochemical staining for 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and alpha-smooth muscle (alpha-SM) actin.\nThe serum H(e) level in the H(e) group was 36.32 micromol/L +/- 15.28, and in the control group the level was 5.53 micromol/L +/- 2.06 (P =.0007). IH presented as percent lumen stenosis was 21.89% +/- 4.82% in the H(e) group and 4.82% +/- 1.64% in the control group (P =.0007). The linear regression model of the serum H(e) levels and the percent stenosis showed a linear relationship (r2 =.72). The alpha-SM actin staining revealed that nearly all of the cells in the IH area were of smooth muscle or myofibroblast origin and that 10.1% +/- 2.6% of the cells were stained for BrdU in the control group versus 23% +/- 7.1% in the H(e) group.

The consistent elevation of serum H(e) levels was associated with more than 4 times the amount of IH after a CEA in a rat model.",

    "abstract": "Outcome and venous patency after reconstruction in major pelvic and extremity venous injuries was studied.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 46 patients with 47 venous injuries.\nInjuries were caused by penetrating trauma in 37 extremities, blunt trauma in 6 patients, and were iatrogenic in 4 patients. Pelvic veins were injured in 4 patients, lower-extremity veins were injured in 39 limbs in 38 patients, and upper-extremity veins were injured in 4 patients. Concomitant arterial injuries occurred in 37 patients. Venous repairs were mostly of the complex type and included spiral or panel grafts in 15 (32%) reconstructions, interposition grafts or patch venoplasty in 19 (40%) reconstructions, end-to-end and lateral repair in 11 patients, and ligation in 2 patients. Two patients underwent early amputation. Early transient limb edema occurred in 2 patients, and postoperative venous occlusions were documented in 4 patients. Full function was regained in 39 (81%) extremities. No variable, including 4 retrospectively applied extremity injury scores (mangled extremity severity score [MESS], limb salvage index [LSI], mangled extremity syndrome index [MESI], predictive salvage index [PSI]), correlated with outcome. High values on all 4 scores were significantly associated with reexplorations (P <.02), which were done in 8 patients for debridement (5), arrest of bleeding (2), and repair of a missed arterial injury (1). Follow-up of 28 +/- 6 months on 27 patients (57%; duplex scan in 18, continuous-wave Doppler and plethysmography in 9, and venography in 3) showed 1 occlusion 6 weeks after the injury and patency of all other venous reconstructions.\nReconstructions of major venous injuries with a high rate of complex repairs result in a large proportion of fully functional limbs and a high patency rate. A high extremity injury score predicts the need for reexploration of the extremity. Mostocclusions occur within weeks of injury, and the subsequent delayed occlusion rate is very low.",

    "results": "Injuries were caused by penetrating trauma in 37 extremities, blunt trauma in 6 patients, and were iatrogenic in 4 patients. Pelvic veins were injured in 4 patients, lower-extremity veins were injured in 39 limbs in 38 patients, and upper-extremity veins were injured in 4 patients. Concomitant arterial injuries occurred in 37 patients. Venous repairs were mostly of the complex type and included spiral or panel grafts in 15 (32%) reconstructions, interposition grafts or patch venoplasty in 19 (40%) reconstructions, end-to-end and lateral repair in 11 patients, and ligation in 2 patients. Two patients underwent early amputation. Early transient limb edema occurred in 2 patients, and postoperative venous occlusions were documented in 4 patients. Full function was regained in 39 (81%) extremities. No variable, including 4 retrospectively applied extremity injury scores (mangled extremity severity score [MESS], limb salvage index [LSI], mangled extremity syndrome index [MESI], predictive salvage index [PSI]), correlated with outcome. High values on all 4 scores were significantly associated with reexplorations (P <.02), which were done in 8 patients for debridement (5), arrest of bleeding (2), and repair of a missed arterial injury (1). Follow-up of 28 +/- 6 months on 27 patients (57%; duplex scan in 18, continuous-wave Doppler and plethysmography in 9, and venography in 3) showed 1 occlusion 6 weeks after the injury and patency of all other venous reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the present study was to assess the immediate effect of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in patients with intermittent claudication.\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Inclusion criteria consisted of history of intermittent claudication, resting ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) of 1.00 or less, a 20% or greater fall in ABPI after exercise, and maximum walking distance (MWD) of less than 250 m. Patients already receiving nitrates were excluded. In study 1, patients (n = 25) underwent a standard exercise test after randomization to receive either 800 microg of sublingual GTN or placebo. The postexercise ABPI was recorded. Then, the crossover portion of the study was performed. In study 2, patients (n = 22) had their claudication distance and MWD measured. They then were randomized to receive either GTN or placebo spray, and the exercise test was repeated, with the claudication distance and MWD recorded, followed by the crossover portion of the study. Statistical analysis was performed with the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test and the Mann-Whitney U test.\nIn study 1, the median postexercise ABPIs for placebo and GTN were 0.29 and 0.36 (P =.0001). In study 2, the median claudication distance for both placebo and GTN groups was 70 m (P =.59). The median MWD for the placebo and GTN groups was 105 and 125 m (P =.0084)\nGTN can decrease the fall in ABPI after exercise and increase the MWD.",

    "abstract": "The long-term success of the endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is dependent on the secure fixation of the stent graft at the proximal and distal attachment sites. A progressive dilatation of the infrarenal neck may jeopardize this success. The data regarding this issue are scarce. However, the long-term fate of the infrarenal neck can be studied in patients who have undergone open aneurysm surgery. This was the purpose of the present investigation.\nBetween January 1989 and December 1993, 64 patients underwent open repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. Of the 36 patients who were eligible for the study, 19 had preoperative computed tomography scans that were available. The 19 patients also underwent a new computed tomography scanning at a mean of 71 +/- 12 months after surgery.\nThe mean preoperative aortic diameter was 25.4 +/- 3.7 mm at the infrarenal neck, 24.8 +/- 3.4 mm at the level of the renal arteries, and 26.7 +/- 3.0 mm at the level of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The mean aortic diameter increased at all of the 3 levels: +2.8 +/- 3.1 mm (P =.0014) at the infrarenal neck, +2.8 +/- 3.0 mm (P =.0013) at the level of the renal arteries, and +1.3 +/- 3.0 mm (P = .080) at the level of the SMA. The annual growth rate was 0.48 mm/y (P = .0023) at the infrarenal neck, 0.46 mm/y (P =.0010) at the level of the renal arteries, and 0.21 mm/y (P = .5811) at the level of the SMA. No correlation was found between the preoperative infrarenal neck diameter (r = .295, P = .2194), the preoperative aortic diameter at the level of the renal arteries (r = .302, P = .2088), and the preoperative aortic diameter at the level of the SMA (r = .314, P =. 2043) and the corresponding growth rates. The patients were stratified into 2 groups one with a small annual growth rate at the infrarenal neck (n = 11; </= 0.3 mm/y) and one with a larger annual growth rate (n = 8; > 0.3 mm/y) and no differences in the preoperative infrarenal neck diameter or the clinical characteristics were found between the groups.\nThis investigation shows an aortic dilatation of the infrarenal neck and of the aorta at the level of the renal arteries of approximately 0.5 mm annually after open aneurysm surgery. This dilatation raises concern regarding the long-term success after endovascular repair. The data also indicate that 2 populations might exist with regard to the annual growth rate of the infrarenal neck one with low growth rate and one with higher growth rate. This might be of interest for the future selection of patients for endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "The decision of whether to repair small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), which are those that are less than 5 cm in diameter, remains controversial.\nWe describe 161 consecutive patients who were seen at a single urban hospital with ruptured AAAs (rAAAs) and in whom aneurysm size was measured with ultrasound scanning, or rarely computed tomography, en route to the operating room. Eleven patients (6.8%) had AAAs that measured less than 5.0 cm. This group was compared with 150 patients who had rAAAs that were more than 5 cm.\nThe mortality rates were similar in both of the groups 70% for small rAAAs versus 66% for large rAAAs. No significant differences were seen between the patients with small and large ruptured aneurysms with respect to the prevalence rates of hypertension (60% vs 50%) or of cardiac disease (20% vs 22%). However, the prevalence rate of obstructive lung disease was significantly different (64% vs 25%; P =.02) as was the rate of diabetes (28% vs 3%; P =.004). Five aneurysms were measured at exactly 5 cm. This suggests that approximately 10% of all aneurysms that rupture in this series do so at 5 cm or less.\nIn view of the safety of elective repair as compared with the prohibitive risk associated with aneurysm rupture, patients who are at good risk with small AAA (between 4 and 5 cm) should be considered for elective aneurysm resection. For unclear reasons, obstructive lung disease and diabetes are associated with a significantly greater risk for rupture of small AAA. Patients with these risk factors should be given special consideration.",

    "abstract": "A well-recognized characteristic of venous ulcers is impaired healing. Fibroblasts cultured from venous ulcers (wound-fb) have been shown to have reduced growth rates and are larger than normal fibroblasts (normal-fb) from the ipsilateral limb. Reduced growth capacity and morphologic changes are 2 well-known traits of cellular senescence. Other molecular changes are overexpression of matrix proteins, such as cellular fibronectin (cFN), and enhanced activity of beta-galactosidase at pH of 6.0 (senescence associated beta-Gal, or SA-beta-Gal). Senescence, an irreversible arrest of cell proliferation with maintenance of metabolic functions, may represent in vivo aging and thus may be related to impaired healing.\nCultured normal-fb and wound-fb from 7 venous ulcer patients (average age, 51 years) were obtained by taking punch biopsies of the perimeter of the ulcer and from the ipsilateral thigh of the same patient. Growth rates, SA-beta-Gal activity, and level of cFN protein (immunoblot) and message (Northern blot) were measured.\nIn all patients, wound-fb growth rates were significantly lower than those of normal-fb (P =.006). A higher percentage of SA-beta-Gal positive cells were found in all wound-fb (average, 6.3% vs. 0.21%; P =.016). The level of cFN, was consistently higher in all wound-fb tested. Also, in 4 patients, the level of cFN messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased.\nFibroblasts cultured from venous ulcers exhibited characteristics associated with senescent cells. Accumulation of senescent cell in ulcer environment may be associated with impaired healing.",

    "abstract": "This case series describes the early radiographic and clinical results of attempted transcatheter ovarian vein (OV) embolization in 11 women with symptoms that were suggestive of the pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).\nEleven women (mean age, 33.1 years) who were multiparous were referred for lower extremity or vulvar varicosities (n = 8) or for tubo-ovarian varicosities (n = 3). After a clinical diagnosis of PCS was established, the women underwent ovarian (n = 5) or ovarian and iliac vein (n = 6) venography. Enlarged or incompetent OVs were embolized with 0.035-inch stainless steel coils or with 0.018-inch platinum microcoils and absorbable gelatin sponge. Incompetent tributaries to hypogastric veins were embolized as well (n = 1). Symptoms before embolization and after embolization were recorded with a standard questionnaire, and the post-embolization symptoms were expressed as individual and overall percent relief.\nNine of the 11 women underwent embolization. Embolization of both OVs (n = 4), of the left OV alone (n = 4), or of a left obturator vein that communicated with vulvar varices (n = 1) was performed. Eight of the 9 women (88.9%) had more than 80% immediate relief. Overall and individual symptom relief varied from 40% to 100% at the mean 13.4-month follow-up. One woman with variant anatomy and one woman with evidence of prior left OV thrombosis were not treated. There were no major complications. Two women had a mild to moderate return of the symptoms at 6 and 22 months.\nTranscatheter embolization provides excellent initial and variable midterm relief in women with typical PCS symptoms and with OV or OV and internal iliac (hypogastric) tributary vein incompetence. This interventional technique may replace or complement the traditional surgical approaches to this rarely recognized and poorly understood disease.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle reactivity is one of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of varicose veins. We investigated the myotropic effects of the 3 main vasoconstrictor agents norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (Ang II), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in isolated human saphenous veins.\nHuman saphenous veins were collected from 23 patients with primary chronic venous insufficiency who underwent elective varicose vein resections and who were stratified into the following 3 groups: group 1, 7 patients in clinical class 2; group 2, 9 patients in clinical classes 3 and 4; and group 3, 7 patients in clinical classes 5 and 6. Moreover, 6 patients who underwent arterial bypass grafting procedures represented the control group. The tissues were suspended in organ baths that contained Krebs solution, and their mechanical responses were measured isometrically. The cumulative concentration-response curves to Ang II, NE, and ET-1 were performed at 90-minute intervals in each tissue.\nIn the control tissues, NE, Ang II, and ET-1 induced concentration-dependent contractions with apparent affinities (pEC50, the negative logarithm to base 10 of the molar concentration of the agonist, which produces the 50% of the maximal effect) and maximal effects (maximum effect, g of contraction) that were equal to 7.06 +/- 0.23, 8.53 +/- 0.34, 7.63 +/- 0.10, and 2.21 +/- 0.33, 1.65 +/- 0.31, 2.60 +/- 0.77, respectively. Two main findings were evident in comparison of varicose veins with control tissues. First, the maximum effect that was evoked by all of the stimulants was reduced progressively with the increasing severity of the disease, which raised the third group to statistical significance for both NE and Ang II (P <.05). Second, a marked reduction of Ang II apparent affinity was already evident in tissues that were taken from patients in an early stage of the disease (P <.05).\nThe demonstration of a significant reduction in Ang II and NE contractile activities and the important reduction of that of ET-1 in the diseased veins as compared with the control tissues extends the previous observations regarding the impairment of smooth muscle contractility in primary chronic venous insufficiency. Moreover, the dramatic reduction of Ang II affinity, which appears in an early stage of the disease, supports the hypothesis that such abnormality within the venous wall could play a role in the pathogenesis of primary varicose vein disease.",

    "abstract": "Venous thrombosis results in a vein wall inflammatory response initiated by thrombus. Although anticoagulation with standard heparin (SH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is known to limit further thrombosis, their anti-inflammatory properties are poorly defined. The anti-inflammatory properties of these heparins were studied.\nSprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups and underwent inferior vena caval (IVC) ligation just below the renal level producing IVC thrombosis. One hour before ligation, animals received subcutaneous SH or LMWH at either high or low dose; normal saline (NS) was used as control. Six hours after ligation, animals were killed, and the IVCs were analyzed for clot presence, vein wall morphometrics, and vein wall permeability (VP) to define injury.\nAnimals in both low-dose groups had no measurable anticoagulation, whereas those in both high-dose groups were adequately anticoagulated. There were statistically less IVC neutrophils for all groups compared with the control group, with low-dose LMWH showing the least cells (low-dose LMWH, 16 +/- 3; high-dose LMWH, 37 +/- 10; low-dose SH, 37 +/- 6; high-dose SH, 32 +/- 9; NS control, 63 +/- 2). Similar results were noted for total inflammatory cells. The lowest VP was noted for low-dose LMWH.\nAlthough both SH and LMWH inhibited vein wall neutrophils and total inflammatory cells, low-dose LMWH was most effective limiting neutrophil extravasation and was the only intervention to decrease VP below control levels. This occurred without preventing thrombus formation or causing a state of anticoagulation. Low-dose LMWH possesses anti-inflammatory properties distinct from its anticoagulant properties.",

The effects of perforator interruption, with or without ablation of superficial venous reflux, on venous function in patients with advanced chronic venous insufficiency was studied.\nCalf muscle pump function, venous incompetence, and outflow obstruction were assessed by means of strain-gauge plethysmography (SGP) before and within 6 months after subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS). SEPS was performed with laparoscopic instrumentation and CO2 insufflation. Concomitant high ligation or saphenous vein stripping was performed in 24 limbs (77%).\nTwenty-six patients, 18 women and 8 men, with a mean age of 50 years (range, 20 to 77 years) underwent SEPS. Preoperative evaluation confirmed superficial reflux in 65% of limbs, deep venous reflux in 77% of limbs, and perforator incompetence in 97% of limbs. All limbs had advanced venous dysfunction (C3, C4, C5, C6). All active ulcers (C6, n = 12) healed after surgery (mean, 32 +/- 3 days), and only 1 recurred during a mean follow-up period of 11 months (range, 1 to 43 months). Clinical score improved from 6.58 +/- 0.50 to 2.19 +/- 0.25 (P <.0001). Improved calf muscle pump function was demonstrated by means of postoperative SGP and was indicated by increased refill volume (RV: 0.27 +/- 0.06 vs 0.64 +/- 0.10 mL/100 mL tissue, P <.01). Venous incompetence also improved, as evidenced by prolonged duration to refill after exercise (T90: 7. 71 +/- 1.20 vs 16.71 +/- 1.98 seconds, P <.001) and a decrease in RV after passive drainage (3.23 +/- 0.19 vs 2.63 +/- 0.15 mL/100 mL tissue, P <.01). Improved refill rate (RR) correlated with improvements in clinical scores (P <.01, r = 0.77).\nSEPS with ablation of superficial reflux improved calf muscle pump function, reduced venous incompetence, and produced excellent midterm clinical results.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between the presenting features of an acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), the subsequent natural history of the thrombus, and the ultimate outcome as defined according to the Society for Vascular Surgery and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery reporting standards in venous disease.\nPatients with an acute DVT were followed with serial clinical and ultrasound examinations. Thrombus extent within 7 venous segments was scored retrospectively according to the reporting standards (scores ranged from 0 to 3), and segmental reflux was scored as present (1) or not present (0). The initial and final thrombus scores, the rates of recanalization and rethrombosis, and the total reflux scores were then calculated from these grading scales and related to ultimate chronic venous disease (CVD) classification.\nSixty-eight patients with an acute DVT in 73 limbs were followed for 18 to 110 months (mean, 55 +/- 26 months). At the completion of the follow-up period, 20 extremities (27%) were asymptomatic (class 0), 13 (18%) had pain or prominent superficial veins (class 1), 25 (34%) had manifested edema (class 3), 13 (18%) had developed hyperpigmentation (class 4), and 2 (3%) had developed ulceration (class 5). In a univariate analysis, CVD classification was correlated with the reflux score (P =.003) but not with the initial or final thrombus score or with the rate of recanalization or rethrombosis.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the investigation of the prevalence and distribution of incompetent perforating veins (IPVs) in patients with different classes of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) as defined by the updated clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathologic classification (CEAP) in relation to the pattern and the extent of venous reflux.\nThe study included 468 limbs of 330 subjects who ranged in age from 18 to 101 years (median, 49 years). The investigation entailed a medical history, a clinical examination, and color flow duplex imaging of the lower limb veins, which were performed by the same vascular surgeon operator. The patients were classified into 7 clinical classes according to CEAP. The superficial and deep venous systems were scanned, with an emphasis on the detection of IPVs. Venous reflux was considered abnormal when its duration exceeded 0.5 seconds. IPVs were classified as medial, posterior, and anterolateral in the upper, middle, or lower third of the thigh or calf (9 thigh and 9 calf fields).\nThe IPVs were found mainly in the medial aspect, more frequently in the middle third of calf, followed by the lower calf and the middle thigh. IPVs were rare in the lateral aspect of the thigh, the medial upper and posterior lower thigh and the posterior upper and lower calf. The prevalence of the IPVs and of deep vein incompetence increased significantly with the clinical severity of CVI (r =.95, P <.01, and r =.9, P <.01, respectively). In the limbs with a documented perforating vein (PV) incompetence, the ratios of calf-to-thigh IPVs and of superficial-and-deep (S + D) over superficial-alone (S; [S + D]/S] venous incompetence increase significantly (r =.87, P <.01 and r =.9, P <.01, respectively) with CEAP grade. The prevalence of reflux involving all systems (S + D + PV) increases significantly (r =.9, P <.01) with clinical severity. In legs with CVI of CEAP 2 to 6, reflux was invariably proximal (thigh) and distal (below knee).\nIn CVI, IPVs are located predominately in the medial aspect of the lower extremity, more often in the middle third of the calf, followed by the lower calf and middle thigh. The prevalence of IPVs and their calf-to-thigh ratio increase linearly with the clinical severity of CVI. Both the prevalence of deep vein incompetence and the ratio of superficial and deep to superficial ([S + D]/S) increase linearly with CEAP classification. These findings support the significant relationship between deep venous reflux and PV incompetence, although the latter may exist in the absence of the former. In CEAP classes 2 to 6, reflux is invariably proximal and distal. Incompetence involving all systems (S + D + PV) increases in prevalence with the severity of CVI.",

Of this latter group, 65 patients (6.8%) required infrarenal IVC resection during tumor excision for cure. Our protocol does not include IVC reconstruction in such cases. Indications for IVC resection included tumor encasement or encroachment, postchemotherapy desmoplastic compression, or thrombus with tumor or clot in which cavotomy and thrombectomy cannot be performed.\nTwenty-four of the 65 patients (postoperative follow-up period range, 11 months to 16 years; median, 89 months) were alive and able to be examined or interviewed by written and/or phone survey to assess the long-term morbidity of their IVC resection. Based on the 1994 American Venous Forum International Consensus Committee reporting standards, the clinical classifications of these 24 patients were C0A (4), C3S (4), C4A (2), C4S (13), and C6A (1). Long-term disability was mild or absent in 75% of these patients.\nOnly 1 (4.2%) of the patients surveyed had chronic venous sequelae that would fulfill the accepted criteria for subsequent elective IVC reconstruction. Despite recent reports of IVC reconstruction demonstrating relatively good patency rates and low morbidity, the addition of such a complex, time-consuming procedure to extensive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic NSGCT involving IVC resection is generally not necessary.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that inferior vena cava filter placement should be the initial treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus (PE) in patients with coexisting malignant disease. We have chosen instead to selectively place filters only in patients with either a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy or a subsequent complication from anticoagulation therapy. The treatment efficacy and mortality rates in patients with concomitant malignant disease and venous thromboembolism using this approach was determined.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients at our institution with malignant disease in whom venous thromboembolism developed between August 1991 through August 1996 and identified 166 patients with PE (n = 8), DVT (n = 147), and DVT/PE (n = 11). Of these patients, 138 (83.1%) were initially treated with anticoagulation therapy, and 28 (16.9%) had primary filter placement because of contraindications to anticoagulation therapy (10 for intracranial tumors, 11 for recent or upcoming operations, 6 for recent hemorrhage, and 1 for a malignant bloody pericardial effusion).\nThirty-two (23%) of the 138 patients who initially underwent anticoagulation therapy subsequently required a filter for the following reasons: bleeding (n = 15, 10.9%); recurrent thromboembolism (n = 6, 4.3%); heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (n = 1, 0.7%); and perceived high risk for bleeding with continued anticoagulation therapy (n = 11, 8%). Both bleeding and recurrent thromboembolism developed in 1 patient. Sixty patients (36%) received filters. No major technical complications occurred from filter placement. Major recurrent thromboembolic complications developed in 10 patients: DVT (n = 6, 10%), PE (n = 2, 3.3%), inferior vena cava thrombosis and phlegmasia cerulea dolens (n = 1, 1.7%), superior vena cava thrombosis (n = 1, 1.7%). Venous gangrene developed in 1 patient with DVT. The 1-year actuarial survival rates for patients treated with filter and anticoagulation therapy were 35% and 38%, respectively (P = NS).\nIn summary, our experience suggests that 64% of patients with malignant disease and venous thromboembolism are effectively treated with anticoagulation alone; 17% require primary filter placement for standard indications, and an additional 19% require subsequent filter placement because of complications (primarily bleeding) or failure of anticoagulation therapy. Although technical complications of filter placement are low, serious life-threatening or limb-threatening thromboembolic complications developed in 17% of patients. Survival was poor in all patients, regardless of treatment. These data support a conservative approach of routine anticoagulation therapy with selective filter placement.",

    "abstract": "The experiments were designed to compare the effects of thrombolytic therapy (TL) and balloon-catheter thrombectomy (TX) on valvular competence, thrombogenicity, venous wall morphology, and function after acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in canine veins.\nThe femoral veins of male mongrel dogs were ligated proximally and distally for 48 hours to induce DVT. The thrombosed veins were treated with either TL (n = 5) or TX (n = 9), or no treatment was rendered (n = 6). Sham-operated dogs were used as controls. TL was performed with catheter-directed infusion of urokinase at 4000 U/min for 90 minutes. Three hours after the treatment, the valvular competence was determined with duplex scanning, thrombogenicity determined with deposition of radio-labeled platelet and fibrin, and function determined with response to contractile and relaxing agonists in organ chambers. The structural integrity of the endothelial layer was assessed by means of scanning electron microscopy.\nThe removal or lysis of the thrombus was successful in all cases. The valvular competence did not differ among the groups. The platelet deposition was the highest after TX (P <.05), and the fibrin deposition was not significantly different among the groups. In the organ chamber experiments, relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and nitric oxide were reduced after TX (P <.05). The contractions to serotonin were enhanced after TX. Scanning electron microscopy results showed a comparable (51% to 75%) endothelial loss with either treatment.\nAfter experimental acute DVT, the TL and the TX at 3 hours had similar effects on the valvular competence and the endothelial morphology. However, the TL reduced thrombogenicity, which is consistent with the preserved endothelial responses to platelet products. These data suggest that TL may preserve vein function after DVT and may reduce the long-term potential for recurrent DVT and post-thrombotic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable variability and controversy in the current management of subclavian-vein effort thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term effectiveness and the functional outcome of our preferred treatment strategy of early thrombolysis/recanalization and prompt extensive supraclavicular decompression.\nThirty-three patients who ranged in age from 15 to 60 years underwent operative decompression of 34 primary subclavian-vein thromboses, one of which was bilateral. There were 21 patients with acute thrombosis 7 of whom had had prior unsuccessful balloon venoplasty, 1 with stent placement and 8 patients with chronic/recurrent thrombosis 5 of whom had had 9 unsuccessful prior operations for attempted decompression. Four patients had high-grade symptomatic stenosis and positional occlusion. A supraclavicular approach was used in 32 cases and, in 23 cases, was complemented by an infraclavicular (n = 21) or transaxillary (n = 2) incision. Complete subclavian-vein decompression was achieved by first-rib resection (n = 31), scalenectomy (n = 33), and circumferential venolysis (n = 34).\nFollow-up was obtained in 30 patients at a mean of 31 months. Twenty of the 21 patients with acute thrombosis had a complete resolution of symptoms with a return to full activity; the other patient was lost to follow-up. Four of the 8 patients with chronic thrombosis reported a mild relief of symptoms but still had limitations of activities of daily living. All of the patients with high-grade symptomatic stenosis with positional occlusion had a complete relief of symptoms and a return to full activity.\nThe optimal management of acute effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein includes anticoagulation therapy, thrombolysis/recanalization, confirmatory positional venography, and early supraclavicular decompression of the subclavian vein. In the patients with chronic subclavian-vein thrombosis and positional venographic evidence of compression of first-rib bypass graft collaterals, the initial anticoagulation therapy should be followed by the surgical decompression of the collaterals. The supraclavicular approach alone or with an infraclavicular incision provides optimal exposure for scalenectomy, total first-rib resection, and circumferential venolysis.",

In the patients with chronic subclavian-vein thrombosis and positional venographic evidence of compression of first-rib bypass graft collaterals, the initial anticoagulation therapy should be followed by the surgical decompression of the collaterals. The supraclavicular approach alone or with an infraclavicular incision provides optimal exposure for scalenectomy, total first-rib resection, and circumferential venolysis.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of reflux in the deep and superficial venous systems in the Edinburgh population and the relationship between patterns of reflux and the presence of venous disease on clinical examination were studied.\nA cross-sectional survey was done on men and women ranging in age from 18 to 64 years, randomly selected from 12 general practices. The presence of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency was noted on clinical examination, as was the duration of venous reflux by means of duplex scanning in 8 vein segments on each leg. Results were compared using cut-off points for reflux duration (RD) of 0.5 seconds or more (RD >/= 0.5) and more than 1.0 second (RD > 1.0) to define reflux.\nThere were 1566 study participants, 867 women and 699 men. The prevalence of reflux was similar in the right and left legs. The proportion of participants with reflux was highest in the lower thigh long saphenous vein (LSV) segment (18.6% in the right leg and 17.5% in the left leg for RD >/= 0.5), followed by the above knee popliteal segments (12.3% in the right leg and 11.0% in the left leg for RD >/= 0.5), the below knee popliteal (11.3% in the right leg and 9.5% in the left leg for RD >/= 0.5), upper LSV (10.0% in the right leg and 10.8% in the left leg for RD >/= 0.5) segments, the common femoral vein segments (7.8% in the right leg and 8.0% in the left leg for RD >/= 0.5), the lower superficial femoral vein (SFV) segments (6.6% in the right leg and 6.4% in the left leg for RD >/= 0.5), and the upper SFV (5.2% in the right leg and 4.7% in the left leg for RD >/= 0.5) and short saphenous vein (SSV) (4.6% in the right leg and 5.6% in the left leg for an RD >/= 0.5) segments. In the superficial vein segments, there was little difference in the occurrence of reflux whether RD >/= 0.5 or RD > 1.0 was used; but in the different deep vein segments, the prevalence of reflux was 2 to 4 times greater for RD >/= 0.5 rather than RD > 1.0. Men had a higher prevalence of reflux in the deep vein segments than women, reaching statistical significance (P </=.01) in 4 of 5 segments for RD >/= 0.5. In general, the prevalence of reflux increased with age. Those with \"venous disease\" had a significantly higher prevalence of reflux in all vein segments than those with \"no disease\" (P </=.001).\nThe prevalence of venous reflux in the general population was related to the presence of \"venous disease,\" although it was also present in those without clinically apparent disease. There was a higher prevalence of reflux in the deep veins in men than the deep veins in women. Follow-up study of the population will determine the extent to which reflux is a predictor of future disease and complications.",

The thrombin and fibrin generation in time was studied with the measurement of the plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 (F 1+2) and of fibrinopeptide A (FPA). The plain ePTFE graft was taken as a control.\nWhen the seeded MCs were perfused with recirculating anticoagulated blood, a linear generation of F 1+2 in time was seen, with high levels of F 1+2 and FPA after 10 minutes (4.38 nmol/L and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Allopurinol was added, and the MCs generated less F 1+2 than the HAECs (0.7 nmol/L vs 1.86 nmol/L; P <.05). No fibrin formation was seen. The MVECs generated low amounts of F 1+2 (0.7 nmol/L; 10 minutes), and the HUVECs and the plain ePTFE graft generated the lowest amounts of F 1+2 (0.26 and 0.25 nmol/L, respectively). When the MCs were perfused with non-anticoagulated blood, high amounts of thrombin and fibrin were generated immediately and constantly and could not be decreased with allopurinol. The perfusion of the plain ePTFE graft showed a dramatic increase in F 1+2 and FPA levels towards the end of the experiments. The seeded HAECs, HUVECs, and MVECs inhibited this increase. These results were confirmed by means of scanning electron microscopy.\nVascular prostheses that are seeded with cultured MCs are highly procoagulant. Standard ePTFE graft prostheses also initiate coagulation, which supports the idea of cell seeding. The endothelial cells, of which the MVECs are the most readily available, seem to preserve their anticoagulant properties after being seeded on vascular grafts.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) likely contribute to the degradation of medial elastin in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), and tetracycline antibiotics exhibit MMP-inhibiting properties. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of doxycycline and several non-antibiotic chemically modified tetracyclines (CMTs) in a rat model of elastase-induced AAA.\nFifty-two male Wistar rats underwent intraluminal perfusion of the abdominal aorta with porcine pancreatic elastase. The rats then were treated for 7 days with subcutaneous injections of saline solution, different doses of doxycycline, or 1 of 4 different CMTs. The aortic diameters were measured with microcalipers, and the fixed tissues were examined by means of light microscopy. Gelatin zymography was used to assess the MMP activity in the aortic tissue extracts.\nThe mean aortic diameter in the control group increased by 126% +/- 14% on day 7 (from 1.57 +/- 0.04 mm to 3.54 +/- 0.27 mm; P <.05), and 5 of 6 animals (83%) had AAAs. Doxycycline appeared to inhibit aortic dilatation in a dose-dependent manner, and AAAs did not develop in any animals. Half-maximal effects were observed at a dose of approximately 6 mg/kg/day, and maximal effects were noted at greater than 30 mg/kg/day. No AAAs were observed in the animals that were treated with CMTs at 15 mg/kg/day. Each of the following CMTs exhibited an efficacy that was similar to that of doxycycline (percent inhibition of aortic dilatation vs control; all P <.05): CMT-3 (47.6%), CMT-4 (38.9%), CMT-7 (47.6%), CMT-8 (54.0%), and doxycycline (51.6%). Tissues from saline solution-treated controls exhibited a transmural inflammatory response and marked destruction of the medial elastic lamellae. Tetracycline derivatives limited the disruption of medial elastin without appearing to alter either the inflammatory response or the rat aortic wall production of metallogelatinases.\nTetracycline derivatives suppress the development of AAAs after elastase-induced aortic injury in the rat. The aneurysm-suppressing effects of doxycycline appear to be dose-dependent and distinct from its antibiotic activities, and they coincide with the structural preservation of medial elastin fibers. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of MMP-inhibiting tetracyclines as a novel pharmacologic strategy for the suppression of aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) was designed to measure community walking ability in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication. We compared the WIQ scores to objective measures of walking in a heterogeneous group of patients with and without PAD.\nThe study was designed as a cross-sectional study, with the setting in an academic medical center. The subjects were patients with PAD (n = 145) who were identified from a noninvasive vascular laboratory at an academic medical center. The patients without PAD (n = 65) were identified from a general medicine practice. The average number of comorbidities was 2.03 for patients with PAD and 1.52 for patients without PAD. Among the patients with PAD, 28% had classical intermittent claudication symptoms and 55% had exertional leg symptoms other than claudication. The main outcome measures were the WIQ estimates of the patient-reported walking distance and walking speed on a scale of 0 to 100. Walking endurance was measured objectively with the 6-minute walk. Walking velocity was measured with a 4-m walk. PAD and PAD severity were defined with the ankle brachial index.\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rho) between the WIQ distance score and the 6-minute walk score were 0.557 among patients with PAD (P <.001) and 0.484 among patients without PAD (P <.001). The correlation coefficients between the WIQ speed score and the usual-paced 4-m walk score were 0.528 among patients with PAD (P <.001) and 0.524 among patients without PAD (P <.001). The correlations were not affected by the presence versus the absence of intermittent claudication, by PAD severity, or by the presence of 2 or more versus less than 2 comorbid illnesses. The WIQ scores in the highest and lowest quartiles were the most closely associated with the objective measures of function.\nThe WIQ is a valid measure of community walking ability in a heterogeneous group of patients with and without PAD. The WIQ discriminates best among patients in the highest and the lowest quartiles of walking speed and endurance.",

    "abstract": "Results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in selected cases have been reported to be equal or superior to those of arterial bypass graft surgery, with a lower morbidity and mortality. We performed PTA of stenotic or occlusive lesions in patients with limb-threatening ischemia, hoping to improve our overall success and decrease morbidity in this group of patients. The results of PTA in the limb-salvage setting was evaluated.\nFrom 1992 to 1995, 307 PTAs were performed in 257 patients. One hundred sixty-one (63%) patients had diabetes mellitus, and 32 (12%) patients had renal failure. All patients were evaluated by means of pulse volume recordings and ankle brachial indices at 1 and 6 weeks after PTA and at 3 month intervals thereafter. Seventeen patients (9%) were lost to follow-up. The continued success or failure of PTA was defined by means of noninvasive vascular laboratory criteria, patency by means of pulse examination, the need for subsequent bypass grafting across the index lesion, and limb salvage.\nThe 1-year patency rates for external iliac PTAs (56%) were significantly lower (P <.05) than those for common iliac PTAs (87%). Infrainguinal PTAs at the femoral, popliteal, and tibial level had 1-year patency rates of less than 15%.\nCommon iliac artery PTA is justified in most cases in which it is feasible. However, when PTAs are performed below the inguinal ligament, the results are markedly worse. One-year patency rates of PTA in this group of patients with threatened limbs are inferior to the patency rates of arterial bypass grafts, even when these bypasses are performed with a prosthetic material. PTA should not be considered as a primary treatment modality for patients with infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease who also have limb-threatening ischemia, except in unusual circumstances.",

The preprocedural and postprocedural clinical records, arteriograms, and noninvasive vascular laboratory examinations of 83 patients (41 men [49.4%] and 42 women [50.6%]; mean age at intervention, 63 years) in whom endovascular repair of the subclavian (66, 75.9%), left common carotid (14, 16.1%), and innominate (7, 8.0%) arteries was attempted were retrospectively reviewed.\nInitial technical success was achieved in 82 of 87 procedures (94.3%). The inability to cross 4 complete subclavian occlusions and the iatrogenic dissection of 1 common carotid artery lesion accounted for the 5 initial failures. Complications occurred in 17.8% of 73 subclavian and innominate procedures, including access-site bleeding in 6 and distal embolization in 2. Ischemic strokes occurred in 2 of 14 common carotid interventions (14.3%), both of which were performed in conjunction with ipsilateral carotid bifurcation endarterectomy. The 30-day mortality rate was 4.8% for the entire group. By means of life-table analysis, 84% of the subclavian and innominate interventions, including initial failures, remain patent by objective means at 35 months. No patients have required reintervention or surgical conversion for recurrence of symptoms. Of the 11 patients available for follow-up study who underwent common carotid interventions, 10 remain stroke-free at a mean of 14.3 months.\nAngioplasty and primary stenting of the subclavian and innominate arteries can be performed with relative safety and expectations of satisfactory midterm success. Endovascular repair of common carotid artery lesions can be performed with a high degree of technical success, but should be approached with caution when performed in conjunction with ipsilateral bifurcation endarterectomy.",

Complications occurred in 17.8% of 73 subclavian and innominate procedures, including access-site bleeding in 6 and distal embolization in 2. Ischemic strokes occurred in 2 of 14 common carotid interventions (14.3%), both of which were performed in conjunction with ipsilateral carotid bifurcation endarterectomy. The 30-day mortality rate was 4.8% for the entire group. By means of life-table analysis, 84% of the subclavian and innominate interventions, including initial failures, remain patent by objective means at 35 months. No patients have required reintervention or surgical conversion for recurrence of symptoms. Of the 11 patients available for follow-up study who underwent common carotid interventions, 10 remain stroke-free at a mean of 14.3 months.",

The generalizability of these studies to average surgical practice remains an important public health concern.\nThe objective of the study was to determine the predictors of outcome after carotid endarterectomy on a regional basis.\nThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study and included all consecutive patients presented for carotid endarterectomy at the 8 University of Toronto-affiliated hospitals in the period from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 1996. The main outcome measure was 30-day postoperative stroke or death rate.\nDuring the study interval, 1280 primary carotid endarterectomies were performed. The overall combined stroke and death rate was 6.3% for all patients who underwent endarterectomy (4.0% for patients who were asymptomatic). The significant predictors of poor outcome were the following: presenting symptoms (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96, 3.12), low surgeon volume (<6 cases per year; odds ratio, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.65, 9.58), and left-sided surgery (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.07, 2.76).\nThese data suggest that adoption of the recommendations of the symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trials is appropriate. However, endarterectomy for asymptomatic lesions remains of uncertain benefit on a regional basis and must be individualized to the experience of the specific surgeon.

Twelve patients with venous reflux (9 patients in clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathologic classification 4; 3 patients in classification 5) with an average venous filling index of 5.45 mL/s and 4 patients without venous reflux were enrolled in the study. The growth rates, the response to basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), and the senescence markers (beta-galactosidase activity at a pH level of 6, unstimulated fibroblasts fibronectin protein, and messenger RNA levels) were determined for each cell population.\nThe number of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase positive cells (8.3% +/- 1.9% vs 2.2% +/- 0.8%; P =.008) and the level of cellular fibronectin protein (455.7 +/- 80 vs 210 +/- 51; P =.04) and messenger RNA (16.8 +/- 6.8 vs 13.5 +/- 5.7; P =.042) were significantly higher in the distal fibroblasts as compared with the proximal fibroblast cultures. The growth rates of the distal fibroblasts were lower when compared with the proximal fibroblasts (15,746 +/- 4287 cells/day vs 29,550 +/- 5035 cells/day; P <.002) but were not different in the presence of b-FGF (41,717 +/- 9542 cells/day vs 47,030 +/- 6133 cells/day; P =.53). In the patients without venous reflux, no site differences were noted in the growth rates or the senescence markers between the proximal and distal fibroblasts.\nDistal fibroblasts that are isolated from patients with venous reflux display more senescence characteristics than do proximal fibroblasts and have significantly lower growth rates. Despite senescence, b-FGF restored the distal-fibroblasts growth rate to that of the stimulated proximal fibroblasts, which proposes a therapeutic role for b-FGF.

We have previously described the mitogenic effect of insulin on VSMCs in vitro; the effects of insulin and glucose separately and in combination on the proliferation of VSMCs grown in serum-free media were studied.\nHuman infragenicular VSMCs isolated from diabetic patients with end-stage peripheral vascular disease undergoing below-knee amputation were used.

We previously have shown that patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and occult diabetes have abnormal BAVA results when fasting and after oral glucose intake during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Troglitazone is an oral hypoglycemic agent that enhances the action of insulin. The effect of troglitazone on BAVA in patients with occult diabetes and PVD is not known.\nPatients with PVD, normal fasting glucose levels, and abnormal OGTT results were identified. With a duplex ultrasound scan, BAVA was evaluated by measuring the brachial artery (BA) flow (in millimeters per minute) before and after 5 minutes of BA occlusion during fasting and at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after the administration of 75 g of glucose during OGTT. Troglitazone therapy (400 mg/day) was begun, and the BAVA evaluation was repeated after 2 and 4 months. These results were compared with the results of the control group who had normal fasting glucose levels, normal OGTT results, and no evidence of PVD. A paired t test was used to compare the BA flow before and after BA occlusion, with a P value of less than.05 considered significant.\nThe control group had a normal hyperemic response with a significantly increased BA flow after 5 minutes of BA occlusion during fasting and at all stages of the OGTT. The occult diabetic group had an abnormal response to hyperemia before the treatment with troglitazone and showed little change in flow after BA occlusion. After 2 months of troglitazone therapy, BAVA results improved after oral glucose intake but not during fasting. After 4 months, BAVA results normalized both while fasting and after oral glucose intake during the OGTT.\nPatients with occult diabetes and PVD have impaired BAVA, which normalizes after treatment with troglitazone. Insulin-action enhancers may slow the progression of PVD in patients with diabetes by improving endothelial cell function. Agents that are aimed at enhancing the action of insulin may have an advantage over the other traditional therapies for diabetes.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the accuracy of intraoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for the detection of cerebral ischemia by comparing EEG with simultaneous mental status evaluation (MSE) during carotid endarterectomy in awake patients.\nBetween 1994 and 1997, 208 consecutive carotid endarterectomies were prospectively evaluated for cerebral function during surgery with simultaneous MSE and EEG monitoring. Regional anesthesia (RA), which consisted of superficial cervical block, was chosen preferentially in 75% of the cases, with general anesthesia (GA) reserved for the patients who did not fulfill the criteria for RA. When available, 8-channel EEG monitoring was performed (59% with RA and 55% with GA).\nThe EEG was a reliable predictor in comparison with MSE in most but not all cases of cerebral ischemia. Significant neurologic changes were noted using MSE in 4 of 89 patients (4.5%) that were not detected using EEG (false negative results). Conversely, 6 of 89 cases (6.7%) showed unilateral slowing without associated changes in MSE (false positive results). For the awake patients, 21 of 150 cases (14%) showed MSE changes that required a shunt. By contrast, 9 of 32 GA cases (28%) showed EEG changes that would have led to shunting (P = NS). In the RA group, there were no strokes versus 3 of 58 cases (5.2%) with strokes in the GA group. Two of 150 cases (0.1%) had transient ischemic attacks in the RA group. There was 1 myocardial infarction in the GA group; no deaths occurred in this series.\nEEG monitoring yielded a significant number of false positive (6.7%) and false negative (4.5%) results in the detection of neurologic deficits when compared with MSE in the awake patients.

    "abstract": "The traditional separation of vascular surgery and interventional radiology into distinct units is associated with inefficiencies in patient care, practice management, and training. Traditional departmental politics, discrepant clinical backgrounds and philosophies, fear of decreasing remuneration, and basic differences in education, training, and practice have all rendered mergers difficult.\nWe have implemented a model that incorporates all the clinical, fiscal, and educational activities of the 2 former entities into a single unit. A 5-physician vascular surgery group, its noninvasive laboratory, and a 3-physician interventional radiology group were unified. The revenue was deposited into a single account from which all the expenses were paid. The net income of the joint unit was apportioned on a predetermined pro rata basis, with scaled percentages for each practitioner. In an effort to separate clinical decision making from economic pressures, the individual physician remuneration was not on the basis of productivity. Clinical volume, gross revenue, and remuneration were compared with the 12-month period that immediately preceded the merger and contrasted to the previous 3-year historical trend (HT).\nThe number of vascular surgical procedures fell after the merger (-9.3%; HT, +4.7%). By contrast, the number of interventional radiology procedures rose (+56.1%; HT, +15.2%), as did the number of noninvasive testing (+9.2%; HT, +3.5%). In concordance with the number of procedures, the gross revenue of vascular surgery fell (-23.7%; HT, +1.1%) and that of interventional radiology rose (+53.5%; HT, +46.0%). The increased efficiencies allowed the total expenses of the 2 units to fall (-13.2%; HT, +7. 5%), and, despite the reduced revenue, the vascular surgeon remuneration was preserved (+0.7%; HT, -3.9%) and the radiology remuneration rose (+22.3%; HT, +8.3%). The merger allowed the vascular surgery fellows to actively participate in 26 interventional cases per month and the interventional radiology fellows to actively participate in 8 open surgical cases per month.\nThe merger of vascular surgery and interventional radiology resulted in a decrease in the surgical procedures and revenue, with a corresponding increase in the interventional radiology procedures and revenue. Despite these effects, the physician remuneration increased as a result of the improved efficiencies in practice management and the reduction in expenses. The merger of the 2 units excludes the economic pressures from clinical decision making and appears to be warranted on the basis of the fiscal and educational benefits that are achieved.",

    "abstract": "Conventional pre-endovascular procedural evaluation uses both noninvasive testing and diagnostic arteriography. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures often must be performed separately because of concerns about excessive contrast administration or inappropriate location of vascular access for the interventional procedure. We wanted to determine if patients could successfully undergo endovascular procedures based on noninvasive modalities alone.\nOne hundred nineteen consecutive patients requiring intervention for lower-extremity ischemia were evaluated by means of physical examinations and segmental pressure measurements. Patients then underwent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to image native vessels or duplex scanning for failing bypass grafts. Suitable patients underwent endovascular procedures with \"road map\" arteriography, which was compared with preoperative duplex scanning or MRA findings. Costs of the conventional and noninvasive approaches were compared, on the basis of estimated hospital cost schedule.\nSixty consecutive endovascular procedures were performed in 56 patients (105 lesions angioplastied), either alone (30, 50%) or in combination (30, 50%) with another vascular reconstruction. Completely noninvasive evaluation was accomplished in 43 procedures (72%), either by means of duplex scanning (11, 18%) or MRA (32, 53%). Conventional arteriography (CA) was required in 2 patients (3%) because of MRA contraindications and in 1 patient because of complex previous arterial reconstruction. Fourteen patients had earlier CAs. The findings of the noninvasive modalities were confirmed in every case by means of intraoperative arteriography, and no additional lesions were revealed (no false positive or negative studies). After endovascular interventions, the mean patient ankle-brachial index (ABI) improved from 0.64 +/- 0.03 to 0.81 +/- 0.03 (P <.001) and the mean limb-status category improved from 3.4 +/- 0.2 to 0.8 +/- 0.2 (P <.001). There were 4 initial technical failures (7%), 1 morbidity (1%), and no mortalities. The noninvasive approach was less costly than if preprocedural diagnostic CA had been used, allowing $551 saved for each duplex scanning case and $235 saved for each MRA case. If the cost of a short-stay unit after a diagnostic arteriogram was included, the savings were greater: $695 saved for each duplex scanning case and $379 saved for each MRA case.\nEndovascular procedures can be performed based on preprocedural noninvasive modalities alone. For patients requiring endovascular procedures, knowledge of the arterial anatomy before obtaining arterial access avoids the need for additional punctures or sessions (eg, antegrade puncture for femoral angioplasty after retrograde puncture for the diagnostic arteriogram). This approach is less costly than performing preprocedural diagnostic arteriography and avoids the hazards of arterial puncture and nephrotoxic contrast agents.",

    "abstract": "Mild hypothermia has been suggested to be protective against tissue ischemia during aortic operations. However, recent studies have documented detrimental cardiac effects of hypothermia during a variety of operative procedures. The influence of different warming methods and the impact of hypothermia during standard aortic procedures was assessed.\nOne hundred patients who underwent repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms or aortoiliac occlusive disease were prospectively randomized into 2 groups, receiving either a circulating water mattress or a forced air warming blanket. Adjuvant warming methods were standardized. The day before surgery, 48-hour Holter monitors were applied and interpreted by a cardiologist blinded to the treatment. Randomization resulted in equivalent groups with regard to patient history, indications for surgery, body mass index, length of surgery, and fluid requirements.\nCore temperatures were significantly warmer during surgery (36.3 degrees C +/- 0.7 degrees C vs 35.4 +/- 0.8 degrees C) and after surgery (36.4 degrees C +/- 0.7 degrees C vs 35.6 degrees C +/- 0.9 degrees C) in patients with forced air warming (P <.001). The circulating water mattress group had significantly more metabolic acidosis perioperatively (P =.03). Postoperative length of stay, cardiac complications, and death rates were not significantly different. Subgroup analysis of 83 aneurysm patients comparing normothermia with hypothermia (temperature less than 36 degrees C) on arrival to the recovery room identified decreased cardiac output (P =.02), thrombocytopenia (P =.02), elevated prothrombin time (P =.04), and inferior Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores (P <.001) in the hypothermic group. Holter analysis revealed more sinus tachycardia (ST) segment changes and ventricular tachycardia in hypothermic aneurysm patients (P =.05).\nPatients treated with forced air blankets had significantly less metabolic acidosis and were kept significantly warmer than those treated with circulating water mattresses. Patients with aneurysms that were kept normothermic had a significantly improved clinical profile, with fewer cardiac events on the Holter recordings. We therefore conclude that (1) normothermia is protective for infrarenal aortic surgical patients; and (2) forced air warming blankets provide improved temperature maintenance compared with circulating water mattresses.",

    "abstract": "Limb-threatening ischemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) represents a challenging clinical problem. Multiple series have shown the inferior limb salvage rate for femoropopliteal or femorotibial bypass grafts in this group. This outcome study is restricted to those patients with ESRD who require pedal bypass grafts for attempted limb salvage.\nBetween December 1, 1990, and December 31, 1997, 34 patients with ESRD underwent pedal bypass grafting on 41 limbs. This review explores the patient and bypass graft outcomes and their relationships to typical risk factors.\nThe average age in the study was 64 years (range, 39 to 85 years). Twenty patients (59%) were men, 31 (91%) had diabetes, 32 (94%) were hypertensive, and 28 (82%) had coronary artery disease, but only 10 patients (29%) were smokers. All the patients were undergoing dialysis except 2 patients with functioning renal transplants. All bypass grafting procedures were performed for limb salvage. The follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 84 months (average, 13.5 months). With life-table analysis, the cumulative assisted primary patency rate was 62% at 1 year and 62% at 2 years. The limb salvage rate was 56% and 50% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. All the patients who were seen with heel gangrene had early limb loss or died. Seven of the 16 amputations (44%) were performed despite patent bypass grafts. Ten of the 16 amputations (63%) occurred within 3 months of the surgery. The survival rate was 64% at 1 year and 52% at 2 years. After the bypass graft procedure, the mean ankle brachial index and the toe pressure rose from 0.48 to 1.05 and 18 to 86, respectively.\nModest success can be expected with pedal bypass grafts in patients with ESRD, with most failures occurring in the first 3 months. Limb salvage rates lag behind graft patency rates because of progressive necrosis despite a hemodynamically functioning bypass graft. Heel gangrene is a strong predictor for a negative outcome. Lastly, overall patient survival rates are poor but comparable with the rates of other patients with ESRD.",

    "abstract": "Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), or Buerger's disease, a distinct form of vascular occlusive disease that afflicts the peripheral arteries of young smokers, is often characterized by an inexorable downhill course even in patients who discontinue smoking once a stage of critical limb ischemia associated with ulceration or gangrene is reached. As part of a phase I clinical trial to document the safety and efficacy of intramuscular gene transfer of naked plasmid DNA-encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (phVEGF165) in the treatment of critical limb ischemia, we treated TAO in 6 patients.\nSeven limbs in 6 patients (3 men, 3 women; mean age, 33 years; range, 33 to 51 years) who satisfied the criteria for TAO and had signs or symptoms of critical limb ischemia were treated twice, 4 weeks apart, with 2 or 4 mg of phVEGF165, which was administered by direct intramuscular injection at 4 arbitrarily selected sites in the ischemic limb. The gene expression was documented by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that was performed on peripheral blood samples.\nThe ulcers that were nonhealing for more than 1 month healed completely in 3 of 5 limbs after the intramuscular phVEGF165 gene therapy. Nocturnal rest pain was relieved in the remaining 2 patients, although both continue to have claudication. The evidence of the improved perfusion to the distal ischemic limb included an increase of more than 0.1 in the ankle brachial index in 3 limbs, an improved flow shown with magnetic resonance imaging in 7 of the 7 limbs, and newly visible collateral vessels shown with serial contrast angiography in 7 of the 7 limbs. The adverse consequences of the phVEGF165 gene transfer were limited to transient ankle or calf edema in 3 of the 7 limbs. Two patients with advanced distal forefoot gangrene ultimately required below-knee amputation despite the evidence of improved perfusion. A histologic section disclosed the classic pathologic findings of TAO.\nTherapeutic angiogenesis with phVEGF165 gene transfer, if instituted before the development of forefoot gangrene, may provide a novel therapy for patients with advanced Buerger's disease that is unresponsive to standard medical or surgical treatment methods.",
