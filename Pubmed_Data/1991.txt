    "abstract": "The pedigrees were constructed of 43 patients (probands) who underwent resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Seven probands (16.2%) had a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) known to have had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (multiplex family). To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm, ultrasound screening of first-degree relatives over age 40 years was undertaken. Of 202 eligible relatives, 103 (51.0%) were screened. An occult abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3.0 cm or an infrarenal/suprarenal aortic diameter ratio of greater than 1.5. An incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as a clear focal bulge of the infrarenal aorta, which was less than 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Four of 103 relatives (3.9%) were found to have an occult abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 57M, 60M, 62F, 65M), and three (2.9%) were found with an incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 56M, 60M, 67F). These smaller abdominal aortic aneurysms were in patients younger than the operated probands (average age men, 67 years; women, 69 years). Six of seven individuals were in families previously considered simplex, increasing the actual multiplex family frequency from 16.2% to 27.9%. All seven new abdominal aortic aneurysms were found in the 49 siblings age 55 years or older. There were no abdominal aortic aneurysms found in the 39 relatives under age 55 years, in 14 children ages 50 to 59 years or in one parent. Therefore of the siblings age 55 years or older, 5/20 men (25.0%) and 2/29 women (6.9%) were found to have a previously undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We examined flow velocities in the superior mesenteric artery and celiac artery in normal controls (group C, n = 11), diabetic patients (group D, n = 8), and diabetic patients with clinically evident autonomic neuropathy (group DN, n = 6) to further define the usefulness of duplex examination in the evaluation of the mesenteric circulation in normal and disease states. By use of a 3 MHz duplex scanner, peak systolic velocity, peak diastolic forward velocity, end-diastolic forward velocity, and peak diastolic reverse velocity were measured in centimeters per second before and after a standardized meal. The vessels' diameters in centimeters were also measured. After the meal peak diastolic reverse velocity disappeared in all patients. The average vessel diameter in the superior mesenteric artery (0.7 cm) and celiac artery (0.8 cm) did not change. Flow velocities in the celiac artery were not significantly altered by the meal. In the control group, peak systolic velocity in the superior mesenteric artery increased 38%, peak diastolic forward velocity rose 66%, and end-diastolic forward velocity increased by 70%. In the diabetic nonneuropathic group the changes were 15%, 98%, and 100%, respectively. These changes were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, the patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy presenting a picture of gastroparesis did not exhibit the expected increases in postprandial velocities. Moreover, this alteration in blood flow velocity, although similar to that encountered in patients with intestinal angina, did not appear to be due to occlusive arterial disease on the basis of clinical examination and B-mode scanning.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that measurements of cavernous arterial diastolic velocity and resistance index could provide a quantitative but noninvasive measure of penile corporal venous leakage. Seventy-four men were studied with duplex ultrasonography after intracavernosal injection of 60 mg of papaverine. Fourteen men had normal erection and served as controls. Sixty men had a 1-year history of transient fading or incomplete erections. In all subjects the peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity were measured, and the resistance index was calculated (peak systolic velocity--end-diastolic velocity/peak systolic velocity). Men with normal erections had peak systolic velocities greater than 35 cm/sec and end-diastolic velocities less than 4.5 cm/sec (group 1). Patients with incomplete erections (group II) could be classified into three subgroups. Twenty-three patients with end-diastolic velocities greater than 4.5 cm/sec and normal peak systolic velocities greater than 35 cm/sec were suspected to have corporal venous leakage (group A). Eighteen patients had normal end-diastolic velocities less than 4.5 cm/sec. Twelve of this group had peak systolic velocities less than 35 cm/sec, and six had peak systolic velocities ranging from 37 to 44 cm/sec. These patients were suspected of having arterial insufficiency (group B). Fifteen patients with end-diastolic velocities greater than 4.5 cm and peak systolic velocities less than 35 cm were suspected of having both venous leakage and arterial insufficiency (group C). Twenty-one patients with abnormal diastolic flow underwent infusion pharmacocavernosometry to determine the saline maintenance infusion rate necessary to maintain an intracavernosal pressure of 90 to 100 mm Hg or a full erectile response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Thirty-one arterial macroaneurysms in 23 pediatric-aged patients (16 boys and 7 girls) were treated at the University of Michigan. The average age at time of diagnosis was 10.2 years (range 6 months to 18 years). Vessels involved the aorta (4), as well as hepatic (1), splenic (2), gastroepiploic (1), renal (12), iliac (1), superficial femoral (4), popliteal (1), brachial (1), radial (2), and ulnar (2) arteries. Twelve children exhibited overt clinical manifestations including presence of a mass (7), local pain (3), hematemesis (1), and painless obstructive jaundice (1). Eleven children had asymptomatic lesions. Aneurysm existence was confirmed by arteriography or operation. All but one child underwent surgical therapy, with 20 long-term survivors (mean follow-up 3.5 years). One operative death occurred and one death occurred 6 years after surgery. This experience and a review of previously reported cases served as a basis for categorization of childhood aneurysmal disease as true aneurysms associated with (I) arterial infection, (II) giant-cell aortoarteritis, (III) autoimmune connective tissue disease, (IV) Kawasaki's disease, (V) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan's syndrome, (VI) other forms of noninflammatory medial degeneration, (VII) arterial dysplasias, (VIII) congenital-idiopathic factors, as well as (IX) false aneurysms associated with extravascular events causing vessel wall injury or disruption. Knowledge of the varied clinicopathologic characteristics of arterial aneurysms in children is important in treating these patients.",

    "abstract": "This article is concerned with the study of the effect of several variables, principally that of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, on the incidence of neurologic deficit in a prospective randomized series of patients with extensive aneurysms of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (thoracoabdominal type I and II). Forty-six patients had cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and 52 were controls, with a total of 98 available for study. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was continuously monitored in the former group and pressure maintained less than or equal to 10 mm Hg in 20, less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in 20, and greater than 15 mm Hg in 6 patients during period of aortic clamping. The method of treatment including reattachment of intercostal and lumbar arteries (p = 0.2), temporary atriofemoral bypass during aortic occlusion (p = 0.3), and spinal fluid drainage (p = 0.8) were not statistically significant in reducing the incidence of neurologic deficits. Thus cerebrospinal fluid drainage as we used it, was not beneficial in preventing paraplegia. On appropriate statistical analysis we found that the only significant predictor of delayed deficits was postoperative hypotension (p = 0.006).",

    "abstract": "Forty-seven patients underwent selective catheterization of middle and lower thoracic intercostal and upper lumbar arteries to define the origin of the artery of Adamkiewicz. One patient had significant atheroembolism, and a second had transient lower extremity paresthesias. No other complications occurred. The origin was found in 26 (55%), and 21 patients underwent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with this knowledge. When the critical lumbar or intercostal artery could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients survived, and one was paralyzed. However, if the aneurysm repair mandated a midgraft anastomosis to intercostal arteries critical to spinal cord perfusion, seven of nine patients either died or were paralyzed (p less than 0.05). In the group of 19 patients operated on in whom spinal cord blood supply was not identified three patients had a technically unsuccessful operation; two died, and one was paralyzed. Twelve of 16 patients who had an adequate, but unsuccessful attempt at localization were treated by intercostal \"neglect\" and survived. Late paresis developed in two patients, but they are walking now. One of the patients who died had multiple systems failure and awakened paraplegic. She had a patent, enlarged, thoracic radicular artery at T-5 which probably supplied to spinal cord and which was missed angiographically. Paralysis was associated with aneurysm extent (group 2 and III B, dissections vs group 1 & 3, p less than 0.05). Selective intercostal angiography requires further refinement, but it is safe and offers the promise of understanding the mechanisms and risks of spinal cord complications after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Kinking and compression with knee flexion are thought to be one cause of failure of below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypass. To prevent this problem polytetrafluoroethylene grafts externally supported with rigid rings have been developed. The present randomized, prospective study compared ringed and nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in 122 patients who underwent femoropopliteal bypass for severe limb ischemia. Patients were well matched for surgical indications and risk factors. There was no significant difference in the 3-year graft patency rate of ringed versus nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (74% vs 68%, p = 0.5). Similarly, no significant differences were found in the 3-year graft patency rates of ringed versus non-ringed above-knee (82% vs 74%, p = 0.5) or below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (68% vs 59%, p = 0.5). The 3-year graft patency rate of all above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses was slightly greater than that of below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (76% vs 62%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). The 3-year limb salvage rate with ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was 92% compared with 79% for nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Data to date from this study fail to support the recommendation that ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts be used preferentially over conventional polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients who require femoropopliteal bypass with a synthetic graft.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the influence of antiplatelet drugs on patency in femoropopliteal vein bypasses, 48 vascular surgeons recruited 549 patients to a randomized double-blind trial of aspirin (300 mg) + dipyridamole (150 mg) or placebo twice daily starting 2 days before surgery and continuing indefinitely. Graft occlusion measured objectively by independent coordinators and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke) were studied, expressed by life table, and analyzed statistically by log rank and confidence intervals (95% CI). Randomization achieved comparable groups with 60% of grafts inserted for rest pain or gangrene. Operative complications on aspirin plus dipyridamole included 18 reoperations for bleeding and 12 hematomas compared with 9 and 14, respectively, on placebo (NS). Most of the 172 graft failures occurred early with failure rates of 43/1000 patient-months in the first 3 months, reducing to 17/1000 at 6 to 12 months, and under 10/1000 in subsequent years. Cumulative graft patency on placebo was 72%, 62%, and 60% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, compared with 78%, 70%, and 61% on aspirin plus dipyridamole. The difference in patency of 6.1% (95% CI, -3% to 15.5%) at 1 year and 8.0% (95% CI, -5% to 21%) at 2 years failed to achieve significance (p = 0.43). On mean follow-up of 34 months, 53 (132/1000 patient-years) cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident) occurred in patients on placebo compared with only 35 (73/1000) on aspirin plus dipyridamole, a significant difference of 59/1000 (p = 0.004). Antiplatelet therapy had little influence on femoropopliteal vein patency, but subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke was reduced in these patients with peripheral vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm is conventionally treated by aneurysmorrhaphy with inlying graft. Alternatively, division of the aorta, with suture closure of the distal aorta and outflow vessels (exclusion of the aneurysm), and end-to-end proximal to distal bypass may be performed. However, the long-term fate of this operation has not been determined. Specifically, concern exists that the excluded blood filled aneurysm may not thrombose or may be the source of late sepsis. During an 8-year period we have treated 280 abdominal aortic aneurysms (urgent and elective) by exclusion of the abdominal aortic aneurysm sac and bypass via the posterolateral retroperitoneal approach. Mean age was 70 years (range, 44 to 88), with 217 men and 63 women. Preoperative CT scanning and aortography were performed to assess arterial anatomy. Seventy tube grafts and 260 bifurcation grafts were used. Thirty-day mortality rate was 4%. Estimated blood loss was 731 +/- 52 ml; mean transfusion requirements were 456 +/- 82 ml. The minor complication rate was 6%, and it is of great interest that there were no cases of ischemic colitis requiring colectomy. Aneurysm sacs thrombosed except in two anticoagulated patients who required further treatment. No late infections occurred. Five-year bypass patency rate was 98%. These data demonstrate that this method of treatment effectively minimized operative dissection and blood loss and therefore is a viable alternative for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "From 1981 to 1989, 361 consecutive in situ saphenous vein bypasses were performed. Indications for revascularization were critical limb ischemia (n = 335, 93%), popliteal aneurysm (n = 15, 4%), and claudication (n = 11, 3%). Outflow tract was the popliteal artery in 116 (32%) and tibial artery in 245 (68%) of bypasses. At 6 years primary patency was 63% and secondary patency was 81%. During the performance of the in situ bypass procedure, 86 (24%) venous conduits were modified because of a technical failure (n = 49, 13%) or an inadequate vein segment (n = 37, 10%). Secondary patency at 4 years for bypasses requiring modification was 72% compared to 84% for bypasses not modified (p less than 0.05). Atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery necessitating endarterectomy, patch angioplasty, or replacement lowered primary patency at 3 years (69%) compared to the inflow artery not requiring reconstruction (46%, p less than 0.02). In the follow-up period, 95 (26%) bypasses were revised because of thrombosis or hemodynamic failure. Bypasses requiring revision had a 4-year secondary patency of 68% compared to 88% for bypasses not revised (p less than 0.02). The first 179 cases (1981 to 1985) were compared to the subsequent 182 cases (1986 to 1989). The secondary patency at 3 years for the latter half (92%) compared to the first half (80%) of the experience was significantly improved (p less than 0.02). The secondary patency for bypasses not requiring revision was significantly improved (p less than 0.02) for the latter half (n = 142, 97%) compared to the first half (n = 124, 83%) of the series. Long-term patency with the in situ saphenous vein bypass is dependent on surgical experience, quality of the venous conduit, and atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery that necessitates reconstruction. Meticulous surgical technique and compulsive bypass surveillance results in superior long-term patency.",

Mean plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients than in controls (14.37 +/- 6.89 nmol/ml vs 10.10 +/- 2.16, p less than 0.05). Thirty-nine percent of patients (83 of 214) had plasma homocyst(e)ine values greater than control mean + 2 standard deviations. Plasma homocyst(e)ine values were contrasted to age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, renal failure, and plasma cholesterol. No difference was found in the incidence and/or level of any of these risk factors when patients with normal plasma homocyst(e)ine were compared to those with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, both by univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine were more likely to demonstrate clinical progression of lower extremity disease and of coronary artery disease, but not of cerebral vascular disease than were patients with normal plasma homocyst(e)ine, and the rate of progression was more rapid (p = 0.002). Progression of lower extremity disease as assessed in the vascular laboratory was also more common in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine (p = 0.01). We conclude that elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine is an independent risk factor for symptomatic lower extremity disease or cerebral vascular disease or both. Symptomatic patients with lower extremity disease and with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine also appear to have more rapid progression of disease.",

Reoperation was prompted by recurrent symptoms in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. Comparison of long-term stroke prevention in those patients who did (84% at 5 years, 78.6% at 10 years) and did not (90.3% at 5 years, 83.6% at 10 years) develop recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation revealed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.48) when measured from the time of primary operation. The perioperative stroke and death rates for reoperation (3.4% and 0%) were acceptable. We conclude that with our acceptably low perioperative stroke morbidity (3.4%), surgery for recurrent carotid stenosis in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis maintains the durable stroke prevention offered by primary carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Over a 5-year period 642 patients underwent 686 carotid endarterectomies with patch closure and intraoperative surveillance with continuous-wave Doppler. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5%. Patients were screened with duplex scans immediately after operation for the presence of residual carotid lesions, and followed every 3 to 6 months for either the development of a true recurrent lesion or a change in a residual one. Five hundred thirty-nine arteries (84%) had no postoperative abnormalities. The incidence of recurrent carotid lesions in this groups was 1.5%, 3.4%, and 5.2% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The incidence of symptoms in this group was 0.2%, 0.7%, and 1.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The earliest recurrence or symptom occurred 8 months from operation. One hundred forty-seven arteries had residual lesions that were more common when either a temporary shunt was used or the operation was carried out above the hypoglossal nerve or below the omohyoid muscle. Sixty-one patients who had plaque proximal to the arteriotomy without a significant stenosis were followed an average of 21 months. There were no changes in plaque morphology and no proven symptoms related to the residual lesion. Fifty-six patients with both plaque and significant hemodynamic abnormalities in the carotid bulb were followed an average of 18 months. Seven of these patients (12.5%) had either a significant deterioration of the lesion or a symptom from it. Each event occurred within 6 months of operation. Thirty patients had significant flow abnormalities but no visible plaque. None of these lesions deteriorated. Although common, residual carotid lesions are benign unless the lesion is characterized by both plaque within the artery and a hemodynamically significant stenosis. These lesions should be further investigated and treated when discovered.",

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal reconstruction can be applied to the successful repair of stenoses in the distal renal artery and its hilar branches. This study evaluates the short- and long-term results of extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction in 65 patients, including 5 children, with renovascular hypertension who were treated from 1974 through 1989. The mean age of the patients was 37 years (range, 7 to 67 years). The cause of the stenoses was arteriosclerosis in 8 patients, fibrodysplasia in 54 patients, and miscellaneous in 3. Hypertension was severe before treatment with a mean blood pressure of 187/147 mm Hg that was reduced to a mean of 159/102 mm Hg after medical therapy. Ten patients had renal dysfunction. Results were evaluated both at short-term intervals (mean, 7.9 months; 64 patients) and long-term intervals (mean, 5.9 years; 60 patients), after surgery. Blood pressure responses were classified as beneficial (cured/improved) or failures. Anatomic results were evaluated by angiography in 98% of the patients at the short-term interval and in 77% of the patients at the long-term interval. Extracorporeal renal artery surgery was performed on 78 kidneys among 65 patients (unilateral, 45 patients; bilateral, 13 patients; unilateral extracorporeal and contralateral in situ, 7 patients). In most of the cases autologous arterial graft was used for reconstruction. Early in the series one patient died as a result of the operative procedure (1/65, 1.5%). A beneficial blood pressure response occurred in 53 patients (53/65; 82%) at the short-term interval and in 49 patients (49/61; 80%) at the long-term interval, with the average blood pressure at the short-term interval being 138/85 mm Hg and at the long-term interval being 139/85 mm Hg. Renal function improved in all patients with preoperative renal dysfunction. Graft stenosis or occlusion of the main renal artery was neither observed at the short-term interval nor at the long-term interval. However, residual stenoses were observed in 9 of the 163 reconstructed distal branches (5.5%). Extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction with autologous arterial grafts can be effectively applied to lesions of the distal main renal artery and its hilar branches with durable functional results.",

    "abstract": "The clinical significance and applicability of interventions aimed at reducing reperfusion injury in postischemic skeletal muscle remain unproven, since long-term muscle salvage has not been demonstrated by most treatment protocols that attenuate early reperfusion injury. We have shown that reperfusion of ischemic skeletal muscle results in an early and prolonged sequestration of white blood cells and activation of the alternative complement cascade. The purpose of this study was to determine if 40 minutes of reperfusion with blood depleted of white blood cells and complement proteins, followed by 2 days of normal perfusion, would reduce muscle necrosis after 5 hours of ischemia. The isolated paired canine gracilis muscle model was used. The treatment muscle was initially reperfused with arterial blood that had been spun, washed, passed through a leukocyte removal filter, and resuspended in hydroxyethyl starch (greater than 99.9% removal of white blood cells and the complement proteins factor B and C4). The contralateral control muscle was subjected to unaltered reperfusion. Blood flow (ml/min/100 gm) was measured by timed collection of gracilis venous blood. Myeloperoxidase activity (absorbance at 655 nm/min/mg tissue protein) in muscle biopsies was used to monitor white blood cell sequestration. After 48 hours of reperfusion in vivo, necrosis was quantified by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Initial reperfusion with white blood cell and complement depleted blood significantly reduced muscle necrosis (53% +/- 3% vs 29% +/- 8%, p less than 0.0025, paired t test). Early blood flow was improved, (p = 0.0025, repeated measure-ANOVA), but subsequent white blood cell sequestration was not altered (p = 0.33, repeated measure-ANOVA). This suggests that a significant amount of white blood cell mediated injury occurs during the first 40 minutes of reperfusion. Preventing early complement activation and white blood cell mediated reperfusion injury is an intervention that is feasible during surgery and may result in clinically significant salvage of postischemic skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "As part of our initial evaluation to determine whether patients with lower extremity ischemia are candidates for intervention, arterial duplex examinations are performed in the noninvasive vascular laboratory. Patients with isolated short stenoses on the duplex examination are referred for transluminal angioplasty. One hundred thirty-four arteriograms were performed for ischemic peripheral vascular disease in 122 patients between July 1987 and March 1990. One hundred ten (82%) of the arteriograms were preceded by a lower extremity arterial duplex evaluation. Fifty cases (45%) were scheduled for transluminal angioplasty based on the findings of the duplex examination. Transluminal angioplasty was performed in 47 of 50 cases (94%). No significant differences in age, sex, or diabetes were found between the patients who were referred for transluminal angioplasty and those who were not. These data demonstrate that duplex scanning of the lower extremities allows the detection of lesions that will be amenable to transluminal angioplasty. We think that duplex scanning should become the standard screening tool for detection of treatable lower extremity lesions.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effect of elastic compression stockings on deep venous hemodynamics we measured ambulatory venous pressure, venous refill time, maximum venous pressure with exercise, amplitude of venous pressure excursion, and duplex-derived common femoral and popliteal vein diameter and peak flow velocities with and without stockings in 10 healthy subjects and 16 patients with chronic deep venous insufficiency. The effects of below-knee and above-knee 30 to 40 torr and 40 to 50 torr gradient stockings were studied. Despite documentation of substantial stocking compressive effects by skin pressure measurements, neither below-knee or above-knee elastic compression stockings significantly improved ambulatory venous pressure, venous refill time, maximum venous pressure with exercise, or the amplitude of venous pressure excursion in healthy patients or in patients with deep venous insufficiency (p greater than 0.05). In patients with deep venous insufficiency stockings modestly increased popliteal vein diameter and flow velocity in the upright resting position (p less than 0.02). After tiptoe exercise without stockings deep venous peak flow velocity increased in healthy patients and in patients with deep venous insufficiency by a mean of 103% in the popliteal vein and 46% in the common femoral vein (p less than 0.01). With the application of elastic compression stockings only modest augmentation of deep venous flow velocity occurred in both groups above that seen in the bare leg after exercise. Thus elastic compression stockings did not improve deep venous hemodynamic measurements in patients with deep venous insufficiency. The beneficial effects of stockings in the treatment of deep venous insufficiency must relate to effects other than changes in deep venous hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "We have explored the effect of arterial hemodynamics on endothelial cell morphology and low-density lipoprotein metabolism in human saphenous vein segments harvested from tissue donors. An arterial pulsatile perfusion system was used to impose physiologic pressures and flows for 20 hours on saphenous vein and companion (control) femoral artery segments. A venous perfusion apparatus was also employed for the perfusion of a second (control) saphenous vein segment for the same period of time. Calculations of fluid shearing and wall tensile stresses were performed and related to induced changes in endothelial cell geometry and cytoskeletal actin organization and the incorporation, degradation, and localization of intact low-density lipoprotein within the vessel wall. Our results indicate that, compared with native arteries and veins, a 20-hour exposure of test saphenous veins to arterial hemodynamics induced (1) a significant increase in endothelial cell luminal surface area and perimeter independent of alignment with flow, (2) disassembly of the dense peripheral band of actin with a concomitant assembly of stress fibers, and (3) a two- to fourfold elevation in the undegraded low-density lipoprotein content, localized primarily within the subendothelial intima. Although the exact mechanisms underlying these results are uncertain, the focal accumulation of intramural low-density lipoprotein may be related to the loss of normal barrier function during endothelial cell enlargement, which is accompanied by transient cytoskeletal reorganization during the adaptation to arterial flow.",

    "abstract": "Over a 14-month period patients undergoing 144 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures were evaluated for the presence of complications at the femoral puncture site. After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty each patient was examined by a surgeon, and then a color-flow duplex scan of the groin was obtained. On the initial scan eight pseudoaneurysms, three arteriovenous fistulas, one combined arteriovenous fistula-pseudoaneurysm, and one thrombosed superficial femoral artery were detected for a major vascular complication rate of 9%. Pseudoaneurysm formation was associated with the use of heparin after removal of the arterial sheath. Seven pseudoaneurysms (initial extravascular cavity size range 1.3 to 3.5 cm) were followed with weekly duplex scans, and all thrombosed spontaneously within 4 weeks of detection. The three patients with isolated arteriovenous fistulas were each followed for at least 8 weeks, and the arteriovenous fistulas persisted. Early surgical intervention for postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms is usually unnecessary as thrombosis often occurs spontaneously. We would advocate an operative approach for pseudoaneurysms that are symptomatic, expanding, or associated with large hematomas. Iatrogenic femoral arteriovenous fistulas should be considered for elective repair, but this may be delayed for several weeks without adverse sequelae.",

    "abstract": "A method of confirming carotid back pressure accuracy, variability during carotid clamping, and the clinical results with a modified back pressure shunt criterion were evaluated in 665 carotid endarterectomies. Mean arterial pressure, back pressure, and internal jugular vein pressure were measured. Cerebral perfusion pressure (back pressure-jugular vein pressure) and the collateral to hemisphere vascular resistance ratio, (ratio = [arterial pressure-back pressure]/[back pressure-jugular vein pressure]) were calculated. A shunt was used when cerebral perfusion pressure less than 18 mm Hg. Back pressure accuracy was confirmed by test occlusion of the internal carotid artery distal to the plaque. Initial back pressure values were falsely high in 83 (12.5%) carotid endarterectomies. The mean SD (n = 665, mm Hg) were arterial pressure = 84.0 +/- 9.06, back pressure = 41.0 +/- 15.9, jugular vein pressure = 6.2 +/- 3.9, cerebral perfusion pressure = 35.1 +/- 5.7, and resistance ratio = 1.85 +/- 1.44. Perfusion pressure was less than 18 mm Hg in 82 (12.3%), of which 74 (11.1%) were shunted, and 8 (1.2%) had perfusion pressure increased greater than or equal to 18 mm Hg during carotid endarterectomy with phenylephrine. Back pressure was less than 25 mm Hg in 107 (16.1%), less than or equal to 25 in 114 (17.1%), and less than 50 mm Hg in 481 (72.3%). Pressures were continuously monitored during 28 carotid endarterectomies, and all had a positive linear relationship between arterial pressure and back pressure, and minimal variability in the back pressure/arterial pressure and resistance ratios.

    "abstract": "Symptomatic renal artery stenosis is a significant and treatable clinical problem. A reliable and accurate noninvasive method of screening for renal artery stenosis has not yet been found. We used magnetic resonance imaging to study 37 patients who had undergone recent renal angiography. Fourteen patients had normal renal arteries by angiography. In 23 patients either unilateral or bilateral stenosis or occlusion was present. The disease process in all patients appeared to be atherosclerosis. The average age of the 37 patients was 68 years. The magnetic resonance scans and angiograms were read independently by two different radiologists, each of whom was blinded to the clinical history and the results of the other study. Renal arterial stenoses found on angiogram and magnetic resonance scans were graded as absent (0% to 24%), mild (25% to 49%), moderate (50% to 74%), or severe (75% to 99%). The magnetic resonance imaging results concurred with the angiographic findings in 70 of 77 arteries (91%). Magnetic resonance imaging predicted the presence of a greater than 50% stenosis of the renal artery with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94%. Magnetic resonance imaging may prove to be the best noninvasive screening test for proximal atherosclerotic renal arterial stenosis.",

    "abstract": "As CT scanning has evolved as a reliable clinical tool, the use of angiography in the diagnosis of aortic aneurysmal disease has diminished. Fewer than 25% of patients with aortic aneurysmal disease undergo aortic angiographic evaluation at our institution. A prospective clinical study was undertaken to assess the validity of this policy. One hundred patients with clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of aortic aneurysms were evaluated prospectively during the period July 1987 to December 1989. All patients underwent CT scanning as an initial evaluation. Patients were selected for angiography if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: radiographic evidence of thoracoabdominal or juxtarenal aneurysms, or horseshoe kidney; or clinical suggestion of renal artery stenosis, mesenteric arterial insufficiency, aortoiliac occlusive disease, or lower extremity aneurysmal disease. During this period 19 patients (19%) underwent both CT scanning and angiography. The indications for angiography were thoracoabdominal aneurysms (7), juxtarenal aneurysms (2), clinical evidence of mesenteric insufficiency (1) or renal insufficiency (2), evidence of lower extremity aneurysmal disease (3), or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (4). Eighty-one patients (81%) underwent CT scanning as the only radiographic evaluation. No patient was adversely affected by elimination of angiographic evaluation. CT scanning revealed inflammatory aneurysms (4), retroaortic renal veins (2), and horseshoe kidney (1). This study suggests that most (81%) patients with aortic aneurysmal disease can be adequately evaluated by CT scanning, and that a very selective policy of angiographic evaluation is indicated.",

    "abstract": "The internal mammary artery is the preferred conduit for coronary artery surgery. To determine the role, if any, of preoperative duplex imaging in assessing the suitability of this vessel, preoperative noninvasive measurements of internal mammary artery diameter and blood flow were performed in 243 patients. The left internal mammary artery was insonated through the third intercostal space by use of duplex scanner (5.0 MHz probe) before coronary artery surgery. Internal mammary artery diameter (millimeters), peak systolic velocity (centimeters/second), and mean velocity (centimeters/second) were measured, and internal mammary artery flow was calculated from velocity and cross-sectional area. In 45 of these patients the internal mammary artery diameter also was measured during surgery with a sterile caliper, and blood was collected for 30 seconds from the transected internal mammary artery to measure flow. These findings were compared to the preoperative values. In 243 patients the mean internal mammary artery diameter was 2.34 +/- 0.03 mm, and mean peak systolic blood flow was 226.7 +/- 6.3 ml/min. In the 45 patients in whom intraoperative measurements were obtained, preoperative mean internal mammary artery diameter was 2.39 +/- 0.05 mm and was not significantly different from the intraoperative mean internal mammary artery diameter of 2.36 +/- 0.04 mm. Preoperative peak systolic flow was 231.3 +/- 8.1 ml/min, and mean flow was 110.3 +/- 7.1 ml/min; intraoperative flow measured 136 +/- 3.6 ml/min. Noninvasive determinations correlated with operative findings for internal mammary artery diameter (r = 0.87) (p less than 0.05), peak systolic blood flow (r = 0.70) (p less than 0.05), and mean blood flow (r = 0.60) (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Intravascular ultrasonography is emerging as an important imaging modality to assess the presence, distribution, and extent of atherosclerotic vascular disease. To determine the accuracy and clinical utility of intravascular ultrasonography, a flexible catheter-based system was used to generate two-dimensional, cross-sectional vascular images. In 23 arteries of 11 sheep 206 in vivo images demonstrated an echo-free lumen surrounded by three distinct concentric acoustic transitions corresponding to intima, media, and adventitia. Ultrasound measurements of lumen diameter and area correlated significantly with those of corresponding arteriographic measurements obtained by use of digital calipers (r = 0.91, r = 0.86). To evaluate clinical feasibility, intraoperative images (n = 160) were obtained in 10 patients undergoing vascular bypass or hemodialysis access procedures. The images depicted luminal configuration and arterial wall morphologic characteristics. Measurements of lumen diameter and lumen area correlated closely with corresponding intraoperative arteriography (r = 0.81, r = 0.79). The ultrasound images demonstrated arterial stenoses, intimal hyperplasia, intraluminal thrombus, polytetrafluoroethylene graft material, and anastomotic sites. We conclude that flexible catheter-based ultrasonography produces images that accurately demonstrate arterial wall architecture, lumen diameter, and area. Intraoperative application can produce images that provide unique information thus expanding the clinical potential of ultrasonography as a guidance system for vascular procedures.",

    "abstract": "Despite the well characterized physiologic effects of aortocaval or iliac arteriovenous fistulas, patients with such uncommon lesions may manifest a diverse array of symptoms, and diagnosis is often delayed or overlooked. To examine clinical features that facilitate recognition and allow successful repair, a 30-year experience with 20 such fistulas was reviewed. Fourteen fistulas were caused by aneurysm erosion, four followed iatrogenic injury during lumbar disk surgery, and two developed from abdominal gunshot wounds. The interval from presumed occurrence to diagnosis ranged from 3 hours to 8 years. The diagnosis was not recognized before surgery in five (25%) patients. Back pain (70%) was the most common symptom. The presence of a typical abdominal bruit (80%) was the most reliable physical finding, but its significance was occasionally overlooked or misinterpreted. Congestive heart failure was prominent in only seven (35%) patients. Severe lower extremity edema and mottling was the primary manifestation in eight cases, often causing initial confusion with venous thrombosis. Hematuria (5 patients) and oliguric renal failure (4 patients), both fully reversible after fistula repair, also caused diagnostic uncertainty. The mean preoperative cardiac output was 12.2 L/min, falling to 5.4 L/min with fistula repair. Mean blood loss was 5960 ml, supporting use of intraoperative autotransfusion. Two operative deaths (10%) occurred, both in patients not correctly diagnosed before surgery. Despite varied modes of presentation, prompt recognition and use of appropriate operative techniques should achieve successful repair.",

    "abstract": "It has been assumed by some authors that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms may be at increased risk of rupture after unrelated operations. From July 1986 to December 1989, 33 patients (29 men, 4 women) with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent 45 operations. Twenty-eight patients had an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, and five patients had a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. The abdominal aortic aneurysm ranged in transverse diameter from 3.0 to 8.5 cm (average 5.6 cm). Twenty-seven patients underwent a single operation, and six patients had two or more (range of 1 to 6). Operations performed were abdominal (13); cardiothoracic (9); head/neck (2); other vascular (11); urologic (7); amputation (2); breast (1). General anesthesia was used in 29 procedures, spinal/epidural in 6, and regional/local in 10. One postoperative death occurred from cardiopulmonary failure. One patient died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at 20 days after coronary artery bypass (1/33 patients [3%]; 1/45 operations [2%]). Fourteen patients had repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysm at a later date, an average of 18 weeks after operation. Four patients had abdominal aortic aneurysm considered too small to warrant resection (average 3.6 cm). Four patients were considered at excessive risk for elective repair. The five thoracoabdominal aneurysm were not repaired. Four patients are awaiting repair. During this same 40-month period, two other patients, not known to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm after another operative procedure, at 21 days and 77 days. All three ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms were 5.0 cm or greater in transverse diameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "During the last decade (1980 to 1989) 186 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were admitted to a single urban hospital. Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care. Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home. Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death. No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours. From this experience we conclude that, although \"optimal\" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die. Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable. Screening of patients at high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm, followed by elective aneurysmorrhaphy, is clearly indicated.",

    "abstract": "Case records of 2026 patients operated on because of abdominal aortic aneurysms from 11 Swedish Vascular Centers were reviewed and revealed 98 cases (4.8%) of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Also included in this case-control study was an analysis of a randomized group of 82 patients from the same centers who had noninflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms. Four inflammatory aneurysms were ruptured, compared with 16 in the noninflammatory group (p less than 0.01). A higher proportion of patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms had symptoms that led to radiographic investigations. The median erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 39 mm versus 19 mm (26% of patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms had erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 50 mm; p less than 0.001), and the serum creatinine level was increased in 27 and 8 patients (p less than 0.01) in the inflammatory and noninflammatory groups, respectively. Preoperative investigations revealed ureteral obstruction in 19 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 12 had preoperative nephrostomy or ureteral catheter placement. At operation, 20 additional patients exhibited fibrosis around one or both ureters. Although ureterolysis was performed in 19 patients, preoperative and postoperative creatinine levels did not differ between these patients and the conservatively treated ones. Duration of surgery (215 vs 218 minutes), intraoperative blood loss (2085 vs 2400 ml) and complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Overall operative (30-day) mortality was equal (11% vs 12%) but was increased for patients undergoing elective surgery for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (9% vs 0%; p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Most early reports on the efficacy of laser angioplasty have used subjective symptoms rather than objective hemodynamic parameters to evaluate clinical results. We reviewed our experience with hot tip laser-assisted balloon angioplasty in 99 occluded or stenotic arterial segments during 80 procedures in 71 patients, ranging from the aortic bifurcation to the tibial-peroneal trunk. Initial failure to successfully recanalize occluded or stenotic segments occurred in 13 instances (16%). Forty-one procedure-related complications occurred in 31 patients (39%). Functional results were evaluated by use of life-table methods on the basis of symptomatic versus hemodynamic improvement. Cumulative patency rates for symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement were 91% and 64% at 1 month, 71% and 48% at 6 months, and 57% and 34% at 1 year, respectively. These data suggest that symptomatic improvement alone gives a misleadingly high estimate of the efficacy of laser angioplasty when compared with more objective hemodynamic criteria (p less than 0.005). Hemodynamic success was more likely in aortoiliac lesions than femoropopliteal lesions (58% vs 18% at 1 year, p less than 0.01). Hemodynamic parameters should be used to evaluate the success of laser angioplasty, which in its present form, is associated with frequent complications and poor long-term success.",

    "abstract": "Sixty-two patients (39 men (63%), 23 women (27%), mean age 68 years) with multilevel lower extremity arterial occlusive disease underwent simultaneous inflow and outflow operative arterial repair consisting of aortofemoral bypass in 22 (35%), axillofemoral bypass in 17 (28%), femorofemoral bypass in 15 (24%), iliac endarterectomy in 7 (11%), and unilateral aortoiliac bypass in 1 (2%), combined with 69 outflow procedures (unilateral in 55 patients, 89%), including above-knee femoropopliteal in 12 (17%), below-knee femoropopliteal in 35 (51%), femoroinfrapopliteal in 20 (29%), popliteal tibial in 1 (1%), and femoropedal bypass in 1 (1%). Multiple criteria were used to identify patients with multilevel disease likely to benefit from multilevel procedures. The operations were performed by two operating teams in a median time of 240 minutes. Prosthetic grafts were used for eight (13%) distal bypasses, the remainder were autogenous vein. There was one operative death (1.8%). The mortality rate, morbidity rate, and operative time were not significantly different from a group of patients who underwent concurrent, isolated inflow operations (aortofemoral, axillobifemoral, femorofemoral bypass or iliac endarterectomy). Mean follow-up was 14.9 months (range, 0 to 120). The life-table primary patency for the inflow procedures was 92.6% at 24 months, the outflow was 94.9% at 24 months. Cumulative limb salvage was 90.9% at 48-month follow-up. All patients with claudication were relieved of their symptoms. We conclude that complete correction of multilevel disease can be accomplished with operative time, morbidity rate, and patency equal to that of single level repair. Multilevel procedures provide complete relief of symptoms in a higher percentage of patients than has been reported after single level repair.",

Sites of stenosis included vein conduit (n = 41), anastomoses (n = 20), outflow arteries (n = 15), or inflow (n = 9) arteries. One hundred three secondary procedures consisting of vein-patch angioplasty (n = 31), sequential (n = 21) or interposition (n = 17) graft placement, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (n = 17), or excision of the lesion and primary anastomosis (n = 16) were performed to correct primary (n = 85) or recurrent (n = 18) graft stenoses. Cumulative graft patency after reintervention was 96% at 1 year, and 85% at 5 years. Stenosis or occlusion of revision sites was less after excision (0 of 16) or replacement (1 of 17) of abnormal segments compared to vein-patch angioplasty (8 of 31) or balloon angioplasty (9 of 18). Sequential or jump grafts constructed to improve graft outflow impaired by either myointimal or atherosclerotic occlusive lesions were the least durable secondary procedures. Five of eight graft failures in this series resulted from sequential/jump graft occlusion. All categories of secondary procedures normalized graft and limb hemodynamics, although only one third of patients reported symptoms of limb ischemia before revision. Surveillance of infrainguinal vein bypasses for occlusive lesions is a valid concept to salvage patent but hemodynamically-failing grafts. Secondary procedures that excised the lesion, used autologous tissue reconstruction, and normalized hemodynamics at the revision site and in the vein bypass were associated with a low incidence of restenosis and prolonged graft patency.",

    "abstract": "We have performed a prospective, randomized, multicenter study to compare in situ and reversed vein grafts for long limb salvage bypasses from the proximal thigh to an infrapopliteal artery. Three hundred eighty-four patients required an infrapopliteal bypass for critical lower extremity ischemia. Of these, 259 were excluded because a short vein bypass was performed or because the vein was considered inadequate. The remaining 125 patients had a randomized vein bypass, 63 reversed, 62 in situ. The two groups were similar with regard to risk factors, indications, graft dimensions, and outflow. Secondary patency at 30 months was similar for both techniques: reversed 67% +/- 9% (+/- SE); in situ 69% +/- 8%. For veins less than or equal to 3.0 mm in minimum distended diameter 24-month patency rates were 61% +/- 22% for 12 in situ veins and 37% +/- 29% for 10 reversed veins (p greater than 0.05). Angiographic evaluation of failing grafts revealed lesions similar in type and frequency in both types of grafts. These included focal (in situ, n = 4; reversed, n = 7) and diffuse vein hyperplasia (in situ, n = 2; reversed, n = 1), and inflow and outflow stenoses (in situ, n = 4; reversed, n = 3). The incidence of wound complications and the mortality rate were similar for the two groups. These data show no significant difference in overall patency rates for the two types of vein grafts at 2 1/2 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "During an 18-month period 33 patients in whom there were contraindications to the use of iodinated contrast arteriography underwent 40 carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriograms for lower extremity ischemia (19), severe hypertension and renal insufficiency (12), or arterial aneurysm (2). Contraindications to iodinated contrast agents included renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and contrast hypersensitivity. Sixteen aortic, 15 iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial, five aorta-iliac-femoral and four aorta-iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies were performed. In 11 studies, imaging of selected arterial segments required the addition of 10 to 60 ml of dilute nonionic contrast. Guided by carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies four femoral-tibial bypasses, three aneurysmorrhaphies, two aortorenal bypasses, one aortofemoral bypass and one femoral-femoral bypass were successfully performed in 11 patients. In addition, carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography directed angioplasties of the common iliac (4), superficial femoral (6), popliteal (3), or tibioperoneal trunk (1) were performed in 10 patients. Complications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography included transient deterioration in renal function in three patients in whom 20 ml of nonionic contrast was used, a nonfatal myocardial infarction after a popliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in one patient, and transient tachypnea and tachycardia during a carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography study in one patient. Diagnostic arteriograms are obtainable using carbon dioxide as the contrast agent. Carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography permits patients with symptomatic arterial disease at high risk for contrast related complications to safely undergo arteriography and subsequent arterial reconstruction or endovascular intervention.",

    "abstract": "Computer-assisted impedance analysis is a newly developed technique to identify femoropopliteal and distal vein graft stenoses before failure. Pulsatile flow is measured from the proximal and distal graft by use of an 8Mhz Doppler velocimeter. A pulse volume recorder measures pulsatile pressure within the thigh and calf. Fourier transfer analysis is performed on paired Doppler pulse volume recorder waveforms and an impedance score derived for the thigh and calf, respectively. In a retrospective review of 50 nonreversed femoropopliteal/distal grafts performed for limb salvage, postoperative biplanar intraarterial digital subtraction arteriography was compared with impedance analysis. Arteriography showed graft or runoff stenoses in 22 grafts (at risk) and 28 normal grafts (controls). Impedance scores were significantly higher in the at risk group (0.58 + [0.43 to 0.72]*), when compared with the controls (0.34 + [0.30 to 0.38], p less than 0.001*). A thigh or calf impedance score of greater than 0.45 was able to detect 20 of 22 stenoses, including 6 lesions in grafts with normal resting and postexercise ankle pressures. This score was then applied prospectively and compared with serial biplanar digital subtraction arteriography in a further 56 femoropopliteal/distal bypasses for limb salvage. Thirty-three of 34 lesions were successfully predicted and impedance scores were significantly higher in the at risk limbs (0.56 + [0.44 to 0.68]*) when compared with the controls (0.38 + [0.35 to 0.41], p less than 0.001*). In this series impedance analysis proved more sensitive than resting or stressed ankle pressures and, unlike Duplex scanning, was able to detect runoff as well as graft stenoses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To study the interaction of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and the means by which such interaction may affect lipid permeability of the arterial wall, cell bilayers were established by use of a transwell culture system. After confluent growth of both cell types had been achieved, iodine 125 bound to low-density lipoprotein (10 ng protein/ml) was added to the media of the upper well. After a 3-hour incubation period, the iodine 125-bound low-density lipoprotein content of the upper and lower media demonstrated an impedance to lipoprotein movement across the endothelial cell monolayer as compared to the bare porous polycarbonate filter of the transwell (p less than 10(-6)). The presence of smooth muscle cells in the bottom well significantly enhanced the permeability of the endothelial cell layer (p less than 10(-60). This effect remained unchanged over a 9-day time course. Membrane binding and cellular uptake of low-density lipoprotein by endothelial cells was not altered by smooth muscle cells, indicating that this change in permeability could not be easily attributed to changes in receptor-mediated transport or transcytosis. Membrane binding (p less than 0.02) and cellular uptake (p less than 10(-6)) of low-density lipoprotein by smooth muscle cells in the bilayer, when adjusted for counts available in the smooth muscle cell media, were both reduced in the early incubation period as compared to isolated smooth muscle cells. The disproportionate reduction in uptake as compared to binding would suggest that this was not entirely a receptor-dependent process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "An analysis was undertaken of 458 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed over 6 years with the patient under general anesthesia and with electroencephalographic monitoring. Seventy patients (15%) had electroencephalographic changes suggestive of ischemia with carotid clamping and had shunts placed. Ischemic encephalographic changes occurred in 26% of patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery, 21% of patients with a prior stroke history, and 12% of patients with no stroke history and a patent contralateral carotid artery. Nineteen strokes (4.1%), nine transient deficits (2.0%), and one death (0.2%) occurred in the 458 endarterectomies in this experience. Ten of the 19 strokes and five of nine transient deficits were immediately apparent when patients awoke from anesthesia. Five of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all five patients with immediate transient deficits had no ischemic electroencephalographic changes during the procedure. Two other patients with immediate strokes initially had ischemic electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping that reversed with increased blood pressure or shunting. Therefore 7 of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all 5 patients with immediate transient deficits had electroencephalographs unchanged from baseline at completion of the procedure, and thus deficits not manifest by operative electroencephalographic changes developed. Our data do not support the tenet that electroencephalographic monitoring will always predict neurologic deficits accompanying carotid endarterectomy.",

The technique is based on continuous-wave Doppler and duplex scanning studies done both in the resting state and during active contraction of the calf muscles. If compression of the popliteal artery occurs with contraction of the calf muscles, it will be detected by a decrease in flow. This finding will also direct the radiologist to obtain films when the maneuver is repeated. This makes it unlikely that the diagnosis will be missed. Since July 1988 a total of 1212 patients were evaluated with continuous-wave Doppler for suspected chronic ischemia. From this group 41 patients were selected to be studied again with the combined continuous-wave Doppler and duplex scanning method for possible popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. Two cases were discovered and verified by dynamic angiography guided by continuous-wave Doppler and treated surgically.",

    "abstract": "Although it normally presents a nonthrombogenic surface, endothelium is capable of procoagulant activity and suppression of native anticoagulant properties. We theorized that hypoxia could shift normal endothelium into a procoagulant state and tested this hypothesis in cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells. Human umbilical venous endothelial cells were obtained from fresh umbilical cords. Passage two cells were placed in control (PO2 greater than 120 mm Hg) or hypoxic (PO2 less than 60 mm Hg) media and incubated in control or hypoxic environments for 24 hours. In additional experiments, cells were reoxygenated for 4 or 48 hours after the initial hypoxic period. Cells were then assayed for procoagulant activity expressed as thromboplastin unit equivalents per 100,000 cells based on a thromboplastin standard curve. Results are expressed as percent increase in thromboplastin unit equivalents/100,000 cells +/- standard error versus control. Statistical significance was assessed by paired t test with p less than 0.05 considered significant. More than 95% of cells in all experimental and control preparations were viable after completion of the protocols. No morphologic variation was noted among the control and hypoxic groups. For cells rendered hypoxic without reoxygenation, the mean increase in procoagulant activity for the group (n = 4) versus control was 77% +/- 13% (p = 0.01). In the hypoxia and 4-hour reoxygenation group (n = 4), the mean increase in procoagulant activity was 141% +/- 43% (p less than 0.05). In cells reoxygenated for 48 hours after hypoxia (n = 8), the mean increase in procoagulant activity was 198% +/- 34% (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "A multicenter trial of alternative techniques for below-knee amputation is described in which surgeons in 11 centers randomized 191 patients with end-stage occlusive vascular disease to two different methods of stump construction. The skewflap technique was performed in 98 and the long posterior flap was performed in 93. The two groups were well matched in respect to age, sex, smoking, diabetes, and indications for amputation. Early outcome was compared in terms of 30-day mortality rate: skew 11 (11%) deaths versus long posterior flap 16 (17%); the state of the wound at 1 week (primary healing 60% in both groups); the need for surgical revision at the same level 7 (7%) versus 7 (8%), and revision to a higher level 10 (10%) versus 7 (8%). Follow-up information at 6 months was available from records or by mailed questionnaire in 188 (98%) at 6 months, 20 died during that interval. It showed that a prosthetic limb was fitted to 64 (84%) of skew flaps and 50 (77%) of long posterior flaps. Walking, alone or with support, was achieved in 59 (78%) and 46 (71%), respectively. None of these differences reached statistical significance. It is concluded that the skew flap is just as effective as the long posterior flap and is an excellent option for below-knee amputation.",

    "abstract": "The carotid-carotid cervical bypass is one surgical option for symptomatic atherosclerotic lesions of the innominate artery. Controversy exists regarding the necessity of surgically excluding the innominate plaque from the cerebral circuit. A canine study was instituted to characterize the hemodynamic alterations that occur in the right common carotid artery proximal to the bypass graft, termed the critical segment. The direction of flow in the critical segment determines whether emboli originating in the innominate may be propelled cranially despite a patent bypass graft. Six mongrel dogs underwent placement of an autogenous arterial crossover graft as a carotid-carotid bypass. A stenosis of the innominate artery was quantitatively altered, and an electromagnetic flowmeter measured the magnitude and direction of flow in the critical segment at three levels of diameter reduction in the innominate artery. For low-grade stenoses, flow in the critical segment was always prograde. For high-grade stenoses, the flow was always reversed. Stenoses between 57% and 67% yielded flow values of 10 +/- 24 ml/min, and it was in this range that mean flow reversal was found to occur. Even when the mean flow was near zero in the critical segment, flow was not stagnant but oscillated in antegrade and retrograde directions throughout the cardiac cycle. These data indicate that a carotid-carotid bypass causes complete flow reversal in the critical segment when there is high-grade stenosis in the innominate artery. Theoretical analysis of the hemodynamic circuit indicated that arm exercise would augment retrograde flow in the critical segment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Interval gangrene, segmental ischemic necrosis proximal to a functioning distal anastomosis, is a rare complication after successful peripheral vascular reconstruction. Previous reports have demonstrated the gravity of this event in that major limb amputation was required in all cases. Two cases are presented to emphasize the need for maintaining segmental collateral circulation after successful distal extremity bypass. Despite a satisfactory result after distal (inframalleolar) bypass of a popliteal aneurysm, one patient had progressive ischemic gangrene of the upper leg and eventually required amputation. The contralateral limb was successfully managed by distal ligation of the superficial femoral artery, which maintained collateral flow from the proximal superficial femoral artery to the knee and leg. The second patient required a microvascular free flap to replace tissue loss and provide vascular graft coverage after initial multiple bypass failures and a final successful remote reconstruction to the dorsal artery of the foot that excluded the popliteal-crural collateral network. Patients with inadequate collateral circulation or disruption of the profundus or geniculate collateral pathways may require revascularization of sequential vascular beds. Recognition of the potential for interval gangrene is essential since the likelihood of its occurrence will increase in proportion to the number of distal bypasses being performed for limb salvage. Although adjunctive procedures will not completely eliminate the possibility of interval gangrene, awareness of this phenomenon with attention to the segmental collateral circulation can decrease the incidence of its occurrence.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of aneurysmal disease was analyzed in 50 patients who were treated for 71 popliteal aneurysms. No patients were lost to follow-up (mean, 5.0 years). Initially, 25 popliteal aneurysms (25/71; 35%) were treated nonsurgically, and 46 (46/71; 65%) were treated surgically. Complications developed in 12 of the 21 asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms (57%) and in 2 of the 4 symptomatic popliteal aneurysms (50%), which were treated nonsurgically. The probability of developing complications increased with time to 74% within 5 years. When reconstruction of a popliteal aneurysm was performed, graft patency and foot salvage were 64% and 95% at 10 years, respectively. Particularly acute arterial thromboembolism was a severe presenting complication. Another important finding was the development of 23 arteriosclerotic aneurysms at other locations during follow-up in 16 patients (32%). The probability of developing these new aneurysms increased to 49% 10 years after repair of the initial popliteal aneurysm. The presence of multiple isolated aneurysms at the initial examination was the most significant risk factor limiting the survival of these patients. Consequently patients at risk could be identified early. This study confirms the limb-threatening potential of popliteal aneurysms when left untreated. Therefore prophylactic reconstructive surgery should be undertaken. Moreover, this study demonstrates that patients with a popliteal artery aneurysm have an increased risk of new aneurysm formation, both in the popliteal artery and at other locations. Therefore these patients should be followed and, in the event that new aneurysms develop, should be considered for elective reconstructive surgery to prevent limb-threatening or life-endangering complications.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging and duplex scanning in the diagnosis of catheter-induced subclavian vein thrombosis, we correlated the results of 43 arm phlebograms with duplex scans; 28 of these phlebograms were also correlated with magnetic resonance imaging scans of the thoracic veins. Eighteen of the 43 phlebograms were normal, and all had normal magnetic resonance imaging and duplex studies. Eleven subclavian veins were totally occluded on phlebography; all had duplex scans, and five were also scanned with magnetic resonance imaging. Duplex scans detected 6 of 11 occlusions, whereas magnetic resonance imaging detected 4 of the 5 occlusions scanned. The five occlusions that were not detected by either magnetic resonance imaging or duplex scans were short segmental occlusions of the medial one third of the left subclavian vein. Of 14 nonocclusive thrombi seen on phlebography, duplex scans correctly identified 8. Magnetic resonance imaging was done on eight nonocclusive thrombi but identified only two. All abnormal findings on duplex scanning and magnetic resonance imaging were confirmed by phlebography. Short occlusions of the proximal portion of the left subclavian vein were often undetected by duplex scanning but occasionally seen with magnetic resonance imaging. Neither modality was sensitive to the presence of nonocclusive mural thrombi. Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in ruling out the presence of a thrombotic process in the subclavian vein, but it may on occasion fail to detect the presence of subclavian thrombi. For this reason, in cases with suspected subclavian vein thrombosis magnetic resonance imaging cannot be used as the only diagnostic modality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The use of microvascular endothelial cells derived from omental tissue has been advocated to seed vascular grafts with autologous endothelial cells in high density. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the precise origin of these cells. Therefore we have compared cellular characteristics of these cells with those of endothelial cells isolated by collagenase treatment of human umbilical veins. The omental cells were isolated from from omental tissue from four different patients by incubation in a collagenase-dispase solution. Part of the material was processed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation in an attempt to purify the isolates. Cellular characteristics of both types of cells were determined by studying the morphologic features of the cells and by determining the presence of von Willebrand factor, antigens EN-4 and PAL-E specific for endothelial cells, cytokeratins 8 and 18, vimentin and desmin, and uptake of diI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein. Epitheloid cells from omental tissue, isolated after collagenase treatment and either purified or nonpurified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, differed from human umbilical vein endothelial cells with respect to the presence of surface microvilli, the expression of von Willebrand factor, EN-4 and PAL-E, and the presence of cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin. von Willebrand factor (in a granular staining pattern) and the presence of EN-4 and PAL-E were only detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Vimentin was present in both cell types, whereas cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin were only present in cells derived from omentum. From these data we conclude that the so called microvascular endothelial cells from omentum are not endothelial but mesothelial in nature.",

The percentage of families with at least one affected first-degree relative of the proband (multiplex families) was 15.4%. In 21.4% of multiplex families parent-offspring transmission of abdominal aortic aneurysm was noted; in the remaining families only siblings were affected. The mean age at onset among probands was 67.3 years; that among all affected was 67.4 years. No statistically significant difference in the mean ages at onset between genders was noted. Among affected siblings of probands, the sex ratio, male:female, was 1.33:1, which is not significantly different from 1:1. The relative risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm was 3.97 for fathers, 4.03 for mothers, 9.92 for brothers, and 22.93 for sisters.",

    "abstract": "Permanent ligation of arteries supplying blood to the spinal cord in operations for aortic aneurysm can lead to spinal cord ischemia, which can result in either paraparesis or paraplegia. This report describes a rapid method of intraoperative identification of those arteries that supply the spinal cord by use of an intrathecal platinum electrode to detect hydrogen in solution that has been injected into the aortic ostia. Preservation or perfusion of those identified arteries supplying the spinal cord may decrease the rate of postoperative neurologic complications. Of 28 porcine experiments with postoperative observation for 24 hours, there were 3 initial pilot experiments in which saline saturated with hydrogen was injected into the temporarily cross-clamped aorta. Twenty animals were then randomized to (1) preservation of only the vessels sequentially identified to supply blood to the spinal cord from T-13 to L-5 (n = 10); (2) division of the vessels supplying the spinal cord (n = 10). A further five animals underwent perfusion experiments wherein the identified cord arteries were perfused by a shunt, the other nonsupply arteries were divided, and the aorta was kept clamped for 45 minutes. Spinal motor evoked potentials were elicited with an intrathecal electrode and were highly sensitive for paralysis. Paralysis occurred in 0/3 pilot (p less than 0.013 vs division); 8/10 division; 1/10 preservation (p less than 0.0017 vs division); and perfusion 1/5 (p less than 0.025 vs division). Results of a pilot study in eight humans shows that the technique can be used to rapidly identify segmental arteries supplying the spinal cord, to determine if distal perfusion is supplying the spinal cord with blood flow, and if reattached segmental arteries are patent.",

    "abstract": "A rabbit model of hind limb ischemia was designed to demonstrate that new, hemodynamically significant arterial connections will develop between ischemic skeletal muscle and an independently perfused muscle pedicle flap. The right common iliac artery was divided in 15 rabbits. In eight rabbits a muscle flap based on the left deep inferior epigastric artery was transposed to the right thigh (flap group). In seven rabbits a sham operation was performed where the flap was sutured to the abdominal wall (sham group). After 7 days angiography demonstrated arterial connections between the flap and the native limb circulation in all of the flap group animals. The flap increased muscle perfusion in the ischemic limb (2.99 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the flap group, vs 2.06 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the sham group, p less than 0.005). Hemodynamically significant vascular connections will develop between a well-perfused muscle flap and an ischemic limb. The augmentation in perfusion provided by these connections can be quantified.",

    "abstract": "The need for quality assurance in vascular surgery can be deduced from the variability in unruptured abdominal aneurysm operative death rates in a group of patients large enough that factors influencing mortality rates other than quality of care can be controlled. Operative mortality rate for 3570 patients undergoing unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was determined for all non-Veterans Administration surgeons and hospitals in New York State from 1985 to 1987. The average annual number of aneurysm operations per surgeon was 3.6, and per hospital it was 10.2. Unruptured aneurysm repair mortality for surgeons performing 1 to 5 aneurysm operations per year was 10% whereas for surgeons performing more than 26 aneurysm operations per year it was 6% (p less than 0.0001). Unruptured aneurysm repair mortality for hospitals performing 1 to 5 aneurysm operations per year was 14% and for hospitals performing more than 38 aneurysm operations per year it was 5% (p less than 0.0001). Even when these mortality rates were adjusted for differences in patient age, severity of illness, secondary diagnoses and admission status, significant mortality rate differences persisted: 9% versus 4% for low and high volume surgeons, respectively (p less than 0.001), and 12% versus 5% for low and high volume hospitals, respectively (p less than 0.001). Surgeons who performed more than 7 aneurysm operations per year devoted more of their practice to aortic (11%) and vascular operations (52%) than did surgeons who performed 7 or fewer aneurysm operations per year (2% and 19%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Whether or not all of these tributaries need to be ligated at the time of bypass is controversial since many will close spontaneously. Other consequences of retained fistulas range from local skin problems to diminished graft flow and ultimate graft thrombosis. A complication not previously reported is rupture of a retained arteriovenous fistula. This unusual and potentially catastrophic complication should be discoverable at an earlier stage by periodic graft surveillance by means of duplex sonography. The routine policy of selective ligation of saphenous vein tributaries needs to be reexamined.",

    "abstract": "To determine the feasibility of the endovascular management of intimal defects while comparing the accuracy of arteriography with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasonography, we developed an in vivo model of arterial intimal flaps. In 10 superficial femoral arteries of five anesthetized mongrel dogs, intimal flaps were constructed and then imaged by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. A flexible microbiopsy forceps was used to remove each intimal flap under angioscopic guidance. Arteriographic lumen diameters were measured and cross-sectional areas calculated. Corresponding measurements by angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound with reduction in luminal area at the flap were obtained by use of computerized planimetry. Uniplanar arteriography identified 60% (6/10) of the intimal flaps, whereas angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound demonstrated 100%. Lumen diameter (in millimeters) measured by arteriography (3.4 +/- 0.6) correlated significantly with measurements by angioscopy (3.5 +/- 0.5, r = 0.77) and intravascular ultrasound (3.5 +/- 0.6, r = 0.96). Similarly, lumen area (square millimeters) by arteriography (9.2 +/- 2.9) correlated with measurements by angioscopy (8.9 +/- 2.2, r = 0.82) and intravascular ultrasound (8.6 +/- 2.7, r = 0.91). Reduction in lumen area by the flap by angioscopy (37 +/- 7%) and intravascular ultrasound (33 +/- 8%) also correlated significantly (r = 0.72). The intimal flaps were removed successfully in all 10 arteries as confirmed by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. We conclude that the endovascular management of intimal defects is possible. Additionally, angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound accurately evaluate lumen diameter and area while providing direct assessment of intimal defects.",

    "abstract": "The vascular endothelium is important in the modulation of vascular tone via production of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors. The abdominal aortas of five groups of rabbits were subjected to varying lengths of ischemia (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours), removed, sectioned into transverse rings, and placed in tissue baths containing Krebs' buffer at 37 degrees C and aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2. After equilibration the rings were tested for endothelium-dependent vasodilation with methacholine and nonendothelium-dependent vasodilation with nitroprusside. Endothelium-dependent relaxation as elicited by methacholine was impaired at 3 and 4 hours of ischemia but was not significantly different at 1 and 2 hours as compared to control, whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation remained normal throughout the different periods of ischemia. The addition of 1 x 10(-6) mol/L rabbit hemoglobin reduced the time needed to demonstrate significant impairment of endothelial function to 2 hours. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was not affected by hemoglobin. We conclude that hemoglobin exacerbates ischemia vascular dysfunction in the rabbit aorta.",

    "abstract": "A system for monitoring blood flow in femorodistal vein grafts with Doppler ultrasonography in the immediate postoperative period has been developed. Twenty-three grafts have been monitored for periods of up to 72 hours. Seventeen grafts have remained patent at minimum follow-up of 6 months, and six grafts occluded in the immediate postoperative period. Successful Doppler recordings were obtained in 16 successful and all failed grafts. Fast Fourier transform analysis of the Doppler signals was performed, and pulsatility index and time-averaged mean velocity were derived from the spectral information. Successful grafts displayed hyperemic flow with pulsatility index less than 2 and time-averaged mean velocity greater than 10 cm/sec. Failed grafts could be classified in two groups: those that occluded less than 24 hours after operation and those that occluded after 24 hours after operation. Short-term failure was categorized by highly pulsatile flow, with pulsatility index rising rapidly and time-averaged mean velocity falling correspondingly before actual cessation of flow. Delayed failure was less well defined but was suggested by failure to develop, or early deviation from, the hyperemic flow seen in successful grafts. Occlusion was heralded by development of the pulsatile pattern seen in the short-term failure group.",

    "abstract": "The effect of purified eicosapentanoic acid on intimal fibrous hyperplasia in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was examined in 18 rabbits undergoing infrarenal aorta reconstruction. Six rabbits received commercial rabbit chow (control group), six a regular diet supplemented with 1% cholesterol (cholesterol group), and six the cholesterol diet with 91.1% pure eicosapentanoic acid 500 mg/day (eicosapentanoic acid group). Grafts were harvested 3 months after surgery for histologic examination. The platelet count and serum beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 concentrations were not significantly different between groups. Serum arachidonic acid level in the cholesterol group was significantly higher than in the control group, and serum eicosapentanoic acid levels in the eicosapentanoic acid group were significantly higher than in the remaining two groups. Intergroup differences in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 concentrations were not significant. Intimal thickness at midgraft was 5.2 +/- 6.2 microns in the control group, 67.6 +/- 46.9 microns in the cholesterol group, and 19.2 +/- 18.4 microns in the eicosapntanoic acid group. intimal thickness in the cholesterol group was greater than in either the control or licosapentanoic acid group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). These data suggest that eicosapentanoic acid reduces intimal fibrous proliferation in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafting as a result of hypercholesterolemia and that this effect is independent of the platelet count, activated platelet factors, and the prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 ratio.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 25% of patients with stasis ulceration have normal or below normal ambulatory venous pressures. A reflux index was calculated by multiplying postexercise pressures by Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. In patients with stasis ulceration, reflux index was found to have an excellent negative predictive value with a clear discriminant line between normal limbs and those with ulcers. Increasing incidence of stasis ulceration was demonstrated with increasing reflux index value. Even when ambulatory venous pressure was within the normal range, the index was found to be abnormal in ulcerated limbs because Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure was elevated in these limbs. Conversely, some patients with stasis ulceration and normal Valsalva foot venous pressure elevation were found to have abnormal ambulatory venous pressure values, yielding an elevated reflux index. Preliminary analysis indicates that reflux index may be a better predictor of surgical outcome after valve reconstruction procedures than either ambulatory venous pressure or Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. The concept of reflux index is a hypothesis that attempts to explain inconsistencies observed in implicating ambulatory venous hypertension as the sole determinant of venous reflux.",

    "abstract": "Angiopeptin, a novel synthetic octapeptide, was evaluated as a new approach toward the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. Male New Zealand white rabbits (n = 22) underwent carotid artery interposition bypass grafting with autologous reversed jugular vein. Nine rabbits were in the treatment group, and 13 were in the control group. The treatment group received angiopeptin 20 micrograms/kg/day by subcutaneous injection beginning 1 day before operation and continuing for 3 weeks until they were killed. At death the vein grafts were fixed in situ with 10% buffered formalyn at 80 mm Hg perfusion pressure. Histologic sections through each vein graft were analyzed by computerized morphometric analysis for area of neointimal hyperplasia (mm2). Neointimal hyperplasia in the control animals was 0.080 + 0.017 mm2 (mean + SEM), whereas neointimal hyperplasia in the group treated with angiopeptin was 0.022 + 0.006 mm2 (mean + SEM) (p = 0.02). This is the first time that peptide inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia has been demonstrated in vein grafts and may have significant implications for future use in vascular surgery.",

Seeding theoretically reduces the probability of graft or vessel thrombosis and of neointimal fibrous hyperplasia. Thus far, clinical seeding trials disclosed modest improvements in patency and the development of hyperplastic anastomotic lesions in failed grafts. Seeding inefficiency theoretically contributes to anastomotic hyperplasia. The inefficiency is linked to two steps in the seeding process, namely harvesting and cell retention. Of these, cell retention on the seeded surface is the more critical. Priorities for future research should be set first on the retention of seeded endothelium in vitro and second on improved and standardized methods of cell harvesting.",

    "abstract": "Carotid plaque characteristics associated with the production of symptoms were identified with quantification of carotid plaque constituents in high-grade stenotic asymptomatic (n = 8) and symptomatic (n = 44) plaques. Asymptomatic plaques contained significantly more fibrous/collagen material (88%) than symptomatic plaques (66%) (p less than 0.05). Hemorrhage constituted 2% and 1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques, respectively. The predominant nonfibrous material was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol, which composed 7% of asymptomatic and 27% of symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05). No relationship was found between plaque composition and the number of ipsilateral ischemic neurologic events, nor was there evidence of a healing process. B-mode ultrasound scanning had a sensitivity of 94% in identifying plaque with greater than 80% fibrous content. We believe that plaque composition may be a useful discriminating factor in selecting asymptomatic patients for carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Fifteen patients who had undergone renal transplantation 3 months to 25 years earlier were operated on for treatment of complicated aortoiliac atherosclerosis; eight had aneurysms and seven had stenotic or obstructive lesions. Except for the first patient, operated on in 1973, in whom the kidney was protected by general hypothermia, no special measure was used to protect the kidneys. A transient increase in creatinemia occurred in 11 patients during the postoperative period, whereas creatinine values remained unchanged in the other four. All patients had regained renal function identical to the + preoperative state in less than 10 days; three of them had significant improvement as a result of correction of a lesion that was impairing renal blood flow. Results obtained in this series show that protection of the transplant during aortic surgery is not necessary, provided an adequate surgical technique is used. This technique avoids the complex methods employed in the majority of previously reported cases and appears to be a safe procedure.",

    "abstract": "Over a 12-year period, 160 transmetatarsal amputations were performed in patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The following groups were defined: group 1 - nonreconstructable disease (n = 40); group 2 - transmetatarsal amputation in conjunction with distal revascularization (n = 99); group 3 - reconstructable disease but transmetatarsal amputation performed without simultaneous revascularization (n = 21). There were nine early deaths in the entire series, for an operative mortality rate of 5.6%. The lowest rate of transmetatarsal amputation healing (24%) occurred in group 1. An 86% healing rate was achieved in group 3, but in seven cases (33%) some type of revascularization was required within 3 months of the amputation. In group 2 the healing rate was 62% but reached 83% where the bypass remained patent for at least 3 months after the amputation. Long-term patency rates also affected healing. Healing was not influenced by the number of local procedures (single vs multiple). The presence of severe infection or extensive necrosis necessitated open transmetatarsal amputation in 89 cases; the remaining 71 amputations involved primary closure. Since many patients were treated at a time when diagnostic modalities as well as the operative indications and techniques differed somewhat from the current practice, much of the information regarding group I patients in particular should be considered as a negative historical control and any conclusion from our data should be adjusted accordingly. Healing after amputation at the transmetatarsal level can be expected in the majority of instances in which revascularization can be performed with predictable patency, even when the standard criteria for performing such amputations are liberalized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the last 12 years 45 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent aneurysm resection at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Rome. The aneurysm was resected through a standard, midline transperitoneal approach in 39 patients, through a thoracophrenolaparotomy in two patients, and through a left-flank extraperitoneal approach in the last four patients. The extraperitoneal approach simplified aneurysm dissection and aortic clamping with no cases of postoperative morbidity or death. In addition, we reviewed the CT scan findings of 12 patients surgically treated for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The amount of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the aneurysm was greater than in the left posterolateral aspect (p = 0.008). We conclude that the left-flank extraperitoneal approach is the most anatomically advantageous route for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "From November 1979 through December 1989, 210 distal arteriovenous fistulas were constructed as adjuncts to tibial and peroneal vascular reconstructive procedures in 203 patients threatened with limb loss. Two-year cumulative patency rates were calculated by grouping patients on the basis of changing indications in sequential time periods: group 1 (n = 61): 1979 to 1983, 18%; group 2 (n = 80): 1983 to 1986, 33%; group 3 (n = 69): 1986 to 1989, 44%. Although the therapeutic results observed in these groups are not statistically comparable, they show a perceptible trend. Postoperative arteriography showed that flow is prograde in the distal vessels beyond the distal arteriovenous fistula. Graft surveillance by duplex ultrasonography also confirmed that flow in the distal arteries is prograde and that \"steal\" does not occur. Peak systolic velocity (174 +/- 38 cm/sec) and mean velocity (92 +/- 23) flow rates are increased in grafts with patent distal arteriovenous fistulas compared to those bypasses with closed distal arteriovenous fistulas (p less than 0.01). There were no differences in the flow measurements for the arteries beyond the distal anastomoses and distal arteriovenous fistulas, confirming the prograde nature of the distal flow. In 22 patients analysis of graft and fistula patency by duplex sonography showed that one fourth of all grafts were patent without fistulas at 1 and 2 years after operation. Alternatively, 68% of patent grafts at 1 year had patent fistulas and 58% had patent fistulas at 2 years. We conclude that the distal arteriovenous fistula will increase graft flow and simultaneously prevent distal arterial overload without causing \"steal.\" This technique should be considered whenever a prosthetic graft is necessary for crural reconstruction and only in selected instances of revascularization with autologous veins.",

    "abstract": "Conventional extraanatomic reconstruction for aortic sepsis is associated with a significant risk of operative death, as well as frequent late complications. We evaluated in situ aortic grafting in the treatment of primary or graft-related aortic infection. Eleven selected patients underwent in situ aortic graft reconstruction in the setting of mycotic aneurysm (n = 5), secondarily infected aortic aneurysm (n = 1), primary aortoenteric fistula (n = 1), and secondary aortoenteric fistula (n = 4). All patients survived: follow-up from 10 to 130 months reveals no evidence for graft thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, new or recurrent aortoenteric fistula, or subsequent aortic operations in any patient. A literature review produced 110 cases of aortic sepsis managed by in situ aortic reconstruction during the last decade. Thirty-two patients (29%) either died in the operative period or suffered a lethal late complication associated with their aortic reconstruction. This mortality rate declined to 21% if patients undergoing incomplete removal of a contaminated graft were excluded, and to 19% with the addition of our 11 patients. Both our experience and that described in the literature suggest that, in properly-selected patients, in situ aortic graft replacement may be a rational treatment option for localized or circumscribed aortic sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous vein tissue is recognized as the preferred material for extremity revascularizations that require the use of a conduit. However, the results after vascular repair of injured extremity arteries with autogenous vein interposition or bypass grafts have not been well defined. This study was done to determine both the early and late patency and limb salvage rates as well as the graft infection rate of autogenous vein repairs of injured extremity arteries. The records of 134 consecutive patients with acute extremity arterial injuries requiring repair with a reversed autogenous vein graft over a recent 5-year period were reviewed. Follow-up graft patency was defined by the presence of a palpable pulse and an extremity Doppler-derived pressure index of greater than or equal to 0.9 distal to the arterial repair. Cumulative patency was assessed by the life-table method. Acute graft thrombosis occurred in two patients, one of whom underwent successful graft thrombectomy. Four patients (3%) required extremity amputation: one patient with a thrombosed vein graft and three patients with patent vein grafts but nonsalvageable limbs as a result of myonecrosis (2) or osteomyelitis (1). No perioperative graft infections occurred. One hundred twenty-eight patients (97%) had an intact extremity and a patent vein graft at the time of hospital discharge. One hundred three patients (80%) were examined at 30 days, and all grafts were patent. Seventy-three patients (57%) were available for follow-up at intervals exceeding 6 months, and 40 patients (31%) were followed-up for periods exceeding 24 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "To determine whether color-flow imaging enhances the accuracy of noninvasive carotid evaluation, the results of carotid duplex examinations from two laboratories, one with color-flow and the other with standard duplex imaging were compared. The techniques used by both laboratories were identical. All studies were interpreted by one of the authors, using the same criteria. From October 1988 through December 1989, 307 internal carotid arteries were evaluated with both color-flow imaging and standard angiography; and 206 underwent routine duplex scanning and angiography. Perfect agreement between test and angiographic results was significantly better with color-flow (86.6%) than with conventional duplex scanning (79.6%), p = 0.034 (t test for independent samples). Significantly fewer vessels were over classified by one category with color-flow (8.5%) than with routine duplex scanning (16.5%), p = 0.006. However, no difference was found in the number under-classified by one category (4.5% vs 3.4%), p = 0.5. Although these data support the accuracy of both modalities, there appears to be a trend toward improved results with the newer method. We attribute this to more precise placement of the pulsed Doppler sample volume afforded by the color-flow image.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the paramount cause of late vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting. Lipid peroxidation, which may play a significant role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, was examined in segments of vein grafts (n = 6) harvested at reoperation for coronary disease. These were analyzed for cholesterol, phospholipid, triglyceride, and lipid peroxides. Nonatherosclerotic vascular tissues, including coronary arteries (n = 6), saphenous veins (n = 9), and donor aortic specimens (n = 11) were analyzed for comparison. Risk factors for atherosclerosis including elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, smoking, and hypertension were more frequent in patients with coronary artery disease compared to organ donors. Lipid peroxides were elevated in explanted vein grafts when compared to either saphenous vein, coronary artery or donor aorta. Lipid peroxides were not significantly different in saphenous vein when compared to coronary artery, but levels in both of these tissues were greater than in donor aorta. Although increased levels of lipid peroxides in explanted veins may simply reflect morphologic changes in these grafts, the known effects of lipid peroxides on a number of biochemical events suggest that they may contribute directly to graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms of intravascular fluid depletion after temporary occlusion of the supraceliac aorta were investigated in a canine model. During ischemia and reperfusion, hemodynamic parameters, superior mesenteric artery flow, intestinal mucosal perfusion, and mucosal permeability were monitored. After 12 hours of reperfusion, the volumes of intravenous electrolyte fluid required to maintain hemodynamic stability and fluid lost into the gastrointestinal tract and peritoneal cavity were measured. The distribution of total body water was analyzed by use of radionuclide dilution techniques. Group A animals underwent laparotomy only, group B had the supraceliac aorta occluded for 45 minutes, group C had superoxide dismutase administered after 45 minutes of aortic occlusion, and group D animals were exposed to mild hypothermia during a similar ischemia and reperfusion period. No significant difference was found in mean superior mesenteric artery flow or mucosal perfusion during ischemia among groups B, C, and D. During reperfusion superior mesenteric artery flow returned to values similar to control in all groups. Aortic occlusion increased mucosal permeability most significantly in group B (p less than 0.01). Mean intravenous fluid requirements (ml/mg) were the following: group A, 80 +/- 5; group B, 201 +/- 9 (p less than 0.01); group C, 116 +/- 7 (p less than 0.05); group D, 245 +/- 24 (p less than 0.05). Mean gastrointestinal fluid loss was highest in the hypothermic group and smallest if superoxide dismutase was given. Mean intracellular fluid volume was increased in groups B and D compared with group A (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Results of 253 consecutive bypass grafts to infrapopliteal arteries were reviewed. Most (92%) were placed for rest pain (103) or tissue loss (130). Autogenous veins were used in 175 (69%) cases, composite vein-prosthetic grafts were used in 45 (18%), and prosthetic grafts alone were used in 33 (13%). Follow-up ranged from 0 to 101 months (mean, 19 months); 37 grafts (15%) were lost to follow-up. The operative mortality rate was 4%, and 5-year patient survival rate was 44%. Limb salvage was 82% at 5 years. The 5-year patency of vein grafts (63%) exceeded that of both composite (28%) and prosthetic (7%) grafts (p = 0.005 and p = 0.00007, respectively); but the patency of composite and prosthetic grafts did not differ significantly (p = 0.29). The patency of reversed vein (59%) and in situ vein grafts (74%) was not significantly different at 5 years (p = 0.34). Patency was also not affected by the site of the proximal or distal anastomoses or diabetes. The major determinant of long-term patency in infrapopliteal reconstructions continues to be graft material. Composite grafts offered no clear advantage over prosthetic grafts, and both should be used only when there is no other alternative to amputation.",

    "abstract": "A mathematic model of unilateral iliac vein obstruction was used to establish the theoretic basis for selecting saphenous vein or a larger diameter prosthetic cross-femoral venous bypass graft for relief of obstructive venous hypertension. Common femoral vein resting and postexercise peak flows, and common femoral vein and saphenous vein diameters were measured in 18 healthy individuals and used to estimate the pressure gradient (dP) across 20 cm long cross-femoral venous bypass grafts of saphenous vein or 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm prosthetic conduits, in the presence of a transpelvic venous collateral network of varied cross section. The upper limits of normal for the gradients in our model (dPstd) were set at 4 mm Hg for resting flows and 6 mm Hg after exercise. Mean saphenous vein diameter was 4.3 +/- 0.22 mm, which was 36.5% +/- 1.73% of common femoral vein diameter. When the saphenous veins of two thirds of the individuals in our study were used as theoretic cross-femoral venous bypass conduits, greater than 80% of postobstruction peak cross-femoral venous bypass graft flow had to be carried by collaterals to maintain a gradient less than or equal to dPstd. We demonstrated that 4.5 to 6.0 mm diameter saphenous cross-femoral venous bypass grafts would be hemodynamically efficacious in relieving venous hypertension, but only when implanted in parallel with an existing venous collateral network that limited the preoperative dP to 4.5 to 7.5 mm Hg at resting flows and 7.0 to 11.5 mm Hg after exercise; only 44% of saphenous veins were adequate for cross-femoral venous bypass grafts by these criteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "It has been hoped that pharmacologic prophylaxis in thoracic aortic cross-clamping may avert the unpredictable complication of spinal cord paraplegia, may avoid the mechanical difficulties associated with shunts, partial bypass, or monitoring devices, and may serve as a substitute for or as an adjunct to cerebral spinal fluid drainage. Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05). Paraplegia was averted in all dogs treated with cerebral spinal fluid drainage, even 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that even brief periods of reperfusion interjected between ischemic episodes would increase tissue injury. Studies were performed in a rat small intestine preparation in which metabolic, hemodynamic, and histologic responses to ischemia have been well characterized. Animals were subjected to a total of 30 or 45 minutes of complete intestinal ischemia. Flow interruption was continuous (C, single episode) or intermittent (I, two or three episodes of 15-minute ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion). In some experiments 5-minute reperfusions were performed with arterial blood depleted of leukocytes (IL). This additional perturbation was included to determine the role of neutrophils that have been strongly implicated in reperfusion injury. In all three protocols histologic sections were obtained after each ischemic insult and after 1 hour of reperfusion with arterial blood. Villous histology was graded in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal and 5 = severe injury. No significant differences were found between groups in immediate postischemic histologies before reperfusion. After 1 hour of reperfusion, intermittent episodes of ischemia were associated with significantly worse histologic injury than that seen with comparable durations of continuous ischemia (30 min: I, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs C, 2.7 +/- 0.4; 45 min: I, 4.9 +/- 0.2 vs C, 2.8 +/- 0.3). However, if 5-minute reperfusions were with leukopenic blood, this effect was markedly reduced (30 min IL, 3.4 +/- 0.3; 45 min IL, 3.6 +/- 0.2). Even short periods of reperfusion during an ischemic insult greatly increased mucosal injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Cryopreserved veins used as arterial grafts may be affected by both rejection and the cryopreservation process. Experiments were designed to study changes in endothelial and smooth muscle function after cryopreservation but independent of rejection. One saphenous vein from each of eight dogs was cryopreserved for subsequent use as autografts. After 3 weeks one cryopreserved and one freshly harvested autogenous saphenous vein were implanted as bilateral femoral arterial interposition grafts. Platelet deposition was studied in vivo with indium 111-labeled platelets. At 4 weeks the autografts were removed, and the functional characteristics of the grafts were studied in organ chambers; and the ability of nerve terminals to uptake transmitter was studied with 3H-norepinephrine. Neither patency rates, blood flows, nor platelet deposition were significantly different between freshly harvested and cryopreserved grafts. Uptake of 3H-norepinephrine was significantly reduced in both grafts as compared to unoperated veins. The smooth muscle of the cryopreserved and fresh grafts contracted comparably to alpha-adrenergic agonists and endothelin. In cryopreserved grafts, the maximal tensions that developed to KCl, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and endothelin were greater when the endothelium was present compared to that developed by the smooth muscle alone. Calcium ionophore A23187 caused relaxations only in rings with endothelium; these were not significantly different between graft types. However, relaxations of the smooth muscle to nitric oxide were decreased in the cryopreserved grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Late prosthetic graft infections are commonly the result of coagulase-negative staphylococci that survive within a biofilm on prosthetic surfaces and provoke perigraft inflammation. The indolent nature and microbiologic characteristics of bacterial biofilm infections coupled with the morbidity of graft excision and extraanatomic bypass grafting prompted us to use in situ graft replacement in 15 patients admitted to the hospital with 17 infected graft segments at a mean (+/- SEM) time interval of 70 +/- 16 months after graft implantation (n = 6) or revision (n = 9). Since 1986, 17 grafts (14 aortofemoral, 2 axillofemoral, and 1 femoropopliteal) infected by bacterial biofilms have been treated. Signs on admission included femoral pseudoaneurysm (n = 7), perigraft abscess (n = 6), or graft-cutaneous sinus tract (n = 4). No patient exhibited septicemia. At operation graft incorporation was absent and Gram's stain of perigraft exudate showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no bacteria. Culture of explanted graft material isolated coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), and no growth (n = 2). All patients were successfully treated by a regimen that included parenteral antibiotics, removal of involved graft material, excision of inflamed perigraft tissue, and in situ replacement with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis. No deaths, graft thromboses, or deep wound infections occurred after operation. Recurrent graft infection did not develop during a follow-up interval that ranged from 5 to 50 months (mean, 21 months). Diagnosis of vascular prosthesis infection caused by bacterial biofilms can be based on signs at admission and operative findings. Complications of this perigraft infection can be eradicated by antibiotic administration, local debridement, and in situ graft replacement.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the accuracy of duplex scanning in diagnosing arteria profunda femoris stenoses in patients with concomitant superficial femoral artery occlusions, 123 femoral artery bifurcations were examined in 103 patients. Peak systolic and time-averaged maximal flow velocity parameters were measured in the arteria profunda femoris and compared with independently performed angiography. For detecting stenoses greater than 30% diameter reduction (50% by area) of the arteria profunda femoris, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 91% and 96%, a specificity of 85% and 98%, a positive predictive value of 86% and 98%, and a negative predictive value of 91% and 96%, for a peak systolic velocity of 180 cm/sec and more, and for a time-averaged maximal velocity of 50 cm/sec and more in the arteria profunda femoris, respectively. The day-to-day variability for peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocity parameters was low with correlation coefficients between velocity measurements on both days of 0.96 and 0.98 (n = 20), respectively. In 10 patients with arteria profunda femoris stenoses and superficial femoral artery occlusions, undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of arteria profunda femoris stenosis, the duplex scan revealed a reduction in stenotic peak systolic velocity from 330 +/- 84 to 163 +/- 50 cm/sec and a decrease in stenotic time-averaged maximal velocity from 156 +/- 47 to 54 +/- 17 cm/sec after the interventional procedure. These results show that peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocities are accurate parameters to detect significant arteria profunda femoris stenosis in patients with superficial femoral artery occlusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Vascular grafts may be salvaged with thrombolytic therapy after acute occlusion as an alternative to balloon catheter thrombectomy. From October 1987 to May 1990, 15 arterial bypasses to the lower extremity (infrainguinal saphenous vein [n = 7] or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 6], and Dacron aortofemoral bifurcation graft limbs [n = 2]) were treated for 30 occulsions with intraarterial urokinase (390,000 IU to 5,808,000 IU) infused from 3 to 40 hours. The origins of 15 graft occlusions were morphologic defects (intimal hyperplasia with anastomotic or conduit stricture), pseudoaneurysm, or progression of disease distal to the graft. Two occlusions were attributed to coagulation disorders. A cause could not be identified for 13 occlusions. Patency was initially restored to all grafts with use of thrombolytic therapy, however, adjunctive surgical thrombectomy to remove persistent thrombus from the graft or outflow vessels was required after six thrombolytic infusions. One graft in the series could not be salvaged leading to below-knee amputation. Graft defects were corrected by balloon angioplasty (n = 7) or surgical revision of the conduit (n = 8). Five significant hemorrhagic complications occurred from the catheter insertion site requiring four emergent surgical procedures and resulting in the death of a fifth patient from a myocardial infarction. This technique allows chemical thrombectomy of branch arteries distal to the graft and inaccessible to a balloon embolectomy catheter, and permits diagnosis of abnormal graft morphology that may be the cause of the graft occlusion. Graft reocclusion can be expected if technical defects in the arterial reconstruction are not revised or hypercoagulable states are not treated.",

    "abstract": "The ability to ablate atheroma without generating heat makes the excimer laser wavelength a promising intraluminal technique for the treatment of arterial occlusive disease. This series reviews a preliminary experience treating patients with superficial femoral arterial disease admitted with limb-threatening ischemia or claudication. Twenty-six diseased superficial femoral arteries (5 stenotic and 21 occluded) were treated in 23 consecutive patients. Patients with claudication (18) reluctant to undergo bypass or with limb-threatening ischemia (8) at extremely high risk for surgery were included. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 67 years. A 308 nm excimer laser with an over-the-wire catheter (19) or balloon-centered end-on catheter (7) was used followed by balloon angioplasty. Twenty-four procedures were performed percutaneously, and two were performed with the vessel open in the operating room. Technical success, defined as disobliteration confirmed by angiography and greater than 0.15 increase of the ankle/brachial index, was achieved in 15 of 26. Eleven of 21 occlusions (52%) and four of five stenoses (80%) were opened. Only two of 11 lesions longer than 10 cm were successfully treated. Unsuccessful attempts (technical failure) occurred in 11 of 26 patients and resulted in four elective and one emergency femoral-popliteal bypass. Five patients were discharged with their claudication unchanged, and one had an elective amputation. Six arterial perforations with three arteriovenous fistulas occurred, all resolved without operation. No unanticipated limb loss occurred. In the 15 successful cases, the mean ankle/brachial index increase was 0.34. Seven (47%) of these 15 remain patent with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months (1.5 to 14 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to define the clinical characteristics and outcome of surgical management of vascular complications after interventional cardiac catheterization and to contrast them to those after diagnostic cardiac catheterization. From October 1985 to December 1989, 101 patients were treated for 106 vascular complications after 1866 interventional and 5046 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Interventional catheterizations resulted in 69 vascular complications in 64 patients (frequency 3.4%). The most common interventions included coronary angioplasty (34), of which 10 required percutaneous partial cardiopulmonary bypass, intraaortic balloon pump placement (14), and aortic valvuloplasty (11). Interventional catheter-related complications included hemorrhage (33), arterial thrombosis (18), pseudoaneurysm formation (12), catheter embolization (2), thromboembolism (2), as well as arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, and arterial dissection (1 each). Fifteen of these 69 patients (24%) had suffered acute myocardial infarction just before their catheterization. Surgical repair was performed under local anesthesia in 70% of patients. Major vascular reconstructions were required in 9% of patients. Three percent of the involved lower extremities had to be amputated because of complications occurring after arterial puncture. Eight percent of the patients incurring vascular complications after interventional procedures died after operation. Diagnostic catheterizations resulted in 37 vascular complications in 37 patients (frequency 0.7%). In contrast to diagnostic cardiac catheterization, vascular complications after interventional cardiac catheterization occurred more frequently, were most often due to hemorrhage at the vascular access site, and occurred in high-risk, critically ill patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Decreased cardiac output and increased plasma thromboxane have been observed during aortic cross-clamping under general anesthesia. Amelioration of these changes has been reported by preoperative administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, but heterogeneity in patients' intravascular volume status has confounded analysis of the drugs' effects in previous studies. We studied hemodynamic conditions in 24 volume-loaded (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than 10 mm Hg) patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair under general plus epidural anesthesia, after preoperative double-blind administration of either ibuprofen 800 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The hemodynamic response to aortic cross-clamping was similar in both groups. Pulse and mean arterial pressure remained unchanged; cardiac index decreased after aortic cross-clamping from 2.4 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) to 2.1 +/- 0.1 1/min/m2 in the ibuprofen group and from 2.5 +/- 0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.2 1/min/m2 in the placebo group (p less than 0.01 versus preclamp values in both groups, multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA]), but improved after declamping. Both left and right ventricular stroke work indexes followed a similar pattern. Plasma 6-keto prostaglandin Fl alpha (6-k-PGF1 alpha) increased transiently from a baseline level of 304 +/- 44 to 2083 +/- 698 pg/ml plasma in mixed venous blood 30 minutes after incision in the placebo group (p less than 0.05), but no other significant change in plasma 6-keto prostaglandin Fl alpha or in thromboxane B2 occurred in either group at any other time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The hemodynamic and metabolic consequences of microvascular occlusion, often present in the runoff bed of distal arterial reconstructions, have been difficult to quantitate clinically. To investigate these pathophysiologic relationships, a porcine hindlimb model was developed in which arteriolar patency, which we term outflow capacity, may be quantitatively defined and reduced by serial distal microembolization with 70 microns flow-directed glass bubbles. In 10 anesthetized adult pigs, hindlimb perfusion was limited to femoral artery flow (FAF) by collateral ligation. Serial measurements of outflow resistance (OR), femoral artery flow, and resting muscle pH (mpH), a metabolic index of tissue perfusion, were made as relative outflow capacity (ROC) underwent graded reduction from 1.0 (baseline) to 0 (complete occlusion). Femoral artery flow decreased linearly (FAF = 87 ROC - 3), and outflow resistance increased in hyperbolic fashion (OR = 1.66/ROC) in response to graded peripheral microembolization, whereas resting muscle pH followed a more complex relationship (In mpH = 0.055 ROC + 1.95). An integrated analysis of these results suggests that a 50% to 60% reduction in arteriolar patency represents a critical point beyond which outflow resistance rises rapidly and hindlimb flow decreases to levels that are inadequate to support the metabolic demands of resting tissues.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of carotid surgery on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography and ocular pneumoplethysmography were performed on 36 patients who underwent unilateral carotid endarterectomy. Ocular pneumoplethysmography and transcranial Doppler sonography tests were performed within a week before and after operation, and transcranial Doppler sonography was repeated greater than or equal to 30 days after operation. Middle and anterior cerebral arteries were insonated bilaterally, and flow velocities ipsilateral (iMCAFV or iACAFV) and contralateral (cMCAFV or cACAFV) to the side of surgery were recorded. The iMCAFV and iACAFV increased significantly in the immediate postoperative period, and the iMCAFV remained elevated on the second follow-up study. Patients with greater than or equal to 75% ipsilateral carotid stenosis (N = 23) had increased iMCAFV, iACAFV, and decreased cACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% stenosis (N = 13) had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. Those with greater than or equal to 75% contralateral carotid stenosis (N = 17) had significant increases in iMCAFV, cMCAFV, and iACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% contralateral carotid stenosis had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. A subset of patients (N = 13) did not increase iMCAFV after surgery. The ocular pneumoplethysmography changes were significantly different in both groups when preoperative and postoperative values were compared. We conclude that carotid endarterectomy can cause lasting cerebral hemodynamic changes, but that its effects are not uniform among all patients.",

    "abstract": "Although several approaches for exposure of distal internal carotid artery lesions have been reported, the precise anatomic levels for which each of these maneuvers are most appropriate have not been well described. Since these techniques may require preoperative preparation, it is useful to determine in advance how much exposure will be needed and to select the most suitable and effective technique. We used anatomic dissection in 12 human cadaver specimens (24 carotid bifurcations) to define the limits of distal internal carotid artery exposure by several commonly advocated methods. The standard anterior approach along the sternocleidomastoid muscle allowed exposure of the internal carotid artery to the level of the upper one third of the second cervical vertebra. The upper limit of this exposure was extended to the middle of the first cervical vertebra by division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Anterior subluxation of the mandible increased the distal exposure of the internal carotid artery to the superior border of the first cervical vertebra. Styloidectomy in combination with the preceding maneuvers extended the exposure an additional 0.5 cm cephalad. Lateral mandibulotomy did not significantly extend exposure beyond that obtained with mandibular subluxation and styloidectomy. Exposure of the internal carotid artery in the 1 cm immediately below the base of the skull required a posterior approach with mastoidectomy.",

    "abstract": "We compared duplex scanning, \"bright blood\" and \"black blood\" magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography for evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries. All three methods were applied to 39 vessels in 20 patients. Duplex scanning was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in six instances. In three instances the degree of stenosis was overgraded by the scanner, and in three cases the stenosis was undergraded. Magnetic resonance angiography was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in three instances. In all cases magnetic resonance angiography overgraded the degree of stenosis. By use of a greater than 70% stenosis as a positive study, the sensitivity of magnetic resonance angiography was 100% and the specificity 92%. With use of the same criteria, the sensitivity of duplex scanning was 86%, and specificity was 84%. In those evaluations where the results of the magnetic resonance angiography and duplex scanning were in agreement, the correlation with conventional angiography was 100%. We conclude that magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative means to duplex scanning for noninvasive carotid imaging. A combination of bright and black blood magnetic resonance angiography is precise in delineating lesions of the extracranial carotid artery and may ultimately eliminate the need for conventional angiography in the evaluation of carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Despite a large experience with \"blind\" retrograde valvulotomy in in situ vein bypass grafting, the incidence of residual competent valves remains high, and valvulotome-induced injury is common. In this study we describe a new valvulotome and technique of angioscopically directed valvulotomy and review the video tape recordings of 85 completion angioscopies of in situ femorodistal bypasses. Fifty-three vein grafts were prepared with the blind retrograde valvulotomy technique and 32 vein grafts with the new valvulotome and angioscopy. The use of the new valvulotome and technique is compared with that of the standard blind retrograde valvulotomy technique, and the normal endoluminal anatomy and incidence of primary disease in saphenous vein grafts was noted. The incidence of valvulotome-induced injury was 5/32 (15.6%) and 45/53 (85%) in vein grafts prepared with angioscopically directed valvulotomy and blind retrograde valvulotomy, respectively. Residual competent valves were found in 10/53 (18.9%) in blind retrograde valvulotomy and 0/25 of angioscopically directed valvulotomy vein grafts (p = 0.0114). In 22/53 vein grafts unsuspected primary disease was detected. Angioscopically directed valvulotomy with the new valvulotome and technique is feasible, reliable, and safe. It avoids residual competent valves, minimizes valvulotome-induced injury, and allows the detection and correction of unappreciated primary vein graft abnormalities. The new valvulotome and technique is a first step in the complete endoluminal preparation of the in situ vein graft.",

    "abstract": "Valvular incompetence associated with venous ulceration can occur in the superficial, deep, or perforating systems. Duplex imaging was used to evaluate 95 extremities (78 patients) with current venous ulceration to determine the location of incompetence in each extremity. In addition, in 91 of the 95 extremities the area of the venous ulcer was evaluated for the presence of perforating veins or any other superficial veins or both conditions. Sixty-three (66.3%) of the 95 extremities had multisystem incompetence (superficial and perforating plus superficial and deep plus perforating and deep plus superficial and perforating and deep), whereas single system incompetence (superficial plus perforating plus deep) was seen in only 26 (27.3%). Isolated deep incompetence was identified in only two extremities (2.1%). Furthermore, 45% (41/91) of the ulcers had no duplex evidence of any venous abnormality in the ulcer bed. These data show that the site of valvular incompetence occurred in multiple locations, that isolated valvular incompetence of the deep venous system was uncommon, and that perforating veins were not always in the ulcer bed itself. Because standard venous surgery has traditionally been directed toward only one system, this may provide one explanation for ulcer recurrence. Therefore complete venous evaluation with duplex imaging allowing for surgical intervention directed specifically to the sites of involvement in each system is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Fifty-seven patients underwent repair of atherosclerotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms between 1978 and 1990. Five patients had urgent surgery for rupture. The 30-day operative mortality rate for the entire group was 18% (10 patients). Before July 1987, 19 patients (group 1) were operated on by use of a technique previously described. In these earlier patients the peritoneum was routinely entered, the diaphragm was divided radially, and no heparin was given. Among patients in group 1 there was a 30-day operative mortality rate of 42% (8 patients), and morbidity included myocardial infarction 4 (21%), respiratory failure 9 (47%), renal failure 12 (63%), bleeding requiring reoperation 4 (21%), and intestinal ischemia 3 (16%). Since July 1987 a standardized approach to all elective thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms has been used in 38 patients (group 2). This method uses a left thoracoabdominal incision, circumferential division of the hemidiaphragm, retronephric totally extraperitoneal aortic exposure, single lung anesthesia, full heparinization, the graft inclusion technique, and liberal use of visceral endarterectomy. Patients in group 2 sustained a 30-day operative mortality rate of 5% (2 patients) and morbidity included myocardial infarction 2 (5%), respiratory failure 10 (26%), renal failure 11 (29%), bleeding requiring reoperation 1 (3%), paraplegia 6 (16%), and paraparesis 4 (11%). Modern surgery for repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm results in acceptably low operative mortality rates. Spinal cord ischemia remains an unresolved source of morbidity.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if intraarterial vasodilating drugs could augment the vasodilation produced by sympathetic blockade, such as occurs during epidural anesthesia. Papaverine (2 mg/min), nitroglycerin (1 microgram/kg/min), aand saline were infused into the femoral artery before and after lumbar sympathectomy in six arterially isolated canine hindlimbs. Femoral blood flow was controlled with a perfusion circuit at baseline (80 ml/min), half-baseline (40 ml/min), and low (5 ml/min) flow rates so that hindlimb mean arterial pressure served as an index of peripheral vasodilation. At low flow, hindlimb arteriovenous oxygen content difference increased from 1.4 (baseline) to 6.2 ml O2/dl, consistent with peripheral ischemia. At baseline flow before sympathectomy, papaverine and nitroglycerin caused a decrease in hindlimb mean arterial pressure of 30% and 18%, respectively (p less than 0.01 vs saline control), equivalent to the decreases of 31% and 16% after sympathectomy (p less than 0.01). At half-baseline, papaverine and nitroglycerin reduced hindlimb mean arterial pressure by 22% and 12%, respectively (p less than 0.01), and caused comparable vasodilation after sympathectomy. Neither drug significantly changed hindlimb mean arterial pressure at low flow. Sympathectomy itself reduced hindlimb mean arterial pressure by 23% at baseline flow (p less than 0.01), by 18% at half-baseline flow (p less than 0.01), but had no effect at low flow. We conclude that intraarterial papaverine and nitroglycerin cause peripheral vasodilation that is synergistic with sympathectomy-induced adrenergic blockade, but they cannot augment vasodilation caused by peripheral ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Financial data of 102 patients undergoing elective and emergent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair over a 3-year period were evaluated in terms of postoperative length of stay, net revenue, total standard cost, and net margin. Cost reimbursement was based on diagnosis related group payments. Aneurysm repairs were classified as emergent, high-risk elective, or low-risk elective. A net loss of $409,459 was noted for the entire series. Emergent repairs, although only 12% of the population, accounted for 73% of total losses, with a mean loss of $24,655/patient. The mean net loss in the high-risk elective group was $3590/patient, and a net gain of $1132/patient was noted in the low-risk elective group. Length of stay outliers, defined as length of stay greater than 28 days, contributed to the bulk of the losses in the elective series and were predominant in the high-risk group. No preoperative comorbidity, other than high-risk classification, predicted outlier status. Length of stay correlated with total standard costs in all categories of aneurysm repair. Third party payment for length of stay outliers was inadequate; the diagnosis related group system warrants revision so that outlier reimbursement will be based on a tiered system derived from length of stay.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 collagen, minimally cross-linked, was used to bind one of three antibiotics (amikacin, chloramphenicol, or rifampin) to double-velour Dacron grafts to develop a prosthesis resistant to infection. Six millimeter disks of graft were placed in separate flasks (specific for each antibiotic) containing albumin in saline and continuously agitated. At daily intervals the solution was changed, and paired graft samples were removed and placed on a blood agar plate confluently streaked with bacteria. The initial zone of inhibition (centimeters squared), the time to 50% reduction of initial inhibition zone, and the overall duration of antibacterial activity were recorded on an exponential model. Grafts bonded with amikacin and chloramphenicol had an overall duration of activity of only 2 and 1 day, respectively, against Staphylococcus aureus. The collagen bonded rifampin grafts had an initial zone of 14.76 cm,2 took 3.92 days to reach 50% of initial inhibition, and had an overall duration of activity of 22.4 days. This was significantly better than grafts preclotted with 1.0 ml of rifampin (60 mg/ml) and 9 ml of blood (10.92 cm,2 1.06 days, and 5.6 days). When tested against a slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (American Type Culture Collection No. 35983), the graft bonded with rifampin had inhibitory activity of up to 27.77 days with a 50% of activity eluted at 4.78 days, significantly better than the preclotted rifampin graft without collagen bonding. These data suggest that rifampin bonded by collagen can protect a vascular graft against infection from S. aureus and S. epidermidis for up to 3 weeks after implantation.",

    "abstract": "To determine the safety of intraaortic balloon pump catheter insertion for critical coronary ischemia through suprainguinal prosthetic bypass grafts, we examined our experience of 19 intraaortic balloon pumps placed through grafts in 17 patients by means of surgical exposure (8) or the percutaneous (11) approach. Fourteen intraaortic balloon pumps were placed through matured grafts at a time remote (2 to 13 years; mean, 7 years) from their vascular bypass surgery. Five were inserted through nonmatured grafts during the same hospitalization as their vascular reconstructive surgery (1 to 12 days; mean, 4 days). One patient, a day after an aortoiliac bypass, died during an urgent, surgical intraaortic balloon pump insertion for cardiogenic shock. All other patients had prompt reversal of their cardiac ischemia. Decreased limb perfusion developed during use of the intraaortic balloon pump in three patients, all of whom had their intraaortic balloon pump placed percutaneously through mature grafts. Two of these required surgical thrombectomy. Ten intraaortic balloon pump insertions in eight patients survived the hospitalization and were followed for a mean of 24 months (range, 2 weeks to 64 months). No localized groin or graft infections were identified. No bleeding complications or pseudoaneurysms occurred. Thus in patients with unstable, severe, cardiac disease, intraaortic balloon pumps can be safely placed through indwelling suprainguinal bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "Vascular grafts in canines exhibit similar healing patterns to humans in that the graft surface forms a pseudointima over time but endothelializes only near the anastomotic sites. Thus the pseudointima at the midportion of the graft may represent a nidus for persistent platelet activation. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of the maturing graft surface on platelet activation. Long Dacron subcutaneous carotid to aorta grafts (50 cm x 8 mm) were placed in nine dogs. Blood samples were obtained by direct graft puncture, at the proximal and distal ends of the graft, at 1, 24, 48, 72 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks, and monthly thereafter for 8 months. Seven sham dogs had subcutaneous grafts implanted without arterial anastomoses, and blood samples were drawn from the femoral artery. Platelet counts were determined with a platelet counter. Platelet aggregation and release of adenosine triphosphate was determined with a whole blood aggregometer by use of arachidonic acid, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate as agonists. No difference was found in platelet aggregation to collagen or adenosine diphosphate stimulation across the graft, but platelets released significantly less adenosine triphosphate to collagen and adenosine diphosphate stimulation distally versus proximally. In the graft dogs a decrease in systemic platelet counts of 50% occurred from the preoperative level which persisted over 8 months (p less than 0.01). Also less response occurred to collagen and ADP stimulated platelet aggregation in the graft animals than the sham animals during the first month of study. These data suggest that significant platelet-graft interactions occur even after the graft has formed a mature pseudointima.",

Sixty-five percent of these patients were men, 25% were diabetic, and 94% were smokers, with an average age of 62 years. Patients were followed for a mean interval of 24 months. Life-table survival was 92% at 3 years. All surviving patients showed \"significant\" postoperative improvement by use of Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery combined clinical and vascular laboratory criteria. There were three early and five late graft thromboses. Primary and secondary life-table patencies were 85% and 92%, respectively, at 3 years. Dacron bifurcation grafts were selected to match the size of native arteries. Patients receiving small diameter grafts, defined as 12 mm (n = 9) and 14 mm (n = 39), were compared with patients receiving large diameter grafts of 16 mm (n = 26) and 18 mm (n = 5). Small diameter grafts were more likely to be used in women (p less than 0.01), but patient groups were otherwise comparable with respect to age, smoking history, diabetes, outflow status, operative indications, type of proximal anastomosis (end-to-end or end-to-side), location of distal anastomosis (common femoral vs deep femoral), type of graft construction (knitted vs woven), and functional result. Graft diameter did not influence life-table patency, which was 84% for small and 87% for large diameter grafts at 3 years (p = 0.74). Furthermore, none of the other variables listed above influenced graft patency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The original operation was a Dacron aortobifemoral bypass for aortoiliac occlusive disease in an institution other than ours. The patient was referred for the treatment of the infection of the prosthetic implant. We inserted a prosthetic bypass from the left axillary to the left deep femoral artery, as well as a crossover autogenous saphenous vein graft from the prosthesis to the right deep femoral artery; in the same operation the infected intraabdominal prosthesis was removed with closure of the proximal aortic stump. Subsequent stenosis of the vein graft made it necessary to insert a prosthetic bypass between the descending thoracic aorta and the two deep femoral arteries. Infection of the last named prosthesis made it necessary to remove it and replace it with a tailored allogenic arterial allograft between the infrarenal abdominal aorta and both deep femoral arteries. The patient had an uneventful recovery as the infection was controlled and both lower limbs were salvaged. Eighteen months later the allograft was patent without any signs of degeneration. Further clinical experience under appropriate conditions may prove the use of allografts effective in the treatment of selected cases of aortic prosthetic infection.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels resulting from spontaneous rupture of aneurysms are rare, with only 31 cases having been reported since 1971. Clinical diagnosis is possible when a unique set of findings is present, namely high-output cardiac failure, a pulsatile abdominal mass associated with a bruit or thrill, and unilateral arterial insufficiency or venous engorgement. Recently, with advancements in diagnostic techniques, the number of cases in which an arteriovenous fistula is found between the common iliac vessels has increased. Diagnosis can be difficult, however, as in the case of one of our patients in whom the predominant sign was acute renal failure. Other reports of renal failure or impairment in the presence of a common iliac fistula have also appeared. Awareness of this phenomenon can help the physician to establish the diagnosis when one or more of the classic signs are absent. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management have contributed to the high incidence of survival in patients with arteriovenous fistulas between the common iliac vessels.",

    "abstract": "One hundred consecutive patients with intermittent claudication were screened noninvasively with electrocardiography chest wall mapping stress test and transcutaneous aortovelography during bicycle ergometry. Electrocardiographic chest wall stress testing indicated three-vessel coronary disease in 25 patients and left anterior descending plus circumflex (left main stem equivalent) disease in seven. In these 32 patients transcutaneous aortovelography demonstrated a decrease in stroke distance (an index of cardiac stroke volume) (median, -28%; 90% range, +5% to -48%), and coronary angiography confirmed the presence and severity of the disease. The claudication distance ranged between 50 and 250 meters. After myocardial revascularization or medical therapy a significant increase occurred in the stroke distance after exercise (median, +20; 90% range, +40% to -25%); also a significant increase in the postexercise pressure index and a reduction in the recovery time (p less than 0.01). No change occurred in the ankle/pressure index at rest. Twelve patients were able to walk without being limited by claudication; 15 reported improvement with a two to tenfold increase in claudication distance. No change occurred in three. The results indicate that silent myocardial ischemia is a common finding in patients with intermittent claudication. It produces left ventricular dysfunction and a decrease in stroke volume leading to a large fall in ankle pressure and early onset of claudication during exercise. Niltrates and myocardial revascularization tend to reverse this.",

    "abstract": "Although Buerger's disease is known to be closely related to smoking, no objective analysis of the smoke-associated problems has been performed. In this study, cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, was used as a sensitive marker to measure levels of active smoking and the exposure of nonsmokers to tobacco smoke because it has a relatively long half-life and because cotinine levels can be determined by noninvasive means in urine. According to urinary cotinine levels, 40 patients with Buerger's disease were classified as (1) smokers: those with urinary cotinine levels above 50 ng/mg creatinine; (2) passive smokers: those with levels between 10 and 50 ng/mg creatinine; and (3) nonsmokers who did not experience noticeable passive smoking: those with levels below 10 ng/mg creatinine. There were 10 smokers, 9 passive smokers, and 21 nonsmokers. The course of the disease, after the initial treatment at our hospital, was studied retrospectively. Seven of the 10 smokers, none of the 9 passive smokers, and 4 of the 21 nonsmokers experienced aggravation of the disease. Of the four nonsmokers who experienced aggravation, three had still been smokers and one had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace at the time of relapse. There was a significant difference in the aggravation rate between the smokers' group and the other two groups. Among the smokers, the seven patients whose conditions worsened showed significantly higher cotinine levels than the three remaining patients who were in the stage of remission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Rabbit external jugular veins, normally unresponsive to serotonin (5-HT), develop a constrictive response when grafted into the arterial circulation. The mechanisms responsible for this alteration were examined in this study. The right external jugular vein was grafted into the right carotid artery in 37 New Zealand white rabbits. The vein grafts were harvested at 3, 7, 9, 14, and 28 days after operation; contralateral external jugular veins were harvested at 9 days in six animals. Rings of these vessels were mounted under isometric tension, and dose-response curves to 5-HT were obtained. None of the grafts harvested at day 3 responded to 5-HT. All the grafts harvested from day 7 through day 28 constricted to 5-HT. The maximal response increased from 258 +/- 30 mg at 7 days to 734 +/- 108 mg at 28 days. No change occurred in the sensitivity to 5-HT with time. The increase in maximal response was paralleled by a linear increase in percent intimal area (intimal area/intimal + media areas) from 11.6% +/- 2.1% at 3 days to 48.7% +/- 1.9% at 28 days. Preincubation with ketanserin, a 5-HT2 and alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift in the 5-HT dose-response curve. The median effective dose for 5-HT increased progressively from 1.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) mol/L (in the absence of ketanserin) to 6.1 +/- 1.7 x 10(-5) mol/L (ketanserin 8 x 10(-7) mol/L; p less than 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis, a disease that is important in the pathophysiology of vein graft failure. Hypertension can also alter arterial vasoreactivity. The vasomotor function and histologic characteristics of autogenous vein grafts in hypertensive rabbits were assessed in this study. Hypertension was induced in 13 male New Zealand white rabbits by use of the Goldblatt one clip two kidney method. The right carotid artery was divided and bypassed with the reversed right external jugular vein 7 days later in these animals and in 13 normotensive controls. Blood pressure and renal function were assessed serially, and all the grafts were harvested after 28 days. Three grafts in each group were examined by light microscopy. The responses of the remaining grafts to norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin, and angiotensin II were determined in vitro under isometric tension. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and calcium ionophore (A23187) was assessed in precontracted grafts. The mean arterial pressure was significantly increased after the Goldblatt procedure was performed. Intimal hyperplasia was observed in both groups, but the grafts in the hypertensive groups showed increased adventitial and medial fibrosis and a reduced number of vasa vasora. The grafts in the hypertensive rabbits were hypersensitive to all agonists as indicated by a significant reduction in their median effective dose values, and their maximal responses to all agonists were also significantly reduced. No graft relaxed in response to acetylcholine, and whereas precontracted grafts in normotensive rabbits had a maximal relaxation of 24% +/- 6% of precontraction with A23187, this was absent in the grafts in the hypertensive rabbits. The results suggest that angiotensin-induced hypertension may adversely affect vein graft patency by inducing hypersensitivity to physiologically important agonists and reducing the effect of receptor-independent endothelium-derived relaxation on vasomotor tone.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional ultrasonography and color Doppler were used over an 18-month period for the diagnosis and management of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms in six patients with pulsatile groin masses found after catheterization. A diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm was made when color Doppler demonstrated pulsatile systolic flow into echolucent masses. One patient underwent surgical repair of a symptomatic pseudoaneurysm after the initial Doppler study. Serial color Doppler studies were performed in five subjects, all of whom showed resolution of flow after a mean of 18 days (range 7 to 42). Despite an absence of flow, one patient underwent surgical drainage of persistent hematoma. After a mean interval of 233 days (range 84 to 552) all patients have remained free of other complications or symptoms related to the pseudoaneurysm. This experience suggests that urgent surgical repair is not required in all cases of small iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms, and that asymptomatic patients can be safely followed with serial color Doppler examinations.",

    "abstract": "Thirty-nine patients with penetrating carotid injuries were treated between 1975 and 1987. All were war victims. On admission 27 (69%) had no neurologic deficit (group I), 8 (20.5%) had a mild neurologic deficit (group II), and 4 (10.5%) had a severe deficit (group III). Repair was undertaken in 38 of 39 (97.5%) patients, and carotid ligation was performed in 1 case (2.5%). Associated injuries were found in 25 (65%) patients. All patients survived. At the time of discharge all group I and II patients had a normal neurologic examination. One patient in group III recovered completely, whereas two had significant improvement. One patient remained unchanged. We conclude that repair should be attempted in all patients with carotid injuries who are seen early (less than 120 minutes) after the accident.",

Vasospasm probably plays an important role in the pathophysiology of this injury, in addition to the more accepted roles of thrombosis and endarteritis. Three patients with severe, upper extremity ischemia after intraarterial injection of heroin, methamphetamine, and meperidine were treated with intraarterial tolazoline and streptokinase, along with intravenous heparin. All three patients had improved perfusion, assessed both clinically and by angiography. The responses to treatment in these patients demonstrated the roles of vasospasm and thrombosis in the origin of this injury and the therapeutic benefits of appropriately administered vasodilators and thrombolytic agents.",

    "abstract": "A specific inhibitory factor was isolated from human serum of a patient who manifested impaired prosthetic graft tissue incorporation. The latter reaction was hypothesized to be related to inhibiting fibroblast proliferation by a specific humoral factor. The crude inhibitory serum was tested against a pool of normal human sera with different cell types in culture. Proliferation of human skin fibroblast and human smooth muscle cell cultures incubated in the presence of 50% inhibitory serum were inhibited up to 58% and 37%, respectively. Proliferation of bovine capillary endothelial cell cultures was stimulated under similar conditions. Isolation and purification of the inhibitory factor from crude serum were initiated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellet was further fractionated by sepharose 6B gel filtration. The inhibitory activity was eluted from the column in a relatively purified form as indicated by gel electrophoresis of the inhibitory fractions, which demonstrated a specific band corresponding to the inhibitory protein, with an apparent relative molecular mass of 230 kDa. The inhibitory factor showed a high affinity to concanavalin A, indicating its nature as a glycoprotein not associated with albumin or immunoglobulin fractions of the serum.",

    "abstract": "Endothelin-1, a 21-amino acid peptide secreted by endothelial cells, has constrictor and mitogenic activity for vascular smooth muscle cells, and its mitogenic activity is synergistic with that of platelet-derived growth factor. Endothelial cell-derived endothelin-1 might therefore contribute to intimal hyperplasia in reendothelialized segments of vascular grafts or of endarterectomy and angioplasty sites. Because intimal hyperplasia occurs most often at sites with disordered flow patterns and lower fluid shear stress, we tested the effects of static culture versus high laminar shear stress (25 dyne/cm2) on endothelin-1 precursor (preproendothelin) gene mRNA transcript levels and endothelin-1 peptide release in cultured human endothelial cells. Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subjected to controlled levels of shear stress in parallel plate flow chambers for 24 hours. To detect preproendothelin mRNA we applied a linked reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) to RNA extracted from cultures. Southern blots of RT/PCR reaction products were hybridized with radioactive phosphorous (32P) labeled probes for the amplified preproendothelin complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). Detection by RT/PCR of mRNA for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to measure a constitutively expressed control signal. Endothelin-1 release into culture medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Application of 25 dyne/cm2 of shear stress for 24 hours sharply reduced endothelial cell levels of precursor preproendothelin mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Four of 32 reported sarcomas related to the aorta have arisen around previously placed aortic vascular prostheses suggesting that the graft may have been an etiologic factor. Our recent experience with such an angiosarcoma arising around a Dacron aortic graft prompted a review of the lesion to identify risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options. The diagnosis of these sarcomas is seldom made before operation. Animal studies have implicated plastic polymers including Dacron as carcinogenic materials capable of inducing sarcoma in 7% to 50% of exposures. Because of the rarity of these tumors and the thousands of vascular implants used over the past 30 years, it is unlikely that this degree of risk can be extrapolated to humans. However, a tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of any mass or thromboembolic event associated with a vascular prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "To minimize intraoperative blood loss a watertight knitted Dacron aortoiliac prosthesis has been developed by impregnation with bovine collagen. A potential disadvantage is that collagen may be associated with an increase in thrombus formation. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortoiliac operation as such on the coagulation mechanism during the first 10 days after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 21). Twelve patients who underwent cholecystectomies served as controls. Three markers of the coagulation mechanism were monitored: beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. We found no significant differences in median beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product levels between patients in the collagen-impregnated prosthesis group and patients in the nonimpregnated prosthesis group. This indicates that collagen does not stimulate the coagulation cascade any more than conventional Dacron protheses do. In a comparison of patients who underwent aortoiliac reconstruction and patients who underwent cholecystectomies, the results indicated a significant increased platelet activation and fibrin metabolism in aortoiliac reconstruction group compared with the control group. Finally, we observed a significantly higher preoperative fibrin metabolism in patients with vascular disease than in control subjects. This difference is attributable to the high preoperative fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product values in patients with aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Management of patients after operative repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms can be further complicated if primary closure of the abdominal wall cannot be technically accomplished or is associated with profound increases in intraabdominal and peak inspiratory pressures. We recently treated five patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and one patient with a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm whose abdominal incisions had to be closed with a Dacron reinforced, silicone sheet. All patients were hemodynamically unstable either at admission to the hospital or became so during operation. Four patients required the insertion of a silicone rubber sheet at the primary operation because of massive retroperitoneal hematoma or edema of the bowel wall or both. Incisions in two patients were closed primarily, but the patients required reexploration and secondary closure with silicone rubber sheets because of the development of marked increases in peak inspiratory pressures, intraabdominal pressures, and decreased urinary output. Four of the six patients subsequently underwent successful removal of the silicone rubber sheets with delayed primary closure of the abdominal wall, and two others died before removal. The patient with the ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm died on postoperative day 20 because of pulmonary sepsis but had a healed abdominal incision. The three surviving patients have been discharged. A silicone rubber sheet may be necessary for closure of the abdominal wall after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients where primary abdominal wall closure is impossible or where it results in compromise in respiratory or renal function.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that biomaterials differentially induced macrophages to secrete growth factors that mediate reendothelialization. The present study evaluates the effect of an atherogenic diet on macrophage/biomaterial interactions. Female New Zealand white rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from these as well as rabbits fed a normal diet and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium with platelet-poor serum. Dacron or polyglactin 910 were added to two of three conditions of both cell groups in passage 2. Conditioned media were collected weekly through week 15. Mitogenicity assays were performed with quiescent mouse embryonal (BALB/c3T3) fibroblasts, atherosclerotic rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells, and murine capillary lung (LE-II) endothelial cells. Mitogenic activity was assayed by scintillation counting of tritiated thymidine incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Results showed increased mitogenic activity released by macrophages from atherosclerotic rabbits, in the absence of prosthetic material, when assayed against every cell line. In normal diet macrophages, polyglactin 910 stimulated mitogen release for every cell line, and Dacron yielded minimal mitogen release. In lipid diet macrophages polyglactin 910 slightly increased mitogen release for all three cell lines, whereas Dacron resulted in stimulation of DNA synthesis in smooth muscle cells and BALB/c3T3 cells but less DNA synthesis in LE-II cells than in control, no graft material, media. Western blotting demonstrated immunoreactivity to basic fibroblast growth factor in media from normal diet macrophages but only in the presence of polyglactin 910 or Dacron. Radioimmunoassay for platelet-derived growth factor B chain was negative in all groups, and polymerase chain reaction techniques to amplify transforming growth factor-beta messenger ribonucleic was negative. These data demonstrate the effect of in vivo dietary manipulation on macrophage activation as well as the effect of an atherogenic diet in modulating macrophage/biomaterial interactions. Additionally, different biomaterials differentially induce macrophages to release factors that stimulate and inhibit growth.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the underlying mechanisms associated with the loss of responsiveness of veins grafted into the arterial circulation. In particular, the possibility that the altered response is related to modifications of the biologic properties of the vascular smooth muscle, of the endothelial cells or both was tested. Segments of jugular veins were grafted in the reverse position into the carotid arteries in rabbits. After 4 weeks the patent vein grafts and unoperated veins were removed, and endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (nitric oxide, SIN-1 [the active metabolite of molsidomine32]) relaxations were studied in vitro. In unoperated veins, acetylcholine, nitric oxide, and SIN-1 induced a concentration-dependent relaxation in the presence and absence of the endothelium, respectively. These relaxations were associated with a time-dependent accumulation of guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP). Both relaxation and production of cyclic GMP were inhibited by methylene blue and hemoglobin. Unstimulated veins with endothelium had a significantly higher content of cyclic GMP than did preparations without endothelial cells. This difference was abolished by hemoglobin and methylene blue. In vein grafts acetylcholine induced only minor endothelium-dependent relaxations, whereas nitric oxide and SIN-1 evoked concentration-dependent relaxations in preparations without endothelium, which were shifted significantly to the right compared to unoperated veins. In vein grafts the endothelium-mediated production of cyclic GMP (basal and stimulated by acetylcholine) was significantly reduced when compared to that in unoperated veins, and that evoked by SIN-1 was not different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A 25-year-old man was admitted with thoracic outlet syndrome in the C8-T1 nerve roots. The first rib was removed through a supraclavicular approach with excision of the medial clavicle. All symptoms disappeared. On histologic examination fibrous dysplasia was found in the rib. Tumors of the first rib are uncommon and are rarely responsible for thoracic outlet syndrome. When the tumor is very large, as in our case, we recommend a supraclavicular approach associated with excision of the medial clavicle. During the liberation of the brachial plexus, great care should be exercised to avoid nerve injuries. Because malignancy of the tumor cannot be eliminated with certainty before or during the operation, wide excision of the entire rib is recommended.",

    "abstract": "A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of a blue, painful right index finger, and the condition progressed to digital ulceration. The ulcer gradually healed over a period of 2 months. Peripheral pulses, Doppler-derived brachial and radial systolic pressures, and results of an echocardiogram were normal. Digital pulse volume recordings showed obstructive waveforms in all digits of the right hand. Arteriography showed a normal arch and normal innominate, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The midbrachial artery was markedly abnormal and had alternating areas of stenosis and aneurysm formation. Multiple occlusions involved the palmar arch and proper digital arteries. The abnormal brachial artery segment was excised and replaced with an autogenous reversed saphenous-vein conduit. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be medial fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia that involves upper extremity arteries is extremely uncommon and rarely presents with digital artery embolization. This case emphasizes the importance of exclusion of proximal reconstructible arterial occlusive disease by means of complete arteriographic examination of patients who were admitted with unilateral finger or hand ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery stenosis with resultant renovascular hypertension has attracted clinical attention because the disease is potentially curable and because numerous diagnostic and therapeutic modalities compete for clinical acceptance. An exercise-mediated disturbance of renal hippurate transport was recently described, and has been implicated as having a role in nephrogenic fixed hypertension. To predict the final course of renovascular hypertension before operation we carried out a prospective study with the goal of verifying the predictive value of exercise hippurate scintigraphy. The study was to test the hypothesis that patients with disturbance of renal hippurate transport (pathologic renogram) induced by exercise would have stabilized hypertension and would continue to be hypertensive after operation. Thirty-one patients with hypertension who had unilateral or bilateral renovascular stenosis documented on angiography were referred to rest and exercise hippurate scintigrams before operation. The results of the examinations at rest served as standard and were compared with the exercise scintigrams. In 19 of the 31 (61%) patients a disturbance of transrenal hippurate transport evolved during exercise, whereas 12 (39%) patients failed to respond to exercise with altered hippurate kinetics. Twenty-six patients went on to renovascular operations; five had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Revascularization results differed markedly when the blood pressure response of patients with positive results on exercise (abnormal) and patients with negative results on exercise (normal) were compared. Ten of 12 patients with hypertension who had normal exercise renograms were cured. In comparison, blood pressure values were little influenced by therapy in patients with an abnormal response, where 17 of 19 patients continued to have hypertensive disease after therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of unsuspected renal artery stenosis among patients with peripheral vascular disease has been reported to be as high as 40%, but the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses in these patients is not known. The biplane aortograms of 205 male patients who were military veterans and had aneurysms or occlusive disease were independently reviewed, and medical records were studied to determine associated coronary disease, risk factors, and patient outcome. Fifty-six patients (27%) had a 50% or greater stenosis in the celiac or superior mesenteric artery, and seven patients (3.4%) had significant stenoses in both mesenteric arteries. Patients with celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were older (p = 0.002) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.029) than those without significant mesenteric stenoses. Fifty of the 205 patients had significant renal artery stenoses, and 20 had advanced (greater than 75% diameter loss) renal stenoses. Ten of the 20 patients (50%) with advanced renal stenoses had a concomitant celiac artery stenosis, compared to 40 of the 185 patients (22%) who did not have advanced renal stenoses (p = 0.011). In the present study asymptomatic celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were common among male veterans evaluated for peripheral vascular disease, but the prevalence of significant stenoses in both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries was low. The prevalence of significant celiac stenosis was higher in patients with advanced (greater than 75%) renal artery stenoses who might be considered for prophylactic renal revascularization. Lateral aortography with evaluation of the celiac artery is always appropriate in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis of the present study is that axillofemoral bypass grafting for acute vascular occlusion has results significantly inferior to an elective procedure. We reviewed 53 patients undergoing primary axillofemoral bypass grafting at the University of Virginia from 1984 to 1989. We found that patients who were admitted with acute vascular occlusion had a higher incidence of perioperative complications (63% vs 26%, p = 0.001), perioperative mortality (26% vs 3%, p less than 0.05), lower graft patency at 1 year (60% vs 90%, p less than 0.05), lower rate of freedom from reoperation in first year (50% vs 82%, p less than 0.01), and lower rates of limb salvage (76% vs 94%, p less than 0.05) than patients undergoing axillofemoral bypass grafting for chronic symptoms or conditions. These two groups did not differ in any of the other risk factors or perioperative characteristics examined. We conclude axillofemoral bypass grafting performed for indications other than acute vascular occlusion is associated with acceptable morbidity, mortality, graft patency, and limb salvage rates.",

    "abstract": "Conventional vascular anastomoses between autogenous vessels are performed with nonabsorbable sutures. Recently, use of absorbable sutures and laser-assisted vascular anastomoses has been advocated because of their improved healing characteristics. This study compared arterial repairs with the argon laser, absorbable suture, and nonabsorbable suture for technical characteristics including additional suture and overall success rates, burst strength, and cost. Absorbable and nonabsorbable suture closures were comparable with respect to technique, but laser-assisted vascular anastomosis was technically more demanding and required almost twice as much time for completion. The argon laser successfully closed only 58.6% of the arteriotomies, and 90% of the closures required additional sutures for complete hemostasis. All sutured arteriotomies were successfully completed by use of either absorbable or nonabsorbable suture. Burst strength was similar for all groups, but was uniformly greater than 300 mm Hg for sutured repairs, whereas two of five laser-assisted closures burst below 300 mm Hg. Finally, costs for purchasing ($35,000) and operating ($300/hr.) an argon laser make laser-assisted vascular anastomosis much more expensive than sutured repair. These data suggest argon laser-assisted vascular anastomoses are more technically demanding, less successful, and more expensive than conventional sutured anastomoses when evaluated in large caliber arteries in a canine model. Absorbable suture, however, is comparable to conventional nonabsorbable sutured arterial repairs in expense, handling characteristics, and success rates with the added advantage of eliminating permanent foreign body in the arterial wall when it is absorbed.",

    "abstract": "An arteriotomy is a commonly used surgical technique. Either a transverse or a longitudinal incision can be made, but no study has been done to determine if one technique results in more stenosis or flow disturbance than the other. Six-millimeter arteriotomies were made on the carotid and femoral arteries of six dogs. Transverse arteriotomies were made on the right, and longitudinal arteriotomies were made on the left. Four weeks later the vessels were reexplored. Duplex scanning was used to assess the amount of turbulence at each arteriotomy. Afterward, latex casts of the arteries were made to determine the percent stenosis caused by each arteriotomy. The mean percent stenosis associated with transverse arteriotomies was 10.5% (+/- 4.4%), versus 22.8% (+/- 9.4%) for the longitudinal arteriotomies, (p = 0.001, matched t test). No difference in the amount of turbulence associated with each technique was demonstrated. A longitudinal arteriotomy results in significantly greater stenosis than does a transverse arteriotomy. Unless there is a specific indication for a longitudinal arteriotomy, a transverse arteriotomy should be used.",

    "abstract": "Septic complications after cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty are distinctly uncommon. However, we have recently treated nine patients with sepsis and life-threatening complications after cardiac catheterization alone or after catheterization and subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The common denominator in all patients was either repeat puncturing of the ipsilateral femoral artery or leaving the femoral artery sheath in for 1 to 5 days after the procedure. Two patients died as a direct result of their septic complications. One death occurred in a patient in whom bacterial endocarditis with congestive heart failure developed, and the other patient had a large retroperitoneal hematoma that became secondarily infected. Infected aneurysms that were successfully treated developed in three patients. Our study suggests that colonization of the needle tract by skin flora predisposes to septic complications if repeat arterial punctures are required or if a femoral artery sheath is left in place for more than 24 hours. Patients in whom sepsis develops after these procedures should be initially treated with antibiotics effective against gram-positive organisms. CT scanning or angiography should be considered for patients with persistent sepsis, septic emboli, and abdominal or flank pain. Infected aneurysms require resection or ligation because of the propensity of these aneurysms to rupture.",

The present study was undertaken to assess the value of 18 clinical parameters, of 7 clinical scoring systems, and of quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging for predicting the occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Vascular surgery was performed in 125 patients. Thirteen postoperative cardiac events occurred, including 10 cardiac deaths and 3 nonfatal infarctions. Clinical parameters were not useful in predicting postoperative outcome. All 63 patients with normal scan results or fixed perfusion defects underwent surgery uneventfully, whereas 21% (13/62) of patients with reversible defects had a postoperative cardiac complication. By use of quantitative scintigraphic indexes we found that patients with reversible defects could be stratified into intermediate and high-risk subgroups with postoperative event rates of 5% (2/47) and 85% (11/13), respectively, despite intensive postoperative monitoring and antianginal medication. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who had a postoperative cardiac event. By use of quantification we found that patients with reversible defects can be stratified into an intermediate risk subgroup that can undergo surgery with minimal complication rate and a high-risk subgroup that requires coronary angiography.",

    "abstract": "A multicenter review of 602 procedures was performed to evaluate the effects of thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty on the superficial femoral artery. Four hundred thirty-nine (73%) patients underwent laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for claudication, and 163 (27%) underwent the procedure for limb salvage. Two hundred ninety-two laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures were performed for multifocal stenotic disease (greater than 80%) diameter reduction), 258 for total occlusion, and 52 procedures for both superficial femoral artery stenosis and occlusion. The initial recanalization rate was 89% (538/602) depending on the length of the lesion. Success of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was verified by angioscopy or arteriography, and all patients underwent segmental Doppler studies before discharge and during midterm follow-up extending to 30 months (mean, 11.3 months). Complications occurred in 62 (10%) patients, but only one limb amputation occurred because of a complication related to a laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Overall, 60% of initially successful procedures have remained patent, but long segment (greater than 7 cm) occlusions have fared poorly (25% patency at 30 months). This minimally invasive technology affords the opportunity to treat short segment (less than 7 cm) symptomatic superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with minimal risk. Initial success and midterm patency rates for appropriate lesions appear to make laser-assisted balloon angioplasty a viable adjunct in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for the evaluation of retention of endothelial cells seeded on vascular grafts are limited by the inability to specifically identify and quantitate seeded cells on a long-term basis. To address this problem we developed a method of quantification of graft surface coverage using genetic labeling of endothelial cells combined with computer-assisted image analysis. Rabbit aortic endothelial cells were transduced with a marker gene (lac-Z) and seeded on polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. After histochemical staining in which the genetically labeled cells turn blue, computer-assisted image analysis was used to measure the percentage of graft surface covered by the seeded cells. The utility of the method was evaluated by using it to assess the effect on graft coverage of seeded cell density and by precoating with fibronectin. Quantification of surface area coverage was automated and reproducible both between scans and between observers. Use of this method allowed the determination of a linear correlation between cell density in the seeding suspension and graft coverage (r2 = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). The method also permitted confirmation of the positive contribution of fibronectin coating to graft coverage by seeded cells: 73% coverage coated versus 8% coverage uncoated (p less than 0.0001). The ability of this method to specifically identify genetically marked endothelial cells and their progeny makes it attractive for use in studies targeted at optimization of graft coverage in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Motor evoked potential monitoring was tested as an alternative to somatosensory evoked potential monitoring in evaluating spinal cord function during thoracic aortic occlusion in dogs. Twenty-seven animals underwent 60 minutes of cross-clamping of the proximal descending thoracic aorta with (n = 18) or without (n = 9) cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Spinal cord blood flow was measured with microspheres, and neurologic outcome was evaluated at 24 hours with Tarlov's scoring system. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage improved neurologic outcome (p less than 0.05). Motor evoked potentials recorded over the lumbar spinal cord were lost in 9 of 20 dogs with ischemic cord injury and were not lost in any of the 7 dogs that were neurologically normal. Somatosensory evoked potential were lost in 19 of 20 paraplegic/paraparetic dogs and lost in 3 of 7 normal dogs (p less than 0.01). After reperfusion, motor evoked potentials returned in all nine neurologically injured dogs that lost the potentials and were still present at 24 hours. Changes in amplitude, latency, or time until loss or return of motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials did not predict neurologic injury. Loss of somatosensory evoked potentials had a high sensitivity (95%) but had low specificity (67%) because of peripheral nerve ischemia. Loss of motor evoked potentials recorded from the spinal cord had high specificity (100%) but a low sensitivity (46%) and was therefore not a reliable predictor of neurologic injury. Return of motor evoked potentials during reperfusion did not correlate with functional recovery. Motor evoked potentials stimulated in the cortex and recorded from the spinal cord had low overall accuracy (59%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The development of aneurysmal disease involving the rarely encountered celiomesenteric anomaly is extremely unusual. Aneurysmal disease of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries is itself an extremely uncommon finding, accounting for less than 10% of all visceral artery aneurysms. The existence of aneurysmal disease involving a celiomesenteric anomaly has been alluded to only briefly in two previous clinical reports. We review the case of a young woman with aneurysmal disease involving a common celiomesenteric trunk. The patient underwent excision of the aneurysm with successful vascular reconstruction. Although extremely unusual, the development of this extremely rare lesion can be predicted on the basis of specific etiologic theories. Variations in the patterns of embryologic formation of the visceral arteries account for the development of celiomesenteric anomalies, whereas atherosclerosis, medial degeneration, and infection lead to the development of most visceral aneurysms. Surgical treatment of celiac or mesenteric aneurysms is almost always indicated. Awareness of potential vascular anomalies and patterns of collateral circulation are necessary for appropriate surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "To determine if there is a relationship between aortic graft dilation and graft complications, 443 serial ultrasound studies performed on 106 patients were analyzed. Of 443 studies, 243 were done retrospectively on 59 patients from 3 to 144 months (mean, 38 months) after graft implantation. Forty-seven additional patients were studied prospectively, with direct measurement of external graft diameter after aortic clamp release. Subsequent ultrasound examinations at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually (n = 200) were routinely performed. Mean follow-up was 12 months (range, 3 to 48). Knitted double velour Dacron prostheses were used in all cases reported in this study. This cohort was culled from our ongoing graft surveillance program, which includes grafts of other materials and manufacturers. Comparison of the manufacturer's recorded box size with follow-up ultrasound measurements in all cases demonstrated a mean increase in graft diameter of 3.7 mm (23%). Little dilation occurred after 1 year. In 47 patients with direct graft diameter measurements taken after declamping, an immediate mean increase of 1.7 mm (11%) was noted. Dilation was not related to surgical indication (aneurysm vs occlusive disease) or hypertension. Analysis of the 10% segment of the series with the greatest dilation (mean, 39%) did not demonstrate a predilection for graft complications. No significant dilation was noted in the single cases encountered of femoral and iliac anastomotic aneurysms and perigraft seroma. Although dilation of knitted Dacron grafts is to be anticipated, no association between graft dilation and graft complications was found in this series.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative monitoring has demonstrated that administration of heparin on an empirical basis is associated with a wide variation in patient response and elimination rate. This problem may be overcome by intervention on the basis of perioperative monitoring or by using forms of heparin with different pharmacokinetic properties. When compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin has a higher bioavailability after subcutaneous administration, a linear clearance mechanism with a prolonged half-life, and is at least as effective in preventing postoperative vein thrombosis. Theoretically these characteristics of low-molecular-weight heparin could lead to more predictable levels of heparin activity. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin after an intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortic graft surgery. Heparin activity was measured before heparin administration and at 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 minutes after administration. The anti-Xa activity in the low-molecular-weight heparin group showed less variation and was more sustained when compared to the unfractionated heparin group. Fibrin degradation products were moderately correlated with the anti-factor Xa levels of the low-molecular-weight heparin group, but no correlation was found in the unfractionated heparin group. The anti-factor Xa activity of low-molecular-weight heparin was, in contrast to that of unfractionated heparin, not completely reversible by protamine administration. The blood loss was comparable in both groups. In contrast to what was expected, the pharmacokinetic profiles of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin showed a similarity after intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortobifemoral bypass grafting. Factors that could have influenced the pharmacokinetic behavior of heparin are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Thrombomodulin, a membrane glycoprotein present on normal vascular endothelium, binds circulating thrombin and is important in protein C activation. These functions contribute to the nonthrombogenic nature of endothelium. Damage during harvest and ex vivo storage of vein grafts may result in dysfunction of this endothelial anticoagulant barrier and possibly contribute to early graft thrombosis. We studied the functional activity and antigenic expression of thrombomodulin on saphenous veins before (initial) and after (harvested) harvest and storage for coronary artery bypass grafting in 15 patients. Also, fresh saphenous vein was studied after mechanical endothelial stripping. After storage for 2.7 +/- 0.6 hours at room temperature in heparinized saline, thrombomodulin functional activity in harvested vein segments was 28% less than initial segments (p = 0.08). Endothelial stripping resulted in a 79% reduction in thrombomodulin activity compared with initial segments (p = 0.04). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed thrombomodulin antigen on vein grafts after harvest and storage, but not on segments stripped of endothelium. Thrombomodulin functional activity and antigenic expression on human saphenous vein grafts is not significantly changed by harvest and relatively short periods of storage at room temperature in heparinized saline.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the usefulness of CT scanning before carotid endarterectomy, a prospective study was performed on 469 consecutive patients considered for carotid endarterectomy during a 5-year period. All patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography. Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had transient ischemic attacks, 109 (23%) had a prior stroke, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic. Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with stroke. Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of stroke had an abnormal CT scan outcome. Of patients with a stroke documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar infarcts, and 92 had cortical infarcts; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient. CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected infarcts or tumors. Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients. Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case. Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery. Three perioperative strokes (1.3%) occurred. CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications. Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone. Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Hip disarticulation, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "The clinical, duplex, and angiographic findings in six patients with seven spontaneous extracranial carotid artery dissections are reported. Four dissections resulted in internal carotid artery occlusion. These patients complained of ipsilateral headache followed by contralateral hemiplegia. The other three dissections involved the common carotid artery and resulted in dual (one true and one false) lumens. Two of these dissections were asymptomatic. All dissections were treated nonoperatively with anticoagulant therapy. Neurologic deficits improved or disappeared in all symptomatic patients. On follow-up studies, one of the four internal carotid occlusions completely resolved with normalization of the duplex examination. All three dual lumen dissections remained patent on serial studies. Diagnostic duplex characteristics, both conclusive and supportive, of carotid dissections are described. Duplex scanning is shown to be accurate in diagnosing and ideally suited for serially following spontaneous carotid dissections.",

    "abstract": "A 10-year-experience of 217 femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments in 207 patients is reported. Thirty-three femoropopliteal bypasses (15%) were performed with reversed saphenous vein and 184 (85%) with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Operative indications were gangrene in 121 (56%), nonhealing ulceration in 40 (18%), ischemic rest pain in 51 (24%), and claudication in 5 (2%) cases. The 5-year primary graft patency rate of these bypasses was 59% (reversed saphenous vein, 74%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55%; p less than 0.05), the secondary 5-year graft patency rate was 61% (reversed saphenous vein, 79%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 56%; p less than 0.05), and the 5-year limb salvage rate was 78% (reversed saphenous vein, 78%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 78%). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the 5-year patient survival rate was 38%. Eleven patients (5%) required lower extremity amputation because of progressive gangrene or extensive infection despite a patent bypass to an isolated popliteal artery segment. We conclude that femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments (1) have acceptable 5-year graft patency and limb salvage rates; (2) should be performed with reversed saphenous vein grafts when possible; (3) may be performed with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts if necessary, with a resulting limb salvage rate equal to that of reversed saphenous vein grafts; and (4) require sequential extension to an infrapopliteal artery in up to 20% of patients. In addition, the presence of an isolated popliteal artery segment is associated with a high operative mortality rate and limited life expectancy because of coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Vascular reconstruction for chronic intestinal ischemia can be accomplished by endarterectomy or aortomesenteric bypass. In our practice, antegrade bypasses from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are currently the most frequently used techniques. Such reconstructions often use multiple or bifurcated large diameter vascular prostheses and have demonstrated excellent long-term patency. Despite these salutory results, we have noted an unusual perioperative response in three of these patients, which is the subject of this report. All three patients underwent uncomplicated elective mesenteric revascularization with grafts (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) originating in the supraceliac aorta. Indications for operation included (1) history of postprandial pain, (2) documentation of weight loss, and (3) angiographic evidence of advanced atherosclerotic disease with appropriate collateral development. Episodes of abdominal pain occurred 5 to 20 days after operation when normal food intake was reinstituted. In two patients immediate angiograms revealed patent grafts with diffuse mesenteric vasospasm. Treatment with intravenous hyperalimentation and nifedipine for 10 days resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. In the third patient, symptoms were totally relieved by temporary reduction in oral intake and administration of nifedipine. A later angiogram revealed a patent graft. All patients have remained asymptomatic and regained normal weight. This pattern of postrevascularization pain has not been seen in our patients undergoing revascularization with small (i.e., venous) conduits originating in the infrarenal aorta. The cause appears to be a heightened myogenic response of a \"protected\" vascular bed when suddenly exposed to the high perfusion pressure and blood flow of large caliber antegrade conduits. Prophylaxis with calcium channel blockers and use of smaller diameter grafts (5 mm) may avoid this disturbing syndrome.",

This study reviews 150 femoral artery injuries that occurred in 16,350 patients over a 5-year period. A prospective computerized cardiac catheterization data bank was used to determine significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of vascular injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that congestive heart failure, female gender, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or valvuloplasty procedure were significantly associated with occurrence of vascular injury. Greater age, smaller body surface area, and smaller weight were also associated with injury. Recommendations for management include an aggressive approach to obstruction even if local vascular reconstruction is required. False aneurysms are studied by ultrasonography, and small ones may be observed expectantly. Larger aneurysms and aneurysms that persist beyond a few days are managed by use of general or regional anesthesia and by gaining proximal control of the iliac artery. Arteriovenous fistulas resulting from catheterization are rarely hemodynamically significant and often close spontaneously. Thus repair should be delayed.",

    "abstract": "To assess renal duplex sonography as an intraoperative study to detect technical defects during repair, 57 renal artery reconstructions in 35 patients were studied. Sixteen men and 19 women (mean age, 62 years) underwent unilateral (13 patients) or bilateral (22 patients) renal artery repair to 57 kidneys. Methods of repair included aortorenal bypass grafting in 29 cases (20 saphenous vein, 5 polytetrafluoroethylene, 4 Dacron), reimplantation in 7, transrenal thromboendarterectomy with patch angioplasty in 13, and transaortic extraction thromboendarterectomy in 8. Branch renal artery repair was required in six cases (five in vivo, one ex vivo). Fourteen patients had combined aortic replacement (11 patients: 8 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 3 aortic occlusions) or visceral artery reconstruction (three patients: three superior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomies, one inferior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomy). Intraoperative renal duplex sonography (mean scan time, 4.5 minutes) was complete in 56 of 57 repairs (98%), and renal duplex sonography was normal in 44 repairs (77%). Overall, B-scan defects were present in 13 repairs (23%). Six of these (11%) were defined as major B-scan defects by Doppler spectra with focal increases in peak systolic velocity greater than or equal to 2.0 meters/sec (major defect, mean renal artery peak systolic velocity, 3.1 m/sec), which prompted immediate operative revision. Seven B-scan defects were defined as minor by Doppler spectra (minor defect, mean renal artery, peak systolic velocity, 0.7 m/sec) and were not revised. Postoperative evaluation (range, 1 to 22 months; mean follow-up, 12.4 months) of 55 renal artery repairs in 34 operative survivors (surface renal duplex sonography, 33 patients; renal angiography, 9 patients) demonstrated 42/43 renal artery repairs with normal intraoperative renal duplex sonography, and 6/6 repairs with minor B-scan defects were patent and free of critical stenosis. Of the 6 renal artery revisions prompted by major B-scan defects, 4 remained patent, 1 stenosed, and 1 occluded. Our experience suggests that intraoperative renal duplex sonography during renal artery repair provides valuable anatomic and physiologic information. Renal artery repairs with normal renal duplex sonography and minor B-scan defects without Doppler spectral changes demonstrated 98% patency without critical stenosis at 12.4 months of mean follow-up. However, major B-scan defects defined by a focal increase in renal artery peak systolic velocity should be considered for immediate correction.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important determinants of graft patency is the degree and character of vascular outflow. This study was designed to evaluate input impedance as a functional assessment of the outflow bed of vascular grafts. Four distinct outflow environments were created for external jugular vein conduits in 42 New Zealand white rabbits. Vein grafts (n = 14) were fashioned as end-to-side common carotid interposition bypass grafts. Arteriovenous fistulas (n = 15) were created by side-to-side anastomosis of the distal common carotid artery and linguofacial vein. Arteriovenous fistulas with outflow obstruction (n = 7) were fistulas with a metal clip partially obstructing the distal outflow channel (1 mm lumen). Vein graft/arteriovenous fistula combinations (n = 6) consisted of a vein graft and arteriovenous fistula in series. Pressure and flow in the external jugular vein were measured, and input impedance spectra were calculated by Fourier methods. By use of a PC-based acquisition and processing system, impedance results for 20 cardiac cycles could be obtained in approximately 10 minutes. The results revealed that vein grafts typically demonstrated high resistance to steady state flow (Rin = 235 +/- 50 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5) and steadily decreasing impedance to pulsatile flow resulting in a characteristic impedance (Z0; average of fourth to tenth harmonics) of 35.5 +/- 8.0 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5. Phase angle values were usually negative, especially at low harmonics (first harmonic phase angle = -1.11 +/- 0.10 radians) indicating that flow led pressure. In contrast, arteriovenous fistula Rin was minimal (6.3 +/- 1.4 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to vein graft, and the impedance was flat across the frequency spectrum (Z0 = 8.5 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05) with pressure and flow nearly in phase (first harmonic phase angle = -0.05 +/- 0.10 radians). Creation of outflow obstruction in arteriovenous fistulas resulted in significantly elevated Rin (136 +/- 41 x 10(3) dyne/sec . cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to arteriovenous fistula and Z0 (23 +/- 9 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasonography was used prospectively in the initial evaluation of 198 patients with 319 potential vascular injuries of the neck and extremities. Patients who were unstable or who had obvious arterial trauma were excluded. Injury was caused by gunshot in 104 (53%), blunt trauma in 42 (21%), stab wound in 34 (17%), and shotgun in 18 (9%). Duplex ultrasonography correctly characterized and localized vascular injuries in 23 patients: arterial disruptions (13), intimal flaps (4), acute pseudoaneurysms (3), arteriovenous fistulas (2), and shotgun pellet arteriopuncture (1). Nineteen other patients had vasospasm (13) or external compression (6) without evidence of intrinsic vessel injury, these 42 studies had true-positive results. Twenty patients underwent arterial repair (13 on the basis of duplex ultrasonography alone), one had primary amputation, three required fasciotomy, and 18 were observed. Two patients with false-negative results had minor shotgun pellet arteriopunctures that were missed by duplex ultrasonography, but neither needed repair. One hundred fifty-three patients had true-negative results on duplex ultrasonography: all clinically had only proximity injuries and easily palpable distal pulses. The result of one duplex ultrasonography study was found to be false-positive on arteriography. The sensitivity of duplex ultrasonography was 95%, the specificity was 99%, and the overall accuracy was 98%. These results closely approximate those reported with the use of exclusion arteriography in the evaluation of similar vascular trauma patients. Furthermore, duplex ultrasonography has no interventional risks and is more cost-effective for screening such injuries than arteriography or exploration. Duplex ultrasonography is a reliable method of diagnosis in patients with potential peripheral vascular injuries.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has not been well defined, particularly when discovered in conjunction with aortic disease requiring correction. To better define the natural history of such lesions, 194 sequential aortograms in 48 patients were studied to define predictive criteria for stenoses at risk for progression. Sixty-six unsuspected atherosclerotic renal arterial stenoses were identified on the initial aortograms. Disease progressed in 42 arteries (53%), 14 bilateral and 28 unilateral. Seven arteries developed occlusion. All had stenoses averaging 80% (range 61% to 94%) noted on the most recent aortogram preceding occlusion. Risk factors including smoking, diabetes mellitus, elevated serum lipids, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or change in blood pressure or creatinine, did not correlate with degree or rate of progression of the renal artery stenosis. A difference in kidney size, although varying inversely with degree of stenosis, was not a statistically significant marker of disease progression. This analysis suggests that identification of renal arterial stenoses that will progress is best determined by sequential aortography. Highly stenotic vessels are more prone to occlude than those less stenotic. Consequently, individuals with preocclusive lesions should benefit from prophylactic renal revascularization during aortic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "A vascular rehabilitation program was designed to increase exercise tolerance and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. Sixty-eight patients (32 men, 36 women); ages 55 to 85 years (mean, 68 years) with claudication 30 (44%), or recovering from lower extremity revascularization 36 (53%), or endovascular procedures 2 (3%) entered the vascular rehabilitation program. Each underwent a physical examination, risk factor assessment, noninvasive arterial studies, and cardiac evaluation. A history was taken from each patient also. Six patients (9%) were excluded on recognition of silent myocardial ischemia. Sixty-two patients (91%) were accepted for exercise training in a program designed to offer 24 (1-hour) monitored exercise sessions, 12 (1-hour) personalized education lectures, and development of a home maintenance exercise program. No deaths or major morbidity occurred. Seventeen patients (27%) did not finish the program, eight (13%) because of development of significant cardiac, extremity, or cerebrovascular disease and nine for nonmedical reasons. Of the 45 patients (73%) who completed the program, 38 (88%) had documented increases in walking distances of greater than 100% (122% to 450%). All 45 patients designed home exercise programs, and 88% of the smokers quit. Long-term follow-up was available on 100% of the patients. Thirty-eight patients (84%) have been followed for 2 years or more. Thirty-eight (84%) maintained or improved walking distances recorded on exit from the program. Thirty of the 36 patients (83%) who stopped smoking remained nonsmokers. Significant reductions in cholesterol were seen at 1 year, and significant reductions in triglycerides were seen at 12 weeks and 1 year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Twenty-two iatrogenic vascular injuries caused by resection of tumors with local recurrences or adjuvant chemotherapy were treated over a 42-month period in 11 female and 8 male patients with cancer (58% had documented metastases). Sixteen of 22 vascular injuries were caused by intraarterial administration of chemotherapy (8 emboli; 8 direct catheter trauma), and six were caused by resection of tumors with local invasion. The injuries were extremity ischemia (15 extremities in 13 patients), pseudoaneurysm (4), expanding hematoma (3 injuries in 2 patients). Twenty-two surgical repairs included bypass of severely damaged arteries in five, embolectomy in five, interposition grafts in three, pseudoaneurysm resection and primary repair in three, primary repair of three vascular injuries, and one patch angioplasty. Leg amputation was required in two patients. Seventeen of 19 patients had successful vascular repairs with resolution of preoperative indications for vascular repair without intraoperative or postoperative deaths. Long term follow-up (mean, 17 months) showed no recurrence of vascular problems; however, two patients died of metastatic cancer at 6 and 24 weeks after vascular repair. This study supports an aggressive approach to the management of vascular injuries caused by therapeutic interventions for malignancy despite the presence of metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "One hundred thirty-seven limbs with venous obstruction were analyzed. The arm/foot venous pressure differential and reactive hyperemia tests were found to be useful techniques to diagnose and grade venous obstruction. Traditional techniques including venography and ambulatory venous pressure are inferior in this regard. The newer techniques have provided newer insights in venous obstruction which are detailed herein. The hand-held Doppler was surprisingly very sensitive in grade I as well as in more severe forms of obstruction. Neither anatomic locale of obstruction nor its extent determined hemodynamic severity. Extensive proximal lesions could be hemodynamically mild, and conversely distal crural obstructions and single segment lesions could be hemodynamically severe. Phlebographic appearance was a poor index of collateralization. The paradoxical venous pressure response to the reactive hyperemia test in grade IV obstruction was found to be due to suppression or delay of the reactive hyperemia response itself in the presence of severe venous obstruction. The pain of venous claudication may be related to this phenomenon. Skin ulceration in the presence of venous obstruction was related to the associated reflux rather than the hemodynamic severity of the obstruction itself. The Linton procedure was found to be useful in treating such skin ulcerations. After perforator disruption, obstruction did not become hemodynamically worse, but reflux as measured by the Valsalva test improved with ulcer healing. The improvement in reflux related to Valsalva offers for the first time a hemodynamic rationale for the Linton procedure.",

    "abstract": "Since the natural history of specific superficial femoral artery stenoses is not known, we examined progression rates of superficial femoral artery stenoses in 45 lower extremities found when arteriograms were obtained of 38 patients for symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the opposite leg or abdomen. These initial superficial femoral artery arteriograms were compared with later arteriograms in 25 limbs, duplex scans in 27 limbs, and both modalities in 7 limbs. After a mean interval of 37 months, most superficial femoral artery stenoses (72%) did not progress. However, 12 superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed (28%; mean follow-up, 37 months, including 7 that occluded (17%). Superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed among patients who complained of symptom progression at a rate faster than that among asymptomatic patients (15.6%/year vs 3%/year; p = 0.006). Superficial femoral artery lesions also progressed more rapidly among patients whose contralateral superficial femoral artery was occluded (10%/year vs 1.6%/year; p = 0.04). By multivariate regression analysis, symptom progression and smoking history were predictive of superficial femoral artery stenosis progression. In the seven patients whose superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed to occlusion, the average rate of stenosis progression was 12%/year (maximum predicted rate, 30% per year by 95% confidence limit). These results indicate that superficial femoral artery stenoses usually progress with synchronous symptomatic deterioration. Other than symptom progression, only cumulative smoking history and contralateral superficial femoral artery occlusion could be associated with superficial femoral artery stenosis progression in this small series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are widely regarded to be of questionable value. This has prompted some to abandon all attempts at secondary revascularization with PTFE and others to recommend that primary femoropopliteal bypasses be performed preferentially with PTFE grafts so that vein may be used for secondary procedures. Because we questioned both of these views, we reviewed all femoropopliteal bypasses done at our institution in the past 12 years and identified 73 secondary PTFE femoropopliteal procedures performed after a failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass (69 failed femoropopliteal; 4 failed femorodistal). Seventy (96%) secondary bypasses were performed for limb salvage and 3 (4%) for severe disabling claudication. Insertion of grafts to the popliteal artery was above the knee in 26 (36%) and below the knee in 47 (64%). Primary life-table graft patency at 4 years was only 38%. Forty-eight reinterventions in 34 limbs were required to restore or maintain graft patency in thrombosed or failing grafts. For thrombosed grafts, 20 interventions consisted of 9 simple thrombectomies and 11 thrombectomies with additional revision procedures (5 distal or proximal extensions, 6 patch angioplasties). Twenty-eight lesions threatening graft patency were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3, proximal or distal extensions in 20, and patch angioplasty in 5. As a result of these reinterventions, the overall secondary patency rate was 55% at 4 years, and the limb salvage rate was 74% at 4 years. Although aggressive follow-up and reintervention may be required, the use of secondary PTFE conduits in the femoropopliteal position is a viable option in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures who are at high risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "From June 1960 to September 1990, 1414 patients underwent repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 112 (8%) had pulmonary complications requiring respiratory support with tracheostomy; subsequently 45 (40%) died in the hospital. We determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis, in a prospective study of high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms repairs, the independent predictors of respiratory failure, defined as respiratory ventilation exceeding 48 hours after operation. In 98 patients studied, 38 (39%) were women, 60 (61%) were men, 54 (55%) had type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 34 (35%) had aortic dissection, 19 (19%) were nonsmokers, 40 (41%) exsmokers, and 39 (40%) active smokers. Before operation, 55 (56%) had chronic pulmonary disease with respiratory failure developing in 58% (p = 0.0005 versus no chronic pulmonary disease, 10/43, 23%), and of the 26 patients in the lower quarter of forced expiratory volume (1 sec) (FEV1 less than or equal to 1.45 L) respiratory failure developed in 61% (p = 0.035). In-hospital survival was 98% and 83% (p = 0.008), respectively, and cumulative survival at 6 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 96% and 80% (p = 0.004, log-rank test), respectively, for patients without respiratory failure (N = 56/98, 57%) and with respiratory failure (N = 42/98, 43%). On univariate analysis, the following were associated with respiratory failure (p less than 0.05): FEV1, FEV1% predicted, FVC, FEF25, FEF25% predicted, FEF25-75, FEF25-75% predicted, PaCO2 Pao2, symptoms, smoking history, chronic pulmonary disease, cryoprecipitate volume, postoperative neuromuscular deficit, cardiac complications, reoperation for bleeding, renal complication, stress ulceration, postoperative creatinine level, postoperative dialysis, and postoperative encephalopathy. The independent predictors of respiratory failure were (p less than 0.05): chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, cardiac and renal complications. In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the only independent predictor was FEF25 (p = 0.030). These observations may be of value in selecting patients for elective operation.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the degree and location of vessel wall geometric changes after carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction. The external diameters of the proximal common carotid, common carotid bulb, and internal carotid arteries were measured during operation with a caliper after 349 carotid endarterectomies. There were 309 saphenous vein reconstructions, 31 synthetic patch reconstructions, and 9 primary closures. One or more B-mode ultrasound studies with cross-sectional views for common and internal carotid cursor measurements were performed from 3 months to 5 years after operation. The intraoperative-to-postoperative common carotid diameters were unchanged for the three types of reconstructions. The internal carotid diameters increased 20% to 30% for both the vein and synthetic patched arteries. This dilation was present at 3 and 6 months and progressed slightly over 5 years. Wall thickening greater than or equal to 1 mm was present in 62% of the carotid endarterectomies, with concentric stenosis in 3% and eccentric stenosis in 59%. Eccentric stenosis was present at 3 to 6 months, located on the endarterectomized posterior-medial wall of the common and internal carotid arteries, was always less than 50%, and changed very little over 5 years. No aneurysms or internal carotid occlusions were identified. Carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction results in early, mild, nonaneurysmal dilation of the internal carotid patched segment, frequent mild eccentric restenosis, and rare hemodynamically significant concentric restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Initial efforts to modify the stainless steel Greenfield filter for percutaneous insertion led to development of a titanium Greenfield filter, which could be inserted by use of a 12F carrier. This device functioned well as a filter but had an unacceptable 30% rate of migration, tilting, and penetration. Therefore a titanium Greenfield filter with modified hooks was developed and has been tested in 186 patients at 10 institutions. Successful placement occurred in 181 (97%); placement of the remainder was precluded by unfavorable anatomy. A contraindication to anticoagulation was the most frequent indication for insertion (75%). All but two were inserted percutaneously, predominantly via the right femoral vein (70%). Initial incomplete opening was seen in four patients (2%), which was corrected by guide wire manipulation and asymmetry of the legs in 10 (5.4%). Insertion site hematoma occurred in one patient, and apical penetration of the cava during insertion occurred in a second patient. Both events were without sequelae. Follow-up examinations were performed at 30 days at which time 35 deaths had occurred. Recurrent embolism was suspected in six patients (3%) and two of three deaths were confirmed by autopsy. Filter movement greater than 9 mm was seen in 13 patients, (11%) and increase in base diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm was seen in 17 patients (14%). CT scanning showed evidence of caval penetration in only one patient (0.8%). Insertion site venous thrombosis was seen in 4/46 (8.7%) patients screened. The modified hook titanium Greenfield filter is inserted percutaneously or operatively through a sheath, eliminating concern for misplacement from premature discharge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience with 54 patients who underwent innominate artery revascularization during a 10-year period. Their age range was from 16 to 75 years (mean, 49.8 years). The innominate artery alone was involved in 21 patients (39%); the remaining patients had additional arch vessel obstructions. Before operation, neurologic symptoms occurred in 25 patients (46%), arm ischemia related to claudication and microembolization occurred in 8 patients (14%), a combination of symptoms occurred in 17 patients (32%), and no symptoms were noted in 4 patients (8%). The extrathoracic approach to surgery was used in 16 patients (30%). Eleven of the 38 patients in whom the intrathoracic approach was used had endarterectomy of the innominate artery; in three of those, the procedure was combined with left common carotid endarterectomy. Bypass grafts were used in the other 27 patients undergoing procedures with an intrathoracic approach; in six of those, bypass was combined with carotid endarterectomy. No operative deaths occurred. Perioperative revascularization failure occurred in four cases; all of those patients underwent a second revascularization procedure, with a secondary patency rate of 100%. In four patients, late occlusion was noted at 6 months and at 1, 1.5, and 10 years. One patient had a permanent perioperative neurologic deficit in the distribution of the left carotid artery after a combined common carotid endarterectomy/innominate endarterectomy procedure. No neurologic deficits were directly related to the innominate artery territory. Long-term actuarial survival was 83% at 10 years. Early and late graft failures were related to inadequate inflow in bypass grafts, progression of distal disease in arteritis, and primary closure in endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Vein graft stenosis remains an important contributing factor to the failure of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. Repair of these lesions before graft occlusion provides sustained patency, yet the optimal method of repair has not been established. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of these vein graft lesions has been repeatedly advocated as an alternative to surgical revision. Balloon angioplasty was used in 30 patients with 54 stenotic lesions occurring in autogenous vein grafts after infrainguinal reconstruction. The primary 5-year cumulative patency rate was 18% overall, with no significant differences observed among patency rates based on initial indication, length of stenotic lesion, or requirement for preliminary thrombolytic therapy. The 3-year patency rate associated with vein graft lesions requiring only a single angioplasty proved significantly higher (59%) than those requiring repetitive dilations (6%). It is our conclusion that balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis has significant limitations in providing sustained secondary patency.",

    "abstract": "Favorable early results with mechanical angioplasty devices and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty have resulted in aggressive marketing and a rapid increase in the use of these devices for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease. Recent reports, however, have questioned the durability of these less invasive procedures. Since 1986 we have been involved in the clinical investigation of the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. One hundred two balloon angioplasty procedures assisted by the Nd:YAG laser (n = 56) and the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument (n = 46) were performed for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. Both Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty groups were similar with regard to age, operative indication, preoperative ankle-brachial index, lesion length, and distal runoff. Mean follow-up was 19 months in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 15 months in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. Technically successful recanalization was achieved in 67% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 82% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Early hemodynamic and clinical improvement was obtained in 59% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 57% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Two-year clinical success by life-table analysis was 37% in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 19% in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. The level of subsequent surgical revascularization was not altered in any patient by Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty or laser-assisted balloon angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Over the last 5 years an extended left flank retroperitoneal approach was used in 85 of 531 (16%) aortic reconstructions deemed technically complex. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed in 70 patients (82%), bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease was performed in 11 (13%), and aortic endarterectomy for mesenteric and/or renovascular disease was performed in 4 (5%). Indications for use of this approach included a \"hostile\" abdomen (43 patients), juxta/suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (35), large (greater than 10 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (12), extreme obesity (10), associated renal and/or visceral artery stenosis requiring endarterectomy (9), inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (2), and horseshoe kidney (2). Suprarenal or supraceliac aortic clamping, averaging 31 minutes, was required in 43 patients (50%). Postoperative recovery was rapid (average length of stay, 10.2 days), and morbidity was minimal despite the complex nature of these reconstructions. The perioperative mortality rate in elective operations was 1.2%. This approach facilitated proximal abdominal aortic exposure and anastomosis, especially in large, pararenal aneurysms or in situations unfavorable to a transabdominal approach. Whereas a left flank retroperitoneal approach can be used in most aortic reconstructions, it seems especially suited to those that pose significant technical challenges.",

    "abstract": "Three hundred eighty-two patients with active leg ulcers were clinically examined after random selection out of a population of 827 patients identified within a previous cross-sectional population survey. Bidirectional Doppler ultrasonography was used for objective assessment of arterial and venous circulation. The purpose was to register causative factors and the etiologic spectrum. Venous insufficiency was present in 332 (72%) of 463 legs with active ulceration; deep insufficiency occurred in 176 (38%), and purely superficial insufficiency was present in 156 (34%). Ankle/brachial index was 0.9 or less in 185 (40%) of ulcerated legs. Venous insufficiency was the dominating causative factor in 250 legs (54%), of which 60% was the result of deep venous insufficiency. Arterial insufficiency was judged to be the possible dominating factor in 12%, and 6% showed clearly ischemic ulcers. Mixed ulcers with combined arterial and venous insufficiency were found to be common as were patients with diabetes and arterial impairment. In 10% of the legs a multifactorial origin was present, and in 10% no venous or arterial impairment was detectable. Thus after classification of causes 40% of all ulcerated legs showed potentially surgically curable circulatory disturbances. It is necessary to objectively assess all patients with chronic leg ulcers to be able to detect patients with potentially surgically curable disease.",

    "abstract": "Expansion rate and incidence of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms in relation to their size is a source of debate. We studied 114 patients (out of a cohort of 752 consecutive patients admitted with abdominal aortic aneurysms) who were denied any immediate operation because of patient's refusal, high surgical risk, or small transverse diameter as assessed by CT scanning and ultrasonography. All patients not operated on underwent from two to six repeated examinations during an average follow-up period of 26.8 months (range, 3 to 132). Forty-seven patients (41.2%) were subsequently operated on electively because of marked increase of transverse diameter of the aneurysm (n = 44) or for other reasons (n = 3), with a death rate of 0%. Eighteen other patients underwent emergency operation for leaking or ruptured aneurysms, and there were five deaths. The incidence of rupture was clearly related to the final diameter value, rising from 0% in aneurysms less than 40 mm to 22% in large size aneurysms (greater than or equal to 50 mm). Among the 49 patients not operated on, one died of rupture before operation and five of causes unrelated to the disease. Using individual serial measurements, we determined the linear expansion rate of the aneurysm, which proved to be related to initial diameter values: 5.3 mm/year for diameters less than 40 mm (n = 49), 6.9 mm/year in the 40 to 49 mm group (n = 41), and 7.4 mm/year for diameters of 50 mm or more (n = 24).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Closure of a major proximal venous collateral vessel eliminated the steal and resulted in SaO2 correction and was followed by clinical amelioration. Pulse oximetry proved to be a helpful adjunct in the evaluation of the painful hand after creation of an arteriovenous fistula. By applying the pulse oximeter to the patient's affected limb, we were able to determine whether the pain was a result of ischemia and if the correction of the steal improved oxygenation.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that topically applied platelet-derived wound healing factors (PDWHF) accelerate wound healing by stimulating angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis. To assess the ability of platelet factors to facilitate healing of chronic cutaneous ulcers we performed a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of topical PDWHF in 18 patients with 26 lower extremity wounds refractory to conventional therapy. Wounds were present for at least 8 weeks (mean, 5.5 +/- 4.3 months). They were extensively debrided initially and were measured and photographed at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. Eight patients with nine wounds were treated with placebo solution (controls), and 10 patients with 17 wounds were treated with PDWHF (treatment group). Seventy-eight percent of patients had diabetes mellitus, 72% had occlusive peripheral vascular disease, and 28% had venous disease; distribution of these disorders was equivalent in both groups. Ankle-brachial indexes, which were often spuriously elevated, averaged 0.93 +/- 0.54 in controls and 1.04 +/- 0.56 in patients treated with PDWHF (p greater than 0.5). Mean transcutaneous oxygen tension was 37.8 +/- 11.9 mmHg in controls and 37.1 +/- 9.1 mmHg in patients treated with PDWHF. Initial wound area was larger in controls than in the patients treated with PDWHF (28.9 +/- 45.2 cm2 vs 13.0 +/- 4.4 cm2), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Three (33%) wounds (in two patients) healed in controls, and four (24%) wounds (in three patients) healed in the PDWHF group (p greater than 0.5). The rate of healing in controls was 1.9 +/- 2.7 cm2/week.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric artery duplex scanning appears promising for detection of splanchnic artery stenosis or occlusion or both in patients with symptoms suggestive of chronic intestinal ischemia. However, no specific duplex criteria have been developed for detection of mesenteric artery stenosis. We obtained mesenteric artery duplex scans and infradiaphragmatic lateral aortograms in 34 patients to determine duplex criteria for mesenteric stenosis. Seventy percent or greater angiographic stenosis was present in 10 superior mesenteric arteries and 16 celiac arteries. Duplex scans were reviewed to determine if celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery ratios of peak systolic velocities and end-diastolic velocities to peak aortic systolic velocity, as well as celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery peak systolic velocities and end-diastolic velocities alone, could predict a greater than or equal to 70% angiographic stenosis or occlusion or both. The results obtained by use of receiver operator curves indicated peak systolic velocity alone was an accurate predictor of splanchnic artery stenosis. Specifically, a peak systolic velocity greater than or equal to 275 cm/sec in the superior mesenteric artery and greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec in the celiac artery or no flow signal (superior mesenteric artery and celiac artery) predicted a 70% to 100% stenosis with sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 89%, 92%, and 80% for the superior mesenteric artery. Similar values for the celiac artery were 75%, 89%, and 85%, respectively. End-diastolic velocities or calculated velocity ratios conveyed no additional accuracy in predicting splanchnic artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "A color real-time duplex scanner was used to scan the greater saphenous vein in 89 limbs of 55 patients to study the efficacy of prior greater saphenous vein sclerotherapy. The greater saphenous vein was insonated from the saphenofemoral junction to the knee to evaluate both reflux to a standardized 30 mm Hg Valsalva maneuver and evidence of greater saphenous vein obliteration by sclerotherapy. These data were correlated with the number of sclerosing injections used (mean, 1.8; range, 1 to 6), time from the last injection (mean, 27.5 mo.; range, 3 to 55 mo), and concentration of injectant used (0.5% to 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate). Fifty-one of 89 injected limbs (57%) demonstrated reflux through the saphenofemoral junction, and reflux down the more distal greater saphenous vein was found in 67 of 89 injected limbs (75%). Greater saphenous vein obliteration was noted in only 18 of 89 injected limbs (20%); two were totally obliterated, and 16 were partially obliterated. The greater saphenous vein was obliterated in 6% below a refluxing saphenofemoral junction and in 40% below a nonrefluxing junction. A greater saphenous vein obliteration rate of 9% was found with a refluxing greater saphenous vein, and 50% in a nonrefluxing greater saphenous vein. Femoral vein reflux was identified in 11 of the 110 limbs (10%) and in every case was associated with both saphenofemoral junction and greater saphenous vein reflux. We noted a trend toward more successful results with more concentrated injectate (3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate). Fifty percent of patients reported improvement in symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the in vivo correlation of intravascular ultrasonography and uniplanar angiography in determining the luminal dimensions of normal and moderately atherosclerotic human arteries. Five French and 8F rotating A scan intravascular ultrasound catheters were used to obtain 48 images in four superficial femoral arteries, five iliac arteries, and one aorta in eight patients undergoing vascular surgery. Cross-sectional areas measured by intravascular ultrasonography were compared to cross-sectional areas calculated by uniplanar angiography of the same location in the vessel. Maximum and minimum luminal diameters were also measured from intravascular ultrasound images. An ellipticity index was defined as the maximum/minimum diameter ratio (max/min) and ranged from 1.0 to 1.8 (mean, 1.2). Comparison of the cross-sectional areas measured from intravascular ultrasound images and those calculated from uniplanar angiography showed no significant difference at any level of ellipticity studied. However, when the values of cross-sectional areas were analyzed in groups corresponding to the diameter of the vessel, that is, aortic, iliac, and femoral, the values for the iliac arteries calculated from uniplanar angiography were significantly greater by 9.8% +/- 0.7% (n = 29, p = 0.03) when compared to those measured by intravascular ultrasonography. In addition to providing accurate luminal determinations, intravascular ultrasound images displayed transmural morphology, the location and character of the atherosclerotic lesions, and the thickness of the vessel wall. We conclude that intravascular ultrasound imaging provides accurate, novel information regarding human vessels and that this technology may play a significant role in future diagnostic and interventional therapies.",

    "abstract": "It is important for vascular surgeons to be familiar with reflex sympathetic dystrophy because they may be called on to participate in the evaluation and treatment of patients with this syndrome. Over a 3 1/2-year period, 35 patients, initially evaluated by a team of pain experts, were referred for surgical sympathectomy for reflex sympathetic dystrophy. All patients had at least one positive diagnostic sympathetic block before they were considered for surgical sympathectomy. With use of this team approach and careful patient selection, excellent results were obtained in 74%, good results in 17%, and poor results in 9%. Three patients required a repeat cervical sympathectomy after initial surgery failed to relieve their symptoms. One patient required a contralateral lumbar sympathectomy after ipsilateral sympathectomy was unsuccessful. Better results were obtained in patients treated earlier in their course and with extended surgical sympathectomy. Patients not responding to initial sympathectomy should be evaluated for the presence of residual functional sympathetic tissue, and if this is identified, further sympathectomy by an alternate approach appears justified.",

    "abstract": "Embolic phenomena in patients with infective endocarditis may complicate the placement of a cardiac valvular prosthesis. To evaluate the vascular consequences of these emboli, a 15-year review of 102 patients undergoing valve replacement for proven infective endocarditis was undertaken. Thirty-one patients with 36 episodes of septic embolization were identified. Ten of these were separate extremity occlusive events. All patients with extremity emboli were admitted with pain; four had limb-threatening emboli. All patients grew gram-positive bacteria from their blood except a single Candida albicans isolate. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was used in all patients. Angiography confirmed the diagnosis in 11 of 12 patients. Embolic targets included the lower extremities in all except a single instance. Four patients had multiple emboli. All but one of the vascular procedures were carried out subsequent to or simultaneously with cardiac valve replacement. Initial operative management included embolectomy (4) and primary amputation (2). Two delayed procedures were required. One patient died. Four patients had limited ischemia that resolved with antibiotics and anticoagulation. This report suggests that infective endocarditis requiring valvular replacement is associated with embolization in one third of patients. The presentation of peripheral vascular emboli is that of acute extremity ischemia. The diagnosis should be confirmed by angiography to rule out the possibility of multiple emboli. When possible, valve replacement should precede peripheral vascular management, which may include operative or medical components as dictated by the extent of limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous renal artery dissection is an uncommon cause of renovascular hypertension, usually associated with fibromuscular dysplasia. Among reported nonautopsy cases (N = 80), arterial reconstruction has seldom been attempted (N = 21) and the outcome has frequently been poor (48% clinical failure rate). This is attributed in part to the frequent involvement of renal artery branches by the dissection. Furthermore, the report of spontaneous reversion to normotension among patients treated medically has also clouded the role of surgery in this disease. Since progress in the technique of renal artery repair now allows successful treatment of anatomically complex lesions, we reviewed our experience with arterial reconstruction in the management of spontaneous renal artery dissection to determine the frequency of and factors correlating with cure after operative repair. Ten patients (eight men, two women; mean age, 39.3 +/- 5.9 years) were admitted with severe hypertension (10/10), often associated with neurologic symptoms, hematuria, or flank pain (8/10). Serum creatinine was elevated in only two patients. Angiography demonstrated changes consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia in 7 of 10 patients and evidence of dissection in 6 of 10. Bilateral disease was present in three patients. Only five patients had a single renal artery on the involved side. The dissection extended into the primary branches in 8 of 10 patients and involved both renal arteries in four of the five patients with two arteries. Histologic study confirmed fibromuscular dysplasia in six and intramural dissection in all operative specimens. Five patients underwent revascularization (in one case requiring the ex vivo technique), with use of hypogastric artery as a conduit in four of five or resection and primary reanastomosis in one of five. Three patients became normotensive, and two returned to their previous level of blood pressure control. Follow-up averaged 14.5 years. Two patients underwent nephrectomy after exploration demonstrated nonreconstructible vessels, and two underwent nephrectomy when intraoperative assessment of the kidney showed that revascularization had failed to adequately reverse extensive renal ischemia. After a mean follow-up of 14.6 years these patients remain normotensive, although two require antihypertensive medications. One patient was treated medically and is currently hypertensive off all medications. Nine of 10 patients have maintained a normal serum creatinine during follow-up. We conclude that renal revascularization is frequently successful in spontaneous renal artery dissection (five of seven, 71.4%) and results in sustained relief of hypertension with maximal conservation of renal tissue. This is important because of the young age at onset and the not infrequent occurrence of bilateral fibromuscular dysplasia, and even of dissection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In the past 3 years at our institution 130 patients have undergone cardiac transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy in 49 (38%), idiopathic cardiomyopathy in 42 (32%), viral cardiomyopathy in 9 (6.9%), pulmonary hypertension in 8 (6%), and graft atherosclerosis in 2 (1.5%). Routine preoperative abdominal ultrasonography was performed on 98 (75%) of these patients with specific visualization of the abdominal aorta in 93 (95%). Abdominal aortic aneurysms (all infrarenal) were found before operation in four patients and only in the subgroup undergoing transplantation for ischemic heart disease (10.5%). They measured 3.4, 4.5, 3.6, and 3.8 cm before transplantation. Periodic evaluation by ultrasonography was carried out after transplantation during the 3-year period of this study. One aneurysm that was initially 3.6 cm increased to 4.0 cm and ruptured 2 months after transplantation. The patient died despite emergent surgery. Aneurysms in three patients who demonstrated rapid aneurysm expansion after transplantation were successfully repaired at 5, 20, and 33 months after transplantation when the lesions reached 5.5, 5.9, and 4.8 cm. A fifth patient with an initially normal (1.5 cm) aorta developed a symptomatic aneurysm of 4.1 cm, which was repaired uneventfully. The average expansion rate of these aneurysms after transplantation was 0.74 +/- 0.15 cm/year. This experience suggests that aneurysms are limited to patients undergoing transplantation for ischemic heart disease. Ultrasound examination may be appropriate for preoperative screening. Careful aortic surveillance after transplantation is important in patients having transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy because of the apparent rapid expansion rate compared to aneurysms in the population not receiving transplants.",

    "abstract": "The long-term integrity of an autogenous vascular anastomosis is primarily dependent on the strength of tissue healing; therefore permanent mechanical support of an autogenous anastomosis with sutures is unnecessary. In this study we evaluated monofilament absorbable polydioxanone as an alternative to polypropylene for suturing autogenous vascular tissue during adult peripheral vascular operations. We used polydioxanone suture for 21 vascular procedures in 20 patients. We evaluated suture handling characteristics during operation and then followed patients with clinical assessments and serial duplex scans to monitor for pseudoaneurysms, anastomotic narrowing, and vessel patency. Indications for surgery included limb salvage (67%), dialysis access (23%), traumatic arteriovenous fistula and claudication (5% each). The operative procedures included infrainguinal bypass (57%), arteriovenous fistula formation (24%), thromboembolectomy (14%), and arteriovenous fistula repair (5%). Polydioxanone sutures were placed in 39 separate test sites (35 arterial, 4 venous). No deaths occurred during operation. Polydioxanone suture was found to have handling characteristics similar to polypropylene. During mean patient follow-up of 7.2 +/- 0.6 months, we found no cases of anastomotic narrowing or pseudoaneurysms. Actuarial test site patency at 1, 3, and 6 months was 97%, 97%, and 86%, respectively. Polydioxanone suture has handling properties that are acceptable for use in vascular applications, and it provides adequate mechanical support for sutured vessels to heal. A randomized trial comparing polydioxanone with polypropylene suture will be necessary to determine whether the lack of permanent foreign material in vascular anastomoses can improve long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "Lack of an endothelial surface is most often blamed for the relatively poor patency of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts used in infrageniculate bypass when compared to autogenous saphenous vein. Length, caliber, flow, and ability to withstand flexion are also acknowledged but have not been systematically examined. We report the results of our attempts to discriminate between the relative contributions of these factors and to develop a suitable canine model for evaluating small-caliber prostheses (4 mm x 10 cm thin-walled polytetrafluoroethylene). ASA/dipyridamole were given 1 week before and 4 weeks after operation. Patency was assessed by directional Doppler at frequent intervals (less than or equal to 3 days). The following were observed: (1) Iliac placement provided a useful patency reference point (40% to 50% patency at 60 days). (2) Carotid patency was not better than iliac patency. (3) Crossing a flexion crease decreased patency. (4) The low patencies were not technical but intrinsic to the graft. Iliofemoral vein grafts achieved 100% patency at 60 days. (5) External rings did not improve iliofemoral patency (equal in paired comparisons). (6) Neither baseline platelet aggregation nor platelet aggregation after ASA administration correlated with patency. This canine model is an excellent test for small caliber-low flow prostheses. It allows paired-site comparisons, which are essential, and meaningful patency data with reasonable numbers of subjects within 2 months' observation. Directional Doppler evaluation avoids need for angiography or serial postmortem analysis sacrifice.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of bonding rifampin to double-velour Dacron grafts with collagen to prevent graft sepsis. Fifty 6.0 mm Dacron grafts (length 5.0 cm) impregnated with either collagen (control) or collagen plus rifampin (experimental) were implanted in dogs end-to-end into the infrarenal aorta. The dogs were divided into four groups (each with an experimental and control subdivision) as a function of time between grafting and bacterial challenge. At 2, 7, 10, or 12 days after graft implantation, sequential groups were challenged with 1.2 x 10(8) colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolate) intravenously suspended in 250 ml normal saline. Three weeks after hematogenous seeding, the grafts were sterilely harvested. One-tailed Fisher's exact test was used to compare the patency and culture-proven infection of control and antibiotic coated grafts as a function of implantation time before bacteremic challenge. In the 2-day group, four of six control grafts were infected compared with zero of six experimental grafts (p less than 0.030). In the 7-day group, five of six control grafts were infected with S. aureus versus zero of six in the experimental group (p less than 0.008). In the 10-day group, one of six experimental grafts was infected, but the control group had only two of six graft infections. In the 12-day group two of six experimental grafts and one of five control grafts were infected. These results indicate that rifampin bonded with collagen to knitted Dacron grafts will protect the graft from bacteremic infection for 7 days after implantation in a highly challenging model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Derivatives of arachidonic acid have been found to play a role in the reperfusion injury of various tissues. These compounds have a broad spectrum of activity, including modulation of white blood cell response to injured tissue. This study was designed to determine the effect of thromboxane and lipoxygenase derivatives on the local and systemic response to ischemia and reperfusion of skeletal muscle. Fifteen dogs were separated into three groups and subjected to gracilis muscle ischemia followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. One group served as controls, one group was treated with OKY-046 (a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor), and one group was treated with diethylcarbamazine (a lipoxygenase inhibitor). White blood cell activation as measured by superoxide anion production, and eicosanoid levels were measured both in the gracilis venous effluent and central venous circulation. These results were compared to infarct size in the gracilis muscle. OKY-046 significantly reduced thromboxane production in both the central venous (102 +/- 30 to 31 +/- 9 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) and gracilis samples (107 +/- 22 to 25 +/- 6 pg/ml, p less than 0.005). This was accompanied by a reduced white cell activation in the central venous blood (15 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 1 nmol O2-, p less than 0.05), but did not affect infarct size or white cell activation in the gracilis. Conversely, diethylcarbamazine significantly reduced both white cell activation (16 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 1 nmol O2-, p less than 0.005) and infarct size in the gracilis muscles (61.6% +/- 4.5% to 28.5% +/- 8.6%, p less than 0.01), as well as reduced systemic white blood cell activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is a rare and potentially curable tumor. Uncertainty about the results of treatment derives from lack of a large series in the same center and of a long-term follow-up of the published cases. A review of the world literature from 1871 to 1989 allowed us to collect information on 141 patients with inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma to which our three cases have to be added. The tumor arose from the lower segment of the inferior vena cava (infrarenal portion) in 49 patients, from the middle segment (from the renal veins to the hepatic veins) in 59, and from the upper segment (from the hepatic veins to the right atrium) in 34 patients. Complete clinical, pathologic, and therapeutic data and up-to-date follow-up have been obtained through personal correspondence with several authors. All data have been examined with both univariate and multivariate analyses as predictive factors for outcome. Variables, associated with an increased risk of death from disease, included the involvement of inferior vena cava upper segment and a high-grade tumor. Patients who underwent a radical resection of the tumor (82 patients, 56.9%) had a significantly better survival (27.9% and 14.2%, 5- and 10-year survival rates, respectively). Of these patients, those with tumor of the inferior vena cava middle segment fared better than those with lower segment tumor (5- and 10-year survival rates were 48.3% and 34.4%, respectively, for middle segment tumor and 9.3% and 0.0% for lower segment tumor). Variables associated with a good outcome and longer survival were the presence of abdominal pain and the absence of a palpable abdominal mass. Despite the high rate of recurrence (52.4% of patients undergoing radical operation; median time, 25 months), radical resection of inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma is the only chance for a long-term cure. An earlier and more accurate preoperative diagnosis, by means of modern diagnostic techniques (echography, CT scanning, magnetic resonance imaging) will allow a higher rate of radical resection to be performed with an increase in patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Umbilical artery catheterization is known to be associated with aortoiliac thrombosis in approximately 1% of newborns in whom catheters are placed. We describe a case of catheter-associated aortoiliac thrombosis in a newborn who was successfully treated by urokinase infusion. The infant was monitored by imaging studies followed by ultrasonography. The use of real-time ultrasonography enabled us to image this infant's aortoiliac thrombosis in an accurate, noninvasive manner and monitor the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy. The fibrinolytic state was achieved with a combination of intravenous and intraarterial infusions of urokinase. Frequent measurement of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and thrombin time was used to guide fibrinolytic therapy. We reviewed the literature for similar cases of aortoiliac thrombosis in newborns; some were managed by medical means, others by operation. The success rate of the two approaches appeared to be approximately equal. Therefore we recommend the less invasive approach first--urokinase therapy--to be followed by surgical intervention if thrombolysis is unsuccessful.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and phlebographic evidence exists that correlates the presence of varices of the vulva, posterior thigh, and the pelvic congestion syndrome with insufficiency of the internal iliac venous system (pelvic dumping syndrome). Information in the modern medical literature regarding the valvular anatomy of the internal iliac veins and its tributaries is limited. We dissected 82 iliac venous system specimens in 42 human cadavers (29 men, 13 women) to gain information on the relationship between the disease described and the anatomy of the region. Each specimen contained common, external, and internal iliac veins, including the tributaries of the latter. We recorded the anatomic variations of the internal iliac vein trunk and the location of valves in the complete iliac venous system, including 485 tributaries of the internal iliac veins. Five specimens of internal iliac vein had calcified thrombosis or were extensively involved with pelvic carcinoma and were not suitable for valve study, which left 79 specimens for analysis. The internal iliac vein drained into the external iliac venous system by means of a single trunk in 73% of the specimens and by two well-formed and separated trunks in 27% of the specimens. In one specimen (1.2%) the internal iliac vein drained directly into the inferior vena cava (parallel internal and external iliac veins). One specimen had a well-developed valve in the common iliac vein (1.2%). The external iliac vein had one valve in 26.2% of the specimens. This vein had three times as many valves on the right side as in the left (39.6% vs 14.6%: p = 0.0106).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, fewer endarterectomies are performed for treatment of occlusive arterial disease; more often a bypass procedure is done. This study investigates whether the results of the semiclosed endarterectomy for unilateral iliofemoral occlusive disease indeed indicate a wider use of bypass procedures for such short obstructions. Ninety-four patients with an obstructed external iliac and common femoral artery, but with patent ipsilateral common iliac and contralateral iliac arteries, underwent 101 operations. Seven of these patients were operated on at a later stage for occlusive disease on the contralateral side. Ninety-three endarterectomies were performed, and an iliofemoral bypass graft was inserted eight times because an endarterectomy was not feasible. Sixty-two operations were performed for disabling claudication, and 39 operations were performed for limb-threatening ischemia. Eighty-five percent of the patients who underwent an endarterectomy for disabling claudication became asymptomatic. Eighty percent of the patients who underwent an endarterectomy for limb-threatening ischemia became asymptomatic or improved to claudication. After endarterectomy no deaths, false aneurysms, or infections occurred. The patency rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 94%, 83%, and 65%, respectively. We conclude that the semiclosed endarterectomy with the ringstripper of a unilateral obstruction of one external iliac and common femoral artery can be performed with a low morbidity and without deaths and gives good long-term results.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacokinetics of prophylactic antibodies may differ in cardiac and aortic aneurysm surgery for at least two reasons: aortic aneurysm surgery generally entails a greater blood volume loss and replacement, and aortic aneurysm surgery usually does not require extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass. We prospectively studied two different cefamandole dosing regimens in patients undergoing aortic aneurysm surgery (phase 1, 1 gm intravenously at the induction of anesthesia; phase 2, 2 gm intravenously at the induction of anesthesia followed by 1 gm intravenously every 2 hours during surgery). In phase 1 and 2 plasma levels were measured at the time of skin incision, aortic cross-clamping, aortic unclamping, and skin closure. In phase 2 cefamandole elimination in urine and cell-saver effluent was also determined. An adequate plasma level of 10 micrograms/ml was maintained in only 4 of 14 patients in phase 1, but in 10 of 10 patients in phase 2. Cefamandole loss in cell-saver effluent was 136 +/- 100 mg, which was 13% of the measured renally excreted amount. As has been previously shown in cardiac surgery, a cefamandole prophylactic antibiotic regimen of 2 gm intravenously at the induction of anesthesia followed by 1 gm every 2 hours during surgery provides a dependable and practical dosing regimen in patients undergoing aortic aneurysm surgery.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to illustrate the application of computer simulation to the study of blood flow through arteries and to demonstrate the relationship between geometry of the vessels and local flow patterns. A finite element computer program was developed to simulate steady and pulsatile blood flow by solving the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations. The accuracy of the computational method has been confirmed by comparing the numeric results to analytic solutions and to published experimental data from physical models. The results are presented as plots of the velocity vectors, streamlines, and pressure contours. The computational model has been applied to illustrate flow patterns in the following situations: pulsatile flow in a cylindric artery and an artery with an axisymmetric stenosis, steady flow in cylindric arteries with stenoses of varying severity and with different flow rates, steady flow in an artery containing a fusiform aneurysm, steady flow in a two-dimensional model of a symmetric Y-shaped bifurcation, and steady flow in a two-dimensional model of the carotid bifurcation. Regions that are commonly associated with arterial disease often coincide with zones of reversed or stagnant flow. In conclusion, the versatility and feasibility of computational simulation of blood flow is illustrated by this study. Although this mathematic model is a simplification of the real flow phenomena, it yields results that provide useful insights into the understanding of local blood flow patterns for a variety of complex geometries.",

    "abstract": "Direct, noninvasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow to the human extremity is now possible by means of a flow measurement instrument that is based on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance. The instrument uses a physically independent calibration module as a primary calibration standard. Volumetric calibration of this module indicates that it is precise and accurate over the range of 0 to 100 ml/min. The calibration module is used, in turn, to calibrate an electromagnetic flow sensor that is incorporated into the instrumentation. The calibration module and the electromagnetic sensor were found to be linearly related over the range of 5 to 100 ml/min, with a regression correlation coefficient of 0.996. The calibrated electromagnetic flow sensor is used as a secondary standard for calibration of the nuclear magnetic resonance sensor. Blood flow measurements, obtained by use of this method, agree closely with those obtained by plethysmographic methods. They differ from the plethysmographic results in that magnetic resonance flows will distinguish between the at-rest blood flow in the normal extremity and the flows seen in the extremity (also at rest) with claudication. Based on the results obtained from studying a limited number of limbs with a high degree of ischemia, the method will not distinguish the limb with ischemia from the limb with claudication. Limitations of the method and refinements required to make the method clinically useful are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Forty-three patients, 24 with crossover femoral saphenous vein bypasses and 19 with saphenopopliteal vein bypasses, were observed for a mean of 5.5 years. All underwent preoperative and sequential postoperative clinical, hemodynamic and foot venous pressure measurement, and anatomic evaluations (duplex and venography). Seventy-one percent of patients undergoing crossover femoral saphenous vein bypasses and 74% of patients undergoing saphenopopliteal vein bypasses had an abnormal preoperative maximum venous outflow, in contrast to 4% and 11% after operation (p = 0.0183). The mean immediate postoperative maximum venous outflow improvement for patients having crossover femoral saphenous vein bypasses and those having saphenopopliteal vein bypasses was 16 and 17 ml, respectively, and the mean late improvement was 19 and 27 ml, respectively. Ninety percent of the patients undergoing crossover femoral vein bypasses and those having saphenopopliteal vein bypasses had abnormal foot venous pressures in contrast to 18% and 22% after operation. The final clinical outcomes (over 1 year) for both patients having the crossover saphenous vein bypasses and those having saphenopopliteal vein bypasses, respectively, were significant improvement (+3 and +2), 63% and 58%; significant worsening (-2), 4% and 5%. Eighty-eight percent of patients undergoing crossover femoral saphenous vein bypasses and 79% of patients undergoing saphenopopliteal vein bypasses with abnormal preoperative maximum venous outflow measurements had significant clinical improvement. In contrast, 86% of patients undergoing crossover femoral saphenous vein bypasses and 80% of patients undergoing saphenopopliteal vein bypasses with normal preoperative maximum venous outflow had no improvement. Seventy-seven percent of patients having saphenopopliteal vein bypasses and a normal venous refill time had significant improvement, in contrast to 17% for patients with an abnormal venous refill time (less than 10 sec). Sixty-seven percent of patients undergoing crossover femoral saphenous vein bypasses and 78% of patients undergoing saphenopopliteal vein bypasses with abnormal foot venous pressure measurements had significant improvement. The cumulative 7-year patency was 75% for patients having crossover femoral saphenous vein bypasses and 56% for those having saphenopopliteal vein bypasses. The operative mortality rate was 0% for both procedures, and the complication rate was 4% and 10%, respectively. The most important preoperative variables that correlated with a good outcome were a low preoperative maximum venous outflow, venous refill time greater than 10 sec, and venous claudication and iliac vein compression. Patients with a normal maximum venous outflow measurement and severe venous reflux should not be candidates for these bypasses.",

    "abstract": "Low dose heparin therapy has been used routinely for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis, yet in vitro data regarding its antithrombotic effects are sparse. The effects of heparin on venous thrombus formation were studied in an in vitro perfusion system. Fresh blood collected from human volunteers was treated with varying heparin doses and perfused at a shear rate of 100 sec-1 over everted, injured porcine vein segments, simulating conditions in the venous circulation. Platelet and fibrin deposition were measured by use of indium 111 and iodine 125 radiolabels, respectively. The effects of heparin on the intrinsic coagulation cascade were monitored by the activated clotting time. Increasing doses of heparin resulted in significant reductions in fibrin and platelet deposition (ANOVA F = 2.67 and 3.17, respectively, p less than 0.05). At a dose of only 0.19 USP units/ml blood, equivalent to a 1000 unit bolus of heparin in a 70 kg man, a noticeable reduction in both fibrin and platelet deposition was observed without an increase in the activated clotting time. These data confirm the antithrombotic effects of heparin at low dose ranges and may explain the clinically observed phenomenon of deep venous prophylaxis without an appreciable alteration in the conventional coagulation assays.",

    "abstract": "Large veins (superior and inferior vena cava, portal vein) have been replaced successfully with lower extremity deep veins (superficial femoral-popliteal). Femoropopliteal bypass with superficial femoral-popliteal veins has been reported to give excellent long-term results. Nevertheless, this source of autogenous veins has not gained acceptance, in part because of the fear that deep vein removal will result in severe venous outflow restriction in the donor limb. To assess the clinical and functional effect of excising a deep vein, we compared a group of limbs in which the superficial femoral-popliteal vein was resected for use as a femoropopliteal bypass graft (25 legs) with a control group of 22 legs in which a saphenous vein or polytetrafluoroethylene graft was used for femoropopliteal bypass. No significant differences were found in age or sex distribution, time from surgery to the venous test, side of bypass, or the incidence of postoperative extremity swelling, either early or late. A mild but significant calf enlargement was observed in the deep vein group (p less than 0.05), and a pattern consistent with venous outflow obstruction was shown by plethysmography in 21 of 25 extremities (84%) in which a deep vein was used for femoropopliteal bypass but in only 11 of 22 (50%) control extremities (p less than 0.02). It is concluded that a lower extremity deep veins should be considered as a suitable replacement for a large vein or, when superficial vein is not available, as an infrainguinal arterial substitute.",

Twenty-four patients (32%) propagated and 11 of these 24 (46%) into the popliteal or larger veins of the thigh. Sex, age, obesity, trauma, estrogen use, malignancy, varicose veins, smoking, surgery, and activity level were not predictive for proximal propagation. Proximal soleal vein thrombi had the highest incidence in both propagating and non-propagating groups. Thrombus extent and bilateral involvement were not predictive of propagation. Five percent (4 of 75 patients) had highly probable ventilation perfusion scans as their initial indication for duplex scanning. Deep vein thrombosis isolated to the calf is not a benign problem. If anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, the progress of the thrombus can be followed by duplex scanning.",

    "abstract": "The Greenfield vena caval filter has become the preferred method of vena caval filtration. Its high long-term patency rate and low complication rate make it ideal for those patients in whom anticoagulation has failed or is contraindicated. A known complication of filter insertion is the inadvertent placement or migration of the filter to the right side of the heart. We present three cases from our institution where the Greenfield filter was inadvertently ejected into the right atrium. An attempt at removal with a wire loop and sheath in two cases failed and resulted in the migration of one filter to the right inferior pulmonary artery. We found no evidence of long-term complications at 2, 45, and 60 months. We conclude that conservative management may be considered in these cases.",

    "abstract": "The expected patency and the potential complications of CO2 laser-welded end-to-end venous anastomoses have not been well established despite increasing clinical interest in the subject. To further study this relatively new technique we used the internal jugular veins (1.0 to 1.4 mm diameter) of 15 New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2.5 to 3.5 kg. On one randomly selected side, a laser-welded end-to-end anastomosis was performed in all animals by placing three equidistant stay sutures followed by welding the vein edges with a CO2 laser (spot size of 0.27 mm, power of 100 mW, and power density of 175 W/cm2). On the contralateral side, the vein was anastomosed with interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures in 10 animals, and in the remaining five animals a continuous 10-0 nylon suture technique was used. All anastomoses were surgically assessed at 30 days after operation. A significantly lower 30-day patency rate (p less than 0.05, Fisher's Exact Test) was found in anastomoses constructed by use of the continuous technique (20%) compared with either interrupted (90%) or the laser-assisted technique (87%). No significant difference was observed in 30-day patency between laser-assisted and conventional interrupted anastomoses. Anastomoses performed with the continuous and the laser-assisted technique required 12.5 +/- 1.3 and 12.9 +/- 3.0 minutes, respectively, whereas those constructed with interrupted technique required 19.1 +/- 4.5 minutes (p less than 0.05, Student-Neuman-Keuls' Test). No evidence of false or true aneurysm was noted in any of the animals. Histologic evaluation of laser-assisted anastomoses demonstrated early full-thickness coagulation necrosis of the wall with reendothelialization by 7 days and complete healing by 30 days after the procedure. Conventional anastomoses showed reendothelialization and minimal necrosis near the sutures at 7 days, but healing was complete by 30 days after the procedure. The patency rate of vein anastomoses performed with the CO2 laser is excellent and superior to the one obtained with continuous sutures, and except for less operating time, the former technique does not appear to offer any significant advantage over the conventional interrupted suture technique for small vein anastomosis in this animal model up to 1 month of follow-up.",

Ten adolescent baboons were studied in pairs, with one animal receiving saline solution (B2, B4, B6, B8, B10) and one being exposed to thrombogenic reagents (B1, B3, B5, B7, B9). These reagents represented a combination of a monoclonal antibody (HPC4) to protein C, 1 to 4 mg/kg administered over 5 minutes, and tumor necrosis factor administered over 3 minutes at a dose of 150 micrograms/kg through a catheter placed into the left superficial femoral vein with distal ligation. To encourage stasis, a pediatric size blood pressure cuff was inflated to 40 mm Hg on the right thigh for 50 minutes of every hour during the first experimental day (day 1) in B5 to B10. The animals were observed for a 6-hour period on day 1 and then for an 11- to 15-day period until sacrifice. Hemodynamic and hematologic parameters were recorded along with duplex imaging of the iliac veins and inferior vena cava on a daily basis. Venography was performed on day 1, day 4, and the day of sacrifice. At sacrifice the entire iliac and vena caval system was carefully dissected, opened, and photographed. Experimental animals given the HPC4 and tumor necrosis factor developed left iliac vein thrombosis extending into the inferior vena cava. Duplex imaging, venography, and autopsy revealed that control animals receiving saline solution never developed comparable thrombus. Experimental subjects exhibited thrombus on duplex imaging by day 4 (B1), day 3 (B3), day 2 (B5), 120 minutes (B7), and 360 minutes (B9) after receiving HPC4 and tumor necrosis factor. Venograms performed on day 1 exhibited thrombus in B5, B7, and B9. The extent of thrombus, the timing of its occurrence, and its effect on the animals' left leg followed a dose-dependent relationship for the animals in which the occlusive blood pressure cuff was used. Significantly greater declines in blood pressure, white blood cell count, and platelet count were found in affected animals given HPC4 and tumor necrosis factor reagents as compared to control subjects. All affected animals demonstrated the appearance of fibrin split products and a markedly prolonged prothrombin time. This investigation, for the first time, establishes a reproducible model of deep venous thrombosis involving inhibition of protein C that will facilitate further laboratory studies on venous thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "This report evaluates the ability of a single competent (native or experimental) superficial femoral vein valve to correct canine hindlimb venous insufficiency. The time to maximal ankle venous pressure after standing (VFT) and to 90% of that time after exercise (VRT90), and the minimal pressure after exercise (AVP) were measured in 17 greyhounds before intervention, after only the superficial femoral vein valve remained (n = 5), and after complete lower limb venous valvulotomy (n = 17). Three weeks later, 12 dogs underwent a native (n = 4) or experimental (n = 8) autogenous venous valve transplantation. Immediately and at 3 weeks after transplantation, venous pressure measurements were obtained. The manual strip test confirmed valve competence at the time of sacrifice. Only one valve transplant became incompetent. Immediately after single superficial femoral vein valve construction, VFT, AVP, and VRT90 measurements were not significantly different from normal. Three weeks after transplantation the AVP measurements were consistent with an insufficient venous system, whereas the VRT90 measurements were between and statistically different from both the control and totally incompetent system (p less than 0.05). After the native valve but not the experimental valve transplantations VFT normalized. These data suggest that insertion of a single competent superficial femoral vein valve into an incompetent lower limb venous system corrects venous pressure measurements initially but soon provides only a partially competent system. The experimental valve, although competent, is less responsive than a native valve.",

    "abstract": "Thrombomodulin is an endothelial surface thrombin receptor. Thrombin bound to thrombomodulin loses all procoagulant activity and instead activates the protein C anticoagulant pathway. We developed a recombinant thrombomodulin analog and compared the effects of recombinant thrombomodulin (100 micrograms/ea), saline (controls), recombinant hirudin (1.0 mg/kg), and heparin (100 units/kg) on thrombus formation, activated partial thromboplastin time, and tail transection bleeding time in a rat model of stasis-induced venous thrombosis. Results showed that thrombus was detected in the vena cava in six of the six rats treated with saline solution, in zero of the six rats treated with recombinant thrombomodulin (p less than 0.05), in one of six rats treated with recombinant hirudin (p less than 0.05), and in zero of six rats treated with heparin (p less than 0.05). The activated partial thromboplastin time in rats receiving recombinant thrombomodulin was slightly longer than controls (22 +/- 8 vs 37 +/- 6, p less than 0.05). The bleeding times in rats receiving recombinant thrombomodulin were approximately twice as long as controls (215 +/- 68 vs 545 +/- 173, p = 0.037). In all rats treated with recombinant hirudin or heparin, activated partial thromboplastin times were greater than 120 seconds and bleeding times were greater than 1200 seconds. We conclude that recombinant thrombomodulin inhibits venous thrombosis in a rat model with less prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and bleeding time than heparin or hirudin.",

    "abstract": "One potential complication of carotid disease is progression to total occlusion while under medical management. To investigate this important issue, 44 patients (31 men; 13 women) ranging in age from 44 to 83 (mean, 65.9) years with internal carotid artery occlusions as a result of arteriosclerosis were identified among 993 patients undergoing carotid angiography from Jan. 1, 1985 to Dec. 31, 1989, and their prior medical records were reviewed. Clinical presentations included stroke in 9 (20.5%), retinal infarct in 8 (18.2%), transient ischemic attacks in 10 (22.7%), amaurosis fugax in 4 (9.1%), nonhemispheric symptoms in 3 (6.8%), and 10 (22.7%) were asymptomatic. A review of these patients' medical records documented that prior hemispheric symptoms referrable to the now occluded internal carotid artery had occurred in five (55%) of the nine patients who were admitted with stroke, five (62%) of the eight patients with a retinal infarct, six (60%) of the 10 patients who were admitted with a transient ischemic attack, all four (100%) patients who were admitted with amaurosis fugax, one (33%) of three patients with nonhemispheric symptoms, and in seven (70%) of the 10 patients who were asymptomatic when the internal carotid artery occlusion was identified angiographically. In summary, 28 (64%) of the 44 patients had experienced ipsilateral symptoms from 2 to 120 (mean, 30) months before the diagnosis of internal carotid artery occlusion; only eight (28%) had undergone noninvasive or angiographic evaluation, and all were placed on antiplatelet therapy when prior hemispheric symptoms developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Outcome of 113 operations for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms were reviewed to determine the contribution of perioperative events to mortality rates. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were examined with regard to their influence on early and late deaths. A mortality rate of 64% (72/113) was unrelated to age, gender, and preexistent medical conditions. Death within 48 hours occurred in 42 of 72 patients (58%). Preoperative status, including cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, and acidosis influenced early deaths (less than 48 hours) but not late deaths. Early deaths were also influenced by severe operative hypotension and excessive transfusion requirements. Late deaths (greater than 48 hours) occurred in 30/72 cases (42%) at a mean of 24.6 +/- 22.9 days. Late death was related to postoperative organ system failure, specifically renal and respiratory failure, and the need for reoperation. The overall mortality rate was influenced by preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. Postoperative renal failure was the strongest predictor of overall deaths. Survival after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm depends on intraoperative and postoperative complications as well as preoperative conditions. Late death, the greatest strain on resources, is independent of preoperative status. The thesis that some patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should be denied operation to conserve resources is not supported by these data. Efforts to improve survival should focus on reducing intraoperative complications and improving management of postoperative organ failure.",

    "abstract": "Conventional angiography is the current standard for the evaluation of carotid artery disease. The excellent resolution of this invasive study is offset by the potential for contrast-related, embolic, and puncture site complications. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography may offer a noninvasive diagnostic alternative. We examined this possibility by performing both conventional angiography and three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography in 13 patients. Cervical duplex scans were also obtained in these patients. Contiguous transverse cervical magnetic resonance images were acquired in a 1.5 tesla magnet, by use of a posterior neck coil and a gradient echo pulse sequence. These \"raw\" data were transferred to a real-time workstation where three-dimensional cervical arterial images were reformatted, magnified, and examined from multiple angles. Total study time from patient positioning to image generation was approximately 30 minutes. In all patients, on three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography the common, external, and internal carotid arteries and distal vertebral arteries were easily discernable and correctly identified as patent, stenotic, or occluded. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography was not accurate in detecting carotid ulcers. The degree of internal carotid artery stenosis measured from the three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography studies correlated well with the internal carotid artery stenosis measured with conventional angiography (r = 0.866, r2 = 75.1%, p = less than or equal to 0.0001). This recent technologic advance represents significant progress toward achieving the goal of completely noninvasive vascular assessment in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective review was undertaken of a random sample (N = 73) comprising 50% of carotid endarterectomies performed during 1986 to evaluate the necessity of routine postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission after carotid endarterectomy. Severity of illness was determined with use of the Acute Physiology Score of the APACHE II system. The Therapeutic Index Scoring System was used to quantify postoperative services used. Postoperative morbidity was analyzed. Financial impact was extrapolated with use of 1990 billing data. Length of ICU stay was 24.5 hours. Only 13 of 73 patients (18%) required ICU services. In 10 (77%) of these patients therapy was initiated in the recovery room and discontinued in six patients within 3 hours of ICU admission. Only two patients required ICU services for 16 hours after surgery. The mean Acute Physiology Score was low (4.96) and could not identify patients who required unique ICU services. Neurologic deficits were seen in five patients (6.9%). In three cases deficits were recognized in the recovery room; deficits developed in two patients after discharge from the ICU. Observation in the recovery room with transfer of stable patients would have eliminated ICU admission in 60 patients (82%). In 1990 the incremental ICU charge was $720/patient day. This represents 12.5% of the hospital charges for carotid endarterectomy. The ICU is an expensive and highly used hospital resource. Only a few patients need unique ICU services after carotid endarterectomy, and this is usually apparent within 2 hours of surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Blunt carotid artery trauma is an uncommon but potentially dangerous clinical entity. We report eight patients from a 10-year interval who sustained blunt injuries to the carotid arteries. Six of eight patients suffered a hyperextension injury or had a cervical spine fracture or both. Arteriography revealed four arterial dissections and four thrombotic occlusions. Two asymptomatic common carotid artery occlusions and one dissection with transient ischemic attacks had successful arterial reconstructions. Five patients were treated nonoperatively: three internal carotid artery dissections with minor or no neurologic deficit; one asymptomatic thrombosis; and one internal carotid artery thrombosis with a major fixed neurologic deficit that did not improve. No patient died, and seven of eight made a complete neurologic recovery or remained asymptomatic. The diagnosis of blunt carotid artery injuries should be suspected in patients with neck hyperextension injuries or with cervical spine fractures as well as in patients with neurologic deficits not explained by intracranial trauma. Duplex scanning may be a useful noninvasive study. Surgery is indicated for selected patients with accessible lesions who have minor or no neurologic deficits. Asymptomatic patients with small intimal flaps or dissections may be successfully treated nonoperatively.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound criteria for the diagnosis of celiac and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusive disease have not been well defined. We performed a blinded retrospective comparison of mesenteric duplex data with arteriography in 24 consecutive patients who underwent both studies. Arteriography revealed that eight superior mesenteric arteries were normal; five were minimally stenotic; eight had stenoses greater than or equal to 50%, and three were occluded. Nine celiac arteries were normal or minimally stenotic; 12 had stenoses greater than or equal to 50%, and three were occluded. Duplex scans were obtained after an overnight fast. In normal superior mesenteric arteries, peak systolic velocity (PSV) was 134 +/- 18 cm/sec and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) was 24 +/- 4 cm/sec. Superior mesenteric artery PSV in patients with minimal or no stenosis (171 +/- 22 cm/sec) was less than PSV in patients with severe (greater than 50%) stenosis (299 +/- 40 cm/sec, p = 0.006), and less than PSV in patients with patent superior mesenteric arteries who underwent revascularization (366 +/- 86 cm/sec, p = 0.017). Similarly, EDV was elevated in superior mesenteric arteries with severe stenosis (78 +/- 11 cm/sec, p = 0.001) and in patients who underwent revascularization (111 +/- 19 cm/sec, p less than 0.001) compared to those with less than 50% stenosis (30 +/- 6 cm/sec, p = 0.001). An EDV greater than 45 cm/sec was the best indicator of severe stenosis (sensitivity, 1.0; specificity, 0.92). Peak systolic velocity greater than 300 cm/sec was less sensitive (0.63), but highly specific (1.0) for severe superior mesenteric artery stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Operative repair was undertaken for 51 popliteal aneurysms in 39 patients between 1958 and 1990. Operation was performed on an emergency basis in 19 extremities with limb-threatening ischemia and as an elective procedure in 32 extremities. Cumulative limb salvage (94%) rates and patency rates (67%) became significantly different at 6 years (p less than 0.05). Graft patency was affected by clinical presentation and runoff. After 1 year, cumulative patency for extremities with limb-threatening ischemia was significantly lower than for those having an elective operation (69% vs 100%, p less than 0.05). Runoff did not influence graft patency until 3 years, at which time cumulative patency was better in extremities with good runoff than in extremities with poor runoff (89% vs 30%, p less than 0.05). Limb salvage was affected only by presentation. All limb loss (three patients) occurred within the first month in extremities with graft occlusion after operation for limb-threatening ischemia. Runoff did not influence patency rates for extremities with limb-threatening ischemia, since no difference was observed in runoff between the two groups. We conclude that elective repair is indicated in all patients with popliteal aneurysms. It is associated with little risk to the patient, and prevents the need for operation in the setting of limb-threatening ischemia with its poorer overall results and definite incidence of amputation.",

    "abstract": "A prospective evaluation of 213 consecutive infrainguinal bypass procedures was performed to determine the effect of anesthesia technique on the postoperative complication rate. Limb salvage was the indication for surgery in 92% of cases. No significant differences were observed in age, sex, indication for surgery, presence of cardiovascular and pulmonary risk factors, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, or Goldman scores between patients receiving epidural anesthesia and those receiving general endotracheal anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia was used for 96 procedures and general endotracheal anesthesia was used in 117 cases. Cardiac complications for the epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia groups, respectively, included a mortality rate of 5% versus 3%, nonfatal infarctions in 6% versus 7%, and reversible cardiac events in 14% versus 16%. A high-risk subgroup of 69 patients (American Surgical Association classes IV and V or Goldman score greater than 10 points) also had no significant difference in outcome between epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia. Major noncardiac complications occurred in an additional 8% of each group. Regional and general anesthesia therefore produce equivalent cardiovascular risk for infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. These results suggest that indicated operations should not be postponed or avoided for patients either requiring or requesting general anesthesia. Furthermore, other investigations of cardiac risk in vascular surgery do not require a uniform anesthetic technique for valid interpretation of results.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in arterial blood flow are thought to predispose to thrombus formation, but the exact relationships have not been fully elucidated. The effect of varying blood flows on the accumulation of thrombotic material within arteries was investigated, with use of shear rate as an index of flow across the luminal surface. Partially denuded rabbit aortas were perfused with fresh nonanticoagulated human blood for 3 minutes, with an in vitro recirculating apparatus, Indium 111-labeled platelets, and fibrinogen I 125. Shear rates ranged from zero to 1500 sec-1, correlating with the hemodynamics of various segments of the human arterial tree. A significant correlation was observed between shear rate and platelet deposition, ranging from 5.2 +/- 2.8 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 of vessel surface area at zero shear to a maximum of 64.7 +/- 8.3 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 at a shear rate of 1500 sec-1 (F = 5.01, p less than 0.05). Fibrin deposition paralleled that of platelets, ranging from 28.2 +/- 7.6 micrograms/cm2 at zero shear to 354.1 +/- 62.7 micrograms/cm2 at a shear rate of 1500 sec-1 (F = 5.91, p less than 0.05). These results suggest that shear rate is a most important determinant of platelet and fibrin deposition on altered arterial surfaces.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our 12-year experience with transaxillary first rib resection in 136 patients screened by neurologists and thought to have neurologic thoracic outlet syndrome to determine what factors affected outcome. These patients represented 85% of the operative experience in a referral area of 1.2 million people. Patients were recalled every 2 years for surveillance. The mean follow-up was 60 +/- 7 months. There were no brachial plexus or vascular injuries. Secondary operations in the neck were required in 20 patients. The quality of the operative result was determined by whether the patient was able to return to preillness activities and whether the patient would undergo operation again if the same result would be obtained. The most important determinant of result was a history of trauma precipitating the neurologic symptoms, particularly in women. Only 25 of the 53 patients (47%) with a history of trauma returned to preillness activities compared to 65 of the 83 patients (78%) without such a history. Overall patient satisfaction was not affected by trauma. Thirty-eight of the 53 patients with trauma (72%) and 69 of the 83 patients (83%) without trauma were satisfied. When the men and women were analyzed separately men were found to have better results after trauma than did women. Other factors with a negative impact on operative results were the need to return to an activity that required repetitive arm movements, coverage under a worker's compensation insurance policy, and fixed joint abnormalities or neurologic findings in the upper extremity. The presence of an anatomic abnormality had no effect on operative results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Color-flow duplex scanning of infrainguinal vein bypasses was used to identify failing grafts. Several duplex parameters were compared to determine their value in identifying and quantifying the degree of stenosis. Intraarterial digital subtraction angiography was used as the \"gold standard\" to determine the severity of the stenosis. The goal of this study was to identify specific color-flow duplex criteria for grading stenotic lesions. After a retrospective analysis some of these parameters were prospectively validated. The surveillance protocol required a color-flow duplex scan every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months during the second year. One hundred sixteen vein grafts in 112 patients were studied. Forty-three stenoses were identified and classified into categories from 30% to 49%, 50% to 69%, and 70% to 99% diameter reduction. These stenoses were identified in either the bypass graft or adjacent inflow or outflow arteries. Failing grafts were evaluated further by intraarterial digital subtraction angiography. Patients with normal appearing bypasses (without suspected stenotic lesions) had intravenous digital subtraction angiography. The five duplex parameters that were studied included the following: (1) graft peak systolic velocity (PSV-graft), (2) the maximum peak systolic velocity (at the site of a stenosis or in normal grafts at the narrowest segment of the bypass) (PSV-max), (3) the ratio between PSV-graft and PSV-max, (PSV-index), (4) end-diastolic velocity (EDV) at a stenosis or from narrowest graft segment, (5) color-flow image diameter measurements. For discrimination of different degrees of stenosis, threshold values of these parameters were calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Diameter reduction measured by color-flow imaging was best to identify all stenotic lesions greater than 29% (sensitivity 88%, specificity 99%). Peak systolic velocity-index proved optimal identification of stenoses greater than 49% (sensitivity 89%, specificity 92%), and 70% to 99% stenoses were associated with increased EDV (sensitivity 91%, specificity 100%). The PSV-index criteria were then validated prospectively in a separate group of vein grafts. The data support the value of surveillance of femorodistal vein grafts and demonstrate that calculation of the degree of graft stenosis is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Between Jan. 1, 1980, and Dec. 31, 1989, 2187 infrainguinal revascularization procedures were performed. In 130 of these cases with patent bypasses, hemodynamic deterioration was suspected, and urgent arteriography was performed. Twenty additional patients with aortofemoral, femorofemoral, or axillofemoral bypasses demonstrated hemodynamic deterioration. In 93% of failing grafts the condition was suspected because of recurrent symptoms or changes in the pulse examination. Two hundred eighty-five high-grade stenotic or occlusive lesions were identified in inflow arteries, outflow arteries, within the graft, or at proximal or distal anastomoses associated with these 150 grafts. One hundred sixty-one (57%) of these lesions were in patients with failing vein grafts; 115 (40%) were in patients with failing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts; and 9 (3%) were associated with failing composite vein/PTFE grafts. Stenotic lesions less than 5 cm in length were initially treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA). Occlusive lesions, stenoses greater than 5 cm in length, and PTA failures were treated surgically. The overall 6-year cumulative secondary patency rate for failing grafts was 65%, and the limb salvage rate was 75%. The extended patency rate after the first intervention in the failing state was 56% at 5 years. The 5-year secondary patency rate for grafts initially treated with PTA (58%) was not significantly different (p = 0.25) from that for grafts treated initially with surgery (71%). Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was effective for inflow stenoses of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries and for some outflow lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study compared new and traditional measures of platelet function in 16 patients with severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease and 15 age-matched controls. Circulating platelets were characterized by the use of fluorescence flow cytometry to assess platelet aggregate formation and expression of the secretion-dependent alpha granule membrane protein GMP-140, by measurement of plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), and by performance of platelet-rich plasma aggregation studies. In addition, blood samples were treated with graded concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 0 to 10 mumols/L) to characterize by fluorescence flow cytometry the secretory and aggregatory responses to mild stimulation. No differences were detected between the two groups with regard to platelet function in unstimulated circulating blood by use of these techniques. Values (mean +/- SEM) observed were: GMP-140-positive platelets, 11% +/- 3% versus 13% +/- 2%; platelet aggregates in circulating whole blood, 4% +/- 1% versus 9% +/- 3%; plasma beta-TG, 92 +/- 12 versus 94 +/- 22 ng/ml; and ED50 (concentration of ADP required to produce half maximal aggregation), 3.8 +/- 1.1 versus 3.1 +/- 0.5 mumol/L in the patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and controls, respectively. Treatment with ADP caused a dose-related increase in GMP-140 expression in both groups, without significant differences in this parameter between the groups at any given concentration. However, stimulation with ADP concentrations greater than 1 mumol/L resulted in more frequent aggregate formation in the control than in the peripheral arterial occlusive disease group (25% +/- 4% versus 11% +/- 2%, respectively at 5.0 mumols/L, p = 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
